{"text":"Average at best. Been here twice, twice got chewy bulgogi that tasted old. Grey and chewy and too sweet.

Sushi is terrible. 

Avoid. 

If you want sushi, go elsewhere. Like anywhere else.

If you want Korean BBQ, go to Cafe Ga Hyang.

Never again."}
{"text":"Restaurant is cute, Korean dishes and sides amazing.  Great sushi prices.  Will go again"}
{"text":"Went there last night. Was the worst service Ive ever had. Was there for 2 hours and the waitress helped us once. All she did was take out order then disappeared. I had to ask 2 other waitresses for our drinks 20min later. It was so awful. The sushi was good but service was awful!!!"}
{"text":"Love how they made the place with later hours.. the bulgogi and kimchi tofu soup is very tasty and packed with flavor... The atmosphere of the resto is very clean and chill. I'll for sure be going back. Very good Korean restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"We were there in the afternoon and the place was pretty empty but the food was excellent we ordered the Korean BBQ combo for 2-3 people and it was plenty of food for us, I would say it feeds 4 people. We ordered spring rolls and dumplings as appetizers and it was really good. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went to Ohya late Saturday afternoon.  My husband and I had only tried Korean food one other time.  Our daughter is more familiar with Korean food.  The restaurant was very clean, and I could see into the kitchen which looked clean.  Our server was very sweet, a little forgetful, but everyone has an off day.  We had fun with the table top grill.   My husband loved the grapefruit drink, and our server brought him a chilled glass with a salt rim when he said he thought it would be better that way.  We enjoyed our food, and will be trying it again soon.  Just a couple small things kept this from 5 stars.  Hopefully our next visit will be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night at around 9 pm and was able to find seating pretty quickly. 

Ambiance is trendy and fun, but dress is casual. Parking is public in a big lot.

My friend and I ordered a limited combo special where we got to pick one meat plate and one sushi roll. 

We ended up ordering 2 combos and got the Galbi and the Daeji Bulgogi for our meats and got the \"Ohya I forgot\" roll and the Dynamite roll. 

First, the meats were great. Very comparable to some Korean places in K-town of LA. I would definitely go back there for that. You have the option of cooking the meat yourself or having the kitchen cook it for you in the back. If you don't know how to BBQ well, then I definitely recommend you let the kitchen staff cook it for you. The traditional small plates that go with the BBQ were good too. 

Unfortunately, the sushi fell really flat. That's really why I'm not rating this 4 stars! The \"Ohya I forgot\" roll was way too big and the sauce they used on top was too sweet. They also put a lot of the sauce. For the Dynamite roll, the scallops were cooked ok, but they again put way too much sauce. I would recommend asking if they can put the sauce on the side so you can control how much you want to put on it. 

So, I will definitely come here for the BBQ and not for the sushi."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, all with different parties and for different purposes. In general, I do think this is the best choice for KBBQ on this side of Phoenix! Cheap, gives you the option of grilling, great prices, and great choices. Most Korean places in AZ no longer serve ddukbokki (spelling may vary) anymore, but this place does!

While I'm not a big fan of the lunch menu, it is a very good value if you're okay with the selection. I think the food is generally on point, and I'm a fan of their selection of side dishes (especially the fish cake and cucumber!). Definitely go for a tofu soup + meat combo for the most bang for your buck. The seafood pancake here is also absolutely delicious and huge for what you pay--especially compared to other Korean restaurants.

That being said, the restaurant does lose a star for fluctuations in food and service quality. Last time I was here with my parents, they messed up our order and wanted to give us a different meat dish than the one we ordered. We insisted on sticking with old order and just waiting. On the plus side, they got the correct dish out to us not long after we talked, but on the negative side, I don't think they would have caught it if I hadn't asked the waitress, and my family was certainly not impressed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it was terrible service. Second time we've been here and the service was still awful. The only reason we went back the second time was because their food is amazing. I don't know if we will be returning. Hopefully they update their staff."}
{"text":"Been here twice! Good is great and service is fast and friendly. Haven't tried the Korean BBQ yet but I will next time!"}
{"text":"If i was able to give this place negative stars i would. The service is absolute shit. The amount of food you get for all you can eat is ridiculous. If a sushi place claims to be all you can eat, then you should be able to pick and choose off that menu and it be unlimited. This sushi place only allows you to choose 6 rolls for all you can eat, meaning that it is NOT all you can eat. They also only bring out one roll per serving, so we're leafy sitting here still hungry while they slowly prepare our food. If you don't want to get all you can it, its worse. Your paying $10-$12 per roll for small rolls of sushi. It'd absoultly ridiculous. My fiance came to this place to have a date night and its the worst place to come and eat."}
{"text":"Took my wife's drink order as we were being seated, waited 25 minutes just to watch other tables finish their food, new people come in and get halfway done with beers and samplers without my order ever being taken! They took the table next to mines check and I got up and walked out. No one said a word my \"server\" just looked out of the kitchen. Never, ever again. I was at table 12, of of maybe 4 on a slow Sunday afternoon. Could the other servers even come check on us? I guess not."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried CGJ for the first time tonight! It was so good!! We bought K2 and K3 which are the bbq marinated beef and spicy pork. Since we ordered two dishes for the bbq, we were able to grill it on our table. We also ordered a soju to share :) and I ordered a coconut boba drink. We decided we liked the marinated beef more than the spicy pork because it tasted better with all of the sides they bring out. The spicy pork was very good though too (the other ingredients just got lost in its flavor). If you haven't had Korean bbq before, you grill the meat you select then wrap it in lettuce with your side dish selection.  As we left, my drunk husband said, \"This is the only way to eat lettuce!\" At first it was a little intimidating since we have never had Korean food before, but the waitress made us feel very welcomed and was very attentive (but not in the annoying way). I can't wait to go back and try something else!! :) Also, prepare to be full."}
{"text":"Really bad food and service. Not worth 40 dollars. Priority goes to people who order acholic drinks. 4 types of rolls and 1 set of 2 pc sweet shrimp. There is something wrong with the shrimp. Eww, my roommate said, \" it tasted like snot going done her throat.\" Ps. About the sweet shrimp. We got vegas , spider, tootsie, and cali. The only decent food we got tonight was the vegas rolls. I also ordered a coke and never recieved it.  The service was really slow. I mean anyone who had acholic drinks got served more often and faster than we did. Worst dinner ever. Never coming back. Take our suggestion and go elsewhere. Stay clear of this place. Plus, our table had been scratched and marked up by people to the point it looks like a ragged table in the middle of a nice looking place with horrible food."}
{"text":"November 2012, I came here on a Saturday night and it was packed, you literally had to wait for someone to get up from their table to get a seat, yet alone a table! The air in there was so thick and smoky as a lot of people were grilling. So my date and I left and decided to come back another time.

A couple weeks later in November 2012, we came back on a Saturday night and the place was a ghost town! What happened to everyone?! It was my date's first time actually being able to sit down at the restaurant, so we decided to stay. We ordered Ddobuuki, Bulgogi and Galbi dishes. When the food came out and was placed on the table, I knew why no one was there...

First off, I remember the Dukbokki, Bulgogi and Galbi dishes to be bigger, the size has changed but the price has remained the same. Hmmmm. The Bulgogi was bland and not fresh. The Galbi was too fatty and not at all what I remember it to be. The only dish that tasted the same was the Ddukbokki. The only upside was the side dishes. Alas, they have not changed one bit and were just as tasty as I remember. They have the best Kimchi in the Valley, but sadly, the Kimchi couldn't save our experience.

On a side note, I've been happily eating at this establishment for the past 4 years or so and have always had a great experience until my last visit in November of 2012. My experience prior to this was in June or July of 2012.

I may be back in the future, but since I've discovered Yume Sushi in North Scottsdale, which serves amazing Korean food, I doubt that I will be."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant and tasted great... 2nd time here after a long time.  Had the seafood soft tofu soup and bulgogi combination for only $ 13 .... Can't beat that....yummmmm and totally stuffed now.... no dinner for me tonight

The bulgogi was very well seasoned and extremely tender, and the soup was very very flavorful and with plenty of seafood and tofu in there...The side dishes are very fresh and good as well

And I love the furniture here, very well crafted and authentic... and the staffs are very friendly. 

Definitely highly recommended, especially if you live in the north scottsdale or phoenix area, this is much closer than driving down to tempe/chandler area for good asian food"}
{"text":"Service is very slow.  Placed an online order at 7:40pm..  Arrived at the restaurant at 8:10.  No one greeted us until 8:30 even though they saw me and a few other customers were waiting at the door..  They weren't that busy..  To make the matter worst, I came home and found out they forgot to give me the side dishes..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. It is so conveniently located and stays open late, a must for people who work evenings. But all I can say about this place is it's so inconsistent. One night everything might be decent, with fairly tasty food, late night hours and okay service. The next, the salmon sushi is the opposite of fresh, they bring you the wrong entree altogether, and the waitress abandons you to serve other tables (or maybe to join in on the karaoke, I was never quite clear which.) I have stopped coming here. Cheap sushi that might be horrible just leads to heartbreak, and I am too old to enjoy rolling the dice, especially where my pocketbook is involved. Essentially, unless you really like Karaoke or want to cook your food at the table (and you must buy a lot of food for that privilege) get your Korean or Japanese elsewhere. I am not naming names because I think it is a tacky thing to do in a review, but there really are other restaurants open as or almost as late that serve the same fare only better and more reliably."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a weekend recently.
Kimchi pancakes, spicy pork bbq lunch special.

The seasoning on the pork bbq wasn't what it used to be.
It seems like the texture is dried out and the flavor is bland.
The sauce is probably watered down.
It lost the yummy sauce/ flavor/ seasoning it used to have.

The kimchi pancakes weren't that great either.

I used to be so loyal to this place but after being let down the past couple times,
I think I might as well just cook at home (and deal with the dishes later)"}
{"text":"Authentic and standard place for Korean dishes . Stews, noodles, and entrees are standard portions and authentic. I have seen the karaoke rooms, but have never actually used them before. One of the few places that i've found that actually serves Makgeolli. Service is typically fine, except for all-you-can-eat-kbbq nights; then it gets bogged down and service is aweful."}
{"text":"I gave this amazing restaurant 5 stars two years ago, and they are still so deserving! I wrote that I thought I would become a regular, and boy am I ever. I have been coming here at least twice a week sinve i left my first review in 2014 and have NEVER been disappointed and I dont think I ever will be . Best quality, lowest price, best variety. It doesn't get any better than OHYA. I have brought everyone I know here and they always love it. If you are reading this because you haven't made up your mind, just GO. You can't possibly be upset with the prices and options. Best sushi I've ever had, and I know it will remain that way."}
{"text":"A severe food poisoning all day, sake cup soo dirty, we asked them a new one but still dirty, spicy tuna & hotate sushi weren't fresh, and grilled items is ok. It's not cool to pay 100$ for dinner after got food poisoning."}
{"text":"Reading through Google and Yelp, I see the polarization of views...  However, I can clarify this experience for the people who are lacking praise for this fantastic establishment.  My own experience was a first experience.  My wife and I were in the area and I mentioned this restaurant.  We immediately went there.  The people were friendly and the place looked like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant; which excited us as we have always been used to quality being found in such places.  The servers were friendly and gave the proper time to read the extensive menus.  By the way, the friendliness and professionalism of the staff must be weighed by the customs and cultures of the same.  Knowing cultures of Eastern Asia, I found everything to be fantastic.  Then, we thoroughly enjoyed the best sushi that I have tasted since New Jersey.  We also enjoyed some sample dishes of various sides.  The main course was this unbelievably amazing lamb.  I enjoyed hot sake with my meal, found everything to be beyond expectations, and left a fifty percent tip to the waitress.  As for the lamb, we took some home for the kids to try and got them hooked.  It is simple:  if you find yourself doubting this place, then Korean food will not be for you.  If you find the restaurant or staff lacking, you do not know where to find quality and have never been to New Jersey or New York.  This is the type of place where one must visit to find the good stuff.  If you question my scale of standards, understand that I am a harsh critic and extremely finicky when visiting any establishment.  I will be steering many people in this direction and I see many new people every week.  I have already told dozens of people that this is the spot."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch. We wanted to try the Korean BBQ. The place was being renovated. There were 2 servers and the place was not that busy. We ordered the Combo 4 BBQ. The Galbi was not marinated well. The pork belly was bland as it was not marinated at all. The spicy pork was good. They give you free sides and the Kim Chi was just so so. The service  was slow and inattentive. They had a 15% off yelp check in that they did not honor since they are changing the name of the restaurant but it is the same owner.  The waitress stated that it is more of a \"modern Asian\" cuisine, whatever that means. 

I would rather go to Takamatsu for KBBQ."}
{"text":"I was hopeful, but I was woefully disappointed.  Meat was not good.  Side dishes were not good.  \"Seafood\" Pancake hardly had any seafood...definitely not worth the price.  Everything tastes like it was a few days old.  The biggest criteria that I use when going to a Korean restaurant is to look around.  The place was busy, but I was the only Korean here.  Bad sign."}
{"text":"Great service, expansion coming soon, excellent food. Staff friendly and professional, always delivers extra items asked that does not normally come with KBBQ. (sauces and such)."}
{"text":"Food is decent but I had a groupon coupon of 25 dollars worth of sushi. I ended up getting sushi, dubbokki, and fried tempura. Me and my co worker ended up waiting 1 hour for our sushi the waitress came up to us 30 mins later saying the chef lost our paper and was sorry? But I thought it was bs. We ended up tipping them. Also, we had 3 different waitresses that came to our table 3 times and was at other people tables more. Poor service which needs to be improved."}
{"text":"Happy Mother's Day 2016.
I googled this restaurant and viewed their website prior to going there. I looked at their facebook page. I read reviews and watched pictures of food samples and what the restaurant looks like inside. The pictures are possibly from when the restaurant first opened. It does not look that anymore.  It is dark, cluttered, nasty looking, and smells bad. There is no air circulation. Your membranes are clogged by the smells of burnt food, burnt oil, and grease. The smell remained in my clothing and purse. When I got home and reach into my purse to get my reading glasses, the smell hit me in my face.

We drove in from Chandler and arrived at the restaurant close to 2pm.  We were seated immediately. I was not able to sit in my seat, because there were rice grains and food debris on the seat. I asked the waitress, if she can please clean off the seat. She said, sure, and with a towel, she brushed the rice grains and debris onto the floor.  Which caused me to look at the floor. The floor was nasty with food debris and droppings,  all around my seat and table, and as far as my eyes can see.

My husband asked me, \"honey would you like to leave\"? We should have left, but we drove far.  I thought, well, they say \"dirty dives are sometimes the best places for delicious food.\"  Wrong.

The restaurant's lighting is very dim almost dark. I reached for the menu. It was sticky to the touch. I tried to lift the menu off the table. The menu was stuck to the table. The table tops are wood and very sticky and dirty. The table tops are carved on by people, carved into with knives, like graffiti.
I asked the waitress for some napkins, so I can use them to cover the table, as a place setting.

We ordered five items off the menu, spicy seafood soup, teriyaki bowl, cucumber salad, (4) wings plain, shrimp tempura, and deep fried dumplings. None of these dishes had any taste. The cucumber salad was limp and soggy.

Our waitress was very nice and polite.  She has nothing to do with anything describe above.  We tipped appropriately."}
{"text":"I love to come here, the bento boxes are so good, and there are many to choose from.  The sushi is always good, I love the Vegas rolls and the tempora shrimp rolls, but do yourself a favor and also order the oh ya I forgot rolls, you'll see why.  Go in hungry come out satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"The serving sizes here are generous! We went for dinner and ordered a tofu soup, naeng myun and galbi combo, bibimbap and yook gae jang.  We were pleasantly surprised to receive rice bowls for all entrees (even the noodle dishes) and 6 great tasting side dishes. Our waiter even went out of the way to make a toddler straw cup by puncturing a straw over plastic wrap on a plastic cup. Service was prompt. 

Only thing is that the galbi was pretty thin and burnt a bit but all the dishes were delicious (especially the tofu soup). There is also no ventilation which created a smoky atmosphere from the grilling at the other tables (my parents complained of itchy watery eyes from the smoke). But overall we had a good experience!"}
{"text":"Not one single complaint, just recommendations... changing table for babies in the bathrooms and offer the Korean style spicy fried bbq chicken as a half order because the order is just too large for a smaller group that would like to have that entrée. All the food was super tasty, appetizers, sushi rolls, gyoza, yakisoba, and of course the fried chicken. No bs, the korean spicy fried chicken here is unbelievably good, easily the best fried chicken in town, no one else comes close. Sake bombers are on point too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give Ohya Korean restaurant a try since Tuesday is AYCE Korean BBQ and sushi for $24.95.

The restaurant was packed as expected and we had about a 25 minute wait before being seated.  Once at our tables, we started off with the Korean ribs for grilling and a couple of pieces of sushi.

They limit you to only one sushi and one raw meat order per customer per request.  While I understand they're trying to cut down on waste, this is very inconvenient for those of us who do not waste food.  Rather than hindering the majority they should charge any customer who waste food an extra charge.  Then only those who violate the rule would be penalized rather than all customers.

Now the review of the quality of the food and service.

Food:
The AYCE sushi menu is very limited compared to other similar establishments.  And when they bring out the nigiri sushi, it's limited to only one piece rather than the traditional two.  The maki rolls were very small in diameter and count.  As for taste, I'd rate them as okay with a few in the 'good' range.  But certainly nothing extraordinary.

The AYCE Korean BBQ taste was mediocre at best.  It wasn't bad by no means but it lacked the flavor that I'm accustomed to from other Korean restaurants.

On a side note, the grills in the table are electric heated rather than natural gas therefore there are no flames.  The electric heating elements takes a long time to adequately heat the metal grill so your raw meat cooks very slowly in fact too slowly.  And without the flames from a gas fire grill the meat lacks the charred texture and taste.

Service:
Our waitress was friendly but very slow.  While I understand it was busy that night, I compared her speed and efficiency against waitresses serving other tables and I'd have to say, I'd wish we were seated in a different section.

On several times she didn't show up for 15 or so minutes, either at our table or the others she was servicing.  Thankfully, the manager \"Po\" is very attentive and as he walked around the tables he would personally take our request and check on things for us.  Po really made the service experience of our visit much better.

Overall I'd rate Ohya three stars out of five.  We may go back in the future when its not so busy and if we do I'll provide an updated review."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was TERRIBLE. Men's bathroom was disgusting. Felt like a ghost the whole time."}
{"text":"Great eats great atmosphere great prices.  Place is cozy and has karaoke rooms.   Staff are polite and attentive.  Ask for Cassie, she is courteous and friendly. She knows the menu top to bottom and will make the right suggestion to suit your appetite."}
{"text":"Had the tofu soup and the ribeye bbq at the table cooktop. The tofu soup was nice. The \"beef\" couldn't be eaten by humans, unless you had a built-in chainsaw in your mouth. The pork was nice, but the beef should never have reached our table. Awful.
A smokey place (kinda fun there) that leaves you feeling like a Boy Scout just returning from a two week jamboree in the woods. Yeah, I remember that. Same thing. You might want to do laundry right after the dinner. I've been to a few Korean places in town and probably would not go back to this one. Yes, it's homey and mom and pop, but after that beef bbq attempt, uhhhhhh.....no. Not again."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, did not want to serve sushi one hour before closing, take out took forever."}
{"text":"This would be my first Yelp review and my first time trying out this restaurant. I've heard good things about OHYA and I decided to go with my sister to eat there. We love Korean food and Sushi; we were excited that OHYA served both. 

We enter the restaurant to be greeted right away and taken to our table. Our waitress brought out the water and menus within a couple minutes (maybe because it was late at night and not busy at the moment). We quickly decided on about 4 sushi rolls and the Katsu Chicken to start (we were expecting to have to order more food). After the waitress took our order, she sent it in and our food came out within 5 minutes tops! That was great because we were tired and hungry. The Katsu Chicken came out first and it wasn't the best Katsu Chicken I've had. It didn't have the crunch that most Katsus would have. I wasn't disappointed though, I still ate it happily. 

Afterwards, the sushi came out and they were decently sized portions (a lot bigger sized pieces than most sushi places we've been to) and those four rolls had us full. We ordered the California Roll, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Crab and the California Crunch. They weren't super fresh or super flavorful but they were still delicious. We even had some leftovers. We would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We were a bit concerned based on the reviews but had an excellent dinner here. It was Sat night and the service was great. We had our two small kids with us and the staff was very accommodating. The food was also great. My hubby lived in Korea for a couple of years and needed a \"fix.\" He was not disappointed. We had no sushi but went with bulgogi, another meat (which I can't remember), chap chae, & kimchi chigae. We also ordered spring rolls and chicken teriyaki for the kids.  Overall, we had fun grilling our meats and watching the kids try to use rubber banded chop sticks."}
{"text":"Oh my yumminess. The Lollipop roll has had me thinking about my first trip here for months. It was the tastiest roll I have had in a long time and definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to try something new (the roll is wrapped in cucumber rather than rice)."}
{"text":"Omg, Been wanting to go here 4-5 months ago. anways, came here on a Saturday night. they seated us right away. didnt really pay attention to the table till our food came out. NO utensils & NO napkins. hadda ask them a coupon of times. Finally when fiance finish cooking Galbi & Bulgogi. OMG the galbi smell, taste like vinegar. the waitress bought out a new one, yet it still smell.  

Customer service SUCKS!! when u pass our table atleast ask us hows our food taste since you guys been messing up with our orders. NOPE not even once. just stands there looking around. Worst ever."}
{"text":"Love this place and could eat it all day . I highly recommend this place.. The place is nicely lit and has great service! This is one of the few places you could order water to drink and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"First off, I would actually rate this place 4.5 stars, not just 4.

I don't like beating around the bush and talking about things that don't have to do with why we go to most restaurants, the FOOD!

The restaurant itself was very clean and nice.

This was my first time here, and I moved to AZ about a week ago. I went in for the lunch special, which was an awesome deal for what I got and how everything tasted. Its 4.95 Mon-Sat which is great to include Saturday.

I ordered take-out and just finished the meal. I ordered the beef bulgogi. They give a LOT of beef for the money. They included 2 side dishes. Unfortunately, they did not have the fish cake side dish, no problem though. They also ran out of california rolls which come with the meal (which is already a great deal without the rolls) so they substituted two fried dumplings which were good. I kinda wished they put the beef on a bed of white raw onions, but the cabbage was fine and the beef was really good anyway.

I also ordered a bubble tea and asked if it could be made as a milk-tea and NOT a slushie (I don't like the slushie versions that most places serve). She asked in the back and said they would do it. The drink came out tasting great and was not ridiculously over-sweetened like most places do. Overall, I will definitely be going back here to try the many other things they have on their menu. I've eaten at many korean restaurants around the country and this is a really great place."}
{"text":"First time in this one. I used to go to the Tabletop grill on Bethany but is closed now.  Had lunch. Pretty good for casual Korean food."}
{"text":"I don't really expect really good Korean food in the Peoria/Glendale area so this place actually went past my expectations. I had the bbq sampler platter that included galbi, samgyupsul, and another meat that I can't seem to remember sorry! I have nothing bad to say about the sampler except that there is not that much meat included and that the samgyupsal is kinda flavorless (except for the ample amount of pork fatty goodness).

I also had the pork kimchi pancakes which were okay, kinda flour-y tasting though. Again lacking on the flavor side but they make up for it (kinda) with a super super salty sauce on the side.

They offer boba and while I was there they were buy one get one half off. I got the green tea boba with no boba and it was okay. Nothing spectacular, I actually prefer Starbuck's green tea frap but I digress. My friend ordered the coconut and it was very watered down. So there's that. 

Overall, I would go there again. It's a fun dining experience and nothing beats grilling some fresh meat with some great company."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here, they have a great lunch special at a cheap price. Also there are a lot of non-Asians that go here, so don't be intimidated if you aren't Korean."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better, if not, the best Korean restaurant in the area. So why the 1 star? BECAUSE THEY WILL TRY TO RIP YOU OFF IF YOU DON'T HAVE A KEEN EYE. The server tried to sneak gratuity on the bill. Understandably, there is an automatic gratuity when there is a party of 5 or more but I only had a party of 3. Initially, an itemized receipt was brought over, which the total bill was ~$42; however, when I received the credit card slip that needed to be signed it magically increased to over $49. When I requested the itemized receipt again, I could see the server's discomfort. The new itemized receipt that was then brought over had the line item 'Gratuity' with a $7+ charge added to the bill. When I brought this to the attention of our server, she said sorry but was probably only sorry because she was caught. Who knows how many times I have been duped at this place prior or how many other people have been improperly charged. Definitely keep an eye on your itemized receipt and reconcile it with your charge slip!"}
{"text":"When arriving seating took forever, we called in advance and still had to wait 30-40 mins for a table. Service was horribly exucuted and the servers were too frantic to get our order correct. We were charged for food that we didn't order and management didn't do anything to tend to our concerns."}
{"text":"I'm a recent transplant to the Glendale area, and was anxious to try this establishment.  It absolutely did NOT disappoint.

I lived in S. Korea for two years, and miss the food like crazy.  But not just the food--the feel, the service, the Korea-ness of dining out in Korea.  I went in today for lunch, and it was like I had found a secret portal back to the awesome restaurant in my apartment building in Seoul.  The way the restaurant is laid out, the K-pop on the speakers, MBC on the TV--it's as authentic as you can find in the US.

The food.  I had the dol-sot (hot stone pot) galbi (pig rib) bi-bim-bap (mixed rice) and it was excellent.  The side dishes were regular kimchi, bean sprout kimchi, cucumber kimchi, and pickled radish.  I wish the kimchis had been spicier, but I imagine they're simplified a bit for American audiences.

I'll update my review after I get a chance to have the BBQ.  $8 for samgyeopsol M-Thurs nights is a pretty good deal here in the states, and I'm excited to check that out."}
{"text":"Went on Tuesday for all you can eat Sushi. Was very good and the service was amazing as well. Be aware it takes a bit to get your food on Tuesdays cause it's packed. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was good overall. The Jap Chae was a little watery. The Cucumbers were really good.  The grill takes a really long time to cook your food. It started to finally get hot enough when we were almost done. Since we don't have too many options in the West Valley, I'll be back. Next time I'll have them cook it for us."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and sushi is my favorite food, especially late night. So when I looked on yelp and found ohya to be open until 2am I didn't hesitate. I arrived at 1am WELL BEFORE CLOSING TIME, and upon my entry I was told that they were closed and not serving food or drinks anymore. The neon sign in the window said open, their hours posted on the front door said they were open, along with yelp. I kindly told them all 3 of these things were indicated they could do business but they just shrugged and said sorry....OHYA? OHNO!! NEVER GO HERE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A RESTAURANT THAT STANDS BY WHAT THEY SAY !! LAZY, UNPROFESSIONAL, and UNCALLED FOR!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the $10 for $20 deal on Groupon, and this review is based entirely on the sushi and service. I did not try any of the Korean BBQ dishes, and will not be returning to try them in the future.

Good:
- The nigiri salad was good-ish...the grab bag selection of raw fish diced was generally good and most were tasty and chilled.

Bad
-The nigiri salad had an awful, sugary dressing already mixed in that wasn't listed on the menu
-We ordered the nigiri combo with the spicy tuna roll, yellowtail nigiri, and eel nigiri. None of the fish was any cooler than room temperature, as if they just store raw fish in the back on a counter; it did not taste fresh (which is odd considering the fish in the salad DID...). The waitress also did not bring out the spicy tuna roll until we were nearly finished and then asked if we still wanted it.
-Service was not good. We saw our waitress once to order, again to bring out the sushi, and then she ignored us. I tried to get her attention to get the rest of our order and more water, but she didn't stop by again for some time and never once asked how the food was. There appeared to be three waitresses working, and the place was deserted except for one table of two and one table of two women and a child running around barefoot. Someone who may or may not have worked there was dressed in gym shorts and a t-shirt and kept wandering around an in/out of the kitchen. No idea if he worked there, so we didn't ask him. Getting our check was painful, and we didn't wait for her to return and just gave the first employee who walked by our card. Didn't see her again and we left after paying some random employee.

Not worth it, even with the Groupon deal. I don't like wondering if I'm going to get food poisoning after leaving a restaurant and the service was terrible."}
{"text":"We are in town for the week and came onto yelp looking for places to eat for dinner. We decided to find some good korean restaurants. We were originally planning on going to Seoul Jung but called and the number was out of service and 411 said no restaurant existed. I believe they are out of business. So we went searching for another korean restaurant and this restaurant had good reviews. We also checked out the menu as well and decided to give this place a try, even though it was 20 miles away where we're staying, we're glad we came!

We were debating between doing BBQ style or ordering individually. We decided to go individual. We ordered the Kimchi Chigae, Galbi Dolsot Bibimbap, and Daeji Bulgogi Soft Tofu Combo [got the Seafood Soft Tofu], and OB to drink. The ahjumma brought out some salad to eat, which was lightly marinated with some sesame oil and soy sauce. And then our banchan's came out. The banchan was pretty good, but we've had better banchans in cali. [To True L: there are refills the banchans. just ask her for more.]

The Galbi Dolsot Bibimbap came out first and it looked really good. My Mr loved how it tasted. We've had bibimbap at many korean restaurants in socal, and he thought this one was the best he's tasted. My Daeji Bulgogi combo came out next, and the Bulgogi was very nicely marinated. That was very good and not dry at all. The Seafood Soft Tofu was ok, but the seafood taste and scent was a little too strong for me. My sister got the Kimchi chigae, and she loved it, so did the Mr. The Kimchi Chigae soup was nicely balanced between the spicyness and sourness. I think a little spicier would've been great as well! 

They open till 10pm which seems to be pretty late for Arizona. Thank you to fellow yelpers for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"I will always go back to Ohya because it's one of the few places in the entire valley that has Korean Soju! Loved that since day 1.
I've been a regular customer since its remodel a couple years back I got to say I'm kind of tired of how often they change their menu and their prices. Even when you use a Groupon it seems very expensive. 
I had an uncomfortable experience with one of their servers once. I asked for a refill on my water and she said with a serious face \"No!\" I looked at her surprised and then she say \"just kidding\"....honestly I still don't know how to interpret that situation. 
They have so many servers changing all the time I never see the same ones. For example, one time a server honored our Groupon for happy hour sushi. Next time a different server said they could not honor Groupon on happy hour sushi. And the third time we went we saw the sushi menu say \"No discounts or coupons with happy hour sushi\"
So which one is which? First they say yes then it's a no. 
I wish they had a Groupon for their korean food and not only for sushi."}
{"text":"We came here at 4 pm. We are the only customers that time. My wife ordered a combo 2. She loves it!! The meat is fresh and tasty. She said I must give a 5 star for this delicious food.
This restaurant is also generous refilling the small kimchi dishes. It's really a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Very poor service! I waited 5 minutes just to get my drink. And they didn't give us any menus when the server sat us. I had to ask another waitress for menus. After that she took our sushi order before we ordered our actual meals and it took 35 for three sushi rolls! They never bothered to tell us why we were waiting so long or when it'd be coming out. And the two groups who came in 20 minutes after we'd been sat got their food out before because they knew the manager. It was horrible. Didn't bother staying for the sushi. My friends and I bought our drinks only and left. We've been here many times before but lately it's been going down. Don't what it is but never coming again."}
{"text":"I love coming to ohya for the food & familiar faces at the sushi bar. I haven't always had the best service from the waitresses but tonight the new server ALEX was amazing. She checked in on us often & the edamame came out before my sushi for the first time. Thanks for a great evening Alex!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times but lately the quality and flavor  of the food has deteriorated. I may have to find a new korean restaurant to go to"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, the staff is so plesent and friendly. Everytime i come in the place is always busy. The food is amazing i take new peoplr here eveytime they are in town."}
{"text":"The service here was really slow!!!!!! Also the portions are very small, it was a little hard to read the menu because it was a little dark inside. In summary, probably will not go back, but the food was not bad at all."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean restaurant in the west valley. I'm a long term valley resident, and have been a fan of CGJ Korean BBQ and Pho Avina since their beginnings at the shopping center across from ASU West.

I've tried the other Korean restaurants on the west side (Takamatsu, Seoul Korean Grill) and don't think they compare. I love the tofu soups, the bibimbap, and side dishes (my favorites are the lotus root--when they have them, and the sweet potato salad). I also like the fact that this is a small, intimate family run establishment as I prefer mom & pop restaurants to generic chains.

I would recommend getting a normal menu entree as opposed to the lunch specials on your first visit. The lunch specials are priced cheap for a reason, and don't give you a good idea of the quality & flavor of real Korean food, plus you don't get the delicious side dishes."}
{"text":"My first experience was not a good one here. But because my friends wanted to go here for dinner another time, I gave it another go. And I have to say, I feel bad about my previous review. I just want to say personally, I don't think I would order the Soup combo with the ribs again, but their other FOOD IS FANTASTIC (at least JJAJANGMYUN and JJAMPONG N5) were! And I looked around and their sushi seems to be quite good too! I'm glad I gave it another try."}
{"text":"Went to Pho Avina (which I could easily recommend to anyone) a few weeks ago with my 2nd dad and he spies the Korean BBQ place (note their signage all says Korean BBQ and not Chuhgajib) and he grabs a menu and we make note to ourselves to check it out (of course, not until after I checked out the other reviews on Yelp)

So we head there for lunch today.

Now, I know this about Korean food...I ate kimchi made by the mother of one of my daughters friends and it was good. Beyond that, I know that when I flip on LPGA on television to watch the hottee Paula Creamer, some Korean chick is depriving her of a victory and I am none too pleased but it does appear that they understand food...but I digress.

Lunch specials $ 4.95 - OK...I'm suspicious. Includes 3 pieces of california roll, salad, rice, vegetable and entree. Too cheap. 

We order gyoza and egg roll appetizers. Evidently gyoza in Korean restaurant is different than Chinese restaurant but is scrumptious nonetheless. Egg rolls more typical to my expectations and very tasty - I'm optimistic. Tea is in big weird cup with no handle and waaay too hot to actually pick up but tea bag says Liptons...I'm still suspicious.

Salad, underwhelming but I am impressed with silver chopsticks that work well for me.

Comes the lunch platter...
- California Rolls, AOK 
- big mound of white rice, perfect
- pickled vegables, tasty and interesting
- sweet/sour vegetables, tasty and interesting...wishing someone could tell me what it was I was eating but hey, it's all good.
- meat (I had bbq pork but forget the name) mildly spiced, nice, a little dry but that may have been intentional...my knowledge of Korean clearly fails me here. 2nd dad got bbq beef and it was very tasty, not spicy, much more moist.

We left stuffed, happy amazed that lunch could be so good and so cheap.

Place was packed and it's obvious why. Inexpensive, tasty, no disappointments and very clean.

Woman who ran the restaurant wears sneakers and reminded me of a track star because she handled a packed restaurant but hardly seemed to work up a sweat and handled a bunch of to go orders as well.

I have to say...49th Avenue and Thunderbird, two excellent Asian restaurants practically side by side and you can't go wrong at either place.

You can gorge yourself for $10 here. You could drink water and have a $6 lunch that puts a Big Mac to shame."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Ohya on February 16, 2018 and she had an allergic reaction the following day. Not sure if it was just a coincidence but I wanted to ask if anyone else had a similar experience after dinning there."}
{"text":"My favorite korean bbq place. I live right around the corner from this place and the food is spot on. after climbing all day at the rock gym, theres nothing like relaxing with a stone bowl of good food. the gaibi is soo good i just want to eat a plate of it. But seriously, try the Gaibi. its HEAVEN!"}
{"text":"Lier place ....... Food was 5star. Sever was bad !!!!      When my friend pay the bill a young girl sever didn't bring the receipt for him and tell him $179.35 bill no include tips.  So. When he tell us  bill was $179.35  so we ask the receipt .20% gratuity without any explanation....     Why you sever can  lie customers???????????????      No sever tell us karaoke have gratuity. !! Less you guys need write on the menu  right. ???   Old sever was so mad at us .... And being rude .... We will not comeback !!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. This was the first place I went to for a taste of Korean food, which I had dearly missed since returning from there in September 2K11. I had told my girlfriend that she would love the food and I would treat her. We both had the dol sot bi bim bap as well as the man du guk with sliced rice cake (oh and if you read my review on Cafe Ga Hyang, you'll notice it's pretty much the same meal). I felt that the Kim Chi as well as the red pepper sauce were spicier than Cafe Ga Hyang and they also offer the option to BBQ your own choice of meat unlike Cafe Ga Hyang. If you haven't tried Korean before or if it has been a long time since you've had it I suggest you give this place a try. I know I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"If your Korean don't bother. If not it is a sad representation. There palate has long since expired, like their kimchee! OMG! How can a respectable Korean place serve a fellow Korean who spoke to them in their native tongue severely over the hill kimchee. OLD kimchee, our STAPLE in any Korean restaurant means crappy food.   Also horrible service. This hole in the wall should be walled up."}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst food quality and service I have ever gotten. I ordered the seafood stew and seafood pancake. Actually It was a groupon deal $22 for 2 entree with 1 appetizer up to 68% off value. However, there was nothing worth over $14 entree. It's basically a full price for what you get from Groupon without any deal. The worst part is the food quality. In the seafood stew, there was not much seafood except few crab legs. I want negative star rating but it is not possible, so I'm giving one star."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday randomly, looking to try out the BBQ with my gal and luckily we came on the special all-you-can-eat Tuesday, for a affordable price we can have all the sushi and BBQ we can have in 90 minutes which was the catch haha. 

Everything was delicious, the Vegas and Temptation Roll was my favorite and the spicy marinated beef was my fav! I also had a slushy mango something vodka, and it was yummy! 

Our server was Kelly I believe and she was very fast and attentive, loved her! She was there all night on her feet and still gave excellent service!"}
{"text":"Just left Ohya and we had a party of 12.  There were 5 adults and 7 kids. We went for Korean BBQ and sushi. Waitress sat us at the table with two broken grill table tops. She moved us to another table with one broken grill table top. We got 6 waters for 12 of us. Waitress took our order and then walked away but we still needed to order more. How are we supposed to cook Korean BBQ with broken grill tops and feed these kids. Ohya is not able to accommodate to a big party. Horrible customer service, will not go again. Maybe if you have a party of 2 you will be able to eat. Never again! 
0 stars!!!"}
{"text":"This place is usually busy and there's probably only 1-3 servers working so waiting can take awhile. Which is probably why I'm giving it 4 stars. Other than that, the kbbq is pretty good. My gf got the teriyaki chicken, which is probably one of the best one I have had. They usually have AYCE kbbq, but it's selective on odd days of the week. $20 for kbbq and $25 for sushi and kbbq. The next one is April 18 & 28. They have karaoke rooms and all day $5 sake bombers! You can't really beat that. If the service was faster this place would definitely get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I visit this restaurant with the same friend.  We get the same waitress and order the exact same thing: bulgogi and katsu, house selection of sides and Korean beer.  That's how I like it and I leave happy every time.

If you're a fan of sliced beef and breaded pork then order the above selections or find your favorite Korean dish.  The menu offers a wide variety of selections.

They serve at least 2 Korean beers (OB & Cass) and they're both worth trying out and each goes well with the food.

Just be aware of the booths in the center aisle.  The faux word/stone benches have these holes in them by design and it feels awkward if you end up sitting on one.  If you're going with an annoying friend or family member...make sure that's where they sit."}
{"text":"We loved the food.  It was delicious!  But the price of the Korean BBQ Grill seems a little pricey...at least from the last time I had it which has been awhile.  Sushi plates were presented very well but it took so long for them to get it to us.  The staff were nice but service was kind of slow.  You have to be aggressive and wave your hand high to get their attention.

We will be returning to this place as the food were very good, but we will have to time it and make sure not to go during busy hours...which is lunch time and dinner time."}
{"text":"This place is great! Their recent remodel really improved the atmosphere. I recommend the kimchi chigae or bulgogi and tofu soup combo. Both are fantastic. I also recently tried their sushi and that didn't disappoint either. Overall, they have great food, friendly service, and fair pricing. If you're in the area, I highly recommend giving Ohya a try."}
{"text":"Fun environment, chill location, Korean BBQ is the bomb. Waiters were friendly and helpful, Simon was amazing, one of the best waiters I've ever experienced!!! Highly recommend coming here with a party of 4 for a great night or even bring your date, he or she will love it and you'll be able to show off your cooking skills."}
{"text":"Lunch today found me in major exploratory mode. I decided for no reason in particular that I wanted Korean food. Now, working where I work, this took some sleuthing, but then I found a potential target, Chuhgajib, and decided to head out that way.

I then asked two of my colleagues if they wanted to join me.

They're vegetarians.

Vegetarians in a Korean restaurant? This might be problematic, but I told them, \"Uh, sure! There'll be lots of things for you to eat!\" I think I sounded convincing, because they still came with me.

So we head out towards one of the many stripmalls that Glendale is blessed with and enter the joint. Packed with a lunch crowd, including many Korean people (a real good sign), we had around a 10 minute wait before being seated at a giant teakish table. I ordered the bulgogi (thinly sliced marinated bbq beef) lunch special, while my veggie cohorts got the bi bim bap (a rice dish with topped with sauteed and seasoned veggies) and the veggie yakisoba (not so Korean, but at least he could eat it). As we waited, we were given regular bowls of salad and then several bowls of banchan (Korean side dishes) - pickled radishes, random assortment of seaweed, bean sprouts, potatoes, sliced marinated lotus root, and of course, kimchi (spicy fermented cabbage).  

I looked at my colleagues, who never had Korean food before, nervously, but to my surprise, they both took a good liking to the kimchi, enough so that it disappeared long before our entrees even got there. The rest of the banchan was good, and I noticed that the tables were equipped for folks to grill at their own table if they chose to. Given it was lunch and most folks were in a hurry, no one was grilling, except one table which used it to heat up their broth of something or another. 

Eventually our entrees came to us, and honestly, the two veggie dishes looked awesome, especially the bi bim bap, which came in its own hot stone pot filled to the top with good stuff. The yakisoba looked great, too. My bulgogi looked kind of sad in comparison, just a bunch of shredded beef on a plate with three California rolls (?), but it still tasted great. 

The service was very acommodating towards my vegetarian colleagues and the hostess/owner was very interested if they enjoyed their meal (they did quite a bit - although they faltered with and soon gave up on using the stainless steel chopsticks). We then ended with dessert - bowls of sikhye (a chilled sweet rice soup) which made for a refreshing end to our lunch. 

To close, you get for $10 (including tax & tip) a feast fit for a king. I'd definitely like to come back with a few carnivorous friends for a full-on Korean bbq dinner sometime (I'll save star #5 until then), but until then I'm satisfied that another great lunch option has been found on this here west side of town. 

4 solid stars."}
{"text":"I'll preempt this review by stating that I have no concept of what authentic Korean food tastes like.  I've had a few home-cooked meals, but when it comes to Korean restaurants, my exposure is limited to Chuhgajib Korean BBQ and Takamatsu.  I personally don't care too much about food's authenticity, for me taste reigns supreme.  For example, I prefer artificial strawberry flavoring, but hate actual strawberries.

That being said, I'm not well-traveled enough to tell you how authentic the food is.  All I can tell you is that it's always been a good experience and the food is very tasty.

The atmosphere and staff are welcoming.  Some tables feature built-in grills so you can cook the meat at your table (it's fun once, but I'll let the cooks handle it next time).  As a former waiter, I would cringe if I had to babysit some guy trying to impress a girl by using the table-top grill.  But, on a recent date, the staff was more than helpful with doing just that.  Despite my best efforts I had a hard time finding the sweet spot between thinly sliced raw meat and charred ash, and I have a feeling other restaurants might have been less appreciative of me smoking up the place. :)  As a tragically un-hip white guy, I've been to a lot of ethnic restaurants where I've felt uncomfortable for being unfamiliar with the cuisine or customs of that region, and I never felt that way here.

Like most Korean places, every meal is kicked off with a slew of mini appetizers, which I believe is called banchan. Some are fantastic, some are ok, and some I could skip out on (I'm not a fan of kimchi so I can't tell you if it's any good), but it's free so at the very least you can get a lot of different tastes even if you only order one item.

As for the meals, I just stick to BBQ dishes.  The spicy bulgogi is my favorite, the meat tastes like it's infused with the seasoning, and it's got just he right amount of kick.  The regular bulgogi and the chicken are also good choices for your first visit, and they have a few combo deals so you can try different meats.  Avoid the pork, it was practically inedible, very chewy and fatty.

One last note:  The boba drinks are ok, but consider getting one afterwards at Pho Avina next door, they have more flavors, warmed-up boba \"balls\", and the sealed cups you have to stab with your straw.

Other reviewers seem to think that the only reason this place is getting good reviews is that those reviewers have a limited perspective on Korean food, and that there aren't many options in Phoenix.  That might be true, but my guess is you wouldn't be reading this if you lived anywhere else, and if that's the case then your Korean food exposure is likely similar to mine and so are your options.  I'm sure there's better places out there, but you'd likely have to board a plane to find one."}
{"text":"Super fun for a date night. The wings are to die for! A little expensive, but nice to try once a year."}
{"text":"First time having korean bbq, yum! You can cook it yourself, which is super fun, or have them cook it for you. Love the happy hour! Great friendly service, every time."}
{"text":"Party of 5 charged 18% for tip for a waitress we hardly seen. We did the cook yourself BBQ which was good. We had the black bean sauce noodles not much flavor and the noodles were kinda MEH. The spicy pork is always the winner.  Spicy tuna sushi yah um not ordering again the rice overcooked. The side dishes were okay. When you order the soup make sure to get extra rice. They did renovate and added the sushi bar. Almost miss the way it was before. The servers are all different younger crowd. Not trashy dressed but younger I miss the older Korean waitress she rocked"}
{"text":"A good all around sushi place. I had four different rolls, including the California crunch, spider, Tootsie, and something else. All were great except the spider roll tasted a little funny. My wife had the seafood soup. It was delicious. This place is a little pricy for sushi, but is made a little cheaper with the Groupon."}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO EAT HERE. 
I wasn't expecting the food to be that good but YALL it's that good. Highly recommend the gyoza! The dipping sauce is made of pure deliciousness."}
{"text":"We came here again with a party of 10 and I was surprised about the improvements! The server we had was amazing! This gentleman really took pride in his job and made sure we were well taken care of. We ordered way more than we could finish and didn't bother cooking it ourselves this time. I think this is the way to go whenever you come here. It saves time and we didn't have to worry about our gas running out, needing more butter, etc."}
{"text":"We love the food at this place. 

Caveat: sometimes service isn't that good unless you get a specific server. I can't remember her name but she's usually always there. 

It's not always super clean. The tables and chairs are sticky about 50% of the time. 

However, I will go to a place more than once if we like the food. 

Sushi: standard sushi. Nothing exceptional, we normally don't get sushi here. 

Kbbq: Jumuluk-thick slices of beef seasoned with salt, pepper and sesame oil. This is one of my favorites. It's usually served with sesame oil that has s&p in it. 

Bulgogi: marinated thinly sliced beef cooked & served over raw white onions



Noodles: Japchae-clear noodles seasoned with sesame oil, with stir fried veggies (usually carrots, mushrooms green onions) and bulgogi. Don't skip this!

Ramen: the broth has good umami, the noodles are cooked well, it's just a little salty for my taste"}
{"text":"UPDATING THE REVIEW AS OF 12/30/2016 - FROM 5 STARS TO 2 STARS:

We have been visiting this restaurant for more than 8 years, before their name changed to Ohya.  This place is no longer the same ever since the Scottsdale location is opened, because the owner, Chris stops visiting this location.

This restaurant at Glendale has been going downhill for more than 2 months.  We thought we would see improvement but so far it's only getting worse.  Their Korean BBQ meat is no longer fresh.  Cups and plates are often dirty as if they are not washed at all.  There is also a supply shortage issue as if they no longer keep their inventories checked.  It looks like Chris is about to abandon this restaurant, so time for us to find a new Korean/Japanese restaurants nearby.

I have also removed some of the photos I posted on yelp, as the foods do not look the same anymore, or no longer available.

End of update.


*This review is for hardcore foodie who is not bound to Americanized-Asian food.

I have tried this restaurant numerous times and I must say I am usually quite satisfied in terms of the value, ingredients' freshness and food varieties. 

What I like:

Ingredients - Fresh raw seafood consistently.  I haven't been disappointed so far.  This is one of a few places that actually serves fresh sweet shrimps (raw shrimps) and do it right.

Skewers - They are awesome (in most cases, not always, see below).  Beef tongues and chicken gizzards are my favorites.

Service -  Never have problems, friendly and efficient.

Happy Hour menu all day everyday!!!! - Do I need to say more? ;)

What I don't like:

Preparations - It seems like they recently got a new sushi chef that's still in training.  The preparation and the cutting skill will require significant improvement.  Therefore, even when the ingredients are still fresh, the meat tastes like \"dead meat\" for those who know what I mean.

Skewers - They used to be cook-to-order, which takes a long time and it's understandable.  I suspect the skewers are now pre-cooked in order to achieve faster serving time.

Overall, I will still keep going there on a weekly basis!!"}
{"text":"So we stumbled on this place for the fact that they were open late on a week night. To our surprise the restaurant was packed at 9PM. Our server Jade was very sweet and helpful. We came on a \"all you can eat special\" night that they have the second and fourth Tuesday of the month. We opted for the KBBQ & Sudhi for $24.95 and WOW what a great deal and experience. Everything we had was fantastic. My favorite was the ribeye. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try after the owner reached out to me following my last review. Although the wait for food the last 2 times has been longer than average, 15 minutes for a dynamite roll for example, i still i put up with it because it's the only Korean bbq within a 30 mile radius of where i live.  

Unfortunately, today was the last straw. I went in for lunch, ordered 2 salmon nigiri, I even checked it on her sheet which she said was not necessary because she has great memory, although when it came out it was a salmon roll. I also ordered a bulgogi bento box as well as a dynamite roll. When the bulgogi bento box came out I took one bite of the meat and it was cold. Whatever happened to fresh food?

Sorry,  you lost a customer today."}
{"text":"I went to CGB to other day with a group of people for the summer lunch special, which was excellently priced. They even had deals such as buy 1 get 1 50% off on boba drinks and appetizers!
The service was good. Although I believe there's only one person in the kitchen, so everything came out a little slow. Luckily, there was only one other table during the time we were there.
I got the bulgogi bento box, and the portion size was filling. The bulgogi itself was pretty good. The only gripe I had about it was that it seemed a little grainy. 

Overall, I'd probably go back here again. For the price and the quality, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"I had a date here last night, I am huge korean food fan. I actually introduced my friend/fellow food adventurer to it in the first place (see my last review) When we went to hodori. I will compare Chuhgajib now.

Ambience: About the same as Hodori. Did have more interesting furniture as they has these huge natural wood booth thingies...they also had table top grills which we didn't use because I was feeling lazy.

Service: The server was friendly and attentive without being hovery... This is what I prefer Only things I notice is... she didn't refil lany banchans ( i dont know if that is policy?) and We didn't get a check..we had to just walk up to the register ( again don't know if thats the norm here)

Food:We ordered the T 11 ( I believe) Bulgogi and soft tofu soup (we got the combo with squid mussels etc) my date didn't care for soup. I liked it alot aside from the squid ( which is just me) We ordered it regular spicy and it was fine for my wimpy self.I love how it comes out boiling. The bulgogi was excellent I prefer it to hodori was not dry and the flavor was good. We split one combo because we are both very light eaters.All the sides were good except the potato was either underdone or old. I think the portions are smaller here in general than Hodori as far as meet goes(which is perfect for us). The wine was the only let down. We expected the some milky-served in a bowl-with a ladel- goodness and we got a sealed commercial bottle. The wine itself was fine and a bit stronger than the wine at Hodori but I prefer the wine at Hodori. I like presentation. So In short i would say, the food is better at Chuhgajib( and a little cheaper) than Hodori but the win was not as good.
I will be frequently both these spots for their relative strengths.

SPECIAL NOTE: there is no Chuhgajib sign... its in the strip mall and just has a korean BBQ sign."}
{"text":"The food was yummy, but I don't know if that was because I was starving waiting for everything. Service was soooo incredibly slow. It took forever to get seated. And it took forever for someone to come take our order-we were about to walk out. And then the food took awhile to arrive also. They gave us a little amount of rice. Our waters our empty and I wonder when they are going to come get our payment.  Better not be in a hurry or have other plans cause this place has the slowest service ever."}
{"text":"great fusion of japanese and korean culture! great to see the atmosphere match the aesthetically pleasing staff and surroundings."}
{"text":"Whenever I read Yelp reviews for non-American cuisine, I want to know a little something about the reviewer in order to gauge how much weight to give the review.  So first, about me...I am a 1.5 generation Korean-American dad married to a 1st generation Korean woman who travels with two little girls (3 and 6 y/o) who always need at least one Korean meal a day.  TRANSLATION: I think I know a little something about authentic and/or tasty Korean food.

We happened to be traveling to the north end of PHX once last month and thought we would try this restaurant for dinner.  BIG MISTAKE.

Our biggest complaint is that the meals were too salty.  We had orders of ribs, bibim bap, and mushroom soon tofu.  Everything was TOO SALTY.  We got the soon tofu soup for the girls in the white (non-spicy) form.  A non-spicy format inherently makes it less salty, but my wife had to dilute it 1:1 (yes, equal volumes) with water to make it palatable.  We thought it might have been a fluke, but both the bibimbap and ribs were also too salty.  Our next complaint was that the service was very spotty.  Like in the Verizon commercial, we were wondering if any of the staff were there or could hear us.  This became an issue and was noticeable as we frequently needed more water and white rice (to eat the salty meal).  

THE GOOD.  We wondered why this place has received such high marks on Yelp.  We came up with 3 possibilities.  FIrst, price.  Their menu consists of many combo items (ie. ribs/soon tofu) which come with smaller portions and lower prices.  Second and third, lack of Korean restaurants in the area in association with patrons that want to experience some form of Korean food and don't know that they could do much better."}
{"text":"I just had it for lunch: for about $20 I got a seaweed salad ( somewhat tasteless), and sushi from all day HH menu: spicy scallop( quite disgusting) and Caterpillar ( liked it). 
Nah, wont come back"}
{"text":"I had dinner at this place for a friend's birthday get together.  I always wondered about it while eating at Pho Avina next door a few times.  This is the third time I have ever eaten at a Korean restaurant and I it felt authentic.  From the wooden benches and tabletops to the lightly decorated pieces of art and plants, it felt like a mom and pops' place. The front signage CHK light was either off or not working.

I ordered Nakji Bokum mild.  It is a stir-fried octopus veggie dish.  It came on a sizzling platter and although the veggie assortment (mostly jalapenos and onions) were a disappointment, I loved the octopus.  The white rice was served in a personal-sized metal bowl, which was unusual.  It was really spicy, beyond what I could take, but downing a few glasses of lemon ice water quickly restored the flavors.

Complimentary sides (spicy cabbage, regular cabbage, broccoli, lotus root in heavy syrup, yams) and were always refreshed and the waitress was accommodating.

I give it a notch lower because of the higher price tag and apparently, mild means a bit on the spicy side for them.  Korean food is not my thing, but this place is good for Korean food enthusiasts."}
{"text":"Got to try CJB today and man I'm a happy camper. We bought a deal of buywithme.com where we paid $15 for a $30 certificate. It's great because we normally to to Korean BBQ in Mesa, but this place is now my new favorite. We started with an order of the Gyoza (4.95) They were lightly fried, crispy and just perfect. Paired that with a large Korean OB Beer ($6). We decided to go with BBQ combo #1 that came with bulgogi, daeji bulgugi (somewhat spicy pork) and Dalk Gui (grilled chicken). These are actually the three things we usually get, so it worked perfect. The combo was $30 and easily enough for 3-4 people, with the panchak (mixed side dishes) and rice. The bulgogi was awesome, super thin and great flavor. The Dalk Gui was pretty good, just seasoned chicken. The piece de la resistance was absofrigginlutely the Daeji Bulgogi. Now this is always my fave Korean BBQ dish, but this ranks up with the best I've ever had. While it did lack some of the heat of other Daeji dishes I've had, it made up for it in flavor and just overall awesomeness. The grill they had there was unlike anyone i'd seen, it was better when I had them crank up the heat and let it warm up for a bit. it was this odd round grill thing, but definitely did the trick. We finished the meal with a Coconut boba. All total, using the coupon we ended up dropping a whopping $28 with tip. Even without the tip, it still would have been a hair over $40 which is great. Killer service, great atmosphere and rockin food. Great to have a new fave Korean BBQ spot in the valley"}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a visit to this place and boy was it a treat! 

I ordered the K8 - Saeng SaeWoo Gui - Shrimp and vegetables and he ordered the K4 - Daeji Bulgogi - spicy pork. Both were the 'BBQ at your own table' type.  

The aroma of the shrimp and the zucchini roasting in the sauce and changing colors really whets your appetite. The food was light, delicious and just the right quantity without making you feel like heavy. I ordered the Hazelnut coffee with boba. The drink itself was yummy but I didn't care too much for the boba.

The seating I would say is a little tight but the food and service are excellent. Very well priced too. And I got to enjoy some Korean TV drama as well :)

We're definitely going back to try a few more dishes!"}
{"text":"This place was great!! As soon as you step in through the door you get indulged by all the wonderful BBQ smells and you also hear how others' in their table are cooking up their own meats and veggies!! What a great little spot it is!! I highly recommend it to all those BBQ lovers and Panda express fans!! This is much better and healthier too!! 
It was a good full that we got after consuming all our food and not a fatty full!!"}
{"text":"4 words: can't stop won't stop.

This hidden gem will change your life. Awesome atmosphere, awesome servers, awesome music, we always BBQ our food and the Soju is legit. If you have group, rent out the Karaoke room."}
{"text":"I was here the other day with my family and our sushi took FOREVER to come. Turns out the sushi chef was on his phone texting instead of making sushi! Came in today again and thank god another sushi chef was working and our order was fast this time. While we were eating, there was an old asian guy yelling in the back. Not a good environment to bring kids."}
{"text":"The manager is super nice. He gave me a margarita for free. I had a dragon roll that literally looked like a dragon.  Also I had side dishes dicon and macaroni salad because I'm allergic to the spicy sides. They were very aware of my allergy. I definitely recommend oh ya."}
{"text":"I'm Korean and grew up in San Diego with access to some of the most authentic dishes in Cali. My hubby suggested we try this place. Quite the snob and skeptic I did with my kiddos. Man it was delicious! From soup to BBQ very authentic and quality food/meat. A must try!"}
{"text":"I'm so torn about writing this update. I've been to this place more times than I can count in the last few years and I would even say we were friendly with the owners. The food was always good. That being said, I doubt I will ever go back.

Our party of 3 (and a baby) were seated and ordered quickly. My two companions had the meat/sushi combo for $15. One got Bulgogi and Nigiri and my husband got the Salmon Teriyaki and Crispy Tuna Roll. I ordered the small Sashimi plate ($20). For the kiddo, we got the Bulgogi bowl ($6). 

I will say that the side dishes were good and we do love the kimchi. The Bulgogi came out first for my friend. It didn't come with rice but he liked it. My husband's Salmon came out next and it was the smallest piece of fish I have ever seen... Maybe 2 oz worth. He had to order a side of rice with it for $1. The baby's Bulgogi and rice bowl had more food than my friend's dish, which was weird. We had about 3 servings of the side dishes. The kimchi was good but the potatoes were flaked with ice.

45 min into the meal, we still didn't have any sushi. I mentioned it to the waitress and she said the Sushi Chef was backed up. A few
minutes later, the manager/owner came out - presumably to help. I watched him watch football for a good 10 min before helping the Sushi Chef, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt in case there was something out of his control.

A good 10 min later, my friend got his 6 pieces of Nigiri. The only saving grace was that he did like it. A few minutes later, my husband got his roll.

At this point, everyone had been given their food but me and let's face it - a Sashimi dish  doesn't need to be cooked so almost an hour to deliver seems ridiculous.

The fish was fresh but I was unhappy. I had a $20 LivingSocial deal that I had paid about $10 on so that was deducted from the bill. We asked for boxes and the bill about 3 times before we got it. I'm not sure why - there were a few tables but there appeared to be at least 2 waitresses and a hostess.

When I looked down at the bill, it was not ours. In retrospect, it was only $28 so I should have just paid it. I brought it up to the waitress and she gave me the correct bill - $48 - WITH the $20 discount from my $10 coupon. I mentioned that I was a long time customer and that I was disappointed that the manager didn't even offer an apology or a comp - even on something small like the kids' meal. She said the manager told her no  more discount because we had a coupon.

At that point, I told the manager that I was very disappointed and had a very bad experience that night. He IGNORED me. He didn't even apologize.

I sat and waited for another 10 min for the waitress to pick up my money and to provide change. She never came so I found some smaller bills and left her a tip. I don't blame her for everything, but I was still unhappy.

After so many good experiences here, I am torn about giving this review because of one really bad experience. It would have been so easy to make this right. A heartfelt apology and acknowledgement from the manager would have sufficed as would an apology and a small comp. We got nothing after years of supporting this business. I feel like my business obviously doesn't matter to this establishment and I can't go back after this for a long time - maybe ever.

I know restaurants and people have bad or off days. I get it. We're all human. But, come on, make an effort!"}
{"text":"Whomp Whomp... We came tonight so hungry and looking forward to the cabbage salad along with our usual meats. There was some confusion when the salad came out since it was NOT what we got the last 3 times we were there. The cabbage salad we had last time was large, with fresh, crisp cabbage and a light dressing. The one that got brought out to us looked like somebody's leftovers. It was 1/4 of the size we got last time, and it wasn't crispy and airy, it was damp and drenched in dressing. After saying something to the waitress she said \"oh yeah, it does look a lot smaller than usual! Oh well!\" and went along her way...Very disappointing. The meats were good per usual. We have to drive about 45 min to get to this place, so I'm not sure but this might be our last visit because how disappointed we were... :(."}
{"text":"There are two separate prices for sushi-- one was way more expensive and another was the \"all day happy hour\"-- not to be used with any groupons or coupons. The waitress confirmed that these are the exact same rolls, they are just letting you know blatantly that they are overpricing for their \"promotions\". They weren't even smart enough to have the two differently priced menus separated. With the restrictions, it ended up being a pretty bad deal so we cancelled our groupon. As others have mentioned, the service was not great, despite many servers and only a few other customers. Food was ok."}
{"text":"What an experience!...this had to have been one of the most filling, out-of-the-ordinary restaurant forays I've ever had...

we started out with the traditional panchan(small, complimentary appetizers)...I especially liked the kongnamul(cold bean sprouts in sesame oil) and the mu-chae(julienned radish in a sweet, vinegary sauce with chili powder)...

we hadn't expected the overabundance of extra food, and so had ordered another appetizer--the seafood pancake. It was, in truth, delicious, until I started actually *looking* at it...this may sound a little immature, but once I saw all those long tentacles, I couldn't eat it with the same wantonness...I had to labor to pick each rubbery arm out before I ate a slice of the(pizza-size) pancake...nevertheless--wonderful!...

when it comes to entrees, I honestly can't remember what I ordered(probably something 'safe' and 'healthy', and therefore, 'boring' haha)...I only remember picking off my fiance's barbecued beef...delicious...

we were so ridiculously full by the end of the meal, that when dessert came, it was quite refreshing--a bowl of sikhye--simple, sweet, rice water...a perfect ending to a great meal!"}
{"text":"The service was very good, though I was there 3 in the afternoon and there had only been one other table. Our group split three dishes and got refills on sides, no problem. The potatos were the best next to the radishes and sprouts. The kimchi could have been better. Really - a lot better. The portions seemed a bit small for the price but it was filling."}
{"text":"Very good, very happy, very karaoke!!! Very atmosphere,  very teriyaki chicken, very sushi, very joy joy!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a shot again after being disappointed a year ago from the last time I came. The servers are always sweet and I have no problem with them at all! It's just how horribly made there dishes are.. for the price I'm paying I expect that even the simple dishes (bibimbap, doenjang/kimchi jjigae, jjajangmyun, etc.) would be good but they're so bland and tasteless. My tangsooyuk came out soggy and undercooked while my jjajangmyun had maybe two chopsticks full of noodles. Then after sending back my unsavory tangsooyuk they made sure to tack on an 18% gratuity. When regarding the kbbq side the meat quality and prices have much to be desired..

On a positive side their sushi and rolls are not half bad. So stick with the japanese dishes! 

If you're looking for good Korean this is not the place for you. I'd rather make the trek to Hodori in Mesa."}
{"text":"2/5 for service! 5/5 for food! The sushi here is my favorite in town. great selection, happy hour prices are great. Fun atmosphere. The last couple visits though the service has been lacking, it was me and my daughters boyfriend's Birthday and when my Girlfriend asked where i wanted to have my birthday dinner, Ohya was my top choice . She made a reservation for dinner and we were there on time. we were seated, then proceeded to sit with no way to order no drinks or water for almost 30 minutes finally the manager noticed us looking around for help as we were contemplating getting up and leaving, he came over and asked if we have been helped ,we said no not yet I haven't seen anybody since we were sat. then the waitress who had walked by us 30 times finally came and asked if we wanted drinks. we didn't have a menu as they have a paper menu for their sushi that you mark then she brought four of the five of us our drinks and we had to ask twice to get water for the fifth person after having to ask twice for the paper menus then having to wait for her to come back so we could ask for a pen to fill the paper menu out. when the food finally arrived it was great! then we ordered some to go rolls. even though the rolls we ordered were on the happy hour menu, because we were having them put in boxes, we had to pay full regular price, seemed odd as we were having it added to the same check. anyway,  we sat for an additional half hour or more waiting for the to-go rolls,   When she brought the check they had already added the gratuity $30 for pretty bad service!! their was only 5 of us , and most places only automatically add a gratuity if your party is six or more. I guess not here . I felt kind of ripped off. I wasn't happy about it but I paid my bill took my rolls and we left. I do have to say that for two of us having our birthday dinner, they did give us a frozen Slice of Cheesecake and a couple of little macaroons on a plate that was very nicely decorated and that I did appreciate. I just felt for the service I got I was not happy with having a $30 tip automatically added to my bill for a party of only five."}
{"text":"Absolutely worst service ever! I read the reviews and saw other yelpers complain about the service but wanted to give the business the benefit of the doubt. So, my fiancé and I went in and waited a little bit for seating. Yes it was a Friday night so I understand it will be busier than a weekday. We waited forever to order our food. When the food finally came out, we were not offered any utensils. I mean NONE! So my fiancé had to go up to the bar and grabbed the chopsticks, napkins, and straws himself. We also needed a spoon that was not provided at the bar so we had to flag down a waitress which was no where to be found. The portions are small and way overpriced. We also needed refills for our waters....and never got it. We ran out of water half way through dinner and never got a refill..even though I flagged them down again and asked for a refill. I was absolutely irritated that the food did not even taste pleasant. If the service was way better...I would've probably given them maybe 3 stars. But I wish I can give zero stars."}
{"text":"The food was OK.  I had the bulgogi beef and short ribs.   Nice décor.  There was one waitress serving and the service was terribly slow.  All in all I'd say try it for yourself.  I wasn't all that impressed but I wasn't unimpressed either."}
{"text":"1/5 for service. I've been here several times, I consider myself a regular. It was a busy night so my friend and I waited about 25 mins for a table. Once we were seated we waited another 10 minuets before we were asked what we wanted to drink. The food came out decently fast but our waitress forgot to oil our grill in order for us to cook our food. Also we didn't receive our water until we asked l

4/5 for food: This visit we ordered a combo meat plate with chadol, Kalbi, and bougoulgi. We also ordered soon soup with beef and green onion salad \"

Food is always good. Their meats are good prices for the amount you get. Although their soups are a little bland. Their salad is good, and their sushi is good as well. I come here for the food, I wish their service was better I would come more often."}
{"text":"Bad service , waited 45 min for appetizer and it never came and we got main entree before it was even ready. An went to cancel it and the waiter had an attitude. Had to keep asking several times for silverware and also got attitude for that as well. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I wish this didn't sound so harsh, but to be honest... the smell that we experienced when we walked into this restaurant was just overpoweringly foul. It smelled like a sweaty, dirty clothes hamper combined with a pungent not-so-fresh meat smell. We had been excited to come try this place, but we were out of there within 2 minutes. It was a memorably bad experience."}
{"text":"Totally worth a 5 stars but I have a feeling. . This restaurant can't be a 5 stars restaurant. This restaurant service wise or food wise is very casual. It is kind of weird when they open till 1:00 am but have no sushi chef at 9 when we came.. we had combo no5 for the Korean grill. About 39 dollars for a combo.. enough for 2 ppl or 3 if you don't eat that much"}
{"text":"Happy hour sushi all day!!! Who has that? Such a great place for fresh fish for a phenomenal price! They have a combo of both Japanese and Korean food and of course both are delectable. I pigged out on the deiji (pork) and the dalk (chicken) grilled meats served with the lettuce, spicy flavored Korean paste and loads of garlic - for a garlicky breath to fend the unwanted! We used the open table grill to cook the meats got a fresh BBQ, and munched on the side dishes. Bulgogi (beef) soft tofu soup was also served at your spicy-liking: mild. Also had to devour the fresh salmon and yellowtail nigiri. Minus the multiple servers and confusion and missing of the food here and there for a table of 5, the dinner was quite enjoyable. They also have Korean pop music going on in the background with their karaoke rooms! Maybe they might venture to open one on the east side of town??"}
{"text":"Gave this place another try. Honestly, the sushi isn't bad, but the service partially is. We started off with a female server who is petite and of Asian decent, she was not so good, almost rude. Before I could even order a role she said \"I wouldn't order sushi, we have about 9 rolls in front of you...\". Well maybe this shouldn't be named a sushi bar, she later ignored us for a few minutes. we still ordered it and did receive it about 30 minutes later. I believe she got a bad vibe off of us and decided to switch is up with Jade who was a great server! She deserves to run this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome Korean food in AZ that is also open late! Authentic and great atmosphere. This location also has karaoke too! East valley needs a location too!"}
{"text":"Food and drink comes out very slow. Waitress is nice though. I've had this dish at many other Korean places as well and this time was totally different. Our Jajameuyng was had a very smoky aroma, and the moment I took a bite, I could taste the burnt charcoal flakes. I took a closer inspection and found the black burnt flakes floating around the noodle. If a restaurant accidentally burns their food, they should throw it away and make a new one for their customer. Saving a few dimes and skimping on quality of food will cost you a customer. First and last time that I will come here."}
{"text":"Honestly worst experience of my life. Came in at 9:15, didn't get seated till 10:30. There was an open table the whole time but they didn't sit us there for whatever reason. After an hour and 15 minutes they seat us at the table that was open the whole time!!!! Didn't even bother to ask what we wanted to drink, and just brought us waters 15 minutes later. We asked for some sodas and both the coke and Dr. Pepper were flat, as if it was an old 2 liter bottle.... Took our order and brought our food 30 minutes later... We never got any side dishes like the other tables there.... The grill ended up going out half way through cooking the meat, took them 10 more minutes to come to the table so we could tell them the food was not cooking. We had 5 guests (one was a 2 year old) and they only brought 4 bowls of rice. They tried to charge us $24.99 for a 2 year old ?? On top of all that... We ordered a spicy tofu soup as soon as we sat down and after an hour we still never got the soup. After all this happened we were just ready to leave. We ended up telling them that we no longer wanted to eat there and that we would pay for the food we had gotten. Which was really only enough for 1 person considering it was \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\". They tried to charge us full price for 5 guests and for the soup that we never received. Tried to give the white blonde girl the benefit of the doubt that maybe she was new but after talking to another employee she had been there for a while... Absolutely horrific experience... Will never return and will definitely spread the word about this awful place!!! Would leave 0 stars if I could...."}
{"text":"We literally just walked out of this place. We tried the newer location and walked out because a waitress didn't come to our table for 30 minutes. This location was HORRIBLE tonight. The hostess didn't know where to seat us and then once we were seated, I looked up and the waitress was in the back, on her phone, PICKING HER TEETH! She then flicked her food particle in the trash, didn't wash her hands, and started to check on every table BUT ours. I am so disappointed because this place was once so delicious and the service was AMAZING! I will never return to this place. It is unsanitary and extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"The only reason why this place got 3 stars is because their spicy kalbi tang is awesome here. I've had a few meat dishes and spicy tofu soup and they were ehhhhh. 

Idk what these other people are talking about that their tofu soup is good because it's not. Unless they changed there recipe from the last time I had there soft tofu soup. 

Either way if you want soup get their spicy kalbi tang."}
{"text":"Sushi took over an hour to make while there were only four other tables occupied. Three different  waitresses walked passed us and didn't fill up my drinks, yet they kept saying that they were sorry for the wait. The waitresses are uneducated about the menu.  The waitress severed my religious Hindu girlfriend pork which I luckily caught before."}
{"text":"This place is OK, definitely somewhere I will eat if in the area. I really like their lunch bento boxes. The place has better ambiance than other Korean places I have gone to. Like a few others have stated, the service is sometimes not great even when they are slow. I usually order off the Japanese menu but I've had the BBQ and it was pretty good. Also a reason for the three stars is my husband had the ramen last time we went and it made him sick, I'm not sure if it was something bad or an additive in the food. I really love the kimchee and other extras you get when you eat there."}
{"text":"Favorite kimchi and Korean dishes in the valley! 
Ask for Cassie...she is funny, attentive, and will definately make your dinner a more enjoyable experience.   New to Korean food?  Cassie knows the menu and will give you the perfect advice on what to eat.  She's always smiling and very helpful when waiting on my family.  I go there and ask for her all the time."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a bit biased because I ate amazing Korean food when I lived n Korea, but the quality of food at Ohyah is horrible. This was the third time I ate here and it will definitely be my last. I ordered a combo with samgyupsal, dwaeji bulgogi and kalbi. The samgyupsal was extremely thin with zero flavor, and the same could be said about the kalbi. About 70% of what was brought out was bone. Yes, I know kalbi has bones and it enhances the flavor, but I didn't pay nearly $40 to eat bones. The dwaeji bulgogi was OK and it at least provided enough to fill me up a little with the rice. I'd give the taste of the meats a 2/10, the serving size a 3/10 and the service a 7/10. To the casual diner that enjoys Korean BBQ, this place may me enjoyable to you, but for me, who knows what good Korean food should taste like, I wouldn't eat here again, even if the meal was comped. Next time I'm craving some Korean food I'll make the extra drive down to Mesa, Tempe or Gilbert because at least I'll feel full and the food tastes better."}
{"text":"If you like sashimi and good service then this is definitely not the place for you. My yellowtail sashimi was subpar(connective tissue in every piece) and the roll I received was incredibly mediocre like something you could pick up in a grocery store. I don't think it is the fault of the sushi chefs. They did a wonderful job but you can't make magic with bad recipes. The waitress also forgot my husband's order. When we confronted her, she said that the chicken teriyaki takes much longer to cook then the beef teriyaki which someone else at the table ordered(30 min longer??). Everyone else at the table had received their food long before and were almost done eating. We all saw her go straight to the computer and enter in my husband's order after I said something. She would not own up to her mistake and was rude about it. Had she just apologized I would have been more understanding. The second star is only because the sushi chefs made a nice presentation of everything. It's not their fault they have crap servers, materials and recipes to work with. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was recommended here by a friend long before and since then I've been to this restaurant quite a few times. I usually come here with friends since they love the sushi and how there are many to choose from and try. I personally always get the ramen there. Each time I've come here I've been well taken care of, and tend to get the same waitress most of the time. Her name is Casie. She's very nice and attentive. I've never felt like I've waited too long when she was my waitress. I give this place a 5/5 stars for the great combo of food and service! I'm definitely going again!"}
{"text":"my friend and I had dinner here.we ordered a lot such as k9 korran bbq steak and yakisoba with beef . spicy tuna roll ...(see pic )the spicy tuna roll is soooo yummy i liked it so much.the portion was decent our serivce was friendly and food was good we will definitely come back !!!"}
{"text":"Place is okay I got the bulgoi plate but I wish I would have cooked it, but it requires two order. I got the soup as well very good seafood soft tofu soup but such a little portion for $8. I used the living social was kinda far and spending $15 on bulgoi should be all you can eat like it is in sf and dc! right across this asu extension. The mini plates are good and they do offer free lettuce and refills on the ones you like. free wifi!"}
{"text":"I had a blast at this OHYA sushi! They have a couple of cool karaoke rooms. They serve up really great banchan. They come in 2 sets of three. Three dishes were spicy and three were mild. They were all delicious. I ordered the piping hot and super spicy kimchi chigae or kimchi stew. It was beautiful and delicious. I cannot wait to come back to try more of their dishes. I am now a fan of Good Day Pineapple Soju. And a Yoju cocktail that tastes like spiked Yakult.

A shoutout to YELPERS Ainee B. for organizing the soiree, and Kimberly B. for being the illustrious birthday girl! All the people I met that night were super fun. Our server was terrific!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this place as its right by my house and I would love to find a great sushi place close by. When we get there and told them we had a Groupon they showed us all the stuff we would not be getting with a Groupon. They directed us to the much more expensive menu for Groupon users. Completely cancels out the idea of buying a Groupon when I am just charged more for using it. Food not great and definitely not worth $62 for 3 people. Wont be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! I love sushi and my husband spent a few years in S Korea, normally Korean places in AZ either have good cooked food or good raw sushi but never both. THIS PLACE DOES!! My staples are the Spicy Tuna, Spicy Crab and most of all the Volcano Roll (I dream about this roll). They do happy hour pricing and all-you-can-eat 1-2 times a month. I don't know if i have a stomach big enough to benefit from the all you can eat, so I haven't done it yet. My husband gets their Korean soup and can't wait to try their Bu Dae Chigae, apparently none of the other places we have gone to have offered that dish. Love that they bring sides and keep them traditional and absolutely love their sushi!"}
{"text":"This place a new local favorite of ours, tried on a whim one night and have been back 3 times and so far my favorite is the chicken katsu and the tempura shrimp udon noodles, boba's are great and reasonably priced. The staff is nice, it appears to be family run, but the only thing is, try not to ever use the bathroom... it is in the very back beyond boxes and boxes of stuff and has a foul smell to it!  Overall great Korean bbq at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"Was very hesitant between 3 stars or 4 but we all had those busy nights at a job before. Kudos to this place for opening late that is probably why their busy. Didn't know what our server name is but she was alright. She was a little rushing at times but it was busy so I understand. They seem a little understaff so maybe they need to work on hiring more workers. 

Spent a little over 100 dollars for 4 people with combo 5 for KBBQ, and sushi combo. The meats was so little.. for that price you should just wait for their Tuesday special for all you can eat. Meat tasted alright, I've had better meats before. Sushi tasted fresh and good, no complaint. After all, this restaurant is pretty decent. They have great deals once in awhile and it's worth trying. Will come back, but won't come back often."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Fifth time here never once disappointed.  If you have never been here I recommend trying it.  This spot is going to become one of my new go to restaurants."}
{"text":"Small place, but great food, BBQ is great, good place for hanging out with friends, with Korean beer!"}
{"text":"We  were seated immediately.  The tables were very small especially when we planned to cook our meal.we first ordered two sushi rolls they came Fer the meat had arrived.  The sushi was fair . The amount of meat we got for three was may be a pound of meat .The meat was  not well seasoned . . The ri bs were got was not edible because it was so chewy. The waitress forgot our order of tea.we were very disappointed"}
{"text":"Restaurant has a hip and clean atmosphere. I was seated right away with a very friendly waitress, that was very patient and came around a couple of times while I read the menu.  It was hard to decide what to order because their was so much selection, which is awesome! In the middle of your table they have an inset grill. I looked over to the table on my left to notice a party of four having fun grilling up their meat on it, it did smell great.  I also noticed a tv by the bar that had cute pictures displaying photos of their signature sushi dishes. I wanted to try everything after seeing some of the art of these dishes, everything looked so good. I was in the mood for some sushi.  Well finally I ordered the spicy tuna roll off of the signature menu, and my husband ordered 3 different rolls off of the traditional. We also ordered an appetizer of an egg roll. 

The egg rolls were so yummy, we scarfed them down.  Then the sushi started rolling out.  Wow we ordered a ton of food. I really liked everything.  My two favorites were the signature spicy tuna roll, and the tradition Salomon roll.  All was excellent though. We will be making this our new favorite sushi stop. 
Next time I want to try a hot dish, just because everyone else's food smelled so great."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, service was excellent. Our server ran the entire restaurant and was really nice. Could potentially use a little more variety on the sushi side... but still pretty decent. I would go back."}
{"text":"The sushi here is very good, and reasonably priced for the quality and quantity you get. The contemporary vibe and layout of the restaurant is pleasing, and the service is very friendly. I'm also glad they kept the polished log benches/chairs from the previous incarnation of the establishment."}
{"text":"We just ate lunch here for grill korean BBQ and i will not be coming back here anymore. Service was good but the quality of meat and the amount that we got for what we paid for were not satisfactory at all."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had Korean food. I was a little hesitant to go eat dinner at 8:30 in a place I was not familiar with but this place was packed! The food was excellent, service was great and the environment was unique."}
{"text":"Simply the food is delish. To start, I urge you to try the Fire Cracker appetizer it is a mouthful deliciousness. Bo Ssam is also a notable mention of great tasting food.  I've tried most things on the menu and found most to be very good.  The Karaoke room is an added bonus,  fun with a group of friends and family . The service is nice and friendly, especially Sue, she will go out of her way to make sure everything is just right.  I'd recommend this as great place to eat."}
{"text":"Took forever to be seen by waitress. Not busy. Didn't ask me for anything to drink. Food was not bad but not good either. Got my order wrong. Nothing to write home about. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"I love coming to ohya. 
The food is always great, the service is good and friendly. 
I bought my uncle to ohya, it was his first time having Korean food. He loved it."}
{"text":"Where to start... Happy hour all day? $5 for sake! Not much of a beer person but great deal! Customer service really was bad! Went with a party of 5. When we were finally seated we waited for our cups of water. After viewing the menu and our menus were put to the side I had to literally call a waitress over because no one came after the waters were dropped off. Ridiculous. The food was great and so where the appetizer. Try the fire cracker? Lol it's baked jalapeños stuffed with cheese. Pretty good not too spicy. There was too much food to remember the names to them all. BF had the California roll easy to say he loved it! When u come with a party of 5, gratuity is included with your bill!"}
{"text":"This review is just for the food, I haven't tried out the karaoke rooms yet.

Definitely one of the best Korean restaurants in the Valley, from the handful we get to choose from. I like that there is a grill at the table, but I was disappointed to learn that they do not have all you can eat. Back home in California, AYCE can go for $18-25, but here, you can get combos that are around $35-40 for three people. Still, the food is good. 

Another thing I wish they had is a larger variety of banchan. Their fish cakes are good, and so is the kimchi. Their Rainbow rolls are pretty good, as well as their sashimi. The servers try to be attentive, but for the night I went, they seemed a wee bit understaffed. Plus, they also play some K-pop! Overall, I think this place is the best Korean restaurant in North Phoenix, and I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and I'll say the food was pretty good. I had noodles and black bean sauce and kimchi pancake. The flavor of both was great but I did not like the texture of the pancakes it was a smidge too soggy for my liking. The serving size was good too so enough to enjoy as leftovers. I'll definitely try other things in the near future"}
{"text":"This review is a little late... my boyfriend and I tried this place during their AYCE BBQ night. We had great service. Our waiter was quick and attentive (we were here earlier in the evening and the restaurant wasn't very busy). We went through 7 rounds and tried the bulgoli, LA galbi, jumuluck, ribeye, tongue, and chadol baegi. The meets were all of good quality except for our last round of bulgolgi. That round consisted of mostly fat. Everything had good flavor and I enjoyed all of it except the tongue. I have a weird avoidance of certain textures and the tongue was too chewy for me. The sides were the standard sides of kimchee, bean sprouts, macaroni salad, potato salad, etc. The only request I would have is to offer a half onion to season the grill (the waiter said it would be an extra charge) and provide shears to cut/trim the meat as some pieces were rather large."}
{"text":"Came in and ordered to go, they said it would be 20 minutes, which was fine. 40 minutes later I'm still sitting here waiting for my order of 2 rolls. I asked how much longer and was told \"well a big group ordered in front of you, when it's ready I'll bring it to you.\" I'll never come here again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday. We had a groupon and it's been on my radar. Ended up that we didn't read the fine print where the group in said \"Good for sushi only\" and we didn't get any sushi :(. But thank goodness their lunch specials were cheap! We got the Salmon Lunch Box. Pretty good. Alright size for a 6 dollar lunch salmon. The sides were small and the kind of sides you get with Korean BBQ (Never know what they are, I'll eat them but they are not my favorite and very small.) egg roll was a little squishy... But as far as the salmon goes, it was good and flavorful. Good white rice. Ramen was pretty good. Nice and big, plenty of meat and noodles. Broth was flavorful but not the best I've ever had. You can tell they are really trying with the decor. They've almost got it... The service was really great! Very sweet girls! I just don't think I'll be making any special trip back. But it's worth a try! I may go back for their all you can eat Korean BBQ that they have twice a month. If so... I'll update :)"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. Went in for lunch and didnt get my food after waiting ~50 minutes, was late to work and didnt even get a meal. No wonder it was barren in there. Cheap sushi and non authentic korean cuisine from what I saw."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever coming here and it sure was a good one! My boss and co workers all came here for a fun dinner and we all had a good time. The inside is pretty spacious! They have a bar and also a sushi bar. 

Looking over the menu I wasn't in the mood for a big meal so I decided to stick with something small and cheap. I decided to order sushi. Boy did they have a huge selection on a ton of rolls!! After glaring through the different rolls I decided to stick with my usual roll... the vegas roll! 

It was pretty packed inside so my sushi took around 10 minutes to arrive which wasn't bad considering how busy they were. My sushi was delicious! Now on to what my co workers ordered! My boss decided to go with the big feast! So the cool part about it is that you get to cook it yourself!! I thought that was totally awesome! They bring you the food raw and you cook to however your heart desires! 

I highly recommend this place and I will be returning again! 5 star for me ! Excellent service and food!"}
{"text":"We were in the area shopping and found this place through Yelp. 

The outside of the entrance was a little strange as there were two different sets of signs with two different names on the side of the building and then there was a banner that said \"OHYA\".  When we walked in, we thought the place had a nice setup and then you look left and you see paint supplies and other construction type items in an unfinished area. 

We were immediately seated but it took something like 20 minutes for our order to be taken. There was one waitress for 6-8 filled tables so it was obvious why the service was taking so long. The waitress wasn't brimming with friendliness but she was certainly cordial enough. 


We ordered some sushi rolls, shumai, a hot tofu soup and the teriyaki chicken. The side dishes were decent but not the best I've ever had. The kimchi though was pretty outstanding and yummy crunchy and fresh. I had to ask for a side of rice which was beyond strange as most Korean places automatically give you a side with your main. The eel on our rolls was pretty fatty (still yummy) as was the chicken teriyaki and the shumai was obviously frozen as it tasted mildly freezer burnt and the shrimp in my husband's tofu soup were still on the raw side. 

During our 2 HOUR dinner (told ya, the service is slooooow) we had plenty of time to think about if we would come back and I'm not sure that we will. The food quality wasn't horrible (Kimchi rocked!) but the service was so slow and you almost felt bad about asking the waitress for anything due to how swamped she was. 

It was a bit of an awkward environment and with 4-6 other Korean restaurants in a 4 mile radius, this place is not at the top of our list."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Been going here since it was next door. I love the rustic wood benches.  I was so happy they incorporated them into thier new space. I have never had a disappointing meal. Bulgoki is always on point.  The sides are fresh. I am always extremely happy when they have fish cake.. yummm. 
Staff is always kind and helpful. If you are in the mood for Korean Food. Stop in! You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Been twice in the last couple of months.
Both times was excellent.
Sushi is fresh and has a very nice presentation.
We like to cook our own food on the grill.
They got new grills in the table tops between my two visits.
I have tried the pork, chicken and beef.
Service is excellent and we never wanted for anything as they kept every glass filled and food on the table.
Love this place. Love it!"}
{"text":"I like this place because of the Japchae! It's awesome! The bibimbap is ok. Nothing extraordinary and it's served oddly. The rice is separated from all the meat and veggies. They gave us a bowl of the meat and veggies and a cup of rice. Their sushi is ok but the size is too small. Lol Overall, it's a good experience. The servers are nice and friendly. Definitely going back to try more!"}
{"text":"A fellow yelper told me I should check this place out.  He noted that from what he remembered it was okay, but that I should give it a go if I haven't been just to compare it to the rest of the Korean places I tried.  So, I took his recommendation and stopped in for a quick lunch with my husband.  

They have a good selection of Korean food, from various jigae's (hot pot) to nengmyun (cold noodle soup), as well as Korean-Chinese favorites like Jangpong (spicy seafood noodle soup) and jajangmyun (noodles with black bean past sauce).  They also have a pretty good offering for lunch specials, various bento boxes and combination plates.  

I got a nengmyun and galbi (marinated short rib) combo lunch and my husband ordered a bulgogi (marinated thinly sliced beef) and soon tuboo (tofu hot pot) bento.  Both our meals came with a side of california rolls, and banchan (side dishes) placed in a traditional bento tray.

The nengmyun, galbi, bulgogi, soon tuboo, and california rolls were good.  I would rank them fourth in terms of flavor and quality, after Chodang, Paldo Cafe, and Hadori/Takamatsu (tie).  However, I could not bring myself to give them any more than three stars.  Why you ask?

The mark of a good Korean restaurant is the banchan that they offer and, unfortunately, I can't say I liked any of Chuhgjib's banchans.  My criteria for an offering of good banchan is: 1) freshness, 2) flavor and 3) variety, and Chuhgajib missed the mark on all three counts.  We were offered a variety of seasoned veggies (cabbage, bean sprouts, and radish) as well as two kinds of kimchi (cabbage and cucumber).  The seasoned veggies were pretty one dimensional.  The predominant flavor for the bean sprouts and cabbage was salty and sweet for the radish; no garlic, no onion, not spicy, no sesame oil, no vinegar, etc. Both kimchis were okay, but again something was missing.  Also, the cucumber kimchi was too \"ripe\" for my taste.  

Note that many Koreans prefer their kimchi to be \"ripe\" or \"aged\" in the pickling process, so this could just be a matter of personal preference.  I like my kimchis to be fresh, newly made, no older than two weeks.  I only eat \"ripe\" kimchi when it is turned into kimchi jigae, which is the way it should be made.  (Never, never use fresh kimchi for kimch jigae.)  

The impression I was left with was that banchan was an afterthought, and that was a disappointment.  

So, all-in-all, I would have to give them three stars.  It's their banchan that's holding them back."}
{"text":"We came here right after we had Churn because I mean priorities. Dessert before dinner! Anyways, this place stays open till about 1am on a Thursday night so it was nice there was food options while most places were closed.

Our waiter was very sweet and welcoming. My fiancé thinks she was the owner? We liked her a lot. 

FOOD
- Galbi: We got two different kinds. The short rib one and the sliced up one. The marinades were great! However, the meat was so chewy. Not at all tender. So chewy that my jaw started to fatigue after chomping on my piece of meat for so long. 

- Sides: There were six different sides. They were okay, not our favorite selections. 

- Crunchy California Roll: I think it's hard to mess up a Cali roll so this was pretty good. 

Coming from San Diego, we have a lot of great Korean restaurants so this was just okay."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I had a great time. I always have fun when I come and Cassie was a Great server. She helped me pick out a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Time again, you guys just can't fuck up. I thank you for that. 

It's been cold here, and I like that; perfect weather for warm comfort food and you guys killed it again & again. 

Awesome staff by the way. Even in the shit storms of rush hour, they're still friendly & getting it done."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service . All the waitresses were blatantly ignoring us and no one came by to take our order while every table around us was being served. No one came up to ask us what we wanted to drink either. I decided to leave after waiting 20 minutes when no one came by to help us."}
{"text":"So idk why people give this place a bad reviews. ..you come to AZ this the place to go!! Sorry CA people we don't live by the ocean and have as fresh as fish as you do. .get over it! We had great service from Brittany she is fabulous and George the Sushi chef is amazing. ..and the owner Chris is very accommodating. ..great place...great service. .great people!! The fish is fresh..the portions are great. .and the prices are amazing!!! I have eaten sushi many many place in the world and this is a AZ best!!"}
{"text":"There's not a lot of places in Arizona for AYCE KBBQ so even though this place is a good 45 minute drive I try to make it out every once in awhile on Tuesdays. The staff is really friendly and put up with my group trying to devour as much protein as possible in the time limit while keeping Yoju and sake bombs coming even though the place was packed which it almost always is so make sure you're not starving already when you come. For the times I've decided to skip the all you can eat menu I've just got a combo 1 with my friends especially if they've never had KBBQ before and get too picky. Their Nak Ji Bokum was also really good when I ordered it for my buddy that only eats seafood."}
{"text":"Given the area it's not bad. I've tried their AYCE offering which is edible. The one good thing about this place is that they are relatively generous with their portions. The other menu items are okay if you're really jonesing for some Korean food or quick sushi. 

Things I've had here:
Bimbim bap: sometimes they run out of the clay pots and then it's not nearly as good. This portion is a little smaller than I'd like and the meat is a little lower quality

Soon dobu: spicy Korean tofu soup. It's hard to get this wrong and they don't. But I've definitely had better.

Korean fried chicken: very very generous with their portions here. It's way too much sweet sauce for my taste though. I would honestly skip this.

Sushi: it's actually not bad to be honest. The cut of fish are average but they don't drown you with rice and their pieces are pretty good sized.

Their menus and tables are usually some sort of sticky which isn't great and the BBQ pits are electric which make cooking a real hassle. I would say you could do better but if you're in the neighborhood and don't want to commit to a drive then you can certainly come here."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I would have given them 0 stars. I was with a party of 12 and only got 6 waters. I wanted Korean BBQ and almost all of the table tops didn't work. The party of 12 got moved around twice as the staff was looking for a table top grill was broken"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times for lunch with some friends from school.  I think the food is decent-good.. depending on what you get.  I'd rate the tofu soups 4 stars while the bulgogi and other marinated meat dishes 3-3.5 stars...  besides, the meat portions are usually a bit less than you expect.  I had the jap chae (glass noodles) once and it was good.. other than the tofu soup, which I usually get, the other dishes I've had were just alright"}
{"text":"Really good food. Took my beautiful girlfriend on a date we cooked some good meat and it's next to a boba place. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I am writing this in anger over recent events.  Maybe in a week I would rate my experience as 2 stars.  Tonight, however, 1 star is generous.  Prior to Chuhgajib's expansion I went often, even as a student on a shoestring budget.  Back then, it was small, cramped, and smokey, and yet I would have rated it five stars.  The staff was friendly, and the food was incredible.  Now, Chuhgajib has renovated; they offer more than double their original tables and a bar area, and have staff to accommodate their growth.  Unfortunately, the service of the additional staff leaves MUCH to be desired.  This brings me to tonight's visit and the reason for this review.

I was part of a party of four.  We did not make a reservation, but when the other couple arrived at 6:50, they were told we could have a BBQ table at 7:30.  We met them and stayed at the bar.  The new sushi offerings are fun; they have unique names and combinations, and we all enjoyed them.  Around 7:45, we were still sitting at the bar while two BBQ tables were being cleared off.  A group of six came in and was seated at two of the BBQ tables with little to no wait at about that time...while we were still waiting for a table.  The server that had been keeping us abreast of our wait time went over to the other server, and shortly there was a small group talking, pointing at us and the group that had just been seated ahead of us.  At this point, we no longer existed as far as the staff was concerned.  No water refills, no updates on our table,  no \"Is there anything else I can get you while you wait?\"  We couldn't even get eye contact with a server.

TWENTY MINUTES LATER, over an hour after we had arrived, we flagged down a server and asked what was going on.  At that point, we were told that there was a mix up and the other group had a reservation ahead of us.  If that was the case, they were at least twenty minutes late for their reservation and their reservation should have gone kaput.  If it was an accident that they were seated in front of us and no one had the nerve to unseat them, someone should have admitted to the mistake.  Even that would have been okay in my book.  But the staff at that point simply decided we didn't exist because no one wanted to be accountable for us being stuck at the bar and not eating the BBQ we had come for.

We were told at the same time that another BBQ table had closed out and the staff was waiting for the party to leave before seating us.  Well, at 8:10, there had been enough waiting.  We got the bill, paid, and only left tip because a dollar in change wasn't worth any more waiting on the meek and irresponsible servers.

My disappointment is a reflection of how excited I was to see Chuhgajib after its renovation.  Sadly, the staff does nothing to overcome the extremely poor service.  We received a discount on a future purchase, but that means nothing when I never plan to return.  It's time to experiment with other Korean BBQ in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came here with the family and the place wasn't to busy. The waitress was friendly, we did have trouble ordering due to the fact that we've never had Korean food. She could have done a better job at explaining the menu to us. I felt like I paid a lot to cook my own food. I will say the food was good as well as the experience but i would have rather cooked it at home. They do give you the option tho if you want it cooked in the kitchen or you do it yourself ..  it wasn't the fact that we had to cook it ourselves it was the fact that we had to figure out the menu on our own and kind of guess what to order."}
{"text":"Good service but below average good. Ordered ayce sushi and the quality was absolutely terrible! We didn't order much and the restaurant was not busy. Not a great place for sushi."}
{"text":"I have not re-tried their bento boxes yet, however, a recent trip to OH YA for a kareoke night was very pleasant. They have really made a lot of change lately with the guy manager. The atmosphere is still youngster up beat and fun but the quality of food is so much better. So I would say they have succeeded at focusing on what they had to improve! I suggest getting the Korean Fried Chicken A.K.A the real KFC! Lol. With the sauce on the side. I don't know what is their secret and I don't even know even though I am Korean, their Korean Fried Chicken is very very close to what I used to have in Korea!  I cannot wait for another karaoke night there. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Nice people working there, but as far as that.....didn't seem that clean..Everything was sticky.  Had the Korean bbq..all I can say is that it's not like LA Korean bbq restaurants.  Just the grill alone..it boiled the neat..meat was all fatty too.
The happy hour is good for beer and sake."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Great good, great staff. Sushi bar is so good! We always go for the grill setting and service is prompt. Everyone is friendly!  Portions are average and priced decent. There's a variety!  I'm impressed with their sushi bar...good eats"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I checked this place out yesterday and found out it was place we've been to before, but they have since expanded , remodeled and renamed itself. I'm actually quite exited about this place since its so close to home and they have private karaoke rooms for reasonable rates. Not as cheap as in LA, but it will do. I ordered their Ramen, it was tasty. The broth was a little on the sweet side normally, I'm use to a more savory taste, but it was good! Also good portioning size as well. This will definitely become a go to place for us now."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch experience. The waitress was super friendly and helpful. I ordered the bento box with chicken katsu and it was amazing. It had the right crisp and the rice was fluffy and great. I believe I will be making frequent stops here for lunch when I'm in the area for now on. So good!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, but the sushi was WARM and left a bad taste in my mouth. Waitress pushed us to order quickly, then ignored us. My fellow diner asked for an extra lemon in her water, and the waitress never brought it. Restaurant was uncomfortably warm--it turns out the waitress had forgotten to turn on the air conditioning IN A RESTAURANT THAT SERVES RAW FISH. Sashimi was tiny. Will never go again."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean food in the Valley. We absolutely love the Korean Hot Tofu soup here! The service is consistently great here even when the restaurant is busy. Kelly always has a smile on her face and makes sure we have excellent service every time!"}
{"text":"We ordered their BBQ combo number 3 I think. It's way too sweet for my taste. And their service I will say alright. We asked for a little help but the waitress was like I will get your server to help. Uhhhhj. Might come back."}
{"text":"Congratulations on your newly remodeled restaurant, Chris and Onni! I had the Korean BBQ short ribs lunch special a few times and it was a nicely big portion. Everything in my bento box tasted very good! I had the opportunity to meet them personally and I know for a fact that the owner is a great guy with a big heart. I am looking forward to visit again with my man when he comes back to town soon and invite some of my friends to try out the karaoke. Very excited."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and same minor two complaints. Service is too slow, and seating area is too hot."}
{"text":"4 stars, not 5.

Its located next to a nail salon, boba/pho house, and a FedEx. the plaza itself isnt super clean or well kept; but who goes out to eat for the view? I go for the food and free water. The water is most likely filtered tap, they dont have a wide variety of drinks, but what local restaurant does. The food on the other hand is fun to eat and handle. Perfect place for a nice and cozy date with lots of opportunities for random jokes. Sushi and korean bbq, all for a good price in my opinion (college student). The taste is superb and fresh every time ive been here. Rarely the sushi falls apart when picking it up with chopsticks, no chef is perfect. I wouldve gave it a 5 if the place was cleaner and the wooden.furniture was well kept."}
{"text":"I've been a regular of this place ever since they first opened, and they've consistently been one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley. The waitstaff tend to be pretty hospitable, the food is delicious, and the inclusion of boba drinks on their menu in the last year or so definitely makes this place worth visiting again and again.

A word to the wise, however - while the food here is extremely delicious, the the taste and preparation may vary greatly depending on the chef on duty. So, yes, while the food is good nine out of ten times, just prepare yourself for the occasional dud. Also, if you've never had Korean food before, be prepared to pay a little more than you normally would at an Applebee's or a Chinese restaurant - you will certainly get your money's worth, but be prepared all the same."}
{"text":"First time coming to Ohya. Pretty nice with 2 karaoke rooms and a sushi bar. When we got seated, had to wait for a few minutes to get our menus. Like usually when hostess seat you, they give you menus? Confused part. 

P.s. the hostess wasn't friendly at all. No smiles, just \"how many\" like dang, can I get a hi or hello.

Then our server took our drinks & food order. She was really nice but the Service was okay. We had to flag down our server a few times to get stuff refilled. Food taste okay,wasn't as great compare to the other Korean BBQ I been too. Side dishes really lack in taste and it wasn't fresh. Well the bean sprouts, my boyfriend said it was still frozen. There ddukbokkie was not good at all, only gave me 6 rice cakes the rest was veggies. I was so disappointed Bc I was excited to try it. But it was just BLAH to me. Nothing special about this place. 

I don't think I'll return unless someone pays for my food,l. Hahaha. Also we went because I bought the $7 coupon that's worth $20 of food and drinks. So it wasn't bad at all. Other than that, just come before dinner if you want great service :)"}
{"text":"We came here after an afternoon exploring the dessert botanical gardens. Their tofu soup and bibimbap tasted all right. They had the standard side dishes, but not as much as other places."}
{"text":"First time here for husband and I. Wasn't sure what to expect with all the mixed reviews, but had a LivingSocial deal & no desire to cook on Thursday night, so in we went. The lady that greeted us at the door (and took our order) was very pleasant and polite but very difficult to understand with her heavy Asian accent. Decor is not bad, everything is black. Hopefully not to cover up dirt (which was plainly visible in the bathroom.) Table itself seemed pretty clean though. Oddly, hip-hop music was playing the whole time we were there. There were a few Korean (I assume) families dining in the restaurant during our meal (that may or may not mean anything).

The menu is fairly extensive, with many choices of sushi, Korean food, Japanese entrees, and Korean BBQ (which is done at the table if you order that). Every day they had a drink special and Thursday was Four Peaks drafts for $2, which worked for us! We ordered Bibim Bap with Spicy Seafood served in hot stone bowl and Spicy pan fried Squid with Vegetables (Ojing Ah Bokum) to share, and requested a Mango Pop Roll (\"Tempura white fish, cream cheese, fresh sweet mango, avocado rolled in soy paper, drizzled with spicy mango sauce with crunch\") to eat first as an appetizer.

Shortly, the Bibim Bap came out in a very hot stone bowl. A few minutes after that, the Korean side dishes & rice came out. Then a little later, the sushi (which looked incredible). We each had time to eat one delicious, sweet, sushi piece then the squid came out. Oh boy, did my eyes light up when I saw the squid dish - it was so hot, heavy steam was coming off it and it was sizzling like fajitas. I admit I actually said \"OH YA!\" when I saw the feast in front of us. The entrees were just the right amount of spice (we weren't asked how hot we wanted it to be, but we both enjoy very spicy food) and the flavor was perfect - especially in the squid dish. We decided to eat the sushi for dessert instead. It was so good, we ate everything in front of us. It was more than enough food though - next time we won't be getting an \"appetizer\" - we were stuffed! Everything was cleared away quickly when we finished, and our check came promptly. 

I give it overall four stars - 
5 for the food (It couldn't have been better)
3.5 for the service (attentive and polite but difficulties with communication)
2.5 for the ambiance (because the bathroom was so dirty and the music sucked)
4 for the value (seemed to be priced reasonably)

I will be back..."}
{"text":"The waitress at the bar was great! She is the only great thing about this pace.  We were a little unsure because it looks a little dirty and cluttered when you walk in but we decided to be adventurous.  The chefs got our order wrong and the beer was flat.  The waitress was great and tried really hard to get it right.  The chef also used a dirty knife to cut our sushi as different sauces were on the wrong sushi rolls where it was cut.  Probably won't head back here."}
{"text":"This place has it all - bar, sushi, Korean food, kbbq. It can satisfy a lot of your Asian cravings at once. Slow service at the beginning but the server checked on us multiple times during our meal which I thought was rare at an Asian restaurant. 

I had the jja jjang mian (black bean paste noodle) and the bibimbap (stone pot rice) and really liked it. Very big portions for the jja jjang mian for a really good price too!  ($8) 

Definitely would go back again! The food was definitely comparable to what I get in LA!"}
{"text":"It was 4.9.16 at about 8 or 9 pm. The first time i was here we had a server named Jamie she was great. When we decided to come back for my boyfriends birthday we had a server who couldnt care less. Just interested in the forced tip. I used to be a server and gratuity was never forced unless it was a big party. That was not a big party. She had square glasses and brown hair light skin and acted like we were dumb. Had no sense of humor. I was extremely disappointed compared to our first experience."}
{"text":"I'm a first generation Korean American, and I worship the food my grandmother used to make. Alas I only learned a few of her recipes before she passed and it's really hard to find what I need to make good old fashioned home cooking.

So instead I go to Chuhgajib Korean BBQ. It's a tiny place that has a homey feel right down to the TV playing bad Korean soap operas in the dining room. Most of the servers speak english but there are a couple who are harder to understand, it's called authenticity! At least you know the food is being made by, oh my gosh...Koreans!

Ok as for the food. My biggest test is always the tempura. Most Japanese restaurants in the valley have failed miserably at this, being too oily and heavy. Here the tempura is light, crispy and not at all greasy. Almost as good as grandmas, and I don't say that lightly folks!

Next up is the quintessential dish Jap Chae. Glass noodles tossed with veggies a touch of meat and sauce. The jap chae served here is a little saucier than what I'm used to but delicious all the same! 

You must try the BBQ, a big plate over propane in the middle of the table where you then sizzle big chunks of meat. Yum. The galbi is well marinated and boneless which is a nice touch, great flavor. All served up with crisp lettuce and sauce to wrap all the tastiness up in.

My only complaint is that the kimchi is a little weak on the spice. I can eat a whole dish and not feel my mouth warm up in the least. It's very good kimchi, not at all rank or sour like other places I've been. But if you are looking for spice you really must assure the servers you can handle it as they are a little wary of people asking for \"hot\".

All in all this is a nice place to relax, grab a good meal that doesn't leave you feeling gross and stuffed. Just happy with a tummy full of good home cooking!"}
{"text":"maybe not what you are looking for but a good introduction to find out
I tried two times...once at lunch...and once for BBQ dinner....both meals were interesting....neither was bad...but neither was great....3 sums it up"}
{"text":"A bit pricey for what you get. Overall a great time with good food. Split the combo for more options and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I go to this sushi bar regularly; however, the last couple times I've been in I've had terrible experiences from the sushi falling apart and the waitress telling me I don't know how to properly eat sushi and it's my fault it's falling apart. Whenever I've been in since I started going here it seems as if everyone of the restaurants same race gets treated extremely different than I, and the past couple times I've been in around 10 pm at night, I've been told the sushi bar is closed however they don't close till 11 on some nights and 2 am on other nights. The servers here are also extremely uncaring about the customer which is disappointing because the food here is good, but the service is just so terrible it makes it such a bad experience every time I go in. I want to give the place the benefit of the doubt however every time I go in, I seem to come out with yet another bad story about their customer service."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Draft beer DOS X served less than cold for $5.00. Ordered the Katsu chicken which was ok. Shrimp fried rice served with shrimp peel still on. For $7.95 I would expect they peel them. Did not try that \"cook your own meat\" as I am not into that. Probably a good place if you're trying to impress someone for the first time and want to hang around for a while. Not for me. Won't repeat."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm in love with all of their food! The Korean Bbq is to die for and every Tuesday on the 2nd and 4th week of each month is all you can't eat bbq and sushi!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time ever coming here and trying Koream BBQ. I loved it !  It was very delicious and great customer service ! : )"}
{"text":"I was in on Tuesday for their all you can eat sushi and BBQ, and it was very packed so we waited around an hour or so to be seated. Meanwhile the manager told us that the sushi station is closing soon we couldn't order any sushi because their was to many orders so he'll give us a discount he said... and in the meantime we were enjoying our BBQ and we looked in front of us and we saw the couple that were waiting behind us, eating sushi when the guy clearly said he couldn't do an order for us... I understand that the couple might be the manager's friend but that was clearly unfair and unprofessional telling us we can't order sushi but it's ok if his friends order sushi. Really disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tucked in the corner of an older strip mall, across the street from ASU's West Campus, OHYA Sushi Korean Kitchen delivers solid Korean BBQ at a reasonable price. It's a nice little place for food and conversation....as long as you don't mind the abysmal service.

I've been to OYHA several times over the past year - my son likes the Korean BBQ grill - but I've never been there for sushi (Frankly, the seeing the words \"Sushi\" and \"Korean\" together in the establishment's name is sort of a turn-off) and I've never been there for karaoke (I...ah...nevermind), so this review is strictly based on my experiences with their Korean BBQ.

The atmosphere is casual and the though they've managed to cram as many tables into their space as possible, half-wall dividers do a nice job maintaining some level of privacy. The walls are adorned with wood planks that used to serve as tabletops. Their new tabletops now feature electric grills, which I guess they assume don't require smoke hoods. I've never had an issue with smoke there, so I suppose they know what they're doing.

On to the food - They have a nice selection of meats to choose from. Note: When ordering BBQ there is a two meat minimum. We usually opt for one chicken (dalk bulgogi) and one beef (bulgogi or galbi). You get a decent amount of food and between the two of us we are usually stuffed. Along with the meat, you also get steamed white rice and a rather disappointing array of side dishes. Whenever I have Korean BBQ, I always look forward to the side dishes - here, not so much. First of all, there are only six, mostly bean sprouts and kimchee. Secondly, the kimchee has never really tasted very...fresh (yes, I know it's fermented cabbage and it's supposed to have that old flavor, but it's just not what I usually expect.) Anyway, the food is pretty good (depending on how my son cooks it ;)) and we usually leave very satisfied.

The main problem is the service. The service is beyond bad. With the large number of tables they have, during the lunch rush I have only seen one waitress working at a time. One. The last two times we were there, we have seen multiple parties get seated, then walk out 20 minutes later after never getting served. This seems to be a common occurrence. Yes the service is bad. The last time we were there, we had to ask for rice and a fork multiple times before we finally got them. I don't really blame the waitress here - I blame the management for not ensuring that the shifts are adequately staffed.

Anyway, I give the food 3 stars, minus 1 for the service. Come here for the food. You'll enjoy it. Just don't come if you're in a hurry or expect even marginal service.

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We had been there about a year ago and was not impressed.  
We decided to give it another try after finding a Groupon. WOW...it has improved 10k%. The food was wonderful and service perfect. Cammy took great care of us. It I had the Ohya sushi roll that was amazing and my daughter had the bulgogi. Perfect. ..It was so good, we went back and was shocked to see the place packed. On Tuesday's they have unlimited sushi for $22.00 and for like 10 bucks more add in unlimited Korean bbq. Too much for me to undertake but we were in the minority. 
Came home and bought another Groupon. Can't beat the deal."}
{"text":"With the mixed review they were getting since they changed the name, we weren't quite sure what to expect. Our family of 4 went there for dinner and we weren't disappointed. We had tuna poke salad, tuna, scallop and sweet shrimp sushi, gyoza and California rolls for appetizer. For main entree, we had bulgogi and pork belly on the grill, hubby had bibimbap and our daughter had a teriyaki bowl. From this visit Bulgogi and bibimbap along with Tuna poke salad get 5 stars while pork belly and California rolls get 3.5 stars. It was probably the way we grilled them but the pork belly was too tough. Bulgogi is definitely the way to go. To cook meat on the table you have to order at least 2 meat orders. 2 orders can be easily consumed by party of 2-3.  I really like the new, updated look. Music was upbeat and friendly and attentive staff made our visit enjoyable. We definitely weren't disappointed with our choice for dinner tonight! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here, the fish on their sushi is dry as a bone or ground up like cat food, i can tell they dont use high quality oul to fry and their sushi rolls wete disgusting. Im never eating here again. Save ur money, go somewhere that they actually serve u the fish they claim they serve u. Their bathrooms r super nasty too."}
{"text":"For my first Korean BBQ experience, it was great but could of been better. I fell in love with the idea of cooking my own food at my table but was let down with the lack of flavor/spice/seasoning/marinate. I had higher expectations for sure. 

I decided to have the 3\" cut beef and chicken. Most of the steak was frozen but the chicken wasn't, so that's a plus lol. Side dishes paired well with rice, lettuce wrap and your choice of meat. 

Was it a great experience? Yes. Will I be returning? No. Not because it's a bad place at all, I just think the way to go with this style of a dining experience is a higher end place with fresh ingredients. 

Blonde server was awesome though!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because of a groupon.  We have since gone back a second time.  The sushi is really good. George is great at what he does!"}
{"text":"This place honestly sucks with timely service. We ordered 4 rolls and edamame and it took them 50 minutes to serve us just the edamame. Another 20 minutes later came our rolls. I strongly suggest going somewhere else if you're really hungry and aren't trying to wait two hours for your food."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The sushi is good but Korean bbq is where it's at! I use to live in Korea and I love that Korean bbq is becoming popular in the USA. Ohya has great spices and their bbq is so tasty."}
{"text":"I was here with a group of friends that we often get together. We choose this place as one of our friends wants to Karaoke and they have private rooms which great for us as we are loud and obnoxious when we all together. With the private room we can be more wild...lol. They have two private rooms a small and a big. The room rate is $30/2 hours for small room and $50/2 hours for big room then $10/hour after the first two hours. The food here is always good. The service was lacking a bit other than that we had a great time."}
{"text":"I NOW SMELL LIKE BURNT TOAST SMOKE
All in All Taste..D+
Service. ...D (because the server was still polite and sweet)  *Some come for the Bulogi and are Satisfied.

**I came for the Sushi..and was CRUSHED!***

Ok, so I saw the YELP review and the photos and Video of the Shrimp Temp and Volcano roll had me sold.. but when I got in... I could immediately  see:
Dirty tables- understaffed with just 1 server who's really SWEET but probably  a better Hostess.

I sat for almost 7min. Before she brought me water w/lemon.. she didn't ask me just brought it that way

Next something in the kitchen was burning. Since the place is \"cozy\" the smell was everywhere.

The Gyoza for start.. FAIL I can't confirm but it tastes average like the frozen kind you pan fry w/water. 

Sushi...took over HALF AN HOUR I was literally putting on my Sunglasses to LEAVE when she came out with it.
Not to mention the Whole area is now clouded with Smoke and my eyes were waterig!!

So here it is...the TASTE. .can ALL be Forgiven? ???
Nope. The \"spicy peach sauce\" is NOT spicy and slightly watery. (??) The Volcano roll which was supposed to come out on Fire..water as fully extinguished...which is a match to my soul when the salmon skin was rubbery and under seasoned.  

Service... a guy came in and Hugged my server and after her laughing off how she had so many dirty tables ..started bussing!?!?!. Idk if he was a potential BF candidate or a True friend because  his shirt said Los Compadres not OHYA.  Lol 
I'm guessing  potential  Boyfriend because there was a double high five and kiss/peck at the end there. 

All in all... decent to low on taste and fail on service. The decor was creative and I give them props for effort. I hope the future  Scottsdale location is managed better."}
{"text":"Blah!!! Tried this place with a girlfriend of mine and the Groupon couldn't save this place. Unfortunately the sushi and rolls were poorly executed. The advocado was not at all ripe, super hard. Lacked in flavor and sauces, which made it dry to eat. The quality wasn't there."}
{"text":"I come from Orange County where Korean BBQ places in OC and LA don't come up short and I feel I have a pretty dang decent grasp on Korean BBQ, so finding a place since moving to Phoenix for KBBQ makes me oh-so-happeee. I've tried a couple other KBBQ places in the Glendale/Phoenix area, and this location (Ohya) is the only one that seems to have a good fun atmosphere, bek se ju, and all-you-can-eat nights. Although Cali places have the all-you-can-eat every night, I'm not understanding why places in Phoenix haven't adapted this concept (and for $20 per person at that and free green tea ice cream!).

Anyways, the first table we sat at - the grill wasn't working so the server moved my friend and I to a working grill to eat BBQ (not a problem). She was really nice about it and got us waters right away. The pricing is a bit much when they serve such a small amount of meat when ordering off the BBQ menu. We ordered brisket and bulgogi and the brisket would suuuper fatty. I've never seen such fatty meat. I felt like saying \"want some meat with that fat?\", and considering how much fat there was instead of meat, it shouldn't be priced what it is! The tofu soup I ordered at medium spicy and it was very sour and I never got an egg with it! I won't be ordering that again...

I can tell they cannot accommodate large parties, because they moved two different groups around to different tables and had to squeeze them in - and many of their grills weren't working. It was like playing a game of musical chairs & tables. This location is right across from ASU West campus tucked in a little shopping strip. We didn't have any problems with service, except a few times we couldn't get a hold of our server to order more drinks but it's understandable when a flood of peeps come rushin' in. Overall during this visit, service was good, the side dishes were good mainly the spicy cucumber and kimchi, the bulgogi was good, but the prices were a bit much and the meat was really fatty. 

UPDATE: So on 12/8/15, I went to their all-you-can-eat bbq and sushi night. Let me just say, I will never return again for the Korean bbq portion, maybe if I just want all-you-can-eat sushi. They charge $21.99 per person for just sushi, and only $25.99 for bbq and sushi per person. They limit what you order for bbq each round and they only give you 90 minutes from the first moment you place your first order. Once you reach the 90 minute mark, you're no longer allowed to order anything else. During regular bbq nights, they give you six sides and lettuce or salad, but for all-you-can-eat they don't give you lettuce/salad and only give you three small sides (no fish cake, no potato, no bean sprout). The meat portions are half the size of regular bbq (which was already a small portion to begin with). Our server Brian was super nice though...he hooked us up with a salad lol.

If you want to order nigiri sushi, they only bring you one piece per order and they limit how many things you can order per round. Also, they charge $10.00 for a bottle of soju. It was the most disgusting soju I've ever had and I've had some pretty bad soju. Stick with beer, sake, or hot sake. Lastly, if you don't finish everything you order, they charge you extra on top of what you're already being charged per plate that you don't eat. (This is understandable for all-you-can-eat sushi, but not bbq. That's ridiculous.) 

Recommendation for the restaurant: Go to K-town in Los Angeles and get some pointers on how to run a Korean BBQ restaurant - or even Korea where they have an entire buffet and charge $20-25 per person and you can pick whatever you want from the buffet as many times as you wish. Also, please stop buying such fatty meat. I felt like that's all I was eating was fat instead of actual meat (bulgogi, brisket, galbi). And stop charging $10.00 for crappy soju. I can get soju at a street vendor in Seoul for cheaper than that and it tastes better. Also, have an option for people who just want all-you-can-eat bbq... if LA and OC can do this daily and give larger portions and not cut the sides down in half for only $20.99 per person, I'm sure you can too. Just saying."}
{"text":"I used to visit here often as me and my sister love Korean food and this is the closest one to us, I think the food is great which is why it is our #1 place to go. The staff have definitely changed since then and saying that the service was bad was understatement. 

I came today during lunch hour with my sister and had to wait to be seated for about 10 minutes. It was understandable as they were super busy, but I think expecting a welcoming greeting isn't too much to ask for. We only stood there awkwardly and waited to be acknowledged. 

After we got seated, we waited another 15 mins until our server came to ask us what we wanted to drink but then she warned us that it would take 45 mins as the kitchen is slammed with orders. 

If they were that slammed, why didn't we just warned before we got seated? I could have saved 20 mins and taken my business elsewhere. Needless to say, we had lunch somewhere else. 

The server was still very nice but I won't be coming back here again as this was not the first time this has happened."}
{"text":"For an easy and quick review read this part.
Pros:
1. Place has the atmosphere. Great place to drink I bet.
2. Very clean place.
3. They run some lunch specials.
4. They give 15 percent off. 60 days expiration

Cons:
1. If you're not familiar with Korean flavor stay away 
2. Most of the food we ordered is lacking something, there is just that missing flavor.
3. Pricey- I think this should be between 3 to 4 price. 
4. A bit rude customer service and slow at the same time. (More on the review)

If you want some detailed review keep reading. I came here long time ago but wasn't using yelp by then. We had a bad experience \" a small friendly critter was on one of our food.\" I was a bit skeptical to come back here but let me put it this way, that previous incident did NOT in anyway affected my review. I was even open on trying everything. And when I say Everything I meant everything, even the sides that most of my colleagues didn't want to touch.

LET me try to do my best to individually give feedback on the food we ate. First the their most tipped food the bulgogi, it was too sweet for me. Just little onion and other than the sweet flavor I didn't tasted any other flavor, however my colleagues stated that I should had tried the pork bulgogi. Teriyaki chicken was lacking in flavor too, even though the meats were soaked with so much sauce. Chicken katsu was so bland, if you have tried any decent hawaiin place that has chicken Katsu, you will understand what i mean. Fried chicken that looks and feels like from Church's , crunchy but covered TOO much with flour. They also have sushi. We tried the Vegas roll  and the tempura. The tempura tasted good. I think that's the only reason why I liked the place, thus the one star. The vegas roll however did not do good on my taste buds. So little flavor. Lastly I also tried the different sides, the only thing that was okay was the cabbage.  So that's for the food's review.

Continue to read for miscellaneous part of the review. The service was quiet odd because the guy who was helping us was a bit slow. He also wanted to make sure WE knew that it was a Korean place when we asked for condiments that they did not have. The price also was a bit on the high price, felt like we dine on Scottsdale when there was only 5 of us and we paid on the high hundreds. 

The only thing I could add is that they have a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was my first time in a Korean bbq restaurant and I was not expecting to see stoves in the middle of the tables, just like Melting Pot.  Since Melting Pot is one of my fave restaurants I was excited.  We ordered the bbq combo #1 which includes pork, steak, and chicken.  We also ordered sake bombers and an rainbow roll.  Rainbow roll was great.  The bbq was decent, although it left a weird coating in my mouth.  There was plenty left over.  We did have a good time trying to cook everything while doing bombers.

2nd time around we had sushi.  Caterpillar, Spider, and Rainbow.  Rainbow and Caterpillar was good.  Spider was okay.

Service was good and bad.  They are super friendly and nice.  They make sure your water or drinks is filled.  But they forget things like utensils and napkins.  Our server also didn't explain how to use the stove since everything was written in Korean.  Even though we told them it was our first time.  We learned when we got our check how to turn it off or adjust the temperature.  No wonder it was hard to keep our meat from burning.  But they were so friendly that I can let those inconsistencies slide at a low key place like this.

On a side note:  they do have 2 small rooms available for karaoke parties.  Might be fun to get a group together and do sake bombers while rapping or singing.  

I give them 4 stars for now because I enjoyed both my visits.  It is more 3.5, so I grade them a B-"}
{"text":"Decent Korean BBQ on the west side...

The food was decent but it seemed a bit pricy for what I ended up getting to eat. Our waitress wasn't very friendly and didn't seem to be willing to get me more to drink, no water for me I see....

Nothing fabulous but not bad either... 

Service needs some help...."}
{"text":"Bought a voucher on amazon local to give it a go.  Decor was not the finest, bathroom floor was dirty but service was excellent and accomodating and sushi was quite good.  I look forward to coming back with friends!"}
{"text":":( So sad about my two-star rating... This used to be one of my favorites spots to eat. They have delicious Korean BBQ and they offer combination meals that include about 6-8 sizzling plates that is shareable for a big group. Service was quick and always accommodated us. But slowly things went downhill; they started cutting down on portion sizes and charging for extra things, like substitutions and RICE! Recently they have expanded to next door and added a sushi bar and karaoke rooms. I have yet to try either of those, but my suggestion would be to soundproof those karaoke rooms! Diners in the restaurant can hear it all, good or bad :X Guess I'll need to start looking for a new KBBQ place around Phoenix to get my fix!"}
{"text":"all u can eat was rip off. it took almost 45mins to bring out the first order and only have 2 hours limite time. very bad experience."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food, the waiter/cashier is very polite! This is my default place to go for Korean food. Go for the their lunch specials, super cheap and filling!"}
{"text":"I had a far better experience eating here the other day than my first visit a couple of years ago... This place is pretty small, maybe about ten tables that can seat 4-6 people but I didn't feel cramped at all so that was cool. Be prepared for a little bit of a wait as the few times I've been here there's been only one person tending to everyone.

I ordered a spicy beef stew dish that was freakin' excellent, totally hit the spot! Just don't come here super hungry because your stew will come out to you still bubbling hot in one of those soup stone bowls. I was much happier with this dish than the galbi and katsu dishes I've had here before, so I'm definitely sticking to the stew next time I come here!"}
{"text":"\"Meh.\"

This place expanded, right? Same, familiar furniture which is perfectly fine but the floors have already seen better days.

Lunch specials are reasonable. We went here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Lunch was alright. Dinner prices will at least double for you. They have a happy hour all day thing going on for now. I ordered some sushi. I wanted to try a couple so I ordered some cheaper ones, like salmon (a classic fave for me) and a california. 

The weirdest tasting sushi ever. I have never seen a more disappointed-looking salmon roll. It is literally just a teeny bit of salmon wrapped around some rice. It is.. the size of the thumb. California rolls are really ubiquitous and so you don't expect much. But this is beyond that. I couldn't taste anything. I clearly see the avocado but nothing came through. Also, if the restaurant is reading this, get rid of the sesame seeds that the rolls are rolled in. It is so overpowering. So.. if you're ordering sushi, get the more fancy/expensive rolls.

I didn't have much of an appetite so I got something small, pork belly and mushroom skewers. Don't do it. As soon as I saw it, I felt like a total idiot. It's thin cuts of pork that tasted burnt and salty and small, small mushrooms. What is the point of skewering.

Boyfriend ordered an actual entree, beef teriyaki. I wished they didn't cook it so far because it kept on cooking on that sizzling plate and it got a bit tough but was still pretty good. The teriyaki sauce was good but thickened rather quickly. 

I know most Asian restaurants charge for extra rice, but being Asian and growing up eating nothing but it, it annoys me to pay extra for a little bowl of rice to accompany even half the size of the dinner. I'll do it, though, but I get even more annoyed (?!) when that tiny, palm sized bowl is only half full.

Waitresses were OK. Not terrible. All three stood around chatting and texting so it felt like you were interrupting social time when you needed something.

I promise, I'm not a terrible, mean person :) 

Wow, long review but I won't be coming back."}

Right now they have a great dinner special with both bulgogi and sushi! 
Their lunch specials are pretty awesome too.  

The only reason I wouldn't give this a 5 is that the service tends to be a little slow (though overall not bad)."}

To top it off, we told them we had a groupon when we sat down. Then we double confirmed that our food choices were groupon appropriate. Then when we went to pay - magically the groupon policy had changed. Our food was no longer covered. This would be a single star review if not for the great service from our server who really worked hard to overcome our disappointment."}

Ohya, Ohya Ohya, Ohya! Ohya, Ohya! Ohya!
Ohya, Ohya Ohya, Ohya! Ohya, Ohya! Ohya!

Up in the bar with my homies, trying get some Korean Seafood Tofu soupy
cause you know how it is
I saw some kimchi was tasting how spicy?
from the smell it was kicking in my nose

you would think that it kill me
so I decided to chill
Tofu soup is spicy, it got my head feeling like it was ready to blow!
I'm saying \"It's spicy! It's spicy!\"

So I had to get some water to cleanse the palate, and said \"man, that felt good\"
That's when I yelped and reviewed
Ohya, Ohya!

Ohya was originally CJB, another Korean BBQ Joint. Name changed so I gather the owners changed too. At a Korean BBQ joint what else do we order; of course Korean BBQ and some Tofu soup! We ordered the Galbi and it was nicely roasted with some onions. Just the right amount of char and seasoning. Yum!

However, my favorite Korean cuisine is the Seafood Tofu Soup. I can't say it's my favorite here, but it's alright. I need it to be spicy, but not overdone; and super hot in temperature. I need it to scorch my tongue! The smell itself needs to be pungent and the egg visible. Needless to say, it didn't pass my test, but gets an okay. Moreover, the side dishes weren't that great here. Kimchi here is pretty good, but that's about it. Didn't care for the steamed napa cabbage or bean sprouts.
Service is on top of things. They do a great job and are very attentive. Overall, the experience of the place is decent and nothing too spectacular. If you need a quick Korean bite and taste then you gotta do what you gotta do! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch the other day.    I must admit, I have not found a good sushi/Japanese food restaurant on the \"west side\" till now.   Therefore, when my companion suggested it, I went there with trepidation but thought, \"What the heck.   Why not?\"

I had the six-piece chef's choice nigiri and he had one of the rolled sushis, which I can't remember the name, but, you know, typical rolled sushi, which, if you have read my prior reviews on sushi, I don't really care for rolled sushi that is mixed with heaven knows what.   I did try it, and noticed it had cream cheese in it.   REALLY??  Cream cheese in sushi??   He also ordered the shrimp tempura appetizer, which I found quite good.   The batter was light and fluffy and not overwhelmingly batter and one has to play, \"Where's the shrimp?!\"

My nigiri was good.   It was a fine selection of \"chef's choice\" as far as the product.  For $9, it was a screaming deal.   It came with the six pieces of nigiri, rolled sushi, a salad, and miso soup.   Quite filling for a lunch.   Too bad they don't have a closer location.   I would definitely frequent it more often."}

We usually order a bulgogi & a brisket with a crispy tuna roll  my favorite!

{"text":"affordable korean food. it's not the best, but the prices are awesome in comparison with most other korean restaurants. 
The combos are a good start if it's your first venture into korean food, although I will say that if you really like spicy spicy food, ask them to make the soondubu (tofu stew) spicy! it's really mild, and while it isn't my fave soondubu, it's pretty good. I usually get the galbi/soondubu combo. Their galbi tang (beef short rib soup) is also pretty good, and is CHEAP at $8 (usually 10+ at other places). 

Anyways, for all you ASU West students, I'd recommend coming here for the lunch specials (11am-3pm)."}
{"text":"I think they are under staffed. The servers are always not there when you need them.

But it's Korean BBQ and there's not that many of them around here. We got one of the combos and it was around $35 for 2 people. Comparable to what you can find in California except for 1 thing. It's not all you can eat. It's just one plate of meat.

Having experienced what awesome AYCE Korean BBQ is ranging from $9.99 to $19.99, I say this place is no good given the amount of meat and the lack of service.

Given that AZ has nothing besides 3 to 4 Korean BBQ places in the entire valley area that spans an hour drive from one end to the other, this is ok. But probably not worth your money.

I didn't try their sushi or their karaoke service but I'm sure one day, I will."}
{"text":"Food was great tasting and comes in great qualities. Cool atmosphere. Service was nothing to complain about. Had a vegas roll, hawiian roll, bulgoki, black bran paste noodles, and yellow tail sashimi. Soju and sake bombs to drink. Happy hour all day everyday. Loved it. Not 5 stars due to nothing being perfect. I recommend"}
{"text":"The seafood pancake mainly consisted of green onions. We counted, and there we only perhaps 2 pieces of octopus/squid. 

Go to Gogi on the east valley of AZ. Their seafood pancake is the same price $10 and it is HUGE with LOTS of seafood.

Service is a-okay."}
{"text":"My fabulous friend Kira decided to treat me to some Korean BBQ. I am not one to turn down food plus I was excited to go as I had been wanting to try  this place. We got there pretty early, which is good because by the time we left, there wasn't a seat to be had. The its a pretty small place, with a total of 8 tabletop cook spots and three that are not. 

We started off with these firecracker rolls which was a stuffed jalapeno popper with crab meat. They were so good that once we were done with dinner, we order another order of them.  We ordered the BBQ combo # 2 Galbi, Bulgogi, Daeji Bulgogi, which was Short ribs, beef and spicy pork. It comes with a various sides for you to nibble on when your meat is done or while you are waiting for it to be done. 

All in all it was a lot of fun. We got to cook our own meat at the table top. The Pork was a little more fatty than we would have liked, but not bad at all. We left out of there full and smelling like BBQ since you are up close and personal. I have a restaurant.com coupon so I will be coming back here again soon."}
{"text":"Some of the best Korean food I've had east of LA! Me and my boyfriend decided to check this out after reading the reviews here and I am so glad we did.
 
I ordered the galbi dohlsot bibambap and kimchi pa jun, and he got the daeji bulgogi and pork tofu soup. I've had all the dishes before and I have to say they were all very good! the kimchi pa jun was definitely the star of the meal for me. The bibambap was very good (I really liked that they included egg, not all places do), but I can definitely say that my favorite restaurant in LA had better, same with the daeji bulgogi (I actually think that Cafe Ga Hyang over on Olive and 43rd Ave had a better daeji bulgogi - more expensive but a lot more meat, and they didn't skimp on the sauce/marinade, which I felt they did here a little bit). They also didn't serve complimentary barley tea with the meal which was not a huge deal but I always enjoy having it with my Korean food. Price was very good too, only about $40 for a rather large amount of food. If we'd gone for lunch it would've been pretty cheap, from what I could see from their lunch specials, so I'll definitely be going back for that! Service was very quick, and I enjoyed the variety of Korean tv programs they had. 

All in all, not comparing to food I've eaten in koreatown, it was a delicious filling meal and fulfilled my korean food craving and then some. Definitely recommend it!  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  It's the best Korean food I have had on the West side of the valley."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Very nice and hip but relaxed atmosphere. Really well put together. I think they are either remodeling a part of the building or extending it either way it didn't ruin the experience. I didn't give it a five because other places are a little less expensive for happy hour sushi."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and two out of the three times the service was TERRIBLE, I mean terrible. It took around 5-8 mins just to be greeted and sat at a table, and then another 15 mins just for our server to acknowledge us, and get our drink orders, we saw her tending to all her other tables and she had walked past us about 5 times until I finally got up and asked the hostess what was going on, as we have not even seen our waitress. I've had this same experience TWO times both of which they were not really busy which makes it worse.. No apology either for making us wait nearly 20 mins just to get some waters, which is why I'm giving this place 3 out of 5 stars. 

I have not actually tried the Korean BBQ yet as I feel like it's something that should be done with a good group and normally my boyfriend and I just come here as it's so close, the food that we have tried is always delicious, I just wish the service was better as that's the only thing at this point that is making me not want to come back."}
{"text":"Never have I ever thought I would find authentic Korean Galbi in Arizona! It was a little burnt, but I am guessing the burn was from grill. Galbi sauce was about perfect, with about right amount of sweetness. Totally worth the 30 minute driving."}
{"text":"I love Korean food, and this place was fresh, plentiful, and the service was excellent. A bit of a bar vibe, but the food is great."}
{"text":"I came here with my preceptor to celebrate my last day. I was excited because they had bibim  bap. I really wanted bulgogi but it didn't come in a hot stone bowel or with cooked veggies so I ended up ordering something else. I was really disappointed about this. We both ended up ordering the bibim bap with the short rib. While we waited for food, the waitress brought out the typical pickled small dishes with sprouts, kimchi, etc. That was good. 

When the bowels came out, the food was piping hot with the raw egg cracked on top which what I wanted. The bowl is deep. The meat looked like it was slightly skimped on but I don't know if it is because they take the bones out of the ribs. I prefer my meat bring left on the bone. I mixed my bowel up with the sweet red sauce they give you on the side. There is a good amount of veggies, but I was noticing I wasn't super excited about the veggies in the bowel. It was thinly sliced carrots, beam sprouts, a dark green that appeared to be spinach maybe, and a long brown chewy veggie which I thoight was a root or a sprout of some sort. I was disappointed that there wasn't any cucumber or kimchi or any other more crunchy component in the dish. The meat itself didn't have a really delicious short rib flavor either it just was okay. The texture of the meat was good though; it was tender. Overall, the bowel was okay. I have definitely had way better bowels elsewhere. 

Service was good though and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times since the last review.  The place is still the same.  Love there lunch specials.  We got bulgogi & soft tofu soup; bulgogi bowl, udon with tempura, and yakisoba.  

Service was great, food was great, and would recommend this place for Korean food!!!"}
{"text":"We love coming here for AYCE Korean bbq! Such a good deal and there aren't very many places in AZ that have good quality grill it yourself kbbq. Their tofu soup is also bomb. It gets pretty busy at night so prepare yourself for that. The server Kelly is my absolute favorite and we go back just to be able to see her!"}
{"text":"The service was good, I just thought that the food had very little taste. My bill was 50 Dollars and believe me it was not worth it. Here is a GREAT! KOREAN BBQ, a little pricey but its well worth it. I'm sticking with Cafe Ga Hyang"}
{"text":"Since my last review over 3 years ago, this place has a whole new look and vibe. It's more than twice as big as it used to be with a more hangout/ bar atmosphere. There are a lot more younger staff working here- not sure if it has new owners. I like all the changes. The other night I came here late with my son and it was great since they are open until late. Their menu is varied and extensive. If you don't find something that suits your taste buds then I think you must be an extremely picky eater!
My son and I had the bulgogi with four side dishes, six pieces of sushi ($14.95) plus a California roll ($3.95). Plenty of food for 2 people with leftovers. 
The waitress was super friendly and took a liking to my son so she couldn't stop smiling when she came over. Which is great cause a smile goes a long way under any occasion!
The place reminds of a LA joint now for both old, young, bar, non-bar going crowd alike. I like it. I hope it does well and become more and more successful as the city grows!"}
{"text":"One of the few places where you can BBQ your own food. But the vibe of the place speaks to sushi lovers as well. I wish it would just stick to one or the other. Had a great experience here nonetheless. Ordered the combo with pork belly, beef and thinly sliced brisket. Would recommend coming on Tuesday when it's all you can eat. Otherwise it's pricey to order your meats individually. Great selection of Soju and Korean beer. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Sushi: Very good tasting, normal price, good quality. Alaskan, Rainbow, and Dragon were the ones I tried. They tasted amazing.

Drinks: Lots of beers, Sake, and others. Good prices. 

Service: Not too good. Waited a very very long time for food, receipt, etc. 

Overall, a slight improvement in their speed would push this up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"My co workers and I go here at least 3-4 times week and we LOVE it. Whether they are serving a large or small party of people  they always serve our food quickly. the sushi is delicious and there many other entrees as well. Everything here is reasonably price. We typically stay here any where form 1-3 hours at a time. I absolutely adore Simon and Kassie as waiters. I will more then likely be here tomorrow or the next day and many more after!"}
{"text":"Long story short if you want cheap representation of Korean, Chinese or Japanese come here."}
{"text":"I don't know if I'm just spoiled by all the sushi bar competition in the SF Bay Area but I was shocked by the shittty service at this place. I sit down at the sushi bar and get ignored, IGNORED by the sushi chef. I had to ask for a menu and the and to order, and for the check. Everything took forever to come out, I guess they get to decide the order that I eat my meal. If you are desperate the food tastes good but the service is a deal breaker for me. Never again."}
{"text":"Decent food and great service. I ordered the Dubokki and it had no flavor except spicy. My soon dubu was pretty good. Limited side dishes. Seems like it would be nice if I ordered maybe Kbbq."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for the first time because we had a groupon. I am so happy I found this place!!! We only ate sushi so I cant speak for the meals. The sushi was awesome, fresh taste, unique rolls, and huge portions! At first we thought it seemed pricey but after seeing how big the rolls were it was definitely a good deal. 
The only reason I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 star rating is because the service was just so so; we were one of 4 tables (at 3pm) and it just took a little longer than we would have liked to get our order taken or to get our food. 
We will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch as a first timer. Looks sketch out front (the printer home made signs don't help), but once you walk inside you quickly realize a place like this is more suitable for Scottsdale with a trendy urban feel. Ordered the Black Bean Noodles and some awesome cold sake at the suggestion of my waitress Kelly, and wow. This dish alone will bring me back, but the great sake selection and prices don't hurt at all. 

It won't be for everyone, and isl ikely more popular with younger crowds with broader tastes. I assume it helps being a cross the street from ASU. Although I woudnt bring mom for dinner, I'd sure as heck come here for a fun energetic environment where K-Pop and Asian rap is always playing.

I didn't have any sushi, but honestly wouldn't come here for that anyways since the Korean food seems legit. 

Keep it up, and thanks Kelly."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Korean BBQ, Japanese dishes, ALL the sushi rolls. Private karaoke rooms just like in Asia! Hubby and I had a roll, poke salad, edamame, and crab stuffed jalapeños. YUM! Can't believe I had never been here and so close to home!"}
{"text":"I went to OHYA with my boyfriend, mostly because I like Japanese and Korean food and they serve both!

I decided on one of the specials that included a meat choice and 2 regular sushi rolls or 6 nagiri. I got the bulgogi for my meat choice, then s spicy tuna roll and a California roll. We also ordered the vegetable tempura as an appetizer.  Everything I put in my mouth that night was super yummy! I hadn't had any Asian food for a while and OHYA really hit the spot!

Just writing this review made me crave them, so I'll definitely be going back again soon to try some other wonderfully sounding option on their menu!"}
{"text":"The fact that they are the only all-U-can-eat Korean BBQ in Phoenix, they deserve 4 stars for being brave. All other Korean restaurant overcharged you but these guys are very reasonable at 20 bucks. I wish they would do this for all days instead of just mon to wed. The only other thing is a good vinegary type sauce. You can also do a half order if you are afraid of wasting food. Waitress super nice. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"I came here expecting an experience similar to Gyu Kaku which are in California but not here in Arizona.

What I got in comparison to my expectations was...awkward.

The service was awkward, the preparation was awkward, the taste was a little awkward but nobody got sick and most of it was pretty good but the price was high.

Not awful at all, but did just did not meet my expectations in a great many ways. I might go back perhaps to try the sushi instead of the KBBQ, everything was just really incredibly average.
The karaoke rooms did look pretty cool though."}
{"text":"Ok so this is my third time there. First time AMAZING CASSEROLE dish! Loved so much I rented the Karaoke room for my team and had a blast. Third time tried the all you can eat BBQ. We were three people and they portion the same amount regardless of party size since couples next were getting same amounts but 3 people eat faster and more than two so we found ourselves waiting quite a bit for them to come offer more meat. There is a 90 min limit on all you can eat  and we were able to barely get two deliveries of food because the waitress hardly came around and this was BEFORE the rush. Turned out expensive for what we actually got and joked about getting something to eat on way home. It seems they control how much you actually eat by not coming around. Left bad taste in our mouths! And I talked this place up soooo much. Ughhhhh"}
{"text":"Love this place, one of my favorite westside Korean places. The staff is very friendly and helpful. My favorite order is the hot pot and daeji bulgogi. The daeji is slightly spicier not too much and it gets a nice char on the hot plate. All of the soft tofu soups are great. My favorite is the gut stew, maybe not for everybody but if you've had pho it's the same stuff. My friend orders it and just picks out the intestines it's that good. They also have Korean beer, Cass, which I find superior to all Japanese beers. The only thing I'm not in love with is the sushi. It's not bad but their signature rolls are kind of meh. Come here for the Korean food not the sushi."}
{"text":"Bad service upon arrival. Stood at the front waiting to be seated for 5 minutes without acknowledgement. No waters were given for at least 5 mins past seating. The lady who seated us was very rude when asking for what to drink and no straws were provided. We waited 10 minutes with no straws so decided to grab them ourselves at the sushi bar. 

Once our server came, the service did get better. Our server was very consistent in asking if we were okay and if we needed anything. 

The food was delicious! We ordered the #5 combo as well as a plate of clear noodles. We decided to cook our meal ourselves and enjoyed our dinner. 

5 stars for the food and 3 stars for the service"}
{"text":"I have been to many Korean bbq restaurants. This place can be a pretty cool place for date nights or if you want to hangout with your friends and sing karaoke. The staffs are super friendly and they make sure to check up on you often to see if everything is okay. I like meat, they have meat. The food is pretty decent/good, depending on what you get. I don't always drink but when I do, I prefer more on the menu. Stay thirsty my friends."}
{"text":"It's the closest Korean place that I could find here in Glendale. 
Lunch during the week is super cheap and well worth it. 
I think the pre-cooked meats (both kalbi and bulgogi) are dry and taste like they have been cooked earlier in the day. 
Tofu soup is always good even though I like cracking my own egg in it. hah
The Pa jun was my favorite, because it had scallop, calamari, clams, and even shrimp! 

Overall, I'll give it 4 stars, but I'm being really generous here. 
(mainly because I'm korean)"}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner with my tripe,gut and vegetable soup that came sizzling in a hot stone bowl. Also the other dishes were very good. My daughter spent 3 years in South Korea and said this was as close as she remembered. Along with some pork belly, bulgogi and Bi bim bap it was so good we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. My boyfriend and I visit here at least twice a week. We have only eaten off of the sushi menu and love it. We gave introduced friends here that have returned for the Korean bbq and state that it is some of the best they have had. An absolute must try is the hamachi popper- we also really like the crispy tuna. Price is great on sushi is excellent. If you don't have a groupon make sure to order on their happy hour side- there is no time frame on happy hour menu...if u want Korean bbq maybe go to groupon"}
{"text":"The Tuesday all you can eat Korean BBQ and sushi is the best!!! Friendly staff and short lines, every time I've been here there was never a wait which I would think is a bad thing but I think it's just a place that has not been discovered yet, bc the food is very good. One thing I will say is the chicken katsu is very dry but other than that I really enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"After a looooong day at the lake, shopping, and movies, my friends and I had dinner here. They had all you can eat that day for $23 & the BBQ was really yummy. I found the sushi display really nice too! They also have karaoke rooms"}
{"text":"I am far from expert in this field of  sushi but I've tried a fair amount at a fair number of places, and I thought this was exceptional. I already liked the Korean food at the predecessor C J B Korean establishment and now I have a new favorite place for sushi as well.  

Black suspended tile ceilings with dark concrete floors, walls of bright green and some modern oriental art in between. Slightly spare, clean, modern feel to the place.  Men's room was spotlessly clean, modern with up to date fixtures, stocked with all the necessities. 

Our young server was friendly and attentive and our water glasses never went dry - except when I bumblingly knocked mine over, which was taken in stride by staff, and quickly replaced with a fresh glass. Service, from being seated, to order taking, to delivery food, to delivery of the check, involved no undue delays.  In fact, as Norm R noted,  service was almost too efficient as servers were anxious to whisk away our plates almost before we cleared them, but I'll take that over that experienced by another reviewer any day.

Now as to the FOOD, Excellent in every way.  Beautifully presented, multiple distinct flavors. Best shumai ever tasted. Tongue tantalizing tuna tataki, rich, red, flavorful, and our accidental order, the \"OhYa I Forgot\", was a definite \"no regrets\", the closest thing to a dessert sushi I've ever encountered with its touch of peach.  

And finally, we didn't go away hungry, indeed as one should not from a $65 + tip meal for two, but you need not spend nearly so much.  There are considerably reduced happy hour prices and several \"chef's surprise\" samplers at under $20. 

The service we received was \"comfortable\", perhaps more friendly than polished, and that's just fine by me.  I highly recommend with the hope the service you receive is as good as we got, and not the indifference experienced by another recent reviewer below."}
{"text":"I came in tonight with a friend. It was his first time at the restaurant. I had the same great server that I had the last time I was here. She was friendly and brought our drinks out very quickly. I ordered the tootsie roll and my friend ordered the eel cucumber roll. The food came out in a timely manner.  Both were delicious. The food was so good, we ordered more. The server came back to refill our drinks.  We ordered another eel cucumber roll and an order of tuna sashimi. Again, the food came out in a timely manner. My friend was very happy with the food and for such a great price. I always leave full and happy. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"love going here. the $4.95 bulggogi lunch special is the cheapest and most satisfying lunch special I've ever found at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there for AYCE because the Owner posted that it was available everyday just 2 months ago. It's only AYCE mon-wed.  added a star for the free soda they gave us before we left. Lol thanks"}
{"text":"Came here with the whole family to celebrate 4th of July, didn't let know down like always. And as for a Korean restaurant their price is not that crazy. So it makes me like here even more."}
{"text":"Really good Korean bbq. Good atmosphere, especially with the kpop. I always get the brisket and bulgogi. It is always fun to cook your own food."}
{"text":"this place i came because it was the only kbbq in town but tonight it will be my last. customer service is what I spend my money on. no service, no money, no more. if you know me, then you know. if you have to go fetch your server to get serve, then come here."}
{"text":"Love the food, great service. Will definitely eat here again! Wait or gave great suggestions on what to order!"}
{"text":"First timer here. First of all my family makes very good Korean bbq so I was intrigued how this worked. I'd say it's a great experience. Idk if I would come back though. It might have been something to do at least once in your life or if you're in that kind of thing. Maybe it was because our table was so tiny for a table for 5? There were no room for our food. It was fun but the food was mediocre, including sushi. It seems kinda pricy too for cooking it ourselves. Idk I've had better in Cali. Our server was good and kept asking if we need anything but I think she came up to our table a little too many times. Super nice though."}
{"text":"Food was good; went with a group and everyone tried something different. We all enjoyed the dinner and all the appetizers. I had the shashimi combo and it was delicious. It appears that they are newly owned and redecorating. The service was good; very attentive and friendly.  They have some work to do before the restaurant atmosphere is nice, the bathroom really needed cleaned and these two items are the reason for it not getting a five star."}
{"text":"Ok, I love this place!! 5 stars it gets. I love the hours and the food and the service. Where's my thumbs up emoji? 
It's been so busy recently too- but luckily we can still be seated pretty quickly. I love the loud noise of people buzzing and the Korean music blasting (they're like new songs too!)"}
{"text":"I found out about this place via a Groupon offer. Walked into the relatively small dining area with my wife and the food appeared to look good.  Unfortunately after standing around in the dining area for several minutes being ignored by the four workers on duty, with not even a quick \"Hi, we'll be with you in a few minutes\", we did an about face and left.  We walked over to an adjacent restaurant Pho Avina and had great service and very good Vietnamese food.

So my summary is that the food might be fine, but the service probably would be an issue.  Sometimes customer service is king and hopefully this restaurant will learn this."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi spot! I love the atmosphere and the delicious options. I will say that sometimes their service is lacking, there are a few waitresses that are a little rude, but you can put them in their place and enjoy your time :) not to mention, karaoke room!"}
{"text":"This is only place you can get Korean style fried chicken in AZ. But you have to wait long time for that. Otherwise it tastes so good. Especially the Korean bbq flavor!"}
{"text":"Nice fun atmosphere, good fresh food, and delicious kimchee. Seriously what else do you need besides the kimchee?  Definitely recommend it just know that, when it's busy you need to practically tackle the staff to get their attention. Otherwise, sake bomb away."}
{"text":"Amazing food and good prices definitely recommend, 
My favorite sushi bar in Phoenix 
Keep up the good work and service OHYA"}
{"text":"Love the sushi and the service!! My husband and I bought a groupon for $9.00 for $20.00 worth of sushi. I would recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, went on a night they were offering all you can eat.  It's a fairly complex system of all you can eat.  It's based on the number of people eating that determines the # of selections at a time and then there are only X number of rounds (Sushi, I believe it's 4 and Korean BBQ it's 3...but don't hold me to that).  The food was ok, my biggest concern was the raw meat they bring to you with only one set of tongs.  Personally that's a health hazard, thank the stars we got an extra set of chopsticks.  As for the taste, everything was seasoned/marinated well.  The sushi was fairly decent (that's why I raised their stars to 3.  It's worth it to try on their all you can eat nights, just to try the various meats.  The service was good too, our waitress was really patient as we tried to figure it all out and was helpful.  I'd go back, just not on an all you can eat night.  The restaurant itself is fairly dark but nicely maintained and modern."}
{"text":"My fiance and I just dined here and thought it was great! Our server Sammie was an absolute delight. She was super friendly with great and quick service. Pricing here for sushi is extremely competitive and portions were excellent. We ordered 4 rolls and shared them for more variety. I only rated 4 stars because i wasnt very fond of the \"ohya i forgot\" or the \"spider\" roll. They didnt have much flavor. The vegas roll is a staple among sushi and they had one of the best ones I've tried. The volcano roll was also amazing... A hot roll that was melt in your mouth goodness. They even created a volcano out of orange peels and lit it on fire as they served it to your table... An awesome touch! I would definitely recommend and visit again!!"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Arizona in August, I have been a loyal customer. I used to dine in/take out at least one a week. This was before their recent expansion, which includes a sushi bar and karaoke rooms. 

The amount of food used to match the price. The ingredients and flavors were fairly representative of authentic Korean food. When I ordered take out, they would pack the boxes to the brim. I'd have to be careful opening the container because it was just that full. Not only was the soup abundant, but the meat to tofu ratio meant more meat than tofu. They would also pack the side dish containers to the brim.

But since their renovation, I've noticed a decrease in their customer service. It takes a while for them to jot down your order when you dine in, which is understandable when they're busy. (But this is a red flag that they need to begin redoing their training so that the waiters and chefs know how to handle a larger crowd.) 

When I order take out, they only fill the containers about 1/2-3/4ths full. There are more \"filler\" ingredients now. Any order with noodles means more noodles and less meat. Orders of meat have been about 4 pieces of galbi (for example), and the rest of the container is filled with onions, whereas I used to receive 8-9 pieces. They even changed their container boxes from the long rectangular boxes that was specifically for the meat, to small square boxes that also hold rice. Rice portions have decreased to a small handful as opposed to two to three large handfuls. Soup orders are 3/4ths full, with minimal stock and chunks of tofu. More than half the container is tofu at this point. And the most noticeable change in service is their substitution of actual pork meat for bacon. Because bacon comes with its own flavor, this changes the taste of the soup and noodle dishes, which compromises the authentic Korean flavor.

I am just thoroughly disappointed at the service and the lack of care for quality [ingredients] by this restaurant as I was a customer before they made these decisions. I wouldn't be as disappointed if they didn't also increase their prices. I understand that making a profit is important, but undercutting the quality to increase the gap between cost of goods and goods sold is not the way to proceed.

Sadly, I will no longer be returning to OhYa to get my Korean fix."}
{"text":"I had two different rolls as well as a deep fried jalapeno, and all were just \"meh\".  I had take-out and tried to use a groupon, but they wouldn't let me, saying it was for dine-in only even though the groupon didn't specify that.  The rolls had almost no flavor and the jalapeno had the taste of being deep fried about an hour before I ate it.  Overall, disappointing experience.  And I still have the groupon. :("}
{"text":"Average Korean food.  We ordered the Kalbi, Spicy Octopus, and Bi Bim Bap.  The Kalbi was good--well flavored and juicy, but I have never been to a restaurant where you had to pay extra for the lettuce, garlic, and bean paste to roll up the kalbi.  The octopus was super tough, which I realized later, must have meant that it was frozen before preparation.  The Bi Bim Bap came without rice, which I had never seen, and barely covered the bottom of the bowl."}
{"text":"We've been going to Ohya every other week or so for the past 3 years so I can say we are regulars. This used to be me and my friends' spot for Korean food but for the past few months, the food, the staff and our over all experience went downhill. 

Last night I think is the worst experience we've had. Su was our server, the place is about 60% busy, she and Kelly and another busser was there attending but it seemed like service was very slow. 

We ordered the Bulgogi and Tofu Soup Regular Spicy combo, the brisket meal and asked for more sides.  The bulgogi came out dry and bland, and the most frustrating part was our soup. It felt like we were served spicy, hot water with orange food coloring with meat in it. We had to tell our server and she took it back to the kitchen and she said she will get us another one. And then 20 minutes later, we followed up with her and she said \"it's coming.\" Another 10 minutes, our friends were done eating, and still no soup so we told Su that we were just gonna pay for the bulgogi and to just cancel the soup because we've been waiting for half an hour and already lost our appetite. She answered back \"but it's ready!\" and insisted that we take it into a to go box but we refused because got frustrated with her attitude and lost interest in the soup. 

It took her another 15 minutes to run our payment and to get a glass of water. 

I think this place just needs more training on how to treat customers and have some consistency when it comes to how they cook their food. I really wish this restaurant would improve because it does have a lot of potential and we really like the Tofu Soup a lot!"}
{"text":"This place is not bad. I visited this place before they changed over. I am glad they changed over. its a lot cooler of a place. When we went, I guess one of their servers called out sick.. Thank God. I would have not been happy if my server was hacking up a lung. 

Bad thing about that situation was it was one server that night. Poor lady was running around. There were some loud annoying and rude people there. I am sure the server felt overwhelmed.

We will come back, but if it looks like the same situation we might go else where instead of trying to wade through that nonsense again."}
{"text":"This place was awesome when they first opened. Not so much anymore. It seems like the food grade goes down everytime I go there. 

Last time I went was in September 2009. side of rice I got was spoiled. Like rice smelled like fermented bean. Most of the side dishes tasted on the berge of spoiling too. 

I loved it because it was closer to where I live, but now I have to drive further away to get good korean food. it's shame. They stopped delivery service too..."}
{"text":"Love love love! Very friendly, willing to deal with picky eaters, and such a good vibe to the place.
 I ordered takeout but had to wait a few for my sushi. The woman there offered me a seat and a glass of water which I thought was so so sweet. She helped me get rolls I would like (very picky/allergic to certain things) and I got the best sushi I've ever had! 
It's not too expensive- it's very vegetarian friendly as well. It's right by my home so I'll definitely be going more often. 
(Also, if you're choosing between here and pho avina- go here. They're much nicer and more willing to help!)"}
{"text":"I love coming here with friends for their all you can eat Korean BBQ and Sushi on Tuesday and Thursday nights. It is a must try if you are feeling adventurous"}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome I don't know where else you can go to get such great food so late! Wide variety, great service, food was awesome, drinks were great, ambiance was beautiful. HIGHLY RECOMMEND CHECKING IT OUT!!!!"}
{"text":"We will be back for sure!  This is the kind of Korean BBQ restaurant that I know and love (unlike the one we went to a few weeks ago). All the meats were well seasoned, the sides were very tasty (my faves were the cucumber salad and the lettuce), and the service was great. Not only did we find good Korean BBQ, they have good sushi too!  It's 45 minutes from our house, but it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this a 3 star because the food did come out quickly! Otherwise it would be a 2! The server was completely rude to us when we're were deciding which combo to go with! He was impatient and RUDE! I will never return again! The portions were smaller and not very many sides!!! Terrible!"}
{"text":"Umm where do i begin. Well ita ok, food taste real good but prices r outrageous. I ordered the galbi beef n it cost me $24 bucks, so not worth the price it tasted great but the portion was not enough at least not for that price. Damn i so miss california. Not sure ill come bak, but i wont knock it it is a nice place n they have good food. Just not enough for meeee. Over priced if u ask mee. Im gonna elsewhere after just to fulfill my hunger, so sad!!"}
{"text":"So I wasn't hungry at all.when my friends decided to get a quick bite to eat before going home last night around 10pm. They have a couple karaoke rooms good for groups. I looked at their menu and they have some great prices especially since they have happy hour like all day. Like I said, I wasn't very hungry but the food looked delicious enough to try. 

Our server was also great she was super friendly and joked around with our group. I'll have to come back with a bigger apprtite. It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the food, drinks & staff are amazing. Treat me and my friends, who I bring with almost every week, like family :)"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD! The service was wonderful.  We ordered the bbq and the servers helped us cook the food.  It was a great value for the amount of food they give you.  I loved the Chap Chae and the tofu soup was awesome too.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean restaurant in Phoenix!

I always get their lunch box special because it's inexpensive but incredibly good quality. I come here at least once every two weeks!

Their Daeji Bulgogi is so delicious and every time that I eat it my taste buds become very happy. It is their best dish that they offer.

Their sushi as well is exquisitely made. It's also very good. It's never dry, always fresh. I feel their sushi is such high quality that it could compete with or even beat places like Stingray Sushi.

They also just remodeled their restaurant to have a sushi bar along with karaoke rooms!

This is simply the best Korean restaurant around. They're consistent with service and quality. Never once has food ever been delivered that was less than perfect.

They also do to-go orders which can be a quick fix for people on the move!

Overall, I would give this place 5/5 stars. If you're looking for something new that is the next big thing, then come here! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went in for there all you can eat bbq and sushi, and in case anyone is wondering since it isn't posted anywhere that I could find its 24.95.  The meat was fresh and amazing, the sushi was also really good best Vegas rolls I've ever had the service was great really friendly staff as well as good atmosphere.  My only complaint is that they give you so much food there isn't enough  room on the table"}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon and had a terrible experience. 

After waiting 15 min for a table to open up, waited another 10 for menus, flagged down the waitress, asked for water, waited another 10 for water, she shoved water glasses on our table, left, waved her down, said she'd be right over, she seated, menu-ed, and watered a group of four that had just arrived. 

With the already horrendous service, we figured service would be faster if we ordered items we could cook on the table top. When we the food arrived, we received only two sets of dishes and silverware for 4 people.

The remainder of our meal, our server never stopped by, after trying to wave her down for one thing after another, I resorted to going behind the counter myself, even taking their water pitcher to refill our waters."}
{"text":"The service is suck. I tipped over 35% the first several times I went in and they didn't even remember me, hmm. Then they brought me out the wrong food and didn't even fix it, hahaha! Okay, regular 15-20% for you!

Okay, so let me put that aside and say, cook the food yourself. The BBQ combos are great. I love the green onion salad it is so addictive and so amazing and I could probably eat pounds of it. It's lame that they charge more for basically everything but it's a nice place to go, and I believe they use a few pieces of charcoal in with the gas grill adding extra flavor. 

The restaurant itself is very small, but if you're a nerd check out the gaming store on the same block. They've got magic, board games and warhammer."}
{"text":"We walked in and the waitress walked by without acknowledging us or saying someone will be here to help us. We waited three or four minutes before we were shown to our table. When we sat down, it took a while for someone to come see us. We had questions since we were not from Arizona...and thought this was an ayce kbbq. So finally someone comes to ask if we would like water and told us there are no ayce kbbq on the weekend....you would think that it would have been listed on their board at the front or on their menu....because quite frankly I think that's where announcements are made about their specials in regards to food and/or drinks....? Terrible service and unprofessional. Mind you, we stopped by their other location since their hours stated they were opened. Well no signs of explanation, just that the doors were locked and lights were off. So here, we just got up and left since we came for ayce and it was not being served. We will never come back because we've been to enough restaurants to know what we would be willing to pay for."}
{"text":"Ok...was brought here by a Groupon that my wife bought..and didn't get a chance to even use it.lol.more on that later!

I probably would have never came here if it wasn't for the Groupon but I'm very glad I did. Haven't been to a Korean BBQ in years..so I was completely lost. Ended up ordering the chicken, pork, steak combo and started off with a rainbow roll. Man the rainbow roll was awesome!  And then the meat came...wow! The concept it there is a grill bowl in the middle of the table and you cook the meat yourself. Each of the meats were seasoned great and I had a blast cooking it myself. My favorite was the steak. Super good. With just two of us we had too much food. Ended up cooking the rest and boxing it to take home. 

Now about the Groupon..our bill came up to $45 and we tried to use our $25 Groupon but we didn't read the find print. It was for $25 of sushi, not BBQ. The one rainbow roll wasn't enough. Most times I would be upset but I didn't care, I enjoyed the food so much I'll gladly come back and order a few more rolls next time!  I actually can't wait till we come back. 

Also we had very good service, everyone was really nice. They stay open to 2am, I don't know what time they stop food service at but we were there till almost 11pm on a Friday night. Great place for late night food especially for the west side! I'll come here over a late night chain restaurant anytime!"}
{"text":"So taking a ride on the wild side of Asian cuisine found me visiting Ohya... yes I know very hard to pronounce because on one hand u feel like the Kool-Aid man saying 'Oh Yeah!\" ... and on the other hand like saying 'Oh ya!' With an Asian accent .. which can offend ... moving on ... so they have a great menu selection ... most Korean spots in the area hit u with the same basic items like bulgogi and the start having a Chinese food menu ... but this place stays true and true .. they had multiple items to choose from and some that are hard to find here in phoenix ... like one of my  favorites spicy rice cakes... and they did make me want to shoot out an 'oh yeah!'... very good ,.. they also have all u can eat bbq on certain days which is something u never find in Korean cuisine ... they have an awesome meat selection using fine cuts ...and u love how u can either grill the meat urself or have them grill it for u ... try the pork belly or Kalbi ... and ask for lettuce wraps and lots of toppings ... u can build ur own little wrap and add all kinds of toppings and then stuff it in ur mouth ... just like they do in the kdramas ...I also love the atmosphere ... one location has a huge cherry blossom right in the middle of the store with twinkle lights ... it was beautiful ..wish I was on a date nice ... price is why I didn't rate all five .... very high I must say ... but In the end .... well worth an 'Ohhhhhhh Yeahhhhhh!'"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place. He finally found an Awesome Korean restaurant and for me Awesome sushi! I had the tootsie roll and Vegas roll on happy hour (Sunday is all day happy hour) and my husband had galbi dolsat bibimbap and tuna nigiri. All Amazing!!!
Kelly took care of us, between her and the food- it was a Wonderful experience. We will return!"}
{"text":"Alright, so I'm OK with this place. 
The lady was nice...kind of.
We had a young baby and she wanted to seat us in the middle of the room... not a good idea.
1 person running around + Sleeping infant seat on a chair. I see bad things happening. She wasn't thrilled when I wanted to sit at booth. 
She allowed it though. 
They were out of the Yakisoba I originally ordered. No problem, we moved on from that. I ended up ordering a dish that usually comes with meat..which apparently could be made with out but switching meat for tofu was a no go. I don't really get it since tofu is much cheaper but I guess not adding tofu and just using veggies that would have originally came is even cheaper...but still... 
The noodles veggie mix ended up pretty bland, but luckily my stir fry came with a bunch of cold stuff I could add to my hot meal. The lotus root was a new try and tasty. I added that, seaweed and bean sprouts to my noodles and bland veggies. 
Fiance liked it, but I don't think this will be on our favorites lists since the vegetarian options are few and far between and substitutions seems to be an issue as well as seating. It was a neat experiment. They are very decently priced and I agree with other reviewers that the furniture is lovely..just not a great place to be a vegetarian"}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner and was pleased with the quality of the food. Service was good however only one waitress working the night I was there so she was very busy. I was not in a rush so I did not think the service was slow however if you needed to get in and out you may have thought it was slow. Good happy hour with a lot to choose from on the menu."}
{"text":"I am a return customer. I've visited with Korean friends over the last 3 years and must admit the food was not as good as good as previous years. I agree, I think the expansion has cost them some clientele."}
{"text":"Yummy. Very authentic! It reminded me of when I lived in Korea!"}
{"text":"The service at this place is unpredictable as each visit provides different experience which I think depends on the quality of the water/waitress assigned to your table and how busy the restaurant is at the time of your visit.  I have had really good attentive services throughout the meal, and other times, had no service at all (in the end, I could've walked out unpaid and no one will ever notice).  The food is good, their sashimi salad is decent, the Korean BBQ is tasty with the accessories that come with the order."}
{"text":"I love this place. Love. I love cooking at the table (if raw meat skeeves you out, the kitchen will cook it for you), with a giant platter of raw meat. Even if the pork belly is actually shade too fatty, and the chicken a wee bit gristly the marinated beef and pork ribs more than make up for any deficiencies. The banchan are on point, from pickled bean sprouts to marinated chunks of potato to deliciously garlicy kimchi. The sesame oil with pepper is a condiment that can pretty much up the game of any meal, but here works best sprinkled on the white rice served with the barbecue right before you top the rice with the meat. 

If, as I was on my most recent visit, you crave a little more starch, the bibimbap served in a hot stone bowl is the ticket. The trick is not stirring the toppings into the bottom of the bowl too vigorously. Instead, let that bottom layer continue to cook against the bowl while you eat from the top, and you will be rewarded at the end with a deliciously crunchy rice crust that's better than any dessert. Oh, and there's soju, sake, and beer on offer. 

I could eat at this place multiple nights in a row and not get bored. Word to the wise, you will leave smelling like bbq."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Food is good. Service is a little slow but it is ok! Great KBBQ in Glendale if you need a fix."}
{"text":"Love this place. We've dined in several times for lunch/dinner and have also ordered takeout many, many times. Great selection of hot dishes (our go to is always the daeji bulgogi) appetizers and a wide variety of sushi offerings. Our faves include the sonoran roll, mango pop and the gangster. They have a decent sake (hot and cold) and beer selection. They also have happy hour specials that run all day during the week.

If you dine in during lunch, take advantage of their amazing lunch specials. Two people can easily share a combo (choice of meat with sides and a 6 piece roll) and walk away happy. Also, the majority of tables have a grill in the center so you have the option of grilling your own meat if you'd like. Always fun for a date night or with a group of friends! They have a full bar (about 10 stools) and a sushi bar (both with televisions) and can accommodate large parties. Staff has always been friendly and helpful in explaining the menu (much of which is in korean).

Best thing about this place is they are open late. Real late. 1 am M-Th 2am Fri and Sat and 11 pm on Sunday. Need a late night fix? This is the spot. And again, get the daeji bulgogi. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love George the sushi chef. .tonight was not the waitress night....we brought friends with us that had never been and we were treated very inappropriate by the the waitress sue tonight. ..watch your bill with sue...."}
{"text":"Drive down here hoping for some actual KBBQ .  I thought the prices were over priced, but the lunch special prices were reasonable . Miso soup was cold and tasted so bland. It was like sipping on water w/tofu inside. They seemed to be short staffed. So unless I actually lived in the area I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Honestly what I love about this place is the name. LOL I cant stop saying it. LOL
The sushi rolls are HUGE. There are alot of menu items that I have no idea what they are and no pictures so I didnt bother trying anything new"}
{"text":"Slow service. There were only two servers/hostesses/busters for the whole dining room. Jade was sweet but there we've been here for over an hour an still don't have our check. 
Miso soup was light on the tofu. 
The avocado roll was flavorful and delicate. 
Ohya I Forgot and the Rainbow roll were great. I might order out, but the wait wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I asked if the restaurant is owned by the same owner as the CJB Korean BBQ place and the owner has not changed, but  the place looks like they are still under construction.  They still have their old sign up and so I was a little bit confused walking it thinking I had to choose a restaurant.  Inside it looks a lot better and bigger.  The tables are equipped with the round grills you use to cook your own meat if you choose.  

I had the current special that was only $14.95 and you get to pick your choice of a meat entree and either 2 traditional sushi rolls or 1 of the specialty rolls.  I picked the Kalbi and the Dynamite roll.  I also ordered the assorted soft tofu soup that had crab (imitation), clams, squid, and beef.  The Kalbi (beef short ribs) was pretty good.  When I tried the Dynamite roll, it was excellent.  It really tops any other place.  I also think the soft tofu soup is okay.  Their food is okay and I was delightfully surprised because I had tried the CJB Korean BBQ place a few times and it was the worst out of all the restaurants.  I highly recommend everyone to try this place out.

They have two rooms for private karaoke.  One larger room that fits about 15 people and the other one that fits about 10.  The waitress said that the smaller room was $30 for 2 hours.  After that it is $10 per hour.  The large room is $50 for 2 hours.  You have to order food and they charge a 18% gratuity.  They have Korean, Japanese, and English songs.  The selection is limited, but not bad.  

I am updating my review from a 5 to a 4. I love to have my birthday parties here and rent the karaoke private rooms, but the services and food is just okay. It's still a place I like to go to, but I prefer to get my Korean food at Paradise Hawaiian BBQ because it tastes better."}
{"text":"Upon walking into this restaurant, I noticed that the decor is cool. I was also seated right away (also winter break helped because nobody was at ASU West) with pretty much no delay from the waitress...almost like she was stalking me. XP

Now for the food. I ordered the L3 Lunch Special: A Bento tray with white rice, Korean sides, spring roll (or gyoza), miso soup and the meat that you chose. It was good.

As for the service, it was not that great. Firstly, the waitress never asked me if I would like gyoza or a spring roll. Secondly, she never gave me my miso soup. Other than that, service was not that bad. I do, however, understand that she was the only waitress working today. But still, she should have asked. 

Overall, the food was really delicious, and would have been better if I got the choice between gyoza and spring rolls and my damn miso soup. Whatever, it's okay. I hope it never happens again because the food quality outweighed the lacking service."}
{"text":"It used to be a great place for a nice meal, but recently in the past year, the standard start to go down hill. Some of the great Korean dishes like Soon Tofu Soup, Jjam Bong (spicy seafood noodles), bulgogi, side dishes, etc has become tasteless. The noodles in the soup dishes are mushy, and inconsistent thickness. Different thickness of noodles in one soup dish feel like leftover. It's a big disappointment. Will not go back there anymore."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get sushi. They have some of the best sushi I've ever had. I love the sauces they have with the sushi. They make a perfect match.   Beautiful the display on the plates. Great place for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Alrighty. Came back and tried this place again with a few friends that have never had KBBQ. I was excited to show them a good place. Well, this placed failed.

We decided on trying their KBBQ this time. I ordered the LA Galbi. And my friends ordered the bulgolgi. The LA Galbi had definitely been sitting for a while, it was no longer red, it was grey, and 70% fat and not marbled or of the quality in the picture on the menu. Kinda disappointing. Especially when it was 20.95.

We were starving so we pushed through. 

Their banchan, is...laughable. We spent over 40 on two small plates of not great quality meat, and we were given 6 small dishes of banchan. One of them being macaroni salad. My gma would laugh at this place. What type of KBBQ place serves macaroni salad? 

2 types of kimchi. Spicy seasoned bean sprouts. Regular bean sprouts. Potatoes and the very misplaced macaroni salad. Such variety, right?

At the end of our meal we discovered a very red hair on the new grill our waitress gave us. It ended up being woven into a piece of the bulgolgi. Gross. Before you ask, I have brown hair. My female friend had coal black hair. And the guys had next to no hair. 

No point in telling them about it because we had eaten the majority of the meat, so the damage was done. You know?

Go somewhere else for sushi and KBBQ. This is a place for first timers that havent experienced good KBBQ. 

Their ramen is good as well as the stone pot dishes."}
{"text":"My first trip to Ohya was my first visit to a Korean barbeque at all. Being a bit timid about unknown dishes, I opted for the bulgogi- MY GOD, it changed my life. I couldn't even describe the flavors in my mouth... slightly sweet, savory, faintly bbq, juicy, and oniony. That's not a word, but I digress. I raved endlessly about the bulgogi to my date, and even entertained the thought of returning the following day to order bulgogi to-go. I didn't, but vowed to be back within a week to stuff my face yet again.
On my next visit with my girlfriend, we opted to try the spicy bulgogi... and damn it if they didn't serve me an even better dish! I like spice, like, a lot. The same sweet bbq flavor but with a little scorch.
Today, the boyfriend and I both had the day off work, so of course I wheedled him into taking me for sushi in the afternoon. The place was nearly empty, except for a couple dudes grilling it up at their table and another solo dude. Anyway, Ohya has happy hour roll prices ALL DAY EVERY DAY and daily beer specials. Everything is super affordable, and the dark wood interior and low lighting really transports me.... to a place I've never been, but I trust this is what a hip joint somewhere in Korea would feel like. Did I mention they have two private karaoke rooms? Don't get me started on my love for karaoke.
I got sidetracked, and didn't even talk up the sushi. The Crunchy Cali Roll was cool and refreshing, and the Shrimp Tempura Roll had a great crunch and fresh flavor. I, however, fell in love with the Crispy Tuna Roll. It's basically a Cali Roll tempura'd topped with spicy tuna, a spicy aioli, and I think Sriracha. 
Suffice it to say, I'm in love with Ohya!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever trying Korean food. I ordered the yellowtail tuna jaw meat. It was very juicy and had a great flavor.  I also ordered S1 on the menu. I can't remember what it was called. That's how bad it tasted to me. Very little meat. The table I was seated at was sticking to my skin, even after the waitress cleaned it for me. The table also had a man's genitals scratched into the table. I was surprised that they would allow the table to be used. How hard is it to sand the table down and resurface? The waitress was a little slow. Overall experience wasn't what I was hoping, being my first time trying Korean BBQ. Probably my last."}
{"text":"Their Korean food is delicious, although I find their Korean BBQ to be lacking. They also have cheap alcohol and fair enough sushi, although I wouldn't go there specifically for the sushi. The service is hit or miss, depending on the time of day. It seems that the turn over rate is high since I've been there at least 8 - 10 times and haven't seen the same wait staff twice. 

They also play KPop and have private Karaoke rooms that you can rent. 

Overall, this is my go to place for Korean food."}
{"text":"This is easily some of the worst service I've received. Anywhere. Ever. I didn't even come here to eat, I just came for a little get-together that involved a group of 15-20 people, a karaoke room, and lots of sake bombs. 

Okay, maybe just A sake bomb. Mostly because it took forever to talk to anyone! There is a bar area that's separate from restaurant seating, but even though there was certainly the demand for a bartender, there was no one designated to take care of a counter with tons of traffic. In between serving tables, someone would come by really fast and take an order. It took nearly 40 minutes and several attempts to get someone's attention to be served. 

If I weren't there with really cool people, I would just rage quit, leave, and never come to this establishment again. 

After my order was placed, they fumbled around catering to the karaoke rooms, which understandably had priority, even at my expense. They ran out of the beer they'd normally use. They ran out of glasses and had to wash more. These poor young women were really busting their butts, and they were really nice. I don't blame them, they definitely needed one more person, and management that knows how to direct what were obviously some first-timers to the restaurant/bar industry. 

My sake bomb was great considering it was only $5. It was huge! Came with a 20 oz. bottle. The karaoke room was fun. I've never been to one before, but if they're all like that...flashing lights, no noise pollution, and ample seating...then I've gotta check out some more. 

What's also cool is that they serve food really late. Like, you can order til like 1:30, which seems unheard of for an authentic Korean establishment. 

It seems like there are definitely some growing pains here. People definitely love this place, but staff have WAY too much trouble keeping up. Virtually all the credit for enjoying my time here can be attributed to my pals. I will be back some time in a smaller group, but I'll wait a little while for them to figure out what they're doing."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service sucked. I had the sushi, ordered the rainbow roll , philly roll and the crunchy roll. The freshness of the fish was pretty good, as well how they made it. Crunchy roll was just ok nothing to brag about but edible.  My wife ordered the pork belly as well. It was good but not what we expected, not marinated. Althought it was still pretty good. We will go back I am sure. They need a hostess to help manage the servers and everything else.  No designated service area, they were all scattered. From not getting helped to having all 5 of them in like 2 mins.  Sushi took me 35 mins to get. Cancelled my last roll because it took too long."}
{"text":"I came here for my brother's b-day and didn't have a pleasant experience today. This restaurants been open for a while now and the service is always so sloooooooow. I've been here quite often, even before they expanded the restaurant. But eh..

Today we ordered galbi and tofu soup combo, jajangmyun (black bean paste noodles), pajeole (marinated salad) and nyangmyun with galbi combo. They brought out the galbi first and each one had about five pieces of meat on the plate. The galbi was yummy as usual and then my mom's nyangmyun came out. My mom ordered the spicy one and when I tried it it was so watered down so we had to ask for more spicy sauce. My brother then got his jajangmyun and that was just okay. When I got my soft tofu soup, I took a sip out of it and asked the waitress if she can take it back and add more sauce because it was so watered down and had no flavor. 

The waitress wasn't korean so I believe when she was talking to the cook, which is the owner of the restaurant. There was a language barrier and so the owner came out and looked all pissed off and asked what was wrong with it. My mom told her nicely that it needed more sauce and what not. Before my mom could finish what she was saying, the lady just walked off. We finally got our japeole and it was way too salty and was just drenched in the sauce. Finally the soft tofu soup came out and it tasted way better and I was able to eat it. 

The lady came back out later and asked us how it tasted and we thanked her for fixing it. That put a smile on her face. Overall, I'm not really pleased with the food this time. I've never had anything bad to say about it before but today it was just, let me put it in a nice way..... Very bland.. But before we left the owner packed up some kimchi for us to take home. That was very nice of her."}
{"text":"I think it is a great neighborhood restaurant. I am not particularly knowledgeable on Korean food, but my husband and I like this place a lot!"}
{"text":"We didn't come here with the intention of grabbing dinner. My group of friends wanted to go karaoke tonight. We simply called ahead and made a reservation for a group of 8. All of us fitted perfectly into the small karaoke room. It was $30 for the first hour, and $10 for every subsequent hour. We must have been terrible at singing since we consistently received a score of zero after every song. Apparently, the scoring system in the small room was broken, but the big room's scoring system was still intact. Darn, the big room was already reserved. At least we have the reassurance that we weren't that bad at singing. 

The room has two microphones and a big book of songs. The majority of the songs are in Korean. Fortunately, they have a fair amount of American songs. We stuck to the pop section - our favorite. It was a fun time singing/eating. The food was mediocre, but served its purpose for hungry singers. I\"ll definitely return to do group karaoke here."}
{"text":"I come to Phoenix a couple of times a year and made it a point to drive all the way up to Glendale to eat at CJB. I was a huge fan of the food and I really did love the huge wooden tables they used to have. I am grateful the place didn't totally disappear, but I did prefer the old restaurant to this new one. Thankfully, the quality of the food doesn't seem to have been affected.

The new location has much smaller tables which makes grilling harder. Also, the grill isn't gas anymore, it seems to be infrared or something that takes a long time to heat up.

My favorite dish on the menu is the melt-in-your mouth beef brisket. Paper thin slices of this meat are served partially frozen for you to grill table top. Be sure to grill this right away because when it thaws, it is hard to unroll to grill flat. We also had pork bellies, kal bi, and chicken. The chicken was the surprise of the night! It was so flavorful, I will have to order that again next time I come. We also had a combination soon tofu soup to share. This was really flavorful and I recommend it along with all of the food mentioned above."}
{"text":"Let me just start with an apology because I'll probably offend someone I know with this review because the Phoenix Asian community is so small. 

Don't get me wrong.  There are some great things here. One being the fUrNiTUre!!  I LOVE the wooden furniture here. I'm not just talking about normal wood furniture here, I'm talking about huge single pieces of wooden slabs being used as bench seats and seat backs. This furniture is wicked. 

The service is good too. The waitress spoke fluent Korean and English and knew what my friend Justin wanted when he ordered in Korean.  We had a few dishes. One of which was kimchi tofu soup. It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.  My friend Justin (remember, he's Korean) actually blurted out, this was the worst Kimchi Tofu soup he has ever had. We also had some spicy pork which was marinated not in the traditional spicy PASTE that is normally used but in a chopped up dry spicy chili that covered the meat like it was glitter. The spicy pork dish was supposed to have some sauce and the meat was supposed to be nice and juicy. Nope!  The dish was dry and served on a hot plate on a bed of chopped onions.  Add soju and a hot fish plate with some diet cokes and you suddenly have a bill approaching $50. 

As the Germans would say...  \"Nicht so gut!!\"

So in the end, the meal was summed up by my friend declaring the meal being the worst Korean meal he's ever had."}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant and no one was there to greet us. It took a few minutes for them to realize we were waiting. 
The manager came and brought us two waters and asked \"anything else\" and I said \"oh my friend needs a water\"(she was in the bathroom) and the manager rudely said \"oh I know and walked away\" 

We got the waters with no straws and have yet to see the manager/ waitress come back to ask if we are ready to order or have any questions. 

We finally got a nice young woman who came back to get our order and asked if we had any questions about the menu. 
We ordered Kalbi combo and we cooked it ourselves. The meat was sweet but good. We each got our own cup of white rice and it came with 6 side dishes. 

Overall after we got the new waitress and not the manager we ended having a decent experience. 
I just wish we had more Korean bbq options in Arizona besides a couple we have."}
{"text":"I usually have no problem with this place because it's not a place to expect the highest quality Korean food from....but 

My friend was craving Korean last night so we decided to order take out. After driving 30min to and from oh ya, we come home to find an order of bibinbap with NO RICE or sauces and a soup order without rice either. The banchan was bland and possibly over-refrigerated. Decided not to call in because it wasn't worth driving another 30 minutes for. Hope their service kicks it up a notch."}
{"text":"This is an AMAZING place!!  We go all the time for Korean BBQ.  Staff is wonderful, food is delicious, service is great. Two thumbs up!! :)"}
{"text":"This review may be more for the Asian community then others  just FYI...   Atmosphere is fun.   My best friend and I always come here on a Saturday night after she gets off work @ 2100 since this place is open while serving food until 0200.  They have 2 karaoke rooms one small another large.   Its a fun place to hang out and chill.   Food...   Well its a bit on the lower then average.   Im not sure how you can mess up duk-guk (rice cake soup)  but they cant seem to cook soup.   Even the edamame was inedible.   Food is also very expensive for lacking so much flavor.  Its like someone off the street trying to make Korean food.   The quality in taste is not their.   Service is descent.   Although they have 17-19 year olds that dont know the menu very well and have to constantly ask the owner or manager what we are ordering.   We've been going their for about 2 months now and they still dont know whats on the menu... O.o   Just a little suggestion...  Take the menu home and study it..."}
{"text":"I may not live in SoCal where the big KTown scene exists, but I am familiarized with the KTown in Santa Clara- so not to toot my own horn, but I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on Korean food, ne?

With a hankering for Korean food and all it's spicy, sweet, and savory goodness I came here to OHYA. To be honest, after dining here it wasn't so much of an OH YA! for me more like OH, OH ... that's it?

Ordered the Dolsot Bulgogi Bibimbap and the Seafood Soft Tofu Soup. The Bibimbap was alright, props to the clay bowl and sauce being pretty decent. Good amount of veggies, but meat seemed a bit lackluster. You can bet I doused my bowl in the Gochujang sauce. The Tofu Soup was just okay, lacking in seafood, they put imitation crab meat sticks in it which is a big no-no for me. You either put mussels, clams, shrimp in it not imitation seafood.

You get a discount for checking in, so be sure to tell your server prior to your bill coming out. The service was good, being that there were only 3 other tables occupied in the huge place with 3 other servers, but only one was serving/helping out. It was interesting. Our waitress was good though, as she kept checking up on us and such."}
{"text":"Much of what I stated in my first review is still true.  I do enjoy the food here at OHYA.  The karaoke rooms are fun and affordable, too.

This update follows some sorely understated service in our most recent visit here.  We attended a friend's graduation festivities in the large karaoke room.  We all ordered sushi and various dishes.  It was somewhere between 50-60 minutes from the time that we placed the order for sushi that it actually arrived.  The entrees arrived earlier, maybe 30-40 minutes after ordering.  It was a very slow process, which was frustrating.

Beyond this, the wait staff would step into the room, which was loud with karaoke music, and state the name of the sushi roll or dish.  We were seated on the far end of the room.  We'd ask \"What?\" when we couldn't understand what had been said and, in most instances, they'd not notice our waves until someone in our party pointed us out.  In one instance they just set a sushi roll down and no one knew what it was, not even the folks sitting next to the door.  Our water was also never refilled -- fortunately there were extra water cups on our table.

To exacerbate our existing frustration, we asked for our check around 7:55 PM.  Around 8:20 PM we still had no sign of a check, and no staff had returned to our room in that almost half hour window.  We ended up having to hunt down our server to pay, as did another couple in our party.  We had planned to stay about 1.5 hours.  We ended up being there closer to 2.25 hours, with a large chunk of that being time spent waiting for service.  This was a Tuesday night.  There were several full tables, but by no means a full house.  If I give them the benefit of the doubt, it seems they may have been understaffed.  Still....not pleased, OHYA.  And I had loved you, so much."}
{"text":"My very first dip into KBBQ was with CGJ, and I hadn't been back in years since its rebrand to OHYA til a few weeks back.

I am a walking social disaster and double-booked dinner plans with two separate groups of friends last night with OHYA being the first of two venues. Afraid to cancel on either, I sucked it up and tried to go for a lighter meal here. Aiming for the lighter bite was futile as I ended up grabbing a Caterpillar Roll, multiple bites of my friend's galbi, and waaaay too much banchan. That damned daikon always reels me in. Inevitably, I ended my meal way too full and had to mentally rally for the next dinner, at Oregano's, on the other side of town immediately after. Also the scent of marinated meat really stuck to my clothes and probably made for a strange and stark contrast for everyone within a 5 foot radius at an Italian place.

Overall, I was pretty pleased with my recent experience here. I've maybe been spoiled over the last few years with some more solidly stellar Korean places (in Rochester, of all places), but that's not to take away from OHYA's quality. The marinated meat options were as solid as I remember them being from days of CGJ yore, and the addition of a sushi portion to the menu while not particularly inspired was chill. VERY interested in the karaoke since I was short on time and didn't get a chance to make the push for it. Will definitely be coming back in the next few months."}
{"text":"This little unique Korean restaurant was located across the Arizona State University West Campus. I found this place when i was in a hunt for lunch around the west valley. 

I have been a frequent diner there myself. They have a variety choice of item in the menu, the prices seems real reasonable and decent portion. As most korean restaurant these days, they also offer serveral item in their menu that is not common korean dishes such as katsu(deep fried pork or chicken). 

I'm not a korean food connoiser, however, everytime when i was there, you will surely see a few korean that eat there. So i assumed that's a good sign. I would definately say that it's a great place for small gathering, small family dinner or for those who never tried Korean food before this would be a great place.

By the way, if you don't find the restaurant name along the strip mall, it's because all you will see is a sign that says \" Korean BBQ\" flashing on the wall. 

One more thing, when i was enquiring a few Korean friends about the name of the restaurant, they told me it was \"Chuhgajib\" and i really thought that they said \"Cho-co-late-chip\" .. lol ok.. it's not funny .. but it's an internal joke..."}
{"text":"My friend took me to this Korean BBW a week ago on a Sunday. It is located in a strip mall across from ASU - West. Upon entering the first thing i noticed was the furniture made of trees. It's really different and fun!
I cannot remember what we ordered but first we were served 6 or so small white bowls with cold vegetables. I was not impressed, although the cold potatoes weren't vomitous.
Then came the sizzling strips of beef and THAT was delicious, some of the best tasting strips of beef I've ever devoured.

I would say if you like Korean food, you would enjoy this place. I am not a fan of Korean food but I would eat those strips of beef anyday."}
{"text":"This place is completely off my list.  The atmosphere is OK as it looks dim and not the best area to wait for a table when they should be on the look out of guests waiting to be serviced.  Even the hostess walks back into the kitchen when she CLEARLY sees there is a line waiting.

Anyway, the waitress sat us down at a table with grill and we ordered BBQ combo for 2 as it was little worth the money plus an appetizer.  You would think they bring out the appetizer first BEFORE the main entree.  Then, we started grilling and about 10 min later, the grill stopped working.  Hmm....guess they don't do enough maintenance on the grills all the time. They offer to move us to another table or fix the grill....why do you offer to fix the grill in middle of dinner?  The waitress took the food inside the kitchen and cook it but guess how long that took.....15 to 20 min! 

This was a very disappointing experience for Korean BBQ grill as I had only been living here for 6 months and this place is for sure going down the drain with the customer service they provided and the hostess not being there to greet customers as they walk in.

Sorry, OHYA you lost business and continue to go down no matter what."}
{"text":"Broken grill and poor service. 

We drove here all the way from central Phoenix belated on the Yelp reviews. 

When we got here, there were other patrons waiting in the TINY wait area by the front door and the hostess didn't show up for over 10 minutes, even though there were 4 groups of people by now. 

We order the BBQ combo for 2, and a quarter of the way into grilling, the grill breaks. They offer to move us to another table, or fix the one we have. 

Are they going to work in repairing it while we're sitting here? Are you kidding? We asked that they grill the food in the kitchen, since other people seem to be having grill issues as well. 

15 minutes later, and after asking the waitress what's going on, they FINALLY bring out the BBQ. 

it's chopped up meat that cooks in 2 minutes! 

This place is off my list. Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Ahh gaaaahh. Third time here. Two times more than I should have. Food is typically average. Only come because my parents are intrigued by their $8.50 lunch box... But this third time was just uuggghh. I try to be an understanding customer and not lash out at waitresses because usually if the food is crap, it's not their fault but I gave these two waitresses my first lashing because they let me sit there and boil for twenty minutes as I waited for them. 

The experience (setting: there were only 5 other occupied tables and no one came in after us):
1) it was15 minutes after we were seated before we got water. We had to ask for it. Our glasses were never refilled.. Esp since they didn't come by until I called for them.
2) there were 4 of us. we had to ask for another utensil setting since table only had 3. 
3) food took 10 minutes to partially come out. We had to ask for our miso soup since they forgot or didn't know our lunch came with it. Waitress told us that our two cali rolls would take a little bit. Those did not come out til 30 min later. 
4) food was beyond poor. My teriyaki salmon didn't have a teriyaki glaze. Seemed like it was just deep fried. Hard - overcooked. My dads teriyaki salmon was   still raw in the inside. My moms bulgogi was flavorless and cold and galbi was hard and not marinated. My bfs tofu soup (soondubu) tasted Ok but not traditional flavor or what I'm used to. Wasn't even red. Daeji bulgogi was Ok. Lastly, the Cali roll was ugh. The rice around the roll just didn't taste right. The insides were standard.

I asked if there was a new chef or something and she just responded, we are a bit unorganized today. My parents have been here more than me and said this time was the worst, too, and  we've never had the same waitress... Sooo.. Yeah.

Done with this place."}
{"text":"Ohno.  Used Groupon.   Came around 1:00pm on a Sunday.  Only 2 servers and no bussers.  Waited about 5 minutes to be seated.  Waited for 5 more minutes to give drink orders.  Waited for those too.  Ordered lots of food.  Sashimi A & Firecracker were only good items.  Other rolls were not fried enough.  Too much rice and not fresh avocado.  Tables were not cleaned at all during entire time there.  They left ALL the used tables to be cleaned until after their lunch rush.  Very, very unsightly and pretty gross. Kind and nice people but would not go back for anything except sashimi and Firecracker.  Sashimi was fresh and the firecracker had good and fresh jalapeño."}

Love it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. Ever! The place is modern, clean, and open. The waitresses are very friendly and knowledgeable about their menu and can make great recommendations if you ask them. Their sushi chef is ridiculously good. He can make anything you ask for in the spot, no problem. Their happy hour goes on all day, which is great. They have awesome deals on both sushi and drinks. Their Cherry Blossoms are delicious!! I've spent both my birthday and anniversary here because I love everything they make. I've NEVER had a bad experience here, and my hubby and I come by quite often. It's just great food, great people, and great times!! Friends have come to try it out after my raving and they are now regulars too. If you like great sushi and amazing Korean food, this is the place to be. Love Ohya!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Ohya Sushi, thanks to Groupon. We don't typically get around to this area often so I was stoked to come across this place. We arrived and were greeted and sat immediately. Our waitress, Seung-hu, was an absolute doll and was very on top of our order. The food was perfect and probably the best sushi we've had here in Phoenix. We said \"Mmm\" so much that our neighbors ordered what we got (volcano roll & Vegas roll). We have already discussed coming back and bringing friends to share the experience."}
{"text":"Had a great time, food was good & the service was friendly :)
We'll be back soon!"}

{"text":"My husband and I just happened to find this place on accident. I looked it up on Yelp and the reviews seemed fun and the food sounded well priced. We came in on a Tuesday because of the All-You-Can-Eat Sushi deal that have going on. One thing that didn't sit too well for me were the Rules to the All-You-Can-Eat deal: the whole party has to do the deal individually not just one person, you only get 90 minutes to start and finish the deal, any sushi left gets extra charged on your bill, no signature rolls, and you can only order 3 times. My husband wanted to order his own thing and I wanted to do the sushi deal but the waitress said he couldn't do...that so we both decided not to do the deal and just order sushi regularly. The drink deals they had were well priced - $2.50 for a pint of Blue Moon every Tuesday - and everyday a new drink is specially priced. So the two of us ordered 5 different sushi rolls and udon noodles. The presentation of the sushi was very pretty and looked professional. However, there were some problems I had with the sushi that I think were more opinion based on my side but I have been eating sushi for years and know the basics of what it should be/have/not have. For one, the rolls were either too big to eat in one bite and fell apart or fell apart just picking them up the first time. My husband's California rolls were so lightly rolled they fell into his soy sauce almost every time and splattered sauce everywhere. My Shrimp Tempura rolls were so big you couldn't eat it in one bite and that made me have to bite it in half and thus making the roll fall apart. There was wasabi in the Avocado roll which was a bit strange and in all the other rolls there was lettuce wrapped in. I have never had a basic sushi roll with lettuce rolled in it also - I personally was not a fan of it. The udon noodles were ok but nothing amazing. The noodles themselves were a bit hard and you only get one small shrimp tempura stick on the side. The best thing we ate here and we're really surprised about was the Miso soup. My husband and I lived in Korea for a while and the Miso soup there, which was awesome, tasted just like the one we had here. I will definitely be coming back for the Miso soup. The restaurant itself is very clean, entertaining, and seems very modern in that it caters to the younger 20s crowd and that's great - but in my personal opinion for the amount I spent in sushi there I wish the sushi was a little better."}
{"text":"Overall a big blech...  Is this is the best Korean food that Phoenix has to offer? No way.

I grew up in L.A. and spent my childhood going to Koreatown and know the real deal when I see it AND taste it. This ain't it folks. 

Went there with the family on a Groupon - Initial impressions were not so good. The place looked semi-clean, and a young Korean couple next to us seemed to be picking at their food rather than eating it. So I asked them what they ordered and \"was the food good?\" and they sort of both rolled their eyes without much enthusiasm and the gentleman shook his head firmly side to side while looking down... not such a good omen right?

Oh Boy.

We ordered the Bulgogi, the spicy pork and the ribeye steak. The meats were generally fatty and not thinly sliced - they also did not taste like they had been well marinated (the Bulgogi). 

The Ribeye was leathery tough and super fatty (even for Ribeye) - the meats overall needed a good trimming before being brought to the table. I've had better meat at Sizzler. 

The side dishes were also just so-so, very one dimensional as other reviewers have pointed out. Really disappointing as the sides can be one of the best experiences at a good Korean BBQ in L.A. or San Francisco. Not here though.

One concern was the \"tough as beef jerky\" Ribeye was served as whole steaks, and since there were no knives at the table for after the meat was cooked...we requested a serrated knife and fork. 

The waitress then suggested that \"why don't you just use that scissors\" as she pointed at the food scissors that she had previously used to cut some of the raw Bulgogi up before cooking. I responded by saying that \"that was used on raw meat - probably not a good idea,\" to which she giggled and smiled and went and brought something to cut up the jerky - er beef - with. 

Would we return here? Never. 

I will honestly be surprised if this place is open a year from now - Groupons won't be enough to save this place from mediocre food."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, BBQ was good, cheesecake was good, prices were very reasonable and the service was good. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We walked in and immediately it smelled like old fish.  The server was nice and provided good service. We ordered kimchi chigae and bilgogi bento box.  The veggie/apps that are a traditional Korean staple were fair except the green beans tasted like they had been prepared in a dirty old sock.  The chigae tasted like they added 20 tablespoons of salt!  The rice was overcooked.  My boyfriend and I could barely eat but I unfortunately ate more than he did.  We ate less than 1/4 of our meal as we both could not stomach another bite.   Our server brought back two 1's and the rest were $5's (hint hint??). Our bill was $18 and I think she was expecting at least a $5 tip.   We paid our bill and did not tip her $5.  30 minutes later I'm in the bathroom and was in the bathroom for the rest of the day as my body obviously didn't agree with the food.  We both agreed that we should've turned around as soon as we walked in.  Ugh!"}
{"text":"Ive been hearing a lot of hype about this place thru my friends so i deff wanted to come check it out. Came in one night with my best friend to catch up and grab some food/drinks. Got a martini. cant remember which but it was delicious! Ordered the kimchi Chigae, it was also yummy. Ordered the Ahi Tuna Poke dish.. Tuna poke is my favorite dish and usually when i order it at other sushi places its not that great for the price, so i was really impressed. Also got Korean bbq of course, the galbi and samgyupsal was SO good. the food was SO flavorful and delicious!! And our server SIMON was such a sweetheart! Ended up spending around $80 for two ppl or so and i was tempted to order more because I was still hungry but i held back. All in all my favorite Korean restaurant in Arizona! I plan on making many more visits.

Did not get to try the karaoke or the sushi but theres always next time!

My friend was disappointed they didn't have bean sprouts as a side dish but that's about it."}
{"text":"There is definitely a cluster of good Korean restaurants in metro PHX and they're on the West Side, people. 

Growing up and living in the Washington, DC area gave me ample choices for Korean restaurants and bars. If you ever find yourself in Annandale, Virginia, you'll be in the center of some of the best Korean food outside of Seoul. I've dined on Korean fare enough to know what's good and OHYA reminds me of those Korean barbecue spots from back east. You can fire up the tabletop grill and cook your food yourself or have the kitchen add fire to your beef, pork, seafood, chicken or pork belly. I singled out pork belly because you should definitely order some and you should cook it yourself so you can get it as crisp as you like. Or not crisp at all.

The side dishes that accompany a meal- AKA panchan/banchan are pretty good, although they are more on the sweet side and not as hot & spicy as the deep red color of the kimchi might convey. The cucumber kimchi is my favorite but I'll also ask for seconds of the sprouts dressed in sesame oil.

This is also a great spot for sushi and they have $5 Kirin sake bombers all day. 

I noticed two private karaoke rooms so if you feel like partying with a group of friends, here would be a good location to try your vocals out. The one Friday night I was here there were multiple karaoke parties going on and every once in a while when the door would open for a cocktail order to be delivered from the bar, the sound of a cat being strangled with a wire coat hanger over the beat of an 80's power ballad would emanate from within. 

Clientele was mixed and you won't feel like you're an outsider if you're not familiar with Korean food or customs. Wait staff will gladly answer questions and guide you along your way.

Korean cuisine is outasight and if you haven't tried some or you've been searching the valley for a spot to enjoy it, head over to OHYA."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The food ingredients doesn't seems to be consistent. Sometimes the meat is well marinated where it taste flavorful. Sometimes it taste like plain meat, no flavor at all. I remember ordering the vegetable pancakes. The first time, it came with a sweet sauce. The second time I ordered, it came with a very salty sauce. I asked the waiter if there was another sauce. She said no. That's the one usually comes with it. The second sauce was wayyyyy too salty, I couldn't even dip it. Which it was a very disappointment. I was excited for it and told my boyfriend how it was so good too. The service is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"The food here is great. But the service is worse. I've been here for 2 years but this my first time that I think I have to tell. I hate the attitude of the girl who has the blue or green hair kinda ombre black.. she looked at us like we're abnormal,  and when she brought the food to us, so rude.  I don't know why but it's unacceptable. I didn't mean to point. But I have to do that.  Sorry girl. You did a bad job. I don't know how you treat all of your customers. But for me.... bad to bad.  I will never come back again, if not, I won't let you to serve us. Thanks for being rude."}
{"text":"Korean food is incredibly flavorful.....and I can confidently say that Ohya's food is incredibly flavorful.

We have been coming here for quite a few years - and we just keep coming back for more. And we keep bringing friends here and one for one, they love it!

Kimchi is fresh & pungent & wonderful. BBQ is fabulous. We love the pork & the squid.

I grew up in LA so I know good Asian food & this is very good."}
{"text":"I come here all the time when drinking. Prices here are amazing for sake bombs. Food also is great too! Very cheap lunch specials. Service, not so great."}
{"text":"We went here for my friends birthday. We ordered the Korean bbq deal for 4 people and it was a lot of food!

The different sauces for the meat was delicious! The soju went well with the meal. 

The seafood tofu soup was so good! Extra spicy.

Can't go wrong with the food here. It is a bit far for us so we don't make it to this side of town much."}
{"text":"It's time to review the new facelift. 

Added a new sushi bar (all day Happy Hour prices on certain rolls)
Added two new private Karaoke rooms (a good selections of both English and K-Pop songs)  
Added new furniture and mixed of the old ones. I thought the traditional furniture made the restaurant feel more unique.
Added a teppan grill bar.     

Quality:  It's not the best fish quality you will get on the sashimi, however if you order the sushi rolls, they aren't too bad.  According to my friend that knows her sashimi, the Sushi roller didn't even know how to cut the fish.  That's pretty sad!  I guess you can fool the people that really doesn't know the difference between sashimi and sushi.  Banchan (small side dishes) wasn't fresh and ever shrink the portion size. I still like the Soondubu (Soft Tofu Stew) combos and Seolleongtang.  

Price:  Of course, when a restaurant expands consumer always end up paying for the overhead. The price did go up a bit. They do still have the their $4.99 lunch special.  Thumbs up for the Owner!  

Service:  One day is good and another time is horrible.  It really depends who you get. Very inconsistent!   

Hours:  Yay, finally another Korean place opening late on Friday and Saturday until 2AM. The best hangover stop!"}
{"text":"I'll pass. I have been here several times. The service is usually slow. but the sushi is good. Although, tonight I got two rolls and and App to go. I ordered plan chicken wings, and when I bit in, it was red! I called and they said they would replace it if I brought it back in. That ain't happening!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, restaurant was dirty can't imagine what the kitchen looks like. If they clean up their act I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered two rolls and both of them sounded delicious. When I received them from a delivery service I opened them up and realized I just paid 25 bucks for two sushi rolls... without sauce. I went back to double check the menu and both rolls came with fancy sounding sauces which didn't come. I don't know about you but plain sushi just doesn't do it for me. I was very disappointed that it was just.. forgotten."}
{"text":"This place was nice, it was not busy when I came in.. Customer service ehhhh. I felt so rush, she kept wanting us to order quickly.

First time that I went to a Korean restaurant they play Korean music.:)) 

My friend got the Jap che,
I loved my vegetarian Yakisoba :) its a must.  Its a dry noodle with great sauce and with vegetables. It tastes even better with kimchi :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a three star because I actually come here regularly cause a lot of my friends come here.. and it's also open late. That's a plus. 

I like OH YA because the interior reminds me of LA all you can eat Korean BBQ. This is the only place that has karaoke & a grill where you can self cook with your family and friends. I love the idea of it... but they need to hire servers that pay attention to their customers. Also they just always seemed under staffed.

I came in with my best friend and yes it was crowded on a Friday night. We waited 20 minutes to be seated and it took them 10-15 mins later to even take our order. We raised our hands multiple times so we can order but we were ignored. Our server finally got our orders down.. and she disappeared again. We are 15 mins in our meal and no one brought us water until we had to ask the hostess that our server forgot our water. Smh. 

We ordered the green onion salad which is delicious! Soon Soup which was a little bit bland.. We also ordered the combo Kalbi, chadol & bulgogi which was pretty good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for some good, tasty comfort food.  I love that they're open every day, and have very cheap lunch specials.

My favorite dishes are the daeji bulgogi and the seafood tofu soup.

I've tried other Korean bbq places and this is my favorite in town."}
{"text":"This location barely rates 2 stars overall I give it a solid Meh.  The Scottsdale location serves incredible food cooked by Korean chefs.  This place the food isn't nearly as good and the staff isn't Korean and doesn't know how to cook Korean food or even basic terms for Korean sides.  The fern in my hot stone bowl was improperly cooked making it bitter and bland, the bowl lukewarm and the food is well, to reiterate, meh. 

Go to the Scottsdale location if you want good authentic food.  This location is a pass and we tried it twice before we left a poor review.   First trip was a 2.25 star meh.  This time it's a 1.75 star meh."}
{"text":"I had just ate here today for the first time and it was delicious! I had several different types of sushi I had ordered and a alcoholic pineapple frozen drink. The one order of rolls I really enjoyed a lot were the spicy salmon rolls which were amazing! I will definitely return here to try something different but I was very satisfied with my first visit:)! Never had a empty glass and left with a full stomach!!"}
{"text":"Yes!!! Or should I say, Oh Ya!!! Sorry, I had to do it. But this place has what you want from a good Korean restaurant. 

Let's start with atmosphere, since in my book it is the least important aspect when I'm looking for good Korean food. Yet, Ohya really has a great look and vibe! I love the solid wood benches and tables, and the decor is tasteful and clean.

The service we experienced was superb. A couple servers attended to our needs, and did a great job at making us feel welcome. 

Now. The food. Can I just ask, \"Why does almost every Korean place in America put a FRIED egg on top of dolsat bibimbap?\" But have no fear: Ohya does it right and gives you a raw egg so it can bind with all those yummy veggies as it cooks in your bowl. Thank you, Ohya. I must say, the Galbi dolsat bibimbap was superb and I can't wait to have it again.

I also had some tuna sushi and my wife had a couple rolls. These too were all amazing. In fact, since we've been back in town it was the best sushi we've had! 

See you next time when I think I'll go for some (or a bunch of) bulgogi!"}
{"text":"This was my first vist here and to a Korean restaurant that lets you cook at your table.  Each place I have ever visited they cook it in their kitchen and serve it up.  This was a fun and unique expereince I am glad I shared with friends.   We did ordered some shumai, some goyoza and a combo meal with Galbi, bulgogi and daeji bulgugi .  It was served up with the typical banchan.  The combo worked well split between 3 hungry adults and a hungry 4 year old.  Add a large Korean beer to the mix and it was a lovely comforting meal.  

The banchan was fresh and plentiful and the meat was perfectly seasoned.  You better believe I will be back!"}
{"text":"not a perfect place to go, but I like what I order.
First things first... I always pronounce \"Chuhgajib\" wrong.

The way I pronounce it, it sounds like 'brothel house' in Korean, it's suppose to mean the wife-side parent's place I believe.  (Please let me know if I am wrong)

My girl is Korean and loves going to this place and I've grown to love it!

I personally love the stone bowl that the bi bim bap comes out in.  Keeps the food hot though if you don't mix it... the rice gets hard on the bottom.  It isn't obvious if you don't eat it often.

the other thing I usually get is the T12 (or whichever it is with the BBQ pork and choice of tofu soup).  I love the BBQ pork, it can't be found in many other Korean places and it's unlike anywhere else that has it... so warning to anyone else who has had it and change your expectations now!
The Tofu Soup I get is always the seafood and extra spicy, I like it that way... wouldn't recommend it to those who can't handle spice.

Unfortunately, the food is not cooked consistently... I can tell when the older lady cooks the food or someone else does.  She's clearly the better cook and I didn't give this place a 5 star because of the chance where I don't get her and the food is disappointing.

Last of all, the price is great, it's a well priced Korean place (especially lunch or happy hour) and my favorite Korean in the valley because I can afford to go back."}
{"text":"I like the food here, not complaining about that. but the prices are ridiculously high for what you get, their portions are pretty small while the prices are really high, if they fixed the prices, or gave more portions I would definitely rate this place 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"Slow service and not authentic Japanese sushi. It's Korean. ....also smelled weird by the bar. The sushi chef cooked some of the hot sushi in a microwave.... eww...still looking for good sushi in Arizona."}
{"text":"We ordered BBQ combo #7 which includes spicy pork, chicken, pork, beef, short rib, steak, pork belly, squid, and beef brisket. We also ordered some beers and two soups -- kim chi stew and bean curd soup

FOOD: 2/5
The meat was decent and plentiful for about 5 - 6 people. The meat quality was pretty good. What gives it 2 stars are the soups and beer. I have no idea who cooks it back there but it does not taste like what it is supposed to taste like.  This is not only the opinion of just myself but also the opinion of 3 other Koreans I was with. The kinchi stew was over powered with pepper flakes and hot pepper paste. The bean curd soup was missing something buy we couldn't figure it out. We did manage to scoop out a glob of bean curd paste that hadn't mixed in well with the soup. That may have been the mixing ingredient. 

The beer -- when you order a beer keep in mind that it is a large bottle not the usual 12 FL Oz bottles. One bottle is enough for two. 

SERVICE: 5/5
The service was pretty good. The lady was very attentive and made sure to stop by frequently to ensure we were taken care of  they were quick to replace all the side dishes and came by to explain the menu thoroughly till we were satisfied. 

COST: 4/5
The cost was decent but slightly on the pricey side especially given the quality of soup. 

DECOR/FACILITIES: 4/5
Very clean inside. The bathrooms are also clean. I did not like the electric grills but they do the job. Because it is electric grills, the pans take a little longer to heat up and is easily cooled when meat is placed on top. 

Overall, this restaurant doesn't really highlight itself as a GO-TO restaurant. I honestly wouldn't bring anyone new to korean bbq here as it doesn't really have anything special or unique about it. I'm reluctant to give it a 3 star. I would want to give 2.5 but 3 is what I will settle with as the meat was somewhat decent."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great food. Bar far my favorite Korean spot in town."}
{"text":"Awesome service, good food... Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, but their service is not great- especially with to go orders. We placed a to go order and were told they were not doing to go sushi orders right now. But they did not refund it and instead told us to call eat 24 to handle it. 

We also have issues with the time it takes to make the food. I love their sushi and food, I just wish they had better service."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at this restaurant and the food was outstanding. We were a threesome and each had a different entree everybody rated there dish as better than they have had at any other restaurant. The appetizer was a Korean seafood pancake and it was simply delicious. The assortment of other appetizers were great. The kimchi was great, the cucumbers had  a delightful sauce, the potato salad with Apples was an imaginative dish, and the Korean potato's were a hit with all.  My complete bill wit a generous tip and drinks was $95.00."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here at Ohya for this place is located very close to my school (ASU west). I came here on many occasions with friends and have introduced many people to this spot. I normally get okay service however my last visit was very unexpectedly inappropriate. My waiter found me on social media after my visit just to comment about his tip.

Let me start from the beginning, my friend brought me here on my birthday, a Saturday around 3pm. Before arrival we called and ordered a few sushi rolls ahead of time over the phone because we were in a hurry and they usually take a long time to make your rolls from my previous visits. Since the food was ready by the time we got there, we were in and out within 20 minutes. I wasn't sure if the waitress dining the table next to us was our waitress because no one checked up on us, but by the time we were done eating and ready for the bill our waiter finally came to refill our drinks. (it was surprisingly not busy there for a Saturday however, it was 3pm). My friend tipped according to how much service he gave which was 10% of the bill. 

The day after on a Sunday night, I received a comment on a photo I posted of their food on instagram a month ago (with the same rolls I ordered from my last visit). It was from the waiter making a comment about how low I tipped him. I was extremely shocked and have no idea how he found me. I thought it was inappropriate and uncomfortable for him to find me on social media and have to say something just because of a tip. Either way tipping is optional and I usually tip 20%, however my friend tipped according to how much service he gave us. I replied back to him asking what his name was and he deleted his comment. See the photos I posted of screen shots of the incident and his IG profile to avoid him if you visit. I now feel very uncomfortable returning to this restaurant over the situation that occurred and will not be bringing my friends here if this is the kind of service I get back.


EDIT: I reached out to the owner with the same story and after further investigation he let go of the waiter. You are now safe to come eat here without being stalked!"}
{"text":"Look no more, this is the best Korean food in Phoenix! Great $5 lunch specials with tons and tons of food. Everything is fresh and expectionally tastey! My husband is a big fan of Korean food, so we come here quite often. This place is always crowded...hmmm I wonder why? Probably because it is so darn good. If you have never tried Korean good, then you have to try this place. I highly recommend the beef bulgogi. Plus if you are a bubble tea fan, they have a buy one and get the other half off special. One last thing, if you come for lunch be prepared for a longer wait time since it gets pretty busy.
-M.P."}
{"text":"Overall all the meals I had here are good. Best seat in the place has to go to the back corner of the resteraunt with a circle grill though. Best thing to eat of course is korean bbq. I usually go with a group of 4 or more and we always order combo #3 with bulgogi. Super good. The meat sometimes seems frozen, especially the samgyupsal but overall it's tasty. I would recommend reserving that table first if you're coming in with a group just because the place has really small tables that wouldn't fit all of your food on it. But overall my experience has been great."}
{"text":"Was in the area for a grad school interview and the BF was craving some red meat. Came here based on yelp reviews, left pretty full, content about the food. 

Service was friendly enough, but we had some trouble communicating what we wanted. We settled on the kalbi, bulgogi and the ribeye? steak meats, with an order of the tofu soup. Everything was a-okay but I think the only thing that stood out was the ribeye. Normally we like to cook the meat ourselves but since we didnt want to stink on our plane ride back to cali, we decided to let them do it for us. Side dishes were standard with the different pickled veggies, kimchi, potato salad, etc. Waiters were pretty prompt in bringing out replacement side dishes for us.   

Since we don't know the area very well, the stars are good service, being open at odd hours (I think we got there at 4pm?) clean restaurant, decent food. -2 stars for small portions and no real wow factor."}
{"text":"Without attempting to unfairly compare this place to \"LA-Style\" places, it just fell flat in my opinion and was overpriced (my opinion again). Though the meat is fresh, the electric grilles for the cook yourself aspect just don't compare to regular grilles and you don't get the full selection you would normally see in a traditional Korean BBQ (though they do have many types of food).

Hot sauce/sriracha is an option rather than on the table and on a busy night that took a while to get. There are also no steamed egg soups here or rice paper (I believe that's what they're called). The customer service nonetheless was great, multiple waiters would check on us and maybe just once I had to \"call for attention\". I will perhaps change my review when I eat there on one of the all-you-can-eat nights, but I'd still give 4-4.5 stars at best. It would be great if the all-you-can-eat nights were more than twice per month. As of now though, they're the best around so far in Phoenix (that I've tried)."}
{"text":"This restaraunt is located in the best place possible however.. The food is mediocre at best. Because of the low price for lunch special we as consumer has to make big sacrifices such as eating shit. That alone is already a big enough detractor to turn customers away but they top it off with turtle speed customer service. This is unfortunate."}
{"text":"Not too many Korean BBQ places around, so this place is a treat that actually has really good food.  Across the street from ASU West, this place caters to a younger crowd, but good for anyone of any age. I haven't had Korean food since I was in Korea back in 1993, and this was better than I remember, which is to say REALLY good. We had the bulgogi, which is thinly sliced steak, and it comes with veggies, and rice.  The veggies include Korean pickles, potatoes, onions, and kimchi.  We also had yaki mandu, which is a Korean egg roll.  The service was prompt and couldn't be more friendly.  Very nice people, and the place is clean, too.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I know someone who went here with an actual Korean man and he said it was authentic.  That's good enough for me!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to this place for awhile and finally came here on my birthday with my brother and his gf and the food was great! also our server Sammi was very nice and helpful.we ordered the firecracker(a definite must try) the vegas roll,the golden alaska roll,and the philly roll and they all were all delicious..i also got a free birthday dessert of vanilla and mango mochi(yum bonus!) i will definetely be back here soon."}
{"text":"Where's the beef??? 

Holy cow!!!  They have got to the stingiest people ever.  Check out my photo of the Kalbi entree.  I kid you not.  I've eaten here numerous times but my last visit will have to be my final visit.  Did they change ownership?  I had my usual Seafood Tofu soup and Kalbi combo.  The kalbi portion has got to be the smallest beef entree I've ever gotten anywhere.  I felt like I got robbed eating here.  Definitely didn't get what I paid for.  Never again!!  

Also, the Kalbi wasn't marinated very well, it just wasn't very tasty.  All the side dishes were of the poorest quality.  Kim chi wasn't good.  This restaurant has dropped down to one of the worse Korean restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"This place was decent. This place offers sushi and Korean style food and I wanted to try the Korean. It's right down the road for me. My go to Korean is Cafe Ga Hyang, and I wanted to try something closer. Also my coworkers talk about this place having amazing Korean food.The staff was friendly or at least my server was. The others seemed to be involved with the baseball game that was going on. For starter I had Duk Boki, which was disappointing cause the sauce tasted like something I can make at home with the packet you can buy at a Asian market. I also ordered the three oysters special. I asked where the oysters were from no one seemed to know. I still ordered them cause I was enthusiastic about this new place down the road from me. When I ate my first oyster, it wasn't properly cleaned and I swallowed some of the shell. So my next two oysters I cleaned them with my drinking water. They weren't bad. I was bummed cause I washed off all the sauce that came on top of the oysters but I couldn't risk swallowing more shell. My dinner was a Korean hot soup with intestines and tofu. That was decent and had good flavor, which saved this review. I'm hesitant about going back to try something else. For now I will drive a little further for much better food and experience when I am craving Korean."}
{"text":"This place has definetly expanded since last time I was here. They have new BBQs at the tables and the service was good and the food good as well. I had the terryaki salmon which came on on cast iron skillet like fajitas come on. Food so HOT I droped a small piece of onion on my arm and it burnt and left a mark. Im not complaining becuase I like my food hot and this place delivers. Could have used a little more rice but had I asked Im sure they would have brought some more. Will def come back again."}
{"text":"Ha. My dyslexia strikes again.  The delicious beer was OB, not BO...  Thanks to Joel L. For the heads up!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice. Only a girl serve the table. If there are too many people,you have to wait for a long time. 
 We ordered the tofu soup. That was great. Others, just that taste. Not good not bad."}
{"text":"Cost: I feel like it was expensive for Korean BBQ with not a lot of meat. 

Service: service was good. Had a nice waiter. 

Food: The food was average. Tasted a lot of vinegar on the spicy bulgogi. One of my friend said it tasted bitter. 

My experience: My first time here. Decided to try out this place with a few friends. We decided to order the big $80 Korean BBQ variety of meat. I think it was combo 7. It says it serves \"5+\" (5 or more ppl) there was 7 of us. When the plate came, it wasn't much meat. To be honest, the serving would of only probably be enough for 3 people to be full. I felt that it was over priced n there wasn't enough food. So we knew that it wasn't gonna fill us all up, my other friends ordered more things such as a sushi roll n two kids teriyaki rice bowls. In addition to that, we had to order another plate of meat too. Our bill ended up to be $151. I should of taken a picture of the plate. It would of been a lot cheaper if I just ordered regular food off the menu or may be even cheaper if I ordered individual plates of meats."}
{"text":"This restaurant continues to be my go to spot for Korean BBQ since my review a couple of years ago. Every time we go, the restaurant is steadily full with a wide variety of patrons. 

You can choose to cook at the table or have them cook for you. Usually we opt to cook at the table but a few nights ago, we decided to have them cook it for us. Same price. Usually, we opt for the $30 combo that has the daegi bulgogi, dalk gui, and the Kalbi. If I said it right, it is the spicy pork, chicken, and short ribs. That is more than plenty for the 3 of us...leftovers are the best! This last time, we each ordered a spicy pork plate at $13 each (my favorite and I don't really eat spicy food). I felt like we looked like gluttons when the food came out. Very good portions. 

I also love the panckak (sp?) they bring out with various items to enjoy with your meal. My 5 year old demolished the white radishes and I had to fight her over the bean sprouts. So good. As always the service is friendly and attentive. I have been to other Korean BBQs where if you aren't in the same culture, you aren't treated the same. Not so with CGJ. I always enjoy my meal here. Inexpensive and delicious food."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident, as we can never remember where the \"other\" Korean BBQ is.  We don't need to remember anymore, as this is now the go-to place.  The service was excellent, the food was authentic and abundant, the price was good, there wasn't anything even remotely substandard about the place.  
We didn't have a waitress...we had four.  They were smart, friendly, accomodating, and fast.  They have about 100 different pieces of sushi on the menu, but I was after Kimbap, like I used to get from the truck in Korea.  Not on the menu, but they made a couple anyway.  They carry Cass beer, the only Korean beer that travels well.  1 liter bottles of it.  As a lover of the spiced vegetable side dishes, I was thrilled to find the girls would bring new treats out as fast as we could eat them.  No extra charge, no sour faces, like at the \"other\" BBQ.  The girls brought out so much meat, we couldn't eat it all.  But they happily cooked it up and put iti n a to go box. When they brought the meat back to the table, she said there was a little extra kimchi and rice for us.  About a quart extra!!!   I've never wanted to hug the staff after a meal before yeaterday.  If you don't go eat here you're screwing yourself over."}
{"text":"This time they really went out of their ways to please me.  I brought my $20 Groupon for sushi (Rainbow and Catepellar roll).  That was decent.  What really stood out this time was their raw oysters which is being offered at 3 for $5.  The texture of ponzu, scallions, and presentation on iced bed rivals best restaurants with much higher price tags.  A true gem that deserves recognition."}
{"text":"Not too much of a recent review as my visit was back in June 2015.

My family and I decided to stop here as our last meal before going back to California. The place was so tucked away that we almost missed it. Parking in the plaza is plentiful.

Inside the restaurant it was very dim and dark. I suppose it's nice if you're in to the whole lounge-modern thing, but to me it just felt like they just didn't want to turn on the lights until it got darker...

My family was a party of at least 12. Service was DEFINITELY slow. Our drinks got refilled maybe once? The staff here spent their time talking to each other at the front desk and in the back than properly serving their customers.

Food was decent. My aunt ordered for everyone so I can't tell you the exact items we got, but everything was mediocre and nothing was that flavorful. Fried rice, stir fry noodles, bulgogi, pork belly... I think the best thing we tried was the sashimi and cucumber salad which I wish was a bigger portion."}
{"text":"Ok. I came here because of a groupon special. The first time I went - i didn't end up using my groupon. The \"happy hour\" food is cheap enough, so I saved it. Here's the thing, the food is amazing. It's absolutely delicious. the service was good. However there wasn't many people in the place at the time.. Which is why I decided to go back, and bring my boyfriend. 

This second time around the service was epically terrible. So bad it felt like we were purposely discriminated against. We sat down and there was about 4 tables in there when we walked in and then while we were sitting two more tables were sat. So, about 7 tables in the whole place. To start off, she didn't bring the sushi list, which is no big deal except that when I asked her for it she seemed annoyed. So, she drops it off, and then scurries away. We pick our items and it takes her another 20 minutes to come back and get it. After that she brought our waters, 10 minutes later... we waited, and waited, and waited for our 4 items of sushi. All the while, the other tables were getting their silverware, their waters refilled, their napkins, etc. She finally, after another 30 minutes, brought half the order of food over and dropped it off to go attend to other tables. She literally left the food- no silverware/chopsticks, no plates, no napkins, no soysauce dishes.. nothing. So we sat there for about 5 minutes waiting. She didn't return. She just kept running around to the other tables to check up on them.  I finally asked her if she could bring us some plates- she seemed annoyed. She brought the plates and chop sticks... No napkins, no sauce dish. And we were still missing an order. So I got up and got our napkins and our sauce dishes. She saw me and let out an \"OH\" and kept walking. We ate. The food is great. She never once came by check up on us, fill up water, etc.. nothing. Now, this is the shitty part- the food is delicious... like really good.  But the service is crap. So, we waited a while for her to bring the check. It never happened. Even when we were trying to make eye contact it's like she purposely wouldn't look at us. Then, my boyfriend finally did make eye contact and give her a head nod, she still didn't come by. He had to wave her down and ask her for the check. 

Now, I don't know what her problem was- we weren't rude. We weren't demanding. But, we did notice that we were the only table that wasn't of Asian dissent or didn't have at least one person of Asian dissent. I don't know if this is just seeking out an odd reason for this lack of service, but I can't think of any other reason. The last time I went was great, granted it wasn't busy. We left her a good tip. So, it wouldn't be anything that has to do with something I've done or we've done. It was just very poor customer service. So, because of that I will never go back... despite how delicious the food was."}
{"text":"The one thing I hate about Phoenix... Nothing ... NOTHING is open late. So when your craving for Korean bbq kicks in you're left sad thinking nothing is open. But then we found ohya at 12am! They even had my personal fave yogurt soju!!!! I would have given 5 starts but the prices a little high and they need to get better ventilation in the place because it gets pretty smokey in there with all the grills going. The server was great very attentive and nice. Will definitely be back for one of our late need k bbq cravings"}
{"text":"The only 2 words I know in Korean are \"bulgogi\" and \"bibimbap\" so coming here was quite appropriate. I've been here many times and the food is great! However, bulgogi bibimbap does start to get boring after the 10th time. I should really learn some other words.

Twice a month they have Korean BBQ nights, where they pop open the grills and you order as much meat as you can eat in 1.5 hours. I find that the time limit is less of an issue if you eat it raw, but I also find that eating it raw is more of an issue. The price is more than what you would pay for a normal Korean meal, but less than what you would pay for the actual cow they got the meat from, so I'd say it's pretty fair.

They play Kpop music all the time, which is great because I used to love Kpop. Unfortunately, Kpop is synonymous with Gangnam Style for 90% of Americans, so I try not to break out in dance when GEE GEE GEE GEE BABY BABY comes on. Also I am not a dancer, but that's okay because according to The Killers, I could still be human.

Towards the back of the restaurant are several private karaoke rooms, where you can channel your inner Mariah Carey. The last booth of the restaurant shares a wall with the first karaoke room, so you can hear things coming from the other side. If you are sitting in that booth, you can quite literally hear Adele say Hello from the other side.

I am always satisfied with my experience OHYA. If you are not full by the time you finish your meal, then you need to learn how to order more food. I have had diarrhea after eating here before, but that's just me on a Tuesday.

------------------

Best Korean restaurant that I know of in the area. Great for friends/family! 5/5"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I go to ASU, went here between classes for lunch and was more then satisfied with the food, price, and service."}
{"text":"Seriously I literally just left there its valentines day, and my son is sick so I went there for a togo order of sushi (literally 3 rolls) now I want you to ask about how long should that take for a togo order? 15-20 minutes for a restaurant that isn't really all that busy. I ordered my food (btw the waitress was incredibly nice and the ONLY saving grace at this HOLE of a restaurant.)   And after 20 mintues of waiting I asked the waitress if I could get an ETA, as i was now getting pressed for time. I watched her walk over to the \"sushi chef\" and ask him and then I was FLOORED to see how he reacted, I don't want to cuss on this site for the sake of the readers but to see a grown man start yelling at this poor girl in the restaurant in front of customers was unacceptable. So the server came back and told me that it would take another 30 minutes for my food&^$#%^*&^ are you kidding me. So I told her to cancel the order and refund my money to my card I am not waiting 60 minutes for a couple pieces of sushi...especially after seeing people who came in after me get their meals and their sushi.  This so called sushi chef is clearing and incompetent &^$$wad who has to compensate for his inadequacies by berating a  woman. I have a couple choice words for this place...1 you will never get any business from me again (even though the korean isn't that bad) 2. GTFO of the restaurant business if you are going to treat people this was especially your server.


I have eaten here before and their sushi is mediocre at best but it was the closest sushi place to my house and seeing how I was basically just getting california rolls how bad could they screw up.

Yeah I am man and right now I am giving my opinion on what I saw it was ridiculous.  please for the love of people patron somewhere else"}
{"text":"I can see why people love this location better than their scottsdale location. First off, they seem to have more authentic Korean dishes. We try ordering the pork bone potatoe stew but they were out that night. So we decided to order few bbq dishes. 
They have all you can eat bbq Monday thru Wednesday here; however, We didn't want to overeat so decided on galbi, beef tongue, and lamb. All the meat were really tasty and they gave us very generous portions. 
The staff were very attentive and came by often to check on us. Also noticed the staff were all Korean as opposed to their scottsdale location. 
The nakji dolsot was very spicy and saucy. Although i like spicy food, I would pass on this next time and stick with bbq.
The grill is also very easy to control as they have knobs on top of the tables. However, I did notice the grill was unevenly heated. One side was hot while the other side was warm. Once we figured this out, it was easier to cook the meat on one side and move to the other side to keep warm. 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Terrible service tonight.  We have been go to Ohya for about 10 years, before they even called Ohya.  The young waitress didn't even want to give us side dishes since we only ordered two dinner entrees.  And we didn't order Korean dishes.  FOR GOODNESS SAKE YOU ARE A KOREAN RESTAURANT !!! When we asked for our Favorite potato side dish, she said they don't have it.  And later she brought it to the table next to us.  Don't think we will be back again.  If that's how they treat their customers depending how much they spend !!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here from a recommendation from a friend! WOW! Great sushi, California Roll, D Backs Roll, Dynamite Roll, and Latin Lover Roll! All amazing!!! Even our non sushi loving friend had the Yakisoba with Chicken and it was delicious! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"While on a recent adventure with a childhood friend, we decided we wanted Korean BBQ.  We normally frequent other establishments but a while back, someone had told me about this place.  So by chance, we stumbled upon Chuhgajib.

During our an hour and a half extravagant lunch, we were the only ones in there.  I normally try to stray away from barren restaurants but we were already spotted by the owner.  He had sat us down in a very artistic yet uncomfortable table and that's when our feast began~

- Haemul Pa Jun [Seafood and Veggie Pancake]:  The haemul pa jun was delicious!  It had the most amazing dipping sauce and was quite a large dish.  I've had various kinds of kimchi pancakes at other Korean BBQ places but I think this place probably tops the cake with better dipping sauce.

- Jap Chae [Stir-fried Glass Noodles with Vegetables]:  The jap chae was pretty standard.  It had a lot of vegetables and stayed insanely hot throughout our meal.  

- Bulgogi [Marinated BBQ Beef]:  Like the jap chae, their bulgogi was pretty standard.  I did enjoy the sauce that they marinated the beef in.  It was very flavorful and cooked to perfection!

Overall, Chuhgajib is a pretty nice place --- not my favorite but not too shabby!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been here but my son wanted Korean BBQ so we made the trip. The PRO was that our sushi came fast and it was tasty. I ordered two California rolls and two Spicy tuna rolls. At the same time I ordered a beer for my dad, a Combo to grill myself and a noodle dish. By the time our group of 6 finished the sushi, the rest of the food and beer had not come. We waited and waited. We tried to flag down one of the 3 waitresses but they never looked at us. It's the 4th of July and it wasn't that busy. Turns out they didn't put our order in. The waitress apologized and told us she'll be giving us a 15% discount and offered a free appetizer. We ordered the Gyoza. After another 15 minutes they brought us the Combo so we can start grilling. The gas had been turned on since we placed the order 30mins ago and by the time we started cooking the gas ran out. Again, we tried to flag down a waitress and it took another 5 minutes to get their attention and get more gas for the burner. The stir fry noodle came out while they were changing the gas and so did the Gyoza. The Gyoza was fried and was too hard to really enjoy. We finally finished our meal but the beer never showed up. Blah. When the bill came we saw the 15% discount but was also informed that because we were a party of 6, an automatic 15% gratuity was placed on our bill. It was a wash. The meat was marinated well. The sushi was good. However, the lack of service will keep me from coming back. I guess I need to find another place."}
{"text":"My mouth is on fire from the delicious Nakji Bokum, and I can cool it down with my choice of Hite, OB or Cass! This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I was simply not impressed. Prices for what you get don't quite match up. The food was average. The music was odd and loud. My friend says she goes for dinner where they get to cook their own food on the hot plate at the table. 

I got a seafood stew. The seafood was sparse. The broth was not that great.

The radish plate as a free starter was nice and tasty, but it would be nice if each person got their own instead of having to share the tiny amounts."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place a few times in the past few years.  It's okay, but I don't think I'll go back unless I hear they did some cleaning and maybe paid attention to the quality and freshness of the side dishes.  The kimchi was off (old).  Service was pleasant, quick.  Price is good.  We had bibimbap and it was good.  The tables need some serious cleaning and when you start to look around, you see the whole place needs a good cleaning, no doubt because of the bbqs."}
{"text":"good korean bbq! i have been going to this place for several years now and i must say that they still retain their magic. for the bbq, you can either cook the meat and they do it for you. they also serve sushi rolls, appetizers and variety of soups and noodles. i especially like their E5 beef stew clear noodle soup. if you are looking for entertainment, they also have a bar and  karaoke rooms. their staff are friendly and helpful as well. i definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were regulars at this place for their great happy hour food and drink specials and $5 sake bombers! The service is poor. Sitting in the bar area, we already know we need to immediately ask someone for service, otherwise they will ignore us and come and go without giving a second glance. It's too bad they do not treat their regular customers better. If you are sitting on the restaurant side, it's a little better in terms of service. We've done both sides but mostly we go to the bar for the happy hour specials, which are quite good. I wish I could give more than 2 star but I can't just help remembering all the times we were either ignored or waited at the bar for a ridiculous amount of time. Our last 2 visits, we ended up walking out and heading to another sushi joint not too far away which also has all day happy hour, $5 sake bombers and fortunately for us, really great customer service. Unlike Oh-ya."}
{"text":"Let me just say don't waste your money here on Korean bbq. 

I am Korean and I love Korean bbq. I just had it and was really disappointed. 
The bulgogi was bland. The supposed kalbi they give was just bone with fat. BONE with a small slab or fat around it. That's the part that is usually what is left after the real kalbi is eaten. And the jumulok was not even close to what it is supposed to be. It reminded me of jerky with marinade. That meat is supposed to be tender and juicy. Not dry and tough. 

We also had the ddokbokkee. It looked amazing but it did not taste good. 

To top it off, I got an upset stomach from it all. We cooked the meat well and it was definitely not our cooking methods. 

I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Having dined here multiple times, I can conclude that the level of quality in their Korean dishes is sub par.  I had high hopes that they would deliver great tasting Korean dishes but having had some great places in Cali, it's just not the same.  Maybe I should scale down my standard when it comes to Phoenician Asian dining? Of course.

Sadly, I've enjoyed their sushi a tad more, but not that much more. 

On certain nights, the place can either be close to empty or respectably \"busy.\"  The service is nothing to write home about.  Sometimes they will come by and ask how things are and fill your water cup or sometimes not at all.  This is just one of the few areas that can be improved upon.

Despite all of that, they do have something cool that some folks might enjoy and that is Karaoke! From my understanding, if you come to dine, they will give you the first hour free.  The rooms look great for hosting a get together.  You have surrounding speakers and screen to satisfy your singing crave. Haha.

The overall decor is modern.  It has a clean finish with LCDs playing K-Pop music videos.  The Sushi Bar has sports on, so that's perfect for game day!

Luckily, I live close to here, so if I need a quick Korean fix, I wouldn't mind making a return.  Perhaps, I'll host a Karaoke event one day as well."}
{"text":"On the spur of the moment we decided to try some Korean BBQ. Went with someone that had been to many a Korean BBQ, and the rest of the family.
Let's start off with service. There are only two women there doing the serving and yes it is a little slow, I will take slow service with a smile and a good attitude any day. 
Now to the main event.....the food. I don't know what they use to season the meat but all I can say is YUM. The Korean salad I could have eaten all day long and still wanted more. The kimchi was perfectly delicious and quite the treat. 
Now to the experience. It was fun and drew out people that normally sit in a restaurant and eat with very little conversation.
Summary: fun, yum, happy service, a new regular is born."}
{"text":"I have tried the majority of the Korean restaurants in this area and this one by far is the most authentic and the most pleasant on several levels.

The food is delicious and the serving sizes are decent - not huge, not small, but just right. The decor is very entertaining, with tables literally made from trees. The menu includes food made to order or you can also grill. Either way I love it. The service is good and the people are always pleasant. The two best parts about this place, however, are the fact that they frequently have groupons, and they have a tv in the corner which is always playing Korean tv. 

I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"It was okay, I'd eat there again.
We ordered the Korean BBQ plate of meat good for 4+ people for $70.00

Pro's: 
We were full at the end and was more than enough
Fresh meats, great tasting
Fun to cook your meats and eat it right off the grill
Friendly server 
Quick service 
Reasonable prices 

Con's:
No vegetables included! Just onions and a few mushrooms
No dipping sauces included (we made our own with the table soy sauce and by asking for teriyaki sauce and sriracha sauce)
Very small serving of rice is provided - we had to eat it slowly to last the whole meal. 
Very small table, got crowded quickly with all the different types of plates"}
{"text":"Ok. So I LOVE Ohya, I recommend it to all of my friends and clients, but recently the service has been really putting a damper on the whole experience. Usually, the food is so good that the mediocre service isn't even an issue, this time however the food and service were just not up to par with how Ohya used to be. The service starting off was okay, we got our drinks quickly, but after that we didn't really have a particular server, we had to keep asking random servers that passed us for things like, refills, napkins, sauces, lettuce, etc we didn't even get rice with our meal until we asked for it when usually it just comes. We had to ask for the check and ask for the check to be picked up. It just seemed like no one was available to help us with anything. Ohya would be 5 starts for sure if the servers and staff were just trained more. The food wasn't what I'm used at Ohya, the  was cut into weird triangles that weren't good at all, it was way too thick and took almost the entire time we dined to cook and be crispy. Everything else was perfect though. I'm sorry I had to leave a review!!"}
{"text":"When I walked in we were greeted instantly. The place smelled a bit like a hole in the wall but nevermind that. We were happy to come in to happy hour. Galbi for $11.95. Whoop! Thankfully we were the only people there because there was only one server. I ordered the galbi and parents ordered the bulgogi. They also ordered a mango and mocha boba. Ten minutes in more people trickled in. and then this is where the service started to get slow. We got our appetizer no problem. Then side dishes. Ten minutes later the entrees were ready. However, it took him 5 minutes to get our rice. 
Another waitress showed up and we thought things would go smoother. We asked for our bobas and her response was \"he's by himself and working on it\".  I didn't like this response considering we had already been there 20 minutes without any drinks we ordered. 

Overall we enjoyed the food but just not impressed with speed and service."}
{"text":"It is difficult to find restaurants that cater to a Paleo diet. Korean BBQ may not be paleo due to the oil but we figured it was close enough for a quick weekend meal. We ordered the pork belly and ribeye which were both delicious. I like to load mine up in lettuce wraps and decorate with the little accompaniments - yum!!! I thought that this place was rather affordable and I will likely try them in the future."}
{"text":"WORST customer service EVER, me, my wife and 4 other friends went there on 7/28.

I haven't seen my friends for a really long time and we are all sushi lovers so I was hoping to have a nice night with them and try a new place

we arrived at 7:00 and was seated at the tablet by the window next to the Bar, we literally waited a whole hour for someone to come see if we need drinks.

and then wait for about 15 mins for the water and drinks to arrive. Finally then we got the menu.
 I noticed that they got all you can eat sushi on that night! I was really excited to give it a try , one of my friend is pregnant so she is trying to eat healthy, she doesn't want to do the all you can eat (understandable).
But then we were informed that the whole table have to all get all you can eat or no one can.
I was not too happy about it but oh well I'll get something else..a little later, my friends got their order in but I need a few more second so I told the waitress to put in their order first (So my friend don't starve to death) and come back for me. 

Then I wait....and wait....and wait...finally! the food arrived before the waitress return to take my order. 

At the end, I have to literally go to out there and hunt down a waitress to get our bill.

This is my first ever Yelp review~I don't usually like to write things online but this is just too bad of an experience for us all~
Honestly, do yourself a favor and do not go there"}
{"text":"My order took the LONGEST to come out and the waitress forgot one of my order! I had to ask about it! 

The squid bibimbap is really really spicy! Trust me when I say this because I love spicy foods. I do not recommend getting mild for this dish if you cannot even handle sriracha or Tabasco. The dish had white rice on the bottom, cucumbers and little squid on top. It had a red spicy sauce over it and also hot chili oil. The dish comes out sizzling in your plate. Overall I would say this dish is 7/10. 

The tofu soup here is really good. I believe it was in spicy but it was not spicy at all! I'd give this one a 9/10.

Now for my favorite of all... The baked scallop sushi... OH MY GOD this roll is yummy! It is a bit pricy though, it was like $3 for 2 nigiri sushi. Well, I guess for Arizona you cannot complain since we are in a desert.. However, from where I'm from (a island in the pacific), they sell a whole roll (8 pcs) for $12. 10/10 would recommend the baked scallop."}
