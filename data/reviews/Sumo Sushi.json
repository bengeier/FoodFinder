{"text":"This is my favourite go to place to get lunch! I get the beef bulgogi dupbap for all of our workers! Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has closed down now in the richmond-chagrin location. They have moved to somewhere else in other city, but they are a small party of a larger sushi buffet and they such now. It was a real shame, this place used to be my favorite place to eat on cleveland."}
{"text":"First time ordering take-out from this place. Easy to order, short wait time, and friendly staff when I arrived to pick up. 
I ordered a spicy salmon/avo roll and salmon sushi. All delicious. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a colleague. There was absolutely nobody else in the restaurant, although a few people came for takeout.

The lunch combos we ordered were HUGE. My colleague had to take half her lunch to go as there the portions were quite larger. The quality of the sashimi was fair. Not bad, but not great either. The sushi chef spent most of his time prepping his \"ready to go\" section of the fridge for the foot traffic.

The bill ended up being $28.50 and we gave him $40.00. He didn't have any money in his tell for change and pulled out his wallet. He didn't have anything for change either, so we had to go next door to break one of our $20's. 

I wouldn't go back as there are literally dozens of other sushi places around this area."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is delicious! Tried the combo platter which came with California, Dynamite and spicy salmon, Miso soup (which came to $13!!) regular size big portions & Green dragon roll (came with a lemon mayo - delicious!)( $12) also really well done! They were great with substitutions and actually gave us extra miso soup at no extra cost since we had extra people at the table.

Great food... and awesome people. Give them a go for sure!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Etobicoke by far. Fresh, delicious, friendly staff, great pricing, fast service. Everything about this place is perfect! Highly recommended. Returning customer."}
{"text":"OK, came here a looooong time ago (we talking '07 here peeps) so the times may have changed the place. I came here when they first opened up; I was staying in Beachwood East for a month, was missing Sushi and got a large party of 20-25 people organized from our training group. Luckily I got our hotel to hook up 2 free shuttles to this location, so major drinking of sake bombs did ensue! 

We got a large back private room since our group was so large, it was nice because we did get a bit rowdy after the first couple rounds of sake bombs! (People who left for the bathroom could apparently hear us counting out... ICHI - NI - SAN -SAKE BOMB!!!  XD

They have a decent selection of rolls, the fish was relatively fresh, and service was decent. They seemed short staffed but they did just open so that might have been the issue. They did mess up one order, but for a group of 20+ people this isn't bad at all! What did suck is they charged us for the messed up order because one roll was eaten before realizing their mistake so -1 point.

Overall, only an OK place for food, relatively pricey for the quality and portions. Sushi Rock may be a good alternative."}
{"text":"Went here for takeout, and was greeted with smiling friendly faces, the lady said she also gave extra Maki for the platter and free miso soup! We ordered a platter for 4, and we were able to feed 4 adults, and a teenage boy!"}
{"text":"Don't go here for sushi.  Go to Pacific East, Wasabi or Shuhei even before you go here.  This joint has the most uninspired sushi that I think I have ever seen and terrible service to go with it.

We stopped here three times for lunch to give the joint a fair shake.  The place is never even close to full and it is not because of the location- it's because when you leave there you never feel so great.  Who knows why, it's just what happens.

I get the concept that the sushi here is less expensive than other restaurants in the area.  That's fine.  Stop in a Whole Foods or Heinens where they have the dude behind the counter rolling up some fresh rolls cheap.  Buy a Sprite on the way out and you'll be better off."}
{"text":"I went here looking for the $20 special on Friday night and wasn't able to find it. There were no signs, menu items or water mentions of the special. We ordered less than $20 of sushi each, so it ultimately ended up not mattering.

I really left feeling very meh. The food was nothing to write home about. The booths encouraged you not to sit in them for too long. The service was as expected.

The highlight of my experience there was having a young boy befriend us with a paper airplane and tossing it back and forth with him."}
{"text":"I live 5 minutes away and am disappointed I haven't visited this place sooner. Best sushi in the area. The sashimi just melts in your mouth. Workers (owners?) are very warm and friendly."}

I think Karen did a good job describing this place.  The all you can eat part is probably the key idea.  I came here on a Sunday night, and the tai, saba and hikkigai I had were moderately fresh.  Tuna was also moderately fresh.  The only fish that I had that \"kept\" well was probably the salmon.

Results were much better with the crispy, cooked stuff... crunchy shrimp, soft shelled crab.

I have an intellectual problem with the idea of all you can eat sushi -- namely ... how do you make a profit?  Well, you can make the fish thinner per cut, you can get cheaper fish, and you can increase the bulk of the rice you serve with the fish.  I think all three go on here to some degree.

All the same, it's not bad.  It's a lot better than I expected based on the business model.

Note:  This is a chinese run place... don't expect to use much japanese."}
{"text":"I was on a road trip, when I stopped in Cleveland to have lunch with my good friend. This time she took me to Sumo Sushi for their lunch specials.

Good prices on a lot of my favorite rolls!! The quality wasn't outstanding, and there wasn't much variety. But this remains a solid sushi establishment, and I'd be happy to go back next time I'm in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi place on the lakeshore - great place to stop in for lunch or dinner. Friendly staff and good food."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Etobicoke! They have a grab-and-go style cooler which is freshly stocked during just prior to peak times, with common favourites (seaweed salad, dynamite roll, california roll, etc.). When placing a fresh order: rolls are being prepared as soon as you place your order and are usually completed within 5-10 mins. Price point is fair. We've always been happy with the taste, quality, and fresh ingredients. Our typical order is a combination of 3 different rolls & 1 order of spring rolls for 2 people, or we get a party tray when we have company (3-4 people). It's the extraordinary service & smile that has made us regulars here. On only our second visit, we were greeted with a big smile and \"hello again!\". I believe the chef & server are the owners, and they always go out of their way to make the customers feel welcome and satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss in terms of service.  They have a great lunch special, but it can be an hour and a half before you get your order in, or you're rushed through your meal in 20 minutes.  

I would venture elsewhere if time is of the essence.  If you have time to spare, the food is a great deal for the amount you get."}
{"text":"Great potion and taste with great price! Finally lakeshore has some sushi takeout place if you happened not to prepare dinner."}
{"text":"I come here for the 10 dollar lunch special which includes 3 roll+soup+salad.  The quality of the sushi is pretty good.  The AYCE for 20$ is ok. Watami in Parma is a much better AYCE experience but that is a far drive. Any how,  the service pretty much sucks. If you do not want details skip to the bottom.

 Here are a few examples:  I called and was told they stay open till 10:00 PM. I get there start the ACYE and at 9:00 PM they tell me the sushi bar is closing, after arguing for a few moments I ask to speak to a manager, and they advise they will make the rest of what I want.  Next , I call at 2:30 and order carry out ,   The girl on the phone tells me I have to be there before 3 PM since that is when they close. I ask to speak to a manager and she tells me there is none.  I advise i may or may not be there at 3 PM and hang up.  I come in at 3 PM and  there are 2 tables of customers eating and pick up my food. Next, I had called one day to  confirm lunch hours and they stated they were open till  3 PM.  We arrived at 2:40 PM and were told they were closed.  I asked to speak to the manager and was told they were not in. Other obvious service flaws are  waiting 5 minutes for water refills when not busy, not understanding English, not serving bowls of fried rice that are on the menu, blah, blah, blah.  So as you can see the service is poor at best. This is one of the most affluent areas in greater Cleveland, this place may not make it with this type of service.  

So if you want a cheap lunch I say go for it, if you want  AYCE sushi for 20$ go for it. However, if you are going to drop some cash on Japanese food there are much better choices very close to here."}
{"text":"Sumo would get 4 stars, but the service is horrible. It doesn't matter whether the place is packed or there are only 3 people in the entire place it will take 10-20 minutes for a waiter to come to your table. The sushi is not the greatest, but it is not the worst. You have to remember that you are in Cleveland and most the fish has to be shipped in and at least it is a day old. The 20 dollars all you can eat is a good value. All and all an okay spot for being in Cleveland away from the east or west coast."}
{"text":"We were disappointed when we got here since the listing had said buffet. So, we ordered a sushi appetizer to test the quality. It was quite good so we stayed and ordered sushi. We also has the calamari appetizer. The calamari came with an eel sauce. Both were delicious! The sushi came right after, nicely prepared and presented. All three special rolls we ordered were excellent. We will come back. It's just too bad it's an hour from home or we'd come more often. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food. Great place to be.
Every time I visit here. the chef welcome and smile. It makes me happy. Really recommend."}
{"text":"My favourite little sushi place on lakeshore, not really meant for a sit down meal but provide good and fat service for takeout! Really good prices too."}
{"text":"-I went here on a recommendation from someone who is Japanese-American, who knows good sushi when he sees it.

-The sushi here is quite good, very fresh and flavorful

-They have an all-you-can-eat menu, for around 20 dollars per person on Friday, Sunday, and Wednesday, BUT.... service is verrrrrry slugggishhhhh... especially if you are starving and want sushi now!

- Also, they are very restrictive about what you are allowed to get, so it's more like all-we-choose-for-you-to-eat 

-For instance, each person is only allowed 2 special rolls (although their regular rolls are still unlimited), and if you do not finish your sushi by the end of your meal you will be charged the regular price for it.  Ouch!  I mean, I can see how it's a good policy to eliminate waste, but to be charged the full price of a roll (which is around 10 dollars) for leaving one piece on your plate?

- So, the food itself is good, I'd say 4 stars, but since I was turned off by their all-you-can-eat policies and slow service, minus one star.

-Oh, and they have really cute earrings and necklaces for sale at the front counter.  I was tempted to buy some earrings, but, after waiting a minute and seeing that they weren't even going over to the counter to answer the phone while I was there, I decided I can live without earrings bought from a Sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has rejuvenated my love for local restaurants. The servers are incredibly pleasant and sweet, they've given me free Miso soup multiple times. The actual sushi is made with fresh fish and a nice soft rice, the prices are excellent. Only complaint being the menu selection. They kind of only have classic  rolls, and the vegetarian section is lacking. I suggest the sumo roll!"}
