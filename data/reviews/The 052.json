{"text":"Food is delicious! I ordered a med-well cheese burger, and it was juicy, flavorful and cooked to perfection. The onion rings are awesome also. Everything was great. I will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Solid gaming, locals bar. Most of the clientele is older but very friendly for the most part. Bartenders are great and know how to handle gamers! Plenty of TV's and food is solid!"}
{"text":"Chilling with the GF and thought we would grab a bite to eat at the Firefly.  As we made our way up the stairs we spied the entrance to 052 and thought we would stop in for a pre-lunch beverage.  As our eyes adjusted to the darkness, I began to notice the bar, Tv's, and an older crowd playing the video poker machines.  There was a certain stillness and quite to the establishment at 1:00 in the afternoon.  One could only imagine the intensity amplified by close quarters of a \"basement\" bar... if this place goes off at night.  There is no drink menu (but have a full bar) and the food menu seemed non nondescript but the bartender was super friendly.  After a beer for me and a raspberry cider for the GF we punched out."}
{"text":"This is a pretty regular dive bar. It is located under Firefly on Eastern near Anthem. When we came in (weekday afternoon), the place was understandably nearly empty. There were two other (obviously retired) people in there playing video poker and listening to country music. The bartender was very nice. If you put in $20 into the poker machine you get free drinks. I had no idea and only put $10 but he still honored it gave us free drinks. I had my usual Jameson and Ginger, and he did not skimp on the shots. There is a jukebox machine, several flat screen TVs, video poker at every seat and ATM machine inside for your gambling convenience. The restroom was clean and there were no visible issues with the bar from what I could tell. It just definitely looks and feels like a bar for the much older crowd."}
{"text":"I called in a order at 8:30pm, about 5 minutes later the restaurant called me saying she just sent her cook home sick so there's nobody to make my order??? This place is open until 2am. There's no restaurant in the world that wouldn't have a manager that would stand in to cook and what restaurant has one person in the back cooking? Not a bar that's forsure. I'm absolutely shocked, I work at a restaurant and I feel like this lady just straight up lied to me for absolutely no reason"}
{"text":"Went here to watch a football game. 4 bottled beers came to 22 bucks!  Excuse me, no football drink specials, or perhaps a happy hour.  I was also playing video poker and didn't even get a comp.  Also, if you at all are allergic to mold, do not come here, the place reeks like mold!"}
{"text":"Great bartenders
Very homey
It is definitely not a fancy place but people in there are friendly. There food is decent too."}
{"text":"Cool place. Rick the bartender is awesome. A little bit of a twist on the classic Vegas gaming bar. The food is top-notch bar fare. Ordered some Mac n Cheese bites, which came with some jalape√±os on top. Delicious.  Western Burger was also great. Huge burger with tons of toppings. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"great place to grab a drink. Eddie is the best bartender. Period."}

{"text":"This is a fab locals bar! It is a cozy, everyone knows you type of place! The bartenders are awesome, espcially Rick,  he makes great drinks and is always in a great mood! The food here is also fantastic, they have several great theme nights, with homemade tasty goodness! This is one of the best places to watch the games, TV's in every direction, and specials, make sure to get the 052 App to keep you up to date on all the fun happenings. My husband I love to come here....Make sure to say hi to the owner Angela if she is there, she is a total doll ! Gamblers bonus is available here for all you gamblers."}
{"text":"I'd been here years ago when it was another name/ownership.
I came this time for the free meal when you play $20 coupon from Zip Code mag. 
I had a Cobb salad, it was just OK. The bacon was burnt and there was nothing very tasty about it, but the dressing was good. 
Lots of smokers (I know it's a poker bar....) just pointing that out. Older clientele and they have a Saturday gaming promo from 6-8. Decent Gamblers Bonus games."}
