{"text":"Rude waitress and slow service. No offers for upgrades like cheese on pasta or check ins on the food. Paper menu doubles as the placemat and you must seat yourself as well as add your own condiments one little packet at a time. Water was warm and waiters stood around chatting while our cups were empty. When tip was low due to mutiple failings the waitress thought it was her duty to advise us she expected 15% regardless."}
{"text":"Located right ourside the Berri-UQAM metro, this sports bar is everything you expected of a casual sports bar. We were promptly seated. Food and beer was relatively cheap for being in the downtown area. Service is a bit slow, and the food is not spectacular, but there are a lot of options. I had beef stroganoff with soup and dessert costing me around 10$. Another plus is that they have TV screens everywhere so everyone at the table can enjoy the game. The service was very accommodating. I even saw a table playing a board game. Overall, if you're looking for a place to hangout, with cheap food and beer."}
{"text":"Always a great place to have a decent meal Prices are more than fair and the portions are huge. Great place to hang out with friends or just to have a drink. Would recommend to others"}
{"text":"The atmosphere felt like a a school dining hall rather than a sports bar and whilst the game was on, we could hardly see the screens.  Choice of beer seemed reasonable and the prices were OK - however what was so unacceptable and reaffirmed that I would not return to this place was that the waitress actually told us to tip her, and made us feel guilty about not wanting to leave one due to the pretty poor service. I feel her attitude was poor and felt we were rushed as patrons. Also, how can a bar operate with a single toilet for everyone? Montreal has much better places to drink, do yourself a favour and go find them."}
{"text":"Un bar vraiment sympa pour y boire un verre , et regarder un match de hockey en soutenant les canadiens ou une autre équipe .. Possibilité d'y manger des assiettes assez copieuse à ce que j'ai pu voir , l'ambiance y est sympas surtout les soirs de match les serveurs et serveuse vous mettes très vite a l'aise . On sympathise assez vite avec le personnel quelques fois un peu débordés , mais vous pouvez toujours proposez de l'aide au risque de les faire sourirent ^^ Je le recommande pour profiter des soirée spéciales ."}

{"text":"Great spot.  LOTS of TVs.   I mean LOTS of TVs.   Big menu.   Good (not great) beer selections.  Outstanding value on beers.  BIG pitchers at very reasonable prices.    Excellent service despite being very very busy.   Right downtown."}
{"text":"Si vous voulez aller en  famille regarder la game des canadiens de Montréal avec vos enfants vous allez être refusé à l'entrée. Je voulais simplement regarder le match avec famille et amis. Ils ne comprennent pas le concept de resto/bar. JE SUIS VRAIMENT DÉÇUE! Je donne ce RESTO/BAR 0 ÉTOILES!! Merci."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service is ok. Nothing to rave about but if you want to watch sports, this is the place to be"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast. The food being served to others looked decent but the service was horrible. After three or four waitstaff and at least 20 minutes we got coffee and then were told the kitchen stopped serving breakfast.  The place was not busy and seemed over staffed but apparently clueless about actual service."}
{"text":"Why Yelp delete my Review????!!!! You really disappoint me and I will repost every time you delete it, Yelp!!!!!  On October 17th, about 10pm. I went to the restaurant \"La Station Des Sports (2051, rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest)\" with my friend. I just finish my work out and holding my milk shake in my hand. After sit in, I put my milk shake on the table (I was not even drinking it) and waiting for the menu. After about 2 minutes, before we got served, the restaurant bouncer jumped into my face and started yelling at me!! (He is white, short hair, about 1.80 meters tall, strong and wearing a black jacket). He called himself the \"manager\" of the restaurant and asked me ''What The F**K Is That??!!\" (my shake). I replied \"It's my shake.\" He then kept screaming at me saying \"This is a F**King Restaurant and you shouldn't bring that!! Order a beer!!\" I thought he was drunk and joking with me and I said\"I don't understand.\" He then got even more mad, and kept yelling\"This is how the F**King business is doing!! When you come in we want  you to order food and drink from our restaurant and not to bring your own! Just put it in your F**King Bag!!\". He is spitting all over my face! I asked him \"you wanna us to leave?\" He said \"No, just put it in you F**King bag!!\" I don't understand why he behaves like a mad dog, and felt very unhappy about him. I decided to leave with my friend. Before we got to the front door, he blocked us with another bouncer. He started to yelling at us again\"No, No, I don't wanna you to leave. Just put that F**King thing in your bag!\" While he was yelling, he was dragging my bag on my shoulder heavily and threw it on the floor. I questioned him \"when did I allow you to touch my bag?\" He used his finger pointing on my face and abused me \"F**K YOU!! F**K YOU!! F**K YOU!!\" He repeated that at least 3 times!! I stopped talking and turned to the door and walking out. When I was about to get the door, I gave my finger to him without looking at him. Then I hear that he ran up to me and attacked me heavily from behind. He pushed me so heavily such that I almost fell on the ground. After I stood up and turned back, the other bouncer was already in front me and pushed me again. (He is brown, 1.70 meters high, strong, has short mohawk hair and a small pinch of mustache on his chin.) We were  on the side walk and he kept pushing me fiercely on my chest and yelling at me \"Just keep F**King Walk!!\". Every time he pushed me I was forced to back 3 steps. He kept pushing me like this from the door to the Du Fort street, and he intimidated me \"I WILL BEAT YOU ON THE GROUND!!!\" After this, we called 911 right away. The police arrived in 20 minutes. We told them what happened. Then they went to the first bouncer asked him his version of story. There were so many witnesses, it was a packed night, and HE LIED TO THE POLICE!! I bet, if you go to ask him about what happened that night, you will hear a totally different story from what I said here!! This is how their security guys you hired treat their customers in your restaurant. I've been in Canada for 4 years and I never cook. I always eat in restaurants. But this is the first time I was being treated like this!! My friend who was with me that night recommended that place to me. And we used to like it lot! And I was also thinking to recommend the restaurant to my friends. But now, both my friend and I will never step in that place ever again! I heard that the owner of the restaurant is very successful, but I think I will never go to the other restaurants he owned. Besides, I am sharing my experience at your restaurant on the internet, all the customer rating sites that I can think of. I have sent their head office an email and received response this morning. They apologized and transferred the message to the security department. I was also told that investigation is undergoing and they will let me know their decision if they will let these guys stay with them. But this still cannot calm me down. I'm still making effort to share my experience at their restaurant. So, if you see this post, please share this \"hilarious\" story with your friends! It can be just for fun! I don't mind some laughter on my experience, I just wanna more people to know it. Really appreciate your share!"}
{"text":"Sports Station is what every bar would look like if the Germans had won the war."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, fast service and good food. Worth a trip."}
{"text":"Breakfast is quick, good and cheap.  Outdoor patio is great, feeling like you're having a drink in the middle of Saint Catherine Street. Avoid Saturday lunchtime.  We waited over 45mins to get a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, Service, and Food: That's how my organize my Reviews.  Atmosphere: The Station was once a fun place to go, sadly that's only the case some of the times, and only during certain times of the day.  Best time to visit is early morning - if you like to catch a game of football, because there aren't many customers and the volume level isn't deafening.  With a lower crowd comes better services (the waitresses aren't as frazzled) and better food (the cook isn't just sling ingredients).  Place could use a little more clean up - it getting to be a little too run down.  If you don't like the drunken frat scene don't go in during the evenings or during a football or hockey match.  Service: the waitresses and waiters do try - I will give them that much.  Many of them are extremely nice and amicable people who are working the hardest job - in my opinion - with very little reward.  When they are not serving 50 drunken frat boys - they're quite good at what they do and very attentive.  Food: Again, the time of day dictates the food's quality.  It's middling to being with - but great value for the money (get the burger or chicken souvlaki platter, or any of the items for breakfast).  Pub food - so don't expect much, but if you go in on weekend mornings or early noon / brunch - the food is usually fresh and tasty.  Value for Money - but only when you go it at a good time."}
{"text":"I first encountered this spot back in 2011 after visiting Montreal in the summer and looking for a sports bar with cheap beer and a large patio. La Station des Sports offered both of these things and I fell totally in love with the place. You could order a double pitcher of Keith's (120 ounces) for just $16.00. I had never been able to find such a good deal in my entire life.   I typically visit Montreal twice a year and I made a point to visit this place EVERY time I was in town. I actually fell in love with it so much that I started choosing my accommodation based on the walking distance to this bar. It sounds crazy but we considered it \"our spot\".   I say \"loved\" now with a heavy heart. Sadly, the past four or five visits to this restaurant have confirmed the declining quality of the place and I could not be more disappointed. Every time I came back after the first couple years of visiting, I noticed that the prices of their food and alcohol seemed to creep a little bit higher. A 120 ounce pitcher of Keith's now costs $30.50 - almost double what it was five years ago. All of their food items have substantially increased in price as well - their pizza used to be around $6.00 - now it's hovering around $12.00. I also find that the quality of the food has rapidly declined. We ordered calamari and it tasted like someone had doused a rubber band in oil and put it on a plate :-( On my recent visit two days ago I ordered nachos which were okay but not great. My boyfriend complained that his burger was thoroughly overdone and his fries were cold.   Two years ago I came here in the summer to find that their lovely outdoor patio was completely gone due to renovations. They said it would be reintroduced once the renovations were complete. I visited again a few months later, and it was still under construction. Granted, they do have their patio open again, but this was a huge disappointment for me.   Service has always been good, so no complaints there. They also have a ton of TV sets and it really is a fun place to watch any games or sporting events. That's where the positive things end though, really. If you're looking for decent food, look elsewhere.   If you've also been coming here for years, perhaps you will understand my struggle. Although in the past, this place would've gotten five stars from me, I have no choice but to give it a three star rating today. To be honest, that's really being generous, and it would've likely gotten a two star rating had my nostalgia not kicked in midway through this review.   It is with great regret now that I say goodbye to this place and begin the search for a new spot in Montreal."}
{"text":"Happen to stumble into this spot when I stayed at the hotel du fort on my third trip to the city. As a native New Yorker I'm totally picky about my sports bars and I was initially skeptical of La Station but after a few, OK a lot, rounds of Johnnie Walker and some interactions with the friendly bar staff my bud and I were hooked. The prices were pretty cheap for downtown and the food was fine but the reason to hit this spot is for the atmosphere during the sporting events. Very lively crowd during Sunday futbol games. Every time I'm in the city I'm sure to drop in for a double or triple shot of Johnnie Black on the rocks. Say hi to Leila the bartender, Jane the waitress and Eddie the bar hand for me!"}
{"text":"Katherine said it well, cheap and friendly. I've been here twice and have been quite impressed with the place. The beer is really cheap and good price for good quality food. We've had great waitresses both times who seemed genuinely friendly and were funny and helpful. There's various place in Montreal that are more interesting, but this is a solid place good value and a good time with some friends. Tips: The burgers and nachos were great, one of my friends were unimpressed with the poutine. Check out the beer taps on the tables if you have a large group that will drink a lot. And for games, there's TVs all over the walls, but note that prices go up a bit on event nights."}
{"text":"Warning: Just had what be my worst bar experience ever! Upon entering this Sergakis the Slumlord owned establishment I was greated by an agressive ratfaced man who insinuated that I probably had alcohol in my backpack. Then I noticed that this $hithole smelled like what can only be described as \"Fart Water\"!  Don't go here under any circumstances!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience.  Today, gay pride weekend, we went to have a beer and something to eat at this pub. We got a table and a high chair for my 1 year old baby. 10 minutes pass, no service at all. We were ok, the restaurant was kind of busy given the Fierté Festival. However, 10 more minutes pass and the waiter didn't even come to say hello yet he did serve the two tables that arrived after us and were sitting around us. He deliberately ignored us. After 20 mins waisted sitting there, we decided to leave. As we are standing, the waiter sees us and turns his head away.   On our way out, we spoke to the hostess and in a very disrespectful tone answers that it is normal to wait 20 mins. Ok, fair enough, busy night. But how come the tables around us got served before us and we arrived before them?  She ignored this fact and kept on saying that 20 mins wait is acceptable. The guy standing next to her, the floor manager, looked away as well."}
{"text":"Good place to watch a Habs game or any sporting event. I have been to this location a few times with my boyfriend. Service seems to really depend on which waiter, but they are generally friendly. It can of course get pretty busy for weekend games, so there's sometimes a wait for your food and drinks.  Decent priced drinks and good old greasy food, pretty standard for a sports bar. No real complaints."}
{"text":"What a great place to watch a game. The routine was amazing and the 120oz. Beers were even better! While on a bachelor party with 18 other guys, we rolled in on a Sat night on the recommendation of bartender from another bar. They found us a couple of tables together and even put the Bruins game on 2 of their numerous, huge, HDTV's. Their goal light and horn made the atmosphere great when the Habs scored. Our waitress was fantastic, had no problem splitting the bill between the 3 tables. After the party switched from the 4L pitchers of beer to drinks we decided to cash out and couldn't believe how affordable our tabs were. 1 of the best sports bars I've ever been to."}
{"text":"We went here while visiting Montreal for the Women's World Cup and needed a place to watch the USA game. We had checked previously via twitter to make sure they would be showing the match and was assured they would be. My friend that arrived first got us a table, and we were surrounded by televisions that were showing the earlier WWC matches... until they switched all the televisions to a different men's match, despite us being the only ones in that half of the building. It took about 20 minutes for them to get themselves situated and finally put the women's match on that we were there to see - thank goodness we got there early!   The food was, to put it simply, quite underwhelming. I had poutine, which was okay, and my friends ate hamburgers that looked like frozen burgers - and not the good kind of frozen burger. Drinks were expensive and they had a shockingly bad selection of beer.   Go somewhere else to watch a sporting event. Try Cage Aux Sports - they were extremely accommodating to us and the food was way better."}
{"text":"This sports bar has great potential to be as great as the downtown location but seems to be managed very differently.  Sports seem to be less of a priority.  Good service, low prices"}
{"text":"Our adventures began a year and a half ago on our first date at none other than, drum roll please: Sports Station! (for my Frenchies: La Station des Sports)  I know, I know, so classy you could just die LOL!  Well The Beard was new to MTL and had never been there and we wanted something low key, thus we ventured into the vat of beer.     We sat down to watch a UFC fight and I convinced The Beard to order a 4L of Keith's Blond.  \"4L of Beer\" he proclaimed and his eyes lit up with delight.  Uh Oh!  I had unleashed a monster.  Never have I seen someone get so excited about draft beer.     After several visits to SS, I started to look back at everything that we've eaten and drank.  The beer, although probably the cheapest you'll find in the city, is expired tasting and gives me a headache.  I could never understand why I could drink mounds and mounds and never be \"that drunk\" but 2 pints anywhere else and I'm falling on the floor?!  It's watered down, but you're getting what you pay for.     The food if decent, low cost pub food.  I actually really like the steak poutine and The Beard likes the Station Special, an array of appetizers.  If you're gonna be downing that much beer you better line your stomach with some grub first and SS does the trick for that.     Beware of sitting at a table with a beer tap.  Although it seems like it's a good deal, something is fishy about it and we always seem to be paying more than we thought we drank.  You can ask to see the \"book\" to see exactly what amount you did drink, but take my advice and just order pitchers.     They make a pretty good bloody ceaser and for only about 4$ you really can't go wrong.  We also like to knock back a few Jagger bombs, when the night get's going hard.  Decently priced and they give you a real ounce.  I used to want to go because I had fun with the staff, but lately they have changed things up and the new staff isn't as great.  All in all the appeal has gone down.  Maybe it's the fact that I no longer want to get Sh*t faced and face a hangover the next day just for a cheaper bar tab, but I think with all the cool places in MTL, you can save your pennies a couple of days and head somewhere better!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Even the cheese on the top of the nachos was not melted. Greek salad was just a garden salad with a hunk of feta on top. Couldn't figure out the TV's to accommodate the watching of a NHL final game. Isn't this Montreal?"}
{"text":"This is going to be long but bear with me, it might actually be a funny/good read. So, I am local here and I used to go to Sports Station very often for the games and drinks. There was a hockey game on the 22nd of April and decided to go there for it. Made reservations for 10+.  As usual, during a big game night, waiting for your table to be set up is not much of an issue for me, although it was literally placed right in front of the entrance. I did not complain.  So here's where everything starts off, since I came to the place right after work, it would naturally order something to eat. I've ordered the \"filet mignon brochette\" for myself and drinks for the table. Finally arrives approximately 20 minutes I've ordered my dish, as hungry as I am, I start eating. On my second bite, I feel/hear a crack on my upper right tooth. I spit it out and comes out a pebble with my broken tooth...  I ask the waitress to get the manager for me right away, I managed to take pictures of the broken tooth and the pebble during the mean time. The manager comes by and asks me what's going on, I show/tell him what happened and brings me to the side and tells me I don't need to pay for the food... Well... It's pretty obvious taken that I only took two bites and broke my tooth afterwards. While the manager brought me to the side, the waitress managed to take the food away which I didn't get the chance to take a picture of. Basically, my whole night is ruined.  10 minutes after, the manager comes by again asking me to follow him. He takes me to the back where the kitchen is and tells me. \"Perhaps it came from the spice we put on top of the meat.\" I looked at him shocked and confused. First of all, the pebble is approx. 4~5 centimeter in diameter and the spice is less than 1mm. I mean honestly, what difference does it make whether it came from the spice or not?? If in fact it came from the spice, we'd have a bigger problem because the cooks would have definitely felt (apparently they use their hands) the pebble but still served me the plate with the foreign object. Besides, my plate had no seasoning on it anyways.  I explain that to him, then gives me a facial expression telling me I am right. It was time to leave; I take down the managers' name, the name of the other manager who intervened, time of the incident and the name of the waitress. They also gave me a number (headquarters) to call to explain the incident and claim my dental fees which I had to make an emergency appointment the following day.  The next day as I walk out of the dentist, I give them a call, transfers my call to human resources/marketing to explain the incident. A week later, they carry out the case to the director of operations. I have called the director of operations several times so that I may claim the dental fee I am entitled to but never managed to pick up. Also left several messages. 3 weeks later I finally receive a call and had to explain the case all over again. All in all, according to my phone records, I've called them over 25 times and I've received a call from them once. I've given them a month and a half which I think I was being more than fair.  The person responsible for my case made several false promises and claims to get the issue resolved. Of course, the issue is still on going. I wanted to get this issue resolved in a swift/fair manner but never came to a conclusion in the end. All I have demanded was for the dental fees. (It has led me to making 3 other appointments to the dentist due to this incident). In the end, I have decided to sue, which I have.  I have been very patient so far and I am finally posting this here because I think people should know what happens when you deal with people/company like them. It's such an easy problem to resolve with proper communication/cooperation. I have all the evidences in hand and witnesses.  Anyhow, just thought I'd share this unfortunate experience I've had/still dealing with them, not to mention several other incidents which involves my group of party, \"bouncers\" and police officers.  If anyone is curious, I will post final outcome.  Thank you for reading."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar. TVs all over showing many different games. Food is just OK. Wouldn't come back here for a meal."}
{"text":"Service effroyable alors que le restaurant était vide! Bouffe ok pour ce genre d'endroit! Prix raisonnable! Définitivement tres moyen!"}
{"text":"Paradis sur terre pour les amateurs de sports! Comme le bureau est proche, nous y allons régulièrement! (1-3 fois semaine!) Par contre je n'ai pas essayer beaucoup de choses sur le menu! Club sandwich Sports station, Meat lovers pizza et la poutine saucisse sont très bonne!"}
{"text":"They overcharged $41.83 to our table claiming that some people in our party did not pay. They are unprofessional and I would highly recommend anyone looking for a sports bar to stay away from this establishment."}
{"text":"If it was 2010 right now, I'd be giving this place a much better review. I don't know what happened in the last few years but I used to love the sports station whenever I was in town, so I was really excited to go back when we were in town for osheaga a few weeks ago! The first breakfast we ate there was decent, a lot smaller than i remembered, but the service was worse than the food. We went again a few days later and our experience that day is what earned this dump a 1 star rating! No one even acknowledges you when you walk into the sports station, so you just have to assume that you are suppose to seat yourself.. we sat by the open doors to the patio and after a few minutes someone who we assumed to be the manager asked us if anyone had come over to see us yet. we said no, and he didn't say anything else.. 5 minutes later someone finally came over and to make it brief, she was a terrible waitress. She rarely checked on us, was ANYTHING but friendly, and made me want to get out of there as soon as possible. Right before our food arrived, we moved to another table at the back because the breeze got really cold by the window. She brought our food to us, and any time after that that we needed her, we had to literally CALL to her. She didn't pay any attention to us (I should add that there were about 8 people working and 3 tables of customers there).. so helping her one table should not have been an issue. Our toast was cold, the eggs in my skillet were raw, and we were being ambushed by flies!?! We were literally swatting flies away for our entire meal. My boyfriend was nice enough to let me eat some of his breakfast and try to stomach my raw egg skillet.. we barely ate anything, had to request our bills since our waitress (as well as all of the other \"employees\" there) was too busy watching the olympics.... and then she did the ol' \"treat the customers really nice while they're paying so that they tip me even though i gave them terrible service!\"  Needless to say... we will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for a late night meal and some drinks. It is average and there is nothing that really stood out for me. I had a poutine (obviously, when in Montreal..) and a few pints of Stella and although everything was very reasonably priced, I was not impressed.   The service was slow and we didn't have a server visit our table until about 20 minutes after we sat down. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time but it seemed like we were always trying to catch our servers eye and having to wave her down.   Sitting on the patio was fun because we got to people watch and being Pride weekend, there were a lot of interesting outfits. I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at this pub.   My boyfriend and I went here for dinner and drinks on a Pride weekend, and it was packed. (We figured if it was busy, then it must be good.)  The beer was cheap (at least compared to Vancouver, where I'm from), and the food was relatively tasty. I ordered chicken souvlaki and my boyfriend got tilapia fillet. Both were great, especially for pub food.  With your meal, you could get mashed or baked potatoes (which were odd pairings with souvlaki) or fries.   The staff were friendly and bilingual, although I did notice that the service was a little slow at times because of how busy they were.   The tables in the patio were a little close to each other, so this place probably isn't appropriate if you want privacy. If you're in for a rowdy good time, you definitely should visit."}
{"text":"Très sympatique, nourriture tres copieuse et bonne. Ambiance super surtout jour de match.  Attention très (trop) bruyant pour les jeunes enfants. .."}
{"text":"First time in Canada.  Pull into Montreal, got lost, got hungry so parked the rental car on a street corner and walked into the first restaurant I saw.  Happy to find full English speaking staff, english menu and amazing prices for amazing food.  Got the pork souvlaki platter for $7.45.  Beers were around $2-3 per pint.  Plenty of TV's and varioius bar games.  Was there about noon on a Sunday and noticed several others ordering huge breakfast platters.  I didn't see anything at all on the menu over $10 and the portions were huge.  Doubt I'll ever find myself in that part of Montreal again, but would definately recommend to anyone in the area.  Waitress went out of her way to help me orient the local map and point out some easy tourist sites for my 48 hours in town."}
{"text":"Went at like 11pm for a plate of nachos and afew beers... barly any service, which was strange considering the place was close to empty."}
{"text":"Did not expect to see this place on St. Catherine street--in the middle of the gay neighborhood.  Great sports bar with lots of big screens and modern, clean interior....and huge pitchers of beer for pretty cheap price.  Food was A+ too (considering it's a sports bar)."}
{"text":"I had consulted reviews on Yelp before going for a Saturday night Habs game, therefore I knew food service was very slow, and I knew I would not order because of that. Unfortunately, my game experience was ruined by two factors: I had to sit at the end of the bar, where the waiters and waitresses were always doing their drinks, not shy to block my view or pull my beer out of the way. In addition to that, the door close to me was permanently open and the cold fall breeze was always on my ankles making it really irritating.  Finally, the screens blacked out for 5-6 seconds 3 times in a single period.  In brief, my experience was not pleasant and I left after 1 hockey period. I will probably give it another try given its the closest sports bar from my place but it should be their last chance. They better do good."}
{"text":"This is the perfect example of a fail change. Many great menu items are now no longer there, the dishes became pricey and the portions are now ridiculously small.  9$ for a half plate of overcooked calamari, with a dipping sauce that was already half-empty when served... The steak poutine was just disgusting, the sauce was sweet, few grains of cheese curds here and there, and the steak was microwaved. The portion was also incredibly small for bar food.  And don't even get me started in the steak. Yeah, who orders steak in a sport bar, right? Well I was fooled by their \"special steak\" recommended by the waiter. I ordered rare, and they give me well-done, the steak was gray throughout. On top of that, they serve a cold salad on a very hot plate (the entire plate was burning hot for some unknown reason), disgusting.  I am so disappointed :/"}
{"text":"Hype place to be on Saturday. However We were told we would wait 40 minutes for dinner. We finally waited 1:30 for the worst burger ever. Situation absolutely out of control. Thanks god, our waitress was really nice and we had fun anyway."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Food was just not good.  I asked if I could have the double boss burger cooked med rare.  They told me that the burgers are only cooked one way.  Apparently that way is well done/burnt cause I thought I was chewing a rubber hockey puck.  The service was awful.  It took a good 15 minutes to take my order on a slow day.  The burger came without bacon like it was supposed to.  And the burger was one of those too big to actually bite into deals and no extra napkins were provided. After not being able to flag down the waitress, I resorted to stealing napkins off the surrounding tables.    It was cool that they had all the nfl games there, but the one I wanted to watch didn't come in right and would blank out on ever play.  Very frustrating watching a food all game that blacks out as soon as the ball is snapped and then comes back in at the end of the play.  I asked to talk to the manager cause of my burnt burger, the game not working right, and the chip in my glass that cut my lip.  I ask the waitress in the 1st quarter.  Then asked another waitress at grab the manager in the 2nd quarter.  Apparently he was busy cause after asking a 3rd waitress to speak to the manager in the 3rd quarter he still never showed.  By the time the 4th quarter came around, I was so frustrated I left.  I was trying to post this review while I was there but their wi-fi is so shoty, the post wouldn't go through."}
{"text":"The prices have clearly gone up to the now standard 28$ per 4L pitcher *sigh*. The food is still decently priced and won't rob your wallet but it felt...microwaved. Like it was reused food from a client that didn't want their meal anymore and they saved it on the table in case a poor soul (in this case me) decided to order the same thing. THERE IS NO SPACE WHATSOEVER to move around. I felt like I was stuck on the 211 during rush hour. Not many bathrooms for how many this bar tries to seat.  We tried to reserve for 15 and they gave us 2 tables with a total amount of seats of 8... It was 2 weeks in advance and they told us they simply couldn't save up more spots WHEN WE ARRIVED ON THE SPOT 20 minutes IN ADVANCE. Very VERY poor management.  There seems to be also 3-4 waitresses for the whole pub. I could easily tell how tired and overworked they are and tried not giving them too much shit for the BS they pulled on us as I knew it wasn't their fault but certainly the manager's."}
{"text":"Brasserie sportive par exellence au centre-ville. Son succès est construit sur des bases solides. Écrans géants, bière abordable, ambiance survolté lors des matchs et nouriture pas cher et correcte. Un +, cette été ils ont installé une immence terasse et en décembre 2012 des travaux d'agrandissement seront complètés. 4* :: pour se que c'est une brasserie abordable avec une ambiance survoleté les soirs de match. Buvons et festoyons en regardant du sport.     Voici quelques examples: Pichet 60oz 12$ et 120oz 23,50$, menu du jour à 10$, côtes levées 14,95$, filet de saumon 10,25$, poutine 5,95$... ici votre 30$ fait du chemin... ATTENTION éviter les choses trop complexe comme \"le veau parmesan\"...wouach!!! c'est mauvais..... ici restons \"basic\" même animal! Le service est super efficace pour la bière et lent pour la nouriture. Un burger commandé en début de match arrivera en 2em période :( ! Mais bon après un pichet de bonne bière de 120oz on a moin faim non ? ;)  J'y vais surtout lors des matchs du Canadien et je scande avec plaisir Kerry, Kerry, Kerry....  Aussi on y présente basquet, soccer, UFC, football (se sport qui se joue avec les mains), F1, boxe....  Vous êtes un fan fini des Kings de LA ou encore pire des Jets de N-Y ou encore bien pire des Bobcats deCharlotte.Vous croyez être seul au monde. La Station des Sports est l'endroit idéal pour rencontrer d'autres fans de ces obscures équipes sportive... si ils existent... ;) !!!"}
{"text":"With all of the TVs there I thought that this place would be a great match. I was wrong. I arrived in Montreal in the afternoon. I had plenty of time to walk around and see what was out there. This place was really close to my hotel so I thought it would be a perfect match. I wanted to watch the Blue Jays game (game 3 of the ALCS final playoff). I thought that there would be more TVs playing the game. It was mostly soccer, and hockey (which is fine). There were only two TVs playing the game. Small ones at that as well. So I sat as close to the TVs as I could.  I sat for about 15 min without being served. There certainly wasn't a lot of people in there. Then I walked to the other bar to see if I could buy a pint and the person behind the bar said they would be right back.  You guessed it! They never came back. The game was pretty hard to find in the neighbourhood I was in. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday night, hoping to grab a beer before calling it the night. Horrible service and no one bother to serve. Ruined my great impression of Montreal. Don't waste time and money."}
{"text":"Good spot to watch Canadian sports teams. Good food. No English menu. Friendly waitstaff. Unable to watch US sports team. Multiple TVs."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium steak but it was cooked beyond well done. The service was poor as well."}
{"text":"We came here on a big sports night (boxing match, UFC fight, and NBA semifinals) and it was a fun place. We sat at the bar so the service was good, and the bartenders were all friendly. Drinks and some food is a little higher priced on event nights, but the crowd (and free pay per view) makes it worth it. TVs everywhere and I can imagine they'd have every game you could want. Bar food, but good quality and well cooked."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bit of breakie, was forced to sit outside with my son.  (Manager said no kids allowed inside , but the menu stated it was family friendly, hmm)  Wait staff was pleasant and quick...  Food was under par.  If your there for beer and sports I'm sure it will fit the requirements.  Just not for anything else."}
{"text":"SLOW service, crap burgers.  Patty is made with what seems to be some type paste. Disgusting.  NEVER, EVER, EVER again!"}
{"text":"A spider was in my beer glass and the waitress decided, AFTER I paid for it and tipped her, that a \"bug never hurt anyone\". No it may not, but if that's what you tell all your customers, you may not have many left. It's basic customer service and courtesy, refilling someone's 500mL of beer won't \"hurt you\" or shut down your business. Common sense."}
{"text":"Une très mauvaise expérience! Le service etait mauvais et la place est en décomposition! C'est vrais il y a beaucoup de télé, mais le reste est vraiment decevant !   Bref nous n'y retournerons pas !!"}
{"text":"We came here hoping to catch some Sunday night an American football game. I asked the hostess where we could sit outside to enjoy the perfect weather. Pick any seat you would like and I'll bring the menus out, she said. I picked a table immediately and she brought the menus as promised and said we would have a server shortly. Twenty minutes later, not a soul had even come close to coming by our table to see what we wanted so we left. On our way out, my boyfriend explained to the manager what happened. The manager made a lame excuse and said, oh I'm aware of the problem and I'm working on it. Management just changed and I've only been here three days. Look, just save the excuses and fix it, or this place is going down the drain. I wouldn't come here again; I have a hard time believing the word of a manager at this establishment."}
{"text":"Terrible service.   I wish I could give 0 stars.  They wouldn't let us sit down because someone in our party had a Starbucks in her hand.  The person that denied us - her name was Mohit.  That's ridiculous."}
{"text":"USED to be the best place in MTL to watch a sporting event.  This place used to blow places out of the water! BEST prices in Mtl for pub food, and drinks. (Still it) For sure the most affordable pub in MTL.  However. Once they expanded, quality went down big time. Service is slow now.. Mostly young inexperienced students as staff. Their TV's are becoming old and discolored. There are spots in the establishment where the sound doesn't work well or is broken.  It is still one of the best spots in MTL to watch a sporting event, but not number 1 anymore. It used to be a hands down win for this Sports station.  Prices are still great, and the food is good, besides the quality and care being a little less now. (Meaning food isn't served at the same time, sometimes overcooked and things are mixed up or forgotten)  Can't go wrong with ordering their Steak sub, wings, or nachos, Soooo good.  I'll keep going back to watch Habs games, reason for the 3 star is because I remember what it used to be before the expansion. 4 star, maybe even a 5 because there was no place better.."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. It's not really my scene, but in the summer time it's nice to sit outside and enjoy their super cheap 4L pitchers of beer (any size, for that matter) with a small group of friends. They have your typical bar food consisting of wings, ribs, grills, burgers, salads and sandwiches. It's also great for any game/event night, they have TV screens everywhere and it gets crowded fast. But NEVER, I repeat NEVER, use their washrooms... especially at night after a long day's worth of blitzed people using them for ALL sorts of things I need not mention."}
{"text":"I'd suggest the Sports Station if you like sports or just want to have a good time! You'll be surrounded by TVs with every sports event you can think of, a pretty diverse choice of food and drinks and affordable prices.  If you're one of the lucky few groups of 4 to get their at the perfect timing, ask for the table with the tap. Yup, they have a few tables that have a built in beer tap, so that you don't need to wait for your waiter to refill your pitcher. They charge you by the pint but it's much cheaper and much more fun than getting pitchers."}
{"text":"I like the place because of the atmosphere. The price is also reasonable. The food is good. When it comes to the waiters and the service it sucks. The waiter brought me the wrong food and he told me you should take it and after sometime when it remained on the table he took it.  I did not like the behaviour. This is fun: My friend asked the waiter to bring an extra piece of bread and he answered: \"this is not your home kitchen\" Seriously???"}
{"text":"I have to say I really love this place. The atmosphere was great and the food was pretty damn near perfect. However the service absolutely sucked. Our server was Genevieve, a brunette with red ends to her hair. She stopped by to take our order and by the time she came back with our food our waters were empty. She looked right at it and said she'd be back. We didn't see her again until our meals were finished. She came to pick up the plates, and mind you we never received water. Then we see her walking around her section refilling people's waters and she completely passes us up. So we put our wallets on the table and get out our credit cards and await for her to bring the bill. We have no food, empty glasses and she walks by us and looks me directly in the eye and looked at our empty table at least 3 times. Finally we stopped her and asked if we could get the check. How long would we have waited until she would have offered? Maybe she didn't want to be bothered with a new table on a Friday night. We still tipped her well and honestly I'm asking myself why I did. But I have to say, had we had a different server our experience would have been quite amazing."}
{"text":"GROSS. Next morning and my poutine is burning. We went in around 9:30 since almost everything in Montreal closes at 9 ( where are we? The villages in FL ?!) and ordered a hot dog, nachos, and two beers to watch the game. When the food came out, we were disgusted. The nachos were literally tostinos circle chips with canned salsa and some cheap ass rubbery cheese on top. Literally diarrhea city."}
{"text":"Game on! Les soirées de hockey sont incroyable, vous vous croirez au centre Bell (presque), sauf pour le prix de la bière qui est presque donné. L'ambiance est souvent 'loud', mais c'est ce qu'on veut pendant une partie où mènent les Canadiens. Vous ne manquerez rien de la partie avec la cinquantaine d'écran partout autour du bar.  Si vous arrivez tôt les soirs de match demandez une des table libre service ou vous payez votre bière à l'once à la fin de la soirée (compter vos bières, parce que malgré que c'est moins cher qu'un pichet, c'est comme bar open ça part vite!) et ça compense aussi pour le lent service à attendre votre nourriture.  Ils font des bons déjeuners aussi et sur la terasse à l'extérieur c'est bien! La bouffe est bonne aussi, j'suis toujours partant pour des bonnes ailes de poulet! Ça sent toujours le pipi dans les toilettes, mais bon, c'est peut-être un thème pour le vestiaire des joueurs"}
{"text":"wow les nombres de fois que j'ai été et je n'ai jamais écrit un avis, je m'en excuse. J'adore ce méga bar. Que ce soit pour une soirée relax ou bien aller voir un match ou la boxe ou UFC ce bar pourra nous accueillir comme il faut. Les serveuses sont fines. L'alcool n'est pas trop cher. Ils ont des 4 Litres de bière (La bud est pas cher mais n'est pas bonne, mais frappe pareil). On peut réserver aussi lors des évènements. On peut manger pour pas cher aussi.  Bref..bon endroit du coin d'Anjou et fréquenté par les jeunes et moins jeunes."}
{"text":"Pas cher, bonne bouffe, grosse bière...endroit idéal pour les évènements sportifs ou pour passer une soirée tranquile entre amis, POUR PAS CHER!"}
{"text":"Lots of screens playing lots of games. Attentive staff.  Drink prices are ok.  The burger was the worst I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Plenty of tvs and cheap 120 oz pitches of beer for about 15 to 20 bucks. It has usual bar food that you would find at a pub like cheeseburgers, wings , and etc. Drinks are pretty cheap and its a great spot to catch a game. They recently remodeled the place and now have outdoor seating in a terrace in the back. Sort of like the setups you would see in a beer garden and what not. The place seems to get pretty packed for special sporting events , so you may want to avoid it during those times"}
{"text":"i went this morning the food was good, but !!!! the service was terrible!!!!!!!! We waiting for the bill like half hours !!!! The waitress yell at me says she has to serve with the other people and no time for giving my bill."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to watch the Bills football game on our visit to Montreal, so I used Yelp to scout out a sports bar with enough TVs so that they might actually be playing American football. In that sense, La station des sports served its purpose. There were about 40 TVs in the place, so we had no problem snagging one to watch our game. Unfortunately, the clarity of the TV was terrible. From there, the service, food and drink weren't much better.  I ordered two \"double\" cran-vodkas, and I'm pretty sure there was nothing but cranberry juice! The food was typical, mediocre, sports bar food. Nothing great, but not bad: In my opinion, I actually liked the chicken wings. They come dry with three separate sauces to dip them in. My husband didn't like the wings this way and said they were \"too crispy.\" If you like traditional American wings, they definitely aren't for you.  I ordered a Greek salad, which was decent (huge chunks of feta cheese, cucumber and tomato over romaine lettuce). We also got a personal sized pepperoni, which was fine.  I think the service is what made this go from a 3 star review to a 2 star review. Our server seemed to entirely forget about us for long stretches at a time, so that we would have to search the bar to flag him down for another drink or to order more food. Getting the bill when we were ready to leave was also a lengthy process.    If you're traveling and need a place to watch a game, La station des sports is a good bet because they have a lot of TVs (just don't mind the fuzziness!), but don't expect great food, drink, or service."}
{"text":"This is the best place across the street from Hotel Du Fort to get cheap and plentiful breakfast!!!! I have never been to a place that offers orange juice AND coffee for you all in one cheap meal. I ordered a western omelette and it comes with hash browns (they were reeely good. i'm a potato fanatic!!!), toast, a little bit of fruit, and some Boston baked beans. You get a really big plate that I'm sure you can't finish. It was a lot of food for only $4.95. It's practically a way better deal than hitting McDonald's.   I was also watching the Beijing Summer Olympics at this place. There's a TV everywhere to watch sports.  If you're not an omelette person, there's also your choice of eggs done the way you want, french toast, pancakes, crepes, the sports station special (bagel with lox and cream cheese), and egg/pancake/french toast combos. For lunch and dinner they offer your average sports bar type of appetizers, such as potato skins, nachos, chicken wings, and more. If you're into variety with appetizers, you can combine appetizers for a combo price.   For lunch and dinner there's hamburgers, club sandwiches, brochettes, grilled meats and fishes, pasta, subs, pizzas, salads, souvlaki pitas, poutin (you have to try poutine when in Montreal), desserts, and they have a whole load of alcohol to choose from.  The service is friendly and I recommend it to all, Quebecois or not Quebecois. I mainly love the place for their cheap and good breakfast. Travelers: this is a primo destination."}
{"text":"This place comes first to mind if looking for a place to accommodate a large group and/or want to watch a sports game.  Gets pretty  festive in here when sports fans gather to cheer for their team; the perfect atmosphere to be if not at the Bell Centre.   The volume is extremely loud when the place is packed.  The food is decent - your typical burger and fries kind of place.  Affordable prices too.  The low point for this place is the lack of customer service.  Had a young waitress one time that stood there next to me after I paid....Obviously waiting to make sure that I tipped.   Had also come here on a Friday at 2pm and it was quiet.  Since very few clients at that time, there was only 1 waitress that worked the terrace and 1 other one that worked the floor for the whole indoor seating.  I just ordered a simple BLT sandwhich thinking it would take the least  amount of time to prepare.... But it took the waitress 30 mins to come take our order... and an other 30 mins for the food to arrive...and another 20 mins to get the waitress' attention to pay.  Just come here when the Habs are playing to get the most out of this place."}
{"text":"We decided to try out a new sports bar tonight for a change. Unfortunately we chose Station des Sports. I know that these types of places are usually loud, but I never expected that you would have to scream to the people at your own table for them to hear you. And I couldn't even hear the hockey game, which defeats the purpose of why I went!   The waitress had a hard time understanding us, which probably had a little to do with the level of noise at this place. But she also had trouble understanding French and it didn't help when we switched to English either. The food was mediocre, plain and simple. The soup was not what I ordered, the bread was cold and stale, the premium salad was made out of the cheapest lettuce with cold rubbery strips of chicken on the top, and the dessert was stale. I wish there was some redeeming aspect of this meal, unfortunately the rest of the table had a similar experience. Really greasy and soggy wings that tasted like they were frozen several times before they were prepared for this meal.  We got up to leave before the end of the 1st period, we couldn't take it anymore. So we asked for our bill, and then asked again, and then again. After we finally received our bill and paid, unfortunately the waitress tried to shortchange each of our party, so we had to be extra careful. We then promptly left and walked down the street to La Cage Aux Sports. Not my favourite location, but anything would have been better than this experience.  Needless to say we don't intend on returning."}
{"text":"The worst. A sports bar with 100 TVs playing only NFL when there are NHL games on.  Asked countless people and apparently only the manager cna change the channel and he is at another location.   Now they are playing loud music while showing football press interviews and news. I will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Bon, n'étant pas fan de sport, je ne suis pas la clientèle cible. Mais c'est proche du boulot et c'est assez grand et assez rapide pour nous accommoder sur l'heure du dîner. La bouffe est du genre à à quoi on peut s'attendre de ce genre d'endroit, sans être exceptionnelle. Ça dépanne, mais pas de là à faire un détour. À moins d'être fan de sport et de vouloir regarder un match."}
{"text":"We popped into this place several times while we were staying across the road at Hotel Du Fort. The food is good, everything is cheap and beer is served in pitchers up to 5 liters! A great find to keep the cost of casual meals down."}
{"text":"Yeah, I mean, there's good and bad...  The good is that it's a gigantic sports bar with many televisions and a ridiculous amount of outdoor seating.  The bad is basically everything else.  I had a blast watching the last Grey Cup here (mostly because the riders won and because the half time show was ridiculous) but I stopped in recently when a sudden craving for beer and a burger hit while walking down Ste Catherine. (And look, I'm a lady of discerning tastes, but I also love me a good sports bar.)  I have never seen this before... my burger was frozen solid in the middle, and when I told the waitress she replied: \"Oh, do you want it heated up?\"   Umm...yah...   Now, normal protocol in this situation is that you bring a whole new plate and apologize profusely. Instead, she grabbed the remaining half of the burger, set it on a small plate, assuring us that the capable kitchen staff would 'heat it back up,' and proceeded to carry it around the entire restaurant while checking on other customers.  Right...'cause that's something I want to eat now...  So, basically, the food is microwaved. It's not a bad price. But for a few extra bucks, you could probably eat somewhere serving food that has been cooked.  If you want a Budweiser and fries while watching a game, I would say you can't go wrong. But if you want a microbrew and a good burger, it's a major pass."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I have ever received. If I could give zero stars I would. I am a server so I can sympathize in certain cases but this server was awful. Waited an hour for our food while everyone around us got their food. She was very rude and not understanding whatsoever. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Gross. If you want cheap food with zero quality and a side of food poisoning, this restaurant is for you!! Add in the fact that they neglected us with the restaurant nearly empty. I cannot believe that half the first period of the Habs game went by without us even seeing a waiter. It took until the second period to even get a beer. When I politely explained to the staff that the service and food were sub par, I was told to take my business elsewhere. I definitely will."}
{"text":"Terrible last two experiences here. ZERO quality. The chicken wings tasted like shoe leather and the nachos had .10$ worth of cheese. Instead of investing in competent staff and quality food, this restaurant chose to spend its budget on large flat screens and a nitwit manager. The management was rude and guaranteed that I will never return to any of their establishments. Zero respect for their customers and no understanding of customer retention."}
{"text":"I hit this place when I was visting Montreal with my friend. We were trying to find a French restaurant for breafast and do the whole crepe thing. The food is awesome. I had the breakfast skillet; it was just awesome.  I was so full, I could barely walk. The place is wonderful, and in a cool part of town accross from a college. This place had freakin beer tap right on the table. How cool is that? Bar is good, seemed well stocked, people dropping in for a glass on wine at 11:00 am. Pretty cool. Folks nice place, nice service. PS. I did not get a chance to check out their restrooms for shall we say...toilettes. Cant help you there. I judge management on how they keep the restroom."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch because it was conveniently located to our hotel. The food was good - not as flavorful or greasy as I would expect from a large sports bar, so this was unexpected.   Think something like Applebee's. The menu was large and had everything from barbeque to burgers to salads. The drinks menu was just as varied and extensive, with cocktail, wine and beer options.   The server was fairly attentive and checked in a couple of times during our approximately 90 minute stay. This was an easy place to get to so we didn't expect fine dining. It was good and if convenient again, we won't hesitate to drop in for another dining session."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place and I'm honestly embarrassed to say it took 4.5 years for me to find this place!  This place has $18 4L pitchers (of Keith's!!!) and some tables with a tap built right into allowing you to serve yourself beer at a cheap $0.20/ounce (that's $2.40/pint !!!).  I can't really talk about the food at all here, but it's definitely the cheapest place to drink in Montreal that I've found yet...The savings in beer more than make up the cost of the taxi at the end of the night :)"}
{"text":"Nous sommes allé un samedi soir lorsqu'il y avait une partie du Canadiens et un match de l'impact (sur TVA Sport 2) et le restaurent ne pouvais faire jouer les deux parties en même temps car il n'ont pas accès à TVA Sport 2. (vraiment? Un resto-bar sportif?) Le service était extrêmement long. En effet, nous avons commandé en 1 périodes et à la troisième nous avions toujours pas été servis. Le serveur ne ramassait pas la verres vides et la bouffe était correcte, sans plus."}
{"text":"Good for watching the Montreal's Canadian - beer is not expensive especially if you take a 4liter. The service was very good for 14 people moving every time.  But I've recently discovered the one located in old town which has a big terrace very chill for watching your preferred play off game :) The I take off one star because of missing terrace."}
{"text":"Worst service on Saturday night. It used to be better. The waiter and manager were rude."}
{"text":"I went to La Station des Sports bar/restaurant on a Sunday morning during Grand Prix weekend with a friend for breakfast. The location was at Fort and Ste. Catherine. It is a very large bar/restaurant with many TV and video screens broadcasting sporting events. Moreover; it appears that the terrace once located directly on the sidewalk in front of the Ste. Catherine street entrance has been moved to a more suitable backyard.   As we entered we passed the bar on our way to our table and were both hit up for cigarettes by some questionable women at the bar. Working women?? Perhaps. Neither of us smokes and considered it to be a rude welcome to the bar/restaurant.   The breakfast itself consisted of three sausages, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, beans, fruits, toast and coffee. The bread used for the toast was stale and the meal cold. The coffee, horrible! The best thing about this place was the service we received from our waitress who was quick, polite and efficient, most likely a summer student. The meal, however, left much to be desired, it cost approximately eight dollars, tip not included. Thank God the breakfast was on my friend!"}
{"text":"Er, not the best place to go to by any means. Our group was searching for a relatively cheap place to grab a drink after Pride, so we settled on here because it seemed pretty popping. There was a line when we got there, but that was to be expected, and we got seated relatively quickly so that was good.  We order a medium-sized pitcher of Shock Top, and one of my friends and me decided to split a bacon pizza to go along with it. The beer took awhile to arrive, and when it did, it was served in a Budweiser pitcher and tasted more like a really cheap beer (like Budweiser) than actual Shock Top, which was an unpleasant surprise, to say the least. After a few sips, my friends actually couldn't handle it anymore and forced me to chug all that remained since I have the highest alcohol tolerance, and the aftertaste and burn in my stomach was just... Yeah.  I think my tastebuds were so destroyed by that point that literally ANYTHING would have tasted better, and the bacon pizza was a welcome relief. Sure, it might have been your basic, tomato sauce + cheese + pieces of bacon on top of a pizza crust, but at least it tasted decent, even though it was far from the best pizza I've ever had.  Honestly, next time I decide to go out in the late afternoon on a Sunday, I'll pay a few extra dollars to go to La Distillerie or something instead. At least they serve quality drinks that are well worth the price you pay for them."}
{"text":"The service There I experienced there was the worst in my life! We had brunch there and we waited 20 minutes for getting the bill, I complained about that and the waitress answered me with \" you are not the only customer in the restaurant\" I mean...wow. What the heck is that ?????"}
{"text":"Service was pretty poor. Received our appetizer about 45 minutes after ordering. We ended up cancelling our main order as it appeared that the order had not been submitted. At least three tables that arrived after us received their food first. At least one table ordered similar food items.  Good place to watch sporting events but bad for getting food!!"}
{"text":"Good sports bar. Lots of TV screens and reasonably priced beers. The service was good, although it was not very busy the night I was in there."}
{"text":"Le genre de resto-bar sports qui ne cesse de s'accroître (quasiment triplé en 3 ans), qui offre nachos, sandwich, calmars, et salades, et autres munchies passables à prix respectables.   Pour les amateurs de sports, tel que l'indique le nom, c'est bon lieu. Des télés partout, des spéciaux de soirs de matchs, etc.   Pour les amateurs de terrasses pas cher - d'ailleurs la seul raison pour laquelle vous me retrouveriez ici - vous trouverez votre compte. Le seul hic - elle est directement sur la rue Ste. Catherine, donc ni chic, ni cute. Mais sérieux, ne vous attendez pas à quelque chose de spécial..."}
{"text":"What a fucking joke. Thus fucking place is empty and we bring in 17 patrons ...on s'entend that's like 170$ for this empty ass bar ..  And they have the f'ing nerve to tell us to quiet down and put a f'in damper on our super awesome Pub Golf party...they pissed me off so much i felt the need to write this review stat!!   And then the owner or manager or whatever this f*cker is goes and grabs thus native lady by the arm cuz she didnt read the sign properly saying not to leave by the door, he then threatened to call the cops on her. What a f'kin a$$hole.   I hate this bar and i won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is good but customer service is terrible. It's suppose to be a sports bar but the place looks like a cemetery. There's always an excuse for not turning on the volume on TVs. This time the excuse made by the manager (usually rude) was that the satellite doesn't allow them to use volume on some specifics screens. I don't understand why we have to listen music in a sports bar instead of listening the games."}
{"text":"For f***s sakes.   You have one guy drinking tea and me. That's it. Why can't you get me water when I ask? Why do I have to go get the salt and pepper I asked for off of a table while you talk to your friend? Bread stale and hard as a rock. Majority of staff either outwardly don't care (bitching about the place when applicants come in) or straight up can't be bothered (how much to swap fries to salad is written on the computer two steps away yet you can't be bothered to look and answer the question I'm asking you). GUYS ITS REALLY NOT THAT HARD. not two words as my plate is put in front of me and you walk away. This place has perfect breakfast right across the street from school but an unreal percentage of the staff here are shockingly incompetent."}
{"text":"This place is a CAGE AU SPORT copy cat...  Its the same thing, but you don't have the kiddies running around with popcorn making a mess on the floor.  The menu is a typical menu with chicken wings and all...  The waiters are ok, and some are not, they are understaff, and rushed, so they kinda get pissy and rude.   It does get crowded game night, but its typical of any bar."}
{"text":"Very nice place in the gay Village...reasonably priced, good food and lots of giant  flat TV screens to see whichever game is being broadcast. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere and near Metro Berri. I highly recommend this place if you want to have a decent meal and are on a budget."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was terrible! Salad was not fresh , calamari and baked potato were not warm. To their credit, wait staff was pleasant and manager took the food back and removed it from our bill. I think if you are coming to drink and watch a game you may have better luck. Just don't expect quality food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to catch the game, and when I say the game, I mean any game, there are so many TV in this place, there isn't a seat in the house that you can't see multiple TVs, this is the place to go. It's the second best place to see the Habs play after the Bell Centre. But here a pitcher of beer will cost the same as 1 can at the bell centre. And the food is great, I've had subs, pizza, burgers, and wings here, and they are all good, and to top it off, they are dirt cheap. You could go out to this bar with the change you find in the couch and still have enough for a cab ride home, and be completely satisfied.  Another nice touch, there are a few tables throughout the bar that have their own tap of Budweiser, you pay by the ounce, and serve yourself, lots of fun.  Get here early on big sports night, because it fills up fast."}
{"text":"The waiter dropped a big heavy plate full of food on my head....my clothes and my hair are full of salad dressing and all greasy stuff so yeah ...cool place , i would give 0 stars if i had the option"}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out with friends and watch sports, beer is cheap and food it's ok, service is also good but it could get better."}
{"text":"I used to come to this bar before their expansion and enjoyed it. Since the expansion the quality of service has dropped, the prices have increased. I would have to say that the management of this place is horrible. They have a lot of tv's but if there are multiple sporting events going on they will not accommodate everyone. Really bad organization and service takes forever."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go with your friends if you want somewhere to chill and have cheap drinks! Prices are pretty darn cheap, they have a 4 liter pitcher for around $20! Split between a couple of people you're paying almost nothing (which is great for students on a budget, haha). It's nothing special, but just a good, laid-back chill spot for you and your friends. :)"}
{"text":"The terrace was inviting, so we decided to stop for a quick bite and a beer.  The waitress took forever to come and bring menu (which are the table placemats)..we ordered the club sandwich and asked for the fries to be extra crispy.    The sandwich was mediocre, not crispy bread at all.   The fries are thick cut and not crispy at all.   One of our worst meals in Montreal.     Service is terrible."}
{"text":"I assume this place is really good for sports(given the name and the crazy amount of tvs) but food wise it's not that good. To enjoy the food you have to get something pretty simple like a sandwich, but I could imagine La Station des Sports getting crowded later at night ti watch some games and enjoy beer.  But have to say: great, very very big terrace on St. Catherine. It's just worth to chill and enjoy the terrace there."}
{"text":"Costco Food with Non-English speaking waitresses...  Menu is in French, with the American section in broken English (Hamburgers and Hot Dogs)    But there are a ton of TVs with Sports on them...  I would need one of the tables with the beer tap installed to make this a 3..."}
{"text":"Ate here everyday when we finally dragged ourselves out of bed. The food isn't that bad, and the wait staff are all pretty nice. The day before the pride parade we got one waitress who was kicking ass and taking names. She ensured we had everything we needed, continuously checked up on us and had a few good laughs. Her service was so great I didn't even get upset when the kitchen threw a slice of cheese on top of my eggs that I requested to be scrambled with cheese. Eggs weren't hot, as the cheese hadn't melted but at that point the hangover was so severe I didn't care. The day of the pride parade we did get one waiter who has terrible customer service skills. 3 other tables got their food before us and it wasn't even as busy as the previous day, he didn't give us utensils, never filled our waters, didn't apologize for any of his shitty service but that's OK because we were a party of 4 and we left no tip. Other than that, I think it's a chilled go to spot and walking distance from the hotel so that you can people watch."}
{"text":"woooowww! worst fucking place ever !!! this place is so trashy , im so fucking embarrassed that i step foot in there ! the waiters are fucking rats & motherfucking gold digger!  worst fucking costumer service! i rather starve to death than to come back! i am devastated that i am force to give this one star because they dont deserve any!"}
{"text":"La superficie du restaurant a doublé, manque flagrant de personnelles aux tables et à la cuisine. La nourriture est assez moyenne et le prix élevé pour ce type de restaurant. Je ne recommande pas cet endroit."}
{"text":"I used to love La Station when I was first introduced to this place by my man. Oh yeah, he took me here early on in our relationship with absolutely no shame. He was right; the food was good and inexpensive. The service was lacking on the best of days but who truly cares when your bill is below $10 for a huge amount of food.   I was excited to see that they renovated the place and change staff, it became less dodgy. Unfortunately, the quality and the size of the plates have gone down while the menu has gone through 2 price hikes in less than year...disappointing.   To top it all off, on our last visit, the waiter was unable to manage our bills and charged us 1 too many pitcher.   La station won't be the place we go to for a cheap dinner when we are too lazy to cook. :("}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed... Ordered grilled chicken club, it was a little dry.  And French fries were too big, I normally like small fries.     Environment was very nice...we sat outside, perfect place to see people around on St Catherine.   That's why I gave three stars.    If you want to eat this place, it would be better to eat at late night hours."}
{"text":"This place seems to be busy all the time, and it was completely jam packed on a Saturday night with a UFC fight. Drinks are the cheapest I've seen in Montreal, but they are priced differently depending on event. I tried their nachos and poutine and both come in good portions."}
{"text":"I waited over 30 minutes to be served. Crappy service in a bar owned by a cheap , crappy owner . ATM machine doesn't even work ."}
{"text":"I had an odd night here.  Our meeting was unorganized and the restaurant also seemed unable to handle the sudden downpour of rain.  We had a group of 10 supposed to show up and we couldn't get seated for the life of us.  People started showing up and we kept getting moved around.  We were originally supposed to be seated at their outside dining area.  When the sudden downpour of rain hit, we were completely exposed to it and they couldn't get us umbrellas or even move us.  They kept saying that we couldn't leave to go inside because we haven't paid our bill yet but that didn't even bring out our beer.  They immediately canceled our food order which irritated me but since they couldn't get us a table, I guess it was good they did so.  After switching tables around 3 or 4 times, we were eventually told we could go to the karaoke bar down the street that they also owned.  I'm going to guess the odd event of a sudden thunderstorm really threw them off so I understand they had difficulty reacting to it.  I felt bad for our waitress that couldn't get us a table and hopefully didn't catch flak for our group.  We eventually did get our pitcher of beer and it was about $20 but I couldn't tell you the size of it.  I got about two full pints and paid $10 which included tip for it.  I was going to head back there the following night to watch the UFC event but I figured it be a huge mob.  And a packed crowd of drunk meatheads speaking in French is a night I can do without."}
{"text":"I was here the first time ever during St Patricks and due to circumstances spent and entire day here!  However, it was during El Clasico (Real Madrid vs Barcelona for you non football fans) that this place erupted. There were so many die hard fans of each team and with, what seemed like, infinite amount of TV screens the echoes of \"oohs\" \"aahs\" and cheering was deafening!  Apparently they have an awesome terrace during the summer. Gotta check that out soon!"}
{"text":"The only sports bar in the area and its a good place to watch a game. Lots of TVs and decent food. Ordered bacon poutine which was good, could have had more bacon, but it was very cheesy and the gravy was a good compliment. The burger was dry and overcooked, although they never ask for a temperature (I guess well done is the default)."}
{"text":"Best place to be for sports events. Service and the location is amazing. Great staff and the choice of food are huge. Delicious foods and great drinks. Back and front terrace with tv screens everywhere. The decor is beautiful. Good for groups and co-workers."}
{"text":"I would not recoomend this place. At 9 o'clock waitresses are already too drunk to stand and ot is on wednesday! When you order the drink they add lomin/orange/ wtv with unwashed hands its disgusting.  Staff is friendly, but in a back you can hear who is asshole and who is not.  Butterfly shrimps are good, burgers are not tasty at all.  There are better places to go thats for sure!!"}
{"text":"Although the service was decent (the waiter was overwhelmed but well intentioned) the food was lackluster at best. The prices would have matched the quality in any city except in Montreal where the cost of this meal could have bought some quality, more flavorful cuisine. Don't come here expecting to leave satisfied. In the heart of a culinary capital like Montreal there are better options worth your time and wallet."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and every time I'm disappointed. It's funny because I always say I'm never going back but then 3 or 4 months later I give it another chance. It's been horrible ever since they renovated a few years ago. Yesterday I went to see the 49ers play the Panthers at 1pm with my buddy Tom. It took a while to get the game on and it took about 30 minutes to get a beer ordered. Our waitress left at 2:15 and we paid our bill. After that nobody came to see us for 3 hours (I'm not even kidding). At 5:15 a new server came and asked if we needed anything so we asked for the manager. When the manager showed up we explained our story and he said there was nothing he could do. Also, they changed the game on out tv at around 4:15 and there was still almost 8 minutes left. We missed a 75 yard touchdown pass and the 9ers were only 7 points back at that point. The manager could have offered us a free beer and we would have stayed to eat supper and spend more money, but because he's an idiot we went over to La Belle et La Bête and spend our $100 there. It was amazing btw!"}
{"text":"Service horrible. Attante interminable. Bouffe pas mangeable... etc... genre 45 mins pour avoir notre vin + 30 minutes de plus pour notre poutine sur l'heure du diner quand il n'y avais que 3 autres clients. Le serveure allais cruizer la barmaid deriere le bar et ne fesais pas attention a la salle a manger quand on lui fessais signe."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money, skip this place.  Service sucks, the manager herself has a stick up her ass and not a good one. She has an attitude (bad time off the month??). Patrons wait for no reason to be seated, service is slow even with not much clientele to wait on. I guess there are many screens which if you like watching sports might be good. My buddy seems OK with that. One good point, the bartender looks tasty and another waitress is cute. That's all and no I won't come back."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés un mardi soir très tranquille. Le service était très efficace et la serveuse était gentille. L'une de nous a pris le wrap césar du menu à 5$, elle a aimée! Moi j'ai pris pour ma part un club sandwich avec poutine.  La poutine était décevante, le fromage ne faisait pas \"sqwitch sqwitch\", la sauce goûtait bizarre et les frites étaient secs. Le club était correct mais sans plus. Nous avions également pris une entrée de pelure de pomme de terre que nous avons trouvé fade. Expérience générale correct !"}
{"text":"Not a pleasant experience. Waitress dropped my food on the table and left it there for me to pick up rather than replace it. The hamburgers tasted like they had a lot of filler meat and the pizza tasted like microwave pizza. The place was full so we gave it a shot. We later realized it was because the beer is the cheapest around. Avoid this place for a meal."}
{"text":"Le Vendredi, ça se passe à la Station des sports.  Cet endroit, temple de la télé accroché au plafond et références au domaine sportifs est un endroit parfais pour un repas copieux, sans grande gastronomie mais qui, en bon québécois ''fais là job''.  J'aime particulièrement le sous-marin de la station des sport ! Tout est dedans !  Quelques choix de bières bien connues en fût sont aussi disponibles.  La grande particularité est la pompe à la table. Lors du prochain match de votre équipe préférée, vous pourrez installer de la bière en fut directement à votre table. Nul besoin alors d'attendre les serveurs si vous êtes une équipe de joyeux buveurs.  Le service a toujours été excellent! Même si l'endroit est toujours bondés !"}
{"text":"Our first stop in Montreal. After driving for 6 hours from Toronto we were ravenous and on spotting the on-street tables and chairs from a block away we were immediately drawn to the continental ambience like moths to a flame and plopped ourselves down in a sunny spot to have some lunch.  First impressions - this place takes up some serious pavement real estate - they occupy five shop units and the outdoor tables extend along all that area as well as spilling into the first lane of the road. There are big parasols to enhance the continental feeling, and the doors to inside are all open to the street. Inside, it's more like an American diner, and as the name suggests it's clearly geared to sports fans and selling beer of an evening. There are television screens everywhere - they're in every booth, they line the walls, there are even screens in the restrooms. Not really my sort of scene, but if you don't want to be bombarded with televisual porn, you can sit outside in the street or in their equally large outdoor area in the back.  The menu du jour was pretty reasonable and involved trout, so we both ordered that with some fries. The server was friendly and chatty once we decided what language we were going to communicate in (English won), and although the service was a little laid back it was OK, as was the food.  It was a fixed-price menu but we weren't impressed with the poor choice of dessert (rice pudding or carrot cake? Where's the tarte aux pommes or tarte citron?). However, the server offered us a free coffee in lieu of dessert so that worked out OK (although the coffee was pretty bad to be honest).   It's cheap and cheery, and the outdoor street seating is great for watching the world go by while you eat.  We visited a second time for breakfast the next day, and were very impressed with the range of French-style options, including crepes and omelettes...mmmmm."}
{"text":"I'm only giving a 3 because the waiter we had first was a total @$$. He was completely rude - when we wanted to place an order for dinner in addition to our appetizers, he asked \"..another order?\". When our food came, he just slammed the plates down in front of us. He never came back to ask how the meal was, nor did he seem like he cared how everything was going. The saving grace was that the manager ended up giving us another waitress, who was totally cool and at least SEEMED like she cared how we were doing. The manager that night (11/26/2010) was really cool too - he was giving me a hard time about Alabama losing to Auburn - all in good fun. But the true saving grace was having a Budweiser tap right in our table.  As for the food - I wasn't all that happy. The burger was almost like charcoal and the wings were not good at all. So if you go by food, this would be a 2-star review - but again, having a tap at your table is hard to be too upset about.  If you're in town and there is a sporting event you want to watch, I would recommend this place to come DRINK. Just pray you don't get the same snotty waiter we had, and that the food is better - maybe our cook had an off night."}
{"text":"Although we lost an important game, the ambiance at this sports Station is impeccable! If you are a Habs fan, go there for you playoff games! You won't be disappointed!  The food this time is below average, I ordered a submarine, the bread is hard, it's like it's been there for hours.  As for service, my waiter was great and making sure we have everything we need all the time.  3/5 as an overall is fair for tonight."}
{"text":"Premièrement c'est le plus grand sports Bar que j'ai jamais été,ça doit être qool à une game du ch en playoff.Il ya des tables avec bière en fut(faut faire attention)trop de tv pas assez de deco7.5/10"}
{"text":"???????????????$25-30???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Mtl game and ordered the SDS platter. Everything on the platter was oversalted and I only had a bit of everything, half my plate will be thrown out. Ordered a nonalcoholic drink and its as sweet as the maraschino cherries that top it.   I would only recommend this place to watch the games and grab a drink, not for dining."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. When first seeing it, I wasn't too excited about it because it gives the appearance of a sports bar with the set up inside and televisions on the walls, however, they do have outdoor setting with an awning, which was perfect. The menu has various options, and the portions are more than satisfying. The prices are good too, perfect for the student tourist's budget! Service is efficient, but the waitress' attitude could have been nicer (maybe she didn't like Americans, I don't know, but we did leave a generous tip).   Also, I was there on a Sunday afternoon, but on big sporting event nights, this place can get packed/crazy..."}
{"text":"Decent. The food looks good, though the menu is littered with fried food items and various poutines. Our server was quite courteous (though a bit confusing). Screens everywhere, but it's a sports bar and should be expected. It can and does get very loud. The drinks are pretty good. Service can take a while though. We've found that the breakfast/brunch cooks don't know the difference between eggs over easy or 'over medium or hard'. Three times they made over easy eggs when it was ordered over hard. They didn't charge for the whole thing, but it was disappointing. But ppl can totally go there and pull the breakfast trick, and not have to pay; it's pretty obvious that they're not gonna improve that part haha"}
{"text":"We were a big group looking for a place to sit, drink and grab a bite. The service here was great and people were realy nice but I would never come here again.  Ok if you want to watch spirts this is a great place BUT if you want to drink beer (Bud, Keeths, Shock top and Stella are the only Tap beer and Bud is NOT a beer) or to eat somthing (all the things we ordered were average and below) go someplace else."}
{"text":"Get ready to serve yourself. After they renovated it really went downhill. It looks nicer, but lost its quality. Bad service, too big, prices went up. The cocktails are terrible,  like drinking juice.  Stick to the beer and don't order food.  If youre starving the best choice is probably the souvlaki.  Too loud,  rude about making reservations. Makes you wait, have to show up  at least an hour before play-off games, wont let you sit until everyone is there. You can make a reservation and then still wait in the line? I just dont get it.."}
{"text":"Ce qui a commencée notre soirée comme étant un belle découverte a fini par être une des pires expériences que j'ai eu à Montréal. La Station de Sports vient d'ouvrir la plus grande terrasse trottoir que je connaisse en ville. Elle est malade! Ils ont même arrangé des télé dans les fenêtres des édifices qu'ils viennent d'acquérir pour qu'on puisse regarder nos sports favoris (Go L'Impact!) au beau soleil. Par contre, grosse terrasse = beaucoup de beau monde. Ça veut dire que les serveurs et la cuisine vont être occupés en titi! J'y suis allée un mardi soir. On est arrivé à 20h30. Ça pris 5 minutes avant de placer notre commande puis 5 minutes plus tard notre pichet de bière est arrivé. Puis, on a attendu, et attendu, et attendu. L'entrée est arrivée à 21h40, et le repas principal est arrivé à 22h30. C'est beaucoup trop long comme attente. Après avoir mangé notre entrée, vu l'heure qu'il était, j'ai demandé à la serveuse d'annuler mon repas si c'était pour prendre autant que temps parce que je n'avais plus faim rendu à cette heure là. Elle m'a dit que je pouvais soit le prendre pour emporter, ou bien c'est elle qui devait payer ma facture. D'après moi, un serveur ne devrait pas avoir à payer la facture d'un client quand la cuisine n'est pas capable de fournir les repas dans un délai raisonnable. Et un délai de 2 heures pour juste un burger (même pas de frites ou quoi que ça soit d'autre), c'est bien trop long. En plus, l'extérieur du burger était calciné. Mais rendu à ce point-là, je n'avais pas le goût de le dire à la serveuse quand elle est revenue pour nous dire \"J'espère au moins que c'est bon\". Si je pouvais, je donnerai un gros 10 étoiles à notre serveuse pour son service. Elle est revenue nous voir souvent et était honnête dans son inquiétude par rapport à la lenteur du service. Je l'ai adoré. Mais pour ce qui est de la gestion d'une grosse terrasse, puis de faire payer les serveurs pour quelque chose qui est hors de leur contrôle, ça c'est pas fort."}
{"text":"It's first time to visit this place , I find that it has quite & nice atmosphere with some big tv screens to watch some sport games during weekends , friendly staff, excellent service, delicious food, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"60 minutes d'attente pour une salade césar qui a comme seule qualité d'être propre à la consommation humaine. Première et dernière expérience. Gérant et personnel arrogant."}
{"text":"We went to Les 3 Brasseurs for lunch and our amazing waiter recommended this place when I asked for a shit rowdy sports bar with cheap beer. It did NOT disappoint! We were just two but the place wasn't super busy so they let us sit at the table with the tap. The beer is stupid cheap, cheaper than anywhere I've had it in the States, and you can't turn in any direction without facing a TV. The menu is huge and we didn't try the food, but everything was cheap too. We are definitely hitting this up next time we come to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Dropped in late one evening looking for a quick meal, and a drink when everything else was closed.  It's a sports bar, with minimal atmosphere, relying on all the screens to provide that.  The service was quick and bilingual, a relief as my French is limited! Had a steak which was well priced and cooked.  If you are looking for somewhere to catch up on the World Cup I would recommend it."}
