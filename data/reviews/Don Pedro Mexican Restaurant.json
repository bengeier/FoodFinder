{"text":"We are from Atlanta and do Mexican quite frequently. This place is a sure bet...food was EXCELLENT, came in with a party of 6 at 6 pm on a Friday and got seated immediately, and the service was great. Not overly friendly, but very efficient and food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Having adopted a new family member from the Humane Society in Charlotte our available dining choices dwindled dramatically.  Don Pablo has made us feel like family. The outdoor area is great if you have dogs. We would really like to compliment our server, Hector.  Always attentive, his recommendations are always spot on, and he is very efficient.  Hector is also great fun to visit with and it's obvious that he loves people which makes our visits there so enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" place for authentic Mexican food!  The service is always spectacular though I always ask for one waiter: Jesus. My favorite item is the Carne Asada tacos. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight by accident, we were looking for a steakhouse that closed down nearby and discovered Don Pedros. The atmosphere is fun and party like. Service is good. The food is fresh but taste is just acceptable. We had the mixed seafood platter and gaucamole. The salt content of everything is high and the margarita was way way overpriced and not good. This is not going to be my go to place for good Mexican food, only for dining in a fun atmosphere. My go to places for food will be on North Tryon or even On the Border is better. But I think this place did a great job of decorating and creating a good social and relaxed atmosphere. Definitely worth checking out for the atmosphere and service, food just happens to be available as well."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Desert was delicious however I would've like a little bit more personality from the waitresses . Once we were done with our food and paid our waitress was no where to be seen . She also didn't smile much and was very short . We were placed in a booth that wasn't in the best condition as the leather was torn . And it also took a decent amount of time for someone to order the food and she didn't introduce herself or say that she would be our server ."}
{"text":"THIS WAS THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE EVER HAD! If I was able to rate this negative stars I would. The manager and server were RUDE! I went on taco Tuesday and was served filth. When I told the manager about the quality of the food he was uncaring. TTaco Bell serves better quality food than this restaurant. This restaurant will never be receiving anymore of my money."}
{"text":"A Friday night favorite for my husband and I since we moved to Charlotte- we started out going to the Tryon location, but now visit the Pineville location on a regular basis because it's closer to our new home. Both locations offer excellent service and great food at reasonable prices. I think on the whole I give the edge to the Pineville location, as they actually have better rice and a few additional things on the menu that the Tryon location doesn't offer.  If you're looking for some of the more authentic dishes, ask to see the picture menu- it offers several dishes that aren't on the english menu (at least at the Pineville location).  If you're looking for value, you cant go wrong with the combination platters- it's a ton of food for super cheap (especially if you go for lunch). And of course, every meal starts with free chips and salsa (two different kinds, a true salsa and a pico de gallo). They also make all their tortillas fresh, and at the Pineville location you can watch them being made at an open station near the kitchens."}
{"text":"Been here three times and have never been disappointed.  In a world of mediocre wait staff you will not find that here. (We feel like there's a parade in our honor every time we walk through the door!)  The fresh margarita is yummy, and my go-to dish is the Pollo con Crema.  While Don Pedro's might not be the most authentic Mexican fare, it's pretty inexpensive.  You'll eat till you explode and still have plenty left for the takeout box.  And the super friendly staff will point you to some of the more obscure Mexican bakeries, etc. in Charlotte.  And if they recommend them, I'm on it."}
{"text":"Yes, I know ,I am well aware of the fact that if this were politics I would be know as a flip flopper!  What can I say after trying many Mexican joints,  I must say,  I am still a fan of Don Pedro. If it helps to know , this is not the only location I have been to."}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is what sets this place apart. Kevin is the best - take his suggestions!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time, it was crazy busy so a wait was to be expected.  The food was great and the margaritas were large, hard to complain about anything."}
{"text":"The food is good- the portions are huge, even for the lunch combos.  The staff is friendly, and the decor is very cute."}
{"text":"Very Slow service. Took at least 7 minutes for someone to acknowledge us at our table. The food was decent however."}
{"text":"Pros: - authentic, home tasting arroz con pollo. Lacking a little bit of cheese, but still good. So big. Big enough to share between two people.   -fajita quesadilla was FULL of steak, onions, and peppers. Definitely plenty of food!  - 4 tortillas come with a meal.. yummy and generous!!  - sopapillas before you go? What a nice and sweet surprise.   -great and attentive service! Not annoying at all.  CONS: -a bit pricy. Most entrees range about $15-18. A margarita for $9? I was hoping for something closer to 6 or 7, so It was a no go.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for years and finally decided to give it a try for lunch. Wish I hadn't! Food was lousy, my taco was very greasy, the yellow grease dripped from it, I felt sick for two days afterward. They are apparently using poor grade of ground beef, full of fat. The salsa was also very poor, consisted of a thin tomato sauce, jalapeño peppers, and tons of raw onions. Service was fine, price was ok, but there are much better choices for Mexican food around, I will not go back to this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for some good Mexican food and we are new to the area.  We are really glad we stopped in...the food was excellent, service was great too.  I recommend the queso dip, it was amazing.  I tried a bit of everything, taco, tostada and an enchilada and the ground beef was excellent.  We have already been back once and I can assure you this will be a regular place for us."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. The salsa and table side guacamole was very good. My husband and I both had quesadillas fajita style. Very big portions and it was excellent.Our waitress was also excellent. .we were disappointed that it was her last day working there because she had to go take care of her mother. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Killer margaritas.  Food portions huge. Very tasty. Go there hungry. Very reasonable price wise. Waitstaff very attentative.  Nothing bad to say. Will be a regular."}
{"text":"I was  dissapointed....the waiter was so flat...never comes to ckeck how their doing..only once say \"everything good \"  and bring the check. The food wasn't good...I like Carnitas (That's my order)...but this looks like fried pork with any kind of flavor..I supposed it was marinated but this no...hard and dry meat...I don't come back. The only good was the busboy who brings (with a big smile) the chips fresh and hot but again the salsa was runny and less than average....Taquería La Unica on Indian Trail the best !!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today because I love their food.  However, I was really disappointed when the waiter cheated me and my friend out of our money.  I asked for a margarita (while looking at the specials menu which was $5.99).  He asked if I wanted a fresh margarita and I said yes, while looking at the specials menu.  Next, when we ordered our meal I said I want a lunch special $5.99 (substitute the tostada for an enchilada).  And my friend said the same.  We got our check.  He charged me for a regular margarita ($12) and both of us for a more expensive meal (close to $9).  When I complained about the drink he said I told you about the FRESH margarita.  I was like you saw me looking at the specials you should have explained the difference in price.  I did not realize the difference in price for my meal until I got home.  They are thieves.  Do not go here unless you want to be tricked into spending more money than you expect."}
{"text":"OMG! The BEST Mexican food I have ever eaten. The taste and flavors wee unbelievable. The serving size was HUGE and you get free chips and salsa. Margaritas also were huge and delicious. Well worth the money!"}
{"text":"Holy cow! These guys nailed it on the head. I've been here a few times for business lunches and was always impressed with the food. I decided to take my mother and sister here for Mothers Day, man, am I ever glad I did!  We ordered the table side guacamole and the gentleman preparing it was incredibly friendly and jovial. And let me state for the record that I REALLY want one of their mortar and pestles! THEY mean business. Our server (Georgianna) was amazing! She kept out chips and salsas full and even  brought me a big container of their extra hot salsa to go.  I ordered the camarones mexicanos, my sister the pollo con cream and my mother had the chicken fajita's. Everything was cooked to perfection.  And here's what really nudged it into a 5 star rating for me. As every party left they handed a single red rose to all the Mothers. So sweet. Honestly, I can't recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"30 minutes wait time even if there are 4 tables/booths available. There was a live Mexican comedy going on. That might be the reason they want the tables to be empty. First visit and disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was really good!  The waitress was very attentive and everyone was very friendly.  I had a delicious margarita!  The portions are very generous.  I had to take part of the meal home.  I would definitely recommend this place and I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Surprised by the 3.5 star count.  Wife and I have been here a few times and this is our go-to Mexican restaurant.  We usually start with a single avocado guacamole.  I love how someone comes to your table, cuts up the avocado, and adds all the toppings you like to it.  Very personalized!  Wife usually goes for the enchilada and I go for the mixed fajita and both are excellent"}
{"text":"4 stars because the table side guac is the best. Margaritas taste good but are pretty weak. Food is solid and service is fast."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the friendly staff are what earn the two stars. The food is so bland I can't even taste it. I had enchiladas and the sauce was like watered down tomato paste. I wasn't expecting authentic Mexican food, this is North Carolina after all, southerners can't handle the real thing, but even by watered down southern standards this place has no spice at all. It's like Mexican food if you were making it for elderly people and small children."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Great food and great service. I always recommend this restaurant to friends looking for good Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"This just may be the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten, and I've eaten quite a bit of Mexican in my life.  My husband and I visited on a Thursday night. We waited for about 5 minutes in the foyer area before just seating ourselves in the dining room. Maybe we should have picked the bar, since we ended up waiting another 15 minutes before a waiter came to take our drink order. The service did not improve as the night went on; we had to ask several times for drink refills and finally for the check.   My husband had a burrito and I ordered the Carnitas De Res. He was not impressed, but did not dislike his entree. I, on the other hand, could not eat more than a couple bites of mine. The steak had a strange plastic-y flavor. I assume it was just old meat. The cactus salad was also sad and strange tasting. I filled up on the beans and rice and we left the restaurant as quickly as possible.   Salsa's, down the street in Ayrsley, is priced a bit higher. However, the food actually edible. We will definitely be skipping Don Pedro in the future."}
{"text":"Yuck, yuck,yuck won't be back. It's been three years since we're gone here and decided to give it a try again. Service was slow, food was cold bad experience overall. Our food had no flavor, the best thing we ate were my daughter's french fries. Waste of time and money, won't be back."}
{"text":"Really great Mexican food. Some of the best in Charlotte along with Las Margaritas. The prices are great and the service is too. One of the benefits of coming here is the ability to host groups and get them fed in a good amount of time. Splitting a check is never difficult as it can be at some restaurants. The food is pretty good, but the last visit here left me with a very very greasy quesadilla. But, for the price, you can hardly argue with it."}
{"text":"My friend used to work here and he ended up quitting after about  month because of lousy managers, he said they didn't care about costumer service at all and all they wanted was your money. As for my experience there, the food was ok, price was a bit high but you do get a lot of food, not really my \"go to\" place for Mexican food but y'all can decide for yourselves."}
{"text":"I went to the Don Pedro's at 8943 S Tryon St. I am generally not a huge fan of mexican food, but this place is great, the food is awesome! Very reasonabley priced, and the staff is very nice and attentive. I didn't even realize this place was chain."}
{"text":"The food and service are a 5 star all the way!  The only reason I knocked off a star was because they failed to put a price on the house drink and I figured the price for this beverage would probably run between 8-10 like most adult beverages.....wrong! This drink ran me more like $20 dollars  again this is the only item in that whole menu that is not priced and now I know why, because no one would order it if they knew what it cost! :( I know....I know....we should never assume but jeez...I learned that lesson the hard. Again other than that I would most definitely recommend this place to eat. I absolutely love their fajitas texana's and they're fresh guacamole bar is awesome!! The image is of the awesome fresh guacamole they make right at your table!!"}
{"text":"If I could give them a 0 I would!! Aweful customer service!!!!!!  I will never return. Manager was rude and disrespectful."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Mexican food, so I'm pretty much willing to try any Mexican spot that may look appealing. Don Pedro's from the outside may look a little run down and old, but that did not take away from the great customer experience. Sever was very attentive and friendly. I LOVE guacamole, so I was thrilled when I saw the guy come around making fresh guacamole in front of me. All in all, food was average, but the great customer service we experienced was deserving of 4 stars."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte....love this place! Food is Amazing! Tacos are AWESOME :-) ...."}
{"text":"Great salsa for starters, chips were fresh and hot.  Tried to order off the lunch menu for dinner but no dice. Had the macho burrito, which was my first try of cactus.  Was impressed by the presentation and large dollop of fresh guac, a well spread green sauce smothered the filling burrito!  Didn't even miss the rice and beans I hoped would come as a side.  Appreciated the prompt and courteous server!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and fast, but the food was bland and disappointing. My boyfriend got chicken nachos and they were topped with cheddar cheese instead of queso which tasted like the cheap type you make in college with a toaster oven. They also had cheddar cheese smothering the quesadilla until you had to peel the congealed cheese off to see any of the quesadilla. We decided to try their tres leche cake for dessert hoping that the dessert would save the dinner. The cake (which should be very moist from the different milks) was dry and grainy.  We're super easy to please with Mexican restaurants so I'm surprised everything was so off the mark- especially with the restaurant's 4 stars."}
{"text":"Good food, bit pricy,  quantity is little bit more than other places,  hosts and services are friendly.  Might have given 4 stars if they haven't messed up our special very expensive birthday cake until we are ready to leave, even though my wife reminded them several time. Might give another try."}
{"text":"I didn't think you could mess up mexican food.  Well, they can.  This is undoubtedly the worse I have ever had and I'm not a picky eater.  No seasoning on anything,  mushy burito, tough steak and cheddar cheese on the refried beans instead of white cheese. Ug!!!! I basically had to beg for salsa because there was such a small amount in the bowls. I'm a slow eater & the waitress acted like it was a waste of her time to wait on me because I was eating alone.  Too bad this is near my home because I will continue to drive on by."}
{"text":"This was a great find. We walked right in with plenty of seating for a big party. Right away we had chips, salsa and drinks. The waiter was very quick and keep our cups full. The food was delicious. The servings are HUGE. So come hungry or you can share a plate. We would recommend this place to our friends"}
{"text":"We tried this place over the weekend and were pleasantly surprised. I would recommend sharing a plate because the portions are huge. Fresh Guac made at your table and the service was amazing. Their staff is on it. Everyone was happy with their food and the kids were excited they had fresh horchata. My husband and I will have to return without the kids so we can try a margarita. Recently moving from California we are always looking for good Mexican food that reminds us of home and this place is great."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food for a great price. Fresh guacamole that they make in front of you is wonderful. Ordered the steak fajitas and my husband ordered the chicken fajitas. I preferred the steak but both were good. You also get a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"Just an average restaurant with RUDE managers.  I used a groupon here before.  No problems.  Went back a couple of months later and they would not let me use another groupon stating I didn't order enough food.  Are you freaking kidding me...my table was covered in dirty plates.  To make the long story short....you don't offer groupons and then taken it upon yourself to change the rules of the groupon...Idiots!!  I would eat here once a week, they knew me by name, but because I had a groupon everything changed.  So trust me....don't eat at this dump!!"}
{"text":"Besides being Emmy at 8, maybe it is early closing. The food was poor. Ordered tortilla soup and guacamole. Soup took 30 min and guacamole 40. Thought I was ordering quick derive items. Soup was Luke warm and not very good. Guacamole was flavorless . No additional chops offered or given. Manager came by and all he could say was I am sorry.  Put you time and money somewhere else. Then it took a bit to get a check and no other apologies"}
{"text":"Really delicious fresh made guacamole, a guy comes around on a cart and makes it fresh in front of your table. Pretty good Mexican all around. The decor is beautiful, and the service has always been great."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I took my large family here and everything we had was amazing. For $38, we were all full. My waiter was the best I've had in North Carolina. We've eaten everywhere between Raleigh, here, Wilmington and New Bern and this has been the best place for food, atmosphere, and service."}
{"text":"Hands down THE best Mexican food in the Charlotte area....well this and Three Amigos on Central ave. Prices here are reasonable and portions of their fresh, authentic Mexican food are plentiful.  Don Pedro's has always been our go-to Mexican Restaurant in Charlotte for several years because food quality is always consistent."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, although it was really busy so perhaps we were the minority. Tried to customize our order slightly and ended up with the wrong meat and cheese. Mojito tasted like it was out of a bottle. Not bad, per se, but i wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick take-out order and the host went out of his way to make sure we got exactly what we wanted. Good food, good service."}
{"text":"Coming from So.cal. This is the closest to what we are used to.  Food and service is always good. Margarita is always a must have."}
{"text":"Don Pedro's is a good spot.  Probably the best Mexican I've had in this little area so far.  Their lunch specials are really affordable, most are $5.95 and they serve salsa and pico de gallo with their chips.  Yum!  The wait staff is friendly and quick and they wear little Spaniard-esque uniforms.  I had a chicken enchilada and chicken taco combo and was satisfied with the selection.  At the end of the meal they brought out some type of cinnamon/raspberry sauce giant chip with whip cream on top.  Nice little meal ending surprise."}
{"text":"Good start: the 32\" dos x is $5.99. Fajitas $8.99 authentic looks, service and food, Lovin it!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and the atmosphere was very nice. Server was friendly. I ordered the arroz con pollo and it was what I like to call 'flavor free' meaning not seasoned and bland. The portion was huge. The food didn't taste bad it just had no flavor at all. I may come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Couldn't give it no stars!!! Prices are so outrages!!! Fiesta azteca was $25 and the price went up to $60 and the manager said they had changed prices! Never coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I am a Mexican food fanatic, and have tried dozens of Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area. Other places are good, but Don Pedro is FANTASTIC!   I could literally drink salsa, and their salsas are no exception. From their mild, to hot, to their salsa verde...they are all fresh and delicious. Their tortilla chips are a little thicker than others you'd get at a Mexican restaurant, and every time I've been there, they have been served warm. What's not to love?  The one thing I really like about Don Pedro is that you get a ton of food for your money. Portion sizes are huge! This place is super generous, and I love that my dollar goes farther here.  Finally, at the end of your meal you're given warm sopapillas with whipped cream, and some other type of magic drizzled on it. Those things are addictive, and one part of my meal I always look forward to!  I have no complaints about Don Pedro! Stellar food!"}
{"text":"Highly dissapointed. Called ahead of time to ask about Margarita specials. They said the price was $7.65. I thought that was high but decided since I was near, I'd give it a try. The margarita was a decent size but terrible. Tasted like generic sweet & sour over lots of ice. Didn't taste or feel any tequila. Then we decided to try the chicken jalepeno nachos. That's regular nachos but more expensive because they add canned jalepenos. The nachos were so bad. Chewy clumps of shredded cheese over a small amount of  chips, very dry chicken, tomatoes, guac and sour. Oh yeah and I think I saw a smear of beans in there. Anyway, we were so extremely unsatisfied, and regretful. Then comes the bill. The nasty margaritas were $8.25. $30 bill for two ritas and some rauchy nachos. But, on a positive note...the service was decent. They were very friendly and served us all the crap with a smile. Unfortunately Don Pedro, that wasn't enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and awesome.  And the drink cocktails are incredible.  But KEVIN the bartender makes this place a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Food was really tasty and authentic. The service was also excellent from the waitress that we had. Definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants in the area. It was my first visit to a Don Pedro's and I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere took me to Mexico and I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a new Mexican spot."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in university. There are so many in university but this place is consistent. It gets super crowded on Saturday's so be prepared to wait 15 to 20 minutes. They have a lot of people working here so you are constantly receiving great customer service. Also the manager is pretty nice and constantly interacts with the customers. We will always stick with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I happened to stumble into Don P's late on a Sunday night accidentally with my brother when I first came to Charlotte We both ordered the steak burrito dish with peppers, can't remember the name they call it on the menu, and we were thrilled.  What we got was a Massive portion of fresh goodness, which is ridiculous because restaurants are notorious for low quality at the end of the night. But not at Don P's.  On my second visit, we all got treated to the man with the cart. He hooked up a preparation of made-to-order tableside Guac! If you haven't tried it yet, do so, you will not be disappointed.  Overall, Don P's is a fun experience and I've never been disappointed as a repeat customer. Word to the wise - ask them for some of their homemade hot sauce they have in the kitchen...it's damn good.  You simply can't go wrong with any of the combo plates, or the pork chimichanga if you want an interesting change of pace..."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely amazing experience at Don Pedro! My mom and I came in and were seated immediately without any wait, we were served complimentary chips and salsa which were warm and delectable. We settled on sharing the lunch chicken fajitas and we were completely happy with our choice. The chicken was cooked well and super hot which we really appreciated and the rice, beans, and other toppings were fantastic! At the end of our meal, we were served complimentary cinnamon sugar chips with whipped cream and strawberry topping. I would definitely come here again and enjoy the delicious fajitas once again!"}
{"text":"I love Don Pedro's!  The portions are huge and delicious.  I love the guy who comes by the table to make guacamole."}
{"text":"Poor food. Poor prices. I can not recommend this place.  4.25 for a bottle of beer. No beer on tap. Not festive in its atmosphere.  The service is ok. The menu is pricey for below average food. Overall I would rate this place as a Rip off!!!"}
{"text":"I love Don Pedro, the coupon they sent out in the mail was what lured us to try it. I absolutely love this restaurant and it is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in University."}
{"text":"We ordered a pitcher of frozen margarita.  The bartender finishes taking our drink order and before leaving he asks, \"On the rocks or frozen?\"  I confirmed, \"Frozen.\"  Later he brings back a pitcher on the rocks.   So I remind him, we wanted frozen.  He takes the pitcher, pours it in the blender, blends it, and pours what fits back in the pitcher.  Half is left in the blender, meaning half of the alcohol we are paying for is still in the blender not to mention the mixture is now watered down and foamy.  When we asked for the remaining half he said, \"No, the pitcher is full that is what you get.  I asked for the manager and he pointed him out.  As I walked to the manager, he sprinted ahead of me to give his side of the story in Spanish.  When he was finished, the manager turned to me and asked, \"what's the problem?\"  So I informed him that we were leaving as a result, to which he argued, \"But the glass was full?\"  I responded, \"I am not here to debate, I'm simply informing you as a courtesy that we are leaving.\"  As a customer I'm not literally paying for the bartenders mistake.  The fact that the manager had his mind made up after hearing the bartenders side of the story first and was abrasive did not sit well with me.  We will not return."}
{"text":"One thing I really miss about Charlotte is the awesome Mexican restaurants in close proximity to the University area. Don Pedro is among one of my two favorite Mexican places!   It's a fairly new restaurant to the area, I think it opened about two years ago if I'm not mistaken.  It's also kind of tucked away in a corner, so it's not a place you'll easily see from the road.  ...but despite its limited visibility, the guacamole here is some of the best I've ever had! It's about $5-$7 including tip to have someone come to your table and make guac fresh at your table. Now I realize that a lot of places do this, but Don Pedro's has big portions and something about it just tastes better than the other places!  I am pretty boring when it comes to Mexican restaurants...I always order the exact same thing everywhere I go...and it's not because I'm afraid to branch out....I just really love a cheese enchilada, refried beans, and a chalupa on the side.   The quality of the enchilada is how I rate said Mexican restaurants.  Don Pedro gets a 9/10.  I've always had really attentive service here too and a bountiful amount of chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I didn't really want to eat here when I first drove by to be honest .    But , my family decided to go and I went along.....I was greeted extremely well at the entrance and immediately felt comfortable.   Then I ordered a number 22.   I have to say this place is a great place to go if you are starving ! The plate was HUGE!!! I was so stuffed and satisfied.    Also its nice to get well cooked rice and refried beans.    That actually have taste.   I would have liked everything a little spicier , but I'm kind of a spice head.   All together I would say I would go again."}
{"text":"Pretty common, just standard Mexican food. Both the service and the food where pretty average, nothing really stands out. It will do in a pinch.  Read more at: http://eatitcharlotte.com/2016/08/15/don-pedro-mexican-restaurant/"}
{"text":"For traditional Mexican fare with large portions and no frills, this is a fine place. It's a little out of the way down there on Independence, but don't be fooled by the strip club and lingerie store in the same plaza -- for a strip-mall place, Don Pedro is a spacious treasure.  Everything is good here, from the Camarones (Shrimp), Enchiladas, to anything with Pollo (Chicken) and Carne Asada (Steak). Rice and beans are heaping as the sides, and the fresh, hot chips and two kinds of salsa deliver nicely before the meal.  You can eat there as a family, with friends, for an office lunch, or even for a little party, if you're in the margarita mood. I've been to Azteca (which I believe is the same management) and the other Don Pedro (down there on Tryon near 485), but I tend to like this one a bit better.  The service is good, the food is authentic (our resident Mexican gave it a thumbs up) and on top of everything else, you leave smiling without spending too much cash. They even give you a little free dessert!"}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends last week. The guac was good -- lots of flavor... But the thing I can't forget is the Harvey Wallbanger I had. Maybe they use real orange juice or something? No idea, but it was really an experience!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. More than other restaurants we have been to. Love the staff outfits, it is like they take pride in where they work. Will be back"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but it was bland.  The give us a lot of meat on the Fajitas but not taste whatsoever.  The margaritas are always delicious but need it more tequila. The restaurant was ok but I don't think I would pay over price Mexican Food for this quality.  The service was Ok"}
{"text":"Restaurant was ok. I ate a burrito and Daughter a carne salad. The waiter was nice and friendly.  For a quick taco they ok."}
{"text":"This restaurant is no longer called Don Pedro's.  It is now Jallisco's."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  It has become one of my staple \"go-to\" places.  The service is great, they are quick, and the food is great!  I love the Don Pedro Burrito...shrimp and chicken in a burrito, covered with cheese, sour cream, and avacado slices (and it's healthy too! LOL).  And the best part is that everything will feed you for at least 2-3 meals, so you have lunch ready for the next day!  In my book, this is a must if you are a Mexican fan."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Went here on a date with my husband because a friend recommended it. It's spacious, has lots of room for many guests and parties. The decor is nice and reminds me of the authentic Mexican restaurants from my home town. Usually I'm very disappointed in the \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants I've found in North Carolina. The flavor is usually bland and leaves me craving much better food. This place... We ordered one of their large platters and I was SO happy to find that their food tasted amazing! The shrimp, the chicken, the steak, all so good and cooked perfectly. The service was good but the only thing is they forgot a small dish of received beans, they were happy to bring it to me once I brought it to their attention, only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. There was also a cute little boy who would come up to our table and ask us if we wanted any more food, if the service was good, you can tell he wants to serve the family business well :) I recommend this place to everyone! You will definitely enjoy the food and the great customer service!"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week.  It is our go to dinner place.  They staff is very attentive and always gets our order correct, even with all my low carb requests.  We have never been disappointed with anything we have ordered.  Ask for the house hot sauce if you want to spice it up a bit.  They have two kinds.....get them both.  Ask for Carlos.  He is great!"}
{"text":"I go here occasionally when in the area, and always enjoy it when in the mood for a standard big plate of Mexican food, chips/salsa, and table side prepared guacamole.  Food was fine, but we had extremely good service by a very pleasant woman server at lunch last week, as well as all the others who waited on us during the meal."}
{"text":"I can't remember what I had the last time, but it was a special on the lunch menu and it had beef in it (like that helps you out a lot right now). I will have to come back and order it again and then revisit my review. The chips appetizer you get before your meal is way better than other other places down the street. And when I say way better, I mean they don't taste burned. I saw they have a big space towards the back of the restaurant, with big, guilded chairs and a huge mirror. I want to come back and sit in that area!"}
{"text":"If there weren't better options in Charlotte, I would probably rate this place a 3 or 3.5 but there are better.  The food wasn't bad; it just wasn't anything special.  The prices weren't any better than any other place either.  My main complaint was that the cheese used in the enchiladas was a wierd yellow color instead of the white cheese used in most other Mexican restaurants.  The taste was off as well."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it's our \"go to\" Mexican restaurant. The service is the best. The manager is very hands on and always appears to be working with customers.  I recommend the taco deluxe salad or the quesidillas. The servings are more than enough.  You can make two meals out of all the food they give you . The prices are very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fajitas for dinner. The chicken was seasoned to perfection!! My children weren't happy with their meals so I will be back alone or just with hubby!!"}
{"text":"The food was sum what edible and we did receive refills on drinks. The wait for everything else was horrible and they weren't even busy. It took so long to get the check or even get eye contact with a server that we could have easily walked out and skipped paying. They also over charge for the quality of food they provide. My advice is to take a 15 minuet trip to Rock Hill to exit 82 B and eat at El Cancun. They are cheaper and have a higher quality in everything."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch with a few co-workers. The place was pretty packed when we arrived which is always a good sign for a newbie!   While we waited we checked out the menu and lunch specials. The prices for their lunch combos was pretty reasonable! Once we were finally seated we got the chips and salsa. I wasn't a fan of either, the chips were fine (I guess) but just not my personal favorite...and the salsa was way to watery for me!   For lunch I ordered the Ranchera quesadilla. It comes along side rice and beans, with your choice of chicken or ground beef and then gets topped with sour cream, guacamole, tomato and cheese.  My plate arrived to the table hot so that was a huge plus! The portion size was just right! But the chicken could have used a bit more seasoning, I wasn't a fan of the beans (covered in cheese) and the rice was a bit crunchy.   Blah.   So for now this place is just okay! It's certainly not the best Mexican I've ever had but I'm at least willing to try another dish and a margarita and see if they can't win me over!"}

{"text":"Dios Mio man...Dios mio ! --De Jesus  This is my \"go to\" restaurant for authentic mexican food. Between la comida y drinks especial....you cannot go wrong with this place. Best mexican food in town and if you need more spice on your dish...ask for \"chile de arbol\" salsa. Your ass may regret this but your taste buds will not. Seriously...Spice is life and this stuff will jumpstart the weakest of hearts. I recommend ordering  off the authenticate dishes as they truly make it worth while. Mexican restaurants offer so many combos that the authenticity gets lost in the details. Stick with the main dishes or order the tacos.... not ground beef tacos..but the tacos with backbone."}
{"text":"Don Pedro is awesome. It's run/owned by the same people as Azteca (on Woodlawn) so you KNOW it's great food with huge portions. This last trip was no disappointment.   After what was at a minimum the worst hangover of my life kept me indoors and in bed for roughly 18 hours, I was beyond ready for something scrumptious to bring me back to life. I had this grand idea in my head that authentic Mexican would somehow do the trick, and boy did it ever. My wife didn't mind this plan, as Mexican food is her favorite form of sustenance.   My go-to; 2 enchiladas & a taco, extra rice with no beans. I believe this is the #22, and it's something stupid cheap like $10.95. I almost always get two meals out of it. I recommend upgrading (for $.50) to the pulled/shredded beef instead of ground beef. The shredded chicken is also moist and packs a great flavor. Their rice is tasty & never dry.  Don't hestitate to make a stop here on your next jaunt down in the Ayrsley area."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!! Gonna come back for sure. Soo good. Love there food. Saying review too short. Yummy yummy!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Upset after ordering an appetizer and drinks that this establishment felt the need to pull the okay doke . Not once, but twice confirmed lunch entrees were served before 3 on a Sunday only to get a dinner bill. They were combative and tried to say once the bill was printed that there was not edits. That is hogwash...anyway, only fixed one entree and we just paid. We left Ruby a good tip, but sadly will not return. They can ripoff some other family..."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here after work for margaritas and to just catch up. We ordered fried ice cream to share, a pina colada for myself and a strawberry margarita for her (both frozen). The interior is well-decorated. This location is a bit fancier than the E. Independence one. The E. Independence location is more casual, replicating the scenery in Mexico.  DO NOT order the fried ice cream. First of all, the ice cream isn't even fried. It is just blobs of ice cream in a fried bowl, drenched with whipped cream, chocolate and other toppings. Basically, a sundae in a fried bowl.  I tasted my friend's strawberry margarita. It were okay, nothing special. I definitely have had better pina coladas. I guess I had higher expectations for a Mexican restaurant. I do love that they come in giant glasses. Neither of us were able to finish (weak sauce.. I know =P). I do confess that it's probably not because of the percentage of alcohol in the drinks but rather the fact that neither of us have developed tolerance lol  We didn't try the food at this location, but I've tried the E. Independence location. I'm not a huge Mexican food fan and this place did not do much to sway me otherwise. If you want a large portion for $4-$6 entrees, you should come check out their lunch specials. The dishes are filled with beans as a side item and covered in cheese. That's great if this suits your palette, but personally, I think it just results in a very heavy, awful feeling (not so great if you can't nap afterwards and have to go back to work =/). If you love freebies, you'll love this place! You'll get free, bottomless chips/salsa and a sweet treat at the end of your meal (though I'm pretty sure this is typical in most Mexican restaurants)."}
{"text":"Place is great, portion sizes are huge! Me and my girlfriend get the two burritos plate and split it. The fresh guacamole is good too. Service is always fast and friendly, even on a busy night. We come here pretty often!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Don Pedro, so when a co-worker suggested we go there for lunch on Friday, I was excited to try it out.  However, I was not terribly impressed with the food or the service.  For one, they were extremely slow in terms of service.  Then, they messed up 2 orders at our table of 4.    I was not a fan at all of their salsa -  it had way too much onion.   The lunch special I ordered was meh. I doubt I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Great food, spot on service and a pleasant atmosphere made this my new favorite Mexican restaurant. Normally my wife and I order Mexican food by the numbers, but decided to branch out this time. My wife ordered the Arroz con Pollo and fell in love. Large portions served hot and fast. I ordered the pork Chili Verde and wil be ordering it again on our next visit. Skillfully prepared and great presentation made Don Pedro's a hit with us. The only reason there aren't 5 stars on this review is that the lights were a tad bright. Trivial I know, but if the lighting had been just a bit softer, this would have been a perfect 5."}
{"text":"Wow! I can't understand why this restaurant does not have 5 stars! The staff was all friendly and kind. The food was warm, flavorful and perfect. The horchata was the perfect sweetness and they will make guacamole right at your table! We had drinks, salsa and fresh guacamole within 3 minutes of sitting down.   The take away, come and enjoy this food. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Can I do less than zero stars? Food was horrible. Salty. Zero taste. Haven't felt good in four days since I ate there. Stay away"}
{"text":"Loved the service and food. We ordered one of the delicious combos for two, and enjoyed every bit of it."}
{"text":"I know this is a \"chain\" but THIS LOCATION is the best! Their salsa has a kick. I love it. The guacamole which I believe can be it's own food group, when it's made in front of you you can see whether or not the ingredients are fresh. I got the arroz con pollo once. Bring half Puerto Rican I'm used to something else. It wasn't bad. Just different. Too many other vegetables. But the portion - BIG! It can be shared.  Now I always always get the carnitas/carne with corn tortillas. Their pork is never dry. We even get it to take out on occasion when we don't feel like cooking.  Sometimes the margaritas feel like there is no tequila in them. The staff is always friendly. I love the Guacamole guy. The sweetest man!  My boyfriend gets the burrito. He loves it. Haven't tried much else but totally satisfied with what I've had!"}
{"text":"This was my first time a Don Pedro's.  Let me just say if you are hungry they will defiantly take care of you!  The portion size are HUGE! I was not a fan of the salsa but we ordered the cheese dip.  Our food came out just as ordered and we all had plenty to take home for lunch the next day.  Our waitress was very good and even took the time to talk to my daughter as she is taking Spanish in school.  Very good experience and will go back."}
{"text":"Hablas espanol? No importa!!!!  If you want cheap, gringo-esque  Mexican food served by friendly folks, Don Pedros is your place.  First, they serve freshly fried tortilla chips with homemade salsa (lots of cilantro).    They have lunch specials for $4.  And I don't mean Taco Bell-sized portions either.  Everything they serve is hearty.  If you don't mind the calories, get the chicken chimichanga.  Its a fried tortilla, stuffed with chicken, and covered with chesse, guacamole, and sour cream.  They serve enough rice and fried beans on the side to feed about three people.  Every meal is finished by sopapillas-fried tortillas with honey, cinnamon, and a dollop of whip cream.  Muy rico!!!  When I worked nearby, I ordered takeout alteast once a month.  It was usually read in 10 minutes or less.  A typical entree is around $8.  They have a second menu with specialities and authentic Mexican dishes.  The wait staff speak English well, so nothing gets \"lost in translation\" when ordering."}
{"text":"As you know I am celiac and have to eat Gluten Free. I am not as picky as most so I will do nachos from Mexican restaurants. I ordered the fajita nachos here and they were incredible. It's enough for 3 people.  Atmosphere is decent and customer service was very good. Pretty good prices too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. A great bargain for how much food you get. The drinks are pricy, only negative."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in food and service. We will not be back. Margarita \"special\" with sangria tasted like pure juice no tequila."}
{"text":"Ok, if you have been to Mexico and love real Mexican food you will want to be here.  The portions are huge...32 ounce beers? And large round plates full of food. And the food is muy sabroso. The real deal. The pollo poblano is great. The Azteca burrito is very special.  This is an easy recommendation."}
{"text":"The food and service were both amazing.  I got the peach margarita, the fiesta nachos, and some flan for dessert.  The place is awesome inside."}
{"text":"Good food!   Whenever I go for Mexican food I usually get the carnitas. The nachos are amazing! The food was good and they give you large portions. The chips and salsa are great too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab a quick bite before an art class at Cajun canvas. The vegetarian options were few but delicious. I got the enchiladas de Popeye - spinach and cheese enchiladas. They were delicious! Perfect cheese to spinach ratio. The salsa was good but the chips had a greasy taste to them. I guess that was a good thing because I didn't stuff myself with chips first. Overall decent friendly service although when it came to getting the check and paying our server seemed to disappear."}
{"text":"My husband and I are Mexican food connoisseurs and I must say that our dinner was the most tasteless! No flavor in the chicken-my husbands chicken was 'swimming' in what appeared tomato sauce!! Had to ask to get our table wiped off and don't even think about getting a margarita-sweet like sugar and they forgot to add the main ingredient. I have one star bc I couldn't comment otherwise!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars! A co-worker took me to this restaurant and I was glad to find Mexican restaurant that was truly a Mexican restaurant - not a Tex-Mex one disguised as Mexican.   We sat down fairly quickly,as it was a bit early for lunch, and we were given chips and salsa right away. The chips were hot and really good.  We also ordered the cheese dip - which reminded me of the queso from Salsarita's - it was good but I don't know if I'd go out of my way to order it again.  I'm from Southern California, we don't get cheese dip in Mexican restaurants.   Because I'm trying to be a good Catholic girl, I gave up meat for Lent, so my food choices at the moment are a bit limited.  I ordered the Camarones Mexicanos (shrimp -I'm allowed seafood) with corn tortillas.  It came out quickly and hot.  The shrimp size were decent and was served with avocado on a bed of rice, ranchero sauce, cheese, green bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions. It was a nice, filling lunch.  They do have very good service, the servers are very attentive.   I'd go back because, so far, it's the most authentic Mexican cuisine I can find in Charlotte. And by all means, if any other Yelpers have any other suggestions - please let me know :)."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican near Charlotte , been here millions of times only giving a four because I had one really bad experience"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this restaurant with low expectations, as we we're die-hard fans of our local Mexican cuisine; however, he and I both were pleasantly surprised with both the excellent service and delicious food options! I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone either passing through, or for your new local favorite! My husband had the chicken quesadilla, and I chose the chicken fajita. I highly recommend both!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I enjoy eating mexican food.  This is one of my favorite resturant.  My favorite dish here is the chimichanga with the white cheese on the top.  I have tried the hamburger meat, chicken, and shredded beef.  The beef is my favorite one.  It's a must to get the freshly made guacamole.  Margaritas are fabulous too."}
{"text":"I don't always post comments on Yelp, but when I do I highly recommend any of the NY strip plates at Don Pedro's"}
{"text":"Swanky little Mexicana restaurante here in Pineville NC. Wait staff is friendly and attentive. Salsa not so great . Food hot and fast to the table but sadly to say Not really good . I ordered flautas - beef and chicken. The chicken was awful the beef was better for sure. The rice tasted like it was cooked yesterday or older and the beans were just smashed beans - can't really mess that up . I'd say if you're starving this place could feed you but if you can last - I'd say keep driving - I'd rather not recommend it ... It wasn't  very good.  Again the waitstaff was really friendly the food not so much ... So the final question is when the manager asks How was everything is it better to say it was okay knowing I would NEVER come back here or do you say - it was awful - cause it was."}
{"text":"We come here a lot. The staff is always friendly. If you come on Thursdays, they have $5 margaritas and they are huge and really good! The food is mediocre and can use more seasoning. The drinks are amazing! That's really why we come here. Today we got nachos, and they were really bland. I think if the meat was seasoned it probably would have made a big difference.  We also had the pineapple margaritas and they were amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome!!!!  This place is amazing! The inside decor is beautiful with large wooden chairs, oversized tables, and a very unique style that fits the restaurant.  The staff is professionally dressed and extremely welcoming! And the food is delicious! Extremely generous portion sizes. I had the arroz con pollo which is one of their signature dishes and it was very very good. Fish bowl size margaritas!!! A+++++"}
{"text":"The better of the two mexican restaurants during my stay in Charlotte. Plan on a long lunch if you go. They were very busy and we had a tale of 6. So, it took them awhile to serve us all. As I watched I never saw an employee on the floor that was not doing something. Nobody was hiding in a corner ignoring customers.  Food was good and arrived hot. Their table-side guacamole service was a nice touch and the guacamole was tasty. Hot chips. Ordered a combo plate with chili rellano, beef taco and cheese enchilada.  Did not expect the rellano to be stuffed with beef, but it was. I was not impressed with the meat in the relleno and taco. It was seasoned ground beef which reminds me of fast food tacos. Does that ring a \"bell\"? They had an interesting hot sauce. I think it was the juice from canned green chilies and some chopped onions and other seasoning. Was not bad. Everyone else at the table was happy with their selections. They frequent this place and were familiar with the menu.  I will be back if in the area again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Real Mexican food and plenty of tex mex to choose from. The carnitas are excellent by far my favorite. Nice sized queso dip and fresh guacamole made at your table. I actually got my wife to start eating real Mexican instead of the tex mex she use to eat. Wish I was there right now."}
{"text":"Ive been here a dozen plus times and never left unsatisfied or anything less than stuffed.  The one on South Tryon is closer to me, so Ive been only to this location.  The hostess knows us well enough to know our favorite booth,  and the waiters know my spice level (which is pretty high).  Since I eat seafood and vegetarian exclusively, I just pay $1 extra to get the regular lunch combinations replaced with shrimp, not bad at all.  The rice and beans are bland, but upon request they give a spicy sauce that tastes much like habenero sauce to me.  Makes me sweat, but I love it!  Everything is worth trying once or twice or more, and portions are gargantuan.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place has amazing queso aaaaaaand that's about it! My tacos were soggy. It took forever for food to come out. Waitresses were nice when they actually came by. Just not a good experience. First and last time going there."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed. I got the Combo Azteca with no bean more rice.. but when I look on the steak. I saw bean and guacamole smear on the steak. I don't have bean nor guacamole on this plate. It made me assume they re-use the meat from a different plate or something else... Probably won't be coming back to this Don Pedro. Don't get me wrong, I like Don Pedro but not this location...."}
{"text":"I came here from California for a friends birthday.. this was were he wanted to have dinner so they sat 20 of us.   Great staff !!  But I have to say the asada tacos taste like there straight from San Diego!!  It was a welcome taste  AMAZING TACOS!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's wrong with me but I truly just have not found a Mexican restaurant in Charlotte that wows me. Maybe I'm not that big of a fan of it and just never realized that. I mean I thought I really liked it. Don Pedro's did nothing to make me stand up and say wow.  The biggest plus for them was they had decent prices and the ambiance inside reminded me of Cancun.  Our waiter definitely didn't want to be there much less waiting on us at lunch. He kind of had an attitude the whole time, but the manager who checked in on us was very  nice and he was working hard so kudos to him!!  On to the food... we started with some salsa and queso, and the queso was the runniest cheese I have ever eaten. I've made better queso at home and I'm still trying to perfect that recipe into something I love. Honestly every other place I've gotten queso it starts to thicken up over time as cheese does when it gets cooler. Not this stuff, this stuff just would run off your chip like it was water almost. Just wasn't good at all. The salsa was decent standard fare but it lacked any kind of heat.  I ordered the chicken carnitas and to be honest the chicken and the sauce/veggies it was with was pretty good. The best thing I had here honestly and so for that they get 3 stars.  The rice was dry and the beans tasted like they came from a can, but the flour tortillas were warm and not bad even though I highly doubted they were hand made or anything.    Is this a place I will visit again?? Well it will never be my suggestion, nor will I remember this place to revisit however if my co-worker suggested it again then I wouldn't say no.  So it's just okay in my book."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good, but it would be MORE awesome if they delivered.  If you're vegetarian, there are quite a few options for you, so don't feel left out. The portions are large and food is good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great birthday dinner with a large dinner party. Great food, service and atmosphere. Don Pedro's never disappoints. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Super disappointing Mexican restaurant. Not only is the service bad, but the food is the most Americanized Mexican fare I've had outside of Taco Bell. That might be OK if it was at least good, but the result is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Very good food. No need to say more!! Service is excellent and the food again is very good! No negative remarks over here."}
{"text":"I love the people more then the food I think. The food is good and I found a new favorite dish here. Chicken carnitas. While they always give jumbo portions I always want to ask for extra rice and retired beans."}
{"text":"Don Pedro is a stop that does the job. Portions are huge and prices are reasonable. I've tried a few entrees here and and all have been ok. My husband liked his mixed grill entree and I must admit it was pretty dang good. Drinks are good, service is prompt and an on the house dessert at the end didn't hurt. Overall Don Pedro is OK to me. I'll go back for the heck of it and try some other items on the menu.  A lot of ppl like this place, so maybe I'm not ordering from the right side of the menu. It's close to home and convenient, priced well and lots of food - so another shot it is :)"}
{"text":"For one of my final fat-girl meals before gastric bypass surgery (queso is responsible for at least 25 of my extra LBS), we ventured to Don Pedro for a mexican feast.  YUM!  Their queso is well-flavored and a good thickness for dipping the warmed tortilla chips into.  I ate at least 1/2 of the bowl on my own.  My meal order of carne asada was prepared to the requested temperature and was juicy and tender, absolutely delicious.  The beans and rice were standard mexican restaurants beans and rice.  Dessert of xangos (fried cheesecake) was the perfect icing on the food coma that I sent myself into.    Price was as to be expected.  Service was very good and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"The food was great! The service was great! And the restaurant was clean but the women's bathroom was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. I was scared to touch anything and i squatted on the toilet i used my feet to open all the doors and flush the toilet and turn the knob, there was toilet paper and gross things everywhere it smelled awful there was stuff in both toilets i wanted to throw up after walking in there."}
{"text":"Enjoy watching fresh guacamole made in front with mortar and pestle. Guacamole is creamy and goes nicely with the nacho chips.  Been to several Mexican restaurants and so far find that Don Pedro is my favorite. Friendly staff and the food is good too.  My usually is the Steak Fajita with the house Margarita. Heaping portions of food coming to the table. Nice soft flour tortilla. What a meal."}
{"text":"This location had a groupon for 12.00 you received 2 10 vouchers. The first one I used I had no problems with, but today the service was horrible. I placed an order over the phone the food was ready when I arrived. There was 1 guy that I saw helping customers, he greeted me and wanted to help but when i said I called in my order he said someone would help me. There was an employee sitting in the back playing on her cell phone.She looked up and made eye contact but never stopped what she was doing...... The guy was busy working I looked at the lady for 10 minutes before she sent someone over to help me. Keep in mind the lady she sent to help me was waiting other tables. The girl came to the counter and stated a price, no hi how are you nothing just 10.67..... I explain that I have a groupon she took my phone and walked to the back...... So now Im standing at the front and my phone is gone. I wait a couple of minutes but when I see other people coming over and them swipping thru my phone I got upset. So I walked to the back and asked what was the deal, while taking my phone back from some random man . They stated that they are looking for the code. I understand by why did you take my phone. Couldnt you have written it down and come to the front where I was standing and look for the code. The man became upset and told me to go to the front and someone will help me. So I walked back and who comes to help.... The lady who was too busy with her phone to help me in the first place. She then gives me an attitude explaining that it was a dine in groupon. I totally understand that and I explain that the last time I used it, it was to go. She says it wasn't her and she doesn't care.I gave her the .78 cents, I didn't get change and its safe to say I will NEVER go back there. Service is horrible."}
{"text":"Jump right in the margaritas are fine! Its a restaurant with a lot of character. I came on karaoke night which was done completely in Spanish! How awsome is that. From just walking in the door could tell this place wasn't you average Mexican spot. The menu offers what I took to be more traditional Spanish dishes and not just chimis and taco salads.  The service was prompt and adequate to be fair I came late night. I got the milanesa....AMAZING. DEEP FRIED STEAK.  The food put me over the moon and the barkeeps were on it. The food is worth what you pay for. The amount you get on your plate is enough to feed a small family and a horse! Well maybe not the horse too but you won't leave hungry. All and all the restaurant is worth your time believe me you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Having lived and worked in Mexico I am tough to please when it comes to Mexican food.  There are a number of Mexican restaurants around and Don Pedro and Zapata's are both A-OK.  Don Pedro is large with lots of tables and plenty of servers who keep moving and keeping up with your orders.  Drinks are excellent.  Good portions and well-made.  Wife especially likes the coconut margarita and I find that their regular margaritas just fine for me.  Their guacamole is not the pureed stuff you get pre-packaged or in lesser restaurants.  Don Pedro's guac is fresh, chunky, mildly onion, lemon kissed and with some hot sauce or salsa is even better.  Put that in your mouth and eat it!  The menu has the standard USA version of Mexican favorites:  burritos, tacos, tostadas, pork carnitas and meats in mostly tomato sauces.  Portions are great, hence you see a lot of teenager boys and families eating a lot for less.  Service is excellent.  Absolutely accommodating and they are eager to have you like the place, drinks and foods.  Prices very reasonable and they have their own parking area as part of a large shopping center."}
{"text":"Best sit down mexican food I have had. The price is reasonable and the atmosphere is very authentic. They even have a guy with a cart that comes around making you fresh guacamole."}
{"text":"Burrito the size of my head? Yes please! That's exactly what you will get here as the portions are HUGE! I was so excited to find a traditional Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, especially down the street from me. I love me some dirty Mexican food and when I say dirty I don't mean gross. I mean the down home loving traditional Mexican joints where you order a number 1-10! And that's exactly what Don Pedro's is. The food is awesome and I've always had a great experience.   My favorite is the chicken burrito (house special), two taco combo or the chicken fajitas. Yes I've been here a lot ;-) All of them have been awesome. The food is always steaming as it comes to your table and the servers are great- however there have been a few times we've had slow service, but the food made up for it. Hence why I gave this a 4 star review instead of a 5."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here as it's always on the short list of a friend of mine.  While I have found lower prices elsewhere, I certainly wouldn't call this place expensive.    I very much enjoy the fresh salsa and chips, and love their chimis.  You can't go wrong with this place.  And they always bring us a little desert at the end of the meal.  I don't know exactly what it's called, but it's fried tortilla with honey and whipped cream.  Perfect way to round out the meal!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the great staff! Whether it's a party of 4 or 40 the food is always amazing and the service is exceptional. This is MY family's #1 restaurant"}
{"text":"So delicious l... I was seriously craving Mexican food done the right way and this place did not disappoint. Everything was fresh all the way down to the guacamole that was made at the bar while I watched.   The enchiladas were amazing with the rice and refried beans...oh yeah they will be seeing me again soon. This week!!"}
{"text":"Super service from our server Kevin.  Food was really good to.   Would post pics but i ate it all it was so good."}
{"text":"Love this place mans the food always good the staff is always nice and the price for lunch is really good!! Dinner price isn't overly priced either and besides they give u a giant plate of food! Definitely a great for Mexican food!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! It's where extended family congregates when we are lucky enough to be in the same zip code. The portions-including lunch-are really quite sizable. The prices are also perfect, the the servers are the best in the business. Really. The wait staff is that good.  But, the wait staff also dresses in full \"costume\" even for lunch service. Even thought the building is very cool and comfortable, that's just overkill for lunch. C'mon. Get some black t-shirts and let those folks relax!  Also, the decor is SUPERB, but the walkways between tables is CRAZY narrow. This is a great restaurant with a manageable and diverse menu, so maximizing floor space makes perfect sense. But, it's too much. The chairs are great, but take up too much space. Despite the delightful decor, high ceilings and quality service, the center of the main dining room is more reminiscent of a cafeteria.  If you have a party of 4, ask for bar side. The bar area is stunning, and as a *ahem* frequent patron of bars, a nice atmosphere while you are enjoying a margarita (they make a good one) really makes the experience.  Overall, if you are in the UNCC area and have a hankering for quality Mexican food, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Great food and portions. Don't go for the standard taco, enchilada, burrito and you won't be disappointed. Staff is usually friendly but sometimes feel labored to get you something. Probably my favorite Mexican in town."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Mexican food in Charlotte! We were seated rather quickly and it waitress was super nice. I ordered the Fiesta Jalisco. It was UH MAZE INGGGGGG to say the least. The only thing I would say that was negative was that the pipe above our heads was dripping onto our table(bc of the rain?) We notified the head waiter and were seated in the bar. Not a deal breaker!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants... food is always fresh and the service is fast and friendly. Fresh guacamole made tableside and fun spot if celebrating a birthday. Margaritas- Delicioso!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The service is TERRIBLE!! Every time I dine in it takes at least an hour and a half. Yo have numerous waiters , and none of them seem to really know who is waiting on who. Get organized and this place would be 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I just really want Mexican food, and this place does enough to satisfy that craving.  It's a little bit nicer than some of the other local Mexican places but still very casual.  It's a pretty standard setup for a Mexican Restaurant.  You sit down and get the chips and salsa.  I am not a huge fan of the salsa.  I prefer a thicker salsa with more interesting things going on in it, but the salsa here is pretty runny and ordinary.  There are lots of beverages so if you enjoy the mixed concoctions you will probably find something you enjoy.   The food is pretty good.  I most recently got the tacos al carbon which was one of the best things I've ordered here.  It consisted of sliced steak inside of corn tortillas.  It came with the standard refried beans, rice, and lettuce/tomato/guac/sour cream situation.  Lots of food!  The service is okay but not exceptional.  Our waters stayed full and our beers kept coming, so I was satisfied.  You probably will be too if you give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I was taken here on a date and we had gotten here late, but they were happy to serve me and everyone who came in after me, even though it was 10pm on a Thursday. I had the Mexican stir fry and I couldn't had been happier with the quality of my food. It was delicious and one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants I've been to in my life. The wait staff was nice, and they made the guacamole in front of you which was absolutely splendid."}
{"text":"Don Pedros is definitely my go to for authentic Mexican food. The portions are more than enough for 2 meals!  My favorite entrees are the Fajitas Texacanos or the fajitas quesadillas. The fried ice cream is a must try as well!   Service: Always fast and friendly. I have never waited for a table at Don Pedro's, the dining area is pretty big.  Value: There are a lot of options on the menu and the prices are very reasonable. I would suggest sharing a plate or take left overs for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Love this place. There are several locations, but this is the one we visit. You get seated very quickly. The staff is very attentive. I had the Beef Chimichanga and my wife had the Chicken Burrito. Comes with rice and beans. Huge portions and the price is right. I highly recommend the Tres Leches for dessert. We will be making many return trips!"}
{"text":"This is a regular visit for my girlfriend and I. Our biggest trouble is finding a place that gives me enough food cause I eat roughly 4000-5000 calories a day so needless to say when I go out to eat I want ALOT of food.   I don't know how they stay in business because the prices are super cheap and they give you an ENORMOUS plate of food, and unlimited chips that they make themselves. I always get the Cheese Dip and these chips are amazing because they are about as sodium free as i've ever tried (anyone know how to make these tortilla chips from scratch?)  My entree is always Carnitas De Res...i love it so why take a chance on something else? I look forward to this everytime we go....You get tons of beans and rice but that sauce on the beef w/ this dish makes the plate.  Between my girl and I plus the cheese dip appetizer and tea's our meal is still always in the $20's and she will have leftovers. This is the best bang for your buck in Charlotte.  Atmosphere when we go (typically late) is generally very quiet and relaxed except every Saturday night they'll have a live band going.....we prefer the quiet time to relax and talk but if you want some entertainment with your dinner go on a saturday night."}
{"text":"The service is horrible!  I feel rushed every time I eat here.  We have patrons of this restaurant since they were at their previous location, but for some reason they no longer value our business.  They expect us to eat food we didn't order and pay for items we didn't order either.  God forbid you ask them to adjust the bill, the manager comes over and does not help the situation.  Seriously though, I don't think customers should have to pay for the mistakes of the staff.  Overall, the food is good, but not worth the horrible treatment from the staff."}
{"text":"I wish I could have liked this place more when I went, but this just wasn't that great of Mexican food in my opinion.  The plus side was the extremely friendly waiter and good, quick service; the fresh-made guacamole was flavored just right too.  However, when our main dishes came out, it started going downhill.  One of our orders was overcooked the first time around, but they were really good about it and got it sorted out.  I got a combo platter, and the beans and rice didn't offer much in the taste department.  As another reviewer said, it almost tasted like they came straight from a can.  The meal overall seemed like it relied and overdid it with cheese.  Despite this, I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt though, and I would give it another go.  It's got good reviews long-term for a reason, and maybe the dish I ordered just wasn't for me."}
{"text":"Stopped by after shopping to do take out. Saw how extremely nice, clean and authentic inside, I decided to sit down in the bar area to watch boxing. Love Boxing.   My Waiter was very nice, called me \"Senorita\" and just little things aside from not having napkins nor eating utensils, that was quickly resolved.  I could have ordered something more mexican authentic, but for the first time I always order a mixed fajita (chicken, beef and shrimp) to review if I would return.  Well, another post stated it was bits and pieces of scrap meat thrown in; this is correct.  It had NO taste until the middle when it got tastier. The red and green peppers as well as the onions were not overcooked.  That being said, 3 Amigo's had the best mixta fajita over all the Mexican places I've patronized.  Upon leaving, the Mariachi Band was beginning to play, but is was 10:30 and I wasn't drinking.  It would have been nice to hear and watch boxing while eating.  I will return to try another dish as the atmosphere was enlightning.  Hopefully the a new dish will be too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and the staff was great. The food however was very bland. We asked for spicy guacamole and it was not at all. Maybe that trade area doesn't like spice?  The rest of the meal was the same and when I asked for hot sauce they had a mild option but nothing truly spicy. Not planning on going back because the food was disappointing. Again the staff was awesome, just not for my taste."}
{"text":"I love cocktail here. Enthusiastic bartender. Good place to make new friends. I love weekend condition when everyone sing, the good place for family  reunion  o coworkers meeting! Staffs in Mexican uniform look interesting. Even if I come alone, bartender always willing to chat with me when they're not too busy. About karaoke, customers can find song by themselves through internet, that's why I sang in Vietnamese and others customers they even courage me! I had so much fun here. Thanks"}
{"text":"Very average Mexican food.  Stale chips, weak salsa.  I ordered the pork carnita's, which were OK, but not especially great."}
{"text":"We ate at Don Pedro's last night.  I am currently laying on the couch in the fetal position after a full night of food poisoning.  The food was also not very good.  DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"If you need a classic, decent, affordable Tex-Mex spot without any fancy fru-fru additions, Don Pedro's is your place to be. My favorite part about it is the fact that it is huge so I've never had to wait for a table, even with a large group.   I would not call their food gourmet by any stretch of the imagination, but you get what you pay for. They also have Dos Equis Amber on tap and serve it in two different sizes, which is nice. Their margaritas are your classic sugar mix, again, you get what you pay for.  If I want a huge pile of fajitas that aren't going to break the bank, or a table big enough for me and 19 of my closest friends in the Steele Creek area, I go to Don Pedro's."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Don Pedro's. My favorite part is the table side guacamole and delicious margaritas! Instantly put me in a better mood. The food portions are huge. Hubby likes tres amigos and I like to try the different combo options. They come with rice beans and coleslaw. Great place to hang out for girls night!"}
{"text":"I just don't know how any one could write Don Pedro's a bad review. Maybe it's my margarita talking for me but everything is perfect. The table side guacamole was delicious! The gentleman that came out to make it was funny and nice! Our server was super on top of things. I got a enchilada two taco combo, and the Mr got the tres amigos. Food was hot, delicious and served promptly! Love coming to this location!"}
{"text":"The Don Pedros in Pineville is excellent and that's where we used to go every weekend when we lived in Ballantyne!  Unfortunately, this University location is very stingy with the chips and salsa, we could never get any pico de gallo, the chicken in my burritos was dark meat and very tough and lacked any Mexican seasoning, the burritos were spongy and soggy, the Cole slaw was served hot because of the temperature of the plate, the rice had clearly been out for too long because it was hard and overheated so it clumped together, service seems rushed and confused and disappears, there may be 6 Servers that pass your table, but forget service unless your server happens to come back from hiding.  The server also rushed prebusing our table even though we wanted to sit and talk and enjoy our teas.  The server was keen on grabbing our cups!  We had to eat with empty cups for most of the meal.  I kept thinking please don't let me choke! Since this is a chain of locations, you would expect to find consistency from location to location, but for Don Pedros, it's simply not the case.  We will not be returning to the University location.  Also, a small child, a five year old girl I estimate was sat at the bar along with the two ladies that brought her and both ladies were drinking alcoholic beverages but not eating.  I found it very inappropriate and disconcerting that the restaurant allowed this to happen knowing full well the ladies would be driving that child home after drinking enormous cocktails in gigante glasses!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find fault with this place.  Just off of Pineville-Matthews road, it's easy to drive right past it and not know its there.  On my visit, I was actually looking for another Mexican restaurant and just happened upon Don Pedro first.  When I arrived for lunch, I was seated immediately. I ordered the lunch special? Which was the fiesta chimichanga.  The waiters were very attentive and brought out refills of water and salsa quite regularly as I waited for my meal.  The food was very high quality and delicious.  Even the refried beans tasted freshly home made.  The waiter even brought out a slice of fried tortilla with syrup and whipped cream which was a nice touch at meal's end.  I have been looking for a good Mexican food restaurant near where I work in Ballantyne and I believe I have now found it."}
{"text":"Pitiful.  (?) \"Supposedly\" a \"Patron Margarita\" for $15 that tasted like cheap lime mix (I left half) - table side guac drowning in lime juice - floppy flautas - quesadillas made with dried-out chicken topped with cold cheese."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon that had to be used at this location. A little out of our way, but we like Don Pedro. Unfortunately it will probably be our first and last time there. The restaurant was very nice, and the staff very friendly, but the kitchen wasn't on their game. Hubby ordered 2 Burritos - one beef, one chicken - both came out chicken. I ordered the ground beef burrito - also came out chicken. Maybe they were out of beef and thought we wouldn't notice."}
{"text":"We stopped in here late at night, right before closing, and it was still fabulous.  All the food tasted fresh and the service was excellent.  The staff was pleasant and never rushed us (but we did try and hurry).  The chips and salsa could have been a meal in itself.  I had a beef burrito, no cheese, and that combined with the refried beans and rice was divine!.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is gross. I've been a few times with coworkers that love it, and have been disappointed every time. Every meal I've had has obviously been nuked in the microwave, with my most recent experience looking like they had accidentally put the pico on the plate BEFORE sticking it in the microwave, so it came out a steaming pile of tomato-ish sauce. If you do happen to do go this place, get something that has either been grilled or cooked fajita style...that's the only way you will be eating something that you'll know is relatively fresh."}
{"text":"Food was fair, place is ok except the glass on the table is broken and the place could use a good cleaning, especially the cheap the silverware (yuk). More importantly we were both overcharged for both dinners. Waiter questioned and was told there was an upcharge for the combination I ordered. This is not listed on the menu anywhere. Waiter agreed but no change made to bill. No reason for my dates dinner overcharge. Did not want to fight anymore in front of date so I paid. I will vote with my feet and not return. Unreal, left a bad taste in my mouth....customer lost for good."}
{"text":"I have to downgrade ol' Don Pedro because of the ongoing situation with the salsa/pico de coleslaw. I mean maybe it is innovative to introduce cabbage - lots of WILTY cabbage - to your salsa/pico, but it sure ain't good. Cabbage is probably recession-proof, but please go back to the good stuff, guys!"}
{"text":"In order this review to have some weight, let's say I eat Mexican food at Laredo, TX, Nogales AZ, Tucson, AZ, Brownsville, TX, etc. The food is amazing.salsa is very good with flavor and fresh ingredients.the plate is actually a tray. 14\"plate. Ladies, in case you were mislead on size, this is as big as pizza size. The interior is big, decorated and very clean.service A+.portion size is generous and prices are in part par with other Mexican restaurants. Don't read negative reviews place is worth it. Carne asada is fashizl!!"}
{"text":"Love Don Pedro's the food is great, the prices are good (better for lunch) and the place is so nice. Also the service is really good which is what I look for the most."}
{"text":"The food is good, affordable, but the portions are small, authentic Latin food serves a good size of rice, they should increase it. The Service is good."}
{"text":"Surprising place really, located in the same strip mall as the sexy shop, happy ending massage parlor, and strip club (oh, and Fu Lin). I was not expecting this cavernous and brightly decorated El Torito-esque restaurant. Service was friendly and quick, obligatory tortilla and salsa were good, and amount of food was ridiculous.   Popeye quesadilla appetizer was tasty, had a ton of spinach, a glob of sour cream and guacamole on top. Machos burrito was giant and nopales (cactus) was interesting, in a good way. Arroz con pollo was gargantuan. I was literally shocked at how much food was piled on this ginormous plate. Definitely enough to feed four people. Tried a bit of the sauce (minus chickens) and it was pretty tasty.   Good stuff. Great food to price ratio."}
{"text":"Best mexican place in the university area. Service has always been great for me and my friends, and the wait staff has always been helpful. Portions are huge.   My only complaint is the venue itself. On a busy night, it can get quite loud. More importantly, if you're not sitting in a booth, seating is cramped and public, as there are no dividers between any of the tables."}
{"text":"tasty and plenty food . Pork carnitas it is one of items you should try it.  good job."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Don Pedro??  Owned by the same owners as Azteca - this is a good go-to Mexican joint.  They can accommodate big parties or they have nice cozy booths for a smaller get-together.  LOVE Dos Equis - but geez why don't they have it on draft??    The table-side guac is always a must.  It is kinda strange to of tip a guy for making guac at your table when you are also paying for it BUT it is made to order.  He will make positively sure you like it before he rolls his lil cart away.  The chips and two kinds of salsa are usually there before you even see your waitress!  The workers here are very attentive and fast.  So the food?  It is just fine.  I have had the salads and flautas and fajitas.  All YUM.  My favorite part of the meal is the little dessert that comes with the check.   Even more so because the boyfriend hates them - MORE FOR ME!!!  It is usually two thin crispy deep-fried flour wedges with both a sugar sauce and a strawberry sauce.  YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"While visiting the area recently, we were told that this was a great Mexican restaurant to try.  Well we did, but we won't again.  First problem was encountered in the parking lot when we came upon vomit in a parking space near the front door.  Not a good first impression.  The salsa was okay but a bit spicy for our tastes.  The cheese dip that we ordered first was watered down and really tasteless.  One in our party had a small change to her order which didn't happen in the first round, and when it was brought back, it still wasn't right.  The \"small plates\" on the menu came out on plates the size of pizza pans with lots of beans and rice to fill the space.  In some cases this would be a good thing but when you're looking for a small plate, not so much."}
{"text":"My first visit to Don Pedro's was underwhelming at best, but i was in the area today and decided to give it another try. ( I was craving Mexican food and my go-to spot- Three Amigos on Central Ave was too far out of the way)  One thing I've noticed about the typical Mexican restaurants around here- Don P's, Monterey, Zapata's- the local chains- is the service is always rushed.  When I am treating myself to a meal out, I like to relax, have a drink and enjoy some chips and salsa before my food arrives.  I have learned that if I order my meal while ordering my first drink, the microwaved plate of goo usually beats my Margarita to the table.  That said, I put off ordering until I have had my drink, enjoyed some chips and salsa, etc.  This does not stop the waiter- who was very pleasant and friendly- from coming over to my table every 3-4 minutes asking if I am ready to order.  I hate feeling rushed- I rush all day during the week for work, so when i have free time, like to enjoy a less hurried pace.   Anyway, my meal - I ordered off the lunch menu for $6.95- which is  a good value.  I got one taco and a cheese enchilada.  The food, of course came out quickly- fresh out of the microwave.  The ground beef in the taco was of no better taste/quality  than taco bell, and my cheese enchilada was a mushy pile of cheddar cheese.  The food was loaded with salt- and I am a person who like salt and uses it fairly liberally so if it's too salty for me, than well...  The salt overwhelmed the cheese enchilada and re-fried beans.  As for the enchilada, I'm not even sure if it was in a enchilada shell/wrapper- it was so salty and mushy from being microwaved I couldn't tell- no other seasoning, sauce, onions in the enchilada, just the overly salty microwaved cheese.  I will not be back.  Too bad- this place is not too far for me to drive and the space- altho the decor a bit chotzke- is nice, and very clean.  I also like their outdoor patio.  I would return for a margarita and chips on the patio but won't return nor spend money on their microwaved food."}
{"text":"Well- since I got my margarita, guacamole, and dinner minutes apart, I couldn't really enjoy any of it .  Had the pork carnitas and they were fine, but really felt ripped with the timing of this meal.  The funny thing is that I waited for 20 minutes to get my money.  This is the 2nd time I've come here and honestly, I don't think it's worth the money."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. The food tasted amazing. The margaritas where fantastic. The service we received was that of a five star restaurant. I'm in love with the furnature. The table and chairs are so unique."}
{"text":"Last time coming here. The restaurant was pretty empty compared to the times I have come and they took twice as long to serve the food. Once they serve our food. The meat was cold like if it wasn't fresh. Not coming back again. The plate cost $20 and the meat is cold.... yup never again"}
{"text":"I dig this place. Most Mexican restaurants are run down, tired old places that don't exactly exude \"quality\". The atmosphere here is clean and polished. The servings are huge, and the dishes are more savory than your usual combo platters. It's a great place for a group dinner or a casual date."}
{"text":"Huge, huge plates! I couldn't eat it all, then I got a box for leftovers and even the to go box was full. The flavor was great! Good service."}
{"text":"Oh how I love hate this place. Could I possibly give two separate reviews for the food and the drinks? Fine! I guess I'll given overall review.  This place is nothing to write home about from the outside to the inside. The food is mediocre from the free chips and salsa to everything else on the menu. I have only had food that I liked the very first time that I came and unfortunately it was a \"daily special\" menu item never to be seen again.   Oh but on that blessed day how fortunate it was that I had one of their delectable flavored margaritas!!! OMG... they are probably some of the best flavored Margaritas I've ever had in my life. Great Frozen but 10 times better on the rocks!  I live for Thursdays when the flavored margaritas are good drink special of the day. There's nothing like an amazing drink when you have that \" I'm only one day away from the weekend but I need a drink now\" feeling. Their regular Margaritas are also discounted on Wednesdays. Either way you can't lose.  If you come for the drinks you'll have a great time. Just know that the food leaves a lot to be desired but a great drinks make anything taste great!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Always clean, fast service, and ample seating. Not a fan of the taco salad but the burritos and enchiladas I've had have been excellent!"}
{"text":"First the service was AWESOME!! Too bad the food is probably the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten. Rice and beans was very bland and the guacamole was not much better. The fajitas were ok but not much meat. The great service deserves to have better food to serve."}
{"text":"While I wanted to give 5 stars for the salsa and flauntas I got. The lack luster Texas fajitas ruined the meal for my hubby. He described them as veggie overload with bits and pieces of scrap meat thrown in. The meat in my flauntas was very tasty. The cheese enchiladas were good but strange as they had only cheddar cheese and no sauce of any kind. We will likely return and try new entrees. The 3 sauces with the chips were all phenomenal!"}
{"text":"good authentic mexican food - had the taco and enchilada combination and a michelada.  Great chips and salsa (chips are warm and freshly made) The michelada was really unique - the michelada \"sauce\" came in a large 12 ounce glass - usually when I get one you get a couple ounces at the bottom of your beer glass - so that was pretty tasty.  Food was just your standard mexican fare - I would go back, though if looking for Mexican food in the area"}
{"text":"Man, it's a hard job discerning good from bad when it comes to Mexican food.  Good thing I have a place like Don Pedro to help benchmark 'good'.  This place is much like the run of the mill Mexican eatery but the finishes are just a tad bit of an upgrade in relation to most.    The service is great and attentive.  We were there on a Sunday and there were a couple VERY large parties of people being taken care of so they know how to deal with larger groups.    Table side guacamole on tap too is a definite bonus.  He'll make it spicy too!  I like that."}
{"text":"Love it here ... Hector is the best bar tender and I don't always like to eat a lot of cheesy stuff as I eat as clean as I can... Well then I find out if you ask for the other menu (the picture menu) there are oysters and ceviche and numerous other options and they are incredible. I love the table side guacamole, make sure you tip these guys... I will only eat at very few Mexican restaurants in NC and this is one of them ... Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"The food itself was good. The portions weren't the best. I got more rice and beans than the actual dish. A salad was ordered and it was just ordinary. Nothing special about it and the vegetables were just cut up and thrown in to the bowl."}
{"text":"A little nicer than you're average Mexican joint which the price reflects. Good salsa, friendly staff and warm atmosphere. Fishbowl frozen margarita was great and 2 of us could barely finish it. Large portions and there was a crowd even around 3PM."}
{"text":"We went late last night. Service was quick and efficient even with 4 or 5 birthdays going on. Our waiter gave amazing recommendations, he told me to get the carne asada and it was amazing. I think everything was quick delicious and carefree. An easy mexican dinner when the craving hits!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Prompt arrival at lunchtime. Server advised they could make my request a lunch size which was perfectly filling. Extra special treat to top it off!"}
{"text":"Literally just walked out the door. Was at the bar waiting to place a to go order for 10 minutes. Nobody even said hi.  Save your money and go to Pacos Tacos"}
{"text":"Great food!  Love the fresh guacamole made right at your table.  The portions are enormous and so yummy!"}
{"text":"Salsa needs to be thicker...sorry. I didn't ask for water downed tomato juice with a little cilantro and chopped onion, but what did you give me....just that. Seriously this place is legit good. I am bitter about the salsa, but I will live. Decent service(it seems like when you ask they don't acknowledge you they just walk away and you hope they bring you what you want). All and all good stuff. 3 out of 5 ain't so bad."}
{"text":"Average in every way, Don Pedro reminds me of a place my cousins love in Texas. It's as white-America as you can get with still having Hispanic people work at your restaurant.  Cheesy decor? Check!  Big menu with essentially 10 items rearranged? Check!  Waiter that hits on me in front of my mom and sister? Check, and GROSS!  Seriously, this place is OK but do yourself a favor and come on down to Central Ave and East Charlotte - I promise you there are 2873298362879632 places that are better, fresher, more authentic and less likely to sexually harass you."}
{"text":"This was a good time for just stopping off on a late sunday afternoon for a margarita.  The bartender and entire waitstaff was friendly and went out of their way to accommodate me.  Coming from another part of the country I am used to a different style of latino food but considering they made me something specifically for me and I gobbled it all down, I am not complaining.  the guacamole made tableside was delicious and the hot salsa was also delicious.  I can't speak highly enough of the service."}
{"text":"Have seen this place for years and we decided to try it this past week. We walked right in and they gave us a table. We got excited when we seen it was a family restaurant of Azteca, which we love. Services was good and the waiter was very friendly.   But the food was just so so, nothing great nothing bad. All and all not a bad dinner but we will probley try somewhere else when we are in the mood for Mexican."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Taking my boss to lunch I hope he enjoys it too!!  Guacamole is made right at table, and to did for.. Portions are large and it appears that everything is made fresh daily.  I would definitely recommend the margaritas... But not today because I'm with the boss.."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start but I might as well start from the beginning. The salsa and chips were good. However the salsa could have been thicker even though it had excellent flavor. I also ordered a blanco cheese sauce with jalapeños, which was perfect. The main dish was an off menu item, fish taco's with a corn tortilla and a side of special salsa with lime and avocado which to me was hands down the best fish taco I have ever had. It's a must try for anyone who stops by.  Aside from the great food, the server was great as well. Made some good suggestions and made sure we were completely satisfied."}
{"text":"For the people who follow my reviews, I have neglected to recount the experience that really started this entire adventure that my girlfriend and I have made of finding new places to eat.  This was the first place that she took me the first time that I came to visit her in Charlotte, NC.  She claimed that it was better than Guadalajara, a local-to-me Mexican restaurant, mainly because it was authentic (whatever that could mean - she is Spanish, not Mexican!).  I knew from the start that it was going to be interesting, for everyone is dressed up in cultural clothing as you walk in.  When you are seated, they bring you two types of \"salsas,\" one that is what you would expect, and one that I recently heard our server refer to as pico de gallo, although I have always thought of it as some sort of slaw.  Both are incredibly fresh, and if you order the table-side guacamole, you are continuing to take in the fresh flavors that this place has to offer (also the great service, as they will prepare the guacamole to your liking).  Upon my girlfriend's recommendation, we ordered the vegetarian express burrito, a burrito filled with rice, beans, cheese, lettuce, and tomato, and topped with sauce and guacamole (not as fresh as the table-side guacamole but still delicious).  This burrito is large, large enough that two people can easily split it, especially after filling up with guacamole beforehand.  It is fresh and filling, two things that we look for, being vegetarian.  When you are finished, they bring out little sopapilla-type chips, covered in whipped cream and strawberry sauce.  Even if you are full to the brim, you can finish one of these little bites, and it makes for a perfect ending to a perfect meal.  We have definitely come to expect them at the end, knowing exactly how full we will be upon leaving.  One thing I would note is to beware of the large guacamole if you are a party of two for two reasons.  First, there is a potential for it to fill you up and dominate your meal, instead of accentuate it.  Secondly, I noticed after a while that my check was quite high after only ordering one entree, and I figured out that the large guacamole actually costs more than the vegetarian express burrito.  I have given this establishment five stars because, as my girlfriend boldly claimed when we first went there, it is better than Guadalajara.  Everything about this place makes it unique, but it is not unique in any way that makes it seem a little off.  Veronica, a server that we have come to regularly have, knew what we wanted the last time we visited.  We were (stupidly) thinking of trying something new, but in the end, we decided that to us, the vegetarian express burrito was what makes this place so great.  She was happy to know that she remembered our order perfectly, and we were happy to feel so at home."}
{"text":"Great decor almost like Mexico City. Good authentic service and quality food though fairly normal selections. Good for larger groups too."}
{"text":"I must say this probably the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten Admittedly I am picky about my food but this took it to anew level I will say the staff was very friendly even though the server came back to the table 3 times to ask for our order and never refilled my drink My main complaint is the food the flavor was mediocre and  my tamale hag no meat in it sent it back 2nd no meat 3rd  had maybe a teaspoon full in it I just said that's fine and gave up the taste was not good anyway The beans and rice was the only part worth eating and they were dry You would think after sending back you food twice the manager who saw the tamales would have said no charge The photo I have included is the tamales I am telling you this because it looks like a round slice of of cornbread"}
{"text":"The guys that make the guar with the rolling table are no joke. Stuff is good. Portions here are out of control. You get more than your money's worth at this place. Drinks are huge too."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and we both ordered the arroz con pollo and I must see that I was very pleased. Very delicious"}
{"text":"It was a good lunch experience there, nice location, lots of people, and nice waitress who would suggested you to order less because of their big portion. I went there for fortune cookie 2 but changed my mind last minute, probably because of paella. So, they do have paella, but I have to say the scallop and mussel were a bit over salted.....Anything else was good, I liked the idea that they put avocado in paella."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We had the chicken and the steak fajitas and they were delicious! Big portions! Yummy guacamole made fresh at your table...I ordered a regular margarita and was HUGE...it was literally 3 drinks in one! I could not finish it. (The margarita was $10). My only negative was that they didn't list the prices of the alcoholic beverages. It's ambiance was festive and their booths and bar chairs are made from hand carved wood from Mexico. We did not order dessert (too stuffed!) but the menu had 8 choices and they all looked amazing. The server brought us a cinnamon fried tortilla with whipped cream and raspberry sauce and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Don Pedro.  The first visit was disappointing but we assumed we caught them on an off night.  Sadly that was not the case.  This may have been the worst dining experience I have had in the last 10 years.  We went there on a Friday night.  The restaurant was maybe half full.  Service was slow and the food at best was tasteless.  The chips and salsa were terrible.  The chips tasted as if they were made in week-old oil and the salsa had a strange after taste.  We ordered a medium-well steak and a taco salad.  The steak was served nearly raw.  The taco salad was served with a tough and tasteless beef picadello with some shredded lettuce and a few pieces of cheese on top of it. It was sitting in a plateful of some liquid that completely soaked the taco shell the salad was in. Neither of us were able to eat what will be our meals there."}
{"text":"This place is really yummy.  The seating layout and open floor plan makes it a bit loud, but the food makes up for that big time.  Huge portions, you will need to come hungry or take a bunch home to eat later.  For the prices you get a lot.  Margaritas are also great!  I'm usually a little picky about Mexican food, so I can say this places is unique and delicious.  Table side Guacamole is an interesting new twist and the wait staff was so polite and attentive (but not overly so which is nice in my opinion)."}
{"text":"My family comes here every week, every single week. I come about once a month with them and I love it. They are overly patient with my mother's need to be high maintenance and change the contents of every single dish she orders until it's something different they already offer on the menu, and they know as soon as they sit down to put and unsweet tea, a Diet Coke, and extra salsa on the table. They are on first name basis with all the staff and they welcome in my crazy parents warmly.  The food is delicious and the vegetables and meat are always perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Definitely one of my top favorites in Pineville and easy to get to from Fort Mill and south Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was horrific and I am so over his nelly queen.. Waited for ever to get a refill on tea. Another thing is he took my plate away as his hand reaches my plate pulling it away.  Just watch out for screaming queen.  It's just bad and I am a Openly gay man..Thanks"}
{"text":"Massive food portions and massive beers, is there anything better? It's great value for the food, if you can't eat all of it in one sitting you get lunch the next day. The place is lively and fun and the staff is attentive. This is one of my favorite places in the UNCC area."}
{"text":"I got the carne asada dish which I usually get at Mexican restaurants, it was double the price every else I go. The meat was not good, very tough. Service was good though"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place in Charlotte! Always fresh and and not too pricey! If you haven't been, you really need to give it a try!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This food here gets just a little worse every time. Salsa is good. Margaritas are good. Service good. Just stop there and you will leave happy. Because the Food: Bleh. Dry shrimp (how is that even possible?), dry pork, dry chicken, meals are a XXL frisbee platter of 95% garnish and greasy orange cheese. If I spend $50+ on dinner I want to leave with more than just a stomach full of chips and a new salsa stain on my sleeve."}
{"text":"My husband loves sitting on the patio. I love that the chips come with not only tomato salsa, but also chopped Pico de Gallo. This is an old standby for us, as it's close by and they have a good health score. At times they have people going around with carts, making items at your table. I love it when they have the fresh guacamole: they know how to spice it perfectly and you can get it with additional fresh garlic or hot peppers if you like. It's served in the volcanic pestle bowl they make it in. The other cart they have sometimes is fresh citrus margaritas, where they squeeze the limes at your table. Portions here are huge, so we always have enough to take home. I love the fajita salad. My husband usually has the Texcana Fajitas, which has a mixture of beef, chicken and shrimp with onions and peppers. It comes with tortillas, refried beans, yellow rice, sour cream and guacamole. The other meal I really enjoy is the Steak Rey, which has a glorious cactus salad as part of the plate. (I wish some of these places would have black beans instead of the refried.) I usually come for supper when I have plenty of time to socialize, so I can enjoy taking my time then. If I am going to pay for a meal, I want to allow myself time to savor each bite. This probably isn't a good place if you need to eat and run. And if you really want to embarrass someone, bring them here for their birthday. They will put a huge sombrero on their head and sing to them with a guitar :)"}
{"text":"This is usually our go to spot for chips and guacamole and a good margarita. We're from California and Arizona and we're never impressed by the Mexican food in Charlotte but the margaritas here were good enough to keep us coming back.  However, tonight will be the last time we ever return here. The service we experienced tonight was absolutely awful. I know it's cinco de mayo and we expected to run into a bit of a crowd here so we headed out for an early diner. Mid way through our meal they start blasting an Eminem song so loud that you could barely here the person sitting next to you. My three year old was immediately startled and I did my best to console her. The music only seemed to get louder and louder with each song. I asked the hostess what was going on and why the music was so loud and she said \"well it's cinco de mayo.\" I sat back down and tried to finish the rest of my meal. As the music continued to get louder my daughter began to cry because she was so scared by the sheer loudness of it. I had to leave my meal half unfinished and her meal untouched, My husband and two older daughters stayed in the restaurant to finish up.  When the manager came by to speak with my husband he got the same response that I did \"Well it's cinco de mayo, so we have a DJ.\"  I get that it's cinco de mayo. I get that people are out to have a good time. But this a restaurant where many families were eating it. NOT A CLUB. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A DANCE FLOOR. It was the most awful experience ever, only to be made worse by their poor customer service If I could give them zero stars I would. We will definitely never return here again."}
{"text":"While this place is in a shopping center, it's a whole lot bigger than you'd expect, & the food is pretty good as well. While I do have the perception that Mexican food is really tough to screw up, Don Pedro's is above average in the taste department. I think the only negative is the price, when you can get just as good Mexican at some lesser known places for cheaper.  There's plenty of seating, so the lunch crowd usually moves through pretty quickly. The seating area is also pretty wide open so you can take quite a bit of people along with you. They also have a separate bar area as well as outdoor patio seating.   They serve the typical mexican dishes & everything is pretty tasty but won't blow you away. They have free chips & salsa which is always a plus & two types of salsa as well. I like their pico salsa better than their runny stuff, but both are fine considering their price.   Don Pedro's is good if you're with a large lunch group during work, the food will satisfy you, and you'll get in & out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Had the yummiest lunch with the Universes most beautiful Wife, Tiffany Louise, today at Don Pedro's Mexican Restaurant - felt bad as I could only squeeze in 3/4's of this awesome meal. Service staff were so friendly and courteous. The food was excellently prepared, lots of fresh produce and perfectly cooked steak and shrimp. Time for a siesta LOL - Nicky Litherland"}
{"text":"Food: below average Server: nothing to say. They should hire people who can serve non Hispanic customers"}
{"text":"Such a great place. Food was fantastic. Tres Amigos with a cold Modelo . Wonderful. U will be coming back here in future business trips and will tell all my co-workers about this place ."}
{"text":"The restaurant is absolutely stunning on the inside. Relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff. The food was amazing, the salsa that came with the chips was not spicy at all for those of us can't handle spice.   I got the Polla Con Crema. (Pic below)"}
{"text":"When it comes to Don Pedro, I definitely enjoy my time. The staff was friendly, the food was delicious and the layout of the place was very relax and chill. This place is definitely a great to come and get a nice meal at a good price. I originally came because me and a coworker were watching a soccer game before heading to work and from the moment I arrived they were always helpful and simply ready for all of our orders. I had the queso dip which was perfect in every aspect. The texture, taste and thickness were simply all on point. Plus, I ordered two mai thais and although strong in alcohol, it was still good. Anyway, I had some fish tacos and let me tell you, although the tacos were small, everything else will get you full. A lot of fish bits, a lot of rice and lots of black beans, I have to say you will end up taking some home. I will have to recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Mexican Food in the University area and you have to stop by so you can get your grub on."}
{"text":"Don Pedro is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. My family and I have been there several times and we are rarely disappointed. The chips, salsa and pico de gallo are good. I love getting the fresh guacamole that they prepare at the table in front of you. We went there on a Sunday night once and they were out of avocados. I was devastated, to say the least.  My favorite meal is the chicken chalupa and chicken enchilada combination. Their combinations are the way to go in my opinion. My sister always gets the steak and chicken fajitas. The margaritas are good too and are always on point.  I took off one star because the service can be hit or miss. One time we had several different servers check on us and we asked each of them for another silverware and napkin set because my dad didn't get one. Each of them said yes but never came back. My dad finally had to ask the manager when he came with the food and then he finally got it.   Another time we went and had the opposite issue - the waitress literally checked on us every MINUTE. I wish I was exaggerating.  We could barely have a conversation without her showing up and asking us if we needed something. It was beyond irritating and we all left seriously annoyed! Another time my parents went without me and they served my dad a beer in a HOT mug. He complained and they immediately brought a new one, but seriously? HOT BEER? LOL  So all in all - great food, but needs to work on service issues."}
{"text":"Wow do they have a large selection of delicious authentic Mexican dishes. Our waiter was great and very attentive. Will definitely stop by again when back in town. Thank you Don Pedro's"}
{"text":"Not sure what's changed here, but the last three times I've visited the service was simply nonexistent.  We waited to be seated, waited for drinks, never got any refills...  just bad.  This sucks too because it was my local mexican lunch spot  :-("}
{"text":"No, thanks. We were visiting Charlotte to move my son to college. I love Mexican, Tex-Mex, Faux Mexican but this was not it! The best part of my meal was at the end. They gave us fried tortilla triangles with whip cream, cinnamon, and syrup. Though reasonably priced, the food was bland, and they wouldn't accomdate any changes. My 8-month pregnant daughter wanted white queso instead of crema. That was a no. Though it is a meal offered at other locations. Maybe they aren't affliated? The worse part was when they were on a ladder beside our table screwing in speakers with the AC repairman cleaning the vents and dropping the debris. Really, right now?"}
{"text":"For NC the food was good. Try the carnitas de res. Visiting from cali. Also the carnitas de res was great"}
{"text":"2.5 stars - Cheap and insanely huge....For $7-8 you can have enough food to tip the scale over a few notches...I recommend sharing   I tend to go for the #33 lunch special with a tostada and cheese enchilada. I preferred La Paz's enchiladas but now they are gone....so these will do. The food is sort of one note- cheesy.. Speaking of cheesy their queso is some of the better I've had (I am not an imitation cheese fan). The guac is just ok - wish they spiced it up a bit more and added more lime.   A co-worker of mine ordered the veggie quesadilla - and honestly it was beyond even what a large plate is and was filled with huge chunks of once frozen veggies - cauliflower, broccoli, green peppers, onions. She said the veggies must have been cooked in a thicker oil (not something like olive oil) - and the flavor was odd. So  if you don't eat meat I think a better option (taste and sadly even calorie-wise) is the cheese enchilada.   This wouldn't be a place I would go out of my way to go to, but I go as a group work lunch and haven't been  disappointed - not the best,  not the worst....just plain ok..."}
{"text":"Easy to find and plenty of parking since it's in a strip mall. Inside, there's plenty of seating, service was quick and courteous, but it went downhill from there. (Cover the eyes of small children. This ain't pretty.)  The first bowl of chips were a bit stale. The second bowl was warm, so they're forgiven, but the salsa is too watery for my preferences. The servers are dressed up in traditional Mexican clothing. This along with the ornately carved chairs, tables, and the decor sufficiently welcome the \"adventurous white people\" to \"Mexico\", but the giant painting is a bit over the top, in my opinion. I think this is the source of the inflated rating. People who don't normally have Hispanic fare thinking this was great as a first experience. I might be white and adventurous, but I grew up on authentic Hispanic and Asian food, or at least as close as you can get in Atlanta. MOVING ON.  I ordered the steak Azteca, which comes with rice, beans, vegetables, tortillas, and butterflied shrimp, or \"Mexican prawn\", that are still attached to the shell, making consumption a chore. Quite depressingly, the steak was overcooked and bland. I asked for medium, and it was almost well. That I can deal with, but the lack of spices was an insult to my taste buds. The rice was unbalanced. One bite was juicy and perfect, the next was mediocre, and there was plenty of undercooked/overcooked rice. Didn't touch the ensemble of mushrooms, onions, and peppers. Didn't look appealing at all. The tortillas were average. The refried beans were the best thing on the plate. Too bad I don't really like refried beans. Didn't finish anything on the plate except the shrimp.  And the review was still somewhat respectable, but the flan did it. Plated horribly. Not sure if they were out of the smaller dishes or what, but it came out on an entrée dish. Plenty of caramel and cream, but the flan mixture is off. Not creamy enough at all. Needs more milk, me thinks.  1 star, but they earned it. Not coming back. I've had better in small Midwestern towns with 3 digit populations. Pathetic for a large town like Charlotte. Only thing authentic was the waitress. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The service wasn't good, we had to track her down to order, she checked some while we ate then had to track her down for our check. My avocado tostada had 3 small pieces of avocado, I was expecting more. My husband had the deluxe burrito, he said it was pretty good but something he could've easily just made at home. The worst part was the queso!! It tasted EXACTLY like store bought from a can with the little jalapeños in it. SO disappointing! Mexican restaurants usually have the best cheese dip, not this place!!! We won't be back"}
{"text":"Don Pedro is a good choice in the Charlotte Mexican food scene. They have a stacked menu with lots of different options. Like most Mexican restaurants, they'll start you out with complimentary chips and salsa. That can be dangerous, but oh so delicious at the same time.  Most of the staff is helpful and friendly. Ask for Kevin! He goes above and beyond to make your visit exceptional!  I was disappointed with my last visit and the Mexican stir fry I ordered, it definitely wasn't as good as the first time I picked - several months earlier. It's ok. Things happen, and I have had several other great things from Don and his staff. That won't deter me from returning.  Saturday nights can get a little loud with a live mariachi band making the rounds as well as other music they may be playing to salute folks celebrating a cumpleaños. (That's Spanish for birthday! C'mon people.. look it up!)  When you are finished eating and ready to settle your tab, they will top off your tummy with complimentary sweet dessert tortilla chips! Yum!"}
{"text":"It's not often that I'm this far on this side of town, but one night we were and we decided to stop in to Don Pedro since we have been to the one on Independence a number of times.  I'd have to assume that they are run by the same folks, based on the menu and selections offered, even though they don't look anything like each other.  While the Independence location is in a massive - even cavernous - building, this one probably offers the same amount of seating, but it's in a more traditional arrangement and you just don't notice it because the booths are in separate rooms rather than one big one.  The portions are good-sized, and as Nick mentions, you get free chips and salsa (a common thread among American-Mexican restaurants in Charlotte), and the taste of the food you'll get is fairly similar as well.  Service at both this location and the Independence location is friendly and quick, and the food is served quickly to boot.  While it isn't anything fancy, it's definitely a place that will come in useful if you have a craving for Mexican that needs to be satisfied."}
{"text":"Another restaurant in a strip mall, but this one is different too.  Rather than being tucked in a small space, this one is quite cavernous.  While the entrance seems small, you are led through a door into what is almost a warehouse that has been converted into a Mexican cantina, and you are greeted quickly and rapidly served toasty warm chips.  The meal is then served quickly, with fresh ingredients and large portions.  While the only downfall is that the rest of the strip mall around the restaurant isn't doing that well, the fact that this is part of a larger regional chain may allow it to ride out the storm.  I sure hope so."}
{"text":"Service is good. Salsa is good but not that spicy. I love that it had lots of onions and cilantro in it! I got the two tacos and rice. Beef was a little greasy. Huge portion of rice. Plates are huge. Large portions. Husband got a combo with a taco, enchilada and chile Reno. He wasn't a fan of the chile Reno. He said it was a odd texture. Other than that, I could go again!"}
{"text":"Good - table made guacamole was very delicious and so was the cheese dip and chips. The bad - I ordered the enchilada/ taco beef combo.  The beef tasted like it was either out of a can or cooked in a giant vat for hours.  No red sauce on the enchilada, isn't that a standard?  Sean ordered a 1/2 chicken & 1/2 beef chimi and was equally disappointed.  It wasn't anything great and he thought the same about the beef. The atmosphere was nice, Spanish tile throughout and the server was good and very accommodating to our special orders. Would only go back if I can't find another place with just as delicious fresh guac."}
{"text":"One of my families favorite restaurants. I get the Dos Compadre dish most of the time we go (chicken and steak). You have to ask for the picture menu, I don't think it's on the regular one. I have had other dishes that were very good also. I think they still have the Thursday margarita special (6.00) for several different flavors. My favorite is the Mango!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on a whim. The beans and rice were good. Ground beef was greasier than anticipated. (And it was anticipated to be greeasssy). Might go again if I feel like eating unhealthy. Tasted pretty good over all."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I could eat here once a week an never get bored with the food .  I love their Taco salad you can add rice and beans to it so good nice crispy shell . Tonight I ordered the Avocado Tostada , with refried beans and rice huge plate of food. The fresh cut avocado is perfect with the Chicken , beans an Rice. My favorite end to the meal the rasberry tortilla you get with check yum . They have a few locations Pineville an one off South Tryon , great wait staff . Stop in for their lunch specials an great to stop an get a taco salad an you get a bag of chips with it great salsa ."}
{"text":"First time here and I truly enjoyed it. The service was great and so was the food. We went on a Saturday and we were served pretty quickly. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"The decor was very inviting and the menu had many options. The staff was more than ready to help with any questions or concerns. The food was very good. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I came here with some colleagues on a business trip. The decorations were impressive. The food was decent and the price was okay. I'm not wholly impressed with anything else in particular though."}
{"text":"There are so many highlights of my visit, I don't even know where to start. The fresh guacamole is like no other. I was very impressed that they actually make it  at your table. The seafood quesadilla was seasoned very well and the margarita was excellent!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst Mexican i have ever had. The refried beans were bland and the rice had no flavor. I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"great place for mexican! went here with a group of friends and we all had a great time. great service, great food!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't awful but I can say it was the worst Mexican food I have ever had. I got the shrimp fajitas and it was obvious that there was no seasoning whatsoever on my shrimp. That being said it was $7 so ehhhhh."}
{"text":"Great service and Margaritas very good order Campechana and got Shrimp and octopus only NOT Campechana"}
{"text":"The guacamole is amazing here, however the food needs some work. It's just too inconsistent for me and it drives me off the walls because i want to like this place. Not for nothing, its a cheap meal but dont expect anything spectacular here. Certain dishes they do well and other dishes im like lawdddd mercy what just happened here haha."}
{"text":"I've read a few reviews that show Don Pedro as subpar, did they eat at the same place as I did? Myself and the better half have eaten here several times, and each time we leave with our palates thanking us for the visit. Miguel will make tableside, incredible guacamole to your taste. As you will see in numerous reviews, ask for the \"Picture Menu\" you won't be disappointed. From the Taco Salads, to the Chimichangas, to the fresh made Guacamole.....visit Don Pedro with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Don Pedro's  The last time I went there my service was excellent and the food was great.  Here they have two different kinds of salsa for the chips.  One is a normal salsa and the other is kind of like a Salsa-slaw.  There is a boy that comes around and offers to make fresh guacamole.  We never get that because my fiancée normally goes for the Queso dip.    They have Victoria Beer there but it is not on the menu.    I asked for an Arbol Chili sauce and they had some!  I was pretty impressed by that and that's why I am giving 5 stars.  The Arbol Chili sauce is hot so if you want to impress your friends you should get it!"}
{"text":"American Mexican food.  Clearly not what they eat on the streets of Nogales or Mexico City, but satisfying all the same.  Catch the guy working the guacamole cart.  Best bang for the buck in town.  Can't even buy avocados in store for price.  It's a bit of kitsch, yet a nice touch.  Ask for the \"picture menu,\" which is family, share style.  Again, good price point and somewhat more adventurous than the standard ground beef taco, beans and rice.  Dos Compadres enough for a smaller family.  Grilled need, chicken, green onion, etc.  Family operated.  Don't assume server is Mexican, as you have a better than even chance speaking with an Ecuadorian or someone from another Central American country.  Nice people.  Good food and cheap price."}
{"text":"No small portions at this place! The beans and rice took up 75% of the space on the plate. ( I ordered chicken tacos.) Everything satisfied me. The juice from the meat spilled onto my top but no worries. ( That just demonstrates how marinated the meat was!) It doesn't exceed the Mexican food in California but it'll do for now."}
{"text":"I've never had better service at a mexican restaurant.  The food is great as well.  Don't skip getting the cheese dip.  It is killer.  Our 9 month old boy knocked over my drink as soon as I got it.  The staff was so friendly with getting it cleaned up and making sure our experience was excellent.  I think that this is now my go to mexican restaurant in University Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ok, first off I have frequented many, many  Mexican restaurants. I have ordered from the usual mexican/american menu. I was anticipating the usual when my wife and I stepped into Don Pedro's. I was in for A BIG surprise! This restaurant deserves a stand-alone location. To simplify, this place knows how to take care of customers and deliver superior, quality food. If you ever get the chance to sit in the bar area then I would advise you to ask for Hector - actually, I recommend you ask for Hector. By far the best Bartender I have ever befriended. I LOVE this place and hands down there is no other!"}
{"text":"Good chorizo. Not a fan of the salsa they bring out or the yellow cheesethey sprinkle on the dishes but everything else is good."}
{"text":"Hello Friends, (Its been awhile)  We ventured out today in hopes of finding something \"new\". I was in the area so we popped in. Reading the review of another yelper we tried this place out. When entering the location you have the \"bar\" to the right and the dining area to your left.   Pretty nice looking bar from what I saw. I'll have to come back and pony up to it at another time.  Table Side Guac.... umm umm good. (Albeit too good. I ate way too much of it.) 2 different kinds of salsa, Thick, and Runny.  Ordered 2 Margarita's (no no no.. not JUST FOR ME.. but my gf also) = 15.00 We both ordered the number 37 (thanks for the tip Shaun R.)  I ate way too much salsa and chips (came out pretty hot.. thats a good thing). Trying to soak up the liq. in those margarita(s). Ok ok.. I \"helped\" my gf finish hers' off.   The wait was a bit long for the amount of pp in the building. (maybe 4 other tables 2 already had their food)  Food, Drink & Tip for two = about 33.00. 15.00 of the 33.00 was for the 2 drinks.. I think thats a pretty good bargain. Since I STILL have leftovers.   We came in around 2:15pm (Lunch special 11am - 3pm)  This place get the Arnold (I'll Beee BacccK) see pics"}
{"text":"Went here last week with a group of four. The service was prompt and courteous. We ordered guacamole and chips. The guac was super fresh and flavorful. I think they might put cilantro and lime in it?? Let's get to what elevates Don Pedro above all other restaurants, Mexican or otherwise. THE HARVEY WALLBANGERS. Don Pedro is well known for having the best Harvey Wallbangers this side of the Mississippi. You wouldn't expect it, but they mix some incredible old school cocktails. Go to Mr. Pedro's, ask for a Harvey Wallbanger and tell 'em that ol Chris sent ya."}
{"text":"Waitress was good. Got our food & didn't really like it. I tried to eat it but barely touched anything but the rice. I was full on chips and didn't feel like I could eat another dish. When I asked for it to be taken off the bill (which I NEVER do), the manager YELLED at me. My boyfriend and I were appalled. He was being beyond rude, so much my boyfriend almost lost his cool and had to ask the manager to leave the table. Needless to say.. we will never return. Nothing was resolved and we paid $35 for food we were grossed out by."}
{"text":"Always excellent!  I travel for business frequently in this area, and I always make at least one (or two!) stops here.  The staff is exceptionally friendly, food is fresh and delicious, and Kevin will make you an amazing margarita fresca while you wait.  Recommend the table side guacamole and the sopa de Cameron-- the house special chicken and rice is also delicious (and big!).  Highly recommended.  A++"}
{"text":"While passing through on the way from Florida back home to Ohio, we stopped here for dinner. The staff was incredibly friendly and efficient, the food was great and the portions were very large for the price. In addition, the atmosphere was very welcoming. We'll definitely visit again if the opportunity allows."}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor of the Don Pedro!  Don't let the location detour you.  As long you come when the mariachi band isn't there - you're good!  I'm pretty sure my ears have almost exploded when they have played beside my table!  But for authenticity purposes, the band is pretty cool :)  Typical delicious mexican food - the queso is really good - margaritas are delicious and they give you free dessert at the end (which I never need, but always eat)."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible. I had to ask for a fork three times before a server actually brought it to my table. The entire staff was watching the soccer game of Barcelona vs Sevilla. The dude at the bar was not friendly at all and he seemed rather pissed because he was missing the game. Every time I said thank you he never acknowledged it. When they finally brought me the check, it took me 15 seconds to pull my card and put it on the table, but it took their servers almost 10 minutes to come pick it up. Terrible service, beware."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  I have found a new favorite Mexican Restaurant.  I had the chalupa combo.  The chalupa was a very large portion and the food was extremely fresh.  My true test of a Mexican restaurant is how their guacamole tastes.  Theirs was at the top of what I've had.  Service was excellent, very attentive and kept notice of anything that I needed; more drink, more salsa & chips.    Can't wait for my next trip."}
{"text":"Amazing food... I love Mexican food and they have awesome service... End of the day this is the place to go if you like Mexican food... At least try it once, you won't regret it...."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the Mexican pavillion at Epcot, a little. As in overdone, but awesome. Hello, 2 story waterfall. The menu is exactly the same as Azteca's, so that's a plus, since Azteca is decent, veg-friendly tex-mex. Pretty sure they're all part of the same local chain. Service is always over the top terrific and we end up leaving a 40% tip often since the bill is always so low - the most expensive thing I've ever ordered here was 9.50.  Chips are good and plentiful. Nothing here is blow you away, but most of it is passable, sometimes even good. Don't order the huevos rancheros - probably the least impressive thing on the menu.   My favs, at both Pedro's and Azteca, are the Enchiladas de Espinaca - rice, beans, and fresh spinach-stuffed flour tortillas smothered in queso sauce. Yeah, there's veggies in there, but this is heart attack land.  Another fav - machos burrito. I guess eating cactus puts hair on your chest. Its a pickle burrito. It is awesome. Have them add some fresh jalapenos for a kick. Its as big as your head, so you'll take some home - fry an egg, stick it on top, you got yourself 3 dollar brekkie.  And hey, since Skandalos is right next store, you could stuff your face AND see mexican heavy metal, all in one night. Hell yeah."}
{"text":"The shredded beef burrito and lunch fajitas are really good. A great place to eat lunch."}
{"text":"A friend from out of town and I were driving through the Uni area in Charlotte looking for somewhere to stop for lunch when she suggested the giant orange building we were driving by... for some reason I had never seen this giant glaringly bright orange building before, but figured what the hell, let's eat at the orange place.  I was surprised to find out it was a Don Pedro, I frigging love Don Pedro! Why didn't anybody tell me this was here? The atmosphere is great, the interior is very Mexican. They give you THREE salsas, 3 free salsas when you sit down and warm chips.  Then the guacamole cart rolls on by, that stuff is awesome.   The staff here is attentive, friendly and helpful with the menu.  And the menu, ahh.. the menu, it's huge! I've had the tacos and ACP, both great choices.  This is truly one of the best Mexican joints in Charlotte and I'm so happy they opened in the University area!  And anywhere I get to show off my high school Spanish skills is a win in my book."}
{"text":"Overpriced taco bell food....literally served food on taco bell shells and served as Mexican tacos.  The only things that saves this place is the service and fresca margaritas"}
{"text":"Super late super crowded middle of the week.  No picadillo only ground beef or chicken  but the chicken chimichanga was tasty especially for a quick strip mall shopping center joint.  Clean restaurant and good wait staff.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Don Pedro. Let me start by saying that the service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and available at a moment's notice.   The food was good but not the best I've had. But decent nonetheless. I really liked their guacamole.   All in all, a solid Mexican restaurant worthy of a return visit."}
{"text":"Family and I have been going here for 15 years. Always have good service, friendly staff, and hot and timely meals. Best Mexican around!"}
{"text":"Real Mexican food served by real people not food that tastes like paper. They give you a lot of food for a fair price. It is so worth it and the food tastes like it was made in Mexico. Best spot for Date night or for the whole family to enjoy."}
{"text":"Our favorite go to for great Mexican dishes.  Fresh table side guacamole is always perfect.  Dos Amore is my go to,  fish n shrimp ... superb!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant - excellent service and tostadas!  Very reasonably priced.  I usually get the tostadas.  Pico de gallo is very flavorful."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Don Pedro's for years now, and at this point would probably need a 12 step program to stop.  In fairness, I tend to find one thing on a menu that I love and stick with it forever. I have been sticking with chicken fajitas, arroz con pollo, and bites of my husband's chicken burrito when he's not looking. All of them are great! It's sort of hit or miss as far as how much of any one ingredient you're going to get in the fajitas, but I've never felt like I was robbed of something. I am also incapable of coming in here without ordering a big bowl of liquid cheese. Although I order \"queso\", and every time the servers, all of whom speak Spanish as a first language, confirm by asking \"cheese dip?\", probably because they don't want to assume cultural responsibility for what is essentially a bowl of melted white american cheese with diced jalapenos. They should take ownership, because it's so good that I really only use the endless baskets of delicious chips to consume it because eating the cheese with a spoon or a straw would be rude. The complimentary pico is almost always fantastic- surprisingly fresh. The complimentary salsas are not my favorite. They taste almost ketchup-y.  The staff is great. They're so nice and friendly- I adore Vanessa, who has an uncanny memory, and who has a closer relationship with my kids than my own sister does. Vanessa is always polite, friendly, efficient, and does her job well. With other servers I get exceptional service probably 90% of the time, with the other 10% being described as \"really good service\".  Prices are great, although I should note I only go for lunch. I think lunch fajitas are $7, and the portion size is good. I always have leftovers (this could be partially because I eat my own weight in chips and cheese dip before lunch arrives).  The ambiance is what you would expect. It's a big space, and clean, but with that vague hint that maybe all of the patterns and colors are hiding uncomfortable amounts of dirty. Whatever, I can't confirm it, and I've never seen anything to suggest it, so it clearly doesn't bother me too much.  Overall, clearly I love this place or I wouldn't keep coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to grab Mexican food for a late lunch (3 pm on a Sunday) while we were out shopping and decided on Don Pedro between 4-5 different options within a couple of miles. It was a first time for both of us and everything we experienced was above and beyond our expectations!   First the place was packed, which we took as a good sign, and there were waitstaff buzzing all over the place so even amidst the rush everyone seemed to be very well taken care of. Each table gets 2 free baskets of chips/salsa but then for the 3rd or more you pay $2-3. We didn't want/need any more chips than we got but I can see this being a turn off for larger parties that may really power through multiple baskets.  We were each going to get a margarita and our server told us about their giant sized one which is basically served in a fishbowl. We think it was easily 3-4 regular sized drinks in one huge glass. We got the frozen lime and it was SO GOOD! Perfectly creamy, flavored and frothy! Seriously, I don't know what it was about it but the margarita had a creaminess to it like a pina colada and we were definitely not complaining! It was delicious and so much better than having icy bits and chunks blended in.   Meal wise one of us got the Chimichanga and the other got a steak burrito. Both were paired with rice and beans (refried or black) and were served on HUGE plates with plentiful servings. It was honestly so much food that between snacking on chips and sipping our margaritas we both ended up taking nearly half of our food home.   One REALLY COOL thing to look out for at this restaurant is their guacamole cart that rolls around to your tableside and they make fresh guac right there in front of you! There are two different size options and they can kind of customize it for you, too. Super cool to watch them make it from scratch.  One last thing of note is that this restaurant has a very large interior and plentiful parking... perfect for large groups of people! They have large corner booths but also really long banquet tables. Other than their bar area the place is pretty open, so you lack the privacy of a back room, but there is definitely plenty of room to host a large and social dinner party!   Actually one last LAST thing is that we learned right as we were leaving that late night they turn into a mariachi club of sorts between 10 pm- 2 am!"}
{"text":"I've been several times now, and more impressed each time. Great service-- sometimes TOO often coming by to ask how their new \"amigo\" is...but that's a small issue. Great food, with good variety on the menu. LOTS of it too. By far my favorite Mexican in this area."}
{"text":"LOVE THE FOOD HERE Portions are so much more than the cost!  Pollo Con Crema (chicken strips, green peppers, onions in sour cream sauce w/ beans, rice, tortillas) Don Juan Special Burrito (chicken breast & spinach topped w/cheese dip & pico de gallo)"}
{"text":"We are in the Gold room and it was nice! The decor was great! Margaritas was great and it was cinco de mayo. The portion size of the seafood quesadilla was large and enough for 4 people."}
{"text":"Always a solid choice.  It is our go to restaurant.  Carne Asada tacos and fresh made guac is awesome!"}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican, well Americanized Mexican, so I went to Don Pedro's.  It was a Sunday afternoon about 1 pm and the restaurant was very busy, but I was able to get a table right away.  The basket of chips and bowl of salsa appeared right away too.  The chips and salsa were OK, but I've had better.    My waiter came by and got my drink order not shortly there after.  While waiting for my drink I decided on the Deluxe Burrito.  The server came back with my drink and took my order.  The staff seemed very friendly and even though the restaurant was about 80% full the were taking care of business.  I even spotted a manager or two wandering through the room checking on things as well.  It is always a good sign when you see management doing that.  My burrito came out pretty quickly.  The burrito & the plate were super hot, temperature wise, and the server was quick to warn me about that when he set it down on the table.  The burrito was big, covered with melted cheese, and loaded up with sour cream and guacamole.  I had to wait a couple of minutes for it to cool down past molten lava stage to take a bite.  It was pretty good, I wished I had looked at the menu closer as it didn't come with rice and beans.  But, it was big enough to fill me up so it really didn't matter.  The food is pretty good, nothing to wow you, but tasty non the less.  The service was outstanding.  Even with the restaurant being 80% full with several large tables I always felt taken care of."}
{"text":"This location is the best. Large eating area,patio and bar. Food has always been awesome even with the different stuff I've tried. My favorite is a fajita fundida. It's like fajita stuff with cheese. It's really good. The cheese dip is fantastic as well. I highly recommend this place and this location."}
{"text":"Great service,  festive atmosphere, good food.    The margarita pitcher was a little weak and had way too much ice for my liking.  Otherwise tasty!  The food has been consistently good,  the steak fajitas were yummy.  Would return again!"}
{"text":"It was good.   Customer service was excellent, wait staff was on point and did not complain after several items were taken back to kitchen at my comrade's request and brought back out. Food didn't look messed with in anyway. lol  They have cactus/napoles!  I've never tried this, and didn't want a full portion size meal (since I ate before I came out with my friends); they were very accommodating. I was able to order a side of cactus, they brought it out in a fairly full salad with red onions, cilantro and tomatoes. Cooked cactus tastes similar to cooked green beans. One of my friends didn't want her sides of rice and beans so I munched on that as well.  I took my leftovers for dinner today at work.  Great outdoor seating area!"}
{"text":"We love coming here for lunch during the week. Get here early, though, because this place fills up fast. Everyone at the table loved their meals (arroz con pollo, shrimp fajitas, chorizo con huevos), but we all agree that the salsa is a little thin and the chips a little thick for our taste... trust me, though, that didn't stop us from eating several baskets full! Parking can be a challenge, especially for bigger cars because the spaces are quite skinny. The little strawberry chip with whipped cream at the end of your meal is nice, too. Also, they never mind splitting the check for you (a requirement for a work group lunch). When the weather is nice, there is a small patio (covered), too."}
{"text":"Went here with the husband one of the first evenings they were open maybe a month or two ago. This place by far has the best service with super friendly and helpful staff. If weather permits, seating in the outdoor patio is a must! Very nice waterfall wall and palm trees beg you to order just one more margarita. I wasnt too hungry so ordered taco salad, which was good, but the meat was a bit bland (but no doubt, still good food... And cheap!), and the hubby ordered carne asada which was delish.  Trying to talk the other half into taking me back for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Usually I don't post horrible reviews but the fact that tonight was by far the WORST experience that I've had even though I understand that they've been busy. Worst hostess ever I'm sorry, i wouldn't complain if we weren't being crossed off on the waiting list? BUT seeing people coming in after us? Yeah, that's a problem for me. All I'm saying is I wish you guys would have more respectful workers otherwise I don't see myself coming back to this place. But thanks I rather not have spent another dime on this place, & went to another place to have had better service."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Great prices. Both big pluses that everyone in the area suddenly realizes at noon every work day. The place goes from pleasantly populated to crazy crowds clamoring for burritos. But alas, no burritos are forthcoming from the kitchen, just more harried waiters.  Go here of you want those pluses. But don't go at rush hour."}
{"text":"After hearing and reading great things, I was very excited to check out Don Pedro's. The outside is a little run down, but surprising inside it has  a great Mexican feel. Upon arriving I was seated and unlike most Mexican restaurants, who bring chips and salsa immediately, I waited over ten minutes for the chips to arrive & place my drink order. I also chose to order the cheese dip w/ jalapeños! The chips were was cold & stale, blah. I asked for a fresh batch when the cheese dip arrived and the 2nd batch were the exact same. Unfortunately the cheese dip had no flavor, was cold, and the jalapeños were obsolete. On to the meal...I chose a chicken burrito & ground beef taco. Both had NO flavor. Everything was so bland I added salt to everything. The service was just as disappointing, as I had to ask for a refill b/c I could not find my waiter, even though there seemed to be about 10 employees just standing around. Overall, there are too many other great Mexican restaurants. So disappointed, as I had hoped to really enjoy it."}
{"text":"So, in search for another restaurant, that I was unable to find, I decided to check out Don Pedro's.  It was around noon on Sunday afternoon and I was seated at a nice booth in the bar.  I was immediately greeted with chips and salsa, which probably was my least favorite part of the meal. The chips were just okay, not bad, but definitely not good.  However, the salsa, way to runny for my liking, and it had somewhat of a tomato sauce flavor. I ordered a house margarita, why not, it was after 12 on a Sunday, and the lunch chicken fajitas. The margarita hit the spot and definitely had a good kick of tequila. Honestly, I debated a second, ha ha! The fajitas came out sizzling with peppers and onions and just the right amount of chicken.  I received rice, beans, guacamole, lettuce and sour cream with four flour tortillas. The entree was great and I loved the beans and guacamole.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but do wish the salsa and chips were better, fresh and more salsa like. And, other Yelpers raved about the service, which I thought was just okay.  Maybe it was being in the bar, but there were other tables around me and I felt the bartender was overwhelmed.  If I am in the area I would definitely give Don Pedro's another visit, especially for the margaritea."}
{"text":"Managed to squeeze in some foodie time during a weekend trip to Charlotte, the food here was absolutely delicious.  The plates were big and plentiful. Definite going to be a stop every time I visit."}
{"text":"Ok. Review from Ms Picky eater. Don Pedro's has me hooked. The food is so fresh and flavorful. Not over seasoned either. This is my second time here and both times service was excellent and food was wonderful. I will say though that their portions are shareable. There is no way I could possibly eat even a third of what they served. Of course being a previous restaurant owner I'm screaming \"food cost\". Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING; Margaritas are strong; the bartender was incredibly nice, and i'll likely go back once I move to Charlotte just to say hello to him.   Side note: The guacamole that they make fresh in front of you is AMAZING, but costs around 9$ which seemed a little much."}
{"text":"I like their food.  But my husband wasnt happy. We ordered out and was suppose to get something my brother suggested and it was wrong. We called to let them know and the girl on the phone told my husband he was lying his food was right. We had to drive back and show them they messed up the food. We gave the food back and got our money back and have not been there since."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. The food was not flavored a lot, no hot sauce on the table, which for a Mexican restaurant seems really weird and I had to send my margarita back to be remade. The server we had was terrific but I probably won't return for the food."}
{"text":"After five years, we're back to Don Pedro for a late lunch on the weekend. It hasn't changed at all. My daughter and I ended up in one of the booths along the wall.  The food is still good and the portions are -massive-. The plate in the entryway is what you're going to end up with so be ready. I had the Deluxe Burrito and there was a ton of it. It might be hard to tell in my picture, but buried under that sour cream and guacamole is a large burrito stuffed with chicken.  My daughter chose the chicken fajitas and there was also a lot there. Only three tortillas, but plenty of chicken, onions and peppers.  Drinks were refilled. The queso is no longer a problem - it probably wasn't poured into a cold bowl so it stayed cheesy until our entrees arrived.  Service was quick. Table-side guacamole is available too.  If you're looking for fancier Mexican, you've found it. Don Pedro is a step above the usual Mexican places along Burrito Way."}
{"text":"This place is clean, fast, inexpensive and good! I have never had dinner here, but I do grab a quick lunch two or three times a month and they never disappoint. The staff is friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Disappointed!! I been to don pedro restaurants before, but this was my first time at this location. The place was almost empty so we got seated right away. Five minutes later our waitress arrived not very friendly at all. I  order sopa de tortilla witch I usually enjoy having (even when is hot). 20 minutes later pass after a got my soup. it was served in a huge bowl, boiling hot.the taste was nasty it tasted like water with grease and dry chile.big chunks of chicken I mean DISGUSTING ...THE waitress didn't bother to ask how the foo d was.she took my bowl exactly how it was  served! poor service & flavorless food. never coming back!!"}
{"text":"This place used to have the best tex/mex food around. Now not so much anymore. Got Carne Asada and grilled shrimp today, shrimp WAY over cooked and the beef, even though it was pretty rare, as I asked, it was tougher than shoe leather. Too bad. I've eaten here probably 50 times and lately it's been on a constant down hill slide. Maybe that explains the forever empty parking lot.   AND - They are not 2nd amendment friendly. I've spent 58 years of my life in the university area and seen restaurants come and go. Maybe it's time for this one to just go ..."}
{"text":"This spot was cool, the karaoke was hilarious and awesome. The food was ok, i didn't like the salsa and guacamole."}
{"text":"The steak quesadilla sinchronisa is my favorite! So deliciously good and fulfilling! I was miserably happy and full all day!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the great reviews this place has. It's close to work so we gave it a shot. My enchilada had melted cheddar cheese in it, you can imagine how hard it was to even swallow. Rice was dry, didn't get a single refill. Salsa and chips were fresh. Like another reviewer mentioned, it's like Taco Bell on a plate, but not as good. Shredded lettuce everywhere, but never a scoop of sour cream or a touch of guacamole. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I dined here a couple of weeks ago for the 10th time. I have had lunch here many times and dinner once. This place is good. I have tried many different entrees and have never been disappointed. The restaurant is not going to blow you away but it will not disappoint either. The service is always good. The restaurant is clean and modern. Overall price/value is good. Good spot if you are craving Mexican fare. This is a great spot to bring someone for their birthday. Let the hostess know in advance and your birthday person will have a pleasant surprice. Good place for groups."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! All our food came out ice cold! The cheese inside the kids quesadilla was not even melted. My husband got the Mexican stir fry. Veggies were all cold. The melted cheese on top was hard cold and rubbery the chili rellano was cold and soggy but they pored sauce on top that was hot to cover up the cold pepper. I got skirt steak that was burnt I wouldn't feed it to my dog. It was like dried out flavorless beef jerky. I had them remove mine from the check. I told the manager about the cold food. His response was \" our food is hot when it's first cooked but if the servers don't pick it up right away it will get cold under the light that's why the plates are so hot\" I said \"and that's ok with you\". I'm not interested in a hot plate I'm interested in hot food.  Will never go back!! Next time we will Waite patiently the hour and a half at Los Aztecas on 521 in Indian Land. Now that place is delicious.  Which is probably why there was a long Waite on a Friday night and Don Pedro was like a ghost town."}
{"text":"Very good food! You get a lot of food for your money. The servers are always very friendly and attentive as well. I always get nachos and everything is DELICIOUS, I even purchased their Groupon deal. Only reason they don't get 5 stars is because their \"birthday song\" for guests is extremely loud and disruptive. They use loud whistles, bells and the whole nine, you can't even hear the people at your table while it's going on. Other than that, great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had the special but not sure what it was called, very large portion of food though. The chicken was decent but the shrimp absolutely amazing! Service was friendly and the wait was not relatively short for a semi busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"As previous reviews have stated, the portions here are HUGE! I ordered a Deluxe Chicken Burrito and certainly was not disappointed. We started off with their chips, salsa, and table side guacamole. The chips are a bit thicker than I like, but tasty nonetheless. The salsa is quite thin and the guacamole isn't overwhelming with lime and salt like some other restaurants.   The staff hasn't been very warm and welcoming, but I wasn't expecting southern hospitality from a traditional Mexican joint. They are attentive and refill beverage/chips/salsa.   My boyfriend ordered the steak fajitas and I'm a little jealous of the flavorful sauce in which they've marinated the meat. The \"fixings\" they serve along the fajitas are just the same as what is served on top of my burrito; guacamole, lettuce, sour cream, tomato with rice and beans alongside. He was a little disappointed with that, but it worked perfectly with my meal.   All in all, Don Pedro is definitely a location I will try again to see if there are even better GIANT meals to enjoy."}
{"text":"Good food and margaritas, especially for the price. Was disappointed that the \"table side\" guacamole was made in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I go here quite often with the family and its always consistent. The people are friendly, the food is good. Its fairly typical Mexican fare. I think most of these restaurant's must get their menu and supplies from the same place. I went to a Mexican restaurant in Charleston, with a different name, almost the exact same menu. Azteca-same menu too.   Here you start off with free chips and salsa. You can get fresh guacamole made at your table. A nice touch. They have a great white cheese dip. Be careful not to fill up on the free chips, because you have a boat load of food coming out.   I like the Burrito Azteca (mix of chicken, shrimp), with enough cheese and sour cream poured on top to croak you. You get a giant plate with beans, rice, and your burrito. My wife got the steak quesadilla. Again, huge. My daughter got a \"small combination\", enchilada, rice, beans. My other daughter a streak fajita. We always have enough food left over for lunch the next day. And I usually leave here thinking, \"why did I eat so much?\"  Add in a cold Pacifico brew or a Top Shelf Margarita and you have a pretty decent meal.  The atmosphere is just ok. Its in a strip mall after all. But its clean. They recently installed new tables, lights, etc. The staff is friendly. They have an outside seating area if you like. I've sat there before, but tend to not like it because of flies.  All in, a pretty solid meal. Not the most healthy and not something you'll get too exited about, but pretty good. I find myself coming back, again and again."}
{"text":"Never, ever again will I darken their door. The waiter was way too touchy feely and flirty for my liking. After we ordered he suddenly turned to rude, I guess because neither of us ordered an alcoholic drink (which he took 3-4 minutes to list and explain in detail).   The fact that their chips were stale should have been an immediate turn off but we decided to order anyway. Bad plan, I feel sick today and I definitely don't think it's a coincidence :(  The girl who refilled our chips was rude and according to the menu only the first 2 baskets of chips are free, after that they are $3. Seriously? They aren't good... who's ordering multiple baskets??  This was just not a good experience overall and the staff was not helpful or pleasant. I won't be back and I hope others will follow suit."}
{"text":"I've tried every other Mexican place in this area and was hoping this one was going to be different.  Normally Mexican places excel in service.  This one started out below average when I walked in the door.  The restaurant was about 1/2 full.  I was the only one waiting and I waited 10 minutes for someone to seat me.  Chips and salsa arrived soon as well as my waiter.  I ordered a chorizo burrito off of the lunch special menu. Normally food at a mexican place comes out almost immediately.  I waited an excessive amount of time for my food which was quite disappointing.  When the food finally arrived it was flavorful but a bit dry.  I had to moisten both the burrito and the rice with the salsa.  The refried beans were actually good but a bit hot in temperature.  I think Don Pedro's is worth a second chance.  Except for the dryness of the burrito and the initial service issues, the food had great flavors."}
{"text":"I used to come to this restaurant all the time but each time something has gone completely wrong.  On my latest visit here, they sat me in the middle with a bunch of other people.   What I don't like about the table seating here is unless you are in a booth, you are seated right on top of another table.  There may be 2 or 3 inches between you and the next table which makes conversations open to everyone around you.  So I got over the seating issue and look at the menu.  My server brings my drink quickly and then asks me if I'm ready to order.  No...she only gave me 2 minutes to look at a very extensive menu.  Well it was like 10 minutes before she came back again after that.    I decide on a deluxe taco salad which comes with guac and sour cream in addition to the salad.  Oh yeah, I ordered chicken.   So it comes out and it's a half-stale tortilla bowl with tons of shredded lettuce, cheddar cheese and slightly seasoned ground beef.  Chicken???????   I received just an additional dollup of guac and sour cream off to the side on top of more lettuce.  Do I look like a rabbit?   Oh yeah don't forget that half frozen slice of tomato.   The whole thing was so unappetizing and it tasted the same way.  I had to dump salsa on it to give it a least a tad bit of flavor.  Honestly, I've had better taco salads at Wendy's and Taco Bell and I think a chinese restaurant could do better at this.  So I can shoot myself for not going to Moe's like I had planned.  Oh yeah, I thought, this place gets so busy that it deserved another try.  Yeah right...  Moral of this story,, always trust your gut feeling.  The alternative is never worth it!"}
{"text":"Visited Charlotte back in July 2015 for Oly lifting clinic for my kids.  Asked the girl at nearby starbucks where to find a chipotle. After discovering there were none really close and still craving \"mexican\" type dishes...She pointed me to Don Pedro's.  I ordered Arroz con Pollo which is my go to dish back home in Virginia. But wow, there version of this plate blew my mind. Next time I am anywhere near Charlotte I am making a special trip for this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Salsa needs a little more kick, but this is the Carolinas, lol."}
{"text":"Daisy was such an awesome server told us the best suggestions. Food came out and fast and bar drinks were delicious!"}
{"text":"Always down for a new Mexican spot. So i decided to try them out for the first time after always passing them by. Figure they may be sort of a big deal since another Mexican restaurant i frequently visit mentioned Don Pedro's one day in anger as if Don Pedro's was their biggest competitor. So i said \"self\" lets go see what the hoopla about.   When i arrived the one thing that stood out to me here was the employees all were dressed alike in gear from their culture which i off the bat thought was cool. The next thing that strikes me for sure is the bar. Someone put some kind of thought into the skull as the backdrop of the bar etc.  Now lets get to the food. You guys i am so mad because i accidentally deleted all of my pictures from my phone except for my drink, which i had a mango margarita. I ordered a chicken/rice and beans platter which was pretty good, the rice was a little dry but everything for the most part was OK.   The staff here, everyone and i mean everyone was super friendly, and attentive. I don't know rather or not this is protocol but once i finished up my meal my waiter brought me out what appeared to be some type of sweet dessert chip with which cream and strawberries on top. Small gestures always win almost anyone over. I have to make it a point to come back and try out other meals on the menu."}
