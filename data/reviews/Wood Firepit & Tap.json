{"text":"Wow!

Wood opened in the past year in a neighbourhood where they were competing with an established smokehouse. We were reluctant to stop in at first, not wanting to cheat on our other restaurant. That has changed!

We stopped in tonight and enjoyed a fabulous selection of meat. Unfortunately, they were out of brisket but our beef ribs and pulled pork were off the chart.

Speaking of off the chart, don't even get me started on the fabulous play-list!

Thanks for a wonderful evening! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came by late on Friday night as the place was winding down for the night.  Found the service to be excellent in spite of the late hour.  Very friendly and informative.  Ordered the trio of pulled chicken, brisket and pork as well as the mac & cheese side with a piece of cornbread.  All were excellent, well prepared and visually appealing.  Place is very reasonably priced and the portions are generous so a real  value.

Wood has only been open for about a month but based on our first visit, we will definitely be back.   Seems like they have things working well right out of the chute. 

 Atmosphere is OK but a little hard to tell since it was late and pretty empty."}
{"text":"Now when I walked into this place the restaurant was very open and airy and clean, a great start.  The server sat me at a table right away and gave me the menu.  I ordered the Sampler with three meats (Pulled Chicken, Pork Ribs and the Brisket) and the Baked Beans and the 4 Cheese Mac and Cheese for the sides.

    It came hot and the meat was juicy and tender.  The smoke on the Brisket and the Ribs were perfect and tasty. Portions were good as the Pulled Chicken was about 4OZ.as well as the Brisket and the Ribs were five wide bones with lots of meat on them.

   The sides need a little work but were decent.  The waitress was very attentive and friendly.

Everything considered this place was a very enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"This is a new BBQ place on Queen St E in the Beaches. Went there with six people and tried quite a selection of things.

Service was good. Very impressively, the owner stopped by all the tables to greet the customers and get feedback. We were honest with him and gave him both positive and negative feedback, which he received very well. It was a great experience to be able to chat with him and tell him our impressions. He seemed like a good guy who takes interest in his customers.  The owners actually took a food trip to the BBQ states in the US to do research and learn techniques. 

Good:
The smoked chicken wings were very good, with a seasoned rub and a crispy exterior. They come with sauces on the side, but those could be improved.  The fries were great - will have to go back and try their poutine.  Sweet potato fries were good too, but didn't come with a dipping sauce like most places, which I missed.  My tablemates enjoyed the baked beans a lot.  I loved the jalapeno cheddar cornbread.  The beef ribs were pretty tender and flavorful. 

Needs improvement:
Most of the meats need improvement.  Smoke flavor was somewhat lacking. Most of the meat was quite dry.  The pork ribs were dry and not tender.  You can see the pink smoke ring on them though. The beef ribs were better.  Pulled chicken, pulled pork, and brisket were lacking in flavor and were dry.  Pulled pork and brisket were also somewhat tough. Coleslaw was bland. The mac & cheese advertises four cheeses, but it mostly tasted like Kraft singles and mayonnaise to me (not saying that is what's in it...just how it tasted to me). BBQ sauces were just okay and I wished they had more selection of them. 

In summary, they have some tasty menu items, but most of their main BBQ needs technique improvement. Hopefully it will improve. However, I feel they are worth a shot if solely because it is refreshing to see an owner take a direct interest in the feedback and satisfaction of his customers."}
{"text":"Good bbq and good service. Poutine was great and the ribs and wings are consistently good. You have to like smokey authentic southern bbq to really appreciate the flavour. I really like their homemade bbq sauce as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner a couple of weeks ago, and being big fans of BBQ, we were quite excited! Here is a brief recap:

Excellent service. Our server was always close and very attentive. She also gave great advice on what to order.

The BBQ was excellent. We split a wood smapler platter with an extra side. The pork ribs were ridiculously good, and the pulled chicken and brisket were very good!

I always feel that it's the attention to the sides that makes or breaks a meal, as it can be so disappointing when you get an amazing mean with lousy fries. The sides were exceptional; fries, slaw and cornbread. I felt everypart of my meal was well thought out and considered.

I hope this place becomes a staple in the Beaches. I know that my wife and I are now regulars. This is a restaurant well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The first think that struck me about this place was the wonderful wood on all the tables, especially the bar. 
Whoever had this place designed has an eye for quality craftsmanship and wants to give a signal that wood-fired food is about getting the most value from wood -- not just heat from a fire but taste and preservation from the smoke -- as was true of our ancient predecessors who invented fire and cooking, two of the greatest inventions in history.
The service is super considerate and open to being friendly, if you want it friendly (which not all people do).
The portion sizes are large. My friend and I shared a $25 dollar special two-ways, which made for a reasonable lunch price.
I would say the smoke application is done lightly, which might offend smoke-eaters, but was just about right for me.
The Beaches is a tough place to develop a great restaurant scene because there are so many tourists and the rents are so high that it encourages chains that sell cheap beer and large portions of tasteless food. 
As I argue in my e-book, Food for City Building, restaurants can and should to offer so much more to a city neighborhood -- a place to hang out and meet, healthy food, introduction to food variety, prices that allow people at all income levels to enjoy a meal out, and much more. 
This place is definitely trying for this higher ideal."}
{"text":"Lived in Montreal for three years and have never experienced poutine like at Wood. Add brisket and you have a lifelong winner.

Went in on a Friday night and were seated right away with excellent service. The menu is varied, delicious looking, and VERY reasonably priced. Our drinks came right away. The table next to us were raving about their nachos.

I ordered wings with blue cheese dressing, and the four cheese mac n' cheese. My fianc√© ordered the poutine with gouda (real curds) and brisket. All excellent, my favourite was the poutine.

The lady at the table to the other side ordered one of the salad entrees. I wanted to note this because they are NOT kidding around with their salads. They're PILED with whatever meat you've ordered with it.

They carry Dufflet desserts and so you couldn't go wrong.

We had a manager and the owner come by to see how things were doing and to ask if we needed anything else. 

I was blown out of the water and hope that these guys stick around in the neighbourhood.

Will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I'll confess, I wasn't feeling very well when I went to eat here, but I had plans with my dad, and he didn't get the memo, so off I went!

As mentioned, the decor is very airy, and the tables are beautiful. It's a bit odd how the bathroom is so close to the main dining area without even an airlock. You can also see way back to where they store stuff. They could do with some swing doors to at least give a semblance of privacy. Sound really carried in the space, which wasn't pleasant.

I would appreciate it if their pop was on tap. It's those small glass coke bottles of old. While, pretty, it's a BBQ joint! 

My dad and I shared the Wood Sampler Platter. We ordered the pulled pork, beef brisket and pork ribs. For sides, we ordered the coleslaw and house cut french fries. The pulled pork was good, although I'm used to more sauce in my pulled pork. The brisket was perfectly well done, and very flavourful. I did not like the pork ribs. The rub was spicy (but my father thought they were deelish). The meat wasn't hot when it came out, which was a bit of a disappointment. I added the BBQ sauce that they had on the table to my pulled pork, but the sauce was too sweet. The only alternative was spicy, which as I mentioned before, is not my cup of tea. The coleslaw was perfect. It was just the right mix of tangy and sweet with the addition of some dried cranberries (yum). The fries were nicely spiced and were hot. Overall, it was good. I'd go again if I'm in the area, but it won't be a destination.

We ordered drinks, and all in it was less than $40.00 - which is good for a night out!

They don't take Amex.

They had several flat screens around the room to watch the game, but the screens were mounted quite high."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first visit. Poutine was very good; we shared a salad with blackened salmon and corn bread side for the entree. All was done very well. Service was friendly and prompt - interior decor is casual and inviting. A great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I ate here a week ago. The poutine was really big. Good value for money, I got the Gouda one. The mac n' cheese wasn't the best and the pulled pork sandwich lacked flavour. I also found the bun to be way too big for the filling. I like a nice bun to filling ratio. I really like the idea of this place and my boyfriend picked the food up and said the owner was really nice. So I will go back and try it again. Hopefully reviews are taken on board and the figure out the issues they are having. It's not like the food was bad, it just wasn't great. 

Premises is really clean too, which is a big plus in my book!"}
