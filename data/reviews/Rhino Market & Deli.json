{"text":"Excellent market - much needed in the neighborhood. Lunch sandwiches are solid. Employees are friendly, not pretentious. Good beer selection and rotating taps. Nice outdoor area."}
{"text":"I got the Reuben with some of the new voodoo heat chips and my friend got a chicken salad sandwich. Both are DANK. Lol, but seriously. The deli is a cool spot to grab a beer and a nice Sammy and hang out for a nice lunch. Took a peek at some other sammy's that people were eating and they all looked pretty good. This was my first time coming here but I will definitely be back, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Cool vibe. Great people.   Has a little deli window in the back with great choices. I personally thought the chicken salad sandwich was one of the best I've ever had.   Not a big wine guy, but from what I can tell, pretty good selection.   The beer selection is great. Lots of the goodies I look for. Lots of local and national offerings, plus a good selection of Belgians. Couple of cases of Wicked Weed by the register.   Don't forget to stop by the bar. They have 6-8 really good beers on tap. Quality stuff.   Glad The Rhino has opened!  Be sure to say hi to Rob when you're there. He's the man"}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get. I got the chicken torta sandwich for $8. There was very little chicken on the sandwich, and what I got was overly dry and not very flavorful. I won't be returning for the food.   The beer selection is great, but the markup is much higher than you would see at other markets. A good place to peruse, but not a great place to actually purchase."}
{"text":"Chicken Torta was great! Liked the overall ambiance & vibe too. I recommend for a casual lunch with friends."}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped here on the way home (to Columbia, SC) from the Charlotte Airport. As a vegetarian, I make sure to research places to eat to make sure I have some tasty options to avoid disappointment (and wasting time). The Rhino Market & Deli isn't far from the interstate so I knew it would be an easy stop. In addition, more than half of the menu was vegetarian! I was tempted by lots of delicious options, but ultimately went with the pimento cheese sandwich on toasted sourdough. It was perfect! The atmosphere of this place is really neat - if we were locals, we'd totally visit here more often and have lunch or dinner on their outdoor porch. I have never been to a place quite like this - it was part neighborhood bar, part tasty sandwich deli, part wine & beer shop. Very neat, comfortable atmosphere with great food! If we're back in the area, we'll surely visit again!"}
{"text":"I frequent the Rhino about 3x a week, whether it's for coffee, tea, breakfast or lunch, and I am constantly blown away by their service & quality of food. I am so happy to have them in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte from Atlanta, and decided to go to Rhino Market for lunch while a friend was in town. I could tell we had picked a great spot the minute we walked in. The Market side of Rhino has all sorts of local beverages on top of your typical sodas and beers. There was a good selection of local craft sodas, most of which I had no idea about. I also really enjoyed their selection of craft beer. We ended up buying a couple of six packs after lunch. The market also carries a variety of wines, sake, and snacks. It's definitely one of the nicest local markets I've visited.   Once we spent an obscene amount of time looking through all the offerings in the market, we decided to finally order from the deli. My friend ordered the Italian sandwich. It looked great, and she loved it. I ordered the Reuben sandwich. I love a good Reuben, so I'm typically very picky about them. The sandwich was cooked perfectly. The bread was not too thick or thin. They were very generous with the pastrami- as one should be when making a Reuben. The only complaint I had was the Creole mustard did overwhelm the 1000 island, but that's not much of a complaint because the mustard was excellent. I also picked up a small bag of Deep River Rosemary Olive Oil chips (which I'd never seen before) and they are some of the best bagged chips I've had.   My friend also ordered a beer while we were here. The tap area has a cool set up with a good selection of beers. Definitely something I look forward to trying when I go back.   As far as the service, everyone we spoke with was friendly and helpful. The time to get our food was definitely reasonable, and considering I purchased a sandwich, bag of chips, and a root beer the price wasn't bad. The quality of food was well worth the price.   Overall, I was really impressed. This is definitely a place I'll revisit. Especially since I saw they have team trivia on Mondays! There was also information about live music events they host. Definitely a great spot that should be checked out!"}
{"text":"Rhino Market is a great surprise. They have a really fun selection of non-alcoholic drinks like the apple juice spotted in Aziz's \"Master of None\" and tons of teas. Additionally they have a wide selection of beers and wines, including craft drafts. The sandwiches are alway delicious and decently prices, one of the best Rueben's around and a standup grilled cheese.  Overall its a chill atmosphere that feels like a real part of the community- i always stop by the table of cards and flyers on my way in, and they sell locally made goods as well."}
{"text":"Hit this place on Saturday.   Food was pretty good.  Definitely saw the Common Market influence.   Just doesn't have that vibe.  Maybe in time.  Good luck."}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriend (both are 25). The sandwiches were made very fast and tasted great. The whole atmosphere was very relaxed and chill. They have a ton of drink choices (alcoholic and non-alcoholic)...pretty much anything you want. I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great little market that my boyfriend and I accidentally came by! We were initially walking over to Pinky's for lunch, but something told us to swing by. We walked in and there's just rows of local beers, wine, quirky toys and a caf√© in the back of the market. It was quaint and the vibe was fresh and friendly. We spoke to a vendor there from Unknown Brewery (they're also a local joint you should try!) who gave samples and helpful when giving advice on places we should visit in the area.  Super awesome little place. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the high reviews - I had the hot Sicilian sandwich and it was amazing. Great music and functional Internet as well. Good vibe."}
{"text":"Cool cool place!   Great outdoor seating area, great bands play here on Sat nights. Cool neighborhood, great staff."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday for lunch with my husband. This place is a little tucked away off of Morehead Street but you can see the gravel parking lot from the road.   The second you walk in, you are hit with the Common Market feel. Found out later that the owner used to work at Common Market....makes sense.   Inside they have lots of canned and bottled beverages and tons of snacks (including popsicles from King of Pops). There is a deli at the back of the store and they have various sandwiches and salads. Lots of vegetarian options! Both my husband and I got the BBQ Tofu sandwich.   When the sandwiches came out they were very nice portions. The bbq tofu was abslutely delish. It was almost a bahn mi style with pickled veggies in it. Super delish. After we finished our meal, the owner came by to ask how our meals were, which was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"This is a great location. It reminds me of common market but a lot better. I love the staff and they have a great deli and store layout. The location is not too far from my house so that's even more better. This will be my new hangout spot. The patio is nice but could be a little more bigger. Keep up the great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Leaving the airport and looking for a good lunch we turned to Yelp.  A sandwich from Rhino sounded perfect.  Rhino is a deli/market/beer establishment.  They have about 15 tables some inside, some outside.  Busy when we arrived and I grabbed a table while hubby went to order.  Friday's special was a Gyro sandwich and this is a go-to favorite for us both.  He ordered two Gyro specials and we were ready for a good lunch.   The food was ready fast.  By the time hubby paid at the register food was ready at the pick up window.  Hubby took one bite of the Gyro and said, \"umm, umm, you won't like it.\"  Unfortunately he was right.  The meat had a strange flavor, there were few veggies on the sandwich and the tzatiki was watery.  I did not eat the Gyro sandwich because I didn't care for it at all.  Decided to just order another sandwich and tried the 'veggie chaud'.  I must say this was very good.  They have a lot of vegetarian options.  Maybe meat isn't their thing."}
{"text":"Had the chicken torta!   Loved it.  Order at counter in back then choose your beverage. Beer and wine available as well.. lots of treats to add on. Cookies. Chips etc. then choose a table inside or out. Orders are quick and well worth the value!"}
{"text":"The food might be great, but the costumer service is just plain terrible.   Is it Sunday and you want a breakfast burrito? Well, make sure you place your order with the cashier at or before 11:59am, because she knows and follows the rules and they do not serve breakfast in the afternoon.   Is it 12:04pm? Did you ask nicely? Doesn't matter because they definitely do not serve breakfast in the afternoon!   Did she ask the kitchen if they could prepare your breakfast order? Of course not! She has a watch, and if that watch says it's 12:04pm, that means we are already in the afternoon and, guess what, they do not serve breakfast in the afternoon!  Did she do all of the above with a fake smile on her face? Yes, she did. Did that make the whole experience even worse? Most definitely!  To conclude, if you want to interact with emotionless robots, this is the place to go. If you want to interact with human beings and eat breakfast at 12:04 on a Sunday, go to Not Just Coffee a block away. Which is what I'm doing for the rest of the week!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent salads and sandwiches that can healthy if you like. Also, solid wine section. Oh, and lots of beer. Good selection of sodas and drinks (Vernors!) as well. Indoor and outdoor seating and the breakfast menu looks great as well (only had lunch so far).  And the icing of the cake? They have a nice corner of bitters and vermouth - props for carrying Scrappy's!  I can get a good sandwich, some fancy chocolates and a bottle of Mo√´t, goofball beers for my beer friends and some bitters all in one place! Yay!"}
{"text":"The good:  Well stocked in the beer and wine department.  Small bar area with several decent taps.  Really interesting space with loft like interior. Nice outdoor patio to sit and bring your dog.  friendly and helpful staff.  The \"meh\":  sandwich was the roast beef. Most chewy, grisly piece of rubber I've ever had. Fed to dog.  Bread was good, carmalized onions were decent, way to heavy on the mustard.  The opportunities:  No real selection yet of munchies/snacks.  Small case with some cheeses and olives. Insanely high prices on random things. 13 bucks for the large Delirium is totally acceptable but 6 dollars for the regular size Owl beer is just crazy.   Overall a welcome addition to my hood. We'll stop in for that emergency bottle of wine every so often and hope there are other folks in Wesley Heights that can afford to keep this place open for us."}
{"text":"This cool little market hits all the right buttons for me: nice selection of craft beer and wine, tasty desserts and granola from Cardais Gourmet, fresh bread, unique munchies, creative & delicious kitchen menu (chicken-noodle soup - when available - is fantastic) and fun ~free~ events. Right across the street from Romare Bearden park to top it all off...I'm a regular now!"}
{"text":"I love how vegetarian, healthy and beer have all come together in a very happy matrimony at Rhino Market & Deli. This was my introduction to the foodie scene for my first visit to Charlotte and it was a great first impression. The sandwiches were great and the staff really knows their stuff. I had a tough question but they got \"the guy\" to come out and answer my question. Impressed and appreciated. Tables inside are limited but there's seating outside as well. The Sandwiches were pretty large but I agree with others, a side of some sort would be nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely blown away at the Chaud Legumes [grilled portabello, grilled zucchini, caramelized onion, grilled red pepper, mozzarella, arugula, garlic aioli on a ciabatta].  And of course, great selection of local and regional beer on tap, aside from the huge selection of bottle brews.  Great atmosphere, tons of light through the large windows (nice study spot).  Fans of Common Market will appreciate this place, which was in fact opened by a former CM employee."}
{"text":"I love this place. The employees are great. Erica, Taz, and Gordon are always nice. The food I amazing. I love  the ABLT and especially the omelette. They have wonderful sandwiches also. It is my go to place for breakfast and lunch. Thanks for being there."}
{"text":"Stopped by Rhino Market for a much anticipated salad today and was pleasantly surprised by the quality, but the price left a bad taste in my mouth. I purchased a Pollo salad with 1/2 chicken salad and 1/2 egg salad + avocado for a $2.45 up-charge. It was a whole lot of lettuce, three slivers of avocado and two small scoops of chicken/egg salad for a whopping $12.43. If the volume of protein and add-ons increase, I'd be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Rhinos only uses the freshest ingredients.  Farm fresh vegetables go into every dish.  All of their sandwiches are made fresh.  I simply Love All of their dishes.  Everyone of their staff members are very courteous and friendly.  Just as the Carolina Panthers...   I Love the relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"The BBQ Tofu sandwich is very good. Nice selection of drinks and chips also. Very friendly staff with professional customer service."}
{"text":"Rhino Market is one of my favorite spots in Charlotte. It has such a great vibe and selection. They've got the deli in the back, which churns out great sandwiches and soups. They're vegetarian friendly (highly recommednd the Tofu You). In fact, I've had the best soup of my life here. It was so good I can't even remember if it was sweet potato or butternut squash because it doesn't matter--it was THAT good!  They also have a unique, fun little marketplace with everything from beer and wine to coffee beans and fun snacks. They carry some snacks I'm not able to find anywhere else in the city. Definitely a wider range than Common Market. If I lived closer, I would constantly be running in there to get a freshly delivered baked good or funky bag of chips.   They have some seating indoors but where they really shine is their patio. One of my favorite Charlotte memories is sitting out on the patio one afternoon, enjoying my soup and the sunshine while a local duo played guitar and upright bass. They have a bunch of games out there, so I recommend grabbing a crew, ordering some sandwiches, opening a bottle of wine, and settling in for an afternoon on the patio."}
{"text":"Great and quick lunch.  Cool atmosphere.   I wish I could have had a few beers while I was here but I was working.   The beer selection was awesome and also very large wine selection.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The best!  Awesome beer selection. (They carry 3 of my fave sour beers) and Rice Krispie treats.  Who really needs more?!"}
{"text":"I'm always here because the food and service are always consistent. At least once a week, maybe twice :), I count on Rhino to fill my belly for lunch! My go-to order is the Rhino Salad with Chicken. My dressing of choice is the fresh and bright citrus vinaigrette. My other fav is the tomato based Vegetable Soup. The flavor of this soup is phenomenal. It varies slightly in the spiciness from order to order yet it remains flavorful and satisfying. They also carry my favorite plantain chips made by Artisan Tropic! Thanks Erica :).   I love the quirkiness and variety found in Rhino Market. If I'm waiting on an order, I like to browse the specialty beer and wine. I have yet to purchase any of these items. I definitely would.   Rhino gets very busy around lunch time. I'd definitely recommend you call in your order to save the wait :)."}
{"text":"Fiiii-nally! This place was long anticipated in FreeMoreWest and thankfully it delivered. I was worried the food wouldn't be any better than boring Common Market, but thankfully it is definitely better and more interesting. I was lucky enough to get a sneak peek and tasting of the menu before it opened and Rob was great about taking feedback and is still making adjustments.   The space is light, airy and lofty. At first it's jarring if you're used to Common Market, but it's actually so nice because it's not claustrophobic and cramped like CM. It's also sunny, which can be a bad thing but it's just a bit happier. I have been in there a few times where there was only outdoor seating available which isn't great if it's 45 degrees but it will be rocking this summer.   Onto the menu! The Chaud Legumes sandwich has nice warm juicy portabella mushrooms. It's super tasty on their GF (gluten free) bread option (butter lettuce) but be warned- it's so juicy it's messy. Their normal bread for that is ciabatta (ask for that grilled too). As someone else mentioned the chicken torta is substantial and delicious. It's a big hunka sandwich and great if you're a hungry hungry rhino.   The salads are also great. Their basic chicken salad is definitely light on the mayo (rejoice!) and chunky chicken, not that mushy shit people are peddling these days. It has grapes (wish their were more) and celery for crunch. Simple, but tasty and full of protein. Their Rhyno salad is delish as is their spinach bacon (add avo). Their citrus vin far outweighs their red wine vin. It's nice to see a nicoise salad in Charlotte (though I do with they'd go for it and add tuna.   Chilly? Rhino also has soups, including a daily vegan Garden Veggie Soup that is healthy, hearty and heavenly. Other daily specials change all the time. The only thing I wish is they had a crusty bread / roll to buy along with it.   I haven't tried their breakfast sandwiches / burritos but I have had their coffee (all local brews) and are delicious. Enderly coffee on tap? Yeahhhhhh.  They also have local brews and national  microbrews and a giant selection of really good wines and even bubbly ( Roederer Estate!). Rob's done a great job of selecting goodies. Their small fridge by the deli features salami, cheese, small sides of pasta & chicken salad to go, but also desserts including a locally made cheesecake company called QC cheesecake. Pumpkin bourbon cheesecake? Don't mind if I do. They also have other good looking things I shouldn't try in there as well.    It will be interesting to see how much they add over time."}
{"text":"The hardest part of moving out of the FreeMoreWest area was saying goodbye to this precious gem, The Rhino. I lived down the street for a year and I went to the Rhino at least once a week. The breakfast burritos and sandwiches are the bomb. The coffee is so good, iced and hot. The wine and beer selection are great. The whole summer I'd take my dog and sit outside with a beer or coke(in a glass bottle) and I seriously miss those days. I admit I go back every few months because I love it so much. I even have a Rhino sticker on my car, no shame."}
{"text":"I'm primarily here to discuss a quality vegetarian sandwich.   The Tofu You is so so good. It's a hot sandwich with tofu, bbq sauce, pickled veggies, served on some buttery grilled toast. I feel that often the vegetarian sandwich is created for a menu as an after thought. That no one intends it to be ordered or enjoyed. I feel whoever put this on the menu really thought about someone actually eating it! Honestly, this is the only menu item I've ever gotten, but there is a whole host of meat free sandwich choices. My boyfriend usually orders the Club and he enjoys it, but today even he agreed that I out ordered him!    The market itself has a bunch of great stuff too. Huge selection of cold drinks and chips. All around great place for lunch, especially if you are looking for a tasty meat free sandwich."}
{"text":"Badass.  Better than common market.  Get your sandwiches on the ciabatta.  But a beer.  Stay a while."}
{"text":"We were visiting our daughter and walked a few blocks to Rhino. Boy am I envious that she can walk to this place for breakfast, lunch and purchase great beer and wine. My wife and I needed a salad after spending a few days in Charleston so she recommended we eat here. I had the spinach salad with goat cheese. Excellent. My wife had the chicken salad on a bed of butter bib lettuce...excellent. We enjoyed the salads so much we came back the next day (daughter doesn't cook much) and had the Reuben and the gyro sandwiches. The Reuben was meaty and delicious. The gyro was good but I've had a few that were better but that's being pretty picky right now. Living in the area would be a treat because the staff is friendly and chill and I would wander over to sit outside and sample one of the 8 or so craft beers on tap or grab a bottle of wine and enjoy a good read. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best measure of an establishment's customer service is how they respond when things don't go as planned -- which is to be expected from even the best run places. After a small mishap with my order (I was given the wrong person's food, which I didn't discover until I had already returned to my hotel room), Rhino Market not only replaced my sandwich but gave me a gift card which I used to purchase an accompanying spinach salad -- all of which was delicious.  I will be sure to return the next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I didn't try the food so I'm going by the laid back atmosphere. It's similar to common market. You can buy wine, beer and here's a bar for beer on tap or glasses of wine. The deli sandwiches all sound amazing and they sell lots of snacks too! They have different events throughout the week. For example, poetry readings on Thursdays. There's not much sitting space though, only 4-5 tables. Great spot to grab lots of craft beers!"}
{"text":"We're members of the Fencing Academy next door and love that this place moved in next door.  Finally had a quick dinner the other night.  My picky son had a grilled cheese on sourdough with cheddar and declared it the best grilled cheese EVER (it was awesome).  My daughter had a chicken sandwich on sourdough with swiss - I had half and it was like homemade - not sliced chicken but cut off the baked chicken - so awesome!  Plus wine by the glass, draft beer, tons of gourmet, unusual things to try.  Friendly and helpful staff, outdoor picnic tables - we're in heaven.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. It's not been open for too long but I'm kicking myself for not coming in sooner. They have made perfect use of the space with a market area, a deli area along with tables to sit down and eat and a beer counter with about 8 beers on tap. The staff is friendly and helpful. Oh and the sandwiches are great, at least the 2 that the wife and I devoured last Friday. She choose the veggie one called chaud legume, and I was recommended the Reuben over the chicken torta, but I will return soon to get a chicken torta. She grabs a lenny boy kombucha and I get a beer.  Sometimes there is nothing like a greasy deli sandwich to hit the spot. My Reuben had the perfect mix of ingredients, the pastrami, the creole mustard, the kraut, they were all damn tasty. You know that you have a great menu with all the different meat and vegetarian options. We will definitely be frequent flyers!"}
{"text":"Really skeptical because I'm not a vegetarian but wow was I impressed. Corned beef was tasty and jambalaya was incredible! Friendly folks and a nice atmosphere. Also some interesting local beer!"}
{"text":"I seriously had a revelation as I was about to write my review on Rhino Market, my parents had a convenient store when I was a kid and sitting in Rhino, gives me the same feeling as sitting in my dad's business, but you too can enjoy Rhino Market even if your parents didn't own Island Grocery. Here are my top reasons! 1. RETAIL DRINKING! Love, love, love paying retail for wine. No need for explanation.  2. Great sandwiches and salads, made with love, reasonable pricing and you can eat healthy while you cancel it out with a bottle of bubbles. 3. Self serve coffee, locally roasted and freshly brewed. 4. Location, location, location, I always find parking on the street. 5. Beer Mecca. If you haven't been, go check it out and pretend you're sitting in my parent's store."}
{"text":"Ah the Rhino - what a great little local haunt!  Somewhere between a craft beer bottle shop, a deli, a mini mart, and a neighborhood hangout, this place is cozy and wonderful.  They've got free wifi and some seating if you want to sit down and get some work done while you sip on a beer, and the staff's always got an interesting story to share.  There's loads of beer by the bottle, and a handful of taps, and a good selection of wine and soft drinks, including lots from local sellers.  The food is really great, too.  I love their BLT with Avocado (called the ABLT, but really, we all know it should be called \"BLAT BLAT BLAT BLAT\" because that sandwich is gangsta as hell).  Stop in, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wonderful market and deli. Lots of craft beverages, including local ginger ale and ginger beers."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos and coffee from multiple local and small roasters for breakfast.  Sandwiches and daily specials for lunch. Try the chicken torta. Large craft beer selection both small releases and house hold favorite.  Wines champagne and snacks of all types as well. Really just a great spot with friendly staff always there to help ya out!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I ordered my food at 11:30 because by 12 the line for food was LONG! But it seems like the wait time was not long. I had a spinach and bacon salad. It was very fresh and yummy! I sat outside in the shade while enjoying my salad. I can't wait to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Decided to try This place after driving by it several times and reading about them in various publications. We ordered the Chaud Legume and Avocado BLT sandwiches which were quite tasty.  A side of Dirty Chips and a green tea beverage completed a quick and inexpensive lunch. Definitely an asset to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot to pick up some beer or snacks. It's very similar to the Common Market but on the west side and not quite a quirky. The beer selection is fantastic and full of local favorites.   Trivia is Fun on Monday nights but get there early to get a good spot."}
{"text":"Finally a place to call home on the Westside. Westside residents may love their old trees & greenway but while Dunkin Donuts has wifi & Pinky's has delicious food there's hasn't been a place to just be.  Started by a former Common Market employee with the CM owner's blessing, Rhino Market offers their own interpretation of the familiar CM format of great beer & wine selection with a delicious deli. You won't find the exact CM deli menu here so embrace it as a chance to find a new favorite. High quality breads, meats & cheeses with plenty of vegetarian options remain at core.  The space is new so it lacks the gritty character of PM or Southend but I'm sure it's own decor & identity will come with time. There's a paper bag of \"good ideas\" for a suggestion box if you find anything lacking. There's seating inside of a couple tables and a booth & two bars with stools. One is just sitting the other is by the 10 taps for your tasting pleasure."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by Rhino Market to fuel up before going on a long walk to take advantage of 70 degree weather in February (Yay for living in NC). First off, this place is where I suspect the hipsters hang out before they make their daily migration to Central. However they have a top notch deli, impressive beer and wine selection, and a ton of local products.  We mainly stopped in to hit the deli for lunch, and were not disappointed. I got the chicken torta sandwich on sourdough and my wife got a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of broccoli cheddar soup. My sandwich was awesome. Tons of pulled chicken and avocado, which offset the spiciness of the jalapeno peppers. I was also impressed with the broccoli cheddar soup. Way more broccoli than I had ever seen in a soup, but it was simple and packed a ton of flavor.  As for the rest of the store, they do have places to sit, but I would treat it more as a grab and go place for lunch. The inside is pretty bare bones, but it matches the atmosphere. If you have more time, they do have a bunch of local drafts on tap worth checking out. I also appreciated the volume of local products from coffee to beer and most everything in-between. My only gripe is that Rhino Market is on the other side of town from where I work, making it difficult for me to go for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food for both vegetarians And meat eaters. Prices are great.  The back ground music is nice. Yeah also the coffee is right on. Almond, soy and mike are provided for free. No extra cost."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a deli sandwich and beer. Cool vibe and laid back. Great local color."}
{"text":"Traveling and looking for something fresh and healthy. My roasted mushrooms and roots bowl hit the spot. Veggies were fresh and crisp. Maine Root sodas were nice for something different, though their root beer is nothing to write home about. Vibe is hip and bright."}
{"text":"This place is new, but if the past two days are any indication, it's going to soon become one of my favorites. The staff is super friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the overall atmosphere is very welcoming. It's the perfect addition to the up-and-coming Wesley Heights neighborhood."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the BEST homemade soup in Charlotte, look no further. The soup choices change on a daily basis, and if you discover that they're offering your favorite you better order it early on before it sells out.  They are that good!!!! Some of my favorites include carrot ginger, sweet potato bisque, lentil curry, and my all-time fav is sweet potato pumpkin (please bring this one back soon!).  The local coffee, rotating draft beers, delicious sandwiches, and breakfast items (the french toast with homemade jam and warm maple syrup is two thumbs up!!) that are served daily make Rhino Market my favorite local spot in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"I am writing to share that I just had extremely negative experience at your location.  I arrived early to meet colleagues for lunch with my laptop in tow as usual. I actually arrived at about 11:11, or at least that was the time when I reached the back counter to order food. I attempted to order a breakfast sandwich and I was told that breakfast was over. So, I decided to sit and wait on my three lunch companions to arrive and order with them.  I arrived early and to do work prior to their arrival to make sure to snag a table for four people since there are only three tables inside that seat four people.    I settled in and then had some women who works there asked me if I could move so that people who were there for lunch could get a seat.  She said that she was asking everyone on a computer to move to a single seat.  I then explained that I  had three people meeting me.  She then asked is they were meeting me for lunch 3 times and I answered \"yes\".  Let me be clear that it was like was asking a child and not the customer.  She asked to the point that it was accusatory and uncomfortable. Then, as I thought I made myself clear she said \"ma'am\" again as if I needed to move and I sad I have three people meeting me here for lunch. And she said again \"for lunch?\".  It's then that I decided to text everyone and go to a restaurant where I don't have to stake out table and then be harassed to move.  I have now spent hundreds of dollars on lunch, dinner, coffee, wine, and beer.  I shared with people how great the location is. I have told them to meet me there for lunch, dinner, coffee, wine, and beer.  It's a disappointment and disgrace to be treated with such disrespect.  It's unfortunate that money doesn't buy one respect."}
{"text":"Love the style of this place. They're like a fancy local bodega. They have sandwiches, salads, and all kinds of drinks and snacks. They had great service and the food was yummy. Parking could be difficult but it's a very walkable area."}
{"text":"Stopped in the new Rhino Deli on the Westside tonight (Thurs) to grab a quick bite before heading home from a late one at work. Ordered a Chicken Torta ($7.95) that is so noteworthy that I had to come write a review while I'm still eating it.   Juicy chicken. Toasted ciabatta. Melted cheese. Fresh sliced avocado. Jalape√±os for a delightful kick. Lettuce, tomato and a lil mayo. Carefully assembled, wrapped in butcher paper by a cute cook in the back, and served warm! I fully intended to take a picture but it smelled so delicious....  It's a hearty sandwich (I'm filling up but can't stop eatingggggg) so that makes me okay with the price tag. I also grabbed a beer (22 oz cider, $5.99) from the fridge. They have a decent beer selection that will hopefully continue to grow but it's a bit overpriced (minus 1 star). Good wine selection too.    Although I grabbed my food to go, there was a pretty good crowd hanging out inside tonight (it's a small spot, especially when cold weather nixes the patio space). The tables in the front and the small bar in the back were full of happy, chatty, people. Add in some music and you have a fun place that makes you feel more hipster than you probably are :)  My favorite part of this spot (aside from this chicken torta...have I mentioned how simple, yet amazing it is?) is the old school candy you can buy at the check out counter. Nostalgia for days.   Go check them out. Get the chicken torta. You won't regret it. Gotta go now as I savor these last few bites..."}
{"text":"This is a place that can do no wrong. The sandwiches are always the best. My go to is the breakfast burrito or the Rueben. Love the wide range of fresh sides or a assortment of chips to go with your sandwich. Then the selection of beer and wine will make you feel like your in heaven. 2 locations just makes it that much sweeter."}
{"text":"Rhino market is the ultimate go to for hard to find beverages and some great food!  First the drink selection is huge and a great variance. A good place to try something new and different. My favorite part about this place is the deli! The Sicilian, the Rueben, the corned beef...I could go on forever. Everything is made to order and you can taste the freshness.  They have a cooler where you can pick up things like freshly made tuna salad, cucumber salad and my favorite tomato and mozzarella salad! Their breakfast is also good, the breakfast wrap with jalape√±os is my favorite and very filling!"}
{"text":"I'm local to Rhino, so I'm also biased. Always tasty beer on tap, always a great beer selection on the shelf, and always top rated, hard to find beers to try out. The Ten Gift beer/sandwich special is great, and the chicken torta is tasty as can be. A great spot for a stop on the Greenway while headed towards town from FreeMoreWest, and a nice spot to catch a band or DJ. If you're nearby, stop in, grab a beer, and tell Rob hello!"}
{"text":"Great market and deli. It's a great place to just hang out with a beer too. Has a funky vibe, especially in the evenings. Love all the sandwiches and great breakfast options too. My favorite is probably the Hot Roast Beef with the Sicilian a close second!"}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place!!!The Chaud Legumes sandwich is incredibly flavorful with lots of veggies in it.   My friends really enjoy the Reuben too.   Vast selection of beer, wines and chips to choose from.   The store is open late however I have been there at night and noticed the kitchen was closed... I think it was 9pm. Call ahead to make sure it's open if you're looking for hot food"}
{"text":"Eclectic little pop of coolness in CLT'S trending West side.  Unique eats and brews including a tidy counter of bitters and other nearly impossible to find mixers (this ain't your local HT mixer section).  Nice coffees and breakfast sandwiches prepared to order.    Should they continue to grow I'd like to see a barrista added and a greater selection of grub.  For now, they're doing just fine.  PS:  the store is impeccably clean and neat.   I like the attention to detail."}
{"text":"Chaud Legumes is to die for. Cute atmosphere and I enjoyed joking around with the cashier. Very down to earth place to sit back, grab a bite and have a beer with friends"}
{"text":"Man I love this place and I love that it adds so much value to the Uptown area and lunch scene. There is nothing like Rhino Market and Deli in Uptown Charlotte unless you count Dean and Deluca which doesn't count 'cause it's a chain and it is just completely different.  if you haven't stopped in this wonderful place yet, please do. You can pick up some ground coffee from a local coffee roaster, a bottle of wine and some cheese for your after work dinner party and a damn good sandwich for lunch all in a day. They have fun gift ideas, plenty of local options and even a local beer map for purchase. All the while the best feel good music of every decade is playing. Today I heard some good ol 2000s R&b with Aaliyah throwbacks. In regards to the food, The ingredients are always fresh, the bread perfectly toasted, and the veggies bursting with color and flavor. The meat isn't too bad either, they definitely provide a healthy portion! I I cannot really compare how incredibly efficient the whole order counter, pay counter and then pick up counter are. The employees are all in sync and by the time you go to pay, you head to the pick up counter and your food is already rather quickly.  Again, please stop in if you want all all around good lunch experience and not simply just lunch."}
{"text":"Great spot. Laid back, great selections and specials. Friendly staff.  Plenty of seating of you want to eat there. And a great beer selection too, with a bunch of local craft options to choose from."}
{"text":"I along with a couple of other colleagues stumbled on this gem by accident, as we were looking for a bite to eat while at training.  This is a cool deli! The food is fresh and delicious and the staff is friendly.   The vibe is relaxing; this is a place you eat and hang out.  Sandwiches can be ordered hot or cold.  They have a variety of homemade desserts you can choose from.  I've had the chocolate chip cookies and the double chocolate cookies and they were scrumptious!  There is seating indoors and outdoors, and a variety of snacks & drinks.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Rhino Market is situated in Wesley Heights right behind Burger Co.  It is a great addition to this area, and if I still lived across the street they would have to name it Michael's Market.  This would be due to me drawing against my 401k to pay my tab every night.  It is comparable to Common Market without all the quirky toys/gifts you can buy.  Their sandwiches are top notch especially the sicilian. Add in great beers on tap and  a more diverse beer to go section and there you have it, Rhino Market."}
{"text":"I've been to Rhino a few times now. I dont live within walking distance so I usually go with a friend that lives nearby or when I'm just near there for another reason.  I do always grab a sandwich. They have a list of vegetarian and a list for meat sandwiches. On the latest visit, I got the club. It's nice. Not a double decker of anything so it's just enough food. Could have used another strip of bacon though. One half didn't seem to have any.  They have a fridge there with sides like slaw and broccoli salad. They have soup. They also offer quite an array of special sodas in cans and bottles as well as lotsa beer and even wine. Some cold, some not.  While waiting for my to-go order, I browsed. I dig that they offer bitters, syrups and vermouth. I was pleasantly surprised to see a bottle of real orgeat (French) so snatched that up for my at home bar.  Also, great patio in the side. Just watch out for the parking lot as some patrons seem to make their own spots making it a bit hard to navigate."}
{"text":"I gotta say that this is my favorite deli on the west side of Charlotte. Casual atmosphere, laid back, an awesome covered patio. The people that work here are just as awesome.   I fell in love with the Ruben and the Pure Intentions coffee is the best in Charlotte.  Lots of beer and wine here too if that's your thing.  Keep up the good work fellas! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great market with lots of beer and wine selections, snacks, and a counter to order sandwiches from.  Multiple fridges filled with beers, drinks, wine - They also have some beers on tap. I usually make my own sandwich - typically something like a chicken club.  They can press it and make it warm and toasty - my favorite type of sandwich :)  . There's an outdoor patio area to sit at if you want to bring your pup.  They have water bowls for them too."}
{"text":"Great place for beer (whether on tap or to go) but don't overlook the deli. Great sandwiches for carnivores and herbivores, alike. Even this carnivore likes the veggie options here."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend here for lunch during the week. This Deli part is very vegetarian friendly. The line you place your order goes pretty quick so you gotta know what you want and not take forever to overthink the menu. I went with the Tofu You. I would definitely order it again. It's simple and packs a lot flavor that you savor. Not too damaging to the wallet. Service is friendly and a little rushed, but during lunch it's expected. There is seating outside, great if the weather permits."}
{"text":"I've only been once, but A+ for convenience for people living in third ward and holy moly the Chad Legumes.... the sandwich of all sandwiches... the sultan of swat, the kind of crash, the colossus of clout!  More to come... I'm hoping they get some live music in there.  They've got a ton of space!"}
{"text":"Great deli atmosphere. Food is awesome, fresh produce on sandwiches. They have a great assortment of wine and beer. There is a great patio for outside socializing and there is a place for the kids to play. This is a great neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Unlike a couple other well-known, local \"marketdelis\", there is plenty of room to walk around, has excellent indoor and outdoor seating options, and is CLEAN! RM&D doesn't smell like b.o. ashtray drowning in last year's beer, nor is it overflowing with unemployed slackers from the local bicycle frat who always manage to shell out mad loot for high-grav Belgian ales.  Excellent deli, friendly staff, sweet selection of beers and sodas."}
{"text":"The Uptown Rhino Market & Deli delivers on all fronts. Grab a breakfast burrito, one of my favorites in town, and a cup of coffee for less than $8. Go for lunch and trade in the burrito for any sandwich and a beer. Enjoy the vibe, peruse the aisles of beers and snacks, read a newspaper, do some work. Just chill and enjoy."}
{"text":"Love the salads and the Sicilian from the place. Great selection of drinks you won't find at a 711 but quirky than a dean & delucas which makes this and anytime looking like anything place. They do trivia here too...overall super cute neighborhood market w a good deli and excellent selection of beers and wines :) love stopping in when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Came in here searching for the cold brew that is bottled by Not Just Coffee and was super impressed. Obviously we have been hearing a lot of people compare it to Common Market and while there were similarities there were also differences. They have a wider variety menu for one thing. My husband and I had a breakfast english muffin with soysage and egg and it was delicious. They have a seating area inside but also a nice little patio outside that would be great for the warmer months. We will def. be coming back to try some lunch soon."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop and grab a microbrew six pack or a sandwich. My first time I got a breakfast burrito and it was filling and tasty. About 8 seat yourself tables were plenty at 9am on a Monday. Rocking out to 80s jams over the PA and it's a good morning."}
{"text":"Two words. Chaud Legumes. It's hands down one of my favorite lunch sandwiches in the CLT.   The ciabatta it's served in is super soft and delicious. The caramelized veggies (zucchini, peppers, onions) are cooked to perfect. And the mozzarella is oh my!!!   I've compared this sandwich to the fan fav, the chicken torta, and they don't even compare. Although the torta is still very good.   So long story short: even if you're a meat lover you gotta try the Chaud Legumes. I promise you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with my wife. The staff is as friendly as possible and the sandwiches were custom made and outstanding. Great selection of food, drinks, snacks, wine and beer. Will def be back."}
{"text":"A common market style deli grocery store that has beer and wine on tap. Has the basic necessaries available and a decent beer collection in bottles. I haven't had the chance to try the deli but the food looks good. They have a few vegetarian options available but vegans may be out of luck.   If you're in the neighborhood and want a beer and a quick sand which, this place is great. But I'm not sure if I'd make the trip for it considering the model for this place, common market, is so close by."}
{"text":"Rhino Market is a great option to relax, grab a fabulous and unique beer or glass of wine and a bite to eat.  It's a hybrid bottle shop, snack shop, bar and take-out restaurant with a few seats inside and an outdoor patio.   The food is fresh and tasty - deli type offerings like salads, sandwiches and soups.  The folks behind the bar are super-knowledgeable and welcoming.  The bar offers pints and a selection of wines by the glass."}
{"text":"Some of the best French toast I've ever had! I love how we sat down at the counter and the owner talked with us for several minutes about the business and about our lives. Great experience."}
{"text":"Imagine your local convenient store but once you walk inside you're afraid you'll be spending a lot more time there than expected! Rhino Market and Deli offers a lot more than initially expected. You'll find a kitchen inside serving up salads and sandwiches (some of the best I've tasted in a while!) Plus a small bar with beer on draft or feel free to grab something from the cooler to drink. A large patio was home to the \"work from home crowd\" crowd --did I mention they also serve up all your coffee favorites?!-- groups of friends, dates and the casual new comer.   The Sicilian sandwich was delicious as was the Big Wheel, reasonable prices and lots of meats on both. I liked the vibe, I liked the food, I loved the large patio and overall got the sense that Rhino is a spot where you can make friends with the staff and return many times.  Update: upon second visit to Rhino Market & Deli, we tried the Stacked High and added pickles (you must add pickles!) This is officially my new favorite. We went with the cold Sicilian again which didn't compare with the Stacked High this time. Really my only qualm, and this is after eating many an Italian sandwich, is that prosciutto isn't sliced thin enough. Not sure the average sandwich eater would notice. But otherwise, really nothing to terrible to complain about."}
{"text":"Still love the chaud legumes (best sandwich in Charlotte?), but now they have a bbq tofu sandwich that satisfies our tofu need. So the wife and i normally do halfsies and everyone is happy. Pickled veggies don't usually appeal to me, but they go perfectly with the bbq. Always something you'll want on tap, this week the 1809 berliner weisse was delicious!"}
{"text":"fantastic deli menu, variety of drinnks & beer selection; wine. along with chips, cookies, jerky, and other misc eatery items nice local spot"}
{"text":"What's not to love about the Rhino! It is the go-to place for beer, wine, excellent food, friendly faces, and great service! It's easy to pop in and out of the place if you need to pick-up something quick or a casual place to park for awhile and enjoy the music, vibe, trivia, or live entertainment. The kitchen crew is top notch. The two talented and friendly women that usually work and welcome you to the kitchen are simply amazing. The food is always fresh and flavorful. The homemade vegetable, chicken noodle, and clam chowder soups are made to perfection and perfectly seasoned. I love my Mom dearly, but these soups are better than what my sweet Mom can make. Sorry Mom ;-)  I have yet to order anything disappointing from the kitchen. These guys are 100. Check out the Rhino and the kitchen talent! Enjoy..."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, healthy choices and positive energy. I love how friendly everyone is. The desert and side dishes are a little expensive at lunch time. The daily specials are must try options."}
{"text":"Seriously could not continue to reach this vegetarian goal of mine if it were not for the chaud legumes sammy. It's delish and I can't not order it when I go in even though the whole menu looks tasty.  This place is super cool ta boot. Don't be thrown off by the burger joint over shadowing it on morehead. I love this little place!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Craft beer great coffee and amazing breakfast burrito. This market has a larg verity of craft beers and wine with a deli in the back."}
{"text":"Often imitated, never duplicated. Although this is the first \"imitation\", had all the same amazingness of the original from the great craft beer selection to the deli menu and awesome, friendly staff. Eric, the night manager, introduced himself to my wife and I within five minutes of us entering.   Can't wait to see the evolution of the new store. Congrats to Ron and the team!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have lived in the neighborhood for close to a year and between the two of us, we probably go to Rhino eight times a week. The Reuben is delicious, but the Hot Sicilian is to die for. Ten Fiddy Mondays are the best value in the neighborhood with a sandwich and a craft draft beer for $10.50. The breakfast menu is still evolving, but their coffee selection never disappoints. Cannot recommend enough."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly. They're the neighbor whose door you'd knock on to ask for sugar.. and they'd actually go look"}
{"text":"After my first time here I was sold. The staff as a whole was very friendly - I was greeted by everyone working in the establishment . They have a great beer selection to choose from whether it be from their bar or retail area.   The highlight of my visit to this market had to be the Chicken Torta from their deli. I was expecting good but received great. Seating is limited on the inside but they have a nice covered patio that provides more space."}
{"text":"Love this place. The sandwiches from the deli are awesome - and I've tried most of them. The beer selection is great, including the rotating drafts at the bar. The staff is super cool - everyone's always willing to chat you up. The place isn't huge, but there's indoor and outdoor seating. They've always got cool music going - and sometimes live bands. Oh and the trivia is fun. Can't say enough good things about the Rhino."}
{"text":"So I never knew Rhinos's was at this location.  I've always passed it on my way to work or out to lunch nearby.  I finally got to Rhino's on a recommendation from a friend.  Let's just say there will be a weekly stop here for breakfast!  I had the steel cut oats with brown sugar, cinnamon, and pecans and a bacon and egg sandwich with veggies.  Everything was very tasty and owners/employees were very friendly.  They also make Mimosas!  No complaints here!"}
{"text":"I too love the concept here!  I have no idea how I've walked by this place for over 3 years and never gave it a chance... shame on me!  Great spot for lunch workdays or weekends.  Great sandwiches and a plethora of snacks will not leave you short on choices.  To compliment their food items, their beer selection is incredible and features my favorite beer Delirium, which is pretty hard to find most days.  I got the Wednesday French Dip special and was not disappointed.  Real sirloin steak, great bread and Swiss made this a very satisfying and well portioned lunch entree.  Will return!  Food:  7.5/10 Features:  9/10 Value:  8/10 Inside:9/10. Like the layout but a little small."}
{"text":"Tried to go there this evening about 10:55 pm after the Charlotte Knights game for a beer, the door clearly says they are open until midnight, as well as their social media accounts but we were turned away and told they close at 11. If that's the case then change it on your door and on your social media accounts."}
{"text":"Breakfast. Omg. The Breakfast.   The coffee is good, the breakfast sandwiches are ermagherd good, and the staff is super friendly.   They have a handful of craft beers on tap, and a ton of six packs to take home. The vibe is hip, and fun - you can hang out and sip coffee or beer, or take things to go. Whatever works best for you. The coffee is awesome-sauce - It has perfect descriptions and smells so stinking good. And there are two sizes of coffee, basically medium and large. For some reason, I just really like this. They get me. And honestly, there is not a day when just a small coffee is going to do it, come on people - be honest. They have wifi and I've sat in here to do a little bit of work before hitting Uptown for work - I love the friendly, chill atmosphere.   The deli is in the back; decide what you want, order then pay and hang out until they call your number. I highly suggest the english muffin with egg whites - but if you get there after 11am, then its lunch time. So get the spinach salad with goat cheese. I know what you're thinking, \"Kel, that's healthy and it has nuts in it, yick.\" But don't fret, Grasshopper. Even the nuts taste good in this salad combo, and the bacon will help to balance it. Order it. DELICIOUS.   It was initially really hard for me to find the parking lot - I don't know why I kept missing the turn in driveway, but turn right after the burger place, it's tucked behind there with the gravel lot. There are a few random spaces up front, but I usually park in the gravel just to stay out of everyone's way.   I've only stopped here on my way to work, so this is a \"morning scene\" review. I'll update you when I hang out here one evening."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place on a regular basis ... bring folks there... ( $$$$) have meetings there ...sometimes I'd be there daily ...but no more ...food is still good and there are some folks that work there that are really fantastic ( some of the great employees have left as well so the shift is even more prevalent ) so if you do decide to go fine ...this review is based on customer service atmosphere and my and my friends experiences ...so instead of writing a novel I'll break it down simply:  1. An employee ( a friend of the owner ) was disrespectful to me , other regulars and the staff on several occasions . When it came to me personally the other employees apologized for what he did ( not even going to relay what it was because it still makes me mad )  because they knew me and when he finally came back after the staff said hey you messed up he got mad when I was talking to him ... so he still thought he was right. This also goes with my number 2 and 3 . No repercussions ( friend of the owner )  2. An employee advised I could get a beer because the taps were closing soon ( mind you I had a few friends with me and one was there from incident 1 listed. So another employee when going to the bar walks up to me in my personal space ( like way too close ) and said taps are closed . Which wouldn't had been an issue but they way it was done ( the disrespectful pseudo intimidation  ) which I laughed off because he really didn't want to go there... and it was silly ..my friends were like ... \" you know him ? \" I stated no my first time seeing him ..are they teaching the new staff to be terrible ?   3. The owner had a dispute with one of the vendors and called him a black mutherf*****  in the store ( the vendor was not there ) some of those staff members were ethnic and they heard it of course ...while I heard he apologized later .... anyone who is comfortable enough to do that has said and done much worse about staff , customers etc in private. And the tolerance for bad behavior.  There are other issues some told to me and I've experienced but the last 3 really sealed the deal. They benefitted from common market closing uptown and failed to understand what made that place great. Oh and too cheap fir heaters outside... ( thought I'd throw that in too )   I wish well to the good folks that still work there but I will not ,unless there are mitigating circumstances ,support this business."}
{"text":"Great soup and grilled cheese sandwiches!  Love having the option to go in and all the draft beers are switched out so you can try a lot of different beers on draft at the bar or sit outside on the picnic tables.  Great selection!"}
{"text":"Overall, Rhino Market is Common Market 2.0  Less hipsterish. Cleaner. A slightly older crowd. But pretty much the same concept.  The chicken torta was good but the roast beef was better. Enjoyed a glass of wine and a beer with the sandwiches.   I wasn't blown away by anything at Rhino Market but I'd try it again."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! It's great for coming to chill and grab a refreshing drink and just sit, talk, and enjoy the vibes. The bartenders are friendly and help to just keep the environment relaxed.  There's lots of really great and (TASTY) different beer options from local breweries.  They have a couple little grocery sections, and indoor and outdoor seating. There's a great little cafe in the back too! Beer and yums for the win! There's also little bar books and games to interact with at the bar - super fun! This is my husband and i's favorite new place to come and chill!"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiches and locally roasted coffee is the best thing to happen to Uptown and my morning in a long time. Everything you need to start off your day with a smile. Did I mention the coffee is amazing! All local, rotating daily and with none of the coffee shop pomp."}
{"text":"Awesome little place, they have beer on tap and it looks like a baby common market. It's a great little deli if you're not around the south end area."}
{"text":"Vegetable soup is amazing!  Highly recommend.  It is a great cheap lunch.  Service is good and order comes out very fast.  Especially good if you want something hearty and quick."}
{"text":"If I could have given this place a ZERO, I would have.  My daughter and I walked around this place for 20 minutes and not one employee spoke to us.  I live next door at the Catalyst.  I go to leave and we are chased down the street by an employee who thought we had taken their glass.  Lady, you were the bartender and cashier and you never spoke to us.  How would we have gotten your glass?  There is no level of customer service in this place!  It is a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is stellar, the food quality I would put at 4 stars. I feel it's a bit overpriced for the food you're getting. Never had any bad service"}
{"text":"Stopped by Rhino Market with some colleagues for lunch and was very impressed! The line moved quickly, my chicken salad sandwich was delicious and the staff were friendly and seemed to be enjoying their jobs. I was also surprised by how reasonable it was - my sandwich with chips and a la croix was barely $10. Amazing beer selection, will have to go back!"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE sandwiches. Try their Torta. I'm a torta snob but I like their different take on it. Knocked down a star because their beer is expensive in relation to similar bottle shops.   I still feel like F√ºd at Salud is better (same concept) but when I want to switch it up, I'll go here. F√ºd has cheaper beer and a really interesting sandwich line up.   Both places do spicy really well which is hard to find in Charlotte. I usually order \"extra spicy\" everywhere but these guys aren't shy about their sauces."}
{"text":"Great ownership, product, and store.  The food is quick and the owner has a particularly good attention to detail.  Looking forward going back."}
{"text":"We are in town for the Panthers game and looking for breakfast...this place is awesome! I had a cold turkey sandwich with avocado and my hubby had an avocado BLT. The food was fresh and tasty. Quick and friendly service. The best part is all the wine and beer selection...we could have walked around looking for hours...inventory was endless. We plan to visit again and again!"}
{"text":"Rhino is certainly a treat for uptown Charlotte!!! I'm from Philadelphia and a true sandwich snob  This is, by far the BEST spot I've found to drool over a well constructed, almost too big to take a bite, good to the last morsel concoction. There's a wise selection of staples on the hot and cold side. The topping selection is on point and it always fresh. Did I mention they also have AWESOME breakfast options?!  I don't live in the area, but work up down so is is always a drive. With the news they're opening a new spot right on Church Street (across from Mellow Mushroom) I'll now be right across the street!! Whether you visit this location or wait until the new one opens, you should not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We've been here for breakfast and lunch and both times, the food was great.  They even had live music.  They have a wide variety of items for sandwiches and salads, or you can create your own!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about Rhino for quite some time now.  The rave reviews are totally legit! Why, oh, why did I wait so long?  Reminded me a bit of the Common Market, but with a bright, airy feel to it.  The deli here is fantastic! The beer selection is impressive as well! Even a few on tap! Grab a cold one from the fridge, ask for a glass and drink it here if you want!  The math is simple - Burial Ceremonial IPA + Mango Tango Foxtrot IPA + Zapps Salt and Vinegar chips = heaven... It's like an IPA sandwich with potato filling...  The Stacked Corned Beef sandwich on rye is a game changer! Sooo freakin' good!  Selections for carnivores and herbivores alike - salads - deli sides - weekday lunch specials and even breakfast served daily!  Go to their website, download their menu and staple it to your forehead so you don't lose it!! Or just fold it up and cram it in your wallet...."}
{"text":"I enjoyed finding a location where one can buy a beer and or wine to enjoy without it being over priced andor stuffy. I wish the patio was larger than it is. Aparently they will have a pop up sushi offering in the weeks to follow. I didn't taste their currently selection of soups or sandwiches but from other guests talking amongst themselves, they seem to have enjoyed what they had."}
{"text":"Everything here is de-freaking-licious. My go-to sandwich is a hot Sicilian and it never lets me down. Great beer/wine options, good seating, friendly workers!"}
{"text":"Common Market'ish.  The benefit for me to having this place open is that it is closer to my house and it feels like there is more room overall.    Great selection of food for lunch, dinner or whatever as well as a pretty stout beer and wine selection to browse through.  It's a no frills kind of interior but that's just fine for me.  The outdoor area looks prime for an outdoor patio hangout once the weather turns.  Parking can get a little crowded here but never impossible."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The egg salad sandwich is delicious. And the torta subbed with tofu is nothing less than amazing. Parking is a bitch, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Very cute local market. Quick, easy, convenient, and cool atmosphere. Able to stop into the market, grab a beer or wine, and then order a sandwich. Nice little outside patio to sit on, very casual and dogs welcome."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic. Sweet potato and black bean salad was awesome. Asian kale salad was great. And hot roast beef really good. Plus they have Mickeys Fine Malt Liquor!"}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch and found it to be a really neat place! I ordered the Sicilian hot sandwich which was absolutely delicious. The ciabatta bread was to die for. I wish I could make my own because it was phenomenal. My wife ordered the chicken torta which was also on the ciabatta. The chicken was very well cooked and seasoned and the avocado was just the icing on the cake. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So nice I ate there twice. In a row. And I'm already having withdrawals.  This place serves up sandwiches large enough for, well, a rhino. No need for a side item. They source their bread from Local Loaf, which in my opinion, make the sandwiches. Grab the Chicken Torta for your first try. It's incredible!  Service is well paced and friendly. I can see this place easily sliding into a Charlotte staple. So glad someone is stepping up to the plate and filling the affordable, local lunch spots we desperately need. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the 'hood. Coffee good, so is lunch and snack selection. Need to spend time on craft beers and wines since I have not yet..."}
{"text":"During my first visit to Rhino Market, I ordered the Chicken Torta on ciabatta with avocado, tomato, provolone and pulled chicken. It was very good and I am sure I will order it again. My friend ordered a sandwich and specifically asked for no mayonnaise which then came with a large amount of mayonnaise! We were two of just a handful of guests at the time - not sure how that happened. Rhino is somewhat like the Common Market but without the fun \"funky-ness\" of the CM (you can decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing.) They offer wine by the glass, some beer on tap. They have a large selection of beer and wine on shelf and in coolers. Live music is featured on occasion which is a big plus for me. I'll go back."}
{"text":"The feel of the place is fantastic and I can't say anything bad about the food either. Both the breakfast and lunch are great. The staff is top notch as well. My only real complaint is that while draft beer prices are fair, packaged beer is pricier here than any other similar store in Charlotte. I'm not paying $15 for a four pack of cans that are $11 or $12 right down the street."}
{"text":"Deli hours are too unreliable. I've headed there too many times and they are closed well within their normal deli hours."}
{"text":"Best Reuben sandwich I've ever had!  My son had the club and it looked super fresh and delicious also!"}
{"text":"I adore this place and they are perfect! Get the French toast! It's amazing. The coffee selection is wonderful and they always have good beer on tap. If you're looking to grab a quick 6 pack or bottle of wine, they've got you covered too. Food wise, I also highly recommend the breakfast burrito, the chicken torta sandwich and the rhino salad."}
{"text":"This is a groovy joint. I say groovy because I'm writing this review as I sit at the RM bar listening to 60s R&B. I have my laptop on WiFi and plugged in to the super convenient/considerate power outlet (the bar has several) as I enjoy a breakfast burrito and cup of coffee. Groovy seems like an appropriate descriptor.   I'm a neighbor of the original Morehead location so Rhino's concept was not new to me. You have the same delicious food, wide selection of beverages, and inviting atmosphere. What's great about the uptown location is that it's a nice change of pace to the usual uptown rest stops. Uptown has plenty of coffee shops, delis, bars, and convenient stores. But Rhino is the only place the combines them in to one (and does it well).   If you are in for breakfast, try the burrito! For lunch, the tofu you sandwich! Have a coffee, have a beer, have a coke, or whatever. You can't go wrong, there really is something for everyone here."}
{"text":"Rhino Market is a cute little joint in the Wesley Heights neighborhood, where I just so happen to live. As such, this has become a favorite hang out spot. From a quick lunch, to a glass of wine, to finalizing a midterm paper: Rhino Market has got my back. They have a decent deli plus pre-maid snacks galore, a small bar with wine & beer options, and free Wi-Fi.   The service is, more often than not, nice. The vibe is very casual, and the staff are quick to give recommendations if you're having a hard time deciding on what to eat or drink. I've had a few experiences that were... awkward... but nothing too bad and, hey, we all have our off days.  The market itself is located in a shared building, at the intersection of Morehead and Freedom. The parking lot can be crazy at times but there's plenty of spaces and, in the event that there are no vacant spots, there's always the option to street park. Inside, it feels pretty spacious but the seating is a bit limited. They do have a patio which recently got it's very own partial awning; this is nice, since it sits directly in the sun most of the day.  All in all, Rhino Market is a very endearing piece of Wesley Heights."}
{"text":"This place is a great balance of grocery store and deli. There's an order counter in the back with made from scratch breakfast items, sandwiches, and salads. Both Vegan and regular options. Pay on front and also order drinks and pay anything else up front at register.  Staff is super helpful and friendly.  Local coffee offered with all the variety in fixings  for it. There is indoors and out seating to eat or take items to go. Wi-Fi is free. Can get wine, snacks, and some specialty items here as well."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My local go to for craft beer, wine, a quick sandwich and outside patio.  Great people who work there and a cute, quaint atmosphere.  I would like to see them carry more grocery essentials but space is limited. Love Rhino!"}
{"text":"Rhino has a distinct hipster feel, craft beer on draft, an excellent deli with high quality sandwiches and breakfast McMuffins, and a small grocer with an excellent selection of wine and beer and prepared foods.  Black Mountain Dynamite coffee, my fave, on the shelves too..."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS I came here for lunch on Monday and I cant say that I was all that impressed. I understand the whole concept -- and I enjoy it very much. Just like a lot of people said: it has that common market-ish feel to the place. The sandwich I had was just ok. It wasn't \"out of this world, good\"....but it wasn't \"I wont eat here again, awful\". Know what I mean?   I like that they have a some local beers on tap and they do have a pretty big selection of beer. However, I don't think I'll ever purchase bottle or canned beer here unless they have something that I can't find anywhere else since they do overprice there beers so much. You'll save 20-30% if you can find it an Harris Teeter. $10.99 for Shiner Holiday Cheer when Harris Teeter carries it for $7.99, cmon brooo? Like Heather M. says, \"insanely high prices on random things\" while other prices are reasonable. Remember those small Frito bags your mom would pack in your lunch? Like the Tiny bags? Those are $1.49... yeah =/  Deli: When it comes to word Deli, I take it very seriously. I expect to see cold cuts, all different types of salads, spreads, hot dishes, etc. The deli here is kind of a walkup counter. You place your order, then they kind of disappear into the back and call your # when its ready. Maybe I'm just expecting a NY type deli and those probably don't exist down here.   My experience on Monday: I ordered a Sicilian sandwich with NO TOMATO. The guy asked if I wanted it hot or cold. I took a second to respond since I was putting some thought into it and he quickly said \"we recommend it cold\".  So that's what I got - Sicilian w/ no tomato, cold. I get back to my office and go to eat my lunch and I realized that they made my sandwich HOT and there was TOMATO on it. So I picked the tomatoes out of it and ate it. The sandwich was decent, but I much rather had it cold and my bread not be all soggy from the tomato that turned to mush. Listen, mistakes are bound to happen every now and then...I'm not here to bash anyone. I just expect that when I order something for the order to be right.  They are conveniently located near my office and I'm sure I will eat here again since our options in the area are pinkys, picante, burger co...etc. Hopefully, my first experience here was just a fluke and they'll get my orders right in the future."}
{"text":"Stopped by Monday evening for a quick bite after walking the doggies in nearby Irwin creek walk way. Ordered the Chicken torta, roast beef, & half herb chicken (to go). The ordering window was fast. My only small grievance is that can we at least get a side of chips or even just pickle with our sandwich, lol?   I've had the chicken torta before and it's a generous size sandwich for the price. Nice soft ciabatta bread with juicy chicken breast, jalape√±os, avocado, tomato, and mayo. Can't really go wrong.   The market itself has a wide variety of organic and non organic beers, wines, coffees, cookies, & other snacks. Their bathroom is also unisex which is a test to the current HB2 law debacle going on in NC right now. #wearenotthis  Sat out on the patio with an organic strawberry beer and even participated in their trivia night for a bit. They had other board games & even a doggie water bowl for our babes (she didn't drink out of it). Overall a chill & cool place to grab a quick bite!"}
{"text":"This maybe my next chill spot. Atmosphere is similar to Common Market. The staff was very friendly. I was told they have a DJ on Tuesday night's and trivia on Monday night. Food was great, I tried the Portabella sandwich. Very flavorful."}
{"text":"Still enjoy Rhino Market. However, it would be great if they extended breakfast hours on the weekend... I literally just left without a purchase because \"breakfast ends at 12p and it was 12:08p. Seems like lost revenue to me!"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars. This place is pretty cool. You have a large selection for lunch, though I asked if they had any half/half combos (half sandwich and soup or salad) and they don't. Only potential suggestions. Me and my colleague had a cup of soup (plenty!) and shared a sandwich. Our soups:  butternut squash (tasty but very very sweet) and broccoli cheese (very good). Sandwich was the chicken salad which was good. The vibe is awesome with the music. Choices were abundant. Seating limited so it was good we went well before noon."}
{"text":"Just had the best chicken torta I have ever had outside of South Texas. The ambiance is great and the bar has a wonderful selection of local beers as well. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I ordered the pastrami, I should've just gotten a turkey sandwich but I figured out real quick that I absolutely hate the taste of pumpernickel bread, so I just ended up throwing half the sandwich away."}
{"text":"Market/bar and amazing sandwich shop all in one. If your looking for different fun snacks this place has the most random chips/candy/Fresh bakes goods....etc!  Good beer on the draft lines or you can get a cold one out of the cooler. I tried an alcoholic root beer- so much better than \"Not your Fathers\".  You order food in the back- hubby had the club huge and filling & I had the pulled chicken Torta wrap. You can edit and add to any sand which or customize.  We had 2 adult beverages, 2 very large sandwiches & 2 bags of chips for - $30. My sandwich was so big I had to bring half home. Will definitely be back. Oh, also a great spot for people watching if you sit by the window.  Only complaint was wish the menu was bigger and more variety."}
{"text":"My husband and I are just steps away from Rhino Market, which automatically earns it major brownie points from us. Besides it's close vicinity, though, Rhino is just plain awesome for a quick bite, beer, and/or wine run.   We decided to grab sandwiches before heading up to the Panthers game last night. My husband had the hot Sicilian and I had the chicken salad sandwich - so much YUM. The sandwiches came out in about 5 minutes, ingredients were fresh, and were filled to the brim with meat and veggie goodness.   I also really appreciate the huge selection of  unique side items - everything from tomato and mozz salad, broccoli salad, and fresh fruit, to a whole aisle of chips, ranging from traditional brands to options for our healthier cravings, like kale chips. I went with a kettle chip salt and vinegar option, boasting 30% less fat than other chips... totally healthy, right? Right.   We took our sandwiches to go, but what really put the cherry on top of our experience was spotting a six pack of Great Lakes Christmas Ale, hubby's holiday fav. That obviously came home with us, too.   As always, thanks, Rhino - we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I went to Rhino Deli last week for the first time.  I eat lunch out every day and I like to try new places. This one had been highly rated on Yelp so I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the piled high sandwich with corned beef.  The rye bread was an average (nothing special) and definitely not what I expected for $8. To my disappointment, most of the corned beef was very chewy and I could not eat it.  I hate to give locally owned restaurants bad reviews. However, I hope this feedback will help them improve. If you want to charge $8 for a sandwich with nothing on it but meat with no sides, you had better serve the best ingredients!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come and socialize and drink and eat. The deli is fantastic and the beer and wine selection seems to be growing! Great place"}
{"text":"Finally found a NY style deli in this city that works! Incredible selection, atmosphere, and the foods are incredible!!! Amazing wine/beer selection, tons of organic treats and the sandwhiches are the best I've had in a long time share mine for a deli like the NY delis I grew up with close to home back in NYC. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great place in uptown. Nice spot to grab a quick healthy breakfast to get your day started. I had the La Mode(Spell Check lol) breakfast sandwich that came on sourdough bread, spinach, egg, tomato and light cheese. I also got the steel cut oats with fruit. Really good stuff...I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great stop for deli sandwiches and salads. Can dine in on their intimate outdoor patio and have a glass of wine or beer or take your food/booze to go. Seating available inside as well should the smokers outside annoy you. Snacks available for purchase as well like chips, pretzel chips, popcorn, candy, etc. I had the chicken salad which was good, but a little too big of chicken chunks -- was hard to work through. My boyfriend had the baked potato soup which was great and paired it with a club sandwich. Great little stop for a quick lunch or a grab and go!"}
{"text":"We visited the market on Friday.  We ordered sandwiches and eat outside in the patio.  I'm all about kid friendly places, and this place nailed it! They have a little kids table with sand for the kids to play with, they have bubbles that we also enjoyed, and a people size jenga!   Ok about the food...   I order the spinach salad with goat cheese and bacon.  Delicious and the amount of cheese was just perfect. Lol.  They are not selfish with the bacon either. :)   My husband had a salami sandwich? I'm not a fan but he loved it.   We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Nice people.  Unreal beear selection.  Both locations are great plenty of parking original location."}
{"text":"This was really cool.  The staff is young, fun and knowledgeable.  Lots and lots and lots of beers including a small bar with stuff on tap.  Interesting items...Kind of like Common Market, but clean and fresh, open and accessible.    I was only in the neighborhood visiting a friend, so I probably wouldn't go regularly, but I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for breakfast last Saturday. Great bacon egg and cheese sandwiches! Awesome atmosphere and wonderful coffee selection."}
{"text":"I bumped into this place while working at a construction site near by. If you are ever near the Bank of America stadium area, the Rhino is a must! I always get the breakfast burrito & it is simply the best one I've ever had. They have a simple yet diverse breakfast & lunch menu. Everything is so fresh & delicious! There is also a small store that has an awesome selection of craft beer & wine. I haven't tried the coffee but it definitely smells wonderful!  They always have really good music playing & the atmosphere is right up my alley. The staff is very friendly. I can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"So cool little short order kitchen with amazing coffee and tons of beers draft, specialty and everything in between.  Really great Reuben sandwich, decent scrambled sausage and cheese tortilla.....really nice staff and super industrial styled layout."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Rhino Market & Deli to continue my adventure around Charlotte to find the best reuben, and I was surprised to find the reuben was served with pastrami even though they also had corned beef on the menu. With two of us on the adventure it made sense to get two different reubens and split them - one Rhino style with pastrami and creole mustard and one classic with corned beef and russian. Sadly, I wasn't a fan of either one.¬†  Starting with the typical Rhino reuben, the proportions were just off. Although the pastrami was delicious, there was barely any on the sandwich. Most of the bites I had were primarily kraut and mustard - my two least favorite parts of a reuben (or modified reuben, most reubens don't have mustard). The couple bites that had OK proportions were good, but I was pretty unhappy with the overall reuben. Plus, the bread was horribly soggy which is yet another unpleasant experience with a reuben.  On to the modified (traditional) reuben. It was basically the same as above except loaded with corned beef - no idea why one sandwich had 3 times the meat as the other. The bread was again soggy, but at least with russian mixed in the flavors worked out OK. Unlike the pastrami, the corned beef was just your average typical deli meat and nothing special (maybe that's why they serve it with pastrami).  Although Rhino Market is a fun spot to hang out, I'd recommend avoiding the reuben based on my experience."}
{"text":"Me and my SO flew into Charlotte from California on a red eye and needed food and coffee that would revive us from our journey. This place really did the trick.  We got a very large coffee - which tasted great. The beans were quality. We also ordered breakfast, me la mode and my SO the English muffin. Mine was great! The eggs were cooked perfectly, with just a smudge of runny yolk to flavor the bread and mix with the cheese. The spinach was flavorful and added a hearty taste. My SO was very happy with his sandwich and we spent the rest of our morning wondering why we can't find these kinds of breakfast sandwiches where we are.   The selection of beers, wine was impressive and the staff very nice! Glad we made an effort to get away from the airport and get a real taste of local Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This is 3.5 stars for me, rounding up to 4.  The concept of rhino market is really appealing!  They have a variety of beverages, serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  They play fun music and have eclectic products.  The food Is ok, nothing special, and a little overpriced.  The chicken torta is the best sandwich, but for me it's too much bread and not enough ingredients.    It's in a convenient location which is a plus.  The staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"The Rhino is very reminiscent of the Common Market, only not nearly as tiny. Nice grill at the back where you can pick up some bites (make sure you place your order first, so you can then shop), and lots of interesting stuff in the aisles to keep you entertained otherwise - assuming you did place your order first you can look for something while you wait, or if you are not hungry, you can peruse and find something that you like instead.  Once you are set, there are a couple of smallish tables inside or a couple outside as well. The selection is tough to beat, and the food is solid too, though make sure you realize that it's not a full fledged restaurant here before you go in.  And make sure you pull up the picture, it's tough to be somewhere that has Mike D as their profile pic. It's got to be good."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. I love that they have so many local items! I ordered the Italian sub and got a bag of chips and black cherry soda. Cashier was friendly and complimented my nails and necklace! We were lucky enough to get a booth. Sub was delicious! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I know Common Market SouthEnd is closing next month and I'm looking for a new spot in the area.  Knowing this, I had to find a substitution. Run by the same guys as Common Market, Rhino Market and Deli is nearly a carbon copy of the CM vibe. Good selection of wine, beer, and non alcoholic beverages (hello Blenheim's Hot Ginger Ale!). They have daily sandwich specials and on Wednesday it is a French Dip - a sandwich that I have an obsession with. Lucky for me, I decided to try this place on a Wednesday I got it to go and when i had my first bite at my desk at the office, I pretty much decided I will be going to the Rhino every Wednesday to get this delicious treat. Shaved beef, Havarti cheese, Rosemary bun, and some delicious au jus. French Dip perfection.   I love the quirky atmosphere, odd trinkets, snacks, wine, and beer that is offered. Plus hard to find mixers,  bitters, sauces, seasonings, and of the beaten path non-alcoholic beverages.  This will definitively be my new place when Common Market closes next month. Basically the same thing with a different name. Just wish there were more soup selections like at CM. Denver Green Chili? It's better at CM than it is in Denverv IMHO. Hopefully they pass that recipe along to the Rhino. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"So glad this is walking distance from the office. I went for breakfast, 730 am and there were a couple of people in there but I felt like I beat the rush. So if you want made to order food you order at the window on the right at the middle aisle. You then pay back at the bar and add some coffee (lots of choices) and then pick up your food with your paid receipt at the other window towards the back right of the store. I always worry about the procedural aspects of these markets but this worked smoothly. I ordered the sausage breakfast burrito which was the perfect size. Substantial but not huge. Next time I'd try it without the salsa just because I don't want that little bit of sweetness it provides but it was good either way."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of Beer and Wine/ creative sandwiches with lots of Vegetarian options! Snacks and treats galore. Great patio and outdoor seating as well!"}
{"text":"I used to work a block away from here for nine years. I can tell you right now that the Rhino is something this neighborhood desperately needed.   When you walk in, your first thought will be hmmmm this looks like Common Market. No, you're not crazy. A former CM'er is behind this place. It feels bigger than both CMs. I don't know if it actually is, or if it's just because of the more open layout. It doesn't feel as cramped.  You'll find a great selection of wine and beer here. Specialty product type stuff. They've also got some great brews on tap and good coffee. (Watch out Dunkin Donuts across the street in the weird, former tattoo place)  Hungry? Hit the deli in the back. You order there and pay at the register. They'll yell when it's ready. There are a lot of options... including a good amount of vegetarian selections. I like the house vegetable soup. Last visit I got a bowl of that and the Sicilian. I ended up taking home half the sandwich (I was so full) and having it the day for lunch. They also have a breakfast menu.  There's a nice little patio outside. The parking is pretty ample, but the lot is kind of awkward. There a few tables inside to eat or sit down to do some work.   My only real complaint is that this place didn't open a few years ago when I worked at WBTV. Although, my wallet is probably happy about that."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Had a delicious bacon egg and cheese sandwich on an English muffin with a cup of great coffee. My only complaint is that it's not on Tryon Street, it's around the corner on church street but it was worth the walk around the block."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the deli's in Philly, but a lot more open, clean and upscale. So nothing like Philly, haha. Besides being not so inconspicuously followed around the store. I was very impressed. Reuben with corned beef is tasty, and buttery.  I almost ate my girlfriend's chicken salad wrap too, that good. Selection of beer and wine took me the most time, like a mini frugal mcdougal. Might be a frequent stop for me!"}
{"text":"Had a yummy toasted Chicken Torta sandwich for lunch today.  Staff was super friendly and the owners stopped by my table to chat and make sure everything tasted great.  Looks like they have a nice bottled beer and wine selection as well as a small bar with some beers on tap.  Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast burrito in Charlotte!  Can't go wrong with their other sandwich and breakfast options either.  Love their rotating draught beers and their selection of bottled and canned beverages!  They have a great selection of local items and snacks.  Great place to stop before a road trip!"}
{"text":"I had a? Sicilian? cold and a beer. The ciabatta bread was incredibly? fresh and the sandwich? was piled high with meat. I almost didn't want to finish the second half so I could enjoy it later. It's a very well oiled machine and they do a great job handling the rush for lunch. While we were there they cycled through at least 90 orders in about 20-30 minutes.   Very pleasant? staff as well and the guy eating the almond butter with a spoon in between cashing people out was a good talking point!    Great place for a quick lunch stop. My only suggestion would be to put chips on both sides of the aisles so if you forget to grab a bag you don't? have to fight through the line to grab some. However, it is a mistake you would only make the first time you go."}
{"text":"Totally love this place!! Food is great. Beer and wine selection is great..Everyone working there was awesome as well...except for one lady that took my money was bitchy and had a horrible personality, but I'm not gonna let her ruin my experience. Maybe I just caught her on a bad day. I've been a few times now and I will definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"Rhino has an awesome selection of beers I'd never heard of. I'm learning to be a beer nerd here with the rotating selection of unique beers they have on draft. They'll also let you try anything they have on tap there. I've tried several of the sandwiches there and they're great - straightforward just good ass sandwiches. Theres a nice covered outdoor area. Sometimes I've been in and there's a band or dj or open mic. Its always a good spot for conversation or for posting up with a laptop and getting some work done. Staff is always friendly. And they sell zapps chips and you know zapps are the best. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte for the Half Marathon and as I was walking to the Expo from my hotel, I had my eyes out for a place where I could pick up a quick, healthy lunch, preferably a sandwich. I saw this place as I was walking and based on the reviews, it was Yelp approved.   I've never been to a place like this before (supermarket and deli combo) so walking in I was kind of confused. I saw seating so I was like \"Do I just sit down? Will someone come to get my order if I do?\" But then I saw other people forming a line towards the back and as I peeked my head in that direction, I saw a small window for orders. I stood in that line and reviewed the menu as I waited. I ordered the turkey sandwich on whole grain which consisted of turkey, cucumber, lettuce, tomato and Dijon vinaigrette. After I ordered, they handed me a hand written receipt and told me to pay up front. It didn't make sense at first. Why couldn't I just pay right there? But I quickly understood that the concept was to give customers the option to buy other items within the market and pay as one total up at the front registers. Ok got it! I did grab a bag of BBQ Lays on my way to the register.   Right after I had paid, I went back to the pickup window and my order was announced within a quick few minutes. After I picked up I looked around to see if there was any open seating. There wasn't and even if there had been, I was once again confused. No one had asked me if this was to-go or takeout. I didn't know if I was allowed to sit in there or if that was for customers who specifically stated that they wanted to eat it there? Again, confusing setup.   So anyways I took my sandwich and chips and threw them in my backpack figuring I'd find a public area to eat. Luckily for me, it worked out well. Less than a block away there was a very pretty seating area outside of the Wells Fargo building. It's right by a pretty water fountain and there are many open tables, mostly filled with downtown (or uptown as it's called in Charlotte) coworkers eating lunch together on a Friday afternoon. I really enjoyed dining there!   As for the sandwich, it was pretty average. Nothing you can't make at home, but it was what I was looking for. Overall, just a tiny step above Subway. I'd recommend this as a decent place to grab a bite to eat with coworkers if you work nearby. Other than that, meeeh. Average meal and semi-confusing setup warrants a 3 rating from me."}
{"text":"Full disclosure-we were headed the Pinky's and it was packed so we looked across the street and spied. Rhino's.   BIG DRAW: live jazz combo playing!!!  Walked to the storefront, through multiple wine/beer/snack offerings, and ordered at the back.   Tons of vegetarian and gluten free offerings as well as typical deli food; Rubens, salads, and soups.   Tables in front of store as well as outside seating. Easy parking lot access, casual cool/hip vibe, brought food out to you.   Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm a little late on this review, sorry. I read the raving reviews so I tried it. The sandwich was good and the wait wasn't long during lunch time. The people were friendly and the place was packed. They have options to choose from in regards to chips, salads, sandwiches and drinks. I will return if in the area but I won't go out my way just to visit."}
{"text":"Loved the menu selection and food was quite tasty. Loved that I could select gist cheese for my sandwich. On a hot day there are limited seating options. Felt the price was a little steep considering portion size/lack of sides. Staff was quite friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Rude staff.  Came in for lunch with my friend and his two daughters (ages 10 and 8).  Daughters were walking around and the staff member (who is new) told us that we would have leave if daughters were not seated.  It's a store!!!  This is not the first negative experience we've had with this employee.  We've been coming to the Rhino for years, but we are done."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday right before noon and there was a decent crowd, but not busy.  There were breakfast and lunch sandwich options.  The store area was neat and organized, very clean.  I like how there are so many different things to look at: snacks, drinks, drink mixes.  There are sweet snack and savory snacks as well such as beef jerky, vegetarian jerky, and other options.  The staff was helpful and friendly, since it was my first visit here.  They showed me where to order and pay.  I look forward to stopping in on an evening and trying thr bar area or perhaps the outside."}
{"text":"My breakfast burrito was AMAZING and the lady was so cute when she was checking me out lol"}
{"text":"Same great rhino market, just another wonderful location! Delicious sandwiches, cold beer and good music. You honestly can't go wrong with any of their food choices- breakfast or lunch - as it's all incredibly fantastic. They also have vegetarian options so it's a win win for everyone. Really excited for their new spot and know anyone that works uptown should check it out!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to uptown! Exactly what we needed near the office. The breakfast burritos are so filling that I don't need lunch after one! I've yet to have a sandwich for lunch that I don't like. Have people coming over after work? Grab a bottle of wine and some snacks on your lunch break and you are sorted for the evening. Don't forget to check out the daily sandwich specials!"}
{"text":"So glad to have this deli in the neighborhood!  Their simple sandwiches are fantastic as a good sandwich is hard to find!   I recommend the Sicilian and the club!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Rhino Market & Deli. Rhino Market is a great pit stop for eclectic beers or a bottle of wine on the run but also provides seating both inside (limited) and outside (dog's welcome) for you to have a seat and enjoy your beverage. In addition to drinks, there are snacks including chips, jerky, local bread from Duke's (I highly recommend the sourdough), and the best ice cream sandwiches you will ever taste (Nye's Cream Sandwiches, get the strawberry shortcake). Don't forget the Deli which serves sandwiches for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They have a great selection of both meaty and vegetarian sandwiches. My go to order is the Chaud Legumes, it will make a vegetable lover out of the biggest meat lover, with its many grilled veggies, mozzarella, and garlic aioli to top it off, you will not be disappointed.   There is always something going on, whether it is Monday night trivia or live music Saturdays. Do not miss out on this local gem!"}
{"text":"I love having this place across the street from work. I can eat breakfast, lunch and dinner here. They also have an excellent selection of coffee and beer. Prices are also very good. Try the Le Monde for breakfast sometime - its my Go-To!"}
{"text":"Love this place, but it's become impossible to go here for lunch due to a serious parking shortage. They share the property with Burger & Company, Picante, and a couple of other small shops and the parking is totally inadequate. I'm just not going to cruise that dusty parking lot until something opens up. This has happened the last few times I've tried to go here for lunch. Really too bad."}
{"text":"I love checking out all new delis around charlotte and came across this place. Found it similar to the common market who's sandwiches I love and based off the reviews I said ah what the heck. I got the build your own sandwich which was $6.99 and babe got the rhino club. Added two bags of a chips and a corona which all came up to $26.00 sheesh! The sandwiches weren't good to us. Not very flavorful and the type of bread I had was just to much. The service was outstanding I will give them that. The place was packed and the options of chips were pretty cool. My chips were better than my sandwich. I'll stick to common or laurel market. I'll definitely be back to sit and enjoy a glass of wine or cold brew. Oh yeah they also have a bar that you can sit down and order drinks. A more older crowd but very laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"This one has been on my list for a while.   As this was my first time there, the ordering processing was a little confusing.  Once we got that figured out though it was great.  I had the Chicken Torta and it was delicious.  We opted to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the Carolina weather.  They have great beer and wine options (even though I did not have any in this trip) I will be back to enjoy a bottle of wine and good eats with friends on the patio soon."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place that reminds me of a good old fashion New York deli because honestly it is nothing like that but the food is delicious. I was a vegetarian when I started coming here but still as a carnivore can't seem to stop eating that tofu sandwich. Delicious! I'll step out of the box here and there but I always find my way back to that tofu!!! && th beer selection is on point. Ow I almost forgot they sell my favorite pretzels in the world. I'm not going to tell you the name just know that if you find them be ready to never crave another pretzel again. You're welcome"}
{"text":"Rhino Market is fantastic. I find myself going there at least once or twice during my work week. As someone who is more of a Plaza/NoDa person rather than uptown, I find Rhino Market to be a blessing for my uptown work location. It has that funky home feeling that I look for in a place to hangout. Their beer selection is great and they always get the special releases! The made-to-order food and the snack sections are also pretty bomb. Lots of food options, for sure! But if I had to name the thing that brings me back to most, it's the staff. They are always friendly and helpful. I've been going there on and off on my lunch breaks since they opened and within the first month, they already knew me by name. It's the little things like that that always bring be back. Thanks Rhino fam, you guys are the best!"}
{"text":"Perfection. The cruise crew is always welcoming, full of laughter, great music, and he torta is unstoppable. I always get mine with the whole wheat wrap! They'll love you like family. A must if you're in need of a cold beer, champagne, or a fine red. Regulars call: Get. The. Blondie."}
{"text":"The Sicilian sub is delicious. I was looking for a small non-chain sub shop and this was the perfect find. Such a cute market with plenty of options for drinks and sides too. Very friendly staff. Can't wait to go back and try more of the sandwiches"}
{"text":"I love the concept of Rhino Market. They have a great beer selection, fresh made sandwiches, and grocery items. We hosted a happy hour there and everyone seemed to be happy with the beer.   I was a little disappointed with the sandwiches we got. We got a french dip and made our own with bacon, prosciutto, and goat cheese. The one we made ourself was pretty good, but the french dip was so dry it was almost inedible. We got them without the bread so I'm not sure if that's what made it dry, but even using the au jus didn't help.   Overall, I really like this place and will probably be back. I'd like to give their food a second chance."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out because I had heard nothing but good things.  Just stopped in today to pick up lunch and brink back to work.  I got the Char Legumes sandwich (which smelled delicious) but by time I got back to I was sad to have nothing but a absolute soggy mess of a sandwich.   The ciabatta bread was soaked and the sandwich was piled high with nothing but extremely over oily veggies.  Would never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Definitely a go-to for me in Charlotte! I love this place. I describe it as a smaller, cleaner, better Common Market.   They are sitting on some seriously good beer kegs. I walked in and was shocked at the beers they are hiding over here. I also love you can drink anything you buy on site, so there are a TON of options. They have cheap wine by the glass as well and mimosas!   The deli is also excellent. A lot of good vegetarian options. My favorite sandwiches so far are the Chaud legumes and the pimento cheese sandwich, add bacon. I have also enjoyed the Reuben. The le monde for breakfast on sourdough is excellent! (Add avocado).   This is just a great hangout spot. The long hours are perfect as well. I would swing by on my way to work for coffee and breakfast, and I would swing by on my way home for beer. Keep it up Rhino. There's a reason you see me every week."}
{"text":"Such a cool deli and in a wonderful location! They have a great and healthy selection of cold salads, regular deli items and wine and beer. We picked up cold sesame noodle salad and lentil salad which was delicious! Great place for a quick pick me up!"}
{"text":"I am in love really. The staff is SO friendly. The environment is welcoming and eclectic. It is clean, and the choices are bountiful. Chips, beverages, wines, and beers galore. Of course fun quirky items scattered about.   Now let's talk about the food. SOOOOO GOOD and FRESH! The bread for the sandwiches are delicious and the freshest of any sandwich shop I've been to in Charlotte. The choices for vegan/vegetarian are many, and I chose the Tofu You. It was BBQ tofu, lettuce, onion, pickle, tomato and vegan mayo. It was INSANE. I've not enjoyed a sandwich this much since being a vegan. Thank you Rhino!!   I will come back as often as my diet will allow. A+!"}
{"text":"Mannn. Rhino is the coolest. A little smaller than common market (RIP, South End location...), Rhino serves all the same things you loved about common, but in a smaller footprint and more neighborhood feel. Delicious deli sandwiches and killer breakfast options? Check. A tap full of beers you've never heard of? They got it. Beer and wine sold by the bottle both cold and room temp? Duh. Live jazz and trivia during the week when the sun goes down? Why not! The Glass Animals pandora station playing? My dear sir, it's heresy to believe any other acoustic treat would be proclaimed from their speakers!  But ten fiddy Mondays, ya'll. $10.50 for dinner and a pint. You just can't beat that. My suggestion? Chicken Torta. But you won't be disappointed with anything you get. This place is really a gem for Wesley Heights, and I keep on coming back."}
{"text":"Never enough seating for people, but plenty of seating for beer and wine!!   Rhino Market is one of my go-to places in Charlotte where I always have a great experience.  The deli makes fresh food made to order within 10 minutes or less. There is certainly no shortage of alcoholic beverage options!!  This location gives off a very strong community vibe where they play trivia at night, on occasion they have live music inside while dining, and they always offer a smile with the service.    Rhino Market is a place that I hope never loses it momentum or community vibe.  I'm excited to move closer to the market very soon so I can be considered a local rather than just a regular!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time a few weeks back and have been back 3 times. I love the Chicken Torta so much I can't bring myself to order another sandwich, however I have had nibbles off of my boyfriends sandwiches and enjoyed them. I would suggest adding garlic Aioli and sriracha to the Torta... It takes it to another level!   I don't love the environment, but overall there is a decent beer, beverage, sandwich and snack selection. The house pasta salad is also very satisfying."}
{"text":"Great service,amazing food and cool selection of natural food.... Definitely a must return"}
{"text":"Me, my wife and daughter ate here yesterday for lunch. Wife had the Reuben, daughter had the the turkey club and I had the Sicilian. Fresh veggies on top of Boar's Head meat and cheese. There wasn't a crumb left between us. Yum. Highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"This place is the same concept as Common Market which the owner use to work at CM. This is a nice neighborhood market I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches and salads. Any beer you could imagine and wonderful wine selection. Wish there was a little more of a selection of staple groceries - milk, cheese, bread, eggs - things that you can't get without driving pretty far to a grocery store."}
{"text":"A great selection of beer in a atmosphere that is a cross between hipster and professional.  I had not been to the Rhino market for quite a while, but met someone for a coffee meeting.  I arrived early and got a nice bacon, egg, and cheese muffin and a cup of coffee.  A bit more than say a McDonald's meal, but it was made then and the coffee was craft brewed.  The seating area is limited since the bulk of the store is beer, wine, and snack aisles.  The mix of people is awesome: hipsters, suit and ties, dad and kids, business meetings around laptops, jogging pants, the stereotypical apple laptop writer in a beard and fedora, cops, you name it, this place has it all.  It's a nice blend of all people that shows that beer, coffee and food unite us all!  It's a nice spot to hang out, a live DJ comes out most nights, and the beer selection is very niche.  There are things there I have never seen, so if you are looking for a unique or hard to find brew, try them out!"}
{"text":"Cool, casual atmosphere. Good wine and beer selection and great original sandwiches  decently priced with an average around $7. The chicken on the chicken sandwiches is pulled from whole fresh chickens baked in house!"}
{"text":"The food is really good trying my first vegetarian sandwich today and am really happy with the quality of the food. Also the staff is welcoming and very friendly"}
{"text":"John and I have been pumped about the new Rhino ever since the announcement was made about a second location. Go figure, this location did not disappoint! When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by Eric. All the staff are so friendly and I love that they offer the same, trusty selection of beer, wine, and other beverages. I ordered the chili and it was had great flavor and was very meaty/hearty. This location's bar is bigger, which I liked. I also love that they maintain their eclectic wall coverings, which works for Rhino. If you haven't been here, check it out! I think the only downside is parking, but that's to be expected Uptown."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, \"What is not to love about Rhino Market and Deli?\" We'll start with the location - Rhino sits just west of Uptown on the awesome neighborhood of Wesley Heights. If you live in the neighborhood, you've been to Rhino because it's a one stop shop for some of your shopping needs. You can grab a sandwich, coffee, beer, wine, pre-made meals, and an assortment of other locally crafted food and beverages. With Wesley Heights being more \"up and coming,\" there aren't a ton of places to grab something quick. Rhino definitely fills that niche.  One thing I love about Rhino is the neighborly atmosphere. It's definitely a friendly spot to hang out, read a book, grab a bite to eat, grab a drink, play some trivia, listen to live music, and overall just sit and \"be.\" The staff are always fantastic - friendly, conversational, and fun are words I would use to describe the staff.   Let's talk menu for a minute -- I am a fan of the entire menu, but my favorites are the french toast (YUM -- local bread, real maple syrup -- did I say YUM already?), the ham sandwich, and the grilled cheese with soup. Rhino has amazing, fresh made soups. My favorites are the chicken and rice, chicken noodle, corn chowder (with bacon!), tomato, and broccoli cheddar. You really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  Beer and wine selection are outstanding! I love that Rhino serves a variety of local coffees brewed fresh. Rhino has ample parking and is a family-friendly environment. Sometimes, they have special events like Open Mic Night on Wednesday.  If you have not been to Rhino, add it to your Charlotte Bucket List NOW and go ASAP. You are really missing out on a gem. For all the other Rhino lovers out there, I'll see you around at Rhino."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, best menu of as many vegetarian things as meatatarian things. The rest of the store is foodie  heaven. I got a butterscotch root beer that tasted like the cross between birch beer and cream soda I didn't know I wanted. I had a BBQ tofu sandwich with pickled vegetables. I found both Voodoo spiced potato and the best Dill potato chips in existance (not too vinegar to ruin the roof of my mouth). SO much beer and wine selection. Gluten free options abound, the dessert options available, ice cream sandwich, King of Pop, gluten free tarts in the freezer. The thousand island my friend got was  homemade and reported delicious and I found Docs Draft Pumpkin hard cider. Win everywhere."}
{"text":"Great little spot for deli eats! They have a deli set up in the back w lots of vegetarian options (soy sausage!). The breakfast burrito was the best I've EVER had! Seriously we debated going 2 days in a row.   They offer several types of coffee and have an iced coffee option - all delicious and self serve.   They sell lots of snacks, as well as well-known and unique sodas.   They sell beer and wine too, and have a few drafts at the bar.   There's some tables inside but they also have a pretty patio out back to enjoy the weather. Huge parking lot makes parking easy."}
{"text":"I am so glad I finally came here! The staff is so nice! The cashier tipped me off on BYOB for tasting on the 1st Wendesday of every month which is a cool way to meet people and discover new brews. I will for sure come in for one of these and update my review accordingly.   We came here yesterday for lunch. We were surprized to find so many vegetarian options, nice! I ordered the chaud legumes while the bf ordered the chicken torta. It was fun to browse through all the wine, beer and goodies while waiting for our food to come out. I didn't expect the sandwich to be so big and so tasty! The bread was delicious and fresh, it had the perfect crunch on the outside and softness on the inside. The portobella mushrooms, peppers and caramelized onions do not make you miss meat, what a wonderful combination. Yeah, it is a little more expensive than the average Subway sandwhich but the freshness in component of Rhino Deli's sandwhiches really comes through.   We will definitely be back! Cheers!"}
{"text":"The best way I can describe this place is a lowkey Common Market. Anything from their deli is delicious. I usually get the Chicken Torta. Their soups are also delciious! They have a huge selection of snacks, wines, and beers. They also have a nice patio which is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Common Market, you're a fan of Rhino Market---TRUST ME! There is a great selection of bottled beers and wines along the cooler wall, but you can also get a draft beer at the counter. The aisles have options for chips, cookies and other random snacks/knick knacks. There is limited seating inside, but a great sized patio outdoor for eating, drinking and hanging out.   THE DELI *swoon* I could eat here every day. My favorite is the Raw Rhino on a wrap, but the Chicken Torta is delicious as well. There are plenty of options including multiple for those who are vegetarian, vegan or gluten free. I really cannot speak highly enough of the deli--the items are awesome.   The parking situation seems to be good--I've never had an issue and there are ample spaces."}
{"text":"So much to choose from! I made a quick stop in for lunch with my boyfriend and I was really impressed with the sandwiches we snagged from the window. Generous portions, fresh, and great tasting. We had a nice date in the park across the street. Do it."}
{"text":"Love this spot!  Quick, easy, comfortable. It's a great coffee spot, lunch stop and place to pick up some drinks on the way. Menu is simple and food comes out pretty quick, lots of snacks and sides available & if needed stop in to grab beer or wine. plus tons of parking available   Best tip about this place: not too many indoor tables available fyi"}
{"text":"Great place. Truly great wine selection for purchase to take home. Several very good deli items. Just salads and sandwiches--not a real restaurant. But a seriously cool place to hang out at large bar."}
{"text":"Great spot conveniently located on the way from the airport to downtown.  I've been here multiple times and they have excellent sandwiches - the Rueben is fantastic.  Very large selection of different types of drinks and snacks/chips.  My \"go to\" lunch spot in downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Charlotte. Hot chicken torta and hot Sicilian are my favs. Shhhhh .... Don't tell the hipsters before they flood this place and ruin the local hood charm. Also a great place for locally roasted coffee, breakfasts, craft beer, sake, and Oregon Pinot Noir."}
{"text":"this place is always solid. the food is delicious, well priced, and timely. the beer selection is phenominal, and most of all, it's funky fresh!"}
{"text":"Love the Chicken Torta and salad selection. Beware the overly priced avocado $2.49 for a couple slices of it."}
{"text":"Yeah absolute worst place I've ever eaten in the past 10 years you would do better eating at the circus!"}
{"text":"Rhino fills in such a great need for Uptown Charlotte: the local market and deli. It's such a great spot to grab a quick sandwich, stop in for bottle of wine to take home for dinner (from a surprisingly diverse bottled wine and beer selection), or cozy up to the bar and hang out for a while sampling their revolving selection of craft beers. For breakfast or brunch, I absolutely love the Le Monde (egg, sauteed spinach and tomato, melted havarti on rustic sourdough). For lunch, it's the Big Wheel (hot pastrami, swiss, creole mustard, sliced pickles, pumpernickel)."}
{"text":"Fan 4 sho'!  I have been running by the Rhino Market a lot these days and even went in during Biketoberfest as it was an active participant.  Recently did brunch with friends here and the french toast was AMAZING.  Limited tables inside, but large patio outside and ample parking for all!  Yes, part of the lot is gravel, just don't speed through like a JA and leave a dust cloud for everyone to choke on.  Order at the counter, with super nice staff.... pay at the register with the ticket order you are given.    If you walk in for the first time here, it can be sensory overload, but that is just a testament of all their offerings here.  Quick snack, actual sandwiches, there is something for everyone here.  There are really cool gift finds here you can stumble upon.  I mean, who doesn't want a mexican wrestler bottle opener?"}
{"text":"I've been here twice mostly to drink beer but I am quite impressed with this place.  It's like another locally owned convenience store but without the claustrophobia.  Rhino market is laid out well.  They have a place to order sandwiches and such in the back, a bar to partake beverages, anything you'd expect from a convenience store and seating up front. Along with that the staff is very friendly and helpful.  I love their beer selection and love, love, love their portabello sandwich. Probably one of my favorites in Charlotte.  For merchandise, they have a lot of craft beer and local food vendors represented.  It's a good place to hang out and there's plenty of parking right now...until a developer buys the parking lot."}
{"text":"I love this market!  Have enjoyed breakfast and lunch here.  The english muffin breakfast sandwich is fabulous!  A generous portion of egg, cheese, and your meat of choice.  Their lunch specials are just as good!  The atmosphere is casual, urban market.  Fun to shop the few aisles of unique food and beverage items!  A must go!  Plus, the owner is from Detroit!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. From the outside it doesn't look like much but this place is quite a gem.  If you get a chance order the spinach and bacon salad which also comes with cranberries and goat cheese. It is absolutely delicious.  The staff is friendly, and the service is quick, which makes it great for a quick bite for lunch.  They have a great selection of beer and wine and an eclectic mix of offerings which includes candy that made me nostalgic.  I just loved Big League Chew bubble gum growing up.  Seating does get limited during lunch, but during the warm season you can opt for the patio."}
{"text":"What a cool spot! If you looking for some limited release beers, good selection of wine or need a great deli meal, this is your spot! Had lunch here the other day and it was awesome! Fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have never been (and will probably never be) to a better market-deli in my life. My husband and I were just driving through Charlotte (from vacation in SC) and happened upon this amazing spot on Yelp! It has yummy sandwich and salad options for both meat and non-meat eaters. PLUS they also sell a huge selection of refreshing drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic). It's like a trendy, hipster, unique convenient store that totally deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"FreeMore needed a place like this. Hopefully this is the start of more places, restaurants, bars, stores coming to the area.   Beers on tap are good too. Indoor and outdoor seating.  Upgraded from 3 to a 4 star after ordering the french toast for breakfast.  Way to step up your game!"}
