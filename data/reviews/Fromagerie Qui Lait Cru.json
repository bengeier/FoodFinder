{"text":"I'd give this place no stars if I could. I went to the market yesterday and was quite excited to try their classic grilled cheese sandwich...however I never got the chance to. 

I stood in front of the place and kept trying to make eye contact with the food server to put in my order but he simply just ignored me and in fact another lady came and stood beside me and he took her order in french. I was pretty cheesed off by this but I thought maybe she was coming to pick up her order from the grill. Nope he was making her order for her on the spot. Another few minutes pass and another guy stands to my left and the server takes his order. By this point there was no mistaking the server was purposely not taking my order for whatever prejudice reason. Anyways this way of operating a business is WRONG and they need to do something about their attitude. I refuse to give my hard earned money to assholes!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I was looking specifically for raw milk cheese and they have several here. They let me try one and I loved it, it was such a complex flavor! It tasted like a chanterelle mushroom.  I also got a fresh goats milk cheese and an amazing brie. All the cheese I got was from Quebec. The staff was all very helpful and some of them were funny too. I speak very little french and they were quite willing to help me in English. I would go back here a lot of I lived in Montreal, I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"qui lait cru, where is your soul?  from your stark, overly minimal interior to your strange lighting, i felt like i was in a laboratory rather than a place to purchase something near and dear to my heart:  cheese!

i had no idea buying cheese was such a serious and somber affair until i came here.  in most cases i prize service and knowledge over friendliness or cheerfulness, and the staff were polite.  it just felt like there was something weird lingering in the air, and it wasn't the smell of cheese which, we've already established, i love.

my biggest problem with qui lait cru is that there aren't any prices on any of the cheeses, which would be fine if i felt like the staff were approachable enough to ask how much certain things were.  

i was happy with the disc of french chevre i purchased, so that's something.  not enough for a return visit though."}
{"text":"My go-to neighborhood cheese monger. I really like the vibe of this place, not pretentious, it's just about the cheese! They will help you find what you're looking for."}
{"text":"C'est un lieu magique pour les amoureux du fromage et des produits laitiers....
Vous trouverez tout autant de produits étrangers que de produits purement québécois...un vrai plaisir!
Et que dire du service qui est impeccable...les serveurs sont gentils, patients et très serviables!
Ils feront tout leur possible pour répondre à vos désirs et en prime vous feront goûter leurs merveilleux fromages!
Un petit coup de cur pour le Bellavitano framboise ( à la bière de framboise) ou encore celui au balsamique!"}
{"text":"Qui Lait Cru is French word play that incorporates 'raw milk' (lait cru) into an expression which translates as \"Who would have believed it?\" This bright, open cheese shop in Jean Talon Market specializes in those raw milk cheeses generally only available in Quebec and France. Raw milk aged less than 60 days is legal in Quebec, and carefully monitored. The taste is incredibly fresh and delicious. I have found the staff at Qui Lait Cru very helpful, bilingual and friendly in that chill Quebecois way that doesn't try to shine you on. Sometimes I just describe the mood-flavour I'm in and they hook me up (today it was an organic spreadable mild goat cream cheese that is working perfectly with my heirloom tomatoes and ground cherries - delicieux!) There is a daily sampler deal - 3 cheeses selected by the staff for 14$. This is generally a delicious value for the cheese-venturous, and the more senior staff here can even suggest wines to accompany the selections. I think the decor here is intentionally clean, bright and relatively minimal to avoid any thoughts of raw milk making one ill. Most of the cheeses are priced in kilograms, but don't hesitate to ask the staff to give you an idea of prices for your wedges before you buy - they will grab a little red tray for your cheese selections, weigh them out, and help you go all around the counters till you find what you need."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time when I was going to chill at Jarry park. I wanted a quick bite from marché Jean Talon. Their sandwiches caught my attention. I am glad I ordered from them. They have mostly vegetarian options and the quality of cheese, bread and other ingredients in the sandwich are very good."}
{"text":"I'm 62 years old which means I have had lunch more than 22,700 times. Today I had Le Flamme Nationale at Qui Lait Cru and it was the best lunch I've ever had!!  Three kinds of cheese, each with their own distinct flavour on Berbere bread, punctuated with walnuts, honey and Arugula. Black tortilla chips completed the plate. Every bite had a different texture, degree of oozing cheese and crunch of bread. I must have had good karma to merit finding this sandwich!!"}
{"text":"If you want to get unpasteurized goat cheese from Quebec or France at Marche Jean-Talon, Fromagerie Qui Lait Cru is the place to go.

The staffs are friendly, knowledgeable and patient.

Especially if you are not sure what you want? and even what you like? They able to help you to find out what you may like.... 

My Yelp Friend ended up picking 2 different cheese for us to try.....

a soft goat cheese from Quebec and a hard goat cheese from France

Both are quite mellow, great if you are not into strong flavoured cheese! Kudo to the staff for his recommendations!"}
{"text":"I tried to get service of this place. I'm not sure why the attendant ignored me standing in front of him. I wanted to enjoy the market and grab a bite. After being deliberately ignored (I.e. Serving 3 customers before me that arrived after me) I left. Discrimination may be the case, I'm not sure if it's cause I'm a minority or not local. Surely, I'm not a person who wishes ill on others but I hope this place goes out of business. 

I do not recommend this place and avoid it. To support discrimination does not bold well with my meal."}
