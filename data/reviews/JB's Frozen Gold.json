{"text":"What a great concept and fun to watch!  The best in Wxw so far.  Can't wait to try their NEW BBQ coming in July"}
{"text":"I asked if they had a gluten free options they said yes and went o. To describe how it worked then another girl came out and asked the other employees if that was true. It wasn't.  Two disappointed customers. Very uninformed"}
{"text":"After visiting JB's on Thursday night and having the best service ever and the best ice cream I have ever had. I was excited to return again while still in town visiting family. Unfortunately, we decided to return Saturday night. The service was subpar, the three teenage girls behind the counter were rude and they were arguing with each other. We ordered the same flavors, this time they where under flavored and not nearly as good as the time before. The girls behind the counter also touched their hair multiple times while preparing the food. Yuck.  So sad that the this place is hit or miss. If you decide to go, go Thursday. Hopefully the same girl will be working and you will get amazing ice cream. Avoid Saturday night unless you are okay with flavorless ice cream, rude workers who play with their hair while preparing your food."}
{"text":"Truly creamy and delicious ice cream, made to order! This Friday evening there was a great crowd cheerfully waiting their turns for the custom creation. I had vanilla with Heath bar. There now are four great places for ice cream in Waxhaw."}
{"text":"This place is great for kids and adults alike because the process of watching liquid nitrogen turn liquid cream to ice cream is a process everyone can enjoy! Every single special and classic ice cream flavor is made on the spot right in front of your eyes--it doesn't get much fresher than that, honestly. Their ice cream making process results in creamy, fresh flavor packed selections that you can put in a cup or a cone (both provide a lot of ice cream for the amount you are paying). I recommend their strawberry cheesecake flavor, which has fresh strawberries and chunks of cheesecake mixed in. Such a cool concept and an unbeatable taste!"}
{"text":"The nitrogen used to freeze the cream is a sight to see.  The m&ms came out ultra frozen and the portions were very adequate.   Its a bit of a slower process as each order is made of course in its own metal bowl but its worth the wait."}
{"text":"What a cool place !!! They freeze the ice cream right in front of you with nitrogen! The kids loved it and I thought it was awesome also.  Every flavor we all got tasted great."}
{"text":"This ice cream is THE best ice cream over the other creameries in the area. My husband and father in law love it and they are ice cream snobs. Cool to watch and takes a little extra time but so worth it."}
