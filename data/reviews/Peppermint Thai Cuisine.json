{"text":"Neither the food, nor the service is what it used to be.  Tried red curry, which was not close to what I had tasted. It was so bland, that I asked for some spicy sauce. Surprisingly they even charged us 50 cents for red sauce. The waitress was quite rude. The sticky rice  was half cooked ! Not sure if the cook or the management changed. The bubble tea tasted like the Oreo milk shake. People in Cleveland should really get their taste buds checked. This restaurant is not worth 4/5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, especially the appetizers.  I had the garlic shrimp and wish there would have been more sauce.  It wasn't what I was expecting as instead of accompanying veggies there was wilted lettuce.  But that said the shrimp were good.  Where I was really disappointed was the service.  The server clearly didn't like that we had 6 people with separate bills (each on business), told us there would be a 20% service charge - fine - but was unwelcoming and slow the rest of the evening.  He seemed to be much more integrated into other tables with presumably regulars.  He really ruined the experience for me and I will not be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I am so glad that this place is close to my new job.  Absolutely love their Country Style Pad Thai.  The fried rice and spring rolls are also great choices."}
{"text":"Peppermint offers well-prepared, slightly upscale, Americanized Thai food that blends seamlessly into its location in a Pepper Pike shopping center. There's no dark meat in the chicken dishes to freak out the more delicate souls among us, and the service is swift and pleasant. I found the food overly sweet, but there were still some nice flavors, and there was no overdone or otherwise poorly cooked seafood (a BIG pet peeve of mine)."}
{"text":"My husband and I are here from Toronto visiting family. They took us to Peppermint for dinner last night.  I rarely take the time to write about our experience at a restaurant, but this had to be the WORST Thai food we have ever eaten! In Toronto there are Thai restaurants literally on every block( as well as Vietnamese, Korean, Sushi), so we eat Thai food often. Maybe there aren't many Thai restaurants in Cleveland? At least that would explain why other yelpers may think this is good Thai food when it was absolutely awful.  It totally lacked flavor! Both of us asked for lime and hot sauce to try and \"fix\"our dishes, but it didn't really help. Even the lemongrass soup was lacking in any kind of lemongrass taste- again we both tried to add flavor to it but to no avail.  My sweet and sour chicken dish was literally swimming in liquid red sauce, totally watered down - no taste.  Our cousins who are mid-70's seemed excited by their Pad Thai because apparently they never ate it before? Seriously?? Cleveland is not a small town, surely there is better ethnic food around than this.  Ps: had to send back my Coke(!) as it was watery and tasteless too! Waiter acknowledged that maybe they had to change the cartridge. Shameful."}
{"text":"I like this place.... tasty food, quick service, really clean, efficient. Awesome Thai Iced Tea... Have been there multiple times already."}
{"text":"I'm not a fanboy of Cleveland's restaurant scene. Too much undeserved hype. There are definitely some good restaurants here, but the majority are eh to uggh. Why start my review with so much hate? To put my praise for Peppermint Thai in perspective.   The flavors are clean, the food is clean, the place is clean. You walk in and just feel good. I've been here many times, and it never disappoints. It's not ambitious food, but its just so darned solid, tasty, and a good value to boot.  If there were only another 19 places this good in town I'd be set."}
{"text":"I stopped in while in town on business one evening...only about half full.  The staff were very attentive and friendly.  I ventured out of my norm and tried several new dishes...all of which were very tasty and I am a big Thai food fan."}
{"text":"I love the food in this place...the siam rolls are my favourite...the basil fried rice is pretty good too.."}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently.   Very friendly and effiicient service.  Good food with  large portions.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for Thai food."}
{"text":"Peppermint Thai has the best Pad Thai around. Every time I go It is difficult to order anything else because the dish is so good! The Tom Kha Gai Soup is great for those who like coconut and the curries are also delicious, especially the Panang Curry. This restaurant is great for any occasion and offers friendly and really fast service. Whether we order out or sit in, the food is always prepared really fast, but always with great care and quality. Another great option is for those who like spice you have the option to add more, while those who do not can get a milder version of any dish. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for fast service and great food."}
{"text":"It has been a few months since I got take out from here, and I just had the Masaman curry.  A-OK is a perfect description for it.  The restaurant changed which veggies go in this curry, which I obviously should have checked before ordering, but I was still disappointed.  The sauce was really thin and it didn't have the flavor it used to have.  Plus I was mysteriously charged an extra $1, which I don't understand.  Anyway, the experience didn't make me super excited to order from here any time soon."}
{"text":"Not family friendly. The owner gave us grief when we brought our stroller in and asked for us to leave it when there was plenty of room in the restaurant as it had just opened up and there were no customers. We would have been more than happy to leave it outside or at the front of the restaurant if it was a small restaurant or blocking anyone, but this was not the case. We were the ONLY ONES at the restaurant."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite thai restaurant in Cleveland. Been here a couple times now and truly enjoyed each time. starting with apps, special mention of the steamed shumai (delish!) and chicken satay. There are several entrees that are worth acknowledgment, but hands down, my favorite is mango curry and the thai style basil - just amazing. I'm not a fan of the desert here, but everything else is awesome. Service is quick, prices are very fair. Restaurant is bustling and very clean."}
{"text":"I've only been there once but would go back. The service was good and attentive. The food was good. Pricing was appropriate. I'm closer to Mint though so I'll be back there."}
{"text":"their pad see ew is quite nice as opposed to bangkok thai who use tagliatelle for pad see ew. the noodles are succulent, flat, thick. the sauce is well seasoned. the chicken/coconut soup is to die for. it is the classic sour/coconut/sweet flavor that we crave in thai food."}
{"text":"Our kids and us love this place.The service is good and the food delicious. Come with an appetite..."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. I'm obsessed. Everything I've tried on the menu is delicious. My favorite dishes are the scallops and eggplant(their eggplant is the best I've ever had) and lardnar noodles. I think they have wine deals on a certain day of the week as well. The servers here are adorable quiet Thai girls who are all super polite. One of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"The panang gai and pad thai are as thoughtfully prepared and fresh as any I have eaten in Los Angeles or Bangkok."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was awesome. The Mango curry was flavorful and super tasty.  The wait staff was very attentive and extremely nice and polite. It was also the fastest meal I ever had...in and out in less than 20 min!!"}
{"text":"Excellent is not good enough to describe this restaurant!!!  Would give more than 5 stars if I could!!   Pad Thai was delicious as was Tom Yum soup!   Service was attentive and friendly.   Attractive, very clean and inviting...   I will return"}
{"text":"Don't know much about Thai food, but the food here is good . I try the green curry with chicken which was very good and alot better than Pai Thai in Hudson."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Cleveland area and we've had them all.  Awesome."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant thought I fell there are better local options. The food was somewhat bland and the curries all seem to taste very similar. Duck I tried was not well prepared. Service was good. Parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"After having had thai food in 21 of the continuous states, and 6 other countries including Thailand, I was really looking forward to 'The best Thai food in metro Cleveland'. This was most definitely the second worse thai food I have EVER had. The curries were absolutely horrible, the fried rice was under-cooker, and absolutely tasteless. The spring rolls seemed stale and were cold. The crazy noodles were heavily al-dente, and drove me crazy - being BLAND!!! I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Also, from a customer service perspective, I have never been to a restaurant that includes a sleeping 17 month old as an individual to account towards a party of 6 for 18% gratuity. Absolute rubbish!"}
{"text":"Initially I kind of like this restaurant but after checking on my credit card transaction, I GOT REALLY PISSED! I wrote a 10% tip on the merchant copy but they deducted 15% instead!   FOLKS , PLS CHECK ON YOUR TRANSACTIONS COS this is such an dishonest act. May Their god bless their restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good and in a neat town. The White Tuna Salad was very unique and full of asian flavors. I really enjoyed the meal and hope to return one day soon."}
{"text":"Good food and nice people that is my definition of this place. Great for lunch and dinner the service is good and prices are reasonnable, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  They're so accommodating and I admit, I'm high-maintenance. They just want to please and they do a great job!  Really so yummy. I think portion sizes need to be bigger. My fam/friends and I always leave unsatisfied due to portions. That's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Pad Thai I've ever had! When I order take out it's always quick which I appreciate .... I would recommend this place to anyone :)"}
{"text":"Peppermint is one of my favorite go-to restaurants close to home. They're relatively fast when ordering takeout. We usually order food for 3-5 people, and it's always very good. The quality of food doesn't differ between takeout and dine in, it's always delicious. I haven't been inside Peppermint for a while, but the interior has nice decorations and, from what I remember, the staff was always attentive and polite. Their Pad Thai (I think shrimp and chicken comes automatically) is my favorite thing on the menu, and I could probably eat the whole container in one sitting! The beef satay is also very good, well seasoned and gets a bonus point because it's on a stick, and who doesn't love things on sticks? This review is getting long, but Peppermint is so good that the deliciousness of their food can't be explained in words! Definitely try the pad thai, beef satay (the peanut sauce that comes with it is the best sauce I've ever tasted, and it goes well in the pad thai), and if you're in the mood for yummy hot food, try Peppermint!"}
{"text":"Still like the food there. But the service is really going down. We had a party of three, and the servant deemed us as large party and added tips on top of our check without mentioning it, until asked."}
{"text":"My wife and I have gone here four times and we have enjoyed it every time. The food is consistently good and is out on the table shortly after ordering. It's kind of situated in an obscure little plaza next to a hardware store, but if you like Thai food, you cannot go wrong here.  I've had the pad Thai a couple of times, pad see u and the crazy noodles...all very good. The one thing that precludes a 5-star rating is that the appetizers that we have had were nothing special, but the main entrees are so good that it's not a deal breaker.  We took our daughter a couple of times and while the choices for kids are limited, she was always satisfied with her meal. They garnished her plate with a carrot carved into the shape of a fish and a flower. She loved that and proceeded to crunch on them.  We will be back whenever we need a Thai fix."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! I have been looking for a good pad tai place for awhile & have found it!! I ordered the traditional pad tai dish with chicken, shrimp, scallions and peanuts.  It was delicious and not too spicy! I also ordered jasmine rice, which I have had before elsewhere and have loved, but the jasmine rice didn't have much taste at this particular restaurant.  I couldn't taste the jasmine. I went with a friend and we ordered plum wine, which was very sweet & tasty! It was a nice compliment to the pad tai dish.  Overall, this was a wonderful dinner experience, and I will most definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the green curry. Spring rolls were perfectly done, browned and crispy. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. The place was full on a Monday night which is a good sign."}
{"text":"I ordered the mango curry which was not only wonderful but PLENTY! I was just as excited to have the left overs for lunch! Owners are beyond friendly! Over all a delightful experience!"}
{"text":"We love it here and while we get to go very often, today we decided to dine in since we were bopping around and in the area. My kids are huge fans of the bubble teas and they always get the Thai tea and the mango. Admittedly , I could drink 10 of them myself as they are simply so refreshing.   As for the food- yummy. We love the crazy noodles and all of the curry dishes. In addition, they have some great chili sauce steak and also wonderful seafood dishes. Honestly, we have never had a a bad meal from Peppermint. Their pad Thai is amazing and one of my favorite meals when I feel a little indulgent.  The atmosphere is definitely upbeat and sort of swanky. It's well decorated and you feel like you are doing some serious fine dining. Service is fab and Have always been taken care of. Just a really Great Thai restaurant and worth the visit."}
{"text":"I've been to Peppermint Thai a few times and have always had a great experience. 100% of the times I've been here or gotten take out it was to eat with my family so I definitely get warm fuzzies thinking about good times with family munching on some fresh Thai food!  The people who work here are really friendly and I remember dining in a few years ago and getting a cute carrot carved to look like a fish! When a restaurant goes to the trouble of cooking you fresh food and hand carving sea creatures to entertain patrons you know they care!  My favorite dish here is the Pad Thai Country Style but everything I've tried has been tasty. Next time I'm home visiting family I'm sure Peppermint Thai will be on our agenda!"}
{"text":"Over rated, over priced. Mediocre at best. Good Thai tough to find in Cleveland. Instead, try Cilantro downtown Akron or Pad Thai in Montrose area. Both worth it if you are traveling distance for good Thai."}
{"text":"Did takeout from here twice in the last couple years - both times the food was excellent. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very good. I had the rd madness. It was a red curry sea food dish. Spicy but not over powering."}
{"text":"The food was delicious; I had crab sticks which is one of their specials. In addition the service was amazing and our food came out 3-5 minutes after we ordered."}
{"text":"This place was SUCH a gem! You walk in and immediately feel Like your in an authentic place. The woman running the front desk is NOT games about this establishment. It seems to be hers or at least she's the point person. She is dressed to the nines, handling the phone and seating tables and even taking babies to the back. Off that alone I'm rockin with this place. I am in town visiting family and was taken out to this restaurant. The panang curry with duck was the JAM!! The vibes are authentic and it's nice to find a place that has great food and great service."}
{"text":"It was packed on a Friday night around 8 and we had a 20 min wait. There aren't many strong Thai restaurants in the CLE area, and it was better than expected. The country pad thai was flavorful, but not spicy at all. It could have used a little heat. The mango curry was pretty good, but I'd avoid the green curry (strong anise flavor). The spring rolls were so-so, only worth eating because I skipped lunch. Service was slow. 3.25 stars"}
{"text":"My takeout order of crazy noodles arrived with the palest-looking, borderline undercooked chicken.  I was too skeeved out to risk it.  What a bummer."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant for lunch.  Flavors are mainly mild and ingredients mostly familiar at this transcendent Thai restaurant on Lander Circle, making Peppermint a stress-free destination for both the dinner crowd and the lunch crowd. Among the many options, find plenty of noodle and rice dishes, as well as seafood, curries, and vegetarian treats. A small kids' menu expands the family friendly theme.  My favorites are Coventry Madness and all their Seafood with rice dishes."}
{"text":"Tried a number of different Thai restaurants in Cleveland and this is by far the best option. Flavorful food, clean, great atmosphere... Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Staying near by while traveling and Yelp reviews looked promising. We were not disappointed!! Food and service was excellent. I will need to find another reason to come back to Cleveland so I can go back to Peppermint Thai."}
{"text":"Great pad Thai with chicken, fast service, friendly space!  Would definitely return to explore more of the menu"}
{"text":"I got the red curry and it was flavorful and well made. The crazy noodle had well made noodles, the best I've ever had. The shrimp was very good. Children had fried rice and it all got eaten. Best restaurant experience we've had in Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on the recommendation of friends. ~$32 for two w/o drinks. We had the following:  Spring Roll, which they call Siam Roll  I would not recommend these as they were too small and too much wrapping and not enough filling. They were about the size of a finger (you get 5) and were not at all a light crispy veg. stuffed delight and more like the Taquitos one gets from the frozen section of the grocery store.  Spinach Dumplings (a special) These were tasty. A bit undercooked but good. I don't know if this is a reflection on their other dumplings.  Pad Thai Country Style The noodles were al dente but I think that was good as it made them toothsome. The dish, as a whole, was enjoyable, but a bit sweet. The shrimp tasted about as commercial as possible, but the tofu in the dish was good. Again, as a whole, I would be inclined to order this dish again.  Green Curry (w/ chicken) This dish was good and I would recommend it. The veggies were fresh and not overcooked. The \"jasmine\" rice was mushy as though it had been sitting in the steamer fro way too long making seem like sticky rice, but it wasn't. No worries as it was still an effective accompaniment to the curry. While the curry garners two of three stars indicating some heat, it was very, very mild. Further, like the Country Pad Thai, it was too sweet. I suspect that they add a good deal of sugar to the food as both dishes were inordinately sweet. Still, we enjoyed this dish and, if to return some time, we might order it again.  The water tastes of chlorine, but it is tap city water I suspect and it is what it is.  If you are looking to add some heat, as I often am, I can recommend the chili sauce, which you need to ask for. It looks like the typical weak, watery, ineffectual stuff one often finds in lesser Thai restaurants, but in fact does offer some real heat and flavor.  Service: Our main server was fine, show up just enough. Another server though took plates away, w/ food on them, while we were clearly still eating. We had arrived at the end of the lunch hour, but my feeling is, you are either open or closed and if the former, provide good service until the diner leaves."}
{"text":"Always a good meal.  Comfortable seating. Convenient location to meet up with friends in the eastern suburbs.  Well managed and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant 3-4 times and have always come away pleased. Yesterday we had lunch. Me: Tofu Oad Thai. My wife: Vegetable Pad Thai. The rice noodles were top notch, tasty and not overly oily. We are always on guard for pan fried or grilled food. My wife;s veggies were done to perfection, except she said the carrots could have been done more. I would say the same for the bits of tofu, but I still enjoyed them. One negative: our tea was served in a large coffee cup and refilled from a carafe. We would not order tea again.   However, that's one small negative weighed against many positives. Service is great. Staff is friendly throughout. Food was hot. The ambiance is fine, and the place is busy. Prices are reasonable and portions adequate. Four thumbs up for Peppermint Thai. We certainly  will return, and we recommend this place. We live three hours away and shop in the vicinity now and then. ."}
{"text":"Shrimp in the blanket is our favorite, crispy outside and tender inside.  Satay is good.  Tom yom goong is average.  Pad thai is above average.  Panang curry is tasty, but will not order chicken next time because it is a little rubbery.  Overall, a decent Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very accommodating to dietary needs (gluten free, vegetarian, etc)."}
{"text":"I was impressed.  Lately the Thai food I've been getting at other places has been kind of generic. This place had a nice blending of flavors.   The pad thai was to die for.  It had an extra something that made it a step above.  I also enjoyed the pot stickers and the crazy noodles were crazy good;0  My friends also enjoyed their rice dishes.   Prices were fair, atmosphere was casual maybe going for a little upscale. The service was ok, no complaints."}
{"text":"Consistently great every single time. Been eating here for years and the service and the food is perfect and exactly as ordered always. It's always packed, service is always polite and speedy. Glad to have this gem just moments away from my house! Thanks Peppermint!"}
{"text":"Delicious tamarind duck! The meat was well done, great crispiness. The tamarind sauce was delicious"}
{"text":"Very popular lunch spot just off the circle. While there is a rather direct sign on the hostess stand stating cell phone use can lose you service, try the Pad Thai as it's tasty and well balanced. Eating in is better than carry out but can get loud."}
{"text":"I still give their food the top score. I had the tom yum soup again, followed by a delicious tofu and vegetables dish which was served in a nouveau style--on a flat rectangular plate, with a pyramid tower of rice. The dish had avocados, red and green peppers, onions and carrots and was heaven to the palette.     I was there during the busy lunch hour when the place was packed."}
{"text":"Like the decor in the restaurant.  Food is so-so but I think is pretty good in Cleveland area."}
{"text":"First time at Peppermint Thai Cuisine.  I've been to several other Thai restaurants in the Cleveland area and this is one of the best.  Started off with the Tom Yum Goong - Hot and sour shrimp soup seasoned with lemon grass, chilies, mushroom and lime. This was very good with the spiciness you would expect from a hot and sour soup but not too spicy.  For dinner, I went with the Thai Basil. This is a relatively traditional Thai dish. Spicy minced chicken sautéed with onion, mushroom, straw mushroom, basil leaves, red and green pepper in a Thai style chili sauce. You have a choice of brown or white rice on the side - I opted for the brown.  The portions were all a good size.  This comes medium spicy but you can ask them to make it mild or more spicy. I went with the medium which was very good and had a good level of spice.  I do like spicy food so will probably ask it to be a little more spicy the next time.   While totally stuffed from the meal, I had to try one of the deserts. The banana chocolate spring rolls were amazing!  They come out warm with a warm fresh banana filling and have chocolate drizzled over the top.  You get 6 of them with a small side of whipped cream.  Very good!  The wait staff was attentive and provided good suggestions on meal options.  Be sure to check out the Thai beers too."}
{"text":"It's going to be awhile before I get a feel for food in Cleveland, and this was my first foray into the restaurant scene.  Peppermint Cafe goes for a simple decor scheme, with fairly nice table cloth over older dark wood.  It's not shi-shi by any means, but the trappings clean and effective; not distracting, garish, or ostentatious in any way.  They are merely a trifle bland.  The menu is a bit more complex the family style Thai -- but cooked mildly.  The spice balance is also a tad bland for my taste; and I'm not sure whether this is an accomodation to the clientele, or whether a stylistic choice by the chef.  I'll probably visit here again, since it will be near to where I live.  At the same time, I'm a bit worried about setting my standards too high.  Not bad, but need local reference marks to decide whether this is a 4 for the city, or less."}
{"text":"Great little place. Me and my wife split an appetizer and tamarind duck (which was great). You can really enjoy yourself and not break a bank. Most main course dishes are under $20. Good value and great quiet place."}
{"text":"I've only eaten at Peppermint once, but now that Mint Cafe on Coventry has closed its doors, it's likely that I'll be eating here more frequently.   The singular dining experience I've had at Peppermint was fantastic. The waitstaff was extremely friendly and attentive. My party and I were seated immediately and the waiter did a great job with \"reading\" our table (knowing when we were ready to order, when we needed refills on our drinks, when our plates should be cleared, etc.) When my friends asked for their pad thai to be served without chicken and shrimp, the waiter intuited that they might be vegan and asked if they also wanted their dishes to be prepared without fish sauce (a gesture that my friends really appreciated.)  I don't have much (read: any) experience with authentic Thai food, so my frame of reference for what may constitute an authentic tasting or well-spiced dish is very limited. That said, I really enjoyed the vegetable dumpling soup (the broth had a very simple, but satisfying, understated flavor and the dumplings were delicious) and the pad thai country style, which had a flavor that managed to be both savory and sweet. The thai iced tea was also delicious.  Again, now that Mint Cafe is closed, Peppermint will likely become my \"go to\" place for Thai food in the Cleveland Heights area. If my continued experiences with Peppermint are anywhere near as good as my first, I'll definitely be revising this to a 5-star review."}
{"text":"I am giving Peppermint Cafe 5 stars because it has been a very pleasant experience every time I have been there.  THe quality of the food is great, very fresh, but most importantly the service is and always has been professional and pleasant.  This restaurant knows that a properly trained serving staff can make or break a restaurant...add that to the quality of the food, and that equals success!  No matter how crowded they are, we can get in and out in 30 to 40 minutes.  The location is in Pepper Pike, in the Landerwood Plaza (near Heinens), tucked next to a hardware store.  The owners have done a very nice job with the interior, for me it is a calming decor."}
{"text":"Very nice folks working here but the food was just hot. No flavor. It's a coconut milk curry, why don't I taste coconut!?  I spent 5 minutes with the staff to get their personal favorites and selected 2 of those. Both were just not good at all. Passed for food but not up to par.  Boo!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai is good, but overly sweet, Siam rolls no taste, beef sticks great ... Still a very good restaurant ... I'll stick to the curry dishes next time"}
{"text":"Yum! Always a delicious delight. I highly recommend their chicken wing appetizer! They also have great lunch deals."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice place for dinner on the East side. A friend suggested Peppermint Thai. I'm not a frequent Thai eater, but I'm an adventurous eater and like Asian in general, so ok, let's go. Peppermint Thai delivered.   It's located in an upscale strip mall with a big parking lot in front.   The dining room was pretty crowded when we arrived about 7:30 on a Wednesday evening. We were seated quickly and the server came round fast asking for a drink order. The menu is pretty extensive and has excellent descriptions. I have to admit a lot of them sounded very good. We started by sharing chicken satay. It was well prepared with two different sauces. Then we each had entree items from the \"Signature dishes\" list.  They both arrived together very quickly. My friend ordered mango curry and I ordered chili duck. The mango curry had chicken and shrimp. It was not too sweet nor too spicy. The duck was boneless with crispy skin and well prepared. The sauce was only mildly spicy which is nice because we were sharing and that's what my friend preferred.   I would recommend this place to someone who doesn't really know about Thai food and wants to try it. It was clean and the service was fast with a very easy to decipher menu. And hey, it's P.W.s \"go to\" Thai place."}
{"text":"Great addition to Lander Circle.  The atmosphere is nice and quiet and the service has always been excellent.  I always order the Crazy Noodles so I guess I can't comment on the food overall, but I can say that the Crazy Noodles are delicious.  Just the right amount of spiciness and huge portion.  Nothing lasts long on that shopping strip if it's not good, so it looks like Peppermint has been quite a hit so far."}
{"text":"Very Tasty. Appetizers were delicious. We had vegetable tempura and pot stickers. Pad Thai was super. They have lots of curry dishes which won my husband over. The service was very fast, friendly and my dish was on fire when it came to the table. Had the green tea ice cream for desert which was weird, but good. They will see me again."}
{"text":"I love coming to peppermint. I usually get take out for lunch and it's always delicious. My favorite is the green curry with brown rice."}
{"text":"I ordered take out after talking toa coworker about fried tofu. I had never had it but was assured it was delicious and this was from a man that said he doesn't like tofu unless it's fried tofu with peanut sauce.  This fried tofu wasn't what I expected from how my coworker described it but I guess every place is different. It was just fried and served with a dipping sauce similar to a sweet and sour but with peanuts and mostly sweet. I guess I expected a thicker more peanutty sauce. I also tried the shrimp in a blanket. The plum sauce makes them! I tried one without sauce and it was alright, with sauce amazing! I also tried the Pad Thai country style without chicken. It was very good. I wish I would have asked for it spicy because it didn't have much heat. This was my first experience with Thai and I thought it was pretty good, I would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Thai food in Cleveland. Ambience is great. Lot of decorative pieces to keep one occupied. Spinach potstickers were delicious. Service was fast and courteous. Lemon grass chicken was a surprise, the chicken were large thin slices which was grilled and then sauted with veggies and soy. Perfectly cooked. The basil chicken fried rice is the best I have eaten in this area. Medium spicy was just right for my palate. Serving size is adequate. We were full with no space for desert but didn't need a doggy bag! All the menu items can be made vegetarian. Doubt that...but good to know.  Will definitely revisit and would recommend. The extra star would come in course of time if things are consistant!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Thai this good since moving from the sf area to north Idaho. I'm in town for training and decided to give this place a try. So glad I did, I called and ordered shrimp rolls, shumai and crazy noodles. My personal preference is a wider cut rice noodle, but they were still fantastic. Tons of basil and spice. The order was ready in 15 mins even tho when I showed up, the place was pretty full. The only thing I would add is offer utensils when a customer is picking up an order, I forgot to ask and luckily I had a fork left over from another meal so I didn't have to use my hands."}
{"text":"Fresh good food, quick service. What else can you ask for? I had crispy duck. It was simply out of this world."}
{"text":"this place is classy. the decor is simple and elegant, the wait staff is very attentive, and the food is delicious. the menu has a very good variety, with great vegetarian selections went here for lunch and ordered the vegetarian dumpling soup, panang curry with tofu over rice noodles, and a thai iced tea. the thai iced to was delicious and creamy. the soup came in a small bowl with three dumplings. the broth was deliciously full of msg and the dumplings were filled with yummy hearty stuffing, not just cabbage or onions. when the panang curry came out i was a little disappointed with the small portion size, but i realized as i was eating it that this was an illusion with the large plate or something because i barely ate half before i was stuffed. of course, i did have the dumpling soup before though. the panang curry was 2 out of 3 stars spicy and i asked if i could have it just mild. it came out quite spicy, more than i comfortably like eating, so i'm not sure if that was their 1 or 2 star. definitely lots of flavor and spiciness. all in all it was super tasty, great service, and very reasonable price! i took the rest of my curry home and it was just as delicious for dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Staff is excellent, and interior is clean, well organized, and nicely designed. I have been there twice so far. I had the masaman curry with salmon previously and the barramundi special with eggplant today (pics attached). Both phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight. My son needed to nurse, so I started nursing him quietly. The hostess came over and threw a napkin at me saying I had to cover up if I wanted to do that in there. Besides the fact that breastfeeding in public in Ohio is legal, and regardless of how you feel about breastfeeding throwing a napkin at anyone is disrespectful. In general no one in the service industry should ever throw anything at a patron.   The appetizers were bland, the food was so so. Everything is overpriced. The desserts were ok. Our server was nice. But with so many good places in CLE to get thai food we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I didn't pay for my lunch here.  The office i'm working in got takeout from Peppermint Thai the other day.  Which was odd, because when it arrived it was pretty clear I was the only Asian food aficionado and I had nothing to do with the restaurant choice.    At any rate, I ordered tofu pad thai spicy (3/5 here) because that's my go-to Thai order anytime I'm trying out a new place.  I really liked some things about it-- I loved that it was topped with a bunch of chopped peanuts, had a good hint of lime, and the tofu was fried perfectly.  On the downside, it wasn't quite as spicy as I'd hoped for and the sauce was quite a bit sweeter than I normally expect.  Not my favorite iteration of the dish, but it passed my test-- if they can make decent pad thai, I'd be willing to branch out and try other dishes in the future.  Based on this experience, I probably won't switch Thai food allegiances from my normal go-to, but I would definitely try it again if offered to me or if i was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service.  I had the yellow curry with chicken and my husband had the sweet and sour chicken. Both were delicious. Service was fast and attentive.  Tips: -Restaurant was pretty busy at 6:15 on a Friday night (we still got a table immediately), so keep that in mind.  -The only thing I'd mention is that there aren't very many dishes that are non - spicy (for my husband). Other than that, a great place!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I shared the Siam Rolls and the dinner portion of the Pad Thai Country Style, medium spice. The Siam Rolls were bland and flavorless. Seemed like something you'd get at a grocery store and stick in the oven. Ick. But the Pad Thai was delicious - both of us agreed it was the perfect level of spice and great taste. Will be back to try the curries!"}
{"text":"I am not a connoisseur of Thai food. But I *loved* my dinner here. I had the Salmon Teriyaki, which wasn't spicy at all (it didn't claim to be: it wasn't marked as one of the spicy dishes). But it's some of the tastiest fish I've had in quite some time: perfectly cooked. The vegetables were well prepared and tested fresh. The rice was good. Service was quick and friendly. I'd *definitely* recommend it."}
{"text":"I've now been to this restaurant twice and tried the pad Thai and then chicken Thai basil. Both dishes were well done and well flavored. Service is prompt.  Also had the opportunity to try the spinach dumplings (pretty good, but nothing to rave about) as well as the chicken satay which was grilled chicken appetizer with dipping sauces (again, pretty good but probably wouldn't order it again when there are other things to try.)   This place was BUMPIN on a Thursday night and we had to wait for 20 minutes for a party of 2 at around 7:00pm. They weren't even running any specials either, everyone was there for the food!   I haven't tried any other Thai restaurants so its tough for me to make any claims like \"best Thai food in Cleveland\" however this place is solid and has a great location for the Eastsiders!"}
{"text":"I tried Pad Thai for the very first time here and ever since and fell in love.  I relocated and have been in search of a comparable dish from nearly every Thai restaurant I have encountered and have only found one that can hold a candle to Peppermint. Always good service and great food!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 11 for a birthday celebration. We were a bit surprised with the seating arrangement. We were seated right smack in the middle of the restaurant rather than the semi private area near the back. Although the original reservation was for 8, it was changed to 11 once a  few of us got to the restaurant. We thought it would have been better if we moved towards the back...  Anyhow, the food was quite good. A few of my friends and I shared basil fried rice, pad thai, chicken panang curry, and braised lamb shank. The fried rice and pad thai was pretty typical compared to other thai establishments. However the curry was differently my favorite. The curry was light and creamy and the chicken was tender and velvety. The lamb shank meat came off the bone easily and was pretty flavorful too. The table also had plenty of appetizers such as the beef satay, crab tempura, siam rolls and a few others.  Now, on to the restaurant's policy/service... Since this was a birthday celebration, we brought in a cake for dessert. We were told that we must order 3 dessert items from the restaurant otherwise we can not eat the cake at the restaurant. Despite our party ordering about a dozen appetizers and 11 entrees (and several drinks) this policy was pretty pathetic. I was pretty upset in finding this policy as I've never came across this anywhere! In fact, most places would offer a complimentary dessert!   Due to this stupid policy, we ended up ordering 2 ice cream and a rice pudding for dessert. Towards the end of the night, we were being served by a different server... The original server did not inform us that there will be a change... A star was definitely deducted due to the service."}
{"text":"I don't think anyone who has been here before has actually had Thai...Spice should not be the only flavor...  I will stick to my little local places."}
{"text":"A relatively recent establishment, Peppermint Cafe is one of the better options for Thai cuisine in the Cleveland area. It is located in a semi-shopping plaza off of Pinetree Rd., but somehow manages to fit well amidst these other business establishments.   Parking spaces are plentiful, and the restaurant is large enough to comfortably seat all of its customers. Ambiance is clean and relatively good. The soft lighting caters to a romantic dinner or a simple group get-together. The service is always excellent, even during the busiest hours.   The food, though I would not consider it authentic Thai, is rich and flavorful, and it is probably the best in its category in Greater Cleveland, outside of the city. There also seems to be a good number of vegetarian options. Make sure to specify how spicy you would like your food. I would recommend any of the curries, Chili Duck (though the last time I had it, it was rather dry), and the Tom Kar Gai. The mango sticky rice makes for a delicious dessert."}
{"text":"Peppermint is the type of place I like to go on special occasions. I've been here for my birthday two different years. Definitely somewhere you can get dressed up to go, have great Thai food, get good service, and see charming decor. The prices are good compared to other places, too.  There will definitely be a wait on the weekends and the tables can feel a little cramped together when it's busy, so be prepared.  Their Pad Thai is really good, but seems to come in a smaller portion compared to other Thai restaurants. Their curries are decently good and all of their appetizers are very good, especially the crab tempura, Shumai, devil wings, and the satays. The drinks are nice and strong as well!  Definitely one of the better Thai restaurants in the area! I recommend it."}
{"text":"It was great. We loved it. I never dined there, but always greeted by the host with my food ready. Delicious and consistent."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Try it NOW if you haven't you can't go wrong. The food is delicious. The service sit in our take out is fast and it's a good deal! Just thinking about this place makes me hungry! I love the spring rolls, Thai Iced tea, and Pad Thai. But really EVERYTHING on the menu is top notch.   There can be a wait to get into this place to get there early! Anyone on the east side knows about how yummy this place is and don't mess around! The tables can also be a bit snug-- Just pretend you are in NYC cause this food is as good as an NYC Thai restaurant and as a New Yorker,  that is saying a lot!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant will forever have a special place in my heart as the first place I tried Boat Trip soup.  My boyfriend and I can't get enough of it!  It's absolutely incredible.  Blows most Pho out of the water.  The service/staff is great and the food is delicious.  I'm moving away from Cleveland and will definitely miss this place!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this restaurant for sometime and we finally made it out. We walked in(three of us) and a baby in a travel stroller who is a special needs child. The host was unwilling to seat us because she said the stroller would be in the way of other people. We attempted to explain that our daughter can't sit in a carrier and needs to be more horizontal but she didn't really seem to care. In the end we left.   The restaurant's response to this review will be that they found a place for us to sit.  However, if you have ever been to this place, you know how spacious and large it is. To say that a stroller would be in the way is just ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place that I've eaten at, period. Every single person that I know loves this place, and I've never had a bad meal there. Also, one of the only places where I've been able to find bubble tea in the East-side suburbs of Cleveland. I recommend this place to anyone who's looking for great service and really great food."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food. Didn't expect that visiting Cleveland but was happily surprised. Plus they had my favorite mango sticky rice so I left extra happy with dinner and dessert in a full belly!"}
{"text":"MmmMmMMMmmmm!!! The animals I work with and I settled on this place for lunch and it was a GREAT idea, service prompt. Food was Delish and I really felt out of place being surrounded by all the beautiful people!!! Ha! Seriously I had the Woodmere chicken string bean with brown rice and cashews. Shoot they had me at cashews!! Had a nice kick to it but not crazy hot and offset nicely with sno peas with red and green peppers. I look forward to coming back here soon!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, clean restaurant.... a great place located on Cleveland's east side.  Never before have I had such great service... such a kind and attentive wait staff!  I will definitely come back when I am working in the area.  If you want good thai food with great service, come to Peppermint.  They make a pretty good lycee martini too :)"}
{"text":"The pad thai and green curry are great!"}
{"text":"I really love Peppermint and it is a real treat to go for lunch. It is really clean and has a better decor than any other Thai restaurant I have visited. The stadd has always been friendly and the service attentive. The first time I ever had Pad Thai was here. I tried it somewhere else afterwards and then determined I would only get it here. Their crab rolls and spinach potstickers are very good. Panang curry is where it's at for me. I have had it pretty spicy here and have enjoyed every runny nose, too."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town. The food is always delicious, service is fast for both dine in and take out, staff is always friendly and efficient. I love their food and my 3 friends that were born and raised in Thailand all swear it is about as authentic as you can get short of hopping on a 14hr flight and dining in Bangkok."}
{"text":"Wide selection of wines.  Broader menu of entrees than in usual Thai places.  We share the spinach dumplings, which were green, with spinach in the dough.  Very tasty.  My wife had grilled walleye and I had steamed walleye in curry.  We loved both.  Very knowledgeable and helpful service."}
{"text":"I really like Thai, Chinese, and some Japanese food. This particular restaurant was no exception. In fact, I think their food was really quite good!  The waitress quickly arrived and asked us what wed like to eat. That's great because I hate waiting for someone to show up when I am at lunch on a week day.   I ordered Thai tea and the garlic salmon with jasmin rice. My fellow coworkers ordered dishes and adjusted their spicy level according to their liking. I was surprised when I tried one of my coworkers food; the spices were dead on. It wasn't overwhelming but added to the flavor of the meal. Perfect Thai food!  My garlic salmon was cooked just perfect. It was falling apart as I touched it with my fork. No knife needed. Although, there was not much garlic flavor at all. I can't complain considering it was so yummy.  In addition, portion sizes were quite good for the price. I was extremely satisfied when we left."}
{"text":"The manager tore up the check into pieces angrily when you complained the dish was not fully cooked!   I am a regular customer and I went to peppermint on 8/8 lunchtime. I ordered green curry. When the dish came, the beef and the chicken were not fully cooked. The rice was very hard, seemed still frozen, I showed the waitress the sterdy  \" rice ball\" and asked her give me a new dish of green curry, not just reheat.   How when the dish came, apparently it was a reheat one. ( because I ate one shrimp and some avocado. There's no avocado and just one shrimp)   I wanted to complain but  no manager was there until I was ready to go. Once I saw her I told her what was going on. She denied immediately and said it's impossible. I said the curry just 10 dollars something, I don't have to lie. She suddenly tore up the check into pieces! She said is it what you want? Ok don't worry about the money!  I can't believe how rude a person can be!"}
{"text":"I definitely drove 20 min out to Pepper Pike to try out this Thai food because of all the great reviews. Unfortunately, that also meant that the food wasn't hot by the time i got back home =(  I ordered the Devil Wings and Pad Thai Country Style  I'm normally used to ordering Thai chicken wings and getting some fried chicken wings smothered in delicious thai sweet and slightly spicy sauce with a light, fresh dipping sauce on the side e.g. Tamarind Chili Sauce. Unfortunately, when I opened my package from Peppermint, I was greeted with undressed fried chicken wings with a sauce on the side. The wings were fine, but the sauce tasted like the \"special sauce\" at Hot Sauce Williams... not anything special  The Country Pad Thai was also good but not amazing, definitely not spicy in an way, it tasted like regular pad thai.. which is fine because I love Pad Thai. However, the shrimp didn't taste like it was seasoned before it was cooked.  Overall, the food was good. Not amazing as I had hoped. I wonder how much of that had to do with the fact that it wasn't fresh and hot. Next time I return (because I will return) I will try to dine in, the restaurant itself looked very classy and nice."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place. Ordered the thai red curry! Loved it. I'm definitely going back here again!"}
{"text":"Solid thai option.  Nothing blew.me away, but nothing to complain about.  Had crab Rangoon type app.  A unique spring roll type presentation which was nice.  Had the fat noodle, pad si ew I believe it's called.  Everything was fresh and fine, but I'm used to a bit more brown sause and flavor.  Perhaps this is gold.standsrd for this area.  Wouldn't hold up in Milwaukee, but like I said, nothing was bad.  Service was great.  Give them a shot."}
{"text":"So. Amazing.  Now I can't say I'm one to have ever been too spoiled with Thai food, but it is absolutely my favorite cuisine and I have high expectations every time I visit a Thai restaurant. (I need to make it to Thailand someday...sigh)  Everything that I've had here has been absolutely fantastic. I crave Peppermint even when it's sitting in front of my face. I crave it even when I'm eating it. I'm craving it right now. (._.)  I have a REALLY hard time straying away from the curries, especially the red ones, but I have had Panang, Masaman, Green and Yellow curry. I love all of the different protein options and every single curry has been really flavorful and delicious. I'm one who loves spicy food (Carolina Reaper GET AT ME) so even with the highest spice rating...I think their stuff could use a little more heat. That being said, other people have found rating 2 to their liking, so to each his own. I'm used to Sri Lankan food levels of spice, and Thai is also up there so always expecting it. Regardless, the flavors of the curry and how crisp the vegetables are while still being coated...perfection. I'm never disappointed with the actual content of the curry. You get a perfect ratio of veggies and protein to curry and rice. If I control myself enough I can let Future Mel get some leftovers, but usually it's all scarfed down equally.  In terms of appetizers, I've had the summer rolls (always fresh! not the biggest fan of summer rolls themselves but I enjoy the ones here), shumai (steamed, really really good), edamame, spinach potstickers (yum! and make me feel...healthy), and the Siam Rolls. Siam rolls are good but nothing extraordinary. They taste a lot better with the sauces...and in all honesty I keep getting them!  I've also ventured out to their noodle and fried rice menu. I had their Pad Thai Country Style, and their Basil Fried Rice. I definitely favored the Basil Fried Rice. I don't know what they do to make all the flavors mesh together so well. It's aromatic without being overwhelming, and I still had plenty leftover for the next day. The noodles were delicious, but being less of a noodle fan I think I'm going to keep doing curry rotations and every so often force myself onto a noodle dish just because of all of the other rave reviews!  And! BF has gotten Duck Choo Chee (he had to pry himself away from that menu item just to try other things...haha), Mango Curry, Yellow, and Masaman. We're both pretty much drooling when we decide that it's a Peppermint kinda day.  Oh! And they have amazing Lychee Martinis if you're into that sorta thing! The alcohol doesn't overwhelm the fruit flavor at all...it's actually how I got the BF to try something lychee flavored for the first time and he was not disappointed.   Rereading this review makes me want to go back. I'll be seeing you soon, Peppermint."}
{"text":"The family ordered take out for a joint bday party. We started with the Tom Yum soup. It was decent but it was lacking heat that I'm accustomed too. It had shrimp, asian mushrooms and a few flakes of cilantro. Essentially it was Pepper Piked down for gringos.  We ordered several dishes. I had the green curry with chicken , shrimp and beef, it was pretty good.  Another tasty dish was the mango chicken. It was pretty good but smack yo mamma good, whatever that means.   My nephew ordered pad Thai, no peanuts and no bean sprouts like a true family member screw with the order. It was very unspectacular.   We ordered some fried rice dish , I did not partake.   This is a suburban Thai restaraunt and they definitely cater to suburban tastes, dummied down. I would try this place again and ask them to make it spicy and not white people spicy."}
{"text":"The five stars is for the fantastic panang curry.  I cannot wait to order this again and I still have left overs in my fridge.  The crazy noodle was okay but the panang was so much better that I'll explore different menu items in search of something as good.  The crazy noodle didn't stand a chance against the perfectly seasoned curry.  The restaurant has a nicer ambiance than most Cleveland thai establishments. Entrees were between 11 and 18$, the specialty items on the higher end and the typical curries, noodles, rice dishes on the lower end.  Be careful about arriving here just 30 minutes to close because one time they said it was too late to order anything but carry out."}
{"text":"Food is good, but not great.   Service is hurried, but not outrageous.  The owner/manager is curt and doesn't belong in a role where interchange with customers is required.  She is doing her customers a favor by seating them.  Her nickname is\"the dragon lady.\""}
{"text":"The food was okay , not much flavor. Prices are fine. The service was VERY slow. And our table had to ask multiple times for refills on our drinks. Then just gave us a carafe, which barely filled one cup. Tables are super close. You can hear everyone's conversations.  Hopefully the renovation will help shape things up!"}
{"text":"Peppermint Cafe is as good as Thai food gets in Cleveland! I've been coming here, and to its old sister location on Coventry, for several years, and I'm always impressed. The servers are always very friendly and diligent, and there isn't a very long wait for the food once you order. Since I come here pretty regularly, I've tried many different options on the menu, and all have been great, but some stand-out choices are the Barramundi in panang curry, pad thai country style (which is a spicier version of pad thai), and the seafood coconut soup. But honestly, you can't go wrong, because I've never tried anything that wasn't tasty! Also make sure you try the bubble tea! Mango and taro are my go-to's, but like I said before, you can't go wrong with anything!"}
{"text":"Hmm, I'd give Peppermint a 3.5 if allowed. The service was excellent I will say and I thought it was genius that our server served us our dishes family-style after listening to our conversation about tasting one-another's selections. Appetizers: The chicken potsticker was ordinary, but the shrimp in a blanket was excellent. Main Courses: Pepper Pike Treasure, Basil Rice, Chili Duck, and a Under the Sea (red curry). The favs were the Chili duck (fried to perfection) and Basil Rice (well-blended ingredients); the others were just ordinary Thai dishes to me. The red curry was not as balanced as I've had; the pepper and coconut milk were overdone (yes, these ingredients are the epitome of red curry, but so much so that that's all I could taste, I think not!). The portions are generous if that's your thing. Dessert: The Chocolate Banana spring rolls? were so-so."}
{"text":"One of the higher-end Thai restaurants I've been to - amazing quality of food and hecka tasty!! Their Basil Fried Rice was on-point with the spice level and flavor. We came here on our visit to Ohio and wish there were Thai places like this back home!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant.  We go here at least 2 times a month.  Take out or staying it is great either way."}
{"text":"The best Thai in Cleveland. Now the most expansive menu which may ignore a few more obscure traditional favorites ( but still, ask them and they make those perfectly).  Spices, consistency, freshness are amazing!"}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite Thai restaurant, and I look forward to eating here whenever I'm in Cleveland. I've never been disappointed by any of the food. A few of my staple menu choices: chicken pad thai (duh), tom kar gai, lard nar, and yellow curry. The vegetable rainbow and potstickers are also very tasty!  The tom kar gai soup is sooo good. It's full of large pieces of chicken and a variety of mushrooms. The broth is absolutely delicious and not too rich. Note to server: just because you brought my food before I finished my soup does not give you permission to take away my bowl...I was planning to finnish every last drop, and I'd probably lick it clean if nobody was watching! Note to self: eat soup faster next time before somebody steals it, since the food comes out so fast.  Pad Thai is a must here. It's not too sweet, and they definitely do not skimp on the chicken (or whatever other protein you order).   The yellow curry is my new fav. It's full of potatoes, pumpkin, squash, pineapple, mushrooms, etc. The spice is perfect for me, with just a little kick. Wish they'd give you more than just a small \"cone\" of rice to soak up the yummy sauce...  Good thing I eat there with people that like to share...with all of these good options, what's a girl to do?!"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Pepper Pike, Peppermint is my go to for thai take out. I have tried many things on the menu - from their pad thai, pad thai country style, crazy noodle, tofu string bean, curry dishes including their fabulous panang, devil wings - and everything I have tried has been delicious. The menu is very vast so its great to be able to try new things every time and be confident that I wont be disappointed. The staff is also very friendly upon arrival. I definitely recommend Peppermint for the best Thai in the area!"}
{"text":"Dined here on Valentine's Day with my valentine!   Have dined here several previous times and have always been impressed with the quality and presentation of their dishes.   We enjoyed an appetizer of Summer Rolls. Our entrees were the Crazy Noodle, Basil Fried Rice and Chicken Basil.  We chose Brown Rice. Our dishes had the perfect bit of Asian \"bite\". Mild but noticeable.  Outstanding restaurant! Freindly, knowledgeable staff. Very clean, comfortable place. The oriental ambience puts you in the mood for an excellent meal and ours was!"}
{"text":"This is the first Thai I've had in Cleveland. The restaurant is currently under construction, but they have it closed off nicely so it isn't disruptive. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. I really loved the fresh flowers on every table. The staff were all extremely friendly. They worked hard to make sure I was always taken care of.  I started with the Siam Rolls. They were good. A basic fried roll summer roll. For dinner I had the Pad Thai. I liked that it comes with a variety of meat and fish: Chicken, shrimp, and scallops. The flavor was good, but I wish there was more of it. Each bite was like a tease. I'm so torn between giving 3 and 4 stars. Overall it was a good meal and based on the overall experience I feel bad giving less than 4."}
{"text":"Wanted to purchase a Gift Certificate for a friend and have it mailed for her birthday. They just couldn't do t hat. Really????? Oh well there loss!!"}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant in Cleveland area. The soup is so good. The curry lamb shank is amazing. Also mango stick rice dessert is very good."}
{"text":"The place is quite large. Patient servers and the wait time is short. The food was great but I've tasted better Tom Yon Gong soup. Other than that the Pad Thai was great and their drink menu is great. I have to give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"I am not kidding when I say this, I am struggling to describe how bad this restaurant is. The food was far from impressive, but that was not the highlight of the visit. The highlight was the spot for top 3 worst service spots I've experienced in my life. After being ignored by our waiters, they openly and arrogantly complained to my face about the smaller than usual tip that was left for them, which is what they deserved. Extremely unprofessional and I will never step foot into this place ever again."}
{"text":"This place surprised me.   For a Tuesday night at 8pm, the restaurant was packed. When we sat down at our table, we ordered right away... and our appetizer was to our table within 5 minutes, and our entrees within 10 of that. It was the fastest service ever.  The green curry was what I expected. Good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I was surprised at the small amount of rice they gave, and was charged when I asked for more. (This just strikes me as odd with curry. I'm not going to drink it!) My guest had the pad thai, which she really enjoyed. Their pad thai has a sweeter tone to it, so be ready for it! I'm looking forward to coming back again soon and trying one of their signature dishes, which seems to be the smarter way to go.   So, how did it get its name? They have a sister location, and when they opened this one in Pepper Pike, boom! Peppermint Thai. It literally has nothing to do with peppermint. This location also had a nice ambience, with thoughtful décor of modern buddhas placed throughout. Not only was the service lightening fast, but also our server was very knowledgeable and helpful. This will be a new place to go when I'm crunched for time!"}
{"text":"The past several times that we've come here have been fantastic, so I decided it was time to update the review.  Peppermint is now my favorite Thai place in the Cleveland area.  We go there almost weekly.  The service is always great, as is the food.  The food quality and taste have seemed to improve over the past couple of months.  The green curry and crazy noodles are my favorites, but everything that I have had here is on point.  If you like spicy food like me, they will make your items very spicy if you ask."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here for supper on a Tuesday night. We were shocked to see how crowded it was on a weekday night. There were about 6 people waiting ahead of us. We waited about 20 min to be seated. We were seated at a tiny table closely in line with others, offering little privacy for conversation. The food was good and so was the service, but I will not be returning anytime soon due to the negatives I mentioned before. It was especially annoying to have to wait so long to be seated on a weekday night. :("}
{"text":"Truly the best Thai I have ever had outside of Thailand.  The entire staff really cares about the guests and the food is amazingly and consistently great.  I have tried at least 20 different meals and have never been disappointing.  The best meal on the menu for me is the lamb shank.  I ask them to substitute the potato for eggplant and it is a true delight.  The portion is great, the texture and seasoning is perfect, and it is served beautifully."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch and was pleased with my massaman curry. I'd never seen it served with avocado and white potatoes before (normally sweet potatoes are used). It was different but still pretty good. The place was packed and it seemed like we had to wait a bit longer than I thought we should to get drinks/order, but our food came out quickly. That's essential when you're heading out for lunch on a work day. Our portions were definitely lunch sized, but the price was lunch sized, too.   Overall, I think this is a good place to get some solid Thai food. It might not be the best Thai food I've ever eaten, but it definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Those of you who lived in University Heights/Cleveland Heights may remember a wonderful little thai place on Coventry called Mint Cafe.  They had, quite possibly, the best thai food in the Cleveland metropolitan area.  Then, it closed down and was replaced by a new restaurant called High Thai'd.  High Thai'd kept the decor, kept the menu, and changed the food.  For the worse.  So what did I do?  Mint Cafe's website directed me to this place in Pepper Pike (oh god, where is Pepper Pike??).  I was discouraged for a couple of months, but last month I decided to drive the half hour here and check it out.  Found this place located next to a supermarket in a shopping area deep within Pepper Pike suburbia.  Well, lo and behold, this is Mint Cafe.  The decor is different, the menu is the same, and the food is the same!  Even the signature Golden Bags appetizer that I used to love at Mint Cafe is here at the Pepper Pike place.  Had the Pad See You and the Tamarind Duck - both had a good mix of flavors (weren't overloaded with ginger) and were reminiscent of the quality thai food I used to have at Mint Cafe.  The waiters were even wearing Mint Cafe uniforms! (no seriously, they said \"Mint Cafe\" on them!)  They were a bit overstaffed on the Sunday evening that I tried the place, so they were constantly refilling my water.  But I guess that's a good thing, too. =)  If this restaurant wasn't so far away, I'd be going here every other week."}
{"text":"Best peanut satay with chicken or beef. I get it every time and also try one entree. Paired with crazy noodles is delish. Great for take-out too. Lots of parking in the strip mall."}
{"text":"Hmmm... I haven't been here in awhile, and after my last visit I don't think I'm missing out on anything. It did taste acceptable for the price! However, my issue is all the carrots that came in my serving.SO. MANY. CARROTS. I get it, carrots are cheap and a meal stretcher. I really want equal parts of all of the vegetables though. I'm not trying to eat a curry carrot stew.  I also would say don't go here if you're looking for tradition Thai food. I mean, there was avocado in my curry... It tasted good! But I'm pretty sure there is no avocado in Thailand."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite restaurants! Everything I've had there is absolutely delicious. Staff is friendly, and service is generally quick. Great for takeout, too!   Some dishes I definitely recommend are the crazy noodles, panang curry, and mango curry. Additionally, they have great bubble tea! I recommend the thai iced tea, green tea, and mango flavors, but you can't go wrong with any."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my top favorites for Thai in Cleveland. Noodle dishes are solid, haven't tried their fusion seafood dishes though. Definitely excited it's right down the street since I always leave in a stuporous food coma state!"}
{"text":"Delicious, great & fast service. One of the best Thai restaurants I have eaten at (comparing to those in Bay Area, California!) The interior of the restaurant is really nice too..  Crab tempura was great! Soft shell crab topped with papaya strips with mango chutney sauce.   Pad see ew was superbly made, every noodle was seasoned and not clumping together. It has chicken and shrimp in it rather than meat options, though I am sure you can specify the order.  Green curry was amazing! Generous portions of very soft beef, mixed with avocado, eggplant, large chunks of bamboo, some peas and green beans. Very unique and yummy!"}
{"text":"I went to this Thai Restaurant last week with just me, my husband and my 4 yr old daughter. I gave a healthy tip of 10% on top of the bill , supposed to be deducted from credit card but whoever the cashier was, deducted 15% instead. Is 15% tips compulsory? The service wasn't that great either. I called the restaurant about it and just to receive the callback saying they have no records of the receipt/transaction and the lady isn't feeling apologetic or being really helpful. I got really disappointed.   IT IS SHOWN ON THE C C STATEMENT.  SUCH DISHONEST ACTS, NO MORE PATRONIZING THIS RESTUARANT. I feel robbed.  Consumers, pls keep the receipts and check on your transactions. Thank you."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this authentic Thai restaurant.  I went with a colleague, who had travelled to Thailand over the winter, and she also said that the food was great.  Very reasonable prices for lunch, and the service was very good.  We did not wait long for our meals either, which is great when you are rushed for time.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've had in Cleveland. The Siam rolls and potstickers were delicious, but the crazy noodles and Tom Yum Goong will bring me back. Only reason not 5 stars is because I feel like the portion sizes on the entrees are rather small."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried the Peppermint Thai restaurant after reading all the Yelp reviews. We love thai food, and we compare the restaurants with their neighboring restaurants. With the waitress's recommendation, we ordered the tom yum soup, seafood soup, pad thai, mango curry, and basil fried rice, and mango sticky rice. The dishes were good, except the Tom Yum soup. It was literally just watered down; no flavor whatsoever! So we told the waitress nicely that we did not like the soup at all, its very bland. She basically just smiled and said, \"sorry\", and walked away. We noticed another employee was standing by whom could overhear the conversation, but did not offer any solution. My husband and I were just stunned, and figured that the employees doesn't really care about the customer's satisfaction. We left the soup bowl as it was, and at the end they took it back along with other completed dishes. We may just stick with our other favorite thai restaurants- who can give better recommendations, and care about their customer's satisfaction."}
{"text":"My husband and I keep trying to find a good Thai restaurant near us since we moved to the east side of Cleveland and we finally hit the jackpot. The atmosphere with inside it was seriously so perfect and it was an overcrowded. The food however is unbelievable. We cannot believe how delicious it was and it was so good that we have gone back twice since. We both got Curry but two different kinds. I got a mango special curry and it was unbelievable that I was actually scraping the bowl to get every little last drop. My husband had a curry that had steak in it and the steak was cooked so perfectly that it actually had a red center as well. We cannot say enough about this restaurant and we cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love the Massaman chicken and the kids love the potstickers. We have also loved the Satays and th Summer Rolls. Would highly recommend to make reservations on weekends."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have been coming here for years. I have never experienced terrible service. My food is always delicious. I can actually be found here at least once a week for lunch. Speaking of lunch, I had to write a review because they recently added more seating. Jackpot!!! The staff has always been accommodating for large groups without reservations but the new renovations are AWESOME. The round table makes you feel like a knight. They made the waiting area larger and moved it away from the doorway. You can actually get in and out now, without saying excuse me a dozen times. This restaurant is popular and I recommend a reservation for special occasions and large parties (7+. Service is exceptionally speedy.   Try anything on the menu. You will be pleased. Yes, anything, even the specials. I challenge you to eat there soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for our anniversary dinner; we chose to try it due to our normal Thai place being closed on Monday's(Bangkok Thai-Mayfield Road-Lyndhurst). Ordered green and red curry both 2 out of 3 star heat level; not very good. On a scale of 1-10 on curry dishes it was maybe a 3 or 4, there was a marked lack of basil, the spice and seasoning wasn't there and it had an unusual sweetness to it not normal to coconut milk curry dishes and lastly they add cow based half and half into the curry to finish them! Yuck! We asked several questions before ordering our appetizers(shrimp spring rolls and tempura vegetables) to ensure they contained no dairy and explained our allergy, one would assume that the server would then also ensure that she further advised us of any other items we may be ordering that contain dairy! Nope, must not have crossed her mind, I'll chalk that one up to my fault for not being more sure to confirm. It wasn't a busy evening at all we were there at 8pm and maybe two other tables were seated. A few other things to note, when we walked in and a not so pleasant smell hit us right away that almost made us do an about face and leave(smelled like musty or dirty carpets), secondly there were several people working, of those people there that night there was one young lady who was just sat at the register playing on her phone the whole time, I never actually saw her move to do anything, my wife and I just though that was weird. Service, well I can see what several people had said in the past about poor customer service skills, they aren't the best. All of the other reviews about poor service or so so food are true and consistent with our visit, maybe try it if your favorite Thai spot is closed!"}
{"text":"Waiters were extremely  unprofessional at this place and the owner didn't seem to care about it. I saw that lot of reviewers also complained about the same thing in their reviews.I have visited a lot of restaurants throughout the world but it was first time I have seen such atrocious behavior. Overall food was ok and service is extremely poor."}
{"text":"I love this place . From the food , service, atmosphere, to parking lot . Whenever I come here I usually get the chicken sauté, beef sauté, shrimp in a blanket, and Tom yum soup as appetizers and for main course country style Pad Thai , basil fried rice , Penang curry, tamarind duck, and crazy noodles . U can't forget the Thai tea !"}
{"text":"They serve really great pad thai! The house version has chicken and shrimp. It is very tasty.  Have only tried one other thing, and it was good. I keep going back for pad thai. Always has a great lunch crowd.  If you want a good meal, try this place...a bit pricy...the only down spot!"}
{"text":"Well,   we have had dinner here several times now and all I can say is that the food is fantastic!  It is always very fresh, and the sauces are wonderful.  I have had their Thai Style Basil which was wonderful.  Tried several of their curry dishes, and last night for dinner tried a totally different dish (Pine Nut Chicken) and it was fabulous.  My son had Mango Chicken in a curry sauce (which I tried) and all I can say is Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.  Wonderful restaurant.  They are definitely one of my favorites.  If you go, have the summer rolls, or their spinach pot stickers as both are wonderful.  Next time I'm going to try something different, and I am hoping that it will be soon."}
{"text":"I don't very often give five stars. That tells you how good this place is.  Fantastic Thai food!  I wish they were located in my home neighborhood.  They have a great menu with a lot of traditional Thai dishes that are exceptionally prepared. For example, the Summer Rolls are so fresh it's like little bites of summer.  The Thai Basil Chicken, which is always a favorite for me, is probably the best I've ever had.  They have a lot of seafood and curry dishes on the menu that I'd live to try, so I will be back!  Service is very good too."}
{"text":"What a find!  I came here because I was tired and hungry after the long trip to Cleveland for work, and I wanted a yummy hot meal before I checked into my hotel. This was delicious! Service was quick and friendly, prices were decent, and the pad thai was excellent! Will you open a location in Dallas please?"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant . We do not live near here and whenever we are shopping in the area , dinner here is a MUST . Food is always a fresh and so tasty . The only thing from preventing 5 stars is the noise level within the restaurant ."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely unprofessional at this restaurant. I have visited lot of restaurants throughout USA but it was first time I have seen such atrocious behavior.  The y openly and arrogantly complained to my face about the tip I am not leaving for them. So they charged my card for 18% as tip without letting me know in advance, which is what they deserved.  The food was not so great and the service is extremely poor. Highly recommend to those people who want to give tip for such a food and service."}
{"text":"I cannot claim to be an expert on Thai food, but it know what I like, and this place is very \"zen\" like - by that I mean that no matter how busy they are, the service is always smooth, never stressed.  The quality is consistent, never had a bad meal there.  Wish I lived closer, would be there once a week!"}
{"text":"I  ordered the chili duck from the chefs special menu. I understand that the duck is supposed to be toasted until it's crunchy, but it doesn't mean that the duck has to be overcooked. The flavor was good but the meat was fairly dry. Generally speaking, it's an ok place, I could have rated it four stars if my food had been served faster and my water had been refilled in time"}
{"text":"Eat here every time I'm in Cleveland.  Great food.  Service is great and place is pretty classy."}
{"text":"Great fair to eat!  Had the Tofu Tamarind - very flavorful, not spicy.  Brown rice to accompany the meal.  Wait staff very friendly and cheerful.  White wine sangria with papaya and strawberries hit the spot.  Large window opened to capture the breeze.  Reminded me of restaurants in California where you can eat outside"}
{"text":"Good food! Very accommodating to my dietary needs (no fish sauce, no bean sprouts, no peanuts.)"}
{"text":"Always great food and very good service. We eat here a lot never been disappointed. Very consistent always good love the appetizers and soups. Fast as you order you don't wait long for your appetizer or meal even when the place is packed. Go try you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I have ordered Pad Thai maybe 5 or 6 times in a row. Unfortunately, the consistency is not happening. Three out of the five times, it was outstanding. The other two times is was just OK. I don't understand why it isn't outstanding every time - is it because of the different chefs? But shouldn't they train the chefs so there is just one way to cook it? Consistency should be the key."}
{"text":"Green curry is my favorite thai dish, and salmon is one of my favorite proteins, so the salmon green curry seemed like a perfect fit (I also haven't ever seen salmon as an option for curry).  Unfortunately, my standards for both are high and I found both parts of the dish to be lacking in flavor and just middle-of-the pack.  I also got the tofu wedges, which were also less-than-impressive.  I was there with a friend who always samples pad thai the first time he goes to a new Thai restaurant, and we both agreed that the pad thai was pretty good, above average for what we've both tried.  TL;DR Salmon green curry was average, tofu wedges were meh, pad thai was above-average, there's plenty better to try"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the meal here! This place has some of the best tasting Thai food. I heard that it was the old Mint Cafe, so I decided to take a detour up here after work. It was on a week night and was completely packed. The service was excellent. They had me seated and fed in under ten minutes. Since I work out in Solon, I will make my way north up 271 to eat here more when I feel the urge."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Cleveland. We have been going there often. Friendly service and food tastes amazing. I took family that are out of town there and they also loved the food. Our favorite is the country style pad thai."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice, the food is good, the service is quick and it is reasonably priced.  What else can you ask for?   It's perfect for lunch!"}
{"text":"Most appreciated the attention paid to the appetizers. Had the crab rolls (on special) and the vegetable tempura. Both simple, but exquisitely prepared and flavored. Not at all greasy.    Tried the Pad Thai and a special, Pad See-U. My wife worried that they'd be the same thing, but not at all. The Pad Thai was light and mild. The Pad See-U uses much wider, thicker noodles, broccoli and a spicier sauce. Both were very good.  Service was perfect. Decor seems more authentic and heartfelt than usual."}
{"text":"I just got home from Peppermint Thai and it will be my last time.  When I showed up to order dinner I placed an order for takeout with a man. He told the order to a woman who asked \"One dinner? Or two? Two?\" and then laughed. The man said \"one\" as she continued to laugh. But then I get home to find out the name they put on my order was \"FRT MAN\". Like seriously? You're not even trying to cover up you're insulting your customers?   Forget this place, I'll find other places in the area. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"An extensive menu. Wonderful, unique and healthy options. There are also vegetarian options. The place was rather busy and had it not been recommended to me I never would have noticed it tucked into a strip mall on a busy traffic circle. The food came out very very fast after we ordered and the waitress was very friendly and helping suggesting menu items. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! We regularly come here for lunch and dinner. Their dishes are always come out quickly, and the service is great. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. My favorites are the Crazy Noodle and Pad Thai Country Style. Make sure you arrive early or go on off-hours -- it can get really busy."}
{"text":"Always an amazing dinner or lunch.  We dine in often and get take out as well, since we live in the area.  I love the deep fried shrimp appetizer- this is better when dining in since it can get soggy if it waits too long or comes in contact with steam!  Great with sriracha!  Their garlic salmon is amazing, too!  So flavorful, with a crispy skin.   Lunch time is great for a curry dish!  I love the shrimp penang!  Good size, good flavor, a bit of heat, but not too much.  I always have leftovers, but everyone I eat with finishes or almost finishes their lunch!"}
{"text":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I pulled up, but pleasantly surprised.  Tucked in strip center, the decor is a little dated, but the service was top notch and food was quite good.  I had the spinach potstickers, which while flavorful, the noodle shell was a tad underdone.  Even with that, it was still good and well presented and plenty to eat.  I had the Coventry Rd Madness at the suggestion of my server.  Lots of good, well seasoned and cooked seafood.  Presentation was excellent.  No extra charge for brown rice (what' up with that anyway).  Since I'm rarely in town, probably won't be back, but would recommend to any Yelpers reading this review."}
{"text":"I enjoy having a Tai restaurant in the neighborhood.  Peppermint has good Tai food, the dining room is big and the wait staff is friendly.  They offer take out and lunch portions and prices.   I have mainly used this place for take out.  I really like the crazy noodles, the basil fried rice, the pad tai, chicken satay and the Siam rolls.  The only reason I didn't rate this spot a 4 Star restaurant is I think they play it too safe w the flavors.  I wish the flavors were a little bit bolder.   Still tasty non the less, I will continue to use Peppermint as a take out joint."}
{"text":"I used to absolutely LOVE this place for Thai. My recent visit was extremely disappointing and I do not think I will be back. I ordered crazy noodles one with only shrimp (no chicken) medium spicy and another crazy noodles with chicken for carryout. After coming home to eat my meal, I realized the spice levels were done vice versa, shrimp extremely over-cooked, and gummy rice noodles. I called to get my order fixed, she said bring it back and we will make you a new one. I drove the 20 minutes back and gave back my food ( to receive the new ones. She decided to \"fix\" the order by not adding any sauce and just simply giving me siracha on the side. I was extremely disappointed because she did not listed to what I wanted and strata is not the sauce for crazy noodles. At this point I decided I wanted a refund and a refund was given. The worst part was the woman gave me no apologies about the incident and it seemed as if she was bothered to have to fix it. Very rude and disrespectful."}
{"text":"Coming from California, a land of a huge variety of authentic Asian cuisine, I wasn't expecting much of a Thai restaurant in this area.  But I was proven wrong. They make some awesome curry! The menu looks great; real good variety of dishes. Overall, very impressed. And since I am now living in the area will definitely keep them in mind when I feel like eating some Thai food."}
{"text":"This is a very good Thai restaurant. The soups were flavorful, as were the green curry and mango curry we had as entrees. Could have been spicier, but I'll know to ask for next time. Pretty dining room, prompt and attentive service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here once, but I think this will be my favorite Thai restaurant in Cleveland area. First of all, the restaurant is quite large and relatively clean with a lot of Thai decor. The service was pretty good. We tried Siam spring rolls as an appetizer and Pad Thai country style and Lamb Shank as our entrees.   Spring rolls were tasty. It is made in the restaurant, so the veggies in the roll seemed fresh and recognizable. I especially liked the fact that it had taro inside.   The pad thai country style was good. Ingredients were fresh, which I tell by the taste of shrimps. The flavor was right on, not too salty. But, the thickness of noodles was relatively thin, so it was less chewy.   Lamb shank was very good. The size of lamb was reasonable for the price. The meat was cooked to fall-off-the-bone. The Massaman curry and potatoes paired well with the meat.   Also, the presentation of every dish was surprisingly good, which is not commonly seen in local Thai restaurants. I think the overall prices were reasonable.  I would come back for other dishes."}
{"text":"Its still 5 stars and my favorite dish is the Under the Sea?  Its the seafood curry I mentioned in the other review. Outstanding."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Thai food in Cleveland.. Not even just in Cleveland the best I've ever had!! The service is always great! Everything is always so fresh. Its very easy to eat \"right\" here. Theyve always catered to any health restrictions. And the phad Thai.. Omg never ever had I've had better! If you're in the area go you won't regret it!! Promise!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Service was mediocre but the quality and presentation of the food was really great. I ordered the basil chicken and they even allowed me to add a side of peanut sauce to it which is always nice. The portions were a great size and I had enough for leftover lunch the next day too. I would definitely return although I'm not sure when I'd be in the Pepper Pike area again."}
{"text":"Omg- this place is amazing. It is one of our favorite Thai restaurants around and it is always great- no matter when you go. We always go and get bubble tea and it is the best one around - my personal favorite is the Thai bubble tea and my kids like the mango. As for the food, so good! I love the crazy noodle dishes and the Pad Thai has to be one of the tastiest ones around. My son Loves to get the basil fried rice and while I like it, it's not as great as the Pad Thai. Also, the chicken Satay appetizer is quite tasty and a fan favorite for our entire family.  Be warned, this place is always busy and if you don't go early or get a reservation, you May not get it. The to go is the thing here and Something that we usually do as it's tiring battling the crowds. Overall, it's quite a wonderful place to dine in and suggest it to everyone."}
{"text":"Love it! My friend and I went there for dinner before working out and the dishes were just the right amount. I had their duck special (something written on the blackboard in front of the restaurant), it was fried duck with some veggies and in red curry which was very delicious (you can't go wrong on curry). My friend had beef in green curry which was good too. The only issue was it seems the owner was renovating the entrance of the restaurant so it looks like the place was closed and there was this construction everywhere. I would remind everyone to be careful going in and out and do not hurt yourself."}
{"text":"My go to spot for Thai food in Cleveland! I usually order the country style pad Thai (comes with chicken, shrimp, tofu) and it's not too spicy, for me anyways. I've also tried the peppermint Thai fried rice and pad see ew which are also delicious! I've never sat in and usually order takeout but the place is nicely decorated!"}
{"text":"The food at Peppermint Thai is amazing!! They are very quick and efficient with take out orders.  Order the pad Thai country style, mango fried rice, crazy noodles and all of the curry meals. The seafood dinners are also really wonderful."}
{"text":"Its such a shame to rate this restaurant so low because of the service.Amazing food with poor service. I have been to this place a couple of times, i never had a pleasant experience here with the staff.I had to walk out of the restaurant last time because they refused to change my table in a completely empty restaurant. I wish the staff is more friendly, i would like to go here more often."}
{"text":"I love the food. We frequent a few thai places and I really like Peppermint. The basil pasta is amazing. I always want to order multiple servings just so that I could have some for the rest of the week.   Friendly staff, great service, and excellent food."}
{"text":"okay Thai food for quick take-out. the summer rolls were great, but my curry was lacking flavor. I'll try them again and actually sit down and dine..maybe the experience would be better than eating in the front seat of my car."}
