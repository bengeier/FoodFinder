{"text":"An institution! A great place to relax, knock back some brews and make new friends. A very friendly and accommodating staff, decent prices and great food."}
{"text":"Our second time visiting this place, first time 18months ago. This time was just as good as the last. Affordable beer and good food. Service is great. It's not a fancy place but it's the best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"12.50 pitchers of Molson ex, staff are very friendly and welcoming and really good pub food."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night cause it was right next to the hotel.   Lot of college kids which was fine but it was basically all guys . It was crowded and smelled like a skeevy frat house which is basically what it looked like too.   Can't complain about $1 beers though.  That made things easier but after about an hour and a half of being in the crowd we decided to venture to other places.   It's good for a bit but its not destination that warrants the trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Nice renovation. Service was fine. I asked the server for an add-on to my order THREE times but to no avail the server forgot. Staff are quite nice and respectful. No complaints other than that. Their $5 menu isn't bad at all either. Would recommend if you're looking for a place to get a drink with a friend and wind down."}
{"text":"The price of a pitcher of beer was very fair for the area. Beers in the area can cost anywhere from $6-8 for a single beer. $6 for a micro brew at brewtopia and up to $8 for a bud light at most places elsewhere on Crescent. Their pitchers at this place were $17 for a micro of Richard's White. The atmosphere was very pub-ish. I enjoyed the place and the beer prices."}
{"text":"Bonne ambiance, sympathique et le jeudi: drinks Ã  1$ :))"}
{"text":"One of my favorite \"Go-To\" bar. Staff is AMAZINGLY friendly, prices are good, place has this rough aspect but is quite clean in the same time. Clients all seem nice and fresh. Very student friendly! Full on recommendation!  Nice rooftop patio and dive bar appeal. Quite decent food. Muy bueno :)"}
{"text":"Came here for an UYE (cards against humanity night) and was surprised that I'd never heard of this pub before!   Seating is plentiful and service was quick on a busy night but like many pubs in the city, there's nothing very special about this one. Food was ok as were the drinks. The main negative was that it's super super loud in there making it very hard to speak to those you're with.  Would I go back? Maybe... but unlikely! Check it out if you're a pub person though - you might enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Asked the hotel concierge for a decent place to grab a burger & beer. While their recommendation was Le Warehouse, I wasn't going to wait to line in 28 degree temperatures. Walked a block down & saw this eclectic basement bar. Was throughly impressed that I ate there again the next day.   First of all the the food was excellent. The $5 meals are a steal. The burgers are In-n-out sized with a huge side of order of fries included in the special. If you aren't on a calorie count, go with the Homer Simpson burger. (Cheeseburger served on a glazed donut instead of a bun...it's glorious).   There is also a daytime beer pitcher special that is worth checking out. The bar staff were awesome with a wide range of personalities and I enjoyed the atmosphere. There are tables for large groups, dates & dive bar type seating as well. This place has it all."}
{"text":"This place has recently turned into our new hang out place! Bartenders are very friendly. 3 shots for $11. $12.50 for pitchers every day (before 11pm i think). Haven't tried the food yet though!"}
{"text":"This is a newly renovated location of Mad Hatter's I recently checked out. It is larger than the old location with a lounge-leather seats to the left as well as tables in the main area. Decor is more dive bar styled. The lighted trees that were a nice touch along with the sprayed painted slogans in white and black up near the bar. There are pool tables as well in the back. The bathrooms are small but clean. The music was kind of loud for a Monday evening.  They serve food and drinks. I didn't order anything except for a stout that was 7$. I thoroughly enjoyed the free popcorn though! Their alcohol selection is basic but fair- come here for beer, the whiskey I'll leave to other locations!"}
{"text":"Terrible bar. Terrible bartender. The place is dirty & the tvs suck."}
{"text":"$5 food which is absolutely delicious, great cheap drink specials and cheap pool... and we came here on a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Madhatter's is a Montreal staple. It's moved around a lot but has never shut down, it doesn't matter whether you still go or not, it is always full.  It's in the center of downtown, at the lower end of Crescent street. You can expect a lot of tourist, college, and/or university kids to take up most of the bar. Feels like you're at a frat house at times, who am I kidding... ALL the time. It's rowdy, busy, crammed, but the inexpensive beers make it tolerable if you're up to it. The earlier you go, the better your chances are of getting a table or a place on the bar to sit at. Don't forget to check out the rooftop terrace, which is really nice to hangout at in the summer time when it gets especially hot and stuffy indoors."}
{"text":"I loved this place when I visited Canada (5 years ago...)  Don't know if it's changed because I haven't been back since then, but I loved the rooftop patio, and the dive bar appeal.  Also, heard the stupidest pick-up line here. \"You can call me T.I, cause you can  have whatever you like\".  The toilets were weird.  I mean, I'm American, but the flusher thing was a friggin' string.  And they had more graffiti in them than toilet paper."}
{"text":"If you want a nice place to have a drink with friends go elsewhere. Mediocre beer selection at best. It's no wonder this bar is in a tourist heavy area. Locals know that it takes more than Coors light and Jack Daniels to stand out. This is the Nickelback of bars."}
{"text":"The Madhatter Burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had! Awesome draft beer selection, full bar and friendly staff. If you're looking for a chill place to kick back relax and enjoy conversation with friends I would recommend the Madhatter.... try the Madhatter burger, it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"I was going to give this place 4 stars, but what the hell? I can't think of a reason not to give it 5.   Madhatter's or just Hatter's as people like to call it, is a small eclectic pub, with a homey atmosphere. I love it's many strange paintings and pictures hanging on the walls, as well as the stripper pole, which can be great fun when your friend is smashed, and you convince them to give you a dance. One of the best features i think, is the music. They don't play the standard billboard chart hits, and mix it up with some rock and older hits that will hit your nostalgia bone. Group sing alongs are quite common.  You can't tell by looking at the place, but they actually serve some decent food and at very decent prices. The beer is always flowing, as are the test tube shots. I recommend coming here to spend a night with friends and a few pitchers of beer, you won't regret it! Although you might in the morning."}
{"text":"If you're an American or English-Canadian wanting a good time in a great new city, why on earth would you go to the one place that is the most like what you could experience back home?  That is the question I've asked myself all too many times.  Listen, I'm one of the most obnoxious people on earth, but this place brings the obnox-o-meter to a whole new level.  Trying to have a conversation in here with a friend sometimes feels like trying to study ancient Egyptian algebra during a World War 1 artillery barrage.  Except the artillery barrage sounds like men with backwards hats chest bumping (the friendly way and the more aggressive variety) and yelling random shit like, \"BRYAN!!!\" and \"Yeah, bro!\"  Full disclosure - quite honestly, I hate this bar more than any other in Montreal.  I've gone dozens of times (with friends who insisted on it) over the past 6 years and have tried - I promise you, I tried - to have a good time, but rarely ever have.  It's just got that nauseating je-ne-sais-quoi to it.  The only thing forcing me to give it two stars instead of one is that they serve beer and they don't murder you with the prices.  What I perceive to be an overall douchey atmosphere is what brings it down so low.  Different strokes for different folks, I guess.  I'd suggest trying out Foufounes Electriques, Brutopia, Saint-Sulpice, Hurley's, or anywhere else for that matter before this place."}
{"text":"So I guess this place moved. Last time I had been was for a Harry Potter Trivia Night and it was such a weird place. It wasn't big enough to accommodate the crowds and was really rickety.   Really glad they opened this new location. It's neat! Lots of space and comfy seating, free popcorn, a 5$ menu with Mac and cheese, everything a Justine needs to feel at home in a pub ( I don't drink so there's gotta be something else they offer).   Our second Cards Against Tournament UYE was hosted here and it was great! We had two booths reserved and it was in a circular arrangement so it was perfect to play and eat.   Ordered the Mac and cheese before people started arriving and it was standard. It came with a piece of toast which I found puzzling.   Wish the popcorn came with small bowls instead of paper bags to carry back to your table.   Our waitress had a bit of trouble with our large group because her computer was mixing up the receipts. So that part was a bit messy, but not at all her fault.   But other than that, the event was a hit and I loved the venue!"}
{"text":"picture yourself in montreal, on a first date, everything is going right and it's getting towards the end of the night.  you bring the girl back to your hotel right? no, under those circumstances the madhatter is a perfectly acceptable stop.   located on rue cresent it's in the \"american\" part of the town.  most people in there speak english, they play snoop dog, sublime and other late 90's hits.  it's 2 stories, with a pool table and foosball upstairs as well as outdoor seating.  it gets bumping even on weeknights and pitchers are pretty cheap.  it's not the fanciest place and definitely not somewhere you want to start the night.  but if you want to find out if she can kick back, throw down and shoot some pool around rowdy people make this your pit stop before the home stretch."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with good music, pool table, ping pong and Jenga. Loud, fun music. Good spot on St. Patty's day. Food is fair. It's bar food."}
{"text":"when we first went to Montreal two years ago, we were thinking of going in here for their New Year's Eve. buuuuut...$20 cover charge my ass, so we trudged on and found a place with no cover and $10 pitchers. oh well...  however, on the return tour, we swung by and had a good time.  it definitely is a renovated house, cause this place is HUGE! several floors, a lot of space, even a back patio drinking area! nothing like outdoor drinking with good music playing - Rob Zombie, Stone Temple Pilots, Iron Maiden, and more.  decent selection of beers, and they were inexpensive. definitely reminded me of a frat house so far as layout, with the atmosphere of a dive bar.   random sampling of the crowd included - three guys who are apparently in a band called \"Shit N Dales\". they were dressed as the Blue, Green, and Pink Rangers from \"Power Rangers\". - they were sitting with a girl who kept yelling out the C-word - there was also a crew of tattooed and pierced punks  overall, not a great spot, but an electronic jukebox, friendly bartenders, several pool tables, and a young, college-age crowd make this a decent place to either start the night or wind it down.   can you dig it?"}
{"text":"Came by here around lunch for a pitcher and some food.  What I liked about this place is that they served real pub food. That means cheap, good food with large portions.  The bartender was really sweet, she was chatting with three regulars when we came in and approached us as soon as we were seated.   I was surprised to see that the menu carried more than your average cheeseburger and fries. The server recommended the Elvis Burger which was a combination of a beef patty with bacon, cheddar cheese, onion rings and peanut butter.   I was delighted by the presentation of the burger which was stacked high and appropriately skewered in place. What made it even better was the fact that it came with a big bowl of poutine and a side of coleslaw.  The burger was delicious and the poutine was good too, although the gravy was a little sweeter than what I'm accustomed to.   The feel of the place is very laid back, it has lots of cool vintage decor and overall felt very much like a classic pub."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and the staff was super friendly. Our waitress was obviously harried but she did well coming back repeatedly to make sure we were taken care of and that matters to me. I also appreciated they reserved a huge section for our large group.  Drinks were good albeit we had an incident with one pitcher of sangria which was off but they replaced it without hesitation.  I ate a club sandwich and onion rings. The rings were amazing, perfectly done. The club sandwich was the standard fare. I recommend using better chicken for it, if you're open for advice and perhaps different mayo. I'd love if you'd cater to different types of mayo as well. But all in all, a decent meal with a good price.  Music is a bit loud in the area we were in and not really necessary so I'll dock a point for that.  All in all, I'd totally be back."}
{"text":"Eh, the bartender we got was rude. Fun ambiance though. Young crowd. I probably wouldn't spend any more of my money there."}
{"text":"Oh Madhatter, you hold so many blurry memories. This is a great dive bar with decent pub food, cheap drinks, and the perfect atmosphere for a sloppy evening. What more could my 18 year old self ask for? I don't remember most of my evenings at Hatters, which at the time seemed like a great thing. It's a solid spot with friendly staff and a dope rooftop patio, definitely worth stopping in for a cold beer and some grub."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced cocktails. Had Oversized jenga and other games to play while you drink. Went for the $1 beer special but was told that was discontinued."}
{"text":"Last summer I went to Montreal with a friend, our first night there we came upon this pub, it looked a little sketchy at first but once we went in we found the drinks were cheap and not bad and the staff was very nice. We returned several times, throughout our stay and fell in love with the place, the food was great, we had Gladburger's and poutine, you can't go to Canada and not try poutine, The bar itself had a great vibe, odd paintings, a jukebox and some cool steps leading to the upper level. I would definitely recommend this place if you're into dive bars with great food and friendly people."}
{"text":"Just as cheap and delicious as the old Mad Hatters but with all the aesthetic of a brand new and \"hip\" joint! Same old staff (and quite importantly, still Eric in the kitchen) with a new look to match their attempts to draw in the younger crowd. Pool table and stripper pole included!"}
{"text":"We heard some good things about this place and it didn't disappoint at all. It was a Sunday night and the place was still packed late at night to our surprise since we expect bars/pubs to be pretty dead during this time of the week and day. But atmosphere was still very lively with good music and not too full where seats are are still plenty available.   The bartender was extremely easy on the eyes but a little short on the head in terms of intelligence. You know that's the case when she brought us a pitcher but asked us if we needed some glasses.   We also order a few pitchers of Ricard's Red at employee's prices or however you like to call it. Think it was like $7 or $8 bucks for a regular pitcher. Also there's a hockey count down sign counting down the days to where the Montreal Canadian play their first game. Gotta love any place that is that much into Hockey, but then again this is Canada!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had. The food was so bad and the service was horrible. Never going back. Go to \"The Warehouse\" down the street if you want the best 5$ meals in Montreal."}
{"text":"Me and my buddies came out to Montreal for our annual summer weekend. We almost always stay at the Quality inn on Crescent st . We never knew this basement pub was there. We stumbled across this place looking for a couple of cold ones and cheap eats , we where not disappointed the staff was awesome , music great , beer cold and you absolutely need to try the Homer Simpson burger for just $5 with fries ( pic shown )"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and drink beer, you can play pool, the staff is nice, good music."}
{"text":"Found this little place when we were looking for a place for happy hour. It's right on Crescent street and just below ground level. Very casual bar style decor with pool tables in the back and lots of bar seating.   Although there was no happy hour per say they do have a $5 food menu and 4 shots for $10 (!!!!) which the lovely bartender allowed us to change into 2 double mixed drinks.   We had the wings which came with fries for $5 and two double gin and sodas for $20. Could not be more satisfied with our food, drinks and service.   This will definitely be a joint I will revisit each time I'm back in Montreal.   Oh and did I mention they have $3 cereal bowls after 10:30pm? Love love love."}
{"text":"Our last day in Montreal and looking for something reasonably priced, Madhatter did not disappoint. Probably one of the most affordable places I've been to in Canada.   Walking in, it looks like your typical pub, but it is truly better than the \"average\" impression it gave me. I got a \"Glad\" burger and poutine as a side (impressed more so by the lack of up-charge for poutine). Most dishes are under $10 and there is a $6 specials menu which is really impressive. I got a few pints of Export ($4 each) and I found that extremely reasonable for anywhere I've been in Canada.   The young lady working the bar is very friendly and sociable, quite funny as well! Certainly a great hangout spot for those on a budget."}
{"text":"Great value. $7.50 for a pint while $5 for burger & fries. Heavy rock/metal music that gave the underground space a cool vibe."}
{"text":"very awesome dive bar. the staff is super friendly. although we were their as tourists one of the things I liked about this place was that it wasn't flooded with tourists like the rest of the bars in downtown. we met a group of friendly locals and had some friendly bouts in billiards all night. good beers on tap. id definitely recommend the \"mad &noisy IPA\"."}
{"text":"It's been a year since I have been there....but, good times, good times.   Sittin' on the rooftop terrace surrounded by chicken wire, getting bopped on the head by beach balls, drinking pitchers, chatting with whoever...makes for a dive-bar, who gives a crap let's get more beer kinda night!   Think I am way overdue for another round!"}
{"text":"J'ai dÃ©couvert le Madhatter l'Ã©tÃ© passÃ© par hasard et depuis j'y vais au moins un jeudi par mois. L'ambiance est excellente, la musique trÃ¨s bonne (Rock Alternatif et Vieux Rock) et les prix sont trÃ¨s abordables. Il y aussi un vaste choix de repas/appetizers (Burgers, Nachos, Frites Cajuns). Je vous conseille particuliÃ¨rement les jeudi pour l'ambiance jusqu'Ã  3h mais si vous voulez Ãªtre tranquille durant une belle journÃ©e la terrasse est parfaite."}
{"text":"Honestly, I walked in here not expecting much. I was on the hunt for cheap food and booze for my last night in Montreal, and I was really pleasantly surprised. I got chicken fingers and a burger for $5 and it was actually quite good, and my drink was inexpensive and strong. The bartender was friendly and attentive. It's definitely got a dive bar vibe, the music is loud and the patrons can be a little rowdy. It's a fun place, but not somewhere to go if you want a quiet date night."}
{"text":"I'm sure I would've really loved this place if I were 18 and taking a vacation over the border since that seemed to be the majority of the clientele when I visited. Unfortunately, this place just gave me flashbacks to college.   Pretty divey with some cheap (but weak af) drinks. Some other reviews mention the food being good, but I didn't get to try any. Might be better on an off night where the pool table is free and the freshmen clear out."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy weekend while visiting Montreal, great food and drinks. Loved the bartender and server. Good deals on food and shots. Try the smoked meat sandwich."}
{"text":"Interesting place to say the least. Crowd was good and lively and the beer was priced fairly. They have a foozball table and a good selection of music."}
{"text":"I like this bar. They got some good cheap eats and pitchers. I know quite a few people who go to this bar. This bar, along Fats and Andrews are my top 3 bars in downtown Montreal.  I had many memories in this bar and saw many friends pass out here. lol  This bar has an outside terrasse in the back and front and there's also 2 floors here. They also 12 dollar steak fries."}
{"text":"I finally visited this new version of Mad Hatters and I honestly really enjoyed it !  The Decor inside is definitely a huge step up from the old Mad Hatters , more up to date and definitely quirky but still fun and comfortable. The energy inside is till the same old relaxed and fun atmosphere that I remembered. We went as a pretty big group on a Wednesday night and were able to be seated right away. Our server was very friendly and attentive , he check in on us frequently and was definitely a part of the enjoyable experience. Also, they have lots of happy hour specials for Cheap drinks and food which is always nice, especially when you're just looking for a fun night out with friends without breaking the bank.  This is by no means a fancy/gourmet bar , but they have lounge-y areas to sit as a group (They even have Jenga), A pool table , lots of seating for groups and also smaller tables in quieter area  if you're just two or three people etc..  I can safely say I would recommend this place for a 5@7 or any casual outing to grab a drink , and I will be going back again as well."}
{"text":"I preferred this bar when it used to be at it's original location near de Maissoneuve, but it still hosts a very interesting crown, and the beer is cold... so what more can you ask for.  The place looks like a bit of a dive, but it's a comfortable dive, so if your in for a good student / blue collar kinda night this place will be right up your alley."}
{"text":"Came to Montreal on a senior week trip, and we accidentally stumbled into this pub and it was the best night we ever had. Drinks are amazing and cheap! They play great music and have pool tables and giant jenga! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great hidden bar with a great atmosphere. Pool, ping pong, and Jenga kept us entertained for hours. Food is cheap but good and beer is reasonably priced. The margarita shots were cheap but had very minimal alcohol content. The staff was all friendly and helpful. Nice find in Montreal!"}
{"text":"PremiÃ¨rement la biÃ¨re est pas cher. J'ai adorÃ© cette emplacement, j'aime bien les endroits trash et rock. Belle terrasse. Le madhater est dans le top 3. BiÃ¨re rock party c'est Ã§a 8.5/10"}
{"text":"For any traveling Americans who want good service and cheap food, or any locals who want a chill evening out, this is the place!!! My friends and I came up for new years weekend and had such a great time that we went back to Mad Hatter nearly every night. Each night we were served by the same woman (I believe her name was Elena but I'm bad with names) and she was absolutely incredible. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The fact that the majority of their food menu is $5 is bonkers and at first glance a little terrifying, but everything we got was delicious! And some of the items even come with sides?! Would come here again whether I was on a budget or not. Also someone put on Fat Lip by Sum 41 while we were there so that was a +1 in my book"}
{"text":"Ma premiÃ¨re expÃ©rience au Madhatter a Ã©tÃ© il y a quelques annÃ©es de Ã§a aprÃ¨s un concert au Centre Bell. C'Ã©tait un soir en plein milieu de semaine, il faisait pas trop beau, ni chaud et on voulait quelque chose de prÃ¨s, pas cher, et des drinks! On est donc allÃ© au Madhatter par hasard. Depuis, j'y suis seulement allÃ©e les fois oÃ¹ j'allais y rejoindre quelqu'un. J'aime bien les pubs relaxes et pas compliquÃ©s, mais celui-lÃ  Ã  plutÃ´t l'air de tomber en morceaux. C'est plutÃ´t le genre de place oÃ¹ il fait bien y aller plus tard quand on remarque moins les imperfections parce qu'il fait noir. C'est dommage parce que les drinks ne sont pas trop chers, le staff est gentil et courtois, puis la terrasse Ã  l'arriÃ¨re est beaucoup plus tranquille que celles des autres pubs d'en face."}
{"text":"Writing this review two months after the fact. Better late than never!  Mad Hatter Pub is an awesome dive bar in downtown MontrÃ©al that was recommended to us by the bartenders up the street at Dundees. We googled the pub while we were sitting at the bar and it was under the category \"Montreal's Top 10 Best Bad Decision Bars\" I knew we were in the right place. On a Saturday night there were people crowd surfing, pounding back shots and just truly enjoying life without crossing the line of psychotic-rowdy.  The whole place is a decent size, decor is unique. Bar is long. It's underground so it has that nice, dark vibe. Pool tables and ping pong table available. DJ killed it on Saturday night. He didn't play the typical top 40, but instead brought in some great nostalgia tunes that ranged from pop to rock and many other genres. Awesome! There's a digital juke box for those interested in listening to something else when there's no DJ. Prices were decent and we both stuck to beers the entire weekend except when other patrons bought us shots (very common as it happened to us a lot downtown - must be the MontrÃ©al way)!  We went for a quick weekend getaway for my boyfriend's 30th and this was by far our favorite place to go to every night as it was right next to our hotel. We met all types of people and everyone was so friendly. We left with new friends, great conversation and lots of laughs with other patrons. Every night there were always other patrons who talked to us for hours. Truly lovely people with big hearts and common interests. Bartenders Matt, Justin, Simon and Dylan were all wonderful. We had another bartender our final night (didn't catch his name - thought I heard someone say \"James\") but he was great too!  Go in and have a good time; you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Beware, you could get your phone stolen here and the management is aware. Someone took mine and when I asked the bartender about it, she was oddly defensive and said \"i was just in the kitchen and didn't see it in there\"...I never accused anyone in the kitchen so why would she say that? I talked to management and he proceeded to tell me that their camera system was down and that this sort of thing happens often. Another bartender had hers stolen twice. Wouldn't you think to try and resolve this problem or at least warn people? Other than that, the food was decent and the service was good until that unfortunate event. They were also very understaffed so be prepared to wait 20 mins to be served"}
{"text":"So on our first night here we spotted the line out the door of fraternity type kids waiting to get in.  We skipped that night but gave it another chance a few nights later.  No line, no attitude, just a bunch of really cool people.  The bartender Russ was awesome.  He made us feel right at home and cracked a few jokes with us.  He even introduced us to bar curling.  That's right, same rules as on the ice but they play it on the bar with a full beer mug.  Closest to the end of the bar without going over wins. Everything else is typical of a college type bar but it's the people who work here that gave it the 4th star for us. Thanks Russ! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best burger in mtl! Great draft beers and cool atmosphere....Matt at the bar was very nice."}
{"text":"You have to put this on your list of pubs to try when in town.   Super nice staff!!  They had some great draft choices, which seems to be hard to find for some reason.   What makes this place a great place is the atmosphere. Cool stuff on the walls plus some unique decorations behind the bar.   They have a couple of pool tables and ping ping should you need to be reminded how bad you are at these things.   The food looked real food. We only drank, but would try it next time."}
