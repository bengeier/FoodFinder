{"text":"i have been coming here for years and i liked it before and still like it now after the new menu.



$27  5/5 We got the table side ceasir salade.  Always refreshing to have an old school menu item revitized. 
All the ingredients are there for yiu to see and they build and mix it there in front of you. 

$ 21 oyster Rockefeller     - ok since I was expecting more


$59 bone in rib steak   medium rear   amazing cooked to my request.  Nice tendor perfectly aged.


It is more expensive then keg for sure and maybe that is why I don't give it a full five stars.     It is for a mature crowd ."}
{"text":"For years Peter's has been our celebration place. From birthdays, and graduations to anniversaries, Peter's is special enough for them all.

Small, intimate, dimly lit and large portions, with service that can't be beat. Everything that a great steakhouse should be."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses i've ever been to, fantastic service and excellent quality of food! highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is our regular steak house.  About once every 6 weeks.  In the 5 or 6 years we've been going, I can honestly say we've never had a bad meal.
The Peter's cut of prime rib is very large, always cooked perfectly.  No way I could finish it.  Now I just order the regular cut, and I'm still left with MEAT.
Caesar salad is very good.
Yes, the interior is dated, but that's okay once you dig in.
Try the shrimp, also very large.

Not sure why others say its not as good as Toronto steak houses, I think its right up there."}
{"text":"In Markham for a business meeting and a coworker found Peters on Yelp. 

I live in the Washington, D.C. area and frequent high end steak houses and will pick this place over most of them every day of the week. Better executed meal than anything I've had at Morton's or Ruth's Chris in years. Had the Filet Neptune (filet mignon topped with lobster, asparagus and hollandaise) and it was superb. 

Wine selection isn't so diverse, but there are gems on the list if you know what to look for.  

Also, I'm the father of a 2 YO and although I get the irritation over lack of kid friendliness, some places just aren't and shouldn't be.  I won't begrudge this place for it. Not the right atmosphere. Besides, there are ten thousand other places in a short radius to choose from that are kid friendly. If you've got enough time to bitch about it on Yelp you've got enough time to find another place to eat. 

One last thing - the ma√Ætre d is a mountain of a man who could win a Gene Simmons look alike contest without trying. I hope if I come back he's in the full makeup getup."}
{"text":"Love this place, we go there for special occasions, never disappoints, the appetizers are incredible and always fresh, raw oysters are delicate, Cesar salad is made in front of you, the stake Diane is to die for, always delicious."}
{"text":"My experience match to all reviews posted.  
I was impress with this resturant.  

First impression:  old school - similar to The David Duncan House or The School.  

However, the service and quality of food were excellent.  Way better than the 2 resturants mention above!  

 My husband reserved in advance and told them the occasion was for our wedding anniversary.  They gave us a slice of chocolate cake with happy anniversary on the plate.

And every lady in the room get a rose at the end of the night, I think it was very sweet.  

My husband order prime rib and I order Halibut (I just couldn't see myself finishing their steak - smallest portion was 8 oz).  

One suggestion for them will be to provide smaller portion on the menu, LOL. 

Hidden gem in Markam, MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Amazing steakkkk... damnnn is soooo goood

Free garlic bread and olives/pickles

1) oyster rockefellar ($19) - nice and creamy sauce. oysters are fresh. you get 6 of these, thought i would only get like 3 or 4.
2) prime rib ($36) - amazing prime rib, one of the best I've had.
3) ribeye steak ($48) - nice and tender, simply amazing.

total came to like $110, was worth it :)"}
{"text":"So many reviews we have read have a similar message.  They have passed this restaurant by a hundred times because of the outside... we are no different.  After 6 years we finally decided to go for our anniversary.  SOOO glad we did.  They have comfy chairs and plenty of room to get to your table.    I very much enjoy the old time idea of table side service and Pete's does it top notch.  We began our meal with crab cakes and lobster bisque soup.  Full of crab, very tasty.  The soup was good but maybe a little salty for my taste but overall very nice.  Next came the table side Caesar salad.   Made to perfection.  There was so much we actually took some home.  As the peppercorn steak was 12 oz, my husband and I shared.  Sauce was made tableside for this.   Awesome taste and cooked to perfection.  And for dessert, we had table side banana's foster.  WHOO HOOO.  Finding a restaurant that makes this dessert is a treasure, but finding a restaurant that makes it this good, is a gold mine.  Made my night. As a surprise for our anniversary, they also brought out a complementary slice of chocolate cake with a Happy Anniversary message on it.     And finally, just because I could, I ordered a Spanish coffee.  Yep you guessed it prepared table side too.  I have never seen this before, (good and fun to watch).  All of this experience and fantastic food does come at a price, but well worth it.  To cap the night off, I was presented with a lovely rose.    Thank you Tom , George and the entire staff at Pete's.  You made our evening."}
{"text":"Visited Peter's for the first time tonight with my hubby. Exellent atmopshere, the owners Tom and George were great hosts. The servers were also great. 

Hubby ordered the oysters rockerfellar, loved them and even ordered a second one! George made us a ceasar salad at the table and it wad delicious. I had the filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly. He cream of chicken soup before the meal was superb also. Overall an excellent meal, definately coming back."}
{"text":"I took my parents here recently for their 30th anniversary dinner. I had called previously to get reservations and ensure that they would be able to accommodate for a vegetarian. That's always tricky with steakhouses. They did, which was great!

We had 2 of our guests who worked late that day and we had to shift the reservation time by an hour and the restaurant was extremely accommodating. Was worried about the last minute change, but when I called, they were superb about it. 

I LOVE the ambiance. The restaurant and its servers exude an old school, classical fine dining aura within the restaurant. It can't be compared to steakhouses with modern dining flair like Jacobs, but for a family dinner, I much preferred Peter's Fine Dining to Jacobs, where I had celebrated my brother's birthday a few months earlier. 

The prices were also very reasonable. For 6 of us, the bill came to under 500 including tax and tips. We didn't order very much alcohol, but I had noticed quite a few reasonable options on the wine list as well.

If you do visit, definitely order one of their liqueur coffees. They make it right in front of you, really quite the performance. :) The ladies were each given a long-stem rose at the end of the meal, which was a lovely gesture.

The only thing to note is that parking is limited. There are a few spots in the front and a few in the back and along one side of the building, which doesn't look very big."}
{"text":"U can't imagine interior gorgeous decoration from its appearance. And at last they gave a rose, for food we tried steak and lobster, it is good but definitely not the best"}
{"text":"In 2017, a restaurant policy that does not welcome children is simply shocking, in my humble opinion. 

When we tried to make a reservation with the Maitre D over the phone, we were initially refused the reservation because we had children. Shocked, I politely asked for the reason and was told that 'they had bad experiences with children before '. After some more discussion, the maitre D made an 'exception' and 'granted' us the reservation.

We later called the restaurant back to cancel our reservation due to its unaccommodating children policy (while I humbly believe we have well mannered children, we don't want our children to be potentially scrutinized from the moment they walk in the door.)

It is simply too bad..."}
{"text":"Service and quality is superb, peter cut prime rib is excellent, I have Gout and rolling the dice on my meal was worth it, my date had the lobster tail and she thought it was above average, she said she has had better elsewhere.

We did actually go in for the table side Cherries Jubilee for 2, it was delicious for my first try and my date put it up in her top 2 Jubilees'

I will have to try other cuts from the menu but they have earned my business."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and have always had a great time. I love the old school steak houses with the deep mohagany decor lol. Have been to many of these types of establishments (octagon, Duncan house, the school, hy's) and this is by far my favorite. The wait staff is just amazing..... Every waiter in the restaurant looks after you and makes sure everything is perfect. I used to love clubbing and getting  smashed downtown when I was younger but now I love coming to places like this and enjoying drinks with dinner with my friends. So every time we come we make a night of it. First off they bring you toasted garlic bread which is the best in the world no joke. Apps are amazing. Have had raw oyster they are really fresh and Come with the best horseradish, baked oysters are awesome, shrimp cocktail and scallops wrapped in bacon are my favorite.... The shrimps are massive they look like lobster tails and the scallops are so rich. Always get the ceaser salad (they prepare it in front of you and make the dressing from scratch) best I have had. Entrees are all huge portions.... Steak Neptune is my favorite..... The crab meat and hollandaise is too good for words.... Prime rib (peters cut) is massive be prepared for a triple bypass after that.... Rib steak is really good and the dover sole is delicious if you want something lighter. Desserts are also winners... My favorite is banana foster (again made in front of you). Cocktails are really good and I love having a couple cognac or grand marnier heated up after words. The price is just a step up from the keg but better than other places I mentioned above. It really is worth it when you see the size of the portions and the service. My favorite time coming here and will definitely be back many times."}
{"text":"We had the same problem that Barbara experienced. We would love to try this restaurant with our little one. However, once my husband mentioned about bringing a stroller with us, their tone of voice became not as friendly.

I am not sure why they said \"yes\" under \"good for kids\". I hope Yelp can remove it so customers with kids should not consider this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. A couple of months ago I called to place a reservation. I said it included a toddler and was promptly told they didn't have a table...even though I didn't get a chance to say how many spaces I needed.

Two days ago, I called to place a reservation...because I really want to try this place. I said I needed a corner table if possible to park a car seat/stroller. The moment I said that the tone of the conversation changed. I was asked, \"how old is the baby? because I don't want the baby disturbing other guests\". 

I was really baffled. I didn't see a sign that said \"no children under x age\". If I saw that, I definitely would not have tried to schedule a reservation. Although I realize your restaurant says \"fine dining\", I've taken my kids to several \"high class\" restaurants...and NEVER received the same reaction.

This is not a child friendly restaurant. No Thank you."}
{"text":"Peter's fine dining, what i can say is excellent. Their foods were excellent. Ordered the Diane Steak and Ribs steak, and they grilled to perfection, which is really medium rare and medium.... You have to try their salad...the dressing freshly made right beside your table. 
The service, this is what I called great restaurant service. Don't forget to make reservation before, since it is always full eventhough on wednesday night.
Great job Peter's...keep it up."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  

Must try the Peter's cut prime rib.  The best prime rib I have ever had.

All other dishes are above average.

Must try if you are in Markham."}
{"text":"Such a great place for my meat craving. The prime ribs and peppercorns steak are beautifully done. The caesar salad is super creamy. The service is excellent! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place.  Caesar salad was freshly made and best ever had.  The steaks were cooked to perfection.  The service was AAA."}
{"text":"The best place to go for steak and ceasar salad!

No contest: they freshly make the ceasar salad for you right at your table - authentic and old school, I always want more! Their prime rib and steak is perfectly cooked every time - thick and juicy. It's a lovely restauraurant, best enjoyed with a glass of wine and good company."}
{"text":"Strongly do not recommend this place. Located beside a Money Mart and across from a Dollar Store this place is NOT fine dining caliber. I'd recommend you drive a little to 'The School' at 14th and Birchmount area. That's where u will find fine dining and service is great. U can bring your family with kids and enjoy a great time.  Not like Peters Steak house where they discriminate against kids."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary... not planned just a new place to check out.   Food was excellent. ..Rockefeller oysters... cesar salad prepared by the table right in front of you- . 25 Oz.   Peter's cut and the Alaskian Crab legs. Ended the meal with crepes prepared again  by your tablesside.  Service was above excellent. .. very friendly, professional, seasoned mannerism. One of our unexpected hidden gem restaurants in Markham.  Two thumbs up.  Thanks especially to Tom,   John,  and Bill for making our  dinner a special one."}
{"text":"When I'm looking to go out for a special evening, Peter's is definitely my number one choice.  The service is excellent, and the owner, Tom is always there to greet you with a smile.  The food is always delicious - I've tried just about everything on the menu and it's all top notch!  The decor is old school, which I personally would like to see updated, but the atmosphere is intimate and makes for a great date night."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday celebration. The food and service were so amazing with timely manner and impressive gesture, we sure will visit again! Thanks for making this special evening even more unforgettable! :)"}
{"text":"I've driven by Peter's probably over a hundred times and never would I have thought that one of the best steakhouses that the city has to offer would be tucked in amongst a strip of mechanics and fast food joints.

I took my girlfriend here for a late Valentine's Day's dinner on Sunday night and from the moment we entered, the staff made sure our dining experience was memorable. The decor was warm and cozy and gave off an old school charm. 

We ordered the Chateaubriand for two and the portions were substantial. The beef was cooked to perfection and exquisite and the accompanying vegetables were well seasoned and flavorful. We didn't have room for dessert but ordered the New York Style Cheesecake anyway. Delicious!

The service is impeccable and the food was divine, it was a fantastic experience overall.  I plan on bringing my daughter here for her birthday in July."}
{"text":"The exterior may not look like much, but upon entering Peter's Fine Dining, you'll be convinced immediately that you will be dining finely. Valet parking is not available, and they seem to only have less than 15 parking spots in the back - I suggest parking at the plaza across. The interior decor is vintage and a bit grungy. The main entrance is small with a coat rack in the corner, the lighting is dark so be careful not to trip over the stairs. 

The Food:
Mermaid Platter $67 - 6oz. filet mignon was overly seared and more medium than medium rare (what I ordered). The scallops were large in size but not tender at all. The crab legs were deliciously meaty, but again a bit dry. The baked potato wasn't baked thoroughly, as in the potato skin wasn't separated from the actual potato and the potato itself wasn't flaky but instead hard to dig out with my fork. 

Baked Halibut - $34 Juicy and tender halibut with a small portion of veggies on the side.  

Peters Cut Prime Rib $41 - This is their signature item on the menu, and when it arrived at the table, I see why. This cut is ENORMOUS! I was actually in a bit of a shock when I saw it. I've never seen such a large piece of meat on a plate. I tried a piece, and it was a little tough and overly salted on the edges. The Regular cut is significantly smaller for $38. 

Banana Foster for Deux $20 - Exactly like a cherry jubilee, but with bananas! This is made beside your table, with a lovely fire show. 

Service: 
I have to stress the EXCELLENT service. Our water glasses are constantly filled, the waiters were not pretentious and were in fact very personable, making well-informed suggestions about what to order. They also know their wine list inside out. I also loved that they give roses to the ladies at the end of the night. 

One thing that was unnerving was when I was entering the tip amount into the credit card machine - it felt like the waiter was breathing down my neck trying to see how much percentage I would tip. I didn't give them 15% out of pressure, but just a note, it could annoy some people if they always do that."}
{"text":"I would never go back I was sat down and the waitress asked me if I wanted to drink which I said no just water and I never seen anybody after that. After 15 minutes of sitting I asked the manager hey can I get a waiter. I really was about to leave but I was starving The manager told the waiter come by and he acted like such a total jerk asked me what I wanted and it was it even the waitress had to bring my food but I have to admit the steak was good"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's day this year. While this restaurant may have received a lot of positive reviews, I was taken aback by their lack of service, or bias service. Maybe because both of us looked young (we're in our mid 20's) but we didn't hold back on splurging at the restaurant ordering appetizers, main courses, and alcoholic beverages. And we are definitely generous tippers.

I ordered Peter's famous prime rib - the juiciest piece of prime rib I've had. It was perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend ordered the peppercorn steak, which was cooked right in front of us - it was a bit too salty for his liking and the peppercorn overwhelmed the taste of the beef. We also ordered their bacon wrapped scallions, which were pretty delicious.

Overall, I like their food, but their service was, again, lacking. Maybe because we looked young, or that they were slammed on Valentine's day, however, from what I could see, other tables received better service than ours."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE this restaurant.

Yeah, it's old-school. The d√©cor is dated and Peter's is located on some road amidst apartment buildings and a gas station. But once inside, you are transported into a different era (okay a bit much, but I'm excited in writing this review!)

I decided to take my dad here for Father's Day, at his bequest. The place is tiny, but we were so lucky in getting a private-ish table on the \"second floor\" (which is only 4 steps up). I'm so glad we got this table because there was no one behind me and no one behind my dad. Love the older man with the crazy hair. It's like a Lion's mane - all thick, black, and flowing. 

Service was amazing and we started off with a bottle of Amarone della Valpolicella. We even got it in a fancy decanter which started the evening.

Highlights of the night were the table-made Ceasar Salad which is a show in itself. Both my dad and SO ordered the meat which comes in a very GENEROUS portion. I went for the Dover Sole (yumyum) and my mom decided to splurge with Alaskan King Crab. Seriously, the menu here has something for everyone and the prices reflect the generous (I can say that again) portion size.

I would highly recommend this place for parents and special occasion events, but hey, if you're in the area it could be a regular jaunt as well. Somehow, the old-ness of this place is what makes it so charming. And with waiters dressed in their penguin suits delivering A+ service, it just elevates Peter's that much more.

5 stars in my books!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant - everything from the waiters who are such gentlemen to the decor to the food. Firstly, restaurant and the surrounding parking space looks tiny, but is very spacious on the inside.  The decor is a dark, classic timeless look which suits so well with the waiters and food.  

Their ceasar salad is a must try - the waiter wheels a little cart close to your table and makes it right in front of you, egg and sauce and all.  Absolutely the best salad I've tasted and well worth the price.  

I've had both steak and prime rib here and both are great.  Portions are huge though the plate will look a bit empty as they bring the side (baked potato or others) on a different plate.  Both times i was unable to finish my plate of food so I have not had a chance to try their dessert menu.  

On top of all this, their staff is a very friendly group of people and would love to chat with you.  Both times I was surprised as the waiter drops off a single stem rose for me at our table.  Such a small gesture that makes the whole experience that much better."}
{"text":"This is a relic - everything is old, decor, waiters, menus, the waiters hair - silver and all male over 50. The only good thing here is the prime rib Peter's style, reminds me of Old Ed's which after Mirvish's son took over closed down. What a shame. I would say if Ed's was still around this would be its best competition for prime rib but for $40 bucks its steep."}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse in Markham hands down! Been here many times and it never disappoints. My favorite is the tomahawk - we usually share this between 2-3 people. Steak is always consistent - tender and flavourful. I also love their classic Caesar salad! They make it from scratch infront of you. Soo delicious. Their desserts and coffee are also a must if you still got room haha. Banana foster is my favorite - they cook it infront of you as well. It's hard to find places like this nowadays!

Price is steep here but worthwhile especially for special occasions. Customer service is amazing, staff are always happy and you can tell they enjoy what they do."}
{"text":"This small popular restaurant is one of my favorites but very pricey.  I like their Steak Diane $57 prepared at your table.  Lowest price appetizer is escargot $14 with others much more.  Caesar Salad $28 for two.  NY Steaks and Filet in the $63 range for 16 oz.  Back Ribs at $35 are good.  2 lobster tails for $82 is a bit rich.  Reserve ahead.  Parking is terrible but free."}
{"text":"Don't really understand the hype. The food quality is decent, but service is just okay considering the $$ you will be paying. The overall experience is more upscale compare to other steakhouses like KEG, but the price also goes up accordingly. All in all, a decent place with great drink options, but the service really needs some work."}
{"text":"Been here over and over again for the last few years. Their Prime Ribs are the best and always cooked to perfection. A MUST TRY! I can never eat a prime rib anywhere else. And the Caesar Salad is amazing! They make make it right in front of you!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I drove by this restaurant for 6 years and didn't expect much given the unspectacular \"curb appeal\". This will teach me from judging a book by its cover. Let's get started - here's the long list of good:

- Top notch service, best I ever experienced in any restaurant. This is old school service, they do everything for you. 

- Caesar salad is made fresh for you. They start by grinding the garlic cloves, and then the anchovies. Next is the egg and oils followed by bacon bits and croutons. Best salad ever!

- They bring all the women in the restaurant fresh roses

- The steak - spectacular. The Peter's cut prime rib is a few inches thick and cooked perfectly to your taste. WARNING - this is a massive slab of meat!

- Steaks cooked perfectly

- Peppercorn steak is amazing. They even finish cooking it at your table in a wine / peppercorn sauce over an open flame. 

- They ask to make sure you have everything you need

- Bread at the table is also fantastic

- Brazilian Coffee to die for. Takes about 5-10 minutes and made at the table as well. For a brief period of time, I thought the table could catch fire given the open flame.

- Most deserts also finished at the table. These waiters earn every penny. Open flame alert here as well

- Decent wine list

- Nice old school feel in the restaurant. 

And the not so good - just one item:

- As a beer lover, I was a little disappointed that they only had one beer on tap - Morreti, an Italian beer but it was ok. This place is all about the beef.    

What a great experience. I highly recommend this steak house. It's definitely pricier than the keg (by about 30% - 40%) but worth every penny. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We went to Peter's fine dining for my birthday, it was great, the food was delicous with generous amounts. My daughter and wife got a meal for two, they generousally splitted the meal onto two plates for them, adding extra vegetables and side. At the end, they brought me a slice of cake with a candle, it was great! The service was AMAZING! The interior design is beautfiull with a sense that you are sitting by a fire. The food was delicious and all in all we had an amazing night! I definitely recommmend Peter's fine dining!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside, but this is a great old school steak house/restaurant.

I can't think of a better place to get steak in Markham. This is certainly a big step above the Keg and other chains; although, I wouldn't quite put in the same league as the higher-end Toronto steak houses. The portions are very large here, and the peppercorn steak in particular is great.

The service is excellent, and the decor is pretty old school without seeming cheesy.

I get the impression that this restaurant has very loyal clientele and does a lot of repeat business, which is always a good sign."}
{"text":"I am not a steak person, but I love the steak here!! My boyfriend ordered prime rib and I order the steak and scallop. The medium rare are cook just right and its soo juicy; the scallop are seriously fresh that you can taste the sea in your mouth! We will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This place is like a blast from the past or an homage to old school steak houses. Don't expect like fancy, and by fancy I mean innovative takes on steaks and seafood. The place is a smaller more intimate restaurant with divided and elevated sections with booths to increase the intimacy of a meal. The restaurant is also more dimly lit. 

They do something a little different than your standard bread basket, they provide you with garlic toast, warm out of the oven, but don't fill up on these because the steaks and entrees are massive unless you're ordering from the light fare menu. They also provide olives and briny-er pickles. 

The escargots come soaked in garlic and butter and/or olive oil, either way delicious. They also coming bubbling so please mind you tongues lest you want to burn them on delicious snail morsels. 

The French onion soup has a great depth of flavour but became salty on the palates as described by my partners mother. It had a good amount of melted cheese, which in my mind was the best part of the soup, but again maybe not our smartest decision before getting large steaks because we struggled with this meal. 

The seafood platter my partners mother got was accompanied by a cute little set up of drawn butter. The plate itself also has a good variety of seafood (2 lobster tails, snow crab legs/claws, scallops, etc) but be warned this plate is priced at market price (we paid $90 for the seafood platter that night). 

My partners father got the prime rib and he usually opts for larger portions be even he recognized that 16oz was probably the way to go vs the 24oz bone in Peter's cut. My partner who can eat, but boy 16oz of steak... she did her best but only managed to complete 2/3 of he steak. The steaks came out perfectly medium rare in the middle and were tender and almost melt in your mouth good. The au jus or whatever the sauce on the bottom added a level of salt that increased as you ate. The saving grace she said was the horse radish that accompanied to help cut the level of salt and compliment the steak. I also recommended cutting up a pickles to eat in between a few bites. 

I have the aged New York strip. Again this is not blow your mind steak place but the steaks are all very well cooked and very well seasoned. The striploin has no accompanying sauces but tasted really good tender in the middle but more chewing than the prime rib (which is to be expected). The steak flavour really comes through, likely from the aging process and the accompanying vegetable were crisp and a pleasant break from all the steakiness. 

The waiters and one waitress are all dressed up in their suit jackets and our server George was this older I believe Italian man who was really cute. The host does sport a very Gene Simmons-esque hair style which did not match the other server and the interior of the restaurant. 

The service was expected of a restaurant of this set-up. The sections are smaller and it appeared as if one server as assigned a section each so they tend to hover at the foot of the elevated section. Some of the server are also sporting a more European accent including the host who when we called my partner had difficulty with understanding him. But they do ask if there are children and if you're celebrating anything. They priced a cake with a written message based on you answer. So my partners father got a very nice chocolate cake. Again not anything fancy but very well done. 

Btw the rumors are true. Every lady get a rose from the host at the end of the meal so if you're on a date with someone and you didn't get flowers know this beforehand in case you feel like it's gonna look bad that the host gave you date a flower and you didn't. Just a tip for those splurging on a date night. 

In all honestly this should be a 5 star restaurant if this was 20-30 years ago but with the changing landscape of food it a little dated but also an experience that some people might miss. Take your parents of grandparent out to this restaurant and share a plate because like I said the steaks are huge and an homage to an more classic way of fine dining."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite steakhouse of all time! I'm a frequent customer here because all of my family members love to dine here on their birthdays/anniversaries. This is a classic fine dining restaurant located on the east side of Markham. 

FOOD: They have a wide selection of steaks available, they've got the typical roasted prime ribs and peppercorn steaks cooked right at your table. Regardless of which kind of steak, it is almost guaranteed that the meat is tender (almost melts in your mouth) and of great quality. I've never had a failed steak at Peter's. And their freshly baked garlic bread is to die for! Word of advice, don't stuff yourself with too much of them (even though they are unlimited), save room for their delicious steaks. Because you'll get hooked for sure! Not a huge selection for dessert but you definitely get your money worth when you go to Peter's on any occasion.

ENVIRONMENT: How a fine dining restaurant should be, formal table setting with nice china. The restaurant is very dim so taking pictures with your food is a challenge (#foodieproblems) but it serves a perfect ambiance for a fancy dinner. 

SERVICE: Service is top notch like what you'd expect from a fine dining restaurant. Their staff / owner is always friendly and will greet you at the door, and help you with your coats. They also give each lady customer a rose at the end of the meal. I thought that's a very heart warming touch."}
{"text":"This is really a nice place to go for a special occasion. It's very charming where most of the servers are older gentleman. This place serves steak so I would avoid if vegetarian.

I ordered the table side Caesar salad which was delicious. Our server Frank made the salad and also  the steak Diane for one of my friends. I was really impressed with his professionalism and his culinary skills. I ordered the 16 oz regular cut prime rib. It was very tender and flavourful. It also comes with a side. I can't believe this is regular size because it was enormous. I purposely came really hungry and still could only finish half. 

The food and service are on point here. They also give all the ladies here a rose on your way out which is a nice touch. Thus place is expensive but you get what you pay for. Definitely a great place to go to celebrate something special!"}
{"text":"Fine dining Gem in Unionville! Good steak and seafood restaurant. They offer unlimited garlic bread which is super yum! Had the prime rib which was good, but most prime ribs I find are quite similar. Sides are the usual. 

The best part of this restaurant is the dessert and service! The waiters are all dressed up and very classic and provided great service. The place is very old school looking and even looked a bit dingy from the outside, here's where they lost points. However, the food is good, old fashion and wholesome. For desserts we ordered the the banana foster pour deux and the crepe suzette pour deux, it might seem kinna pricey at $22 but I think it's worth it. They bring out this cart with different flavouring and liqueurs and they cook it in front of you. Cooking the differnt ingredients and lighting the liqueur on fire and putting on a show for you. Which was quite entertaining and is good for special occasions. The Banada foster tasted quite good and it's reallly different from anything else i've had before. The sauteed bananas with cinnamon and brown sugar as well as rum was divine. Cooked fresh and placed over vanilla ice-cream is exactly what you are paying for with the 22 bux! Of course you get two portions as it is for two people. I must say that I thought the crepe suzette was not as good. The crepe was not as professionally made, although fresh. They need to optimize their batter a little bit to make it more smooth. Also it may be because I just don't like the orange flavour as much and it is lacking a fruit component. 

Overall very happy with the quality and portions of the food and the quality of the service. There is ample parking in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Ate here while on a business trip. The atmosphere is spectacular, and the wait staff is friendly and attentive. I had the 8oz strip steak with scallops and everything was excellent. The warm bread, pickles, and olives are a nice warm-up before dinner, and the espresso afterward was good as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Peter's is one of the better steakhouses in Markham but it still does not match up to Jacobs & Co in downtown Toronto. The experience is more upscale than the Keg. Some dishes at Peter's stood out, but when it comes down to the steak itself, it was not exceptionally better than the Keg (which is surprising, considering the price difference).


 I ordered the:

Caesar Salad Made Tableside ($27 for a serving for 2 people) - DELICIOUS. The dressing packs in a lot of sharp flavours so it isn't ideal for those who like mild foods. They load up on the garlic, anchovies, worcestershire and tobasco sauce - the dressing has a bite to it. 

French Onion Soup ($11) - One of the better french onion soups I have had, but not the best. The broth is rich, dark and beefy. There is a generous amount of stretchy, cheese on top but it was mild tasting (I prefer when  sharper, bitter cheese is used). 

24 oz. Bone In Rib Steak ($59) - This was shared between 2 people and came with a side of mashed potatoes. Considering I ate bread, olives, caesar salad and soup before this arrived, there were leftovers. The steak was very thick and correctly cooked as requested (medium rare). Some portions were really tender but other bites were chewy and hard to work through. Compared to other steakhouses, the seasoning was very light and bland, so the salt shaker came out a few times. 

Mashed Potatoes - Average, a little gritty and not creamy. The keg has better mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here last night for a birthday party.the environment was excellent. The host and servers are always frendly. I didnt have to ask for water as the friendly waiter always top my glass of water.

Very good i believe it is a nice place to bring a date to. We were a big group of people. All the orders came in at same time was excellent. 

Complimentary garlic toast as well as all those in pickled cucumber. 

For an appetizer we ordered green salad with creamy garlic. Although u dont get a big portion of saladbut it was nice and creamy. The soup of the day was creamy broccoli, not too salty was perfect another soup that we had was French onion soup, that one was a little bit more salty love the cheese on the top of the soup.

For the main course we ordered the rib eye bone in steak medium rare. when they brought it out it was perfect crispy on the outside and very rare on the inside I loved it. The flavors were excellent well balanced salt very tender for 55$ 24oz i believe.

Another dish that we had was a single lobster tail with mashed potato on the side. The lobster flavor was nice but a little bit more dry.

I will come back it was very nice because at the end any ladies were given the flower to all the ladies in the table. That was perfect. Its a very nice place to go for some very well cook meat. All host and servers are very nice. When the bill came, we ask if all the bills can be split and they happy to accommodate our request. I been here 2 times now bith experience were very good.
Im writting this at 5am almost, sorry if i miss anything or my grammar is not top."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and experience for my grandfather's 85th birthday! We enjoyed the food (especially the Caesar salad) and that we were not rushed through our dinner. Everyone was kind and attentive."}
{"text":"If I could add a meme to a Yelp review, I would insert the \"So close\" Freddy Mercury meme to this restaurant since it hit 5 stars in so many ways, but missed the mark in one area which I will describe later.

The outside of Peter's is fairly humble. It has a bit of charm that way, but on the other hand, if they are fine dinning (which they are), they should spruce the place up a little. Not really a critical issue however. The inside is well-kept, but a little dated too. Again, it does add to the charm of it a bit.

From the time my wife and I were greeted, right until we left about 2+ hours later, we experienced some of the best service we've ever had. Very friendly, extremely attentive, and you're treated like royalty. At one point, we both went to the washroom and returned to find our side plates replaced with new ones and given newly folded napkins. Towards the end of the night, they even offered to move us to a more elevated table as it became available, though we had never indicated concerns beforehand.

We had to try the made-from-scratch caesar salad. It isn't a mere novelty, as a dressing is made from egg, vinegars, anchovies, garlic and a couple other ingredients done right in front of you. It's actually fairly good value since it was 10-15 minutes of labour and was a large portion for 2. If you like your caesar dressing strong (i.e. garlic), you've reached caesar salad heaven.

My wife wanted the ribs appetizer, and though I wasn't too excited about the thought initially, I was very surprised at how good they were. Absolutely perfect in the texture, cooking time and taste.

My wife went for the steak and lobster. They knocked it out of the park with both, with the lobster standing out particularly. It had to be the meatiest lobster tail I'd ever seen.

I went with their prime rib, which I had heard they were famous for. The piece they gave me was massive, and certainly far bigger than the advertised weight. I'd have to say however that as I was eating it, I did have a mild sense of disappointment as it wasn't as flavourful as I would've hoped. It was perfectly enjoyable, but the fact that I had a little bit of buyer's remorse and wished I had ordered a steak did bring the experience (and this rating) down a little bit.

We were given a free piece cake, as they knew we were celebrating a birthday since they asked when I made reservations. They also gave my wife (and other female patrons) a free rose too.

I'm still dying to come back and would recommend the place wholeheartedly. Normally I can round up if just one thing is slightly off, but when it's a steakhouse, the review has to be centred around the steak."}
{"text":"Peter's is a nice and great place to have a great prime rib!! For the price you pay its totally worth it!! Our whole table of 8 got the regular cut prime rib with a baked potato! It was cooked to perfection! 

Once you walked through the doors you were greeted. The main person was very friendly and gave out roses to the ladies at the table at the end of the meal. 

The only thing that this place needs to improve on are the waiters who reach infront of customers at the table to pour water, serve food and remove dishes. A simple \"pardon my reach\" or even an \"excuse me\" so we can acknowledge that you're about to reach infront of our faces instead of being surprised with your arm inches away from our face. 

I would definitely come back again and recommend this place to others"}
{"text":"After 10+ years of driving by here with my parents regularly, I finally decided to take them here in celebration of my dad's birthday. I couldn't be happier with this decision. The food, service, and atmosphere were impeccable. 

We ordered 2 appetizers to share between 4 people: the petite coquille, and the smoked salmon. Both were amazing, but the petite coquille was the star of the night. 

The red spring filet of salmon, steak Dianne, peppercorn steak, and ribeye were ordered for our main courses. All the steaks were cooked to our preference, medium rare. 

Everyone left with a huge smile and a happy stomach. The roses they gave us at the end of dinner were a nice touch. I will definitely take my family here again for future nights out. This restaurant is a gem in this city. Classic food done right with great service and a warm ambience."}
{"text":"Being raised in Markham you could imagine my surprise to see a fining dining option right down the street. Once you step inside, you enter a world of another tier.  As you take your seats the waiters will offer up their hearts. Throughout the night, a waiter will engage your group in a polite conversation. This is truly a lovely treat.

Leaning on previous reviews, we decided to go for the caesar salad and fillet mignon. Both were magnificent! Now, you've probably had 'cesar salad' plenty of times before, in your head you could probably picture it. Yet nothing could have prepared us for this... 

i'll stop on this note as my words only diminish the experience. Words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they're brought out. Now go. Go and experience it with your loved ones."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic from start to finish, from the gentle smile of the server leading us to our table to the interactive fiery tableside dining experience. The ambiance had a very distinct European flair and it felt like I was in Italy. The food was excellent - we got the Stuffed Filet of Sole and the Steak Diane which was cooked tableside. The appetizer were very delicate escargots, which were tender and full of flavor. The complimentary garlic bread was a big step above bread you would get from other restaurants, and you could tell it was baked fresh (no butter needed!). Finally, for desserts, I got the creme brulee while my date tried his hands at the Nutcracker Coffee (once again, prepared tableside). What really sold us on this restaurant was how friendly everyone was, and we interacted with several servers during the course of our meal. One of them even gave me a pink rose. I would definitely recommend this place and come back again."}
{"text":"Consistently ranked as the top restaurant in Markham by Yelp, Tripadvisor, Urbanspoon AND Google? It couldn't just be a coincidence. So the family and I decided to come on my birthday to see for ourselves. On the exterior, it looks like a long, residential house with a big, yellow sign out front. When you step foot inside, you're surrounded by old school elegance and treated like a FINE sir/lady. Some other reviewer commented that you feel like THE BOSS from the moment you walk in. YOU CERTAINLY DO. The first thing that hits your senses is that beautiful, beef aroma as you are being led to your table. We made our reservation for 7:30 on a weekday (which is a perfect time imo as the restaurant had a decent number of ppl but wasn't packed).

First thing I noticed, all the servers were welcoming, friendly and charming. Always smiling and patient with questions. This is where I give a shout out to our server, Frank, who took care of us for the evening from start to finish and did a superb job. My water glass was never empty. Frank was superman. I asked him at the end of the meal, how long he had been working at Peter's. He told me 30 years. Wowsers. The customer care really shined. 5 star service my friend. A+, indeed. 

Now on to the food.

Within 5-10 min of casual conversation, you are given complimentary starters at your table. A big basket of soft, toasty garlic bread as well as a plate of pickles and red olives. My oh my, that homemade garlic bread was divine. It was placed in front of my mom for the entire meal and she was tempted to fill up on it before the appetizers arrived.

For appetizers we got:

1) Escargots Bourguignon ($14)
Snails served in garlic butter and topped with spinach. Dish was pretty good. Wouldn't order it again though.

2) Oysters Rockefeller ($23)
Baked oysters on a bed of spinach and topped with hollandaise sauce. This was a really, pretty dish. Great for instagram lol. It tasted just as good as it looked. They were briny, very fresh and my dad's fave appetizer.

3) Lobster Bisque with Cognac ($15)
Creamed lobster stock with cognac reduction. My bro and I pegged this as our 2nd fave app of the night. Extremely rich, intense umami flavor and big chunks of lobster running through it. The cognac depth of flavor was quite strong and bold. Could definitely taste it. My dad thought it was too salty but I completely disagreed haha.

4) Scallops Wrapped in Bacon ($18)
BEST APP OF THE NIGHT according to my brother, mom and myself. Fantastic dish. Generous portion size. Scallops cooked to perfection. Bacon was crispy but moist still. Perfect sauce. Perfect seasoning. This appetizer is a **MUST GET**.

I had a tough time deciding between steak or prime rib. Unfortunately, Frank told us the prime rib sold out before we even arrived at the restaurant. Damn, I forgot some ppl eat super early. I told myself this was not a bad thing. All it meant was, IM GETTING PRIME RIB WHEN I GO BACK NEXT TIME AND YES THERE WILL ABSOLUTELY BE MANY MORE TIMES.

Anyways, for mains:

My mom had an 8 oz filet mignon ($50). It was wrapped in bacon and had a great texture. My brother and I each got a 24 oz porterhouse ($62) for ourselves. I got mine medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. SO JUICY AND TENDER. MMMMM. Great seasoning and cut \"like butter\" as chefs like to say. My dad ordered a 16 oz ribeye steak ($54) for himself and funny enough, wasn't able to finish so my bro and I happily gobbled up the remains.

My brother and dad got veggies to accompany their steak while my mom and I got baked potatoes. Frank came around with butter, sour cream and pepper to go with the potato.

Once all the dishes were cleared, Frank presented me with a slice of chocolate truffle cake on the house because it was my birthday. At this point, the whole family was really stuffed and satisfied but my bro and I had read way too many positive comments about the bananas foster so we decided to try it. 

Dessert:

Bananas Foster ($26)
This was served tableside. Frank saut√©ed the bananas in butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and banana liquer. Then he flamb√©ed with spiced rum and served it with vanilla ice cream. Strong rum flavor balanced by the caramel sauce and ice cream. Anything you order tableside is made without fail and expertly done. I would say this dessert is an \"experience\" and a **MUST GET** at least once.

My mom was given a rose at the end of dinner which was a pleasant surprise. We all agreed that the portion sizes were fair and generous. That was key for me. A lot of fine dining restaurants give you these insanely tiny portion sizes while charging exorbitant prices. But Peter's firmly matches stable price with quality AND quantity.

Obviously the bill was steep but for a special occasion, worth it. I would recommend/suggest this place in a heartbeat to friends and family for such occasions in the future. 

P.S. Mark my words. I'm coming back to try that prime rib. You can bank on it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Service and ambiance. 
Steaks are amazing. Love the garlic bread, pickle and olives at the start.  I ate too much."}
{"text":"The ambiance and service was top notch (A++). Defiantly a place to impress your date. It better be when it's easily a $300 meal for two!

The food was also fancy and often prepared table side for theatrics. You'll leave feeling full; not small portions. However, my taste buds weren't overly impressed by the traditional fine dining affairs."}
{"text":"Service was excellent!! I preferred this restaurant over Harbour Sixty to be honest. It reminds me of Barbarians (which I also love). 
Traditional decor, which we loved. Excellent service. Smaller restaurant that makes for a more intimate dinning experience. Food was excellent. We ordered the oysters Rockefeller. We had the chateaubriand for 2 as our main. I was disappointed we didn't get the Caesar salad, but we were glad we didn't because our main was huge! We both didn't finish. I think the dishes for two are a great option. 
Best service I've ever had. We will be returning. We had a wonderful time. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"You've done it again Yelp. You've guided me to a restaurant in my very own backyard and blew my mind. I must've passed Peter's hundreds of times and never gave it a second look. Though modest from the front, it is truly a unique experience inside. The first thing you smell when you step into this fine establishment is, surprisingly, pina colada. It's a bit of a disconnect from the traditional wood decor and old-fashioned loveliness a couple more steps inwards. As you check in your coat (which I've never had in a restaurant before), you begin to smell that distinct sizzling aroma of a juicy steak. 

The wait staff are friendly, professional and absolutely deserving of full points. As young adults with a face that could still be in school, I was worried we might be judged at a place where the median age is around my parents' age. It was so nice to be proven wrong. Our servers were courteous and hospitable, with great recommendations on the wine. We didn't have to wait long for food, our waters were always filled, and we felt taken care of all night. If you order any of the table-side dishes, they are all expertly prepared and the training that these servers went through clearly show. 

It also doesn't hurt that our food was amazing from start to finish: 

1) Warm garlic bread, pickles, and olives start the meal. I had to be very careful not to fill up on the bread, but it was very tempting. 

2) My boyfriend and I ordered the Oysters Rockefeller. The oysters were very fresh with a generous helping of savoury spinach and Hollandaise. ($21)

3) The steaks....I am so glad I don't have to travel downtown to get great steak! I ordered the 16oz. regular cut prime rib ($39) and I finished everything. I have a hard time finishing a regular 8oz. steak sometimes so you have to understand this really meant something. It was a perfect medium rare that cut like butter. My boyfriend got the 24oz. Porterhouse ($55). He wanted to take the bone in his hands and gnaw at it, but we had to keep up our appearances :) 

4) The table-side bananas foster ($24) was fantastic. Our server was very friendly and informative, bringing our attention to all the delicious scents. The end result was caramelized, boozy bananas over vanilla ice cream. Perfect. 

At the end of the dinner, they give all the ladies a rose, which was a first for me and definitely a memorable end to a memorable dinner. I think I've found my new special occasions go-to! Peter's is truly one-of-a-kind in Markham and a whole other level above any regular steak franchise. Among a multitude of accolades from Tripadvisor, Urbanspoon, and city organizations, was a small red sticker that read: \"People love us on Yelp!\". We sure do, Peter's Fine Dining. We sure do.

(25/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Flamb√© steak, flamb√© dessert and even flamb√© coffee; maybe it's the pyromaniac in me, but I was drawn to Peter's Fine Dining. Hubby and I came on a Tuesday for lunch, without reservations. The friendly host, who happens to be one of the co-owners, checked in my hubby's coat and led the two of us to a cozy booth for four. 

The dining area was softly lit, decorated in warm wood tones with linen tablecloths, and piano music quietly playing in the background. Noticed all the diners were well dressed and even the waiters were wearing suits and bow ties.

It was the host who introduced us to our waiter by name. Our waiter lit the candle at our table and served us water and complimentary garlic bread with olives and pickles to start off with.

WE ORDERED
- USDA Prime Junior Peppercorn Steak flamb√©ed tableside. Subbed side with a salad. The steak was juicy and flavorful.
- Atlantic salmon with baked potato - Salmon was cooked perfectly but needed more seasoning.
- Chocolate Truffle Cake with Belgian chocolate truffle with chocolate glaze. The base is a moist cake layer, OH SO DELISH! What made me happier was that it was complimentary; happy birthday to me!

Service was impeccable: well mannered, polite, attentive but not intrusive. 

One the way out I happened to inquire about the picture of the rock group Kiss that I saw by the washroom. The co-owner said that he was a friend of theirs and they come by the restaurant once in a while, VERY COOL! Before we left he handed me a beautiful bi-colored rose SWEET! 

Do yourself a favor, leave the kids at home, get all dolled up and take your spouse out for a well deserved romantic date."}
{"text":"Favourite place for steak in Markham. Spectacular service with delicious food to go with it. Will return here for any special events because we're never disappointed."}
{"text":"Booked a surprise birthday for my fianc√© and it was amazing! The service and food was exceptional. We booked the party room -spacious and great atmosphere. There was a bar on the corner as well which you could order drinks as well. The owners were super helpful in the whole process which made my planning super easy. I tried the Neptune filet mignon which had hollandaise sauce and crab meat, came with asparagus on the side and mash. It was delicious-cooked to perfection. Even the mash. We had under 20 people and they managed to get everyone's steaks done right! I would definitely be back here again. Close by,great steak and great service!"}
{"text":"This steakhouse was recommended to us because our friends (that don't have kids) told us it was a must try! Upon arrival, it felt like we weren't welcomed because we had a 2 year old in our arms. The host (one with long black hair and creepy face) seated us in the corner. While the server was nice and respectful, the host kept hovering over us. And my son was playing on the iPad with no sound. He didn't even make ANY sound until a small giggle and the host came right over and said \"we can't be having this kind of noise in the restaurant. You have to leave\" 
So they packed our unfinished meals and shoved us the bill and then said \" look at the sign, it doesn't say family restaurant\" 

Looking back, we shouldn't have paid the bill. So completely utterly disgusted."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary and this place definitely did not disappoint - everything was so delicious and the service was just outstanding!

For starters we had oysters rockefeller and ceasar salad. The ceasar salad was made the traditional way, which is made tableside by the waiters, and the oysters were deliciously creamy with a baked cheese crust.

For our main dish I had a regular sized slice of roast beef, while my husband tried one of their steaks. Luckily I did not order the Peter's cut for the roast beef, as I could hardly finish their regular cut. 

For our desserts we tried their banana foster which was flamb√©ed tableside as well, and served over vanilla ice cream, simply delicious!

As a surprise to our anniversary they gave me a rose, and a slice of chocolate truffle cake greeting us on our anniversary, such a beautiful finishing touch to a wonderful evening at this restaurant. 

Peter's Fine dining is such a wonderful place to come, it has the perfect mix of relaxed atmosphere and old world nostalgic charm. We will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"We went here for a work event and it was a fabulous experience.  It definitely is fine dinning and the service was excellent.  

We enjoyed the freshly made Caesar salad made from scratch and made to order.  The quickly whipped it up and it was absolutely divine.  Very flavourful and seasoned perfectly.

I ordered the steak as my entree and it was cooked to perfection.  I enjoyed each succulent bite and finished my steak in no time flat.  Along with the steak were some carrots and broccoli, and a baked potato.  They even serve up the toppings for the baked potato which included butter and sour cream.  I also enjoyed the pickles and olives that they put out for everyone to enjoy.

The last course was dessert which was a choice of pecan pie, truffle or cheesecake.  By the time I got to the dessert I was pretty much stuffed and I got the chocolate pecan pie.  I found the pie to be a little bit disappointing in that it was a bit bland and didn't taste at all like I thought it would.  Moreover, didn't like the raspberry sauce they served with it as the flavours seemed to clash.

Overall, it was a great experience and the food was great!  Definitely worth going to when you want a nice steak or prime rib."}
{"text":"Came here for an early vday dinner. The hosts and waiters were very friendly, service was 5/5. We really enjoyed the petite coquille for the appetizer (generous mix of seafood with cheese on top). We got the steak with scallops and stuffed sole. The food here is simply presented but very delicious and perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"About the best restaurant I have ever been to. Service is amazing and boy do they feed you!! Hidden gem in Markham!"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Markham. Always love visiting this place. They always make you feel special. I love the way they make the caesar salad in front of you and the end result would be an absolute heavenly salad. Their steak is top notch, never disappoints. Wine selection is incredible. Even their house wine is divine (I always order their house Cabernet Sauvignon).  It's a lovely cozy place for a date or any special occasions. Guests who come to this place are always nice and appreciative. It's an old establishment but I totally heart this place."}
{"text":"Very classy restaurant great for a date night. Looks a lot more spacious from the inside. Who knew there was such a lovely place in uptown! There was coat check, and a friendly reception. Our waiter was charismatic, charming and was very engaging during my experience. 

Strawberry Daiquiri - Very red a drink, love the pulp. It's very sweet so it tasted like dessert!

Fresh Oysters On the Half Shell (MP) - Served with horseradish (the real deal; the good ol spicy stuff that's rare now), lemon, cocktail sauce, a tiny fork and spoon which helps with eating. They were either shucked poorly or were taken from the freezer? Although the oyster was definitely connected to the shell, they were all macerated and fragmented. The taste was good though. However I think I'll pass on this if I come back. 1/5

Steak Neptune (~$54) - filet mignon, topped with crab meat, asparagus hollandaise
One of the best medium-rare steaks I've had. The sauce is nice and creamy. Love that it's fresh and real crab-leg meat. This is the most tender asparagus I've had too. It comes with a  side. I chose the mashed potatoes and wasn't disappointed 5/5

Steak and Lobster (~$79) - 8 oz USDA Prime New York Steak and 11 oz. Lobster Tail
Served with THE BEST butter garlic ever. The butter is super fresh. It's kept melted over a candle so it's a nice touch. The lobster especially is extremely extremely tender, it's unbelievable 5/5

The host/owner remembered my name upon exiting simply based on my telling them when making the reservation. I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"After a terrible experience at the Octagon a few weeks ago, I was aching for a visit to Peter's (which, if you did not read my previous review of the Octagon, both restaurants have the same format and similar offerings).  We went last night for my mom's birthday.  

First - the room is old school, with gold/brass and intricate woodworking.  We were seated next to the fireplace (first time to get this table and it is indeed, the best table in the house).  The complimentary relish tray is fantastic - the garlic bread is the best I've had and their pickles are legit.  

Between the five of us - there was caesar salad (table side, natch), scallops, crab cakes, steaks, ribs, onion rings, breaded shrimp and all of the accompaniments (fries, mash, veg).  One thing that's changed somewhat recently is that they no longer offer two sides with the mains.  I had to order a side of vegetables.  It's a small thing, but it's a bit annoying.  

The restaurant offered my mom a complimentary dessert, which was a nice touch.  I have literally never had a dessert at Peter's b/c I'm always more interested in savoury items.  

The night always ends with the host bringing roses to the females at the table.  Like I said - old school, but I love it.  

My parents haven't eaten here as much as I have.  My mom was truly impressed by the steak.  Aged beef and melts in your mouth.  The service is lovely.  A bunch of older, greek dudes who know how to make you feel welcome.   

OH, and b/c I always look for this in yelp reviews -- I brought my 5 year old.  There weren't any special offerings for children (that I know of, admittedly I didn't ask, we just ordered from the regular menu for him).  It is welcoming to children, though I wouldn't bring a child who has a risk of acting up.  Mine is at an age now where he is well behaved - he loves to dress up and eat good food in a grown-up atmosphere.  There was one other child in the restaurant, probably around 7 or 8 and he was watching videos on his parents' phone, which I thought was a shame.  I would have been really annoyed to be seated at a nearby table.  If your kid needs an iPad to keep them entertained, please do not bring them here.

It is pricey.  But, in my opinion, it's worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Often a meal is just a meal....a steak is just a steak...but.....occasionally it is much more than that.

We went to Peter's for our wedding anniversary last night. Upon entering Peter's you notice that the decor is sedate and old school, but in fantastic conditions. The place is spotless and the staff is very welcoming. Tom, the owner is on hand to greet diners and steer you to your table.

The waiters are a rare breed....professional waiters that have been doing this for years, while being friendly and smiling but not snooty. This elevates the dining experience several notches.

We were served, before our meal, delicious style of garlic toast, kalamata olives and pickles.

I began my meal with a French Onion Soup, which to my surprise arrived rather quickly......but it was perfect....The broth was rich, the onions tender and the topping extremely tasty. I would have added a bit more Gruyere, but that is just a matter of personal taste.

We then shared a Caesar Salad which was prepared at table-side. This was very common in the 1970's but is not done much anymore. All the ingredients were displayed on the prep cart and chatted with the waiter while the 'show' went on. We requested a teenie bit more garlic and anchovies, and I was really really really please to see that a raw egg yold was being used in the dressing. Finally a real Caesar Salad! We were then served the Caesar Salad which met all our expectations and was truly one of the best I ever had.

We then were presented with our main course. Judy had her Sirloin Steak brought on the table side cart for finishing. She had ordered the Peppercorn Steak and it is 'sauced' and flambee'd at table side. I had ordered a bone-in Rib steak Pittsburgh style. Both steaks were presented with a beautiful baked potato and assorted vegetables.

The Rib Steak was BY FAR the best I ever had. It was better than Ruth Cris' and better than  Moshe's in Montreal which was my standard so far. It was far better then several name American Steak Houses in various cities. This is the steak I would order if I was forced to choose a last meal....it was that good.

The Peppercorn Steak was also delicious when I tasted it and when I finished the last quarter, although Judy did yeoman's duty in eating most of it.

This was accompanied by a nice bottle of Merlot, a gift from family members. The meal was capped by the presentation of beautiful piece or chocolate cake with a decorated plate wishing us Happy Anniversary.I have informed them of that fact when making a reservation. Judy was also presented with a long stem rose and as we sipped Greek Coffees.

It was a wonderful meal......you have to try go!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and I couldn't help to compare it with the Octagon steak house which I went to last year for my birthday. We ordered the table side Caesar salad and prime rib just like last year. Caster salad, the Octagon did it better but it was still fresh and delicious. However for the prime rib,we like Peter's more. I got medium rare and the meat melts in your mouth...just soo good. They only have 16 or 24 oz. Prime ribs so we got 16oz.i struggled to finish a 16oz. but it was so good, it's not the kinda struggle that you want to give it up. They also got me a slice of chocolate cake and a rose for my birthday. We're not usually fans of chocolate cakes but we devoured this one. It was not sweet at all and satisfies the appetite for dessert. 

In terms of the atmosphere,it was similar to the Octagon but because the restaurant is so much smaller the servers were walking around a lot by our table and sometimes in the way of each there which I thought was a little disturbing,just a little. I have to mention though, their front door area is very well decorated with Christmas and winter decor and scents..it smells so good I didn't want to go out into the winter storm.

We're planning to come back next time and try their table-side cooking of the fillet mignon!looked and smelled amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, INCREDIBLE service! Many delicious options to choose from. Will definitely go again soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate our anniversary. Not to overreact but this place is exquisite. Even their staff were dressed fancy! It's like one of those fine dining scenes in the movie that you see. We've been to CN 360 before and despite the location, we had better experience here. Their was a coat check, which was our first time, kinda funny, coz we thought they're gonna charge us for that, but we checked in our coat anyway. Then Tom, the gentleman who was helping us brought us promptly to our table and even put on the napkins for us. We were served with garlic bread, olives and pickles for complimentary starters. We even have fresh roses as centerpiece on our table, which we think is very thoughtful.

For appetizers, we got smoked salmon which is really good and presented very nicely. Then for our main we had Steak and Lobster and Chicken Neptune which was absolutely amazing! Even the portions were very generous! We loved every bit of it, the lobster was really fresh and taste amazing, same goes for the steak and the chicken neptune even had lobster bits on top and the hollandaise sauce really upscaled the game.

After we ate, they brought us a free dessert that says 'Happy Anniversary' on the plate accompanied by a rose which is really sweet of them! They even offered us tea/coffee to go with the cake. It just shows how much they value every person that comes in the restaurant, they make you feel very special! We are definitely coming back for another special occasion and will recommend this place to anybody looking for a great fine dining experience!"}
{"text":"The food is great from the garlic bread to the fresh made Caesar salad that is made tableside, you will love the steaks and all the side dishes Old school dinning. I guarantee you you will not be looking for a wait staff they are all so attentive to your needs."}
{"text":"This is your traditional classic steakhouse with table side service at its finest! We order the lobster bisque and Caesar Salad to start. Both were delicious and it was really fun to watch the waiter make the Caesar table side. For the main, my husband ordered the porterhouse table side and I ordered the Seafood Platter for one. The seafood and steak were cooked perfectly and we could not have asked for more."}
{"text":"visited this restaurant for a quiet meal. This was he perfect restaurant for an intimate gathering.
Get the house special prime rib. Excellent choice. Huge delicious steak.
Excellent selection of wines and drinks.
Service is excellent. They treat you with respect and class.
A bit dated for the decor, but that is what they are going for.
Lots of selections for an excellent dinner."}
{"text":"We ordered the tomahawk steak, escargots, Greek salad, and garden salad.  We came here to celebrate my birthday, so they gave a slice of chocolate cake on the house.  The service was impeccable.  My water is literally always full, it doesn't even get the chance to be half empty is how on point the service is here.  The food was delicious.  The ambience is a little antique house with classical jazz music playing in the background.  The steak is a generous amount.  We were so full, but still wanted to keep going because steak was just so good!!!!! Mouthwatering.  Wonderful experience, will DEFINITELY return.  . Thank you for making my birthday memorable."}
{"text":"I took my sister and our s/o's here to celebrate my sister's purchase of a condo. We were looking for a good place to have steak that wasn't The Keg, and wasn't downtown. Peter's was exactly what we were looking for.

I called in the late afternoon of the same day to secure a reservation last Friday night. They were very accomodating and nice on the phone. We arrived to find a good sized parking lot to the back of the building. We were greeted at the door and led to our table, where the chairs were pulled out for the ladies and drink orders were taken.

Even though they are a fine dining facility, we saw some patrons casually dressed in jeans and shirts, so it was pretty casual in here. No need to dress up super nice.

We were offered some delicious garlic bread, pickles and olives while we went over the menu.  

We ordered the Oysters Rockefellar - $19 - to share, there were 6 pieces total and all were big plump fresh juicy oysters that weren't overcooked. Very nice! We enjoyed this a lot. 

My sister and I ordered the Regular Cut Prime Rib - $36 - (nothing regular about this, this was a huge piece of tender juicy meat!). My favourite thing about this was it was soaked in the jus rather than having the jus in a tiny little sauce container on the side. Each entree comes with vegetables and a potato (fries, mash or baked).

My bf ordered the Peter's Cut Prime Rib - $44 - this thing was HUGE. It was two inches thick with the bone in. Next time I go, I will order this one so I can have the rest for lunch and dinner the next day lol.

My sister's bf ordered the Porterhouse - $50 - I didn't get to try this but it didn't look that good. And for $50, I guess it would be better next time to stick to what this place is known for and go with the Prime Rib.

We were so stuffed after the mains (we all had leftovers to take home), we didn't have any room for dessert.

I rather liked the decor of the place. It was old school looking but not at all dirty. Being a hardcore hockey fan, the hockey decor in the stairwell leading to the washroom, while a little bit random, was to me enjoyable.

My only problem was the cost of bottled imported beer. One bottle of Heineken ($8.75) cost more than a pint of Moretti ($8.50).

The ladies at the table each got a rose at the end of the meal. Nice surprise :)

I would definitely come back for celebrations or just to satisfy any prime rib cravings I might be having."}
{"text":"We really love this restaurant! Everything's perfect. From the moment we step in till the time we leave, they made their customers feel so special. 

There's a on site parking, very convenient. The lovely house  situates on HWY7 between Markham road and McCowan. We went all the way from downtown to Markham because I heard lots of good reviews from friends and family. Glad we came, we had a fun date night. Inside the restaurant is beautiful. We had reservation at 7pm Sunday night, as soon as we arrived we were greeted friendly and being offered coat checks. No need to wait and we were leaded to a nice tackle for 4. Love the lightings and piano background music. All servers in tuxedos with name tags, immediately you feel thus is the fine dining :)

Start with the cocktails. Cocktails are extensive here, more than 30 from martinis classic to signature single melts you always fine what you like. We order a Old Faction and Old Blue Eyes (Blueberry Voka with fruit juice) were both delicious. Love the wine list. They get in special wines quite often. We picked a half bottle of Cab from California. Price is very reasonable compare to other downtown restaurants. Appetizers, we ordered half dozen of oysters to share, they were so fresh. Caesar salads for two, prepared by our table side was creamy and yummy. Little on the salty side but I don't mind. I love old fashion way preparing at table side Caesar salad. Move on to the main, we ordered 24 Oz USDA bone in rib eyes at medium rear. It was juicy and delicious. Charcoal grill to perfection. We were surprised the quality and taste beat Zorro's and Tom Jone's. Very impressive. 
To end the meal, Frank made us eye catching Nutcracker coffee and Monte Crystal, they both delicious as well. 
At the end of meal, lady got a rose from owner. That makes the experience even more special. As fine dinning, price for this dinner it's reasonable as well. 

Will we come back? Answer is absolutely. It was a pleasure and we are happy."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in, you are treated like you're the boss. Coat check was offered but declined. Seated promptly on a Monday, which much to my surprise was packed. Was seated, offered a drink menu and food menu. 

After ordering a drink, the drink had arrived just a few minutes later. Food ordered. French onion soup to start, filet mignon accompanied with veggies. 

Soup arrived in 5 minutes. I though it was too fast but it was absolutely perfect. Broth was spot on. Cheese was perfectly melted. Bread crumbs were nicely tender. 

Once I had a chance to consume my soup, which took about 15 minutes, the main meal arrived. Guys the timing here is amazing. Like spot on. They've thought of everything and that's why you pay the price you do. There is not a second that they don't think of you. 

Meat was devoured and perfectly cooked. Veggies were absolutely amazing. 

This place is really good. They deliver on what they promise and that is 20+ years of amazing service. 

If you haven't been here, you should. I treated myself after moving to the area - skeptical cause I was on my own - but boy am I ever glad I did. 

I'll be back many times again. This place is a stickler for perfectionists. 

I only wish the prices that were comparable to shawarmas - but let's be honest - you get what you pay for. ++++++++++

Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"I came here for my parents' wedding anniversary. My brother and I thought we'd treat them to a nicer meal for once. First off the service is great here. They took our coats and took us to our table.

We told them we'd like to share everything and the servers were quite accommodating and helped arrange things so that we could do that more easily. We ordered a few apps to share and a few larger mains.

The highlights for me was the Prime Rib and the Tomahawk steak. Both were huge. The Prime Rib had to be about 2.5 inches thick. The Tomahawk came cut up on a platter with two sauces. The meal was meaty and it was delicious. Stuffed myself to the brim.

And at the end of the night, they presented each lady with a rose. Classy and left an impression. The price is on the high end, but I thought it was worth it for the special occasion."}
{"text":"I have been passing by Peter's for many times and wondering what's inside this standalone antique house.  Finally, I was here!  It seemed like stepping back into the past at the time I stepped inside this restaurant.  The d√©cor, wall paper, carpet and all the fixtures bought me back in time. 
We were greeted by a gentleman who looked like a classy butler.  Our server was pleasant.  We started with oyster Rockefeller, Caesar salad and bread.  The salad was tossed right at our table and it was good.  The bread came with butter which was in the shape of ball and size like a marble.  Haven't been served with butter like this for ages. We had the T-bone steak.  It was above average, but not Wowwww!"}
{"text":"A wonderful, elegant restaurant.
Our party of 3 went in on a Wednesday night and we were greeted with genuine warmth by a calm gentleman who actually asked how we were rather than just rushing us to a table. Our servers were polite and attentive without being overbearing. This is a lovely old house converted into a restaurant with wood-panelling on the walls and a green carpet on the floor. It is classy without being stuffy; everyone around us seemed to be having a good time. We really enjoyed the table-side cooking and fancy coffee preparation. The rose at the end for the female diners was a very nice touch. The vibe is definitely old-school. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Fine dining says it all! From the elegant atmosphere, to the attention to detail, to the always perfectly served fine meal...one can count on a memorable outing at Peter's.
Our party of four was warmly welcomed at the door and escorted to a beautifully set white-linen table. At some point in the evening, we were served by, or attended to by every member of the staff...including the chef.
As we placed our drink order, warm garlic bread and pickles with olives were served.
Who would think the preparation of Caesar salad table side could be entertainment!? Classically prepared by our engaging waiter, this salad was more than your run of the mill salad. It was fresh, flavourful and classic.
The meal was timed perfectly. After the salad our rack of lamb and ribs were presented, and again, everything was perfect!
It was a night of superlatives, topped off with a beautiful long-stemmed rose for the ladies. Needless to say, this will remain our go-to place for a memorable night out. Thank you Peter's!"}
{"text":"It is really 4.5 stars.

I have dined at Peter's a few times before it changes owners.  Last Sunday was my first visit under the new ownership and management.  First thing I noticed was the interior decor.  It is old school like before, but the wood trim has been freshen up, the wallpaper is new, the lighting has been upgraded.  The place was much darker in old times probably to hide the imperfection of the decor.  It now proudly allows natural light to come through the windows.  Many table lamps add a romantic European feel.  Peter's now bears a similar feel to Old Ebbitt Grill of D.C., yet it is smaller and more intimate.

We ordered a prime rib, regular cut, 18oz ($35) and a New York steak (8oz) with scallops ($45).  Without drilling on it, let me say that everything Billy K said about the prime rib was true.  It was a sensational steak, marinated and roasted to perfection.  The cut was great, the texture was tender, and it was easy to chew through.  I can't think of a better steak in recent memory, including the ones in Texas and Calgary.  My dining partner said his NY steak was rich in flavour and was a good cut.  The scallops were very fresh.

For dessert we ordered a creme brulee to share.  It was also made the old fashioned way.  I had never seen a restaurant served so many bits of fresh fruit on a brulee.  The sugar crust was thick.  I loved it.

The services was professional and gentlemen.  All the waiters were in suits.  My waiter seemed too stiff.

Peter's may not be a regular dinner restaurant for me, but it is a perfect steakhouse for occasions and to treat clients.  Plus, I will say that $35 for 18 oz of fine prime rib is CHEAP.  The rest of the entrees are all pushing $50 per plate.  Peter's is worthy of the pretty pennies that it charges though."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The atmosphere is very romantic: dim lights, slow music and the place itself is very cozy (more to the small side). Due to the small space, the tables are rather close together, which I personally didn't mind but I can see how it can be kind of distracting when you have a family of two kids beside you. 

We ordered the Caesar salad and it was the best Caesar salad I've had in my life. They make it in front of you which was pretty cool (housemade sauce) and they put Tabasco sauce in the salad which gives it a kick. Definitely would recommend this! 

For the main entrees, we ordered the prime rib regular cut and the peppercorn steak. Both were delicious and of generous size. I would say the quality of meat of the peppercorn was better than the prime rib, but if you're into a meaty taste, the prime rib would give you that. The finishing peppercorn steak was cooked in front of you at the table and the show was pretty cool. 

For dessert, we got the creme br√ªl√©e as recommended by our waiter (the service there was good as well. I wouldn't say it's the best I've had but it's expected for a nice restaurant). Definitely get the creme br√ªl√©e! It is housemade and different than the average I've had. It is super creamy and they also had blueberries and strawberries in it which is awesome. 

The only thing I wished was that the waiters would explain more elaborately when cooking table side and at the end, I felt kind of rushed as they quickly gave me the bill before we finished our dessert. 

Overall this place was amazing and the rose given to the ladies at the end was a nice way to end the night :). I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Been to several steakhouses before coming here and with all the positive reviews I had expectations...and these expectations were not met. Everything, from the food to the service, was just okay."}
{"text":"Here's a little trick for wine lovers who have put together their own special bottles. Unfortunately Peter's doesn't allow you to bring your own wine. So when I have a craving for the best steak in Markham to pair with a great Barolo, I order takeout from Peter's. USDA prime striploin charred nicely outside and medium rare or rare inside is protein perfection. Garlic bread, mashed potatoes, and get it home quick to a bottle of vino sitting in a decanter. My daughter said it's the best steak she ever had, which hurt a bit since I think I'm pretty good on the BBQ. But she's right."}
{"text":"The steak here is fantastic, but for a real treat order the dessert coffees. They are all prepared table side and watching the waiter pour flaming alcohol into your caffeine js well worth the price."}
{"text":"I've been to this place two times now and both times, I've had an excellent experience!  This place is definitely a hidden gem in Markham and the interior definitely looks way better than the exterior.  

***Food***
1) Caesar Salad ($22/person)
This is one of their signature dishes and it is a must try.  They prepare all the ingredients fresh before your very eyes with their favour giant wooden salad bowl.  The sauce is made in front of you and the romaine is fresh as can be.  I'm not usually a caesar salad eater but this was way different and just so fresh on many levels and so flavourful on many levels. 

2) Jumbo shrimp ($26)
They definitely meant it when they said jumbo shrimp.  Each shrimp was the size of my hand.  Each order comes with 4 shrimps and the best seafood sauce ever. 

3) Mermaid Platter $68
I had an excellent experience with this and I shared this with a friend (way too big to eat for one).  Our filet mignon was perfect (we ordered medium rare) and I was really impressed with how juicy it was.  Crab legs were great and they had a butter sauce for you to dip.  There was also a giant shrimp there was well, which was very flavourful.  Also, there were scallops and I'm not usually a scallop eater, but I was very impressed with how delicious it was.  

4) Prime rib $35
I had this on another occasion and it was absolutely THE BEST prime rib I have EVER tasted.  They cook the prime rib to perfection and it is just so ridiculously awesome & juicy.  I felt like I was in heaven when I was eating it.  

5) Crepes Suzette (pour deux) $22
These are crepes saut√©ed in butter, brown sugar, orange juice, cognac and flamb√©ed with Grand Marnier.  While I felt that the crepes were good, I really thought the Grand Marnier overpowered everything.  There was too much alcohol in it and I think it would have been way better if we had ordered a \"virgin\" Crepe Suzette. 

6) Apple pie ($10)
I had this the next time and it was delicious.  You really can't go wrong with apple pie unless you're at Swiss Chalet or something.  It was warmed up with vanilla ice cream on the side.  Perfect comfort food to end your meal.  

***Ambiance***
The interior is way better than the exterior.  My mother thought I brought her to some sketch place when I parked outside until we went in to the interior.  It's definitely a quiet dining place where screaming/shouting/yelling/crying is definitely not encouraged - hence why I see in some reviews that they're not kid friendly.  The demographics of people eating here on the two nights I came were couples (old & young), mom & daughters, families with teenaged & grown up children, girls night out (us), groups of young adults, and one family with a baby (who cried at the end).  

I'm sure someone is going to shoot me for saying this and no, I don't have children.  But I honestly think that while this place shouldn't have refused service to families with very young children, this is a place where disruptive crying/yelling/shouting would not be pleasant for many people.  When you're paying $50+ per person to enjoy a quiet meal, I can see why a very young infant's involuntary screaming would not be enjoable.  I don't think that parents with babies should be denied fine-dining services but I think this is one of those places where you should find a baby-sitter for the night to tend to junior while you two enjoy.  However, if you have *the perfect toddler/baby* who won't impulsively start crying/screaming/yelling, then kudos to you.  :)

***Service***
Service is top-notch.  Everyone is so sweet and friendly there.  They even give women a rose at the end of their dinner :).  It's so sweet and cute.  Both times, my server was extremely pleasant and courteous.  

***Portions***
The portion sizes, as many have already stated, are gigantic!  The night I ordered a prime rib, I could only eat half of it (because I needed room for dessert...).  They are totally fine with you taking your leftovers home and will happily pack it for you :)."}
{"text":"Called to made reservations 2 days before and they had spots. A smaller restaurant then I imagined but all the staff are all very attentive. 

Food I would actually give 3 stars. The complimentary garlic bread was a bit oily for my liking.

We got 3 appetizers to share. The escargot, oysters rockafella, and table side Caesar salad.  Get the Caesar salad as all the other Yelp reviews recommends. It's actually really good. The oysters were a bit disappointing to me. I've had way better else where. As for escargot it was alright, but again a tad bit oily to me.

We got the tomahawk ribs. It says 50oz but it's changed the 38 oz and $100 not $125. We got medium well, it came with 2 sauces and it was alright.

Over all the service was excellent but I've definitely had better steak elsewhere. But being in Markham it's a solid 4"}
{"text":"My first visit to Peter's was in 1995 for our Christmas staff party. I still remember how cozy and romantic this place was. My highlight of course was their 16 oz Rib-eye steak! Their appetizers were excellent also but wow-their Steak umm yummy. It was divine... 
20 years later, still working at the same company, we revisited Peter's to celebrate our company milestone turning 50!  Sure, decor hasn't changed much neither did the quality of their service and \"The Steak\".  I ordered 16 oz New York Striploin *aged to perfection* and I was very very happy!  
By far, my favourite restaurant in Markham!!! Great service and staff are great!"}
{"text":"This place is my favourite place in Markham to go Meatetarian!  Great atmosphere inside (think Barberian's) and the wait staff is very attentive.  They have a very cool host that works at the door - he's super tall and he kind of reminds me of Gene Simmons (this is a compliment).  They offer free parking and it's so convenient over driving to downtown Toronto to grab an amazing meal.  
I ordered the 'Peter's Cut' prime rib and received a generous portion, along with seasonal vegetables and their garlic mashed potatos.  It's so much food that you do not need to order any apps beforehand.  They did go a little heavy on the butter on their garlic bread, but it was enough to bother me, and they still get a 5 star rating from me!
Went with their New York style cheesecake and it was amazing....absolutely stuffed afterwards....but it was a 'good' stuffed.

This place has been in Markham for as long as I can remember.  If you haven't tried it, please do yourself a favour and go!  Way better than the Keg, Ruth's Chris, and Morton's.  I put it up there with Barberian's (my other fav)."}
{"text":"I have to say this restaurant is one of the best places I have been to. From the service to the food and the decor, it was fantastic. I had the New  York striploin and I have to say that is was the juiciest and most tender steak I've had. My knife just fell through meat. I will definitely be going back and I recommend this to anyone that is interested in a great steakhouse. 
The service just made the experience that much better. When we made the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion, which it was we went for a birthday dinner, they had a slice of cake waiting for after the meal for the birthday boy. They also gave the females at the table a pink rose each. What a great idea and it just made it so much nicer. It was special and unique. 
I could really keep going on about how great this was but I think you need to experience this for yourself and see how great this place really is."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this little steakhouse that's been around since 1958. The ambience is cozy and classy, with a full staff count filled with nicely dressed gentlemen who are knowledgeable in both food and wine. 

Our party of four had the crab cake, oyster rockafella, 42 oz tomahawk steak and the large bone-in prime rib. We got to share the perfectly cooked beef and it was wonderful. I saw someone making an Irish coffee for another table and it was the coolest thing (spoiler, lots of fire)

This is a fantastic place for a date or a family dinner. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food was amazing. The steak was cooked perfectly and we also got the scallops wrapped in bacon and lobster bisque. Really really recommend the scallops wrapped in bacon. So good!"}
{"text":"Try everything that is a table side service - exceptionally enjoyable to both the eye and the stomach"}
{"text":"I gave this 5 stars because the food was amazing! Service was ok. Everyone at our table loved their meal, including Prime Rib, Ribeye and the Peppercorn Steak. It's in a weird location, so don't let that throw you off!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in Markham for all you meat & seafood lovers!!

The portions are humongous. Huge slabs of meat when you order the Peter's famous prime rib - the meat just melts right in your mouth. The barbecue back ribs are meaty and they are fall-off-the-bones good!! And rack of lamb... OMG, I have never had such delicious lamb before - really juicy and tender, seared with a crispy outer layer :D I'm drooling just thinking about this lol.

I also love how they carried on the traditional art of tableside cooking. It really enhances your visual experience and you can smell the aroma while they prepare the food right in front of you - whether it is a Caesar salad, a peppercorn steak, or a flamb√© dessert :)

One more thing that I must note - they seriously take service up another notch!! This was my first time dining at Peter's for a birthday celebration. The restaurant allows you to bring a cake (+1), and does NOT charge you extra per person for caking-cutting fee. To my surprise, they presented the cake on a nice platter, servers joined in and sang 'Happy Birthday', took the cake back in and individually plated a slice of cake of each of us with a beautiful finish - chocolate drizzles, icing sugar, fresh fruits, and whipped cream :D! And to top all this, every lady receives a rose at the end! I feel extra special tehehehe... but it is actually part of their old school tradition (+1). I'm lovin' it.

Needless to say more. Overall, a great experience! I would highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely come again! What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Many friends have recommended this restaurant to me so I decided to give it a try. Upon arriving everything was fine even though I was a little under dressed and I apologized in advance. We ordered the lobster bisque, scallops wrapped in bacon, smoked salmon, chefs cut prime rib, and filet mignon. Appetizers were super salty and I barely could finish any of it. I wasn't too pleased already. Then the steaks arrived .... I had the filet and it wasn't tender at all but super dry. The server asked me how the filet was and I told him truthfully how it wasn't that great. He was kind of in shock with how unpleased I was and then started giving me attitude which I didn't appreciate. After that I just asked for the bill cause I honestly wanted to just get out of here. I wasn't expecting them to void it out of my bill I just wanted to give them feed back. 

As I was walking out the guy at the door asked me why I didn't like the filet they sell thousands of them. I then replied with I've had many filets and it didn't meet my standards plus I wasn't too pleased with the way the staff treated me and I told him to have a good night. Whether the service was shit or not I still tipped them the minimum of 20%. I'll never go back and if my friends ask me about my experience I'll tell them honestly how upset and pissed I was. I'm sure others have had good experiences and maybe they judged me on the way I was dressed. But it didn't mean I couldn't afford it. Good luck on business with the way you guys treat people."}
{"text":"I love their steaks. Great customer service too. It never disappointed me :)"}
{"text":"Really nice food. A bit pricey but very traditional. Oh did I mention, nice food. Awesome"}
{"text":"Everything was good, but for a high end restaurant I was expecting excellent. The food was tasty, a bit under seasoned.  There is an old school charm, a bit dated, ample parking. For a Friday it wasn't overly crowded which may explain why multiple servers kept asking if everything was okay (felt a bit swarmed). What was exceptional was a rose for my wife and a slice cake for our anniversary.  It was good."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, prices are very reasonable.  We had a tomahawk for $110 and a bone in prime for $50.  Only complaint is the wine list, the selection is very short with a crazy markup.  ie: 2011 Malescot for $400 when LCBO sold it for around $100."}
{"text":"Oh I didnt review this place yet! I'm shocked... what's wrong with me!!

Alright alright lets start with the most important thing when we go out to eat, the food!  Thats right lets not lie here the food is key priority for me and these guys got it right!!!  

The steaks are amazing, the salad I almost died when I had, it was just SO GOOD!  That's it, thats all I have to say the food is unbelievable you won't argue with me when you have it....Great drinks best old fashion I've had in a long time and garlic bread is good too... I'm hungry again....

So Char... why 4* (well because yelp doesn't have 4.5 thats why!).  The second most important thing is service.  I enjoyed my table side service and the present at the end 5* my friends.  But while I was there, there was a group of waiters arguing over who stole who's $50 tip... sorry for me left a very bad taste in my mouth when I see people running back and forth accusing each other of stealing money... your diners are right there, take it to the back.... also the seat they put me in was right by the kitchen and my chair got kicked like 7 times.... :(

HOWEVER, with that all said, the food is still so good you could put me in the back kitchen and have someone constantly kick my butt and I'll STILL be back... 

Oh but it's expensive... don't kid yourself and I think the prices on the website are a little off, my caesar salad (for two) was $24 think only it was $21.  Still worth it though!"}
{"text":"Not much I can say that other yelpers have not already mentioned. I guess this review is only a confirmation of what others had already said - the Best Steakhouse by far this side of Markham. Just entering the establishment numbers of awards stand testament to this claim. We had ordered their Special Peter's Prime Cut 24 oz. steak in Medium as recommended by a well palate'd friend (nonetheless) it was cooked to absolute perfection and I mean perfection. The entire 24oz piece of meat was cooked just the way we requested. now we knew we were getting beef so we also ordered a lighter fare Chicken Neptune, another tasty dish. I don't like chicken breast because it tends to be dry on the taste buds, but this chicken is an exception topped with lobster meat..loads of lobster meat, not those commercial stuff that you only sniff. Literally the top of the chicken was covered . And it has to be said, even their side dish of Vegetables were delightful. Even if they were just sides, they were given the same special attention as the main far. these dishes sang to our palates and bellies in perfect harmony.

What we loved about the restaurant (aside from the food) was their great attention to detail. Their interiors are definitely classic old school but not too stuffy. Very posh, very sophisticated. Their servers were very attentive and charming, I think that it would be such an honour to work for such a place. We couldn't picked a better place for a special occasion. The first of hopefully a long , exciting journey of milestones. Thank you Peter's for a memorable first anniversary!"}
{"text":"The Caesar salad is made tables ode for two. The peters cut prime rib is over 24oz. It is simply the best prime rib in the city. They also give every lady a rose when you leave. Very classy restaurant. Thanks for the free birthday chocolate cake. This place is a gem in markham."}
{"text":"Good place with humongous steaks. I know food can be subjective, but really, the portions were beyond huge! We took so many leftovers home! Tip: two people should share one steak and pay the $10 sharing fee, rather then paying for two steaks. It is so much meat. It was cooked well, but slightly on the salty side. 

The most memorable thing for us was actually the Caesar salad. The server grinds the Caesar base with fresh ingredients right beside your table. Yo can request for adjustments based on personal preference (i.e. More garlic; less anchovies). By far the best Caesar salad I've ever had. 

Service is friendly and attentive. Environment is dim and dated."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets 5 stars even though it's NOT the best fine dining restaurant in the GTA BUT they have been around forever (1978) and still doing a great job! Went there on my birthday for dinner. Service was good. Everyone was over 45 that works there. If you sit back and watch the dining room, it reminds you of an old school movie but a good one! Great entertainment. Food was delicious! Their 'make from scratch at your table' Caesar salad is a must!! We started off with Baltimore-Style crab cakes($16), Caesar salad, of course($27 for 2), escargots ($14) and Jumbo shrimp cocktail ($29). For dinner we had the \"peppercorn\" steak (sauce finished table-side, nice show $52) and 24oz Porterhouse ($55). For dessert, we had no room but they brought out a Belgium chocolate cake slice with a candle. The final touch was the best, every lady gets a beautiful red rose after dinner and they do this every night. Very nice! We will back for sure. Highly recommended if you're in Markham."}
{"text":"An oldie in the neighborhood, this restaurant has been around probably longer than you have. As many has passed by on Hwy 7, you most likely have seen Peter's Fine Dining before (the little house right next to Mr Sub ), but never thought much about it.

Seemingly not that big of a restaurant from the outside (and it isn't that big on the inside either), the decor has an old charm feel with plenty of dark wood decor and dimly lit candles (not sure if it's always that dark in there?). The restaurant has one floor only, with bathrooms in the basement. The restaurant itself wasn't the quietest fine dining I've been to... so if you want an ultra quiet spot, ask for one in the back.

We came here for a birthday celebration so we ordered a number of items on the menu. Some notable dishes include oysters rockefeller, tomahawk steak, escargots, filet mignon, creme brulee, and banana foster. As for the birthday person, the restaurant provides a complimentary dessert (cake from the menu) nicely decorated, and presented with a birthday song. A small, but nice gesture whenever restaurants offer that.

Their tomahawk steak is a must try; not too many places offer it, and since Peter's is known for their steaks, we decided to give it a try. And it was great! Its suggested serving is for (at least) 2 people; it comes with the bone on a small cutting board, and takes up a chunk of the table. Flavour was good; exterior was nicely seasoned and interior was the perfect colour of pink. The exterior was a little dry for my liking (even for dry aged), but the interior was on point.

The escargots were flavourful, not salty. Had it come with the shell and letting me take it out on my own I would've liked it more. Just the overall experience. The oysters rockefeller is a must try. I'll leave it at that. Their filet mignon (I believe) is on their 'ligther fare' menu, so the portion is a bit smaller, which is good if you're not a huge meat eater.

And of course, you cannot finish a fine dining experience without dessert (or any meal for that matter). There's a section of desserts on their menu that are made tableside. This involves flames FYI. We ordered the banana foster; the alcohol overpowered the dessert's flavours imo, but it was still a nice warm dessert on a cool night.

Price point: you would expect the same as is with most fine dining restaurants. Would I return? It wasn't my favourite.... not exactly 'fine dining-dining' (there were children, and some diners were dressed quite casually) but the food was good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Best steak in Markham. If you're going to splurge for a night out or a special occasion, keep this place in mind. Would recommend making a reservation the place filled up fairly quickly. Roses were given to female guests at every table. Was a really nice touch."}
{"text":"Peter's Fine Dining is an grand old restaurant that makes you nostalgic from all the old movies you watch.

It is a smaller building that is not for \"mass dining\".  Apparently they only serve a certain amount of plates a night.  

I walked in for Mother's Day at 8PM and everybody was seated promptly.  I love that nobody has to wait in line.

The service was excellent.  They checked up on my family without hovering and was very polite.

We got.
1. Baked Oysters with Spinach: These were okay, the oysters were extremely small but the way the spinach was cooked with the cheese was amazing.  I probably would not get again though.
2. Smoked Salmon;: This plate was delicious but the salmon was not spectacular.  Great to try, but wont' re-order.
3. The garlic bread was a free appetizer. This is comparable and beyond the Red Lobster bread that I am severely addicted to.  I'd come here just to chow on thiks.
4. Cream of Mushroom Soup. Soup of the day. Delicious. Creamy and filled with mushrooms but a little salty.
5. Tomahawk Steak 50z Medium Rare: This had excellent presentation but medium rare was waaay to rare.  It was almost like a blue cut. Will definitely ask for medium next time.  It came with 2 sides - vegetables and mashed potatoes. Both great choices.
6. Prime Rib: Well Done (cringe Mom). She loved it. Juicy and tender. A little pink on the inside.

We're about to go on a family vacation so we skipped dessert. But the tableside flambeed looked sooo cool.

Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy steakhouse with attentive service like you haven't seen since the jacket-required Carman's club, House of Chan 20 years ago, or even back in the day when Sheraton's Whiteside's had waiters with bowtie and made Crepes Suzette tableside. 

If you normally do not eat steak, it may seem overwhelming to order one but don't forget you can always doggy bag what your willpower gave up on and take it home for next day's lunch. You can order a 6oz. steak all the way to the 42oz Tomahawk steak.  
For those with larger appetites, try their oyster or escargot appies, or finish off dinner with a dessert or night cap.

For locals who are used to dining fast and cheap on a regular, Peter's is not fast and cheap. You come here for a dining experience to be savoured from the moment you step foot into the restaurant to the second you leave.

And for reviewers who have had bad experiences with bringing their children, I didn't see children there that evening, however, growing up and going to fine dining restaurants, my parents were always welcomed to bring us and we were toddlers, however times change and we were children that weren't raised by smartphones and tablets and we were expected to sit at the dinner table without bringing toys, learn to pay attention and carry conversation, and learned how to use cutlery (outside in, steak knife, salad knife, butter knife). I personally believe a business has the right to turn business away however uncommon it may be in Canadian culture (in Japan for example, restaurant turn away potential customers if they feel they cannot provide service to non-Japanese speakers).  

You are not a customer if you have not sat down to pay the bill for food you have not ordered or consumed. If the restaurant chooses not to serve you and kindly lets you know what type of atmosphere and ambiance they hope to achieve and maintain, YOU, dear Yelp Reader, need to be reasonable with your expectations. You are not entitled to every whim and fancy under the sun. You are not entitled to turn every public space into a home living room, an airport boarding gate, a daycare, or a mall foodcourt. You selfishly affect the dining experience of other patrons who go there because they expect a quiet evening with kids at home or a quiet evening with kids that dine sans iPad. 

Of all the steakhouses you can pick from that allow children, pick somewhere else, but don't pick an awkward confrontation that nobody wants to have with you."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here to celebrate my 30th birthday and I have to admit I was quite surprised when we arrived at this restaurant. I didn't know what to expect. Not only is the steak delicious, but the ambiance is surprisingly classy considering the exterior looks like a run down shack.  The exterior appearance shares no resemblance of the interior. The interior has the traditional ambience of what one would associate with a traditional steak house. Calm, quiet, and classy.

To start we enjoyed the Caesar Salad which was made  at our table. Everything from the dressing to the leaves were fresh. It was a bonus that the Caesar dressing was made at our table and tasted fantastic. It had the perfect amount of creaminess and spice to it too, which is how I like my Caesar dressing.

For my main I enjoyed Peter's Cut which was cooked to perfection. It was tender and juicy. IMO there could have been a tad more flavor in my steak, but by no means was it not delicious. One might say I tend to enjoy a lot of salt in my food anyway.

My girlfriend ordered a chicken dish which was alright. It tasted fine and was cooked fine, but it certainly did not resemble the quality of the steak. Although Peter's is known for its steak we were expecting a finer dish even though it was a chicken dish. Chicken and steak go hand in hand after all. 

The portions were very generous and the service was absolutely what one would expect from a fine dining restaurant.

This restaurant is a must for steak lovers that don't want to have to travel all the way downtown for a nice steak dinner."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Old Greek waiter looked like gene simmonds/ Dracula hahah. Great steak. Unreal Caesar made at the table. Pricey but in line with octagon, mortons, Ruth Chris etc great room with a distincly old school vibe. Reminded me of ceasars in Calgary - another fine steak house"}
{"text":"Peter's is a great place to eat. The service is wonderful and the food is fantastic. We ordered the Caesar salad, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, Peter's cut and banana fosters. 

The salad is nothing like anything we've ever tried before. The flavors are truly brought out with the ingredients they use. ( they crush the garlic in front of you and mix everything for the dressing)

The filet mignon was so tender and delicious, as was the prime rib (although obviously not as tender).

The banana fosters pour deux was made by our table also and was delicious.

The service was great as well considering our age ( we are fairly young), but they treated us just as well as other tables.

Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"We had our anniversary dinner here last week. Fantastic service; they offered us fresh rose and one free dessert with nice message written on it for our anniversary celebration.
We had:
1) crab cakes: made with real crab meat, tasted fresh and delicious.
2) peppercorn steak, with the peppercorn sauce made at your table. It was a fun
3) steak with scallops: both were cooked to perfection. 
4) desserts: cheesecake and apple pie, which were good but not great 

Overall, we had a good time"}
{"text":"I came here on Valentine's Day with reservations; we were seated promptly. I wouldn't recommend coming here on an occasion as they were very busy and I was not a fan of the service. First, let's talk about the food.

We ordered the Steak and Pan Seared Scallop, Steak Dianne (cooked tableside), Old Blue Eyes (cocktail), and the Nutcracker Coffee (prepared and flamb√©ed tableside). The Steak Dianne came out first as it was prepped tableside and the Steak and Scallop came immediately after that was finished. Both steaks were deliciously made. I preferred my Steak and Scallop over my partner's Steak Dianne, which is cooked in a Brandy sauce (the Brandy taste was a too strong for my liking). I also prefer my steak without any sauce. I loved my Steak and Scallop dish, mostly because of the scallop. The dish had three scallops; it was cooked in butter but the butter flavour was light enough so that it didn't overpower the scallops. Instead, it brought out the natural taste of it. The steak was also nice and a little crispy on the outside, whereas I didn't taste the crispiness in the Steak Dianne (probably because of the sauce). Inside was a perfect medium rare that cut easily.

Both alcoholic drinks were lovely. I enjoyed the Nutcracker Coffee and would definitely order it again. I really liked that the steak and coffee were both prepared tableside; it's a different experience than just having your stuff brought to you from the kitchen/bar.

All in all, the food & drinks were excellent. Now, onto the things I didn't like...

The service was not what I expected from a fine dining restaurant. This may be because I went on one of the busiest days of the year. Instead of being seated across each other, we were seated on adjacent sides of the table (like an L-shape). I thought this was unusual and from what I noticed, my table was the only one in this placement. From the moment we sat down, we felt a little rush. They had already asked if it was our first time here and we said yes. We needed time to look through the menu but they came over several times asking if we were ready to order. When we finished our meal, my partner said no to dessert (without my consent) so we called our server over again because of course I wanted dessert! He replied saying, \"that's what I just asked you and you said no.\" I thought that could've been handled better. One server also bumped into another nearby our table and he was very upset and started saying something to him in another language. I thought that was unprofessional but I think that's just the \"style\" (for lack of a better word) of the staff. I also just didn't get a good vibe from any of the servers. 

Our meal of two mains, one cocktail and one (alcoholic) coffee at the end of the meal was about $160 (before tip). I think this is very reasonable. I would return here but it would definitely be on a quieter night. 

I heard from my friend that they normally give out roses but I didn't get one : ("}
