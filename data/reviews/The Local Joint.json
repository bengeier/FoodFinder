{"text":"Very unassuming local place in fairview... But without a doubt, one of the best meals we had all week while visiting the area. We had the shrimp and grits and Cajun fried chicken, both very creative, flavorful dishes packed with local ingredients. And bonus, they have local brews on tap. The employees were nothing but helpful and charming... A must stop for anyone in the surrounding area!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place, and a year or two ago it was really good.  In the last year, though, we've gone a few times and it's just okay.  Nothing really stands out and everything is just kind of greasy.  Something must have happened in their kitchen- it used to be good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Asheville. Great food all sourced from local vendors at surprisingly cheap prices (breakfast plates from $6-9). Just wonderful."}
{"text":"This food is amazing .  Didn't think is was going to be it's beside a gas station .. Don't let the fool you go in and be amazed I had the blue cheese crusted burger with onion straw amazing you can get any topping you want on your sandwich  Onion straw and awesome and the home made chip awesome no grease cooked just right give this place a try wonderful food servers is awesome too"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. Best breakfast/brunch/lunch place in the area. Great food, great specials, outdoor seating when the weather is good. Only complaint is some of the servers can be a bit overwhelmed when they are busy. Never a wait for weekend brunch and better prices than the competition. Never dissapoints! (And did I mention the best coffee I've found in a local restaurant?) Try it!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and absolutely love this place! This restaurant is definitely an example of the phrase \"Don't judge a book by its cover\"  because even though it is attached to a gas station the food is amazing. Our family especially love the breakfast items such as the Big Bear, grits, egg-and-cheese biscuits, and omelets.  Great diner atmosphere also, with very personable wait staff.  Prices are quite reasonable; give it a try."}
{"text":"One of the best around for the food, service, and overall pleasantness.  We live in the area and so we are regulars.  You can almost go completely with the daily specials.  They are creative and delicious.  We feel so very glad to have them here."}
{"text":"The breakfast is great. I loved the grits and Fairview Benedict. My turkey Reuben was lacking enough sauerkraut however."}
{"text":"I was served a few spinach leaves literally floating in a soup of oil. It was suppose to be a spinach salad. I hope this review will allow a photo. A picture is worth more than my words. It was not served by the waitress that took my order and when she emerged she agreed and made it right but it should have never been served."}
{"text":"What a WONDERFUL diner!! Cute, clean and GREAT food! Excellent service too!! Will definitely be back. Eggplant fries....Yummy!"}
{"text":"I love the Local Joint. I go there often and and have there wonderful spinach salad with the warm dressing and local cheese. My husbands loves the burgers and homemade potato chips. The owners a great people."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and love that everything is local but the breakfast food was pretty average. Good coffee and prices were fair."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to Fairview three weeks ago, and have already been here a half a dozen times.  We've now had breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Local Joint and every meal has been on point.    Our favorites (aka everything we've eaten) -Blue Cheese Chips: hands down the best we've had anywhere, and we order them everywhere.  Cheese is not too funky or strong and the pan sauce they make is soooo creamy and delicious.  -Eggplant fries: delicious, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and the tomato chutney is good -Burger with Bacon and I can't remember what else: husband always gets this and is always happy -Ceasar salad: love the dressing and especially the cheese crisp -Fish and Chips: only on Fridays but delicious batter and a generous portion -we had a breakfast sandwich and a mushroom Benedict-kind-of-thing and loved both -Great coffee and reasonably priced wine -STRAWBERRY CAKE: only got dessert once but it was AMAZING  Rachel had been out server almost every time we've been there (the exception being breakfast) and she is fantastic.  Friendly, attentive, prompt without being overbearing.   All in all, we love this place and will make it our regular spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely great find, kinda hidden if your not looking. We stumbled upon it while stopping for gas! (It's adjacent to the actual gas station.) Fantastic food, service & prices."}
{"text":"Agree with the reviews - the food is amazing, and I wanted to give 5 stars.  However, after eating the absolutely incredible buffalo chicken chips (home made potato chips smothered with buffalo chicken, bleu cheese and cheddar cheese), we waited 25 minutes for our food (country vegetable soup and the special, a blackened chicken patty melt), with not a word or acknowledgment from the server.  We could see right into the kitchen, so we saw her discussing our order with the cook.  My husband and I have both worked in a lot of restaurants, and know that sometimes orders get missed or mistakenly made.  No problem whatsoever if the server comes and says, \"apologies - I'm not sure what happened to your order, but it's taking longer than we had hoped.\"  However, she never said a word.  Finally, the food came out, and the soup was actually chicken miso with pineapple (not country vegetable), and was not very tasty.  The special was also not very good - we were envious of all other food we saw coming out of the kitchen.  So I can only give 4 stars since the service was not very good, and the special wasn't so special.  That being said, I think we just got unlucky- this is a hidden gem that we will definitely try again."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming the worst kept secret. Good for the restaurant but bad for me. Been for breakfast, lunch and dinner. All is good! Try the bear for breakfast. A Cajun fried chicken breast with sausage gravy, bacon and cheddar on a homemade biscuit. Dinner time? Try the local burger. Staff is top notch which matches the food. Don't be put off because it's part of a gas station, it adds to the mystery and magic. You'll never believe gas station food could be soooooo good!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The food here was great and if you live or are staying nearby I would definitely recommend checking it out.  We had the buffalo chicken chips as an appetizer and split the Shrimp and Grits entree.  Some of the best Shrimp and Grits I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food,  service, not so much. We live close by and have eaten there several times. We always enjoy the food and the portions are generous. The experience is usually marred by the service, either slow service or surly wait staff. R&L"}
{"text":"Love the romaine salad, which is so much more than the name gives it credit for!  With blue cheese, pecans, fresh veggies a yummy house-made raspberry vinaigrette and some grilled chicken, it's fabulous! We also love the buffalo chicken chips appetizer, and the night specials are AMAZING!!  The Food Network really needs to visit this place. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  The shrimp and grits were great as was the Cajun chicken.  The grit and homey cake was excellent.   We also enjoyed the Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"Every thing is always dry and/or overcooked.  Overpriced while mediocre"}
{"text":"Always excellant food and great service ! Black Bean burger rules and the dish tacos !  Today haddock was on the menu so I chose the hamburger !  Anastasia is the best server too!"}
{"text":"Typically a busy place, but for a good reason. The food here is delicious, surprised the crap out of me for somewhere attached to a gas station. I've been here a couple times, my favorite dishes included a filet over mashed potatoes, braised greens with bacon, topped with a blueberry chili goat cheese...UM EXCUSE ME? Came for breakfast to try the other end of the spectrum, and ordered the Huevos Rancheros...delicious and authentic. I'll keep coming here, without a doubt."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here two days this week and it was great! We were hesitant about a place attached to a gas station but we were very pleased. It was more like a local diner with very fresh ingredients. We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If you're in the area and hungry, do yourself a favor: stop here and eat. What a great discovery that I would have totally missed without Yelp!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Fresh ingredients with lots of locals as customers. I had to get past their unique location- not your usual food for a restaurant attached to a gas station."}
{"text":"We've been in North Carolina for 10 days and this was the best lunch we've had!   Cuban made with pulled pork, home made mustard and pickles served with home made chips was excellent. Sweet potato fries also delicious! The diner decor is charming. Nothing negative to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Being from Fairview, I go to The Local Joint several times a week.  I've probably done breakfast, lunch and dinner an equal number of times, week days and weekends, so I feel I'm writing a solid \"report\".    In some aspects, I absolutely love The Local Joint.  It's wonderful to see a business finally \"make it\", in this particular spot, where so many have failed.  It's even more wonderful to have a restaurant in Fairview who uses local farmers and merchants and cares about good, quality, local and organic foods, beers and wines. With that said:  THE GOOD:  A pretty unique menu consisting of mostly good food, made from a lot of local farmers and merchants.  Warm, fun, local environment when you're there with your neighbors or friends, especially on a cold morning  (with good coffee!!) ; a nice local gathering spot.  THE BAD:  The wait staff.  While they are all different ages and personalities, they all seem to have a common thread....and its NOT a good one;  A apathetic attitude and a sense of entitlement.  I've seen 1 female server with a friendly attitude but all of the rest of the waitstaff seems to be hurried, stressed out and very angry or unhappy.    THE UGLY:  ATTITUDES.  None of the wait staff seem to give a SH*T if you are there or not and most all of them act as if THEY are doing YOU a huge favor by waiting on you OR as if you are encroaching upon them if you ask more than 1 question.  GOD FORBID if you ask more than one question or have a special request; they don't bother trying to hide their displeasure and dirty looks.  One of my friends who I dine with often has food allergies and simply must ask questions!!  Some of the servers do little \"huffs\" and one female server  (who seems to be there all the time and works every station) all but rolls her eyes at you every time you say or ask anything.     I also have to say here that I have put in my years as wait staff, in every environment from Mom & Pop greasy spoons to 5-star restaurants, so I know the life.  I know how ugly the public can be and I know how you can be treated and then not get tipped or make any money from it, THEREFORE servers have my empathy and I always treat wait staff with respect and I always tip well, even when the service is less than ideal.  (I've even tried tipping the one really obnoxious female server there really well to see if it would make a difference in how she treats me the next time I come in.  Nope.  She doesn't care.  She's always just as impatient and obnoxious every single time.)  HOW DO THESE PEOPLE KEEP THEIR JOBS?     The cook staff doesn't seem any better.  Often their eyebrows are furrowed in the most unhappy and even angry expressions.  Are they unhappy or hung over or just plain miserable, or what??   I've heard the wait staff and cook staff fussing and snapping at each other. \"Why is this here?\"  \"Where's my ____?\"      If you go to the counter at the end to place or pick up a To Go order, the cook staff will be all over the place within a foot in front of you and will not even bother to look up to see if you need anything.  I realize that's not their job but I really don't think it would kill them if they could at least look up, make eye contact and at least smile.  I don't know....maybe a few of the rigid faces would, indeed, break, crack and fall off.  Fairview as a whole is such an artsy fun community and most people in Fairview have really great attitudes. All of this negative stuff seems SO OUT OF PLACE in Fairview!!!!   Attitudes like this usually \"trickle down\".   If management or the lead wait staff have horrible attitudes, they tend to hire people with the same \"energy\" or \"vibration\".   I've heard good things about the owner of The Local Joint, so I have to wonder....is it coming from her?  Or is she too far removed from the daily grind and it's coming from her management or lead staff?  Whatever the source of it is, I sure hope the owner sees this and has a wakeup call.  As much as I love my little local restaurant, I'm afraid my experience there yesterday was just about the last straw.   I've tried to look over it, and focus on the good aspects and I've tried to deal with it but I think I've had about enough of the really negative attitudes and I think it's worth it to drive further into Asheville, to the restaurants where you're treated as valued and appreciated.    It's a P-I-T-Y."}
{"text":"Two challenges to begin with: (1) I am a good cook and have been eating very fresh farm to table meals from local farmers markets and (2) we just had finished a local farm tour and were starving for fresh food. This place was not in our normal dining area, but I \"Yelped\" it of course, to find out where we should eat. I should have paid attention to what kind of food the previous reviewers of this place were reviewing: breakfast or brunch. We went for dinner. Had the ribs special and fish tacos. Never, never, never should I get food that is cold, or less than lukewarm. We got the ribs because of the waiter's suggestion. They looked like it had been sitting there awhile, with some sauce spread on it. And great ribs are fatty, but at the right temp, you don't see all the fat. I saw and tasted fat. The fries were cold. I asked for fresh fries, and they came out with old fries that had been re-fried. I got the fish tacos because the waiter said the fish was red snapper. I should never smell fish when it is brought to the table. First sign of disappointment. I know red snapper, we just had fresh fish at home last week, and this did not taste like red snapper to me, but perhaps it was frozen, which could make a difference. Second disappointment on the fish is that the menu stated it came with avocado. None on the plate. I had to ask for it. And the tomatoes in the pico did not appear to be fresh either. I don't mind paying for food that is good, hoping that it would be great, but I kicked myself in the butt all the way home. I was so disappointed that I will not give this place a second chance, even for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you. It's in a gas station strip mall on a scenic highway in the mountains. I had the shrimp & grits - maybe the best I've ever had. Definitely stop in if you're anywhere near Asheville."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had the Cuban Panini, very good!  To reiterate other posts, don't let the location fool you!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Fairview bemoaning the fact that I would be further from great food this far from downtown Asheville. Then, we discovered the Local Joint. Excellence in every thing we have tried, a level of cuisine fully at odds with its gas station location, and an experienced, competent staff. The hamburgers have the perfect relationship of meat to bun, and my favorite, the Fairview Burger, which has grilled cheese mixed with onion fried on top, is truly a great burger. Just as good, the French toast, is the best I have ever had. Deb loves the salads and other breakfast items. We eat there at least three times per week and i look forward to sampling everything on the menu. This is an outstanding restaurant and equal to any of the more well known eateries in Asheville. You will enjoy it!  I have now eaten here at least 20 times, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There is nothing on the menu that isn't top notch. In particular, the French Toast is the best I have had, and the meatloaf dinner elevated with a wonderful demiglaze. Don't miss this great restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it!!! Can I post an 8-Star review instead of just 5?!?! The food is homemade, locally sourced, and extremely well done by the kitchen.  The service is always friendly and engaging; they truly live into the concept of being \"the local joint\".  It's a lifestyle for them, not just a name. Breakfast is dynamite, with lots of unique and creative options to choose from, along with some tried-and-true favorites for the less creative palette. I dine here as much as possible, and will keep coming back, again, and again, and again..... LOVE IT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this on our way out of Asheville. Fast, friendly service and the food was delicious. Don't let the outside fool you (it's connected to a gas station/convenience store); this is local food done right. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here for the first time this morning and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. When you pull up the restaurant is connected to a gas station and that caught me offguard quite a bit. Once you enter the facility the The decor and vibe that is put off is definitely true to the Asheville culture. The waitress that we had was especially friendly and provided excellent service to us for the extent of our meal. I ordered the coffee, big bear breakfast sandwich, and an omelette. I was very impressed with my order and it was all reasonably priced as well. Needless to say don't let the outside appearance turn you away because the food is amazing and the people are great. I would definitely go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I ordered the Corned Beef breakfast. It was a joke. I counted 3 small shavings of corned beef in a a cup of hash browns with 1 egg. Cook got very angry when I asked if I got the wrong meal. Terrible service and a Rip off!"}
{"text":"Chanced upon this place after a hike at bearwallow mountain, and we are so glad we did! My husband said it was the best burger he has had, and my chicken philly was out of this world! Reasonable prices, and they also have everything from local beers to sangria to bloody Mary's.  We will definitely be back! This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting adventure for Fairview.  The service is very good and the food is excellent.  Their outdoor tables give a breath of fresh air to spring in the country.  We go there after church on Sunday AMs.  They did not offer the omlet I wanted but were more than willing to make it."}
{"text":"This place I really liked. It's very laid back atmosphere and the waitress was extremely nice. The diner is right next to a gas station mart, but the food is very good. I had the romaine salad with chicken breast, my son had the chicken Philly sandwich, and my daughter had penne with shrimp. I like that they were open until 10. The food was prepared when ordered and right in front of us."}
{"text":"Very good meal and a great value! Love the number of local sources they use. We both ordered the Big Bear. A large bowl was filled with a huge fresh biscuit, open faced with two slices of applewood bacon, large breaded chicken breast, melted cheddar and good old southern style sausage gravy. Yum! I'm thinking we may return before our trip home! Excellent hot and fresh coffee and super friendly service too!"}
{"text":"The local scramble is delicious.  My husband had the local omelet and enjoyed it.  Great service and good food!"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviews in that it is located at the back of a gas station and it does look a little sketchy. But I have eaten at the Local Joint a number of times and have never had a bad meal. The Pork Tenderloin is fantastic, as is the Reuben sandwich. I have had their fish fry which is their Friday night special. The Haddock is cooked to perfection. Saturday night is Beef rib night although when they came to the table they were clearly Pork Baby Back Ribs. As we were looking forward to Beef ribs we were disappointed at first, but the Baby Backs were delicious. We would definitely have them again."}
{"text":"My wife had the best breakfast of the week here called the Big Bear. Mine was more standard , but also excellent. Best place out in the middle of nowhere to eat!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I enjoy their breakfast very much,  and the have a delicious selection of cakes for desert as every good diner type of place should. The staff was great and I look forward to returning even though every time I go there I have to sleep on my side for the next couple of days while the food digests."}
{"text":"What a surprise. Wonderful brunch selection (huevos rancheros was amazing). And to make it even better, they have local brews on tap! Fairview has a great food scene."}
{"text":"Wow what a gem!...this place is a great place to grab some lunch if you are in the area or not too far from...make the short drive.  The service was TOP NOTCH.  Talk about southern charm...this is the place for that.  Great local mom/pop cafe with southern hospitality!  I chose the Pastrami on Pretzel bun...HOLY COW!!!  Tender, juicy, fresh bun...it could not have been any better.  The house chips that accompanied was a great side and my spouse had the fries with her meal, but after tasting I prefer the house made chips so give those a shot on your visit.  If you want to hang out, grab a local beer, and/or have a lunch do yourself a favor and stop in.  They always have daily specials which would be worth a go.  I hear their breakfast is not too shabby either!"}
{"text":"A great little place! Something for everyone - meat eaters and vegan. Good prices and delicious food. They really care about incorporating as much local as possible. I'd choose this place over any restaurant chain. The portion sizes are huge too- there's always leftovers."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here twice. Both times the food was really good! My wife's mother lives like 5 minutes away and over the last 8 years we have only eaten here twice, but after our breakfast this morning we decided we are going to eat here every time we visit!   The gravy over their biscuits is ridiculously flipping amazing! The biscuits are just ok, but that gravy... holy crap it's good! My wife had the eggs Benedict and it was very good as well. We decided as we were eating that we might like to try some lunch food.... and so we ordered the blue cheese chips appetizers and it was an excellent decision! When the chips first arrived we were worried cause the looked dark and burnt, but upon inspection from our mouths we realized they were delicate and delightful! Then the blue cheese hits you on the back of the tongue and Kapauyaw! Great flavor and so smooth!   We can't wait till our next visit! It will definitely be a regular spot for us from now on! Shame on us for not going sooner and more often already!"}
{"text":"Just had an awesome breakfast at this little gem of a restaurant!! We'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of a diner - no real ambience but awesome food.   This is our second time here. First time was for dinner and we had the taco special which was outstanding!  Today my husband had the French toast special which was delicious. I had the Cuban with sweet potato fries, which were great. Definitely a must try eatery!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Friendly wait staff. Excellent, fluffy, huge pancakes. Best reuben my husband has ever had. I enjoy their omelettes and caramelized bacon burger."}
{"text":"Offers a wide variety of menu items, with new creations from the chefs featured regularly. For the most part service is good, although a few of the servers exhibit a lackadaisical attitude and lack of attention to your table. I find that eating at the bar always means excellent service, direct from the cooks and barkeep.   Nice selection of local brews and national standards. Great place to take friends or family for a relaxing meal that's high quality without the exorbitant prices of some Asheville-area restaurants."}
{"text":"Went for brunch & ordered nachos & coffee. The restaurant used lots of locally sourced ingredients. They have turned an old huddle house into a pretty little diner with a clean vibe. The kitchen staff could be more professional but the table service was excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome staff. Awesome food. Awesome prices. Best burger in town. Real small town diner vibe. Fairview is gorgeous too  so its worth a trip down charlotte hwy."}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast on a whim and I am glad we did.  We had a few different things from the menu, but once we saw the scramble that one of our guests ordered we were all jealous.  Every thing was delicious!!!  The service was great and my coffee cup never got less than half full.    Don't miss this on the way to Chimney Rock!"}
{"text":"Just really, really, delicious food.  Egg & cheese sandwich was wonderful, as was the burger and sweet potato fries.  The blue cheese homemade chips were rich and flavorful.  The coffee is also really nice.  Do yourself a favor and stop by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Fairview is so lacking in restaurant choices, so I was very sad to see Sugar Beets go. But then, The Local Joint opened up and they have filled that void. Lots of yummy choices for breakfast, lunch AND now dinner (yay!). My favorite menu items are the Reuben and the spinach salad with the warm onion vinegarette. Good hummus trio & housemade chips as well. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. Good food- such nice people, and the best ranch dressing you'll find anywhere in town. It's 5 minutes from our house and it's our go to place when we can't figure out what to do for dinner. They have amazing burgers!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Great food. We call it ole faithful, cause it's always consistently good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend found this restaurant on Yelp while we were visiting Asheville. We are obsessed with brunch (who isn't?) and really looked forward to a delicious brunch at a local place. When we pulled up, I'll admit I was a little disappointed. It's next to a gas station, and I asked my boyfriend if he would like to go elsewhere since I don't trust gas station food.  I'm glad he told me that he wanted to try this place out.   So, this restaurant is connected to a gas station, but it does not have a gas station vibe once you get inside. The decor is funky and classic, and the booth seats really bring a retro vibe to the entire restaurant.  Service was fantastic. Our waitress was very quick and friendly. She made sure our drinks never got low (which is wonderful, because I hate sitting around needing a refill on coffee and never getting one). She told us about the special, but I decided to get the Fungi (it is sort of like eggs benedict, but instead of ham it is mushrooms) with a side of breakfast potatoes. Get it, it's delicious. The eggs were perfectly poached and the flavor was incredible. The potatoes were salty and fried perfection.  My boyfriend got the local scramble, and it looked amazing. I had a bite and I would say he may have ordered better than me, but it depends on your mood. I would definitely return here if I come back to Asheville.  Oh, and for two breakfasts, a coffee, and two beers, our bill came out to be $25. Talk about a deal."}
{"text":"Great breakfast menu. I'd love to come back for lunch or dinner next time I'm in town. If you're here for breakfast, it's best to get there early as they fill up fast. The decor is a blend of old school diner and hippie. So very Asheville. I had an omelet and it was a great portion and the ingredients were flavorful and fresh. One of my friends got pancakes and they were huge!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the staff was a lot of fun!! Wish I had a chance to try the deserts but I fills up on my delicious corn beef hash and grits! Awesome hot sauce selection too ;)"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here.Good is average but eggs too runny.Highlight is their biscuits.Maybe I just ordered wrong.Morgan liked her veg eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! Don't let the fact it's attached to a gas station deter you from checking this place out. I promise you that you will be amazed and glad you stopped in.  I love the vibe of this place really cool atmosphere and enjoy the fact all the food products and meat come from local farms and businesses!  The service is always on point been here several times and never had any problems with service. The staff is always up beat and  have very positive attitudes. The cooks are amazing Terry is awesome and friendly and quite frankly cooks some damn good food! I usually come here for breakfast before work and always try the specials. My favorite so far was the Prime rib eggs benedict it was OMG good! Been coming here more and more for lunch and dinner! Honestly have to say everything I have tried I enjoyed and would eat again! If you are ever driving through Fairview stop in and check this amazing place out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like a diner but i don't like that place.There food were not my favorite because i don't like there food because i wish they have better food that they will make for a diner."}
{"text":"I have tried the fish tacos with pico & homemade potato chips for lunch which was very good. I had it with the mango margarita & it was a great combo! Dinner time I tried the pork tenderloin served with wilted spinach & mashed sweet potatoes with figs it was delish I had a reg margarita was not as good as the mango. The hub had the angel hair pasta it was so good!!  Overall great experience! love it! Great place we will be back to try breakfast too!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars - my family stopped here after hiking and got our hopes super high after reading reviews and seeing the set-up/decor of the place. The food was pretty good, not not anything awesome and they were small portions. Even though it was 2pm, I ordered off the breakfast menu! I got the poached eggs with mushrooms and goat cheese on English muffin. It was tasty for sure but I'd probably order another breakfast item next time! It came with grits and maybe I just don't know a lot about grits, but they were too buttery yet flavorless in my opinion. They were still good to help me fill up though! My dad ordered the 3 fish tacos but it was just one skinny piece of fish laid across 3 tortillas which I found almost humorous. My brother got the Cuban, which is what they're known for and wasn't wow-ed by it. Our server was very nice and this is a cool spot but not the very best food."}
{"text":"We are very lucky to have a café of this quality in Fairview, NC.  Their beverages, beer, tea, coffee are all top notch.  Their salads, sandwiches and breakfast items are very good. I especially like their grits, their romaine salad and the local burger. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"A great local place with comfort food and soul food done with excellence.  The Big Bear is a must for breakfast.  And the Reuben sandwich is worth the trip! Classic diner attached to a gas station but is separated by a double glass door.  Unique ambiance with great food prep!  The only critique is the soup portion was pretty small. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Get The Fairview on the breakfast menu! Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Yummy menu of great choices -  very reasonable prices - nice staff - good music - groovy little Joint I love this place.. It's not super fancy or gourmet just a diner w above average diner food w a hint of hippie/punk rock-ness to it. I'm so glad this is here, there's no other place at all to eat out this far worth anything really. I mean.. Bad food, period. This is always good food and a pleasant experience - they always make my daughter pasta which is not on the menu and put up w out antics"}
{"text":"While the food is good, it is a bit on the fancy side for my taste - and pricey.  The lunch menu isn't that expensive, but dinner really is - especially to be located in a gas station."}
{"text":"Impressive quality, price and quantity. Wait staff was great. Of all the places to eat in the area, this place should be on your short list!"}
{"text":"Adore this simple place. Good quality affordable food. This is an Asheville esque restaurant outside of Asheville. Stays busy enough so you know it's good but never too busy that you can't find a seat.   It is a little out there- in fairview. Good place when going to/coming from a hike.   Great veggie options. Also simple and fresh. Healthy comfort food. Great fish tacos. Try the fresh pressed juice. Yum!Awesome service."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. And great atmosphere! We stopped at this fun little diner on our way to DuPont and I had the Local Scrambler. Everything about it was good. The perfect sized portion, great quality, perfectly warm and so delicious! Everything from the potatoes to the toast to the butter just seemed wholesome. They give you a dollop of fresh, thick butter rather than just placing plastic packages of land of lakes on the table like Most breakfast joints. We walked right in and we sat immediately. The server came by our table just enough that we weren't ever waiting too long for our food or our checks. She offered us ketchup and hot sauce and everything we would have asked for but didn't have to. I'd highly recommend this place if you're in the area. Skip the expensive brunch spots with long waits and bad service!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The service was possibly the worst I have received in North Carolina as a whole. The company I was with are well acclaimed chefs in the Asheville. The poached eggs were raw which is not the server's fault. However her attitude was the kicker of it all. She NEVER checked on us after our food was served. Two of us were done before I finally flagged down another server to explain how disappointed we were. The server came over and questioned my friends comment about the eggs being raw and had the audacity to state \"I don't think you're a liar.\"  Needless to say this is the first and last time we will be here. I hope the gratuity we left sends a statement."}
{"text":"The Local Joint is a cute place tucked next to a gas station.  The food was really good.  We had the meatloaf special and the portobello burger.  Both were good but not overwhelming.  The service was a bit slow.  Our waitress kept stopping what she was doing to chat with people including other staff.  While we were not in a hurry, it got to the point where we were bored sitting there waiting on her.  It was not busy.  I would still recommend going.  I am sure the other staff members are not as talkative."}
{"text":"We loved this place and ate there a handful of times. We are from Fairview, so having a good restaurant in the neighborhood is nice.  Unfortunately, I got food poisoning from their buffalo chicken sandwich.  I have since found out that another family in Fairview had the same experience.  I write this only in the hopes that they will take steps to correct their problems, so my family and I can feel safe eating there again and supporting local."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!!  You would never think a place like this would be right off the interstate, next to a gas station!  The food was amazing!  I had the fried chicken with Brussel sprouts, fried grit cake and a honey jalapeño glaze.  My husband had the fried fish special. Everything was so good and the portions are huge!  The staff was very friendly and very attentive.  I think we are going back for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.  It has been a couple of months since my wife and I dined here - last night, we were in the area and decided to stop by for dinner. I ordered the pork sliders with the house made chips and she ordered the fried chicken special. Once our food arrived, this is where my once great impression of this place was sullied.  First, my pork sliders. The sandwiches themselves were fine, but there were a few chips that appeared to be not fully cooked and had a limp, rubbery texture. I ate them regardless, they were still decent but just tasted like raw potatoes with seasoning...not a big deal. My wife's dish was a different story.  She began to eat the chicken, and it was ok at the start. However, once she reached the middle part of the chicken the meat had a pink hue to it - we assumed at this point that the meat was not cooked fully so my wife sent it back to the kitchen. Since this is an open diner, we could see everything that the cook was doing (including his annoyed facial expressions) and watched, in horror, as he simply threw the 1/4 eaten chicken back into the fryer. This, of course, made the dish a greasy mess, not to mention the potential sanitary issues of throwing a partially eaten piece of food back into a fryer where other customer's dishes were being served (yes, I'm aware that the grease is hot, but still...that's disgusting). We could tell from our server's expression when handed the plate back that she really did not want to bring it back to us, further evident when she took it away almost immediately after realizing that my wife would not be eating the greasy mess placed before her.  This was the coup de grâce to a mediocre meal at best. The cook staff used to be completely solid and consistent here - I can't remember a time where we ever had to send anything back to the kitchen (other than a clean plate). I would have been more forgiving if the place had been busy at the time, but, unless there was a massive rush before we got there, it wasn't busy at all.  The only positive thing I can say for the experience is that our server was extremely nice and very attentive. I felt sorry that she was representing food that she probably wouldn't have eaten. We have had this place cater several functions that my wife organized and the food was always top notch, it's unfortunate that the kitchen has seemed to take a downward turn."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for breakfast on the way to Lake Lure/Chimney Rock!  Clean and friendly little diner on a gas stop strip mall. Very cute interior and very good food. This was the best breakfast we had in Asheville. We truly enjoyed it. Would definitely come back again if we are back in the area."}
{"text":"Yes,  it is attached to a gas station off a high way. Total diners, drive-ins, and dives feel going on here.  All local food products, great service and they'll learn your name and peculiarities if you give them the chance. I have never gone wrong with a special, currently finishing up the pot roast with fried shoestring potatoes on top. NOM, NOM I SAY!  When you decide you're going to become a regular make sure you get a punch card, it's like racking up free meals at your favorite place. Try the big bear and ask for the firewalker hot sauce for my favorite breakfast option.  It's also a good idea to go ahead and like them on Facebook to stay up to date on what that meals specials are.  One time they had an amazing fried bologna with fried green tomato sandwich lunch special that I missed, I Facebooked them about it the following morning and they still made it happen.  These are truly good people!"}
{"text":"The Local Joint is right on the highway, connected to a service station. Their menu is imaginative and they serve breakfast till 3 pm. We just popped in for lunch and it was exceptional. My friend had the daily special: grilled chicken, bacon, Brie and spinach on a focaccia roll, tarted up with Lusty Monk mustard. My choice was a Rachel (Reuben with turkey instead of pastrami). Both were served with delicious house made potato chips.    We'll be back for breakfast tomorrow."}
{"text":"Heard about this new restaurant while visiting family in Asheville. It exceeded our expectations. The chef uses local ingredients and puts twists on American favorites. We werehungry, so we tried several different items. We ordered appetizers...I have never had eggplant fries, but they were awesome. The chutney that comes with it is smokey and just plain comfortable. We also had the nachos. Homemade potato chips are made each day. Piled high with chicken, cheese, sour cream, and bacon, where could you go wrong? Basically we couldn't stop eating them. For my main meal, I ordered the biscuits and gravy. I'm a bit picky about my gravy, but this gravy was different; sweet, spicy, and I couldn't stop eating it. The biscuits (also homemade) were light and fluffy. My husband had the cuban panini. There was minimal talking once these dishes came. It was SO good.  The decor is CUTE! The chalkboards perfectly display drink specials (local beers on tap) and other pertinent information! The chef came over and asked us how the food was. The entire staff was warm and inviting. We will definitely go back and recommend anyone in the Asheville area to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Walked in just before closing..  They insisted I stay and eat. That got them that last star. Food was excellent as was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"2nd breakfast in as many days here.  This place is amazing.  The big bear is one of the most tremendous breakfasts I've ever had, the local scrambler is awesome, and the waitresses are pretty!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast one Friday.   Let's start with one important detail, the portions are HUGE. Big portion sizes didn't impact the quality of the food, everything we ate was fantastic. The Big Bear sandwich was a monster, but delicious. Huevos Rancheros and Corned Beef Hash were also hits. The sausage gravy was to die for. I would highly recommend this place for breakfast and would be excited to see what they had to offer at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast/lunch their today(April 6th).  It was our first visit.  Jordan(our server) suggested we start with the eggplant frites  with a tomato dipping sauce(add some hot sauce to make it extra great), and they were delicious.    I had the sausage and gravy for my meal and it was SO amazing;  Lots of great flavor and the biscuits were really nice and fluffy.  My friend had the Local Breakfast and a side of cheese grits,  he liked his meal and commented how delicious the grits were.    Overall, great job!  I'll be making a trip there again very soon.    They have outside seating too and are dog friendly, so those are also extra benefits."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way to Asheville and the breakfast was delicious. I got the fried egg sandwich on their home made biscuit with avocado, tomato, and a pesto Mayo. My husband ordered the Western omelet, which was a very large order. We also loved the little diner atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The food is okay but nothing special.  We decided to have breakfast here after reading the reviews.  Live and learn.  The place is nice and our waitress was great.  The food is just not good and the price for it is not either."}
{"text":"Great spot to fuel up and looking for a great meal, as my friends and I were finishing a bachelor party weekend, we went in to grub.  The look and feel of a roadside diner, charming waitresses filled with personality and smiles. Great menu selection with all the classics.  I got Eggs Benedict and Grits,  was filling, neatly prepared, good coffee and a full tank!"}
{"text":"I had the Mahi fish tacos and they were amazing! The tortillas must have been made in house, they were delicious. Great food and staff, we loved it!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. My partner got the local scramble, 3 over medium eggs with peppers, onions, potatoes, cilantro, chicken sausage, ham, and jack cheese. I got the bear sandwich, which had Cajun fried chicken, bacon, sausage gravy, and cheese on a fresh biscuit (I think that's what it was called) and it was so great! We split a pancake and asked for a side of their sweet and spicy pecans to put on top. Service was excellent and our meal was about $20, which was a deal! Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Plenty of parking. The name of the restaurant fits, so come here and brunch or lunch and support local businesses! I ordered the veggie eggs benedict and we shared the brussels sprouts appetizer - which was absolutely delish. Both are pictured."}
{"text":"Absolutely delish! Brekkie or dinner - I was so surprised and impressed with the tasty vegetarian choices, too. Great tempeh burger and breakfast veg eggs Benedict.   You can get gas and a car wash there, too!  Go once, you'll go again and again."}
{"text":"Use to love this place.  Just drove out of my way to eat there.  11:40am....not busy.  Basically a server for every table.  I sat for 10 min and NO ONE came to greet me or ask for my order.  This is the reason why as wonderful as some as the food is some of the Asheville restaurants are, the service is what destroys the business!  Needless to say I left...."}
{"text":"5 stars without question.  This place is 20 miles from my house in Candler, but I will be back time and time again.  Even though it's tucked away in a gas station, Local Joint could easily thrive downtown alongside some of the legends of Asheville.  The burger I had was easily among the best 3 I've ever tasted, and my wife said that she has never had sirloin prepared so perfectly in her entire life, no exaggeration.  The prices are spectacular for the quality that you get, and the pride in local sources makes it fit right into the AVL scene."}
{"text":"Good variety of food, simple menu, and trendy atmosphere.  Friendly service, however groups larger than 4 must sit at multiple tables.  Enjoyed a simple egg and cheese sandwich with avocado on toast.  A fried chicken breakfast sandwich was much bigger.  Grits were also good.  Brewed iced tea with plentiful refills."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for this wonderful quirky restaurant, which is kinda off the beaten path, but worth checking out. Next to a gas station, with that faint waffle house vibe, LJ has much to offer, including a smidge of attitude. Open 7A-9P weather permitting. Most offerings are under $10, dinner entrees slightly more.  The menu has amazing specials, sandwiches, burgers, delicious breakfast combos, and blue cheese chips! Love the fish tacos, eggplant fries, tempeh melt, and yummy pork sliders. Fresh homemade soups daily. Our group is partial to breakfast, served 7-4 m-f, and 8-3 sat. and sun. Faves are the Fairview, with eggs, avocado, roasted tomato, spinach and hollandaise on a muffin, and the local scrambler, with chicken sausage, jack cheese, cilantro, roasted tomatoes, served with luxurious home fries. To die for. Yup, there are biscuits too  -fluffy, big, awesome, hot.  The Salmon, and pork tenderloin are our picks for dinner unless a special beckons. Oh, and don't pass up those yummy desserts, like dark chocolate cake, we always get one and share.   Be prepared for noise, as it's always bustling and sometimes there is a small wait but it's worth it. Don't worry about ambiance, there isn't any! There is heat, and the striped curtains are retro, but you'll be more interested in your plate or the conversation next booth."}
{"text":"I'm saying A-OK because, as a group, we had a bad experience.  The food wasn't bad, but getting the food was an issue.  We had an hour scheduled for lunch & didn't get out for two hours.    It was interesting watching a cook walk by the table a couple of times and eyeball us because he KNEW something was wrong.  It was exceptionally bad because we had already asked the waitress about getting our food and she said it was on the way.  So, even later she came back & said she didn't know what happened but the kitchen didn't get our order.  It was nice that the owner/manager came by after that & took 1/2 off the bill.  Even though this first experience was not the best, the food was good and I would go back again and give it a second go."}
{"text":"We had a great meal at The Local Joint tonight.  Hard to believe this place is a strip next to a gas station.  Great homemade hummus appetizer- loved the chunky texture and flavors (3 different kinds) with generous portions of veggies and soft pita.  Eggplant fries?!!! Loved them.  Hubby had the local burger (carmelized bacon, blue cheese and garlic aioli) and he raved about it. I had pastrami sandwich (think they make it in house) with creamy slaw, house made pickles etc. on a pretzel bun.  Fantastic \"wet\" sandwich.  Housemate potato chips- excellent and crispy (not soggy like a lot homemade chips). Excellent meal at a great price!  Go when you're nearby!! Worth the drive to make it nearby."}
{"text":"Really good food!  I had the black bean burger. (Which you have to ask them to make as a burger.) The patty is actually under the salads.  House made and full of flavor. I had the chipotle mayo on mine. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Good clean food, great service. They don't waste any time here. The Fairview breakfast rocks and the applewood smoked bacon is out of this world"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I like this place. The food is really tasty with some unique items on the list like Brussels fries and eggplant fries (which are super tasty). Today I had the bbq pork sliders. Pretty solid. The hubby knocked back the local burger which was piled high. Secret...always always always...asl for a side of pickles. These are my favorite things here. Homemade spicy pickles!  Pretty much anything you get is going to leave a smile on your face. So go for it!"}
{"text":"The Local Joint is absolutely delicious!  My favorite restaurant in Fairview and certainly worth the trip from Asheville too!  They have great food and a good selection of local beers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the Asheville area, and I think I've eaten at almost all of them.  My wife and I make the drive out to Fairview monthly just to eat some delicious food.  The building is in a weird strip mall, connected to a gas station.  Do not let this location fool you, it's where you find the best food.  The service is attentive, the chefs are friendly, and the food is all homemade and locally sourced.  It is really affordable compared to some Asheville restaurants.  Some of my favorite items are the Big Bear breakfast biscuit (cajun chicken, smoked bacon, a biscuit, gravy) for 5.99!!  The ribs on Saturday nights are juicy, big, and delicious.  Great burgers, great dinner specials, affordable, delicious!!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place totally lived up to the hype. Incredible food and decent service. Definitely some room for improvement on the costumer service side but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"First things first, The Local Joint is connected to a gas station and while the decor is diner-like and nice and the restaurant clean it still is an odd location which could cause low expectations.  Don't let that be the case! Loved our trip here and the location makes the awesome breakfast food that much better and unexpected. It was a great breakfast for us out-of-towners who stayed in Fairview while visiting Asheville, NC. If you are in Asheville, this restaurant is only 15-20 minutes outside of the downtown area and worth the trip.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive with multiple fresh, hot coffee refills while we checked out the menu. The wife enjoyed \"The Fairview\" benedict that is topped with avocado and sauteed spinach. Not your typical diner fare for sure! She loved it.  I got 1 pancake (awesome maple flavored butter), side of homefries, and a cheese and egg biscuit.  The homefries were ridiculous. They were crispy fried potato cubes and they were heavenly. Not sure how a restaurant makes such an ordinary menu item stand out so much, but this place accomplished that. The pancake was great too, wish I had room for more than one. Now the biscuit was just a tad fluffy for my tastes but it was homemade and fresh which was nice.  All in all a great place. We went here on a whim one morning, one of the few vacation restaurants we didn't plan out in advance and it turned out to be one of the meal highlights of our trip. Wish we would have made it back for dinner!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of local but I've eaten here several times and it wasn't great.  Good, not great. Last time the server seemed annoyed we were eating there and haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Don't know why it's not five stars. Great food, and service. Haven't had a bad meal/time there yet"}
{"text":"Cool little spot outside of Asheville proper with outdoor seating.  They serve a delicious breakfast/brunch and has an eclectic menu but full of the basic yumminess, too. I had the eggs benedict and it was great.  The eggs were poached perfectly and the home fries were crispy and seasoned well.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Neat place attached to a gas station. Diner style dining with the open kitchen in the middle and a surrounding bar, similar to a Waffle House. Not able to sit together as a larger group as the tables are not movable. Ordered the big bear biscuit. Took longer than expected for food to arrive (about 20 min after we ordered). My biscuit was good. I felt the gravy needed seasoning. The home fries did not arrive hot and were rather starchy. A solid breakfast place, but IMO does not live up to the rave reviews by other yelpers."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by the locals. And they were right! Amazing breakfast and moderately priced. Can't wait to come by to check out their dinner specials. Will return very soon."}
{"text":"I was pretty underwhelmed by The local Joint. I ordered the Fairview Eggs with potatoes. The potatoes were extremely bland. Pepper, hot sauce, and ketchup could barely help these potatoes become edible. The eggs were slightly above average but not impressive enough to order again. Overall the service was cool, but nothing to rave about. With all of the amazing breakfast places to eat in Asheville, this is not a place I'd recommend. The server was kind and professional though."}
{"text":"It is attached to a gas station. The food was unappetizing and bland. My toast was burnt and rather than make another piece of toast the kitchen assumed if they put it burnt side down I wouldn't notice. Do yourself a favor and grab a bag of chips at the gas station to which it is attached and save your $10."}
{"text":"The portions were huge and the food was pretty tasty, it's a local joint like it's name says, and attached to a gas station, but don't let that deter you. The prices are excellent and it's definitely a great place to get breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a local eating spot for me, only 5 minutes from my house. However, I have noticed recently there are some waitresses who like to stick to their pride rather than helping the customer get the right meal. I am also disappointed in the limited items on the menu that seem to be constantly changing. Amidst all the concerns I have for the restaurant, the food quality is still great and the breakfast options are amazing! GF and Vegetarian options available but limited."}
{"text":"This small but awesome restaurant uses local food.  The breakfast and lunch menu's are outstanding.  I regularly eat the omelet called the local, it is always cooked to perfection, the grits that come as a side are also good.  It is a lot of food but so good.  I have had the reuben sandwich for lunch with home made potato chips. Great flavor, loved them both.  Service is always quick and friendly.  We love to eat here and go frequently.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot. Great burgers, innovative specials, and great service! Very fast and tasty! Don't let it being connected to a gas station fool you, those are some of the best diners. Not to mention it reminded me I needed air in my tires! ;)"}
{"text":"Eggplant fries are good app for a change. Food is good but could be more consistent. Always a good atmosphere. Great place to hangout. Eat Local!"}
{"text":"Left Asheville heading back to the resort and wanted a burger type meal but didn't want something I could get back home. This was way better than expected. Food was excellent and service was friendly from the time we walked in to the time we left. If you're in the area and want some great food, try this place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great little 'find' off the beaten path in Fairview, NC!  Lucky for those who live nearby. It's got kind of a metro-urbane vibe for a place attached to a gas station.  Only a brief wait on a Sunday at Noon, but totally worth it. My first time here & I chose lunch instead of breakfast, although a crab-cake & grits special sounded great, with a jalapeno, cilantro & cucumber cream sauce drizzled on top...yum!  Instead I had the Local Burger with caramelized bacon, blue cheese & garlic aoli. Everything was of good quality: nice sized local-meat patty, nicely toasted bun, tasty aioli served with house-made sweet pickle chips  and house-made potato chips.  The house-made potato chips were great, and I'm not usually a fan.  Also important: strong, clear brewed iced tea.  Hooray!  My friend got a version of eggs Benedict & declared it fabulous.  Her dish came with home fries and although they don't look special they were crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside with a nice garlicky punch.  They serve locally roasted coffee, which was also a hit. Lastly, the carrot cake was to die for!  Very moist, no coconut in it but lots of carrots & pecans and a delish cream cheese icing.  I'm a foodie & I couldn't quite place how it was made so moist and with apparently so little flour.  $5 a slice but worth every penny, just like  waitress said!  I will definitely be back to check out the breakfast & to try some of the specials.  I like the early hours too, open at 7AM even on Sundays."}
{"text":"This is a place you don't want to pass by. The Local Joint is a perfectly named dinner attached to a gas station where they source local ingredients, served up in all your favorite cuisine styles deliciously. If you have ever been worried about eating at a place adjacent to a gas station his place will change your mind right away. From the goat cheese local favorite omelette, to the to die for shrimp and grits and my all time favorite there, the home made potato chips smothered in crumbles of blue chews and a generous portion of blue cheese melty sauce.   It's everything you want from a traditional diner with the open kitchen, counter seating, and comfy booths plus a modern twist, better food, and beer and wine also. Who doesn't love a mimosa with their brunch.   The service is great and the staff will always make sure you're satisfied. The past time we went we had Natalie as our server and she was amazing.   There is nothing quite like this place around here. Their Cuban, Cajun, down-home style will keep you coming back for more again and again. And you can blame me if you get addicted to the blue cheese chips because I know I did."}
{"text":"Been going here for a couple months now. Mostly for breakfast.  Which is excellent.  Having lunch right now. Great food. Friendly wait staff. Fair prices. And the menu has a few items you just don't get elsewhere.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"this dish was called the Fungi and man I want another one all it needed was a few dashed of the habanero hot sauce. the home fries were nice and crispy the poached eggs cooked perfectly for my taste, the basil citrus sauce tied it all together with the wild mushrooms! Luckily I already had my coffee and was able to enjoy a fresh local Pisgah Brewing Pale Ale with this wonderful meal.    This place is called the local joint in Fairview, NC.  https://www.facebook.com/.../The-Local-Joint/175520499207682"}
{"text":"So this place was a very cute, eat local diner. The service was great and the food was great but our experience was quickly ruined. My girlfriends and I grabbed breakfast before leaving our weekend trip. My friend ordered a bacon egg and cheese biscuit. When it came out there was a long hair on the egg... Kinda gross so we sent it back. They were apologetic and She got a new biscuit within 2 minutes. She wanted to double check that there wasn't any hair in the new biscuit and there was the longest piece of hair cooked into the egg. We knew this wasn't the same biscuit from before because they showed us where the last biscuit was so they had to make her a THIRD biscuit. Just a heads up, the cooks have long beards and don't wear hair nets so check your food before you take a bite!"}
{"text":"I can hardly believe how remiss I have been, ones here at least ten times, without giving my perspective on the Local Joint. They put the LOCAL in \"local.\" It IS local, in so many ways. And that's good, because local is generally fresher, and the farmers care more about their local reputation. When their neighbor eats their produce, they know the word will get out. The food & beverage is sourced locally, as much as possible. Local beers, veggies, and meats are featured attractions here, but even the shrimp come from North Carolina waters. And they proudly list their local vendors on the chalk board, along with the specials. Speaking of shrimp. their shrimp & grits is better than the Sunset Terrace at the Grove Park, or anything I've had in the low country. The creamy sauce/gravy is light, but plenty delectable, perfectly cooked good size shrimp that would not embarrass a New Orleans seafood restaurant, and slice of Fried Green Tomato make this dish simply out of this world. The price is only $17 for such a delight. Other signature dishes we tried are great, too, and the burgers and Reuben are juicy, with the right amount of quality ingredients. The \"Joint Next Door\" is a lounge on the other side of the Eblen Quick Stop, owned by the same people, featuring live music, with food supplied by the Local Joint, of course. One night, the musicians stopped over at the Local Joint, and serenaded us in an impromptu concert, quite fun! Don't take my word for it, other Yelpers praise the Local Joint, and it got the Blue Ribbon Prize for \"Best Overall\" food at the final Bele Chere festival in 2013. My only warning, don't sit at the booths close to the convenience store entrance, because the doors will open, and the rest rooms are just beyond those doors, So if antiseptic odors interfere with your dining... Is Fairview too far? It all depends on your perspective. People from big cities think nothing of driving 30+ minutes for a great dining experience, whereas Ashvilleians tend to avoid crossing the French Broad River, if they can. For a change, you might want to dine \"out.\" Out of town, at the Local Joint."}
{"text":"So I have eaten here from Huddle house  to the second Huddle House to the Sugar Beet! Today was my chance to try The Local Joint, and am I glad I did! Casual great food. Excellent choices with a upscale flair! good to know also Breakfast served until 3 pm!!! that will make help on those weekends when you do not want to rise up early to sit in the crowds for B Fast! I will be here for breakfast real soon.Had excellent service and food today!"}
