{"text":"I'm back at Soju and once again and they didn't disappoint!  The Chef owner and the staff have created a place where the food, the drinks and the atmosphere are truly incredible!  The restaurant was packed but the hostess went out of her way to find us comfortable seats and get us settled! It was a busy night but our server made us feel as though we were the only customers!  And the food... for those lucky enough to have traveled to Korea, you won't be disappointed!  Every thing is made from scratch from what is obviously the freshest available!  This young Chef and his crew are rockstars!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past month and enjoyed both of my visits. The food isn't authentic and is admittedly a little expensive for what you get, but I love the ambience and the unique soju cocktails. It's exactly what you would expect from a Korean restaurant in the rapidly-gentrifying East End. For my second visit, I even brought my Korean mom here and we had a fun night drinking soju and eating the kimchi pajeon and nori fries. This isn't where I would go when I miss my mom's cooking (for that, I hit up Korea Garden in Oakland) but I would come back here for a date night with my husband."}
{"text":"Get here while you can(not). Soju won't last 6 months.  I had the Bulgogi and my girlfriend had the Salmon.  Neither had any taste and mine was under cooked.   The chef came to the table and didn't even introduce himself.  It was odd and uncomfortable.    This is a typical Pittsburgh restaurant; wrong music, waitstaff wearing sports shirts and the food is below average.    Soju wouldn't last 1 week in a big city."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Soju is now one of my favorite restaurants. The pork dumplings are a must. The atmosphere is perfect along with a great selection of drinks. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! We sampled most of the appetizers and we got the bbq ribs. Everything was beyond expectations! The drinks were amazing, and the staff was so friendly and helpful! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I started off with the pork dumplings & the poke ahi tuna marinated in spicy mayo. Both amazing! As our entrees I had the bibimbap & he had the bbq chicken! Again both absolutely amazing. Best bibimbap in Pittsburgh! They also have speciality cocktails and numerous craft beers!! HIGHLY recommend! We will be back again :)"}
{"text":"Soju is a new and upcoming Korean restaurant in Bloomfield that is highly overrated. Me and my group of friends were craving authentic and well-made Korean food and we saw this place open up and decided to go.  The first impressions of this store were promising - the decor was contemporary and waitresses friendly. However, we were given A4 paper menus with a limited selection of choices. I ordered the bibimbap for 18 dollars (it was 14 dollars + 4 dollars for beef which I thought was absurd and reflects a poor pricing strategy). The food itself was pretty good, I would argue a little too sweet but given the target audience it makes sense, but absolutely not worth the price of nearly 20 dollars. The bibimbap also comes with no side dishes, a necessary practice in Korean cuisine.  TLDR: service and ambience is good, food is decent, but definitely not worth the price. Would not come again."}
{"text":"Soju is a great new restaurant in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Garfield.   We had the Kalbi and the Bulgogi for our entrees and the Gimbap for the appetizer.   All the food was great and the Serb was wonderful.   We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC homemade Korean food!    I am Korean and have been to South Korea many times to visit my family.   The food reminds me of my childhood because it tastes like the food my mom makes at home.  I overheard the owner say that he uses his grandmother's recipes.   I think that this is my favorite Korean restaurant in pgh. The kalbi is addicting and delicious!   Also tried the kimchijeon, chicken katsu, and bibimbap. All delicious.  I can't say enough good things about this place!!"}
{"text":"Dinner at Soju last night with friends. Friend 1 really enjoyed her Soju, Asian Pear, Lemon, Ginger, Soda cocktail, calling it refreshing, perfect for a summer's day.  I had the Bulleit Bourbon, Bulleit Rye, Plum, Honey, Basil cocktail, served up in a coupe glass, very tasty!  Other 2 friends enjoyed some beers. Pork Mandu app was very tasty! But somehow our dinner order got lost, so there was a delay, but the waitress made up for it with a round of drinks on the house, very nice. 3 of us got the Korean BBQ Combo, a mix of Kalbi, Bulgogi, and Dwaejibulgogi. I was tempted by the Octopus Poke, but the smell of the grilled meat platter from our neighbors was too intoxicating not to try! I'm not a big kimchi fan, but their version is not too bad, and along with the pickled cucumbers come with the dish (banchan) as traditional, so I did eat it and wonderfully complimented the meat and rice.  Friend 2 got the Tuna Poke and declared it delish. The chef came out & said hello to check on us, & we all agreed the dinners were a success. He said the Octopus Poke is not a big seller so they may discontinue it, so i'll have to get back soon to try it.  Other than the delay/snafu, the only drawbacks were the room was kind of cold ( it was a cool evening but the air was on full blast ) , and the music was kind of loud. The waitress even asked us to repeat our drink & food selections as it was so loud. And loud from the crowd chatter too, as it was busy, so maybe turn the music down & add some sound dampening devices, (or even some art?!) on the walls... But all in all a welcome addition to our neighborhood, we'll be back !"}
{"text":"Having been to this delightful restaurant twice, I can whole heartedly say that Soju is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh  The service has been very welcoming, yet professional.  Since Soju's popularity has rocketed, finding a table is easier earlier in the evening.  Favorite dishes so far include the octopus poke with spicy mayo and japchae (translucent sweet potato noodles with veggies).  The bulgogi (Korean BBQ beef) is a must-try.  The soju cocktail with watermelon is delicious as well.  During my next visit, I may try one of the chicken offerings.  They look scrumptious."}
{"text":"Watermelon Soju all the way, we also got the pork dumplings that came with the best dipping sauce. I got the bibimbap and my boyfriend got the kalbi. Both were so good. We will definitely be regulars here."}
{"text":"Great food! Super slow service! Be aware of the long wait  When you come in, you can seat yourself and do not waste time waiting for a host. When we came in around 7pm, they weren't busy so they told us we can sit wherever we want. But during our time at the restaurant, it got filled pretty quick and people were coming in, we saw them waiting to be seated for a long time before the waitress get a chance to stopover and tell them seat themselves at the bar or any table.  We were really happy with the food but not the service. Our appetizer came out very fast but it took a very long time for the entry.  Ordered Chicken kasu, it is fried chicken with house bbq sauce. 10/10 crispy batter and well seasoned chicken. Madu, we got the pork ones. I would say they are 7.5/10. It is essentially fried dumplings. The dipping sauce is sour and spicy/sweet, but the filling were a little bit dry. For entry, we got BBQ combo, 8.5/10, it came with 3 kinds of bbq, kabi ribs, bogogi and grilled pork. I like the beef better than the pork. The pork turned out a little dry but the beef were very juicy, tender and flavorful. Also the BBQ combo comes with two small side plates, it includes kimchi, radish and pickled cucumber.   As I was saying the slow service, we waited long time to get it, even people came in after us ordered the same thing and had their entry for a while and we were still waiting. After we finished our meal, we waited long time for the check, even we try get eye contact so that our waitress would notice that we are ready for a check. Not very effective. Eventually, we were able to get her attention by waving.   I'm not sure if I would come back to do a sit down dinner anymore. We had to wait too long for a Tuesday night, I can't imagine any other days that could be less of a wait. Maybe takeout next time?"}
{"text":"My wife and I came during the first week open for dinner. We had some tasty Korean Mandu dumplings which were pan fried to a delicious crispiness. We don't usually eat much Korean food so we weren't familiar with the entrees. Our friends recommended the Salmon teriyaki which was cooked perfectly with a sweet teriyaki sauce that complemented the sticky rice nicely. I like noodles so I got Japchae sweet potato noodles with beef. I loved the smooth texture of the noodles, similar to rice noodles, and the tenderly cook beef pieces. Portion sizes are appropriate not too much or little. Ambiance was very relaxing, will be even better in the summer time with their front glass wall opened to the sidewalk. We'll be coming back more for sure this summer."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and drinks! Totally authentic korean food in a nice modern atmosphere. The kalbi is some of the best in town. They have a bunch of different liquors for cocktails to choose from (like cachaca and soju). I'm Happy Pittsburgh has this great new korean restaurant!"}
{"text":"I think it's interesting that people who say that this restaurant doesn't  serve authentic Korean food are clearly not Korean themselves as I am. This Korean dishes served here come  pretty close to the food my mom, who immigrated from South Korea, makes. I enjoyed the kimbap, mandu, kimchi fried rice, and bulgogi.  I have also had the chicken katsu which I know is not Korean(it doesn't take a genius to know that) and it was excellent, tender inside and crispy outside. I thought the decor was nice and pleasant but honestly, who cares about how a place looks as long as it is clean and if the food is good.  I've been here a few times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"We came in fairly late on Saturday because they don't take reservations. It worked well as we were able to find a spot for 6 opening. We made our way in and reviewed the drink list. I chose the sangria, a fair option with a hint too much ice. Hubs and several others at the table got Soju, Maggie's Farm White Rum, Mango, Pineapple, Pomegranate, Ginger, Yakuroto Yogurt, Chillsung Soda. It was good, but very sweet.  The group ordered the pancake to start. It was good, but lacked some of the crispiness and flavor that I was hoping for. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good for where we are.   Hubs ordered the combo plate. The pork and beef were quite tasty, the chicken was so so.... I had the bibimbap without meat since hubs had so much meat (we had enough for leftovers). It worked and balanced well in terms of food. The egg in the bibimbap was over hard, which is my main complaint. Delicious nonetheless.   I capped out the evening with the Soju, Asian Pear, Lemon, Ginger, Soda. It was refreshing for the warm evening, but sweet. Seems like the thing here.  Good addition to the area and reasonably priced. I can see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious meal and a fun atmosphere.   We wandered in on a Friday night.  No reservations given here, but we were able to snag a seat at the bar.   All of the bartenders were friendly and prompt.    We started with the pancake and the gimbap.  Both were delicious - flavorful and filling.  I also had a soju cocktail, which was bright and refreshing.  Then onto the entrées.  I chose the poke and asked them to do half of each style.  The shoyu style was far superior for my tastes, but I appreciated that I was able to try both.  It was a healthy portion and I was barely able to finish it after the appetizers.  My boyfriend got the Bibimbap, which was also a winner.  Again, the dish was sizable and the beef was dressed really nicely.     At the end of the meal, the bartender offered up a shot of soju, which was a nice touch.  Lots of tattoos and piercings and such on most of the staff, so this might not be the place for your prim and proper grandma; but I liked it a lot.  It's a trendy, but comfy space and I'll be sure to return."}
{"text":"Awesome Korean fusion joint in Pittsburgh. From the food, to the drinks, to the atmosphere, everything is amazing. And you can't beat the price. I highly recommend anyone try this place out."}
{"text":"Soju can be added to the list of disappointing new restaurants.  From the name to the decor, you'd hope they are being innovative but one visit was enough to see why they're not.  The restaurant screams hipsters with plants and wooden decor.  Every new Pittsburgh restaurant is jumping on the hipster decor wagon.  Honestly, people return for good food.  Focus on food!  On the menu, you've got korean food and poke.  I was tempted to try their poke but was told it looked bare minimum BASIC.  Don't bother getting poke here, go to poke specialty spots.  The presentation and ingredients looked sad.  My table ordered the seafood pancake to share.  It's extremely starchy because it wasn't cooked long enough.  For entree, we ordered an array of items from bibimbop to bulgogi.  They don't taste authentic.  People may say \"oh but they are not going for authentic korean food!\".  Then tell me, what is innovative about it?  Because the food here tasted like subpar korean food selling at higher price.  For a place called Soju, it's not overflowing with soju either.  Sadly, soju serves basic korean food that can be easily made at home at a high price and low quality."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, and the service is very nice and friendly.  The interior decoration of the place is also great and makes the place very welcoming, nice big open window in front as well to enjoy summer evenings. My only negative point is that the prices are rather on the high side and could be a little bit more reasonable for the food you get.   For vegetarian fellows, they do have a good set of options which I particularly appreciated, as long as you would be ok with eating eggs."}
{"text":"This is a pretty new place. The dining environment is really nice. They also have a wet bar. The food is so so, very Americanized mixed Asian food. We tried six different dishes. The curry and short beef ribs are pretty good. The rice bowel and spicy kimchi tofu soup is not good. They are not even close to what Korean food like.  In general, 5 stars for environment and services. 2.5 stars for food taste."}
{"text":"I am no expert on Korean food, but Soju was delicious. Whether or not it is authentic, it was very tasty. I got the Gimbap appetizer and the Bimbimbap as an entree. I also had two cocktails. The prices were a little high but the food and the drinks really good. The restaurant is small, which is nice if the restaurant is not busy. Luckily, for us, it was not."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, and an excellent vibe! I really enjoyed the gimbap and tuna poke! I plan to make this my new regular spot, the staff is super friendly, parking is super easy, and the food is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Soju was good. I didn't have the highest expectations going in, but I was pleasantly surprised. The space inside is small, but the atmosphere is great. Although it's a Korean restaurant and they have some Korean dishes (ie: kimbap, bulgogi), it's more Korean American/fusion since there's poké and other Japanese inspired dishes like chicken katsu and curry.   I shared the kimbap, which is like a Korean Sushi, and it was great. We also had nori fries which weren't anything too special. For my entree, I had the spicy pork tenderloin dish which came with banchan (side dishes) in one bowl. Although the plates looked small, the portions were pretty big.  I will be back to try out other dishes and some soju drinks!"}
{"text":"In town for business from Minnesota, saw it was hot and new.  Food was was awesome, brought me right back to when I was there.  Staff and Owner super nice. Best wishes   Must go"}
{"text":"I came here thinking it was really good, because it had a 5 star average and it just opened up. However, I was pretty disappointed. This was among the worst Korean food I've had, especially for the price. I ordered the bulgogi, and for the price of $18, it was definitely not what I expected. First of all, the bulgogi was not cut properly. It was more of a steak (?) and the portion was small. It came with some side dishes, but they were in a small bowl, which is unlike what I've had in other Korean restaurants.  The flavor of the bulgogi was extremely sweet, but alright. It didn't taste super Korean, but I could see the appeal. It wasn't exactly \"bad\" - just not good. I would definitely not come here if you're looking for an authentic Korean experience, and if you like fusion food, I guess this is closer to that. However, flavor could be improved, and prices could be lowered, or portion size increased. One good thing though was that the service was friendly, and food didn't take long to get there."}
{"text":"I Can't say enough good things about this place... the fried tofu was amazing!!! The bbq combination was one of the best dishes I've ever had.. and the kimchi fried rice was insanely good! Awesome staff and the chef is cool as hell! Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Newly opened, this restaurant/bar is a Korean fusion culinary delight! The restaurant was filled with warm ambiance, tastefully decorated, and very clean. The staff was attentive and helpful.  There was a wide choice of delectable dishes from which to choose.  Hubby and I shared the mangu (steamed pork dumplings with a nice texture and a flavorful dipping sauce), as a starter.  Hubby had the teriyaki salmon, moist and flaky, with an awesome pineapple glaze, served with rice.  I had the chicken katsu, (panko breaded fried chicken), crunchy and moist, with rice. The sweet accompanying sauce was delish! There was also an assortment of craft beers and speciality drinks available. This place is a hidden gem and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Asian restaurant in town! The atmosphere was trendy and fun. I love Korean food and Soju offered some of my favorite dishes.  I had the tuna poke, japchae, and gimbap. The food was great, as well as the portions. The watermelon Soju  drink perfection. The service was quick and attentive.  I definitely recommend Soju. A great new restaurant to add to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This place is honestly the one of the worst korean places that I've been to. I was extremely excited when I went due to the high rating but upon getting there I was very disappointed with the food and menu.  To start, despite being named \"soju\", they only offer 1 soju bottle (unflavored), the rest being \"soju cocktails\". Additionally, the food was extremely overpriced and completely unauthentic. The food we ordered was not similar to typical korean fare. At best this would be considered american-style korean food. It was very understaffed, with only 2 waitresses handling the entire room and the bar.  The decor inside was pleasing, however I give the food a one-star and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I happened upon this listing when seeing what restaurants were open near me at like 9:15pm, and was excited to find a new restaurant had just opened up!  The menu is a bit limited, but covers a lot of the basics. I was dining by myself, so I didn't get to try the Kimchijeon, which was still enticing. It has a couple vegetarian main options (japchae and bibimbap), and they were happy to add tofu for $1. The bibimbap was pretty tasty, though I was disappointed that it wasn't served in a hot stone bowl - which is something I really love. So, I didn't get to cook the egg yolk with the rice, stir it all around with a spoon (uh, there were no spoons at the table?) and eat it with a spoon (which, my understanding, is the traditional utensil for this dish).   Sadly, unlike most Korean restaurants I've been to, the main didn't come accompanied with a selection of tiny banchan side dish appetizers which I usually really love.  I had decided it was a non-drinking day already, so I didn't get try any of their interesting Soju cocktails or very enticing craft beers on draft!  Traditional Korean - this place is not. It definitely has the Brooklyn hipster industrial bar-restaurant metal+wood+edison bulb atmosphere going on. It was pretty quiet when I was there. I don't think I saw a single Korean person working there - though I didn't go to the kitchen.  Overall, the food I did order tasted good. It's a bit expensive for what you get, though, and not as good as, say, Nak Won Garden. But, hey, they have a full bar and are nicely located on Penn Ave."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Did I feel like I was in Seoul?  Not really - too many people speaking English, not enough people glued to their phones, and women didn't all have one of five haircuts/hair colors.  Did I feel like I was in Koreatown in Manhattan?  Not really - way too many sober people.  Did I feel like I was in Flushing, Queens?  Could've been!  I liked the food, may not be the most authentic Korean food I ever had but when I ate it my taste buds were like, \"mmm more please.\"  Prompt and very friendly service.  Nice ambience.  A little expensive, though I did have plenty of leftovers.  Banchan should come with every meal, and not just a few, but that's a minor quibble.  I will come back."}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in Pittsburgh. Been twice in two weeks. The pork mandu is a quick delightful app With the homemade sauce topping it off. Gimbap for all sushi lovers is something like I've never had before. Excellent. I got chicken Katsu both times because it was good the first time but there are a lot of unique dishes that all look tasty. The homemade cheesecake was light and airy with great taste.   Can't wait to go back to the friendly atmosphere and enjoy some of the hand crafted cocktails."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the food! Everything we ordered was delicious, the sauce on the fried tofu is perfect and the Kimchi fried rice was heavenly. The beer and drink selection was much more robust than I expected as well! The air conditioning was cranked so I recommend taking a sweater in with you though."}
