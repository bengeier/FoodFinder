{"text":"My wife and I just ate dinner here and I was pleasantly suprised. The dining area is nothing special but it's in a strip mall so we weren't expecting much. A few cafeteria type tables bit the place was clean. My wife had the chile rellano and I had the enchiladas  (plates). Hers was good but a little bland. Mine was fantastic. I ordered the beef and the tortilla was good as well as being stuffed with peppers and onions. We paid $16 for both so the price was excellent. I would have given it 5 stars except the bland rellano. We will be back. Nice and cheap."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good... prices are reasonable and portions match what you're paying for. I also like being able to watch them cook my food. New establishment they're having their grand opening... so if you're in the area of Chandler and Kyrene you should go check them out. The staff is nice and friendly, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Friendly, fast service...great food for a good price!  It's hard to find a good breakfast burrito...gonna miss this place when we move!"}
{"text":"So I was a little skeptical about the place when we decide to go in. I'm so glad I went in! I had the Carne Asada Torta and it was great. I prefer the authentic Mexican places and this one hit the spot. They have a good salsa bar so you can pick from several salsas. The price is very reasonable. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my machaca burrito for lunch. I ended up sharing it with my friend because the portion size was too big for one person. I loved the condiment bar, the spicy carrots were perfect. Everyone in the group enjoyed their food and would come back."}
{"text":"Food was flavorful, but the portions are too small to justify the price on the burritos and plates. My burro had about 6 or 7 layers of tortilla before I reached the carne asada and overall there was very little meat in it. Not really what I'm looking for in a $7 burro. There are too many places around that have much bigger portions and are just as tasty. The difference between me giving a 2 star and a 3 star is for the good salsa bar - much better than most of the already packaged salsitas you get at many other places."}
{"text":"Not a fancy place. It has tables and chairs for eating in, not lots of decor. The food is great and inexpensive. You step up to the counter and order your food. I've been there several times now. There is a salsa bar with three salsas, cucumbers, radishes and other fresh pickled vegetables.  I've had the Carne Asada burrito, California burrito, Carne Carne Asada tacos, chicken tacos and a Chimichanga plate. The plate comes with rice and beans, which I don't usually like, but their rice and beans were much better than average and I ate them all.  All the entrees have large amount of steak and chicken, guacamole and pico de gallo. The tacos are made with two soft corn tacos.  Recently I ordered four tacos for my wife and I. My wife could only eat one and I couldn't finish my second one because they were so full of good food. I highly recommend this place. I gave it five starts because it's not pretentious and serves great food at a great price."}
{"text":"Very good food and a clean place i will go back soon love it! Sp m any choices of food."}
{"text":"No complaints here!  We called in our order for pick up and it was ready as promised in 10 minutes.  Everyone there is very nice and friendly.  The food is amazing but you have to like spicy!  I got the huevos rancheros and my husband got the chorizo and egg burrito both were amazing and had a great kick to them. Can't beat the price either, 2 big portions and total bill was only $11.50.  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Good taco place. I especially like coming here for taco Tuesday where you can get 5 shredded beef or chicken tacos for 6 bucks. Not a bad deal. The place is clean and the prices are the norm for fast food mexican places."}
{"text":"I had the Machaca Burro.  Kids had the bean burro. Very tasty and good size. Friendly service. Love the fire sauce."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast burrito, the tortilla was burned. I couldn't eat it and had the worst taste in my mouth. I don't know how you mess up something so simple. Surprised at these other reviews"}
{"text":"Great place! I had the Carne Asada burrito and it was really good! Staff are all really friendly.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Well after seeing several good reviews on here I gave them a try. I had the beef chimi, and it was different. They put big slices of cheese, tomato, onions, and bell peppers in the chimi. This makes them look much bigger than you expect. I have eaten Mexican all over the country, and I've never had anything like this, and I  have to say it just didn't trip my trigger. Not much seasoning, and the green and red sauce was not that great. 

I also got a green chili burrito for later, and it was horrible! They used the same shredded beef that was in my beef chimi, and added a small amount of the green tomatilo sauce, and a bunch of rice. There was no green chili in it at all.  The service was friendly and quick, but I was the only one there. The people who wrote good reviews about this place don't have a clue what good Mexican food is!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to writing this review, I'm certainly overdue with this one. Great place for cheap but tasty Mexican food. I usually have their carne asada options from their menu, be it the plate, the tacos or the burrito. Their portions are large, and the food is fresh. They also have a decent sauce bar for some basic selection of mild, medium and hot sauces. The service is prompt, however seating is pretty limited, so most people like to opt for the take-out option. I've always left this place with a stuffed tummy, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes Mexican food."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim because it's not in my neighborhood. I ordered the combo platter of two chile rellanos.  The order came with rice and beans topped with sour cream. I have to say this was one of the best small shopping center Mexican places that I've been too in a LONG time! I was very pleased with the taste of the food. It was sooooo good and so authentic. Now I only wish I was closer but I will for sure make my way over there when I start craving something authentic and tasty. Place was clean, service was friendly and fast.  Food came out fast and hot. A+ Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos in Chandler and the place is kept clean! Under $5 and sometimes more than I can eat"}
{"text":"Went there upon a recommendation from a friend.  We grew up in New Mexico and are very familiar with great burritos.  On the first visit, I ordered the Chili Rellano burrito.  Huge, a lot of food for the money.  However, the amount of onions was so overpowering, that's all I could taste.  Awful since I don't like onions, period.  Went back a few days later, placed the same order, requested no onions.  Got home, another onion burrito.  It's as if onion was the primary ingredient..awful! One last try last night. Ordered a burrito, please, no onions.  Again, FULL OF ONIONS!!!  Done with this place.  Can't get the simplest of requests right and honestly, the taste is extremely bland. Three stars since the taco was decent."}
{"text":"I usuall hit this spot 2 times a week.  They keep the restaurant very clean.  Great food.  Great prices.  Nice service.  Try them out!!"}
{"text":"Great mexican food! The burritos are always consistently delicious. Their mini tacos are awesome. I love the salsa bar, but beware of the hot red sauce... it really is hot!"}
{"text":"I ordered the two chicken taco plate.  Got a bone in the chicken.  The beans tasted like lemons and the rice tasted like soap.  Awful food."}
{"text":"Great food. Super fresh. I will definitely be back.
They made it, made to order. Ingredients are fresh and they have not been sitting around all day"}
{"text":"Cant beat it for \"fast\" mexican food. I got a carne asada burrito with pico de galllo and i requested extra Serrano peppers. Delish!"}
{"text":"Work right next door to this place absolutely love it. Reasonably priced and great food."}
{"text":"2nd visit. Lunch and I ordered the two taco combo plate.  With a drink they charged me $20! I corrected them but poor gal took 15 mins trying to figure out how to refund me the difference.  Meanwhile,  no one was making my food!  I'll give them one more chance."}
{"text":"Got the Chille Relleno Burrito, enchilada style  it was busy, but worth the wait, call in advance if you are in a rush for lunch."}
{"text":"I purchased a chimichanga de carne asada the meat looks like it has lightly cooked and the chimichanga it's send was super greasy not edible, I am the type of person that hates wasting food and I ended up have to throw this out. It tasted absolutely disgusting idk what happened if they changed cooks or what but the food has never been this bad."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for the first time after a coworker recommended it. I got a carnitas torta which was delicious. The bread was fresh and toasted and the guacamole was flavorful. After speaking to some of the regulars there, they said the al pastor tacos are incredible and these are only sold on Fridays but they are usually sold out around noon. I will be back to try it! Service was great. The location is small but everyone gets in and out quickly. All in all, great place with many regular customers."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. My husband had the super nachos and I had the cbimichanga. Large servings so the price is more than fair. Staff was super friendly"}
{"text":"Great food. You won't be disappointed. I ordered the enchiladas, one beef and one chicken. I would say it was the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast burritos. Definitely beats the other places around here. Nice environment inside and really friendly staff. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is great! It just opened up down the street from my house and I figured I would give it a try! The prices are reasonable with large portions. The people are friendly. Can't wait to try more items off the menu!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican Food.
Fresh Cooked to order. Restaurant is clean.
Carne Asada Taco was good. Asked if I wanted fresh quac & pico, \" of course\"!
Nice salsa bar with three different salsas: Mild (green), regular Hot & Fire ( not a lot of flavor just a lot of heat). Carrots are pickled and tasty and the also offer an onion relish.
Price are very reasonable. Will be back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"The food was fine but needed more zip or flavor. The carne asada seemed bland and the beans and salsa were also mild with no distinctive taste."}
{"text":"I've died and gone to burrito heaven! Best egg potato and cheese burrito in the valley hands down. This rating is coming from a Mexican so you know it's legit!"}
{"text":"I got off work 7 am since I work night shifts. I was craving mexican food and found this little gem on yelp.
It was a monday morning, I checked in on yelp and got a free medium drink which is a plus. Girl cashier greeted me with a hello. She told me they have a special on Monday's for tacos that are 99 cents. 
I said well hey that's awesome I ordered me 2 carne asada tacos. I didn't want to eat anything to heavy just something small to fill up my belly since I was too tired and needed to sleep from working late.
The tacos were mini almost similar to street tacos. They were perfect for the price. As I wait for the food which wasn't very long. It was 3 to 4 mins. 
The cashier made a conversation with me which I thought was nice of her. I wasn't bored just waiting for my food to be done. 
They have a salsa bar for you to get what type of salsa you want red, green, medium spicy, spicy, etc. Sodas are free refills. 
When I got home I ate the 2 mini tacos and man they were good. Glad I found this place. Will deff be back anytime I crave mexican! Awesome service btw and price matches on what you are getting."}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the service; friendly staff and clean restaurant. HOWEVER, food was terrible!! We got guacamole, chips, fish taco, carne asada tacos and fish burritos. We ended up only eating our chips and guac. Fish was dry fried tilapia, carne was undercooked with no seasoning, so disappointing and sad."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican food we've had in Arizona. The tacos are generous and the meat is very flavorful. The Chile Relleno is my go-to as it is my favorite and theirs is excellent! The breakfast burrito they advertise is huge and delicious. Lastly, their service is always friendly and prompt. It gets pretty busy at lunch but you will find it quiet at dinner time but still just as delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about their food."}
