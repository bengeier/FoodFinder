{"text":"First time here, very impressed with the decor and ambiance. Food and service was fantastic! Definitely would recommend this place. Prices are good for the food portions and service provided"}
{"text":"I would give this place a four but just considering the price of a bowl of pho it's just a bit too pricy."}
{"text":"Just in the area and feeling the need for noodles and viet iced coffee,  so I stopped in here. The decor and prices are \"upscale\" but the noodle bowl and coffee was standard fare. Not bad by any means, as far as taste goes, but certainly NOT worth $13 (bbq pork & spring roll noodle bowl). The viet iced coffee with milk was good but again, at $5 a bit too pricey for what it is. The other odd thing was that the noodle \"bowl\" came on a plate, sort of disassembled.  All the components were in their own little pile. I prefer my noodle bowl in a BOWL. Plated, it was hard to get bits of everything on my chop sticks. Not a bad meal, just too expensive for me."}
{"text":"Came out to try the dim sum and left very satisfied.  Fancy interior with a decently quiet atmosphere.  First dish was the BBQ pork rice crepes.  Was very disappointed as it was not flavourful and barely warm.  The rest of the food was served hot and quite delicious.  I would definitely come back because there are plenty of tables, ambient noise is low, plenty of parking and the food is good, though I may skip BBQ pork dishes."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary.  I go there frequently for business meetings and have always had attentive staff and great food quality.  They've renovated extensively and elevated the status of the modest strip mall considerably.  The place is quiet even when fairly full, which is a nice contrast to most of the dining establishments nearby in Crowfoot plaza, making it a great place to meet or just enjoy a relaxing dining experience."}
{"text":"Just moved to Calgary and was craving some Pho' . Just happened to see this place, walked in and was very pleased with the feel of the place. Fantastically decorated. My normal viet places are usually a few dollars cheaper but seeing it was my first in Calgary I wasn't too picky. Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Very elegant inside. The food was nicely done.    We shared dishes and everything was tasty. The brussel sprouts were the best ever! We were there for lunch and shared a couple of soups..both were good. The vietnamese burger (who knew) was very good...a bit spicy too. I would definitely go back next time im in Calgary."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary bar none. Can't believe we lived so close and never came here. The food, drinks and service are top notch.  The decor and atmosphere is great, very well lit and spacious. The tables are spaced to allow comfort, everything you would expect from a classy restaurant. We will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Food is great tasting, they several more than Vietnamese. We've been a few times and do enjoyed it. Also more classy/trendy interior than your typical Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is great with service to match. Restaurant is quiet which is a nice change. I  recommended this location."}
{"text":"The food was nicely done! Servers were friendly and good service. Very nice renovation for dim sum! Same here for dim sum yesterday and tried out dinner tonight! Really like it! Strong recommend *****"}
{"text":"Such a disappoitment.  Food was terrible!  Oriental Phoenix (58 Ave) is the only place in Calgary I will eat Vietnamese food and I estimate I've dined there at least 40 times in the 15 years (#23 is my fave) with not one complaint ever.  We treated our friends to dinner out last night.  The food was embarassingly bad and the prices disturbingly high for the quality and quantity.  The server was very green (her first night) but she was adorable so we didn't want to make it difficult for her.  Tipped her well.  Don't get the calamari.  It is more like a plate of greasy onion rings with a few tidbits of calamari thrown in.  The combo is served on a large plate, not a bowl and looked nasty.  Not the usual fresh delight it is at Oriental Phoenix.  The imperial rolls were overcooked and had minimal filling.  My lemon grass chicken was just blah and dry.  It served with some jasmine rice and about a cup of mixed salad out of box.  $15?  So uninspired...waste of money and will never be back."}
{"text":"Okay so big news about Phoenix Kitchen..... as of a few months ago, it became a CHINESE restaurant!  I can honestly say that I'm blown away by Phoenix Kitchen - it holds a niche spot that is hard to find in Calgary - an upscale contemporary Chinese restaurant that serves authentic, traditional Chinese cuisine.   It's in Sliver Springs which I consider deep in the burbs, and the unassuming exterior hides a contemporary, clean, and well lit restaurant space. The ambiance is perfect - the ceramics are modern, clean, and of good quality, and the space is clean, open, with tasteful contemporary decor (though design gurus will disagree with me when they see the interesting choice of light fixtures).  I have tried Phoenix Kitchen for both the regular dinner menu and the brunch dim sum menu. I can say overall that I am impressed with it. It's usually difficult to find a Chinese Restaurant that balances traditional flavours with modern expectations for ambiance, but this place does it well.  The Dim Sum has all your traditional fare, and I can say that the overall quality is pretty good. Price wise you are looking at a bit above average, $6-ish a plate, but the flavours were good and the traditional authenticity was kept.   The dinner menu, while fairly extensive, had it's fair share of authentic items. However, this is going to be another one of those cases where they are gonna give you a different chinese menu if they see you are appropriately ethnic - and that menu is where the jewels are! The waiter will also share the specials - make sure to ask for the chinese items."}
{"text":"Had the lemon grass chicken. It was amazing. The ambience is great ! I highly recommend this if your looking for good Vietnamese"}
{"text":"The decor in O Phoenix is a bit unusual. The restaurant sits in an unassuming strip mall, but inside it looks (and sounds, thanks to the space-agey music they play) like a trendy lounge. That's not good or bad, but it's an unusual contrast to a typical Vietnamese restaurant.  We came mid-afternoon on a quiet Monday, so we were surprised and disappointed that we had to wait for a half hour for our food to come. Once they arrived, our orders (shrimp rice wrappers, pho, and grilled pork on rice) were tasty enough, although the pho came without the basil leaves, bean sprouts, sriracha, and hoisin sauce that typically accompany it at other Vietnamese restaurants.  Overall this place was ok and I'd eat there again, but at the same time I can't think of any reason to recommend it over any other Vietnamese restaurant given the wait."}
{"text":"Review: dinner.  There's not a lot of authentic Chinese restaurants up in the nw and when this place opened we had to try it out.  Bottomline: great authentic Chinese food with clean, modern decor and fantastic service. Gem in the nw. Only anchored by the prices of food.  Atmosphere: by far the cleanest washroom in all of Chinese restaurants on Calgary. Chinese restaurant and clean washroom should not be in the same sentence. But it is here.That in itself should get an extra star. Decor is modern and eye pleasing. Service was phenomenal. We didn't want beef in the set menu and they were happy to substitute pork with no extra cost. Server was friendly and attentive.  Food: great authentic Chinese food. I'm originally from HK and this restaurant reflects the food from over there. Each dish was well portioned, well balanced, and tasty.  Value: this restaurant would deserve a 5 star if it wasn't for the price. The set menu wasn't overly expensive, but enough not to make it a regular outing for me."}
{"text":"Been to Phoenix Kitchen a few times now.  Modern d√©cor with interesting lamps.  I like the design of the restaurant.  A smiling Buddha greets you at the front door!  Customer service is very polite and prompt.  There are wait staff I recognize from other Chinese restaurants I've frequented.  The dim sum is excellent especially the shrimp rice roll crepes!  It's a big portion, too!  Love the dim sum items here like siu mai, har gow, xiu long bau, pan fried taro cake, pan fried turnip cake, deep-fried capelin with the roe, all so yummy!    Wish they could have some sweets.  The egg tart is on the dim sum menu but somehow, they never have it ready.  The congee needs some work.  Dim sum line-ups are very long during busy times.    Also, had their authentic Chinese dinners here at Phoenix Kitchen, as advertised in the Chinese newspaper.  All are quite delicious and quite reasonably priced, especially the dinner for 2."}
