{"text":"There is only one reason to go here.  Okay, maybe two.  Great hot pizza and good cold beer.  The service is hit or miss and the ambiance is, well, typical local bar style. We've been here a dozen times and things really don't change despite the \"new ownership.\"  But, hey, you can get a good pizza, a couple of beers, maybe play some trivia or watch a game on the many TVs. Or, if you are really lucky, you can catch karaoke night....frightful, but entertaining nonetheless!"}
{"text":"This is NOT a place to go eat.  The food quality is very inconsistent as is the food preparation.   This even applies to the pizza."}
{"text":"What had potential has fallen like a rock to the bottom of Lake Erie. A change in the kitchen staff a year ago was a godsend, but they have since bailed, and so has the food quality. Pizza is still good, but that's about it. Everything else from the kitchen is either frozen and reheated, or from GFS. Had the Lenten Perch, it was tasteless. The broasted chicken is good, so I'm sure it will be off the menu by the time you read this.   The wait staff is slow and totally inattentive. They will bring you what you ask for, but at times I feel like a signal officer on an aircraft carrier trying to land a drink.   And don't ever expect something for nothing.  The fine art of comping drinks has yet to find its way to SE Strongsville. And, keep your eye on the drink prices. They change more often than I change my underwear!  Glad to hear the outta towner below was favorably impressed. Cleveland rocks!"}
{"text":"Friendly! I'm from out of town and stopped in for a beer. I don't know anyone.  The owner comes up to me and offers me some free pizza with two more in the oven?   I miss the Ohio hospitality and this place is the perfect example of it.   So good..."}
{"text":"will never go back. ordered the special burger and fries for 5.99, bartender asked if we wanted cheese, my husband said yes, when the bill came they charged 8.99, when I asked the bartender she said the cheese made it a SPECIALTY burger, THREE DOLLARS FOR A PIECE OF CHEESE, REALLY!!!. Horrible atmospere, they made us feel like we were intruding on their private neighborhood bar instead of making us feel welcome, too bad because we are locals looking for a new place to go and grab a burger and  beer. I don't predict they will be there long."}
{"text":"Stopped at the frog for some food walked in the door it had to be 90 degrees in the place we turned around and walked out, we keep trying the place but it never changes. Nobody wants to sweat while they eat"}
