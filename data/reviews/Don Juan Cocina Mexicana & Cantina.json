{"text":"We had lunch carry out today and the food was great, the service was fantastic and I look forward to dining in soon. The chips and salsa are my favorite in town so far, and I am a total chip snob!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple weeks ago with a friend from out of town. They had a TON of TVs to watch the NBA Finals game and the World Cup matches in any direction. (Since we're sports fans, it was perfect!)  The owner came out to speak to us on several occasions to check on how things were going and make menu recommendations. Food was great. I had the carne asada and my friend had a torta that was so generous in portion size that he took half of it home. Have been back a couple times since and it's been a consistently good time.  We were told about the management change and the owner seems like he's eager to receive input to make things customer focused, as well as a spot for locals to truly enjoy. I think he's on the right track...and I'll keep bringing my friends back!"}
{"text":"Not knowing mas amigos had moved we went here for dinner. confused by the short menu and lack of customer service you order at the front take a number and sit down. I ordered a margarita that tasted flavorless and with no alcohol, my food was not the greatest. Cheap & quick way over priced.service was so so only 2 people working. Would not return there for dinner again."}
{"text":"Oh man what happened??? This place used to be awesome. Now it has all changed and it is terrible! I will never return unless it changes back. No more complimentary chips and salsa? No fountain soda? No dining service?! It was wonderful as an actual restaurant. Now it is unorganized, confusing, and honestly unappetizing. Change back Don Juan and my family and I will return."}
{"text":"The food was good.  It was busy and service was slow because of that, but it was okay.  The chips are good (mas amigos).  I had a supreme quesadilla and it was good."}
{"text":"I had one of my worst restaurant experiences here in quite a while, waiting an hour to be served cold food and having only greasy chips to eat in the meantime. The details...  I arrived with a small group at the beginning of the lunch hour, and our party were some of the first seated. We ordered quickly (with the drinks). We were then served cold greasy chips (one basket for 5 people). Our drinks came about 15 minutes later (water and soda), and then the wait for the food began. We watched every table around us be seated and served before our food came out. Then, about 45 minutes into our time there, *one* person's food came out. Attempts to flag down someone and get info at this point were unsuccessful. Eventually someone from our group got up to find someone.  Finally, about 1:00 to 1:15 into our time there, 3 more meals arrived. Every plate was full of cold food. It was clear the plates had been sitting somewhere else for quite a while. This left one person still without food. More inquiries finally led to someone seeming to care and they said they'd get that food asap. When they served the final plate, which at least was hot, they said they'd comp that meal. This left the rest of us paying for our cold late food.  I don't know what's going on there but clearly they don't know how to run a restaurant or how to prioritize action. Our meals were not complicated (tacos and burritos). Perhaps if the food had been fresh and not cold it would have been good; no way to know. I won't return."}
{"text":"Under the previous ownership, this was my favorite restaurant in C-U. It remains so under the new owners, who have changed the menu only slightly. It's not fancy; the food isn't nearly as exotic or sophisticated as what you get in high-end restaurants; and if you need a lot of veggies EVERY time you eat, this probably isn't the place for you. But I am not a sophisticated person, and my tastes are rather proletarian, and I LOVE this place!  I grew up in Texas, and have loved Mexican food of all stripes--TexMex, New Mexican Mex (my favorite), food I ate in various parts of Mexico. I've always been extremely particular about Mexican food. For decades, friends (who grew up here, not close to our southern border) would recommend various local Mexican restaurants, and we would try them out, and they would be awful (in my opinion). But with this restaurant, we hit the jackpot.  Don Juan's is great if you like plain, everyday Mexican food. Their tacos come in various incarnations (your choice), including \"genuine\" style with hot soft corn tortillas, cilantro, and onions. The homemade totopos are to die for. Their salsa--all three kinds--is wonderful and hot and authentic. I typically order a dinner that includes a couple of enchiladas, a taco, rice and beans (choice of black or pinto).  The prices are quite low. If you don't order drinks, a couple can walk out only about $22 poorer (that includes a 25%-30% tip--I dearly hope you are a generous tipper); and chances are, you'll be carrying some of your dinner home with you in take-out containers the restaurant generously provides."}
{"text":"The owners are very friendly and they know how to make the customer feel welcomed. They have many t.v.'s to watch sports. You can tell that the chips are freshly made. The chips they provide don't have a lot of salt, which is always a plus. The food is the one of the best authentic Mexican foods you can get in the Champaign area."}
{"text":"My family's favorite Mexican place in C-U, by far, since they were Mas Amigos at the old location on Springfield in Champaign. Bummed about the name change, but much of the food and staff is the same, and the new owner is quite visible and interested in hearing from his guests. I am absolutely addicted to the heaping bowls of delicious, hot, freshly-made-on-site tortilla chips that they deliver to your table as soon as you sit down. And the homemade salsa is amazing. Easily best chips & salsa in town, particularly compared to Dos & El Toro. And the food overall is excellent. We've never had a bad meal there. The green sauce that they make from scratch is amazing, and I pour it over everything on my plate. I finish every meal by pouring the salsa over the remaining beans and rice and shoveling it all down. Awesome. Great drink specials and atmosphere. It's not quite Mas, but Don Juan still holds my affection."}
{"text":"I was just there yesterday for a Latin night they were hosting, so my critique is of their bar staff. First and foremost their liquor variety is lacking. So instead of Jameson or Crown, I had to settle for Jack and Coke. The first time they made it correctly and everything was fine. The second time I ordered it (I didn't watch them make it) I got a liquor that was clearly NOT Jack Daniels. The place was pretty busy so I assumed it was an honest mistake. I gave that drink to a friend and went back to order another, and watched them this time. This is what happened:  Ordered my drink and girl turns around and says \"Jack and Coke\" loudly enough for the 2 other people to hear. Guy handling the tabs says \"That's $5.50\" and charges it to my card. Then the other guy makes the drink and proceeds to use a liquor from the well... I had to actually shout across the bar that I ordered a Jack and Coke to have him put Jack in my drink. The tab guy and the drink guy shared an \"oh sh*t\" look with one another. They then let me see my tab when I closed it and it had a rum and coke on there in place of one of the Jack and Cokes as though to make up for it.  Had it not been busy I would have seriously called them out on this issue. They charged me for a Jack and Coke the second time even though I got something that wasn't one. The difference is only a couple of dollars but the fact that they were trying to save nickels and dimes by giving me crap liquor instead of what I ordered is ridiculous. I have been to a great many bars in my time, especially while I was in the military, and I have NEVER had someone swindle me out of what I ordered in this way.  Due to the fact that the guy made my drink correctly the first time, and shared that glance with the tab guy when I busted him is strong evidence that it was not an honest mistake. I will not spend my money in this establishment again and I can only hope those that own this establishment will see this review."}
{"text":"Went here to watch the Colombia vs Uruguay world cup match and the atmosphere was really great, they had a bunch of screens! The food...not so great. The chips they give you for free at the beginning are addicting tho! Im giving it 3 stats instead of two because of that and the $2 Corona special!"}
{"text":"Due to business I am a regular to the Champaign-Urbana area,  and this is my go to spot.  Chips are addicting and the salsa is freshly homemade.  There was a recent ownership change, it used to be \"Mas Amigos\", this change has been to their advantage. It is definitely cleaner and minus a few hip cups in the begin with their staff they seen to have it together now. Food is very cheap, tasty.    If you want tasty, affordable and Authentic  Mexican food in the Champaign Urbana area this is the place to go."}
{"text":"In town for business and walked to this place from my hotel.  It was surprisingly good.  I had chile relllenos.  The poblanos were fresh and cooked properly.  Actually, the waiter recommended the dish.  The one downer was the margarita.  It was syrupy sweet, which I find disgusting.  It was definitely a pre-made mix.  I should have went for a corona.  Anyway, the cost was very cheap, the chips were fresh, and the meal was pleasant."}
{"text":"I guess this is a little too late but someone from Don Juan contacted me to apologize about the experience (which I thought was a pretty good one but perhaps 2 stars doesn't bode well for a business). He was super proactive about it: talked to the chef and offered me a re-do (which I didn't take up). Sorry to hear you guys went out of business. Here's a now useless but redeeming 3 stars.  Original review: Eh, pretty good, pretty good. Just nice, greasy, satisfying Mexican (and TexMex) food. You can have your pina colada come in a pineapple! There was a hair in my food, which is fine because hair falls out. It's what it does. But it still made me queasy. And I had the worst stomach ache after eating here. Too much grease. My huarache was taking a sizzly bath. I'm conflicted between a 2 and 3 because the food was decent. The consequences, not so much. But that pina colada..."}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review on a locally owned restaurant but Don Juan is a waste of money. They have changed the restaurant to eliminate servers. When you walk in, there is someone who takes your order (the person who took our order didn't even know the menu very well). The menu is on a board (like most fast food places) instead of having hard copies. Their menu selection has been cut in half and everything seems more expensive. The burrito, casadilla, chimichanga and something else is $5.95 but make you pay extra for any sides ($2 for rice or beans and $1 for chips and salsa). The Chimichange just had beans and steak in it too, not worth the price! I had the enchilada meal. It came with 3 enchiladas, rice beans and chips. It was not bad, just came out a little cold.  We had to wait 30 minutes to even get our food. The food quality also seems to have gone down. The queso tasted very cheap along with everything else.   Sadly, at the table we were at there were ants crawling all over the place. How digusting!! I loved Don Juan before and now it is so disappointed. Overheard a lot of other people say that they would not be coming back either.  If I was rating the food alone I may give it a 3 stars but with the service and prices.... I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has closed.  See their Facebook post, April 28, 2015.  https://www.facebook.com/donjuan.mex   I was sorry to see Mas Amigos go; Don Juan Cocina just never seemed as good!"}
{"text":"Ever since the change of owners, the quality of the food has declined. Chips are oily because they refry them using oil that is not sufficiently hot. Salsa that came with chips used to be fresh but now it's more on the brown side than tomato red.   Chicken Enchiladas was just so so. - restaurant looked dirty. Acapulco lunch meal was drenched in oil - service was quick and efficient though."}
{"text":"Mexican food on a Saturday night!  We ordered delivery through the eat-cu service because they had a couple of coupons available for Don Juan.  The ordering website was a little tricky to work especially trying to apply the coupons but after we got all that figured out it was fairly easy and our food was delivered in a very speedy ~45 minutes.  I got steak fajitas with rice and black beans while my roommate opted for a steak burrito with rice and refried beans. They also included some chips and salsa with our order too!  The chips looked pretty good but they were a little greasy and kind of flakey in consistency. Probably would have been much better if they were warm but its hard to expect that from delivery. The salsa was not very good, kind of watery and generally lacking.  We were able to choose 2 sides with our orders and we both chose rice and black/refried beans, respectively. Since I got the fajitas though, one of the side options was tortilla shells. This was kind of weird because if I actually wanted to make fajitas I'd have to give up one of my other side selections just to get the shells. But this didn't really bother me because I would have rather had 2 sides and no tortillas anyway. Just a heads up though to all you fajita connoisseurs! The steak meat itself wasn't bad, it mixed well with the peppers and onions but still wasn't anything to really write home about. We both agreed the rice was very bland. My favorite part of the meal had to be the black beans; they were thick, kind of creamy and delicious!  Overall, it was average. I can't complain about the price because we did get a fairly good deal with the coupon even including tip and delivery fee. Without the coupon though, I'd say it's probably overpriced. Still a much better experience than the food I got from Torticas/Burrito King a couple months ago, that stuff was really awful!  Perhaps I should try something else or maybe eat in the restaurant next time."}
{"text":"First of all, free chips! The place could use a little renovation. I had some tacos which were about average fare. I was disappointed that they told us all about their ice cream only to find out that they had none to serve when I actually wanted some. Oh, you can celebrate birthday parties here."}
{"text":"As others have noted, this place is the old Mas Amigos. The food is quite similar to Mas Amigos even though the menu has changed. Many employees are the same, which is to their benefit.   I'm proud to say I'm a regular. This place has excellent tacos Mexicanos. The pastor is probably the best I've had anywhere. In fact, everything I've had on the menu has been quite good.   Before the switch, this was a great margarita place, with incredible prices. I can't speak to neither the price, nor the quality of the margaritas at present.   This place remains my favorite of the Chambana Mexican restaurants. Minor transition issues caused me to give 4 and not 5 stars, but I will revise it upward once the kinks are out."}
{"text":"Food tastes good, service is good, what not to like. Unlike some places the steak on the tacos is not really chewy. The salsa has good flavor. I guess they have dancing on some nights after hours but not sure when it is, I only found that out when I showed up late one night to eat, they still served food, too. I usually get the enchiladas, ask for the bottle of green sauce!"}
{"text":"The food here is super delicious and the staff is always friendly! The enchiladas are spot on. I definitely recommend the pastor on pretty much anything. If you can, try to come in on Tuesdays. There are $1 tacos and 1/2 off margaritas. I had a mango margarita and it was the best one I have had by far. Tasted fresh and was almost too easy to drink! On top of that, the owner is really personable and really cares about his customers' experiences. Highly recommend Don Juan!"}
{"text":"I have only picked up food to go, but what I ordered was correct and pretty good. I had some issues trying to use a coupon, but the owner made everything right. I left as a happy customer and was even happier after finishing my dinner."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have no idea how this place is still open.  Their food is below par and service is as well.  The best thing we ordered was the Lily margarita. The server was extremely pushy, however, he failed to bring us the correct tortillas that we ordered and was not on top of  our regular drinks or chips.  We ordered a super burrito and chicken fajitas.  The food was edible, however, neither item came with sour cream, guacamole or anything of the sorts.  The super burrito did not come with any sides.  The fajitas did not come out sizzling and looked as if it had just been microwaved.  We ordered flour tortillas, however, received corn (which looked old).  Had to ask another server for the correct tortillas, which took awhile to receive.  The atmosphere was completely chaotic...There was no sense of professionalism nor order to the restaurant.  The back wall was not even painted and was just bare drywall.  I would not recommend... go to El Toro."}
