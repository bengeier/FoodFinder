{"text":"Great reviews! If you are going to enjoy a very balanced meal meanwhile deliciously prepared you should try their list of homemade foods and sweets. Well priced and presented! Chief is watching the food quality during your dining and serve you personally what you like when it comes to their delicious and juicy roast beef! Try them once you want to try them more!"}
{"text":"Shaya is a semi regular Thu or Fri lunch. Both days a buffet lunch is provided (turkey Thu, roast beef Fri). The food is always fantastic! On par with the proverbial 'home cookin'. 

The location is rather small and usually turns over a number of times each lunch. It is a make shift restaurant on the front of a catering business. 

Service is as expected for a small operation. The food however always seems to amaze. 

If you work in the area it is well worth dropping by."}
{"text":"This place is gross. I've never left a buffet hungry before but I just had to tap out. The rice was dry, the roast beef was dry, gravy was cool and the desserts were from Costco (no dig to Costco). 

They should add Listerine to the drink menu."}
{"text":"I went here for the lunch buffet over my lunch hour and did not leave hungry. There was a freshly made turkey with all the trimmings (the home made stuffing was amazing!) as well as an array of deserts (I had coconut, pumpkin AND blueberry pie!). A little off the beaten track but definitely worth a visit. The staff were also SO nice - it was a really nice and cosey vibe!"}
