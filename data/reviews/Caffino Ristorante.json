{"text":"Caffino is a romantic, intimate Italian restaurant tucked away in the old Toronto Carpet Factory buildings.  The restaurant has been here for years, long before Liberty Village became trendy! Going in through the back way is really spectacular, you really feel like you've wandered into something hidden. Large windows and high ceilings, interior tastefully decorated with vintage furniture.   Food here is good Italian, rustic and rich. Gnocchi is handrolled and melts in your mouth.  I'm generally really picky about risotto, and they get it right on here: it's cooked with tons of flavour. They make a delish thin crust pizza too! Staff is professional and efficient: you won't find your typical uni student or part timer, but adults that know what they are doing and are not there to suck up for tips. And the front patio is magical on a warm summer evening.   I had my wedding reception here (booked it b/c I loved the venue) and I taste tested many times to make sure it was exactly what I wanted. All of my guests raved about the place afterwards and commented consistently that the food was amazing, not the typical banquet hall rubber chicken and buttered veggies. It's a great place to hold a special event as they are really flexible and Rosa will work with you to make sure you get what you want. Plus you don't have to worry about the noise and you can get the whole venue, patios and bar, pretty much to yourself.   Highly recommended, and there's free parking in the back!"}
{"text":"Booked a reservation through Mic for this Saturday, Jan 26th and apparently the Caffino management has booked a wedding party! No phone call cancelling our reservation and when I called to confirm our reservation, there isn't even anyone who cares??? Left my phone number and absolutely no call back from Mic or the owner?"}
{"text":"I love love love Caffino's.  I've been there multiple times and have had their food catered to the office several times.   I've only been there for lunch and it is generally packed.  My go to's are: - Insalata Salmone:  It's really just the normal salad but the dressing they have is to die for and I can't figure out how to recreate it or find it at a grocery store - Pasta Caffino:  Great pasta and I haven't met someone who didn't like it.  Caffino's is great for having fresh pasta.   - Risotto Umbria:  I was hesitant at first when this dish arrived cause it wasn't really well put together and smelled slightly off putting.  But... it was delicious.  It has a blend of flavours that work real well together.  As much as I love the place, my few put offs about Caffino's include the slow lunch service and the $15 delivery charge.  I work about a 2 min walk from Caffino's and they wanted to charge $15 for delivery after ordering $150 worth of cater food.  I thought it was ridiculous so I came to pick it up myself and they weren't even sympathetic that I was carrying large boxes of food in my nice work clothes."}
{"text":"For the past 12 years, I have been working with a company in Liberty Village.  On my first day, members of the team took me to Caffino's for a welcome lunch.  Everything was amazing:    food, service, location, ambience and decor.  Without going into details about everything, I will comment on its unique location.  It's hidden from the street, any street.  No vehicle traffic in sight.  Located in a courtyard behind a brick and beam building complex.  It's like a secret.  Needless to say, my first lunch there made a great first impression.    Over the years, I have been to Caffino's many times as part of the welcoming crew and I have gone there for dinner with friends on occasion.  My opinion of its greatness still stands.  Caffino's continues to make a lasting impression on all first time goers.  I look forward to every visit because every visit has been special.    My last visit inspired me to create a Yelp account and write my first review.  It was our server Vincenzo who truly made that lunch the best one yet.  A charming Italian gentleman who  takes pride in providing excellent service.  Friendly, knowledgeable, efficient and attentive.  A professional server through and throughout.    Over lunch, we each talked about how good our food was and we all had something to say about Vincenzo and how great he was after we left.  Thank you again!  Lucky for me, we have a new person starting work tomorrow."}
{"text":"Met two friends there for the first time.  Amazing space tucked away but unfortunately they missed the boat on the service end of things.  First we were ignored for a very long time till I hunted down someone and then the food cam out like it was shot from a gun..lol.. This was a Groupon deal and I got the feeling we were treated accordingly .. although we did enjoy two bottles of wine.. I dont see the reason for rushing us.  Staff looked unhappy to be working, stressed.   Food was average .. definitely not bad but nothing special.  Sorry to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent first experience at Caffino! We had seen this location mentioned in passing with good past reviews.   My partner and I had a Groupon for our evening, which included 2 antipasti, 2 entrees, 2 desserts and 1L of the house wine (red or white). There was only one item from the specials and regular menu that was not included in the deal, which  we were really pleased by as we anticipated a very limited menu with the Groupon.   Our server was pleasant and attentive, and we loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. The bread was great - nicely toasted with a light garlic taste. We had the caesar salad and arugula salads to start. Our entrees were the penne alla vodka and chicken parmigiana. And for dessert we had the creme brulee and chocolate truffle cake. All of the food was amazing!!   We were exceptionally pleased with the pricing of the food as well - we had expected the prices to be higher based on the location and will definitely plan to return in the future."}
{"text":"The ambiance is quite nice in the dining area. As mentioned by other yelp reviewers, the food was average. Service in my opinion was lacking"}
{"text":"I have been to many restaurants and my friend this food sure come from a can. You can make better at home even if you are not a good chef... Not good food just a lazy chef"}
{"text":"This was a great place for a relaxed Friday night dinner. Everything we ordered was solid: the veal special came with these great lightly fried potato strings, the rack of lamb was juicy, and the smoked chicken and corn risotto was creamy and sweet. After all that, our tiramisu was a bit of a let down: one small dry square stranded in the middle of a giant white plate. The best part was the setting: it's in an old high-ceilinged factory building with tall windows on three sides. There's another room with a bar that's darker and cozier, with what looked like 50s style furniture. Even though the restaurant was mostly full and has an open kitchen, it was still easy to hold a conversation without raising our voices."}
{"text":"We have walked in here around 4 pm, we were alone there.  We've been ordering from lunch menu.  We've ordered a salad and two pizzas. The salad was really unremarkable, it just didn't come together, the flavours seemed to have been mixed by accident. Also, for the price, the salad was really small. Tune was really bland just from a can. For $15 I would expect couple of slices of seared fresh tuna. The 4 roma tomatoes slices didn't have much taste and looked kind of tired.   The margherita pizza was just ok, the unevenly sprinkled chopped (instead of whole) basic didn't really add much mood. The rest was not much to remember. At least it wasn't burned. Same for pizza bianca - it just really left you with \"so what?\".  It was very hot inside too, no fans were working. Just sizzeling. The washrooms could have been better, given the rest of the place's nice decor.  It was not a groupon. Perhaps they do better in the evening, we aren't coming to check that though."}
{"text":"It was a nice, cosy place. I wasn't blown away by my food but the other people at my table were. It's possible I ordered poorly. The seafood risotto seemed to get all around high fives."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant yesterday and the food was amazing. I had the whole wheat penne with roasted veggies etch. However for some reason the place was really warm and i think the ac wasnt working. I saw a lot of ppl fanning themselves. Hopefully they can fix this soon."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  The wine was extremely reasonably priced. Food presentation was lovely, dishes were served warm and timely. However I agree with others; service lacks lustre.  Our waiter was friendly but often forgot to follow up. Staff didn't look overly pleased to be working. Amazing decor and super cute spot for a date night or girls night out.  Even with the service I'd still go back.    Recommend sharing a pasta as an app."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find but worth it!  I'm wary of higher-end Italian food because it usually tastes the same as the Olive Garden but costs three times the price. Caffino does not fall into that same trap. It is not particularly pricey and extremely high-quality.  The food at Caffino is excellent - I brought my critical foodie mother here and she LOVED it.  The portions are ideal so you'll leave feeling full but not stuffed.  The bruschetta in particular is to die for - the flavours are intense but delicate and perfectly balanced.  The servers at Caffino are quick and attentive. The decor is an interesting mix of traditional and avant garde. My only complaint is the flatscreen TV and the wall ads that you would expect to find in a sports bar chain but not in the intimate bar area of a high-end Italian restaurant.  Caffino is my new go-to place to take visiting family and out-of-town friends."}
{"text":"Hidden away behind an iron gate door on the far end of  King West, Caffino does not get the attention and praise that it should!! The food is AMAZING, the service is always great, the atmosphere is cozy  and the decor is a mixture of modern, classy and cool. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Italian food and I am always on the lookout for popular/highly rated Italian restaurants. I was introduced to Caffino by a gf of mine who choose to have her B-day dinner here. Ever since then it has become hands down my FAVORITE ITALIAN restaurant. Don't be discouraged if when you go, there are a lot of empty tables....eat and you will see for yourself! It kills me that such a great restaurant is so under the radar - give them a positive review if you agree with what I've said! :)"}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant unfortunately ruined the experience for us. We were so excited to try this place and it's got a nice feel however the old man server and man at the bar were miserable and rude to a point we felt uncomfortable. They didn't pick up our dirty dishes for a long time, broke a glass, told us they ran out of bread, and were miserable to fill our drink orders. The food was good but the experience was very unpleasant so I will never be going back."}
{"text":"Came here using a groupon for dinner (this was in the summertime) with my bf.  He lives in the area and we are so glad we got to try this restaurant. I love Italian food and am always looking for an authentic restaurant with delicious fresh food (I have tried many along College and they are mostly average in my opinion).   We had the pasta with pesto and a risotto. Both were absolutely amazing.  You could tell right away it was freshly made.  The prices are average and the place is not by any means \"fancy\" (Someone mentioned it was?) but it's not grimy either.   The server we had was great, food came out quickly and she was great with the recommendations.  I will definitely be returning here as it is my new go to Italian restaurant downtown!"}
{"text":"I had a groupon deal on this place, and I have to say that I was more than satisfy with my meal. I order the calamari and mussel for appetizer. Both were amazing. Then I order the chicken breast and my gf order the salmon. Both were superb too. The service was excellent, and the owner was very nice. Without the groupon, the price were still reasonable."}
{"text":"Was here for a family dinner. we had 10 people and they treated us great. Best experience thus far on our toronto trip. Food was delicious, service exceptional! Look for the address as signage from the street is small."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! The staff are always friendly! It's a nice, quaint restaurant with a really cool feel (all the melted wax candles add a special feel). We get take-out most times from this place and it is always ready before we get there which is awesome! The salads are incredible to start with (especially the house salad, the sauce is insanely good) and I always order the penne arrabiata or margherita pizza, they are both delicious and filling! This is most certainly a place we will continue going back to!"}
{"text":"Caffino's is a little hidden secret in Liberty Village. All the pastas on the menu are delicious and the service is always great. The restaurant also is beautiful with the exposed brick and high ceilings. I have never had a bad meal there and have been a return customer for many years."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service and a great atmosphere. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Italian food."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place with a great vibe and fantastic food. Once you enter an elegant new school vibe greets you to your table. The oso buco melts in your mouth and the NY steak reduction is sweet and salty. A delicious balance of flavours."}
{"text":"We had an AWESOME dinner!!!  Quaint, beautifully restored carpet factory.  Cave Spring Riesling was delicious, not too sweet.  Supremely light seasoned and buttered breaf along with excelleny Caesar and Spinach salads started things off.  Haddock special of the day and the pasta vodka were superb.  Top it off with a decadent Tiramisu and attentive/timely/efficient service and you have an AWESOME dinner experience!   Wish we were to be in town longer as we would definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Definitely will come back. The risotto was cooked perfectly and the server was delightful."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in an area of hustle and bustle. As soon as you walk through the entrance gates it's as if you are transported to a small town in Italy where the wine and food are in abundance and delicious. I took my family here for my Dad's birthday and we thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. We got to experience sitting outside under the stars and when it started pouring we were quickly moved inside so got the best of both worlds. We will definitely be back. The food was all delicious!"}
{"text":"Caffino is a unique Italian restaurant tucked away in Liberty Village.  A little tricky to find, as you enter through a gate off King Street.  We went here on a Tuesday night and it was very quiet-  we had the whole back room to ourselves. The decor is funky, retro and classic, all at the same time. The service was friendly and the food was great! Portions and pricing is reasonable. I would go back."}
{"text":"Very romantic place.. Great for a date night.  Our friend gave us a gift card for Christmas as we like trying different restaurants... Took us a while to finally make a reservations and we were pleasantly surprised. Great food, nice people... We had platter of meats and cheeses .., so good... I had tuna steak kind of taco style.. Very unique and interesting combination of flavours... Very good.. My fiancee had pasta.., was also really good."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, wasn't too crowded when we came and were seated right away. We ordered 3 dishes  Veal Osso Bucco - this was the star dish - the meat was fall off the bone tender, and came on top of a mushroom risotto. Best of both worlds - protein and risotto *drools*. It was my first time trying Osso Bucco and now will look out for this item whenever I go to an Italian restaurant.    BISTECCA A LA GRIGLIA - t bone steak served with veggies and topped with mushrooms. Also good!   Risotto Di mare - seafood risotto - good dish, came with a good amount of seafood.  Overall the quality of the food was excellent, however if you care about atmosphere I would make reservations and ask to be seated in the main dining area. We did not have reservations so we were seated near the bar which had a different feel. The atmosphere of the whole restaurant in general is more rustic, but the side we were seated in looked more dim and run down, and our table was wobbly."}
{"text":"Since I work around here now, this will probably be first of many reviews of Liberty village restaurants . A coworker and I came here today for lunch. Service was friendly and we really liked the atmosphere/decor. We shared the mussels and la toscana pasta dish. Both were amazing and had really generous portions for $16. I loved their flavourful white wine garlic sauce and the texture of their homemade pasta. One of the best pasta dishes I've tried around here. The mussels were really great as well, except some were fully closed and super hard to open? I guess that was my only negative about the food. We also waited quite long for the food to come, so I had to eat pretty quick and run back to work. So if you want a quick lunch, this is probably not the place to go. Anyways, for the price, taste and ambience, I really really like this place!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at this place last night with friends after one of them purchased a Groupon. I have to say that it wasn't the best Italian food I've had in Toronto but it was definitely worth going to. I'll probably go back again. Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Very consistent and reliable.  The dinner service is very accommodating and every dish I have ever ordered here has been well-prepared.  The laid-back atmosphere, reasonably-priced Italian food, fresh daily specials and friendly, informative staff have kept us coming back here for years.   The decor is great too; funky and casual enough for a family lunch yet still nice enough for a romantic evening out."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience here. We had a party of 28ppl. Usually with large groups you'll run into some service issues however this was not the case. Our server was very patient, friendly, and helpful with suggestions!   With the kitchen closing in one hour, the chef managed to prep all of our meals without a glitch. I ordered the beef carpaccio as an appetizer and it was unreal! Very fresh and flavorful. My main course was the Pollo ripieno which is grilled chicken stuffed with goat cheese and carmelized onions topped with a wild mushroom medley. Fuggetaboutit, this was one of the best dishes ive ever tasted... I cant even begin to explain but the other in our party who ordered the same meal, ranted and raved about how good it was!  Def go check out this hidden gem. This is the first time ive ever given 5 stars"}
{"text":"The risotto was excellently executed.  The rest of the meal was closer to average . Our server was clearly a novice, fine if someone is  close by to back her up, but there wasn't. Very pleasant atmosphere in the space near the bar."}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant. I loved how friendly the staff was and how helpful they were. We went in with a baby and they were very accommodation and sweet to my LO"}
{"text":"Came here on a groupon deal - 4 appetizers, 4 entrees, 4 desserts and 1L of wine. I had rounded up a group of 5 to enjoy this Groupon together, only to be told when I called in to make a reservation that only 4 people could use the Groupon. One friend gracefully backed out after I informed the group, but it's unfortunate because this amount of food is definitely enough for a group of 5 to enjoy. And this was confirmed after we left our meal each being super full, and wine unfinished. This was all quite upsetting because the restriction wasn't specified on the groupon (i.e. it could have simply stated \"max 4 per table\"). And to top it all off, the restaurant was far from full on the night we went - so we wondered why we weren't allowed to have 5 people enjoy the food together (as the 5th person wouldn't be taking up a spot of another paying customer).  As for the food, it was well done and the portions were large. For app, ordered the Spinach salad (had sundried tomatoes and roasted garlic cloves), mussels, calamari (on arugula) and eggplant parm. Everything was great - mussels stood out the least. For mains, ordered the tuna on nachos (tuna was good, nachos were overcooked), pescatore (seafood pasta), lamb gnocchi, and risotto. They were all nicely presented and well cooked. I wasn't wowed by any of these dishes though. In the whole 3 course meal, I actually enjoyed the mains the least. For dessert, we had carrot cake, tiramisu, pistachio chocolate crunch, and donuts. Donuts came out fresh and hot which was awesome, but they didn't have enough filling. The pistachio chocolate crunch was incredible - I've never tasted any dessert like it. Made the meal worth it. The rest of the desserts we tried were forgettable."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I had La Toscana with chicken $17. The cream sauce was delicious. Rodney Strong Cab was tasty $12/glass.  Good service from our waiter.  I'd go back for the food even though it's out of my neighbourhood.  Our reservation at 7p had several smaller tables then later in the evening, larger parties were closing the place (our table included).  We were table of 5 reservation. Other tables were 20 and 10 so looks like a popular group dining place.  Close at 10p. A little hard to find but charming inside."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very authentic and fresh, I love the menu and would lick my plate its so good, also have to comment on the service, very hit or miss, and we have had stale bread as well at out table. However that aside the food and portions make up for everything!"}
{"text":"Caffino is a beautiful hidden gem with a lot of character. We discovered this place a few days while strolling around the area at night , hidden in a back alley right by King and Dufferin, and we made a mental note to check it out. Last night we grabbed dinner there and it's now in our list of favorite restaurants in the neighborhood.   The restaurant is nicely decorated, full of wood and candles; the dim light gives you a cozy feeling, and the warm and friendly staff make you feel at home. Our server was of Italian origin - very cheerful, very friendly, and got us a table that was right for our needs (we were a couple so he found us a nice romantic table in a corner).   We had the eggplant parmigiana (great choice), an arugula salad, and the pescatore pasta. We drank water and I had a glass of Chianti.   We paid 85 (tip and taxes included) and I felt it was slightly overpriced, as we just had one main (the pasta) and two appetizers and a glass of house wine, but not too overprice. The only other note would be the quantity of pasta in the pescatore, plenty of seafood but the plate could have a bit more pasta. It was housemate pasta and this might have been the reason for the lesser quantity. These would be the only two aspects I would point out of an overall great experience.   We're looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Hidden behind a metal gate in a former factory, Caffino Ristorante looks like it could belong in the streets of Italy. Eating there, it actually feels like I'm back in Italy - with beautiful and rustic décor, friendly service, and amazing food, it seems like I don't have to get on a plane to enjoy great, authentic Italian cuisine.   I went there for three different occasions and never left disappointed. The Risotto di Mare stands out for me - perfectly cooked and seasoned and definitely delicious.   Overall it was a great experience - if you're near Parkdale, make sure to check out Caffino Ristorante!"}
{"text":"Bought Groupon and tried this place out. It's a lovely hidden restaurant on King St. It's not too pricey, and the food is amazing! The portion is right, not too big or too small. The red wine thst we got was fantastic as well. We'll definitely come back with some more friends."}
{"text":"Caffino is a nice little hidden gem.    The food is generally excellent. The specials change regularly and the print menu is varied enough to appeal to most.  The only reason I don't give Caffino 5 stars is because service can be really hit and miss.  We've had amazing, attentive service and also arrogant, dismissive, snotty service.  Seems random - they need to screen staff better perhaps ;)"}
{"text":"Caffino use to be my \"go to\" date spot.  Its usually quiet in the evenings, with good food at a reasonable price.  I have never been wow'd there, but i generally know what to expect and receive pretty good service too.  It probably wont become your favourite place, but it might work its way into your rotation."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant in the city! The secluded location, ambiance, patios, service, and most of all...the food!!! On top of all that, the price is phenomenal!   I've been recommending the place for years.."}
{"text":"Came with a group for dinner and overall, was pretty pleased. Caffino is tucked inside the old brick buildings that have been well restored on the south side of King St just east of Dufferin. To get inside from King Street you have to enter through some vintage gates which give the place a neat, off the beaten path type of vibe.  The restaurant is broken down into 3 areas: The main dining room which is the nicest area, complete with white table cloths and candlelight. Then there is the bar area which actually is where you'll enter when coming in through King Street. This area is a bit more relaxed and casual vibed, but still quaint and comfy to be in. There is a tv over the bar which was showing a Blue Jays game when we came. Lastly there is a patio area which runs along the side of the building and is facing towards the courtyard area hidden from street view.   Coming for dinner, our group tried a few things and no one left unhappy. First thing you'll get is bread brought to your table which is toasted and covered with a lovely variety of herbs. Dip it in the accompanying oil and balsamic for further flavour enjoyment. I rarely get excited about a restaurants bread, but this stuff was delicious.  Bread aside, I will say that the Veal Osso Bucco was prepared very well. The meat just melted off the bone, and while I'm not a huge fan of mushroom risotto, it was well prepared and did go well with the oh so tender meat. I was able to also try the lasagna, which was good, but admittedly a bit boring, and even their house made hot sauce was a bit bland and unable to give the lasagna the kick up I was looking for.  Service was friendly and on point when we first arrived. Admittedly once the mains were served the attention dwindled and dessert menus weren't even offered until long after our plates were all taken away, and our glasses were completely empty. So at that point rather than order more drinks and dessert, we moved our party elsewhere.  Overall, I still enjoyed the place. I'll be fully honest in saying I'll be more likely to come back for a lunch visit as their lunch menu has some good looking paninis that weren't on the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Can't believe I did not think of coming to this hidden gem sooner! Caffino's decor is a mixture of vintage eclecticism and old world charm. The service was very professional and friendly. The food was delicious and very filling - I had the risotto piemonte and it was one of the best risotto that I've ever had! I am definitely looking forward to coming back for future visits!"}
{"text":"*4.5 stars but I didn't have the heart to round down*  To celebrate getting my Yelp Elite 2015 status today (AWW YEAH!), I decided to go out to dinner at Caffino. I had bookmarked a Groupon for this restaurant to buy one fine day, and today was the perfect occasion.   The Groupon was $70 (not incl taxes) for 2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and house wine (we don't drink so we had this replaced with pop). I called the restaurant up in advance to confirm that I could buy the deal at 5pm, and make a reservation the same night, and was given the green light.   Anyhow, at the restaurant they confirmed that the voucher was valid up to a certain $ value per app/main etc from their regular menu - we were told there may be cases where you have to pay a couple dollars more (we ended up paying $1 extra for our selections only). This is stated on the deal as well and seemed reasonable.  The complimentary bread had a herb spread on it - one of the best complimentary starters I've had!  Our 2 apps were Eggplant parmesan (fantastic - rich tomato sauce, lots of cheese) and Arugula with almond crusted goat cheese (well dressed and apricot slices with cinnamon added to it was a nice touch).  Our mains were Tuna steak and Margherita pizza. The tuna steak was cooked medium rare perfectly, came with delicious crispy wontons and house made guacamole. The margherita pizza was OK but I'd have preferred more cheese.  Desserts were tasty as well but honestly we were too stuffed by that point to truly enjoy - there were several options, and we went with the Chocolate truffle cake and Vanilla/chocolate tartufo.  Our server was excellent! He was nice, joked around a bit, refilled our drinks without us requesting, offered more bread, etc. Also, the service was quick - we never felt rushed but we never felt like we were waiting long for the next course either."}
{"text":"A fancy little restaurant tucked away on the edge of Liberty Village.  To find this place, walk along King St in the area around the Shoeless Joe's.  You'll see a big gate and a walkway that leads into the building (but not inside of the building.)  This takes you to the door of Caffino.  Yes, it's a bit hard to find, but it's a very nice experience.  Your whole meal will probably run in excess of $30, but the food is excellent.  It's a nice fancy place to visit once in a while.  They have a friendly staff that did a good job handling our large group.  Also, while you're there, be sure to ask to see the astrology book they have.  It has something like 2-4 pages for every day of the year, and was disturbingly accurate for some of my friends."}
{"text":"We got married at Caffino in July. We couldn't be happier with our chose. We had a wedding of 100 people and the size of the restaurant and the surrounding space was absolutely perfect for our day of celebration. We held our ceremony in the back ally ways early in the evening and then used the premise for our wedding photos. Th inside of the restaurant was able to accommodate 50% of our guests and the other 50% was seated outside under the stars. The setting and atmosphere was romantic, relaxing and very European.  You'd think you were in Italy. The food that night was fantastic and presented beautifully. Cocktails were lovely and the casual bar setting worked well for my new Irish family ;)  By the end of the night, we were dancing under the stars. The best part was that our guests were free to roam the premise and enjoy a very relaxing night. Both my husband, my guests and I truly enjoyed our experience at Caffino.   Stephanie was great at keeping the plans and the day simple and organized. The staff that night could not be better. They made the transition between ceremony, cocktails, dinner to dancing seamless and easy. They were also very friendly and extremely accommodating.   Thank you, Caffino!"}
{"text":"Came here for a long over due date night with my boy friend. I had booked this reservation ages ago in hopes for a nice evening with my significant other... This jewel of a place has a beautiful rustic, warm and authentic feeling to it. However, when we arrived we were promptly greeted but we weren't asked if we had a reservation, and just plopped down, which was a bit disappointing because it took away that I had been on their dining list for the past month (also, what if it was a special occasion and I requested a special seat or service). When we were seated the usual water and drink order came. Then we ordered the calamari for $18.00 and asked for a side of bread while we pondered our entree orders. Our calamari came and we were completely underwhelmed by the bits of squid on a bed of lettuce and so much so that we were hesitant on ordering more food. So, we tested one more dish and it was the luigia pizza. The pizza was lacklustre and bland... I did see some dishes go by that looked hearty and well prepared, but if you can't get pizza right or even a simple calamari dish, I'm not going to experiment any further. Please keep in mind throughout our dining experience our server did not come to check on us once, did not ask us how our meal was during or after.  Nor did he notify us of the specials on  the menu or asked if we had any questions. Finally $65 later for two beers, one calamari and one pizza we paid by credit card and the server ripped out the bill and walked off. That was that.  I honestly have never felt like a restaurant has given me the one finger salute until now. If you like Italian food and want that low key rustic feel and not spend and arm N a leg. Go to Gio Rana's on Queen East. Dear Caffino, get better management ... really really disappointed  Date of dining : sept 8, 2017 at 7:00pm"}
{"text":"Visited on 20/02/2016 at 7p.m.  Lately I have been planning dates via Groupon as it allows us an opportunity to visit places we would not regularly visit, as they are not chains that advertise 24/7 on t.v. This has given us the chance to find many gems. Caffino Ristorante is one such gem.  Groupon :- 2 antipasto, 2 Entrée, 2 Desserts and 1/2 liter of wine (Red or White)  The bartender was an instant favorite of ours and we were happy to be seated in a comfortable setting in the bar, it also allowed me the time to enjoy the ambiance and room design. It had a warm, welcoming feeling to it and it made me feel quite at home, the walls and decor had charm and character that reminded me of a villa. The bartender whose name I unfortunately can't remember was a tall, professional gentleman who smiled and joked with ease, his manners made you feel comfortable. He helped us choose a wine and took our order for our antipasto and drinks.  He brought us out our 1st of all flavours of the Martinis we set out to try that night. I had the chocolate and my boyfriend had the Espresso. As we sipped on our expertly crafted drinks, warm bread with an aroma of butter and garlic was brought out by the bartender. We had been greeted at the beginning by a younger person who had claimed to be our server but disappeared in the course of the night, we preferred the professional mannerism the bartender brought to the experience and service... so one could only be greatful our server was sparse.  My boyfriend had the Arugula Salad with roasted pear & goat cheese while I had the Grilled Calamari, both were light dishes that served to wet the appetite, flavorful and well balanced. It was an exceptional start to the meal. As drinks and wine flowed our meal progressed in a timely manner, we never felt rushed or forgotten and I can say the bartender is credited with that level of exceptional service. Our Entrées were both delicious and filling. I had the Veal Osso Bucco and my boyfriend had a Lasagne dish called Nonna's Lasagne. Both dishes were superb, with distinct flavours that paired well with our wine.  Dessert however was the weakest part of the meal. I had the Tiramisu and my boyfriend had the Creme Brulee. I suggest the creme brulee as the tiramisu was unfortunately quite unimpressive .   Negative :- Our server checked to see how things were going about 3 times, only to bring up at each unfortunate encounter that we had a Groupon. I might as well have had the plague as his manners towards the 'groupon' was condescending and right down verging on being a complete and utter idiot. At the end of our meal this Phantom entity that we barely saw all night emerged to present to us the bill... with a Services charge no less happily written in and added to our bill about $28-$29 a fair 15% tip and granted less than we generally leave...but to not tell us was insulting. He should have let the bartender continue to do his job, his tip would have been bigger and I truly hope the bartender got a share.  In all a great experience as long as our server was not around.

{"text":"Caffino is a nice little gem that's hidden in Liberty Village. I didn't know this place existed until a colleague suggested it for lunch.   I love the decor of this place; it is romantic, yet also laid-back. This would be a great place for a lunch date.  I had the Robert De Niro Panini, also known as a Steak and Mushrooms Sandwich and it was appetizing. I've been told the pizza and risotto are also very good here.  The food was brought out pretty quickly, and our waitress was attentive, checking with us every now and then to make sure everything was okay. The prices are reasonable here and the portion sizes are decent.   I'm in the area often, so I'll be sure to come back and try out other dishes, including the gnocchi - one of my colleagues had and it looked delicious!"}
{"text":"I think I've been here three times (including this review and date of posting); all three times were to grab dinner before a show (Fall Out Boy concerts, and a Welcome to Night Vale show).  The location is a little bit random (those gates are super sketchy) but it's tucked away in a nice corner of Liberty Village that is cozy.  The food is reasonably priced and the options are great.   For my latest meal, I had the goat cheese ravioli and it was delicious.  The waiters were friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was great (we basically had the entire informal dining hall to ourselves because we made a 6:15pm reservation for Tuesday).  Definitely coming back here again!  Also-- they just recently started using OpenTable for reservations, so no more calling to book a table! (lol)"}
{"text":"Today at noon I was delighted to lunch at Caffino with a client plus colleague. I ordered the beef carpaccio - excellent, substantial, impressive. I had the pasta caffina for my main and a mimosa to drink. I love pesto and this dish delivered. I was worried it would be too creamy but it wasn't, the creamy style of pesto added in this case. The atmosphere is charming, gorgeous, cozy, rustic meets old world and new. The ladies room also impressed. I only give them 4 stars because an onion cooking made all of our eyes sting I had to wear sunglasses indoors like a diva. I will note that two fabulous women sauntered in and I thought they were famous but they were actually servers! You must experience Caffino Ristorante. Our waiter was from Bologna and quite adorable adding to the overall, \"I am in Italy not in Parkdale\" vibe that Caffino offers. Bring your cameras!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in liberty village, with the exception of Mildred's.  The food is head and shoulders above the other establishments in Liberty Village since the Chef is a true seasoned professional specializing in Fine Food and Haute Cuisine.   And the prices are actually very decent!  T-Bone steak for $22.  Goat-cheese stuffed chicken breast in wild mushroom sauce for $21.  They have lunch specials every day for $10, and the Perronni draft beer is always on special for lunch.    The ambiance is amazing.  The place used to be a factory, so huge windows with tiled panes, old-world radiators and french-bistro-like tables.  I love the melted candles at the entrance!"}
{"text":"Do you like authentic Italian food? Creamy, perfectly cooked risotto and a dreamy date-like atmosphere? Caffino may be right for you! I want here on a Groupon last year and ordered their special Risotto. All I remember is that it had thick chunks of bacon, peas, asparagus and a creamy sauce. It was a perfect pairing of the salty, rich flavours of the pork with the bright, fresh taste as the peas burst open in your mouth(and I'm not usually a fan of peas). I had a total craving for this yesterday. I wish it was a regular item on their menu. Server was kind, knowledgeable and gave real advice on the food based on my personal tastes - something that is very rare and appreciated. Definitely a romantic atmosphere. I do not recommend it for families."}
{"text":"Came here last night to celebrate my birthday with a Groupon.  When my husband and I arrived, we sort of stood around while a waitress/bartender was cleaning glasses behind the bar (near the entrance). Another waiter passed by us as well... Then a group of 4 came in and the lady/bartender immediately tended to them and had them seated. I was a bit confused as to why we were ignored .... But I didn't want to let that get my birthday down. Finally an elderly gentleman waiter seated us and apologized for the young lady. No big deal I thought.... Now for the food: Seemed like everyone in the dining area was using a groupon. We had the choice of 2 antipasti, 2 entrees and 2 desserts... Plus house wine... Bonus! Ambiance was great! Very warm, romantic feel. I ordered the pear and arugula salad for my antipasti and my husband ordered the grilled calamari... My salad was the bomb dot com! Loved the goats cheese covered in almonds! It was great! The grilled calamari was not the best... Very chewy, rubbery and was a bit burnt.. So my husband didn't eat his antipasti. For entrees I had the t bone veal, and he had a potato and mushroom pizza in a white sauce. The pizza had whole (un-roasted) garlic cloves covering the cheese... Why??? At least roast the cloves. My husband bit into a few because he mistakened them for potatoes... The pizza was in no way authentic italian wood oven burning etc ... Very mediocre pizza... My veal dish was $32 and was it worth it? Not in my opinion. It was cooked perfectly, the sauce was a nice compliment and the mushrooms were great! But lacked that ooomph flavour. a little blahh.  It was definitely better than the pizza though. Now to dessert... I ordered the chocolate truffle cake because I'm a sucker for chocolate... And my hubby ordered the tiramisu ... The waiter told us that the tiramisu and bomba (homemade filled donuts) were made in house and that the rest of the dessert options were ordered in from bakeries etc... That being said, The tiramisu was okay... My cake was awesome. Food all in all was a 2.5/5. Would I come back? No.  Now for the service: so if we forget the whole seating debacle at the beginning the service was still a solid 2/5. We had the older gentleman waiter... Vincenzo?? Can't remember... Anyways, he seemed to be rushing us to order, seemed to be bothered if we asked him for water/bread etc... And barely tended to us. The other waiters (all the younger ones)... Were amazing! If Vincenzo ignored us, we were helped by the younger guys that worked there with a smile and an apology (for not getting water till after our main course or bread before our main arrived or the bill after a whopping 45 mins after we were finished our dessert waving our arms at Vincenzo... ) never have I ever waited so long for a bill or felt so ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy because of all the groupons... But then they should staff accordingly. They only had 3 waiter/esses working on a Friday night ... These 3 also worked behind the bar.... It just seemed like the older waiter was overwhelmed by the crowd and didn't know how to prioritize. Oh well! So much for my birthday dinner! I'll stick to Il Mulino!"}
{"text":"I came here before quite often but this might be the last time I come. I came here with a group of co-workers to grab lunch and Vince, our waiter, was already giving us some bad vibes. When we first stepped in and told him there's 4 of us, he grabbed menus and walked away without telling us that he's taking us to our seats. We waited a full few minutes before I decided to peer through the next dining area and ask whether those seats are ours.   When we came to order, he had the worse grumpy face on (and the entire time after). After we made our orders, two of our coworkers swapped seats. When the food came, we told the waiter which order is which girl's and he gave us an attitude and made a gesture like we aren't allowed to swap seats.   Every time we had to interact with him, his tone of voice (almost yelling) and face had been stern and borderline rude. We can tell he didn't like us. Meanwhile, I watch him serve other guests with a smile. Not trying to place a race card here but we're a group of Asian women and all the other guests were white. He didn't seem to take a liking to us from the beginning. We were polite the entire time too.  When it came to asking for the dessert menu, he brought 4 menus over and simply tossed the stack onto the table and walked away. Very unimpressive. We tried to be polite but we we're giving each other looks by the end of our meal. We opted not to bother staying for dessert as we did not want him serving us anymore. Needless to say, we tipped less than what we normally do to get the message across. Even during the process of paying, the waiter simply ripped  the receipt and tossed it over and walked away. Good job, Vince. You work in the customer service industry. At least pretend to look like you're enjoying your job.  Rude waiter, terrible service. Food is good but would not want to be served by Vince again."}
{"text":"A friend of ours discovered this charming, quaint, darn-near hidden restaurant just west of Liberty Village. I've no clue how she found it, but it made the perfect spot for our wedding ceremony.  My wife-to-be had exacting attributes in mind for our ceremony venue, and Caffino hit all the right notes in terms of appearance and ambiance. Nice textures, natural materials and surfaces, and plenty of natural light. What sealed the deal was in fact the fantastic environs. Unadorned brick laneways, older era buildings, and low density (both cars and humans). In fact, you could liken the area to a quieter Distillery District. As beautiful as that area is, I think it's near impossible to take wedding pictures throughout it without being mobbed by the hoi polloi. Conversely, we had the area surrounding Caffino, and then walking east towards Liberty Village, all to ourselves with nary a soul in sight. Perfect.  We didn't actually have any food there - just coffee and tea service, and a cash bar. But service was tremendous, and they were fantastic in helping us pull off our day.  11/30"}
{"text":"Hand made noodles. Nothing beats it. Italian dessert alcohol drinks? Reminds me of my dinners with my Italian family friends being here. Do reservations on fridays. It tends to get busy. Only been here for two weeks for work and have came back here three times."}
{"text":"Came across this place while walking around Liberty Village. My food experience was pretty meh, portions are not on the large side, and service is average as well. Had the lamb burger (dry and missing other components, like some nice arugula or something) and a side salad (some leaves a piece of cucumber and a cherry tomato).   What really makes this place great is the location. It is nestled between the buildings in Liberty village to create a kind of hidden courtyard feel hidden in the brick, but the ambiance is beautiful and so relaxing on the patios. I would definitely come back just to sit on the patios and enjoy a nice drink!"}
{"text":"Great spot, intimate and good food. Great for a small group or even a date. I tried the pizza, and gnocchi both were delicious and filling. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Originally we had put in a reservation online for 7pm and was told that someone would call back for confirmation. We never got the confirmation, so I called at 4 and was told there was an opening at 9pm. When we got there, we waited until about 9:30 before being seated. They were quite busy and the owner and staff continuously apologized for the delay. They even gave my partner and I a drink on the house for the wait and the reservation mistake.   Going to the meals, My partner and I had a Groupon for this restaurant.  It included 2 antipasti, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and 1 liter of house wine. We started with the wine which you get either red or white. We got the white and surprisingly it was very good. Their house wine was priced at $40 for the Liter. My partner and I had the Caesar salad and the Calamari. The salad was okay, nothing special, however the calamari was great. We then had two different risotto for our main entrees. He had the mushroom risotto, while I had the risotto del mar (seafood). Both were exceptionally good.  Our desserts were very good as well, a chocolate mousse cake and a chocolate and vanilla ice cream.  Overall we were very well treated and the food was exceptional. I'd highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My Wife took me here for my Birthday. It was the second time We had been there, both times with a Groupon. I often fear that when using a Groupon the service will be affected, this was not the case with Caffino. In fact, Our server, I believe his name is Vincenzo, went way above and beyond to make sure we had an amazing time. This was perhaps the best service Ive ever received at a restaurant. Thank you for helping make Our dining experience so great!!  Along with great service was great food. The lamp chops on gnocchi was one of the best tasting meals Ive ever had, seriously!!. Whatever that sauce was, that glaze, WOW!!!!! Try it and let me know what you think. I have pictures which I will post soon. We cant wait to go back again soon!!"}
{"text":"First, I'm going to get the bad part out of the way. I wasn't to impressed with the tip (%15 aka $28.00)being added on to our bill in advance and not even telling us.  However, it was well deserved in the end. The first thing I want to talk about is decor. We were seated in the bar area (didn't see the actual restaurant seating but that's actually fine). They gave us the option and we took our seats. Every table was unique as in the variety of them. Paintings and mirrors were all over but not to many as to take your attention away from your food. The waiters were amusing and well into understanding as we were late in getting there due to accidents on the hwy. They treated us with utmost respect and checked on us regularly. Drinks. They make some fabulous and Divine drinks. We sampled all 4 martinis. I suggest the espresso martini. The bartender knew what they were doing. Food. My gf and I enjoyed (from our groupon) 3 courses of well prepared antipastos mains and desserts. I had a salad to start, my gf had the calamari.  She comments it was the best grilled calamari she's ever had. Then came my \"nonas lasagna\" and her veal, both prepared perfectly. Creme brûlée and tiramisu for dessert. I highly recommend coming here.  The staff will greet you in a way that'll make you want to stay and the food will make you stay......... Or else  Groupon? No problem and no fixed menu. You can order anything you like, just pay the difference.  Which was appreciated.  Two antipastos. Two entrees. 2 desserts and half a litre of wine."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon to use here.  My work schedule was insane and the days I could use it were limited.  My partner and I decided to celebrate my birthday here.  Unfortunately she got sick and we had to cancel.  I called 10 days in advance before it expired to make a another reservation.  I was informed that the last day the Groupon was valid, the restaurant was closed for a private function (that's a breach of contract).  I asked if they could extend it but the person on the phone wasn't in authority to do so and I was promised a callback from the manager.  After multiple calls on multiple days, I never received a call from anyone in authority who could extend the Groupon.  I contacted Groupon to complain about the lack of communication from Management.  Groupon issued a refund.  I see all the 5 star reviews, and I guess I will never know how good the food is because they never allowed me to step foot in the door.  Too bad for them as we could have been repeat customers."}
{"text":"I am usually wary of trying out Italian restaurants (espc. Little Italy fare); if the food isn't done right I always end up thinking: Why did I waste money on something that I could've made at home! Ergo, warily I sought out Caffino.   Like Colleen mentioned, Caffino is a charming and intimate place. It's simply decorated; the candelabras with melted wax,resembling stalactites, caught my eye. Added to the romantic flair.  Our server was very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. I ordered the Penne a la Puglia which was delicious: very flavorful, fresh and filling. My friend ordered the Margherita pizza which was equally great: no complaints at all.  We split a cheesecake for dessert and were clutching our stomachs after, we were very happily full!  I really enjoyed my experience at Caffino: it's intimate enough for you to have a private conversation without bumping elbows with other patrons; and the food and the service are worth ever penny (they could even get away with charging more). Caffino is fantastico!"}
{"text":"I think this is my first 5 star review! I couldn't find one critique of our meal at all!   First off I have been wanting to come here for ages! Thank goodness their groupon was still available for purchase! $89.99 for 4 people, was a small family get together.  The atmosphere of this restaurant in the main room was homey & quaint! However in the second room, it was cozy and romantic! It's true what the other reviewers said very romantic!   The food was superb! First off the bread, I have a love for warm bread at restaurants! It's such a simple but rare offerings? This place not only toast their sliced baguettes  but it's also a bit garlic seemed like a light garlic spread was already spread on it! Warm and toasty!  Appetizers: My eggplant parmigiana, eggplant was nicely breaded, the tomato sauce was sooo yummy!  We also had the mussels, grilled calamari (tender and not over done!) and the beef carpaccio! All nicely portioned!  Main: My veal chop (off of the daily special) was fantastic. Perfect medium, the sauce was to die for! A rich reduction with some sort of cream drizzle We also had a T-bone steak, the fish which also came with like a crab meat rice, and a seafood risotto all tasting delicious  Dessert: I had the pumpkin cheesecake (also off of the daily special menu), I usually don't like pumpkin so was very reluctant to try this but gave it a go. Am glad I did coz it was like a taste of heaven! The pumpkin wasn't too overwhelming, the cream cheese and pumpkin conmbination was a perfect balance along with a bit of the whole pumpkin spice! Kind of like starbucks PSL in a dessert! The cookie crust bottom was crunchy indicating it must have been recently made! we also got the tiramisu, tartufo, gianormous slice of truffle cake. I still liked my cheesecake the best! They had a whole lot of other selections like cannoli, creme brûlée, a pistachio mousse crunch which they ran out on. Overall a very extensive dessert menu!   I was reluctant to write this review as I wanna keep this place a secret! But on a wed night it had only three other tables of twos! This place is such a hidden gem that I really want it to stick around!  Can't wait to go back and try their pizza! Overall a scrumptious Italian feast!"}
{"text":"True, charming but nothing outstanding about the food. I can't call this place authentic Italian...."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto on holiday and came for dinner. First, the ambiance in the backroom is very romantic. The mixed drinks and wine were very good. The rosemary bread, alone, is worth going. We started with the grilled calamari, which I highly recommend. I got the pasta special: ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach with a tomato cream sauce. Amazing. You can tell it's all handmade pasta. I highly recommend. My only criticism is the service was a little too fast for the setting, I felt rushed and not all the tables were full."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I loved everything about Caffino! The decor is very vintage and rustic, which adds to the restaurant's charm.   I had purchased a Groupon voucher for a 3 course meal for two with wine. To our surprise they provided us with 1L of wine! I was honestly shocked, I believe it was a house wine, but it was actually very delicious. Our server was extremely helpful and very courteous. Even though we had a Groupon we were treated the same as any regular paying customer. I ordered the spicy mussels, La Veneziana pasta, and the Lindt chocolate tartufo for dessert, and I honestly have no complaints about any of it. The wine was delicious and the food was cooked perfectly, I will definitely be coming back in the furture!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quick lunch with some coworkers on a sunny Wednesday afternoon. To be honest we didn't originally intend to visit Caffino since none of us had even heard of it. But, I'm so glad our original choice of lunch spots was closed that day and we noticed the sign for this place.   First of all, this place is so charming. Located in an old factory building nestled amongst many similar other ivy covered buildings, it feels really secluded even though its only a few steps away from the bustling activity of Liberty Village. We grabbed a seat on the partially shaded patio because I feel strongly that you should always sit on the patio if you can.   All three of us are suckers for pasta so even though we had to go back to work and would later require large coffees to do so, we went for it. As a vegetarian I was pleased to learn that, since all dishes are made to order, its easy for the chef to leave out the meat in any of the dishes should you want. I was really into the idea of the Gnocchi La Romana (which features asparagus, prosciutto and gorgonzola cream sauce), but was not so into the prosciutto part. No problem.   We were served bread with olive oil and balsamic while we waited for our meals to arrive, which wasn't very long at all. All three of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals and the lovely service. And since we were on lunch and not boozing it up, we were left with a very reasonably priced bill."}
{"text":"Caffino is absolutely amazing!! Loved this place! Great decor, amazing food and the wait staff is attentive and professional. House red wine was delicious! We had the arugula salad with pear and the caprese salad to start. Both were great! We ate the beef risotto and the veal for the main. Both were melt in our mouth fabulous!! And the dessert was great too, the traditional tiramisu was fresh and divine as well as the tartufo. Can't wait to back!! Great spot in liberty village. You must visit if you haven't yet!!"}
{"text":"A gorgeous intimate restaurant with above par meals - excellent taste & presentation! Perfect date night or group outing. Meals pictures are their sesame tuna, lamb gnocchi, seafood risotto & pistachio sponge cake."}
{"text":"I'm already updating my Caffino Ristorante review, because I have already returned, and they deserve the five star bump. What a delight!   My husband and I had cocktails and mussels followed by pasta and wine on their patio while our baby napped and it was a near perfect evening. Saying this is a hidden gem is such a cliché, but goddamnit, that's what it is. Check out Caffino, it's a shiny hidden gem."}
