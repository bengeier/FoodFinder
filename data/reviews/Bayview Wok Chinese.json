{"text":"Ordered the black pepper beef tenderloin to try this restaurant out. Very happy when it got here.  HUGE Container. It's bigger than other plastic containers, almost twice as tall! I have two pictures one of the top with a soy sauce packet as a reference for size and a side shot showing how tall the container is. Soy sauce packets are about the size of a standard ketchup packet.   The portion of food is large and its a large variety of stir fry with a large amount of beef.   Flavour is great and well seasoned. Not drenched in oil which is a great thing!  Very clean Chinese restaurant and high quality food. Beef was very tender!   No complaints! This will be my new Chinese restaurant to go to. I am Chinese too and have tried many Chinese restaurants. Most have low quality but not this one!  I'd recommend anyone to try it you won't be disappointed!   Owner is very friendly too. I talked to him on the phone, ask whatever question you want before ordering. He will make sure it's made correctly!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious. Very fresh and crispy egg rolls. $5.99 lunch combos. I have been returning day after day for lunch! Worth a try."}
{"text":"Came in here on a whim as it's not easy to find a decent Canadian Chinese restaurant within Richmond Hill and Markham.  Tasty, cheap, and delicious lunch combos offer delicious veggie fried rice, chicken is fresh.  Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu.  Seating is extremely limited to 8 people."}
{"text":"I ordered some black pepper beef, wings and spring rolls for delivery; however they sent me the wrong beef and some other chicken. At least the spring rolls were there and good. Food tastes pretty bland too. I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Great food ! It's has Hk style favour. Not the Canadian Chinese food style. The server was too shy and not really have customer skill. But he is polite lol the chef actually come out to ask how's the food and ask us please do share ideas . Overall , good food good price . Look forward to try their BBQ pork rice. They sold out !"}
