{"text":"This place is Great! Went here for my first time tonight and will definitely be back. The food was super fresh and was prepared very quickly.   I ordered spicy drunken noodles with tofu and added veggies. Yum! It was a little sweet even with the spice. So good!  This place is right near the AMC theatre, so a great place to catch a bite before or after a movie or doing some shopping. The staff was very friendly and helpful to answer my many questions. Check them out!"}
{"text":"We went tonight for dinner and had amazing customer service. They went out of their way to make sure we were happy. This restaurant is super clean too. Food was hot and fresh. Our daughter told the server that her birthday was the day before and they asked us if they can give her ice cream.  They made her a nice plate of delicious coconut pineapple ice cream. We would go again."}
{"text":"This is absolutely a must visit restaurant and a hidden gem located in the Stapley/60 plaza!  Authentic Thai cuisine and gorgeous presentation. The owner, chef, and greet staff are very energetic, engaging and friendly. Heart felt care and a customized feel is added to each meal, and the presentation is incredible. I've visited four times and  each time I leave perfectly satisfied. You can expect a unique, non-American dish every time! I absolutely recommend that you give them an opportunity to prove it to you too."}
{"text":"Great food.  They have a special Basil Crispy Chicken which was incredible.  We had the bacon wrapped prawn appetizer and sauce is house made...yum!   Friendly service completes the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"quality of food is excellent  awesome fast service  next to movie theater AMC in Walmart strip mall  enjoyed my first time there  tried eggplant shrimp and basil tofu  high recommend"}
{"text":"Great drunken noodles! The staff is very friendly and prices are pretty decent for lunch."}
{"text":"Had the fresh rolls with freshly made peanut sauce.  Delicious!  Chicken noodle was tastey too!"}
{"text":"My daughter took me to lunch at this place. She has special dietary needs and has eaten here before.  We walked in as they were opening for the day. Our server/owner (Some, as in Awesome) greeted us and was very upbeat and friendly. She took my daughter's order and turned to me. Not being that familiar with Thai food just told Some to surprise me and make it exciting. She nervously, excitedly began giggling and kept asking what I liked. I told her there is not much I didn't like and it was totally up to her. She quickly retreated to the kitchen and return shortly with my daughter's order of chicken curry and a boat shaped dish for me piled with greens, cashews and sliced mango. I dug in and was pleasantly surprised at the combination of flavors and spices of this very fresh salad. My daughter pointed out to me that there was something under the foliage, I moved some of it to the side and observed a piece of fried fish. The next bite was wonderful. The exciting combination of the salad and fish was fabulous. I later found out that the perfectly fried fish was catfish. I've eaten a lot of catfish but this was perfectly seasoned, lightly dusted and fried. All I can say is this is my new favorite place.  Some is really awesome."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is awful. Basically plain flavorless noodles. I do not recommend ordering this dish. I judge Thai restaurants by their pad thai and their curry. I suppose I will give them a second chance with curry but I'm highly disappointed in these plain noodles."}
{"text":"We didn't want to go in because it didn't have many reviews, but we ended up trying it while waiting for our movie. It was very authentic and very good. Reasonable prices, decent portions, great quality"}
{"text":"THE BEST Tom Kha soup I have ever had! Fair warning, \"hot\" really does mean spicy, but it is so good! I always get it with extra pork because it marries well with the mushrooms and other veggies plus the flavor of the broth. I have literally eaten this about 10 times in the past month or so. The only reason for the mark down in stars is the fact that the potstickers I had the first time were pretty greasy and kind of overcooked, but the crab rangoons I got last time were tasty and my mother really liked the yellow curry with chicken!"}
{"text":"Some the best Thai in AZ. The service is amazing , the atmosphere and energy are very inviting. Highly recommend Thai Time Kitchen !!!!!"}
{"text":"Walk in by accident.    They're food was delicious!  Would defiantly come back . Owner made great recommendations and we tried them and were very impressed. They use all fresh ingredients so it taste a little different but if you want real Thai food this is the place to come"}
{"text":"This was just about the most perfect and enjoyable dining experience we've ever had. Our server seemed to be the owner and she was so sweet, so funny, and so attentive. My kids ordered vegetarian dishes and she made sure to ask them if egg was ok in case they were vegans. To me, that's gold! Their food was so amazing. They got the Thai fried rice and pad see ew both with fried tofu. I got seaweed soup and it was honestly not my fave, BUT I think that has everything to do with my personal preference and not the actual quality of the soup. I've never ordered a soup that I like from a Thai restaurant, so I'm pretty sure I just don't like Thai-style soups. We also got the angry edamame and...oh my god....it was one of the best things I've ever tasted! We'll definitely be back. We love this place."}
{"text":"Great service,  and delicious food.  We eat Thai often so are always trying new places and Thai time passed the test! We got fresh shrimp spring rolls, Tom Kha soup was superb, red curry with chicken, and beef with drunken noodles! All delicious! We finished off with Mango ice cream! Yummmm"}
{"text":"While the owner is very nice and welcoming I cannot give a food review on this place. It is nice and clean inside and the menu prices are very affordable which earns mu two stars but I guess you get what you pay for. The first time I ate her with someone they said their curry tasted weird but my Pad See Ew was good.  My Thai Bowl across the street is better but also a tad bit mkre expensive but has a larger portion size.....none the less it wasnt bad. This second trip I got a Garden delight and my mom got Thai Fried rice. It was just diagusting. It tasted bland at first and the medium didn't even have any spice for either of us. We added more chili but it still just didn't do the trick.  .y stomach hurts now like I just drank oil and I cannot get this disgusting taste out od my mouth. I think I will stick yo the slightly more pricey My Thai Bowl and get more flavorful quality food."}
{"text":"This was very yummy!!! I had the Gra Pow chicken. Bob had the fish with mango salad. My obligatory Thai Iced Tea, because it runs through my veins. The owner/ server was so kind. There is outdoor seating so we brought Pico-the-Guy-O."}
{"text":"Great place for reasonable priced Thai lunch. Recommend the drunken noodles with beef or sweet and sour chicken. Thai iced tea is really good as well. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! The excessive amount of lights almost deterred me from coming here, but you can tell there's Thai authenticity within this restaurant. Locally owned and operated, I enjoyed meeting the owner and eating food that could have come from her own kitchen. Highly recommend the Tom Yum: not oily, loads of lemongrass flavor, and a variety of veggies made an excellent soup."}
{"text":"Love Thai food & loved it here!  Their edamame is topped with salt & red chili flakes, super tasty.  My vegetarian friend got a pumpkin curry. It had so many veggies in it! She absolutely loved it.  I loved my drunken noodles with chicken.  We topped off the night with sweet sticky rice. I loved it. My friend who's lived in Asia said it's one of the best sticky rices she's ever had.  Great experience here."}
{"text":"This is an updated review. I previously left a 3 star review, but decided to give them another try and oh, my stars! It did not disappoint! The service was excellent, very friendly and fast. The food was incredible. The sticky rice was perfect, and curries were authentic and delicious. The calamari were crispy, golden rings, which is just the way my daughter and I like them (calamari with tentacles freaks us out!). The portions are definitely worth the price - we had enough to save for tomorrow's lunch. I am so glad I gave this local family business another try. We will most definitely be back to try other dishes, and some dessert!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai food place !!!!! I thought I had to go to San Diego for amazing Thai food but not anymore !!! The food place clean and trendy! The food is fresh and clean!!!  We had Pad Thai 12/10 rating !  Pineapple fried Rice 10/10 Shrimp spring rolls 10/10 (peanut sauce yummy!)   Dessert see below so creative"}
{"text":"I ordered catering from Thai Time for an office lunch. We had the Coconut soup, yellow curry, and pad Thai. Great portion sizes and the food was delicious! The owner personally delivered the food. She took pride in setting everything up correctly and explained toppings for each dish. I'll definitely use Thai Time for catering again in the future. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! The food is to die for and the service is great. This is definitely my new favorite spot"}
{"text":"Very good! Very friendly! Great spring rolls! Will have to come back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in a part of the Phoenix metro we weren't too familiar with, and we were getting hungry because it was suppertime. We found a shopping plaza at Stapley near Baseline, and some Christmas lights flashing in a store window caught my eye. The sign said \"Thai Time.\" I love Thai food and was intrigued, so we wandered over. We went inside and, while the place is not huge or overly lavish, the food was AMAZING! My husband is on a low-salt/low-sugar diet and asked if they could make the edamame without salt, and they said yes! It just had garlic and red pepper flakes and was AWESOME! I wanted Pad See Ew (a noodle dish) but not with chicken, so I asked if they could substitute tofu, and again they said yes! Hubby had plain iced tea for his diet, and I had Thai iced tea. YUM! The waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable (probably the owner) and chatted with us at length multiple times during our visit. I grabbed a menu on the way out the door. We told her we'd be back again soon, and we MEANT IT! Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent crab rangoons!  Just happened across this new place accidentally, and what a find!  Friendly service and yummy food.   Nice to see a good Thai fast food place around here!"}
{"text":"Pineapple shrimp curry, red curry chicken, and the coconut chicken fingers! ALL AMAZING. Our new favorite Thai place. Staff are extremely friendly and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Found this little gem while looking for a different restaurant.    Server was very friendly and the food arrived quickly.   Pad Thai was amazing. I cannot wait to come back and try something else !"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and when I was inkling for Thai I looked in Grub Hub and this place was listed. I have seen the restaurant when I go in their shopping plaza so I gave it a go. I have been ordering GH once a week for Thai and have ordered Tom Yum and Pad Thai. This has been my least likable one in Arizona.  The soup is overpriced for a small, no broth, and has a strong fish sauce odor. The Pad Thai was good except too much lime."}
{"text":"First time customers and the massamum chicken curry I commanded by our server was delicious! Perfect spice level and perfect portion Thai prawn coco or coconut shrimp really good!  Thom Ka (soup we stopped here for) made with all fresh ingredients! Best Thai iced tea and looking forward to trying their fried banana and Ice cream dessert  **plus*** they have picture menu!!"}
{"text":"Recently opened new Thai restaurant. It was incredible with great light recipes and wonderful customer service. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and did not disappoint.  Fresh shrimp rolls were delish!  Penang curry was really good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The pumpkin curry is amazing!  Great flavors and very friendly service. My husband and I tried going here because it was close to the movie theater, and this is definitely going to become a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"Delicious food and the staff were very personable & friendly. The red curry was so good."}
{"text":"Ordered out for lunch. We did the lunch specials, compared to other Thai locations I feel like it was a way smaller portion then what you would normally get. I paid $11 for a lunch and wasn't super impressed. Probably won't be back but food was ok."}
{"text":"Wonderful food & a very sweet staff! Everything we ordered was great! Looking forward to coming back"}
{"text":"You can tell the owner really loves this business  It's very personal. The owner is so sweet and funny. They make so many wonderful dishes here with a great presentation so you know what your getting.  The food is great! The taste the flavor the quality.  Please visit  Please taste  Please return  I know I will"}
{"text":"Took my kids for the first time to try Thai and they loved it. My ultimate favorite is Pad Thai and it was delicious. We also got the spring rolls which was so delicious. I was already stuffed but my daughter wanted to try the mango desert comes with sweet rice first time trying it and loved it. I highly recommend this restaurant especially we were greeted with so much smile and great energy."}
{"text":"I had the yellow curry chicken lunch and it was the best curry ever!! This is my new fave place!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the owner of this Thai place. She is so nice and helpful. Their summer rolls are delicious along with the homemade peanut sauce!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, lots of love in their food. Pad Thai was fresh and light. Definitely the new Thai spot. The Thai tea is made in house and is stronger than most and not too sweet! Will be stopping by next time we're out in the area! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and the service and food wonderful. Had the Tom Yum Soup and it was delicious got the large bowl couldn't finish but you best believe I took it home."}
{"text":"Tried Tom tuk soup, was on point , piping hot, server was great. My kinda shop to support. Looks like family working business. Worth the investment!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place. It was a great experience from the beginning. I had to call to find the location and the lady was super friendly on the phone and when we arrived it was even better! The owner is very nice and personable! I would recommend this to restaurant to everyone!"}
