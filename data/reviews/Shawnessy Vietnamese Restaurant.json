{"text":"Ate here 3 times in the past few months. Food has been average and the service/communication has been absolutely terrible.  Last two times we have ordered we have ended up with something completely different then what we had asked for.  I ordered an item and got no rice, even though the menu item specifically said it was served on a bed of steamed rice. When i asked the waiter he muttered they were out of rice and then quickly left.  My friend ordered seafood on shanghai noodles, and she got seafood, vegi's... no shanghai noodles. wow.  Needless to say I think we are done with this place."}
{"text":"Don't eat here! Go to the CHRA website to see how many health code violations it has, including vermin! Run away."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place but never took the time to do it but when  finally one day I had the time went there I had the  vermicelli with the salad rolls shrimp and pork the salad rolls had no taste at all the meat in the vermicelli had no taste just plain how ever the fish sause was ok  they are a lot cheaper then a lot of Vietnamese restaurant's but you get what you pay for don't know if I'll be back"}
{"text":"Please avoid this place. It used to be my family's \"go-to\" place for a quick meal, but everything seemed to go downhill in the last few years, or I'm just noticing it.  I came here with my parents. My father ordered a rice dish, the rice was still raw. When we told the server, he smiled at us, mumbled something, and walked away. None of us knew what he said. I ordered the rare beef pho. My beef did not look like beef. It was a pale pinkish grey. At least I didn't get sick. My mother ordered a stir-fry egg noodle dish. Near the bottom of the dish she started finding some translucent, jelly-like clumps everywhere. It turns out that the chefs threw in the corn starch and stirred it around to make the \"sauce\" and most of it didn't get absorbed. Gross.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place millions of times, and finally decided to have lunch here today with my mom. The man, who I believe is the owner, did not say a word to us when we walked in. He just pointed at a table, dropped the menus and left. Like other reviews stated, service is slooooow. It took forever for anyone to take our order even though the man walked past our table several times. We each ordered the lunch special, which came with a choice of spring rolls or salad rolls. The spring rolls were literally as thin as my pinky finger and were also quite greasy. The salad rolls were soggy and ripping (perhaps rice paper soaked too long?). They also had maybe one tiny piece of shrimp in them. Our food came in a good time frame, but they literally dropped it at the table and left without saying a word. Nobody came by the entire time we were eating either to see how everything was. The broth for the pho was blaaaand. I had to put tons of hot sauce in it to get any flavor and the beef in it was highly questionable. It was a weird grey color and was incredibly tough. My mom had beef vermicelli over noodles with spring rolls. She too found her meal bland and she had to douse it in hoisin sauce for any flavor to appear.   The most service we received was when we were paying. Funny how the man suddenly got friendly when he was taking our money. Couldn't have cared less about us beforehand. Oh well, I tried it and I really don't think I will return. I've had way better Vietnamese food, that's for sure."}
{"text":"The food was decent-tasting, but the service was less than satisfactory.  We walk in and the guy on his cellphone seats us in the worst seat, although the restaurant was empty. We chose to sit elsewhere, and he was okay with it, but let us show ourselves to the seat. It seems he was seating people add close to the kitchen as possible due to laziness! He delivered our food with no smiles nor even a word.  The Vietnamese spring rolls contained exactly one shrimp, sliced into for thin slices. Decent flavour, though. Beef noodle soup was a bit heavy on the MSG, though.  I would only recommend this place to the really hungry."}
{"text":"Food has always been fast and delicious. Service is always great even though it can be very busy at times. Try the chicken wings yum yum."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic, it had great food and but the service was a bit slow but it was very busy that night. I would love to come here again!"}
{"text":"This place is weird... We walk in, get a table then the \"waiter\" that was sitting across from us texting on his phone just gets up walks over and says what do you want? It felt SUPER rushed and the food was tasteless and just overall gross. We both were sick for a day after that.  Sure it was cheap but I rather pay a few extra $$ and get real good Vietnamese.  When asked what beer they had, he said \"Only Coors\" yes in a Vietnamese restaurant. We'll never go back since it was awful food and rush service."}
{"text":"My friends think it is really good. I think they may have sniffed glue. Perhaps they have never had really tasty food. Ever.   They food is bland, and luke warm at best. And inconsistent results, sometimes it has not been half-bad, but most times it is dismal.   Do yourself a favour and drive 5 minutes up the road to McLeod & Canyon Meadows and go to Sunshine Vietnamese. 10 gazillion times better and the service is always super friendly."}
{"text":"Why my friends always insist on going to this place, I'll never understand.  \"Ange! We gotta give it a chance! Maybe it'll be better\"  10+ visits later it hasn't gotten better. Service is still shaky and inconsistent and the communication lines are distorted. Good luck trying to order a simple plate of lettuce.  The food. The lukewarm soup is not very good, and trying it on a cold winter day is like trying to clean your wound with a wet kitchen dishrag. I also made a mistake of ordering their avocado shake a few times which came out a grey goop. There is a reason why a shade of green is called AVOCADO green. I will give them a few points for having decent Vietnamese subs and sub-par spring rolls.  I think I remember why we keep going back to this place. It's because of my friends' odd observation and insinuation that the manager, who wears funky silk shirts and has commanding leadership over his staff, is more than what he appears."}
{"text":"Salad rolls = average at best .  Vietnamese Chicken dish = mystery Chicken that tasted like it was mass produced in a laboratory . Gross  Beef noodle Pho = 3/10. No big deal. Edible but not delicious  Underbite server was average ."}
{"text":"Food is better or equal to any other Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary.   Service was fast and the waiter was pleasant enough.  Decent atmosphere for your average Vietnamese place."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place a lot over the years...seems like there was a different man running the show at the front of the restaurant this time?  Food is decent but they got a star deducted right away when they said they have no basil with the Pho.  I don't understand this.  It's like going to your favourite burger joint and they tell you they don't have any ketchup today.  Whack.   3 stars."}
{"text":"My recent craving for Sushi isn't that hard for me to believe. The same thing happened a couple of years back with Vietnamese food. Once I tried it I was hooked and I set out to sample all the locations nearest to me. Shawnessey Vietnamese is one of those locations that I've always been fairly satisfied with. The food is solid, it's fairly priced, and the service is usually good. It may not be my favorite place, but it's convenient and not a bad choice if you're looking. 20/30"}
{"text":"Let me start my review of this place buy saying That it would get a  very easily get a 1 IF the food was any less than \"pretty decent\" the service at this establishment is really not good at all ( a lot of the time) i could tell you a few stories about the service here! like the time my Dad was sitting at a table for 40 minutes and not even one server came to take his order! and this place is a small joint so there is no way you could just not notice a customer ! So he literally stormed out and never ever will go back !   My friends and I have had such a relationship with this place, the food can be really quite good or not so good, sometimes it taste fine but you can tell next to no effort or care was put into it(i know that sounds weird) other times its actually on par with any other average vietnamese place! not very consistent! buts thats just how I feel, either way i just go here when I am too lazy to go anywhere else (as this place is in an area that I visit often with virtually no better choices to dine at a lower pricepoint) Its not a great place thats for sure! average at its best, not good at its worst.  The service for me (because sometimes its jaw droppingly bad) is really the kicker for me! it is sort of one those places I am indifferent to because of that."}
{"text":"Affectionately known as the Pervert's Lair, this Vietnamese restaurant is handy merely for its proximity to the movie theaters, the Starbucks, and our place. Their dinner special vermicelli dish (with skewers of pork, chicken, beef, and ground shrimp wrapped around a sugar cane) is usually tasty, if a little steep at $14, and their vermicelli in general is a good dose of Vietnamese food when you're craving it. However, the service is often shoddy, and the owner is truly unpleasant, always prickly and aloof. A classic example of convenience over quality."}
{"text":"I know, I know ... Health code violations, rodents, etc. etc.  ... but I can't help making a visit to \"Greenie V's\" every now and then.  At $4.75 the subs are likely the cheapest in the city and, well, ya kinda get what you pay for. Not the highest quality, to be sure, but able to \"fill a void\" at that price.   The sub I had this afternoon was the strangest yet. It tasted like the cucumber was soaked in sugar water! Weird!  ... I'm not really selling you on this place, am I?  The pho I've had (when I feel \"classy\" enough to be seated and served) is also not that bad! Not the best, but again, not the worst."}
