{"text":"Thai Express--every McGill ghetto dweller's favourite fast food spot! Now, I love their pad thai. Its 'magically delicious' if not at all authentic (all the staff are Chinese, no Thai guys that's for sure). The staff here know the drill: order, wait, receive your food with a grunt. I always order the chicken pad thai and then load it up--as everyone does--with that delicious 'red rooster' sauce and a mountain of peanuts. Its Asian comfort food at its finest. I went here OFTEN and then, however, I read an article in Globe and Mail that the pad thai here is ridiculously fattening. Like over 1,200 calores fattening. I mean, I guess it makes sense considering the portions are mountainous and the use of what appears to be oil is more than generous but still it ruined it for me. I always thought 'oh Thai express if a healthy fast good option!' but I was WRONG, wrong I tell you. And now I wonder why I gained those freshmen 15 lbs! Ha! The truth is out. So if you want some cheap-ish and delicious Thai food on the go you now know where to go but remember its hella fattening and your ass won't be happy!"}
{"text":"Their pad thai was my food addiction during my McGill undergraduate years. The guys working here were all Chinese and found it hysterical that I would show up everyday and ask for the same thing.  Here's my order: 1 egg roll to start w/ the dumpling sauce. Chicken pad thai with extra chicken and broccoli added. Replace half the noodles with extra bean sprouts. Then I would add, i'm not kidding, about 10 tablespoons of crushed peanuts and probably a 15 second blast of Sriracha rooster sauce. Mix it all up and enjoy. Tell me that's not the best thing you've had in a long time. Don't forget to use chopsticks.  The nutritional content of the description above averaged out to about 2000 calories. Serious pad thai sweats. And all for less than $10. Look out."}
{"text":"Yep, the portion just got larger, and the taste is always that good (for a fast food restaurant).  It would be even better if they actually open their Sushi Shop menu."}
{"text":"There's always someone working on the side preparing things, but my boyfriend and I still waited at least 5min before anyone who had the intention of serving a customer came out. This wasn't that bad, as it was our first time so we took our time deciding what to try first. But when the employee came out, he looked directly past my boyfriend and I standing in front of the cash register and began taking the order of the Asian man beside us who had just walked in.   I'm seeing a sad and scary trend of racist Asians in this city, it's bad enough being treated like a peasant from québécois who resent speaking English. It may not be as easy to communicate in English as it is whatever other language you speak, but having a discriminatory attitude in public is just as damaging to society as it is to your reputation so please keep that in mind.   Won't be returning :) wouldn't trust these people with my food."}
{"text":"I have to say that this Thai Expr has considerably bigger portion than others! But like all other TEs the pad Thai's too greasy..."}
{"text":"Delicious and quick!    The service was friendly.   The menu is only in French but the friendly cashier was happy to translate to English.  I love the Tom yum soup.  A little spicy but not too hot    I also got three pad see ew.     Delicious."}
{"text":"Tasted the pad see ew one time. It costed me around 10 bucks and It was the most terrible pad see ew I have ever had. I do not recommend it to anyone. I couldn't even eat 1/5 of it."}
{"text":"Very nice food but what makes it special is the really nice staff. The staff are one of the nicest places i visited in mtl."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while exploring the city. I had two different kinds of rolls (emperors roll and dragon roll) as well as some salmon sushi pieces. Although my meal was made to order, nothing looked or tasted fresh, there was too much pepper, and the soy sauce container was too large (Pre-packaged, diluting the wasabi too much). Lastly, even though I was dining in, the served my meal in a to-go container. Very tacky. I'd recommend going elsewhere for lunch. Don't even think about dinner."}
{"text":"We all know Thai Express isn't authentic, but who says it can't be good? As a student I'm always looking for something that's cheap, fast, and hearty in portion size, so I was thrilled when I finally visited Thai Express. I'm American and I've been on the search for a place similar to Panda Express that sells Americanized Asian food in Canada, and Thai Express is honestly the next best thing. I can't speak for all their other dishes but the tofu pad Thai is DELICIOUS. I always order it extra spicy without bean sprouts and drown it in Sriracha and crushed peanuts; I know it doesn't sound the most appetizing but if you're a spicy food lover like myself TRY IT!!"}
