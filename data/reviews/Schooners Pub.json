{"text":"You know, I was prepared for a place loud, grungy maybe, and where I may not want to be for a few hours ... but I was pleasantly mis-informed.
A Friday night in Calgary and this strip mall pub was just the opposite; comfy, nice relaxed clientele, pleasant, funny wait staff.
Food was good; baked spaghetti was recommended by one of our party. The meatloaf was also worth while.
Drinks are relatively cheap, the evening was fun, and I recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Schooners use to be a great place for drinks and food; however, the food quality has unfortunately dropped too far.  It's sad, but I hope that might change soon!  The hot turkey sandwich made with real instead of processed turkey was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and good atmosphere. The best wings in town and they serve breakfast. This is one of Calgary's hidden gems."}
{"text":"Pretty good food , fast service !
Was not a huge fan of the black and blue burger but im sure the rest of the menu is good !"}
{"text":"The way a pub should be! Yeah it's a little run down but the food and service are top notch! Ice cold beer without all the craft beer gasrto non sense... Cold beer and Good service wish more places were like this"}
{"text":"The food was a meh at best ( deserves 2.5 starts) but it's getting a 1 because the delivery guy just dropped the food on the front porch and walked away. That shows a total lack of respect for the customers safety"}
{"text":"Formerly very smokey! Food is all deep fried pub grub. Drinks are good value and lots of VLT's for those that are into a little gaming action. A popular haunt for many locals here in the West Hills area of Calgary."}
{"text":"Walking in you'd think it's just an ordinary neighbourhood pub. It has the VLTs, the pool tables,  overly loud music on Saturday night. The  first hint that things are not as they seem are the more than competent waitresses. But it's not until the food arrives that you realize you're in the presence of greatness. 

The food is not consistently good, it's consistently great. Our latest order was the nachos (extra gauchomole & chicken), and the cook did not skimp on the hot peppers or cheese. This and previous experiences makes me want to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Beers are ice cold, the way they should be, wing nights are on a Tuesday; I now write this at 4am stuck on the toilet with the trots"}
{"text":"This is vintage strip mall pub. Vlts, carpet, curved back chairs, pool tables and a very sad looking dart board. Service was excellent. Food was ok...cougar ridge pricing."}
{"text":"I love this bar!At first glance, this little pub tucked into a corner of a strip mall looks like a dive, but wait!! Once you enter, it still looks a bit divey, lol. The atmosphere is not what is so great about this place. The food, the beer and the servers are what make it great. 
Now remember, it's just a small neighbourhood pub. They don't have an exotic menu or 80 million beer choices, but if you order a pint of beer, it will ALWAYS be fresh and very cold in a frosted mug. Mmmm mmm. 
The food is consistently delicious. It's regular pub fare and it's all very tasty. I personally love the mini Yorkshires and the potato skins. They also serve breakfast on weekends and it's a really good breaky. Cures my hangover every time  the prices are really reasonable too. 
The servers are mostly fantastic gals who are happy to serve you. Every once in a while you get \"the new girl\" or the one who is having a bad day (I assume), but even then, they know their stuff and do a good job. 
Schooners is a great place to stop in for a pint and a bite to eat. Just remember - it's just a local pub, not a fancy bar. It's for the \"every man\" (and woman)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer.  The waitress was a little stand offish. I think she is used to dealing with locals or the usual crowd.  I really liked the feel of the place, kinda dark, but not too dark.  Some games and things for entertainment.   TVs everywhere.  
The prices aren't bad.  Picked up a beer and some poutine.  The poutine was awesome.  I will be back jsut for this.  The Yorkies were pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  We were there at a weird time, so the food might not have been a good sampling.

Thanks for the brews!!"}
