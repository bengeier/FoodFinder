{"text":"This is by far my favorite spot to hang out in Urbana. I'm SO happy that they opened in Urbana, because even though Champaign isn't far from my house, it's really nice to have such a cool spot so close to home. I'm in the process of studying for a major board exam, so I love coming to Bar M and getting a beer and studying in this environment in the early evening. The atmosphere is super chill and comforting. I love that they have the option of sitting at a table as well as the comfortable chairs. The staff is seriously top notch. Friendly, knowledgable, and they always remember me and my husband when we come in and ask how we're doing. Their decor is more in line with a cool Chicago spot than a bar in the middle of Urbana. The beer is always fresh, and they have realllllly good happy hour deals. All in all, I give them an A+++!  Kate"}
{"text":"I went for their pre-grand opening wine tasting and had a pretty great time. Got to try a selection of four different Italian wines for free and then ended up buying a few glasses. Talked to who I think is going to be the head hancho of this place and she was extremely friendly and seemed to know a lot about wine. She was also very helpful, which has been a reported problem with the staff at this building's other establishments.  I'll be paying close attention to this place in the future and I'm extremely excited for it to open. I think it'll be a great addition to downtown Urbana."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place has some of the most INCOMPETENT EMPLOYEES I'VE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH IN MY LIFE. First of all, you should definitely call ahead to see if they have any wine or cheese available because BOTH WERE NOT IN STOCK WHEN WE WENT THERE. How hard is it to stock wine when you are a WINE BAR THAT SERVES LESS THAN 20 WINES. And the waiters could actually double as monkeys because they are incapable of taking an order correctly. The waitress we dealt with had the audacity to say that a poster offering special deals that the bar had was \"JUST A POSTER.\" Never in my life have I dealt with a bigger idiot. All she did was lie, false advertise, and not have the proper ingredients to make a pizza. By the way, all they do is serve PIZZA!!! Don't you think you would have cheese to make pizza? Honestly, some of the biggest idiots and sorry excuses for human beings I have ever dealt with. This place needs to be shut down and no one should even remotely think about eating or celebrating anything here."}
{"text":"9 ounces of amazing wine for $12! Their wine flight was Italian tonight, the same as their free wine tasting. I got to choose my three favorite wines from the tasting and make a flight. So cool. The vibe at Bar M is chill. Music is good too."}
{"text":"Bar M is accessed through Pizza M/ Flying Machine Coffee. Walk through the hallway with the restrooms and you'll find yourself in a spacious, modern, bar.   The wine selection was interesting and there is enough variety to keep beer drinkers happy. There are many tables to accommodate groups of all sizes and there is a lounge area with modern furnishings that can accommodate 6 people.   The space has a bit of an identity crisis; the amount of tables and the bright lights makes it seem like a cafeteria, but the graffiti that covers the wall make it really interesting and cool. There are a lot of different light fixtures; some are elegant, while some are Ikea style paper lanterns that you may find in a dorm room.   Though the layout doesn't make sense to me, it fits right in with the Pizza/Coffee shop concept (that I still don't quite get). Its a nice addition to Urbana and I would return, especially for the happy hour specials (5-7 pm)."}
{"text":"I finally got to come in for flight night last Friday. It was $15 for 3 glasses of wine! At first I thought it was just going to be smaller pours but nope, these were the real deal FULL pours of wine! We also ordered the scotch egg which was AMAZING. I think this is the best scotch egg I've ever had and definitely the best one in town! We also ordered a cheese board. I meant to get the meat and cheese board but the girl asked me if I wanted the half size which I went with, turns out the half size is just cheese. Really great cheese though! Lots of crazy things that I can't identify...one had fruit in it, another one was all black and marbled....Great place to chill and hang out. We also stopped in last Thursday for free wine tasting which they do from time to time and Metropolis was playing on tv....so cool!"}
{"text":"I like Bar M a lot! They have trivia sometimes and I've been to many events in the back. A great space and an entry way into the alley if you want to chill outside or casually graze into Sip Yard.   Great wine and beer selection and they have awesome cheeses/sausage to try from. I heard they make their own cured meats?! Either way, from what I've tried, it's been delicious (along with their pizzas but that's the Pizza M side of the building). I like the atmosphere and it can be a very cozy place to have some friends get together or to host an event."}
