{"text":"The Big Mary is amazing. The chicken is so moist and full of flavour and served on a really soft and tasty sesame seed bun. They have a Monday special for $3.99 on Big Mary sandwiches. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Pass by this place pretty often so decided to give it a try. Came here on a Monday so I got their big Mary sandwich special. $3.99 big Mary sandwich only every Mondays. Chicken was quite juicy but other than it was a pretty regular chicken sandwich. Taters were more like potato wedges but it was breaded and fried differently which made the tastes really unique and it was pretty delicious. Prices are fairly cheap and they have a value menu with about 8 items all prices $1.99."}
{"text":"If you like fast-food chicken, this is a nice alternative to the competitor.  The \"Taters\" are delicious but they have regular french fries if you prefer them.  Generally the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"2 piece meal. $8. Great service. Only problem was that it seemed as though the fries had been sitting and they simply reheated them in the fryer... they were very oily. The chicken was great and the breading on both the chicken and the taters is amazing. It is located in a small plaza however parking is usually available."}
{"text":"We come here fairly regularly now - the service has gotten better. Some of the staff has changed and the staff behind the counter are much nicer! 

I usually get the caesar wrap with taters and gravy - always a good combo but they really need to start drying off the lettuce before they put it in the wrap because often, the wrap is soggy and dripping from the bottom. Not as bad lately though. We also always add on a chicken pop-ins. They're SOOOO damned good, you can't NOT have the whole container of these. If I dont' get the wrap, i get these and these have slowly taken over as my new favourite. 

Worth a stop by, nice fresh chicken and taters and a nice change from typical KFC."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to a Mary Browns chain for a while now. Every time we visit Canada, we'd always had a reason why we couldn't go and would say next time. Well, we finally went. Daughter and I ordered a 2 piece deal. Hubs didn't partake because he's on Lent. We both ordered 2 piece chicken with fries and poutine as well. I was underwhelmed with the chicken and fries. The chicken wasn't hot nor crispy and the fries were actually potato wedges. I guess that's why they called them taters. Hubs liked the potato wedges and poutines, though. Service was very friendly and that's why I'm giving this place 3 stars. I'm glad I got to try Mary Browns but I don't think I'll be returning"}
