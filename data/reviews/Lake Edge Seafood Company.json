{"text":"The deli opened today and the restaurant will follow on January 10. I bought a pound of fresh mahi mahi, it was fantastic blackened on the stove. Super stoked about what these fellas are offering! Will be a regular customer.  Update: Have purchased scallops to cook at home on two occasions... so great! Not cheap at $30/lb but you're paying for fresh quality.  Apparently they'll begin serving brunch in early February- I look forward to giving that a go, too."}
{"text":"I love seafood so when friends suggested we try it out I was ready!  We just came off a Caribbean cruise so we had lots of comparisons !  They are doing things right here!  All four of us loves our meals.  Po'boy sandwich, seafood chowder, fish tacos, fish cakes, calamari, great.  staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Atmosphere feels like a fish restaurant, and very clean. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Like others, I want to support a new, local business, but no. I had the shrimp po' boy with sides and a water. I want to say it was nearly $15. The sandwich had three mediocre sized shrimp and just pretty much lacked in substance and flavor. For that price, I was expecting something with a little more heft that would satisfy. It did not. The vinegar slaw was unimaginative.   Everyone was nice, but that doesn't make up for the sorry size of the sandwich relative to the price point. There was nothing in my experience that would make me want to return, bring friends/family, or refer others. A disappointment to say the least. Tempest has better prices, food, and portions and Tempest is high-end fine dining!   I've been to seafood places where prices are similar, but portions are generous. If you want a business tip, bulk up servings or drop prices... otherwise y'all won't last too long. Too many other places to buy fresh seafood in town, where you don't feel like you've been robbed."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The staff gave great recommendations for what to eat. Highly recommend the cod sandwich, fish tacos and clam chowder. We look forwarded to trying more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I got great service and a nummy piece of salmon, just the right size for one. It was so much better than any salmon I have had in the past year. This is my go to place for seafood now and I look forward to visiting it every week!"}
{"text":"Brunch was great!!!  But Only on Sundays. Regular menu M-S. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I really want Lake Edge Seafood to succeed. Since the announcement of their opening, I've watched their online reviews with mixed results, and finally decided to give them a try yesterday (February 2018) for lunch with a friend, figuring they had (hopefully) worked the bugs out of their service.   The decor is tastefully nautical and the location is great. Upon walking up to the ordering area, we were greeted by a gentleman (owner? chef?) who asked us if we had any questions about the menu. My friend asked whether the Shrimp Skewer ($13.95) was grilled or fried. He was told he could order it either way.   Upon ordering, about 60 seconds later, he was told by the counter person that the shrimp could only be fried. Apparently, the employee didn't know that grilling was an option. When pressed, the other folks behind the counter corrected him. So much for having the \"bugs\" worked out.  This place is expensive. Big City expensive. NYC expensive. Not really the sort of lunch prices one would expect to find on Madison's east side. The Shrimp Skewer, at $13.95, consists of four (4) modest-sized (26/30) shrimp, on a few greens, drizzled with sauce, no sides. I had the fish tacos with tilapia; (3) flour tortillas filled with fried tilapia topped with pickled onion and a mango chutney. Substituting a bowl of clam chowder in place of a side, plus a soft drink, my meal clocked in at $21.00 sans gratuity. Food was good, but not worth these prices.   When greeted by an employee asking us how we were enjoying our meal, my friend - an exceptionally gracious human being - very quietly and tactfully expressed his concern over the price of his four shrimp. The female employee appeared somewhat confused, shrugged her shoulders, said nothing, and walked away.   That pretty much sums up our experience - at least with dining in - at Lake Edge Seafood. We, too, shrugged our shoulders and walked away.   I will return to check out their fresh seafood counter offerings, which looked wonderful, at some point in the future, as I am hoping it serves as a nice alternative to driving to Empire or St. Pauls in Milwaukee for fresh seafood. But as far as Lake Edge's in-house dining goes, don't expect to be \"wowed.\" Take a big wallet, or you will leave hungry and unimpressed."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood and amazing casual restaurant with counter service and ample seating. Mostly fish, but some non-fish options. Lobster roll, lobster Mac-and-cheese, and all soups are excellent choices. All items our table ordered were with going back for more.   Wow! Are they busy on Friday night. Fish fry is popular!"}
{"text":"Visit some clients in Madison and thought I would try out this new place. First off lunch was like $35.00 for one person.. I ordered the shrimp tacos and I wish I would have taken a picture of them cause it was a lonely plate of thee large flour tortillas and EXACTLY 2 FRIED shrimps in each taco - please let people know they are FRIED and not grilled - I was totally expecting fresh big fat grilled shrimp instead I got 2 small fried shrimps in 3 tacos - if you do that please save the last flour tortillas and put three large shrimps in each - don't be skimpy that sucks!   I got a side with it and I picked the New England Seafood Chower! Ok this should be called tomato and potato soup!  I did NOT taste a hint of seafood and if there was it was BURIED in the tomatoes and Potatoes which there was way too much of!   Finally I ordered some oysters to try cause I LOVE raw oysters - as soon as I ate them I had regrets - first off they were slimy and oysters are NOT suppose to be slimy  I thought to myself ok is this strange! And since I was in a restaurant that said Fresh Seafood this was not possible don't they sample there product to ensure it's safe and fresh? I'm crossing my fingers I don't get horridly sick tomorrow!   Finally the people were nice they checked on me but I knowing I was at a restaurant called Fresh Seafood did not have the balls to tell them their food SUCKED and was NOT fresh as promised!  So beware if you venture here!"}
{"text":"Give them a month.  Tried to buy some salmon.  The guy couldn't work the register.  Some folks came in to buy lunch and the prepared food area wasn't open yet at 12 pm even though it is supposed to open at 11 am.  Prices are high."}
{"text":"My husband and I met here for dinner a bit later in the evening- around 7 Friday night. Like the last time I had come in- earlier in the week to pick up carry out salads- the owners of the restaurant were out on the floor ready with a warm greeting.   Although you order at the counter and your food is delivered to the table, the restaurant is a step above casual with tasteful nautical themed decor. On my previous visit the owners told me the line sometimes gets long on busy nights but it goes pretty quickly and you can order a drink while waiting. We must have missed the dinner rush because there was no one in line and plenty of available seating.   I don't care for fish fries typically because they are usually too greasy, but I had seen a plate of fish tacos being served on my previous visit and the fish Iooked amazing. So we both ordered the cod fish fry (choice of 2 or 3 pieces - we got 2) and did not regret it. The cod pieces were large, thick and perfectly flaky, the breading nicely browned and not greasy. With the fish fry you get a choice of two sides and I chose fries and vinegar coleslaw. My husband had the same with mayo slaw instead. Fries are another menu item that I usually find disappointing, but these were the perfect amount of crispness for me. The coleslaw was fresh and refreshing with the fried food.   The restaurant staff was attentive and our waiter and at least two other employees checked on us several times. Everything about our visit was great and we will definitely be back, both to buy something at the counter to cook at home and to try the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great selection.  I loved how the place looked, too! I can't wait to go back and try restaurant,  when opens!"}
{"text":"We've been there a few times for fresh seafood and a few times for dinner. The seafood is FRESH and the dinners we've tried have all been delicious. Everyone there has been helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Lunch at Lake Edge was outstanding.  My wife and I both had the Shrimp Po' Boy and split a dozen Blue Points on the half-shell.  DELICIOUS!  Great fresh food and beautiful, nautical motif.  A great addition to the East-side.  You need to try it!"}
{"text":"Very good food, friendly service and reasonable prices. I'll be back! We had the seafood cake benedict and thought it was wonderful. The mimosas were great too! The owner came out and gave us free cake at the end of our meal because they were closing for the afternoon."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I wasn't hungrier when I came to eat here. Had the bacon wrapped scallops and salmon bisque. My very high maintenance friends were also very pleased. I tried the fish tacos and onion rings also tasty. Must come back. Staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Speaking of which, they just brought our table of six ppl three free desserts."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but came away disappointed.  The decor is nice, and the workers were friendly, even though I had my kids with me.  The young man at the register was polite but seemed a little confused about the menu, and needed help from others around him, but he kept at it and got our order right.  My kids were happy with the kids' meals, so maybe I should have gotten one of them.  I had the lobster mac and cheese, and it was a real disappointment -- really wrong in almost every way.   The few shreds of lobster on top were fried until they were tough and flavorless, and the breading tasted a bit burnt.  Lobster should never be cooked that hard, and I don't understand why it would be fried in this dish anyway.  Somehow, the cheese sauce had a smoky taste that was unpleasant and seemed unintentional.  The black pepper ground around the edges of the bowl and on top was excessive and excessively coarse, disrupting the taste, the appearance, and the texture.  The \"creamy\" slaw was dry and flavorless -- though the bag of chips was surprisingly good.  I tasted the kids' fries, and they weren't bad at all.  Maybe another dish would have been better, but judging from what I ate, and the price I paid, I was robbed.  (They get two stars because I was robbed politely.)"}
{"text":"Great fish boil. Tons of cod with the right amount of shrimp and potatoes. Plus a Cold cow, hard to beat...."}
{"text":"Yum!!!   Finally a GOOD seafood place in Madison!!  Don't be looking for cheap when you're talking quality seafood in the Midwest!  The calamari appetizer was delicious!  I had fresh scallops for $19 with two generous sides.  Cooked perfectly!  My companion had grilled walleye (not exactly sea food, but midwestern sea food) and it was fresh, cooked beautifully and tasted sweet and fresh.  If you love seafood and want fresh, not frozen, mushy sea food, this is the spot.  The calamari was almost as good as what we've gotten on the coast, except no salty sea air.  Their breading was spot on!  They're still working on a few items, but go before this becomes a hot-spot!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos were on point! Some of the best I've had in the Madison area. I look forward to coming back and exploring their offerings."}
{"text":"Very clean we had the fried shrimp with fresh fruit and yummy frys and lobster Mac and cheese with onion rings and fruit. Great portions. Food was delicious. Shrimp were huge. Lobster was great! Very customer service oriented."}
{"text":"First visit tonight.  Casual but upscale crab shack environment.  Staff very friendly but still working things out (both ours and the next table had minor food delivery timing  issues).  I thought the food a little bland, maybe a little high in price.  I wondered if I could identify the walleye perch, and cod blindfolded. Hot chips were great.  I will give it another go in a couple of weeks. They have a bigger menu than I expected and I anticipate a better experience once things are running smoothly."}
{"text":"5 people, 5 very different choices. Everyone enjoyed their meal and the ambience. The owner and all of the employees we interacted with were so nice and accommodating. Eyed up the fresh fish/scallops on the way out, beautiful. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for seafood! Scallops were cooked well! Awesome east coast atmosphere. Food came out really quick. You can also but fresh fish from their market inside the restaurant. I came in with a group of people and the owner was so sweet. Came to the table to see how things were and offered us a creme brûlée! Definitely will be back to try the rest of the fish!"}
{"text":"Finally a good seafood shop on the East Side!  Great quality seafood, including some hard-to-find items. The restaurant served excellent quality food with quick, friendly service. The Manhattan seafood chowder was amazing!!  For a casual seafood place (with some no -seafood items, too), this can't be beat."}
{"text":"This place is refreshing from the usual drab Monona dining establishments. It's clean, spacious and has a real fish market neighborhood feel to it. The owner is extremely friendly and answered my multiple menu questions with a smile and a handshake. I've been here for lunch a few times already since their opening. I've tried the lobster roll, calamari, and bacon wrapped scallops. All were delicious!  I just recently returned for dinner and had the grouper which was excellent as well. While I was dining I was offered 20% off anything in their fresh fish case which I gladly took advantage of! I brought home some beautiful king crab legs and the nicest/largest scallops I've ever seen in the Madison area. Do yourself a favor whether it's dining in or taking some fresh fish home to grill and stop in this place!"}
{"text":"We tried Lake Edge last weekend.  It was so good, we had to come again the next, weekend bringing our daughter and son-in-law with us.  You see the fresh take home fish counter before you get up to the back where you order your meal.  The fish are so beautiful, its hard to not just stop and stare.   The menu is on a board behind the counter, and at first glance, it appears to not be very large, but the more you look, the more you see.  I changed my mind several times before I settled on my order.  After you order, they will give you a number for your table, and bring the food out to you.  They have a selection of beer, wine and soft drinks.  The decor is a cute nautical theme.  Between the four of us we tried to Fish fry, Grouper, clam chowder, salmon bisque, Calamari Po'boy and oysters.  Everything was perfection.  I have to comment to oyster lovers in particular.  I have tried oysters at many locations around the mid-west, and Lake Edge is the first place I have actually found a briny oyster worthy of an ocean side restaurant.  If you like the brine, you HAVE to try them.  You can buy them singly or in a 1/2 or full dozen size.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! what a great menu- love the idea of being able to purchase fresh seafood and/or being able to order and dine at the restaurant with a delicious glass of wine or cold beer. Some of the most popular dishes are the fish tacos, cod fish fry, and lobster roll. We dined in the restaurant on  bacon wrapped scallops, extra large size, seafood cakes which were made of lump crab meat, yellow fin tuna, grouper, mahi mahi, swordfish, monk fish and scallops ....way better than an ordinary crab cake, beer batter cod  and shrimp skewers which were extremely flavorful and done to perfection. The creme brûlée was a perfect way to end our meal! They offer take out as well....what an exciting new place for delicious seafood!"}
{"text":"We tried it tonight for dinner with my brother and sister in law for the first time. Decor was nice and the staff and one of the owners were very nice.   My partner and I ordered the shrimp.  My in-laws ordered fish tacos and fried fish.  The shrimp were burned and rubbery.   They were not edible.   (The tacos and fish my in-laws had were very good.)  We told them about the shrimp, as I  could not eat them.  Instead of making it right,  they brought me a piece of cheesecake.   So I paid $17 for shrimp and instead had a piece of cheesecake and 2 sides for dinner.......that's an expensive piece of cheesecake!  Luckily my in-laws gave me a fish taco to eat.    On a side note,  and not that this is a bad thing, but the menu states that the fish and shrimp are battered, but instead they had a breaded texture.  The fish in my taco was good, it just wasn't what you expect when you read \"battered.\"  I'll give them one more try, as it would be great to have a good seafood restaurant near me.   Based on what they served me tonight,  however, I'm not holding my breath."}
{"text":"The Fish tacos and my soup were awesome. Great addition to the neighborhood! Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"No no no no no no no!!! No tomatoes and lettuce on a lobster roll!!!! Should have a buttery soft roll (not the hard roll served here) and just lobster with a little mayo, some salt and pepper, and of you're serving Rhode Island style, some hot melted butter. Nothing else!!!!!"}
{"text":"Freshest oysters I've had in a long time. Great variety on their brunch menu. First visit but will not be our last to this new restaurant."}
{"text":"Boy do I want this place to succeed. Great location, friendly owners. Great feel and a lots gone into the presentation of the place. I give 5 stars on looks. Food... oh boy. A little over $40 got us small portions that were flavorless and I was questioning if my Cod was actually cooked through as cool as it was. I ordered it blackened. The menu is also difficult because there are no descriptions. Additionally, the sides are not very good and extremely small portions. When I asked if I could forgo the sides for a soup I was told \"no\". Then I asked if I could just get the Cod and was told \"no\". All meals require you to get two sides. Plates were cold when we were served. Daughters side was not brought out and the lady that took our order decided she needed to verify the side really was supposed to come out. When it did I was shocked to see it delivered in a clear plastic bowl with cover, the kind you'd find in the frozen freezer section of a grocery store and throw in a microwave.  Fish tacos... on flour tortillas? Serious? Who does that? This place does that. Deep fried shrimp in the shrimp tacos? Totally expected grilled. Only one shrimp on each taco?! Not impressed.   Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Just driving by happen to see this place...and was so pleasantly surprised of everybody's friendly services...something different :D...highly recommend of their delicious food and friendly service ;D."}
{"text":"First time in for a quick lunch, I chose the seafood cakes. Delicate crunch on the outside and totally delicious creamy inside with just enough green pepper and onion to make the texture interesting. They were served a a bed of fresh greens that made it a light lunch. The two sauces added enough spice to round out the taste treat.  Update: I have been here twice since the above review and my rating has dropped. I went a second time with partner and her shrimp were dry and her cup of soup was half filled. We figured it might have been because they were super busy and running out of soup, but we should get a full cup and succulent shrimp for the price.  I went again today with bestie and ordered one of salads with the added fish cakes. I specifically asked how many it came with and she said two. Perfect. When they brought the food there was only one fish cake. I asked where the other one was and explained that the woman said there would be two. So they put in the order for one more. I waited 15 minutes for a burnt fish cake to show up.  I am glad to have the market, and will use it to purchase fish to cook at home, but I won't spend my time or money eating out there. Bummer."}
{"text":"Great fresh market. We have bought and prepared tuna, crab, lobster claws, a different Shark from here!!!! We have also been in a few times for the restaurant. Great fried fish. I love the batter they are using on the fish fries... Extra crispy. The oysters, onion rings, and clam chowder are great too! We will be back very soon. Happy to have such a unique eater/deli in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"What a great find in Madison. One of my new favorites. Great food, super service, and love the decor. You have to try the lobster roll!"}
{"text":"Revisited a few weeks later. Much better. But mostly we love going there for the fresh seafood. It's amazing. If you want to make a lovely seafood dinner at home this place is for you. See my picture of the greatly improved display case.  ***  will revisit at a later date. Food was good, but we had to wait for 30 minutes to order and another 50 minutes for the food. To be fair I didn't want to go because it was a Friday and I knew it would be nuts, but the kid wanted to try it. There were no greens because they had run out. Food was lukewarm when we finally got it home. Avoid Fridays at 5:30 pm. I am not a big eater, but judging by my portion I think they were running out of everything. Below is the fried walleye dinner at $16"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for Friday fish.  The fried cod was very good, as were the soups, coleslaw, and Mac and cheese.  Highly recommend, but this is not a full service restaurant, you order at the counter and they bring it out to your table."}
{"text":"I stopped in to check this place out and to buy some seafood. They had a nice variety of fish. They were out of quite a few items, which wasn't ideal, but it was later in the afternoon when I went. I bought some scallops which were fantastic! They were fresh and big and turned out great.   They do have a kitchen and serve food. I did not try anything this time, but plan to the next time I stop in. I am happy to have a seafood market in Monona will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. For east coast ex pats the food quality is on par with Legal Seafood. Everything was tasty. All 3 soups were delicious. The decor is great. I love open concept kitchens-nothing to hide Service was wonderful. My wife had the grilled grouper and she's used to having grilled grouper caught same day in the Florida Keys and said it was delicious. It's not cheap. It is too small for the crowd they have and could have. I had the fried combo platter which was tasty, but I'll go grilled next time. One of the top places in Monona and likely the top seafood in the Madison area."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the decor, mostly happy with the food, and pleased with the friendly staff.  Tried this place for lunch on a Friday. Go early, as it can get swamped fast!  This is NOT FAST FOOD, so don't expect cheap or fast.... But the seafood is fresh and delicious.  I had Shrimp Tacos, and chose veggies of the day for my side. I love that freshly cooked vegetables are even an option!  Kinda wished I had a choice of grilled or fried shrimp, he never asked. But I did enjoy the shrimp fried anyway.  Would have liked a bit more pizazz in the tacos, but they were good.  Hubby had the 2 piece fried cod with fries and veggies. We both thought the fries looked great, but had a minor after taste. Perhaps from sharing the cooking oil? Not sure. The cod was very good!  Lots of fresh seafood options in the cooler to take home. Prices seemed decent.  Nice place!"}
{"text":"I ordered for take out. The Smoked Salmon bisque was AMAZING. The perch and walleye were dry, way over cooked. The cod's batter was limp, under cooked. The onion rings were non descript, zero flavor. What really made me mad was when checking out, I had to check a 5%, 10%, or 15% gratuity. I ordered take out, why would you expect a gratuity for that? Besides all that, for what the food actually was when I got it home, it was WAY over priced. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good seafood. We had the owner come and talk to us and check to see how we enjoyed dinner. Great atmosphere and they are really working hard to make it in a competitive Madison food scene. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Friendly service and tasty food!  The caesar salad with seafood cakes on top was delicious.  The greens were fresh, salad dressed perfectly, and the seafood cakes were wonderfully fresh and nicely cooked. You could really taste the quality of their food. Husband had the shrimp po boy and enjoyed it.  For the quality of the food and care in preparation, prices quite reasonable ($13-15 for an entree).  Sides are amazing.  Lovely beer selection."}
{"text":"First visit tonight. Calamari appetizer. Good, but small portion for $12. Shared the combo plate fish fry. 1 small piece of cod, 1 medium piece of walleye, 2 slivers of perch, and 2 overly breaded shrimp. $19.99. Fish is flavorless. The hot chips side (which did not come out with the plate of fish) was the highlight of the plate.  They have you pay, and tip, ahead of time. All in all, small portions, big price. Not recommended."}
