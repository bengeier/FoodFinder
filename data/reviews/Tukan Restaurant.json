{"text":"Pupusas are amazing and the service is extremely friendly. I'm from that part of the world so I love the atmosphere...laid back and relaxing.  The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because as soccer fans that most of us Latinos are, we need bigger TV's to enjoy the games. Besides that, I highly recommend the place to get a real taste of food from down south."}
{"text":"Great service! Love the food feels like home! I love that have many options my son is picky eater. Only bad thing is horchata tastes water down. The owners are sweet every time we go."}
{"text":"PUPUSAS GALORE! They even offer shrimp papusas, which I have not seen other places. Delicious food and the papusas are priced average at $3. 3 papusas will fill you for under  $10. Just be mindful that cans of pop go for $2.50 and if you go on a hot summer day, don't expect to escape the heat, as their A/C comes from a window unit high up on the wall and it doesn't seem to offer any relief."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of great things about this restaurant so my girlfriend and I decided to finally try it out. It's a quaint little restaurant with delicious food and attentive staff. We're definitely coming back to try out a few other dishes."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service fun, friendly and helpful. The decor may need an upgrade but it reminded me of some Spanish restaurants we visited when driving through the US.. Don't let appearances turn you away! we will be back and are already telling our friends to go check it out."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars based on the fact that I already know and like Salvadoran food. If you are unsure, be prepared to start slow.  Go in for a snack of pupusas and a beverage.  See how you like them and then come back for a full lunch or dinner if you do.  Salvadoran entrees tend to be some kind of grilled meat or fish, a scoop of flavoured rice, a scoop of refried beans, and a little green salad - not incredibly saucy, fancy or spicy.  However,  there should be some red and green salsas on the table.  The red salsa is mild. The green is very hot. Also, there will be curtido, the pickled coleslaw that Steph mentions. The idea is to layer the hot pupusa with both the red sauce and the curtido.  The tucan is not fancy at all.  Central American satellite tv plays over the bar.  Service is very attentive and friendly.    The neighbourhood is classic Vanier: payday loans, massage parlours, head shops and lots of small restaurants with food from different cultures.  You might consider a visit to the giant bingo hall across the street afterwards :)  I liked it all very much but found the prices a little high.  ($15 entrees, pupusas around $3.00 each) But maybe it is because I am used to paying so little for the same food in El Salvador."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! It is a family run business and there is such a welcoming and warm vibe inside. The family is from El Salvador, and everything from their decor to their food is authentic. Some of the ingredients are imported from El Salvador itself and you can taste the authenticity in their food. They are famous for their pupusas, and I can see why. They are totally delicious! Try the Pupusa Revuelta ( pork and cheese) and Pupusa de Quezo ( cheese). For only $3, these  are a delicious appetizer, snack, or have a few for a meal!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Salvadorean food. Atmosphere is excellent and staff is so friendly. Maria will make you feel at home and explain anything you need on the menu"}
{"text":"Food was kind of cold-ish. Wasn't the best food I've had, though this was my first time eating this type of food. Service was good though."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and love the food.  I haven't tried their tex-mex food, but I observed a lot of people ordering it, so I assume it's good.  I opted for the El Salvadorean fare, as it's harder to find in this area.   I've ordered the carne asado, the chicken tamales, several types of pupusa (I recommend the cheese and loroco ones!), fried plantains, and their fried cassava.  Food is served with several types of homemade hot sauces as well as the standard Salvadorean curtido, or spicy fermented cabbage relish.  The lady who works there is wonderful and always super friendly to me.  I get a great positive feel from everyone there, which makes the place more than just business as usual.    The decor is very basic and utilitarian, more of a diner cafeteria-style than fancy restaurant, but it's always been clean and well-maintained, including the bathrooms located downstairs."}
{"text":"I tend to enjoy the odd \"hole in the wall\". Sure restaurants with ambiance are great if the food is decent and you're not shelling out a mortgage payment for a meal. This place is one of my favourites when I'm looking to enjoy authentic Salvadorian food. I don't go there to enjoy the artwork, or table linens...It's all about the food. I've never had a problem finding street parking, the restaurant is clean, and the owners are wonderful, the food is excellent and totally reasonable. Last time I was there, they didn't have a liquor license, but I wasn't there to enjoy booze anyway. I can't speak to menu items that are not traditionally Salvadorian, but the owner will make recommendations if you're looking to enjoy a cultural culinary experience. Hope you enjoy this hidden gem as I have...."}
{"text":"El Tucan is a sit-down, Salvadorian restaurant located in Vanier.  Their menu changed not too long ago, and they now offer Tex-Mex, Salvadorian and \"Canadian\" food. They offer a full bar and lots of non-alcoholic drink options.  The menu is diverse enough that it can accommodate vegetarians.    The Salvadorian food is great.  They offer the best pupusas in the city.  For those of you who have never tried a pupusas, they are a traditional dish consisting of corn tortillas with a meat, vegetable or dairy filling, that are pan fried.  They are typically served with curtido, a coleslaw with chilles and salsa.  Pupusas are about 3-4$ each and are quite filling!  They also offer pasteles Salvadorian style, fried plantains, tamales, and many Salvadorian deserts.  El Tucan has jumped on the poutine train and now offer yuca poutine, a Salvadorian spin on a Quebecois dish.  It's made with yuca, gravy and cheese.  Unfortunately, they use grated cheese which is a bit of a bummer.    I'm going to be frank here; I suspect El Tucan has expanded their menu in hopes to attract a larger clientèle.  I wouldn't go to a Salvadorian restaurant to have a club sandwich.  Ottawa already offers delicious cantina style Mexican food.  El Tucan should stick to Salvadorian dishes.  It's a Vanier gem that I suspect is being under appreciated."}
{"text":"OK - this is a hard one to review - I want to give them a 4 star, because I really enjoyed my lunch!   I'd do a 3.5 if Yelp would let me.  (Been a while since I said that.)  The woman who greeted and served us was wonderful - she was happy to explain what everything was, and what to think about ordering for Salvadorian food, and what goes with what.  She made us feel very welcome.  The food was simple and wonderful.  I enjoyed everything I tried - the fish tacos, the tamale, the thing that looked like a large perogie and the flat pupusas    (Yes, I should have paid more attention to the names, but I was having an in-depth conversation with a friend!)    The décor was aged, the tables and chairs simple.   Nothing glamorous or trendy - and yet, I did decide I liked it.  Fake stone flooring, simple furniture.  It suited the food in many ways.   If décor and trendiness matter more to you than anything else, don't go here.  So even though I've given them a 3 star (still a great rating) if you want to try Salvadorian food (not something you find a lot of in Ottawa - or anywhere I've lived), check them out.  Much of the food is good for sharing with friends.  (For example, the fish tacos come in 4s, so split that and some of the appetizers for a great meal.)  Now the really telling part of the review:  Would I return:  Yes.   I definitely will return.  Food was different, tasty and enjoyable and the waitress (likely the owner) was wonderful. Would I recommend:  Yes.  If we have out-of-town guests that like trying new foods we'll show up here.  Also, will direct co-workers here."}
{"text":"This is the second time my family has eaten at this lovely establishment. The atmosphere is extremely child friendly. Wonderful service from the waitress whom I'm assuming was also the owner.  The beans, rice and salad were mediocre - I wouldn't write home about them. The salad was over dressed and not exciting. Beans I'm assuming are from a can.  The chimichanga was fantastic. I had the beef chimichanga and expected ground beef - it was a nice quality pull apart beef. Nicely cooked. Cheese and peppers inside were also nice.  The pupusas were delicious. I liked that the toppings were served separately so you could dress them yourself. They brought them out one at a time so they were very fresh.   We also got two pitchers of tamarindo for the table which was delicious and felt very homey.  I will consider going again if we are in town. It was moderately expensive for the number of people we had with us."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and we were the only people in the restaurant. This is normally not a good sign, but thankfully in this case it was misleading.  We only ordered from the Salvadorean part of the menu and I will definitely be back for more. We got two dishes that I had tried before and so I am able to offer a comparison. Both the pupusa and the platano frito, were the best I had ever had, cooked perfectly with excellent flavour. The other dishes we got were pasteles and Yuca Con Chicharron. I have never had those before so I an only offer my impressions of the dish. The pasteles were fairly bland and doughy, a bit like a fried samosa without the spices. The Yuca Con Chicharron had fried yuca spears, pork and coleslaw. Sounds weird but together it was excellent. The pork is fried in such a way that it is very dry with zero moisture however I got the impression that it was meant to be like that and it worked with the overall dish.  The atmosphere was kind of latin american kitsch but it fit and they bring you containers of coleslaw and hot sauce to dress up your dishes. The waitress was incredibly nice and knowledgeable.   I certainly recommend a visit as it would be a shame to lose such a wonderful spot."}
{"text":"I am so glad we stopped off at this place during our trip to Ottawa. The neighbourhood is kind of sketchy, the restaurant is dated and needs some serious work. It's definitely one of those hole in the wall family run spots.    I promise the food is authentic and way better than it looks! We ordered cheese and lorocco ( vine buds) pupusas, chicken tamales along with some fried plantains and beans. Everything was fresh and tasted delicious! Make sure to try the horchata, we really enjoyed it. The service was really great too. The only thing I will say is that I found it a bit pricey. The tamales are small for the price. Overall, I suggest checking this place out. I really wanted to try a tex-mex meal but I stuffed myself with pupusas and tamales like a turkey on thanksgiving day!"}
{"text":"This review is based on our first-ever visit to Tukan Restaurant in early June 2018.    Overall, my wife and I were very happy with our visit and we will go back to dine there again sometime soon.  The venue itself is low-key, but reasonably comfortable and the staff are typically Latino: friendly and engaging.  The food was delicious -- and it tasted very much like home-made cuisine that you would taste if visiting a Latino family.  My wife (who is originally from Central America) had several pupusas (traditional Salvadorian patties made using corn dough stuffed with meat and cheese) served warm.  These pupusas were fresh, tasty and made just right -- and they were accompanied by the curtido (pickled cabbage) as well as a spice sauce.  I had the Chile Relleno dish -- which was super-filling.  Rice, black-bean paste, salad and a whole large pepper stuffed with minced-meat and covered in a very tasty sauce with cooked vegetables.  It was a very satisfying meal and the flavours blended very nicely -- nothing was over-powering and all parts of the dish were equally delicious.  If you want, you can add more hot-sauce to any part of your dish.    To drink, we had glasses of cold horchata: the typical beverage which uses ground rice as well as nuts and cinammon as flavour.    If you ignore the fact that this restaurant is located in a rather run-down area of Vanier, you are in for a treat: the prices are very reasonable and the authentic Salvadorian food tastes like it was made at home.  We recommend this place and we will be back there for dinner soon."}
