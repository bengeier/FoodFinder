{"text":"Good selection, like the \"create your own pizza\" they tend to go overboard on the cheese. Like the salads. Although not Italian -- as they claim."}
{"text":"This was our first time checking out CIA and didn't know what to expect. The place is massive and clean (which is a plus) and had a decent amount of customers for a Sunday evening. The pizza was actually pretty good! We got the Diavola with green olives instead of black and it packed the perfect amount of heat. The kids shared a cheese pizza and I would recommend asking for half the amount of cheese as it was a little too much. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So... This place is run by the same guys as FBI Pizza. 

I ordered what is the equivalent as everyone else size \"Large\", and had two generic toppings (Pepperoni and Anchovy). 26 bucks. Yikes. 

They market their place as gourmet etc.   Its not a wood burning stove FYI. 

The pizza itself was tolerable at best. I probably would have preferred to save the money and get Pizza Nova. Very far from gourmet. The crust was the best part. A nice dough overall. Toppings were very generic and they used the absolute worst type of mozzarella on it. The cheap type that kind of squeaks between your teeth and has the texture of chewing gum. 

This place is a hard pass for me."}
