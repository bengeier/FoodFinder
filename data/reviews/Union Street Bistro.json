{"text":"The best Sunday brunch (open 11-2 on Sun) in Concord including classics such as eggs Benedict or crabcake Benedict."}
{"text":"Service is sub par, but food is amazing. I would recommend the chicken, pork, risotto and bread!!"}
{"text":"Munchy Crunchy:   Place is like a cross between granola and an attempt at fine dining. Almost feel uneasy being in there. Our waitress was really nice though and she was attentive and helpful. It was a late lunch with four of us and one other person dining by herself so it may not a good indicator of service if it was crowded. It was national burger day according someone in our group so we all had the burger. My friend mentioned that they missed the tempature on his burger and mine was well well done which I didn't order that way either. Why ask for how you want it if you're going to cook and server it the way you want to anyway. Kudos to the waitress as she offered up a new one on the spot. Regardless, I didn't much care for the place and would rather go six or seven doors down to the Italian place for a 6.99 lunch which serves creative and tasty dishes."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for date night. Simply enjoyable. Our service was spot on. The wine is priced just right with a very diverse selection. Started off with fried green tomatoes that came out piping hot with a crawfish cream sauce. Also had a yummy sour creamy crab soup and Salmon for dinner.   Wife had a glass of Rodney Strong Cab with the wedge salad complete with bacon, tomato and bleu cheese. She followed with perfectly crispy crab cakes."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful expierence here today. It was Valentine's Day & we were looking forward to a nice date & a meal.  Union Bistro was a great discovery. It was my first time here & I was not disappointed. Excellent service we were seated right away by the hostess & got to enjoy a lovely view from the window which we appreciated .  I  also commend the prompt service as it was Valentines & we didn't have reservations. I ordered the tomato basil soup which was excellent & really hit the spot on a cold day. Very  Nice ambiance too. I loved the grapes on the vine near the bar area. Very nice touches! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Unless you're wanting basic prep style food and fix at home fare, then don't go here!  Over cooked salmon, blah rice, a basic canned crab taste, crab cake patty on a NOT brioche roll...  rice and salad was basic and veggies over cooked.  Our view of the bus room was a bit odd,,,  scraping dirty dishes, cleaning spills with dirty linen napkins, wait staff eating snacks (yes they were not on break, they were waiting tables)   we were not offered desert.  Our waitress only came to our table with water, took our order, and brought our bill, that's it!   we were finishing our meal when she came by the table, left the tab, not a word and no eye contact, kept going!!!!   we waited a bit, but she never came back...was standing in the bus room....  we ate the mints (best part) left some cash, and left.  we will NOT return there!!!!!   The food was safe but blah!  I would rate the food at about 1/2 the charged price and the service as fast food level. Maybe their catering is more their point of business, but after tasting their \"special menu items\" I wouldn't be interested in their catering either."}
{"text":"The scene: Sunday Brunch. Fairly crowded and - once seated, our waitress, Autumn, greeted us with the not so good news that the orders in the kitchen were behind in being processed. We didn't mind, since we were in the mood for lighter fair, and reasoned that what we would be ordering would not be labor intensive to begin with. We settled on the chicken salad - one with fries and the other with fruit. The wait staff all appeared to be scrambling as if not working in sections, but after placing the menus in a stack as an indication we were ready to order, Autumn came and took our order. Overall, a good experience despite a little bit of a wait. The food was good and we will go back to try a sampling of the dinner menu."}
{"text":"The place didn't have a lot of people when we came in so service was excellent. I had the ribeye stake and peppered tuna for appetizer. Great wine also for a very affordable price. very cozy place and great food for the $$"}
{"text":"Everything at Union Street Bistro was amazing. We had the seared tuna and crab fritters for an appetizer. I ordered the Tuscan chicken and he had the NY strip and both were cooked to perfection. For dessert I had the strawberry balsamic ice cream with basil whipped cream and it was one of the best desserts I have had in a very long time. I haven't had a meal this amazing in years and I strongly suggest trying Union Street Bistro."}
{"text":"Union Street Bistro is one of our favorite restaurants. The food is amazing and the prices are great!! You can't go wrong with a dinner for two - including appetizer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and a bottle of wine - for around $80. Quality of food is equivalent to most fine dining restaurants but a MUCH better value! We love the baked brie, fried green tomatoes, warm spinach salad, shrimp tortellini, and the crab cakes! Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner tonight.  I like trying to support small, local businesses.  However, I will definitely not be returning!!!  The service was a COMPLETE NIGHTMARE!!!!  Servers were rude and completely forgetful!  From the get go when we walked in, one lady was on the phone, the other completely ignored us, and avoided eye contact because she was busy looking for something.  However, I knew she saw the group of us there.  They were out of three things that we asked for!  The service was almost to the point of being embarrassing!  The food was just mediocre.  Such a shame!!  Ruined my sat. night out for sure!  Chick Fil-A has much more flavorful food, and stellar service in complarison!  Should have listened to my kids' request, but I needed to use my groupon.  Wonder if they treated us this way because we were using a groupon?  But nonetheless, this should not have mattered.  The groupon was not free.  DISAPPOINTED!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to destination for both business lunches and special occasion dinners.  Or even just to have a glass or wine and some appetizers with friends while watching the Arts Walk going on in lovely downtown Concord!  Service is awesome and the food always delights.  I have a vegetarian friend and the kitchen ALWAYS bends over backwards to personalize their dish to accommodate their preferences.  Oriental Chicken Salad is my fave.  That homemade dressing is crack!!"}
{"text":"Nice dinner at the Bistro. The wait staff was prompt while the food was prepared well and quickly. We started with Fried green tomatoes, in a nice Cajun crawfish sauce. The pepper seared Tuna was cooked to order and heavily encrusted with cracked black pepper, the crab stuffed flounder was very nice with good deal of lump crab in the stuffing, the ribeye was large and cooked to order, the PB&J was even prepared well with a nice fruit cup as a side. On a busy night downtown parking might be interesting but don't let that scare you away, well worth a short walk for a fine meal."}
{"text":"WOW! Must go...very good service added to very good meal equals a superb restaurant. ..very good..."}
{"text":"The food, service and price were great! I took one star off because my husband felt like the decor was a little out dated. I thought the decor was fine and most importantly clean!"}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to go for Restaurant week, so this review is a little overdue. Please, please go here to eat!!!! The food was amazing, the service was spectacular and the atmosphere is very calm and cozy! I got the sesame seated tuna and it was the best tasting tuna I've had in a long time! Then I ordered the NY strip and it was cooked to perfection! Melt in your mouth good!!! And the as gratin potatoes were very good! Then for desert I got the fireball bourbon cake and it was to die for!!!! Will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"I do love the food here.  The cajun sauce is so good and the salmon is always cooked perfectly.  The service here has been slow... The last two times I have had to sit with an empty plate and glass waiting for my check for at least 15-20 minutes.  We did sit outside which may be the issue... I think she forgot we were out there (there was what appeared to be a wedding reception going on inside at the same time).  The other times we have sat inside we did not have an issue with slow service.  Will definitely be back... we save this place for date nights when we have a sitter."}
{"text":"So today's visit was with my sister and a sweet three year old child from my Nannie days. We ate a quick bite in between vet appointments and shopping. The staff is always friendly and while our little one clearly brought the average age waaaay down, she was well behaved and they were very accomodating for her.   I had the Chicken Florentine Panini minus tomatoes and it was good, though not spectacular, just lacking a whole lot of flavor. Fries were okay, surely from a bag, but the little one liked them very much.  My sister had the baked potato soup and a chicken salad crossaint and enjoyed it a lot. Little bit had grilled cheese and fruit and it was a large portion for the money.   The lunch crowd was quite diverse, mostly grandparently, but a couple of construction guys came in and the wait staff was unfazed and they fit right in.   Union Street Bistro is a quaint little spot for a meal...check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get. My chicken sandwich was a small piece of a grilled chicken breast filleted to make it appear larger."}
{"text":"Here for Sunday Brunch.  Not crowded, so we were seated immediately. The Hostess and waitress were very friendly.   The brunch menu is VERY limited.  Had I been able to access it online, we wouldn't have even tried it. I think brunch should be a special menu, but this wasn't even as extensive as their regular lunch menu. Very disappointing.    My daughter ordered the turkey panini and I had the chicken salad croissant. I'm pretty picky about chicken salad, and this was really good. Fresh fruit was my side. My daughter said her sandwich was \"fine\". Interpret that as you like, coming from a teenager.  It was hot and the fries were well seasoned and crispy.   Overall, the food was good and so was the service. But if you're looking for something special, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"We just had a family reunion dinner and it was wonderful.  The appetizers are the best.  Go for simple grilled meat and seafood.  The wine prices are such that it is better to get a bottle than glasses."}
{"text":"Went tonight for dinner.  We've been a regular at this restaurant for years and always loved it in the past and recommended to folks. Very disappointing tonight going there and the prices are now as expensive as a fine dining in downtown Charlotte.  This restaurant is not in the same league to warrant these kind of prices.  The quality is ok, but not at that kind of level price.  The food was just ok and get this, the menu was charging $8.50 for a bowl of soup and everything else has risen way too much to go back.  I think this will cost them business in the restaurant as well as catering jobs."}
{"text":"Why not make a trip to downtown Concord and take care of some early holiday shopping...and stop at a great restaurant for lunch...I have had the opportunity recently to dine in this quaint sidewalk bistro for both lunch and dinner.  The chef is great and what I like most is all the staff really work as a team in this place, whether you're greated by the manager, waitstaff or the chef himself you will be sure to have fantastic service.  Now for the food great sandwiches, (huge sandwiches), salads, seafood, and steaks.  I've heard rumors that you won't find a better steak in the area I opted to try a seafood item instead the stuffed flounder and I was not disapointed.   Don't leave without a slice of cheesecake either.  This place is great for groups the restaurant is quite large and there is a banquet room in the back for corporate lunches and events."}
{"text":"Not a fan after their Catering truck about ran me off the road on Church street."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. We had the chicken bruschetta and  mediterranean shrimp and both were delicious and the portions were more than enough. The cheddar grits were also very good. The staff is very friendly and was more than accommodating when i called the day before to move our reservations back.  Will definitely be back and recommend this to anyone looking for a nice downtown place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"they get really high points for trying but it really was not a winner for us. Some parts of the meal were pretty darn good, others really, really not. The wine enthusiastically suggested by our server was so horrible we were speechless. Not returning, but wish them luck."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, and was quite surprised at the high quality of food and surroundings.  The soup is to die for (get a cup - its rich) and the sandwich was made with ingredients so fresh that you can smell them before actually putting them in your mouth.  What a great lunch - highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a nice little hidden gem a little off the beaten path- 3 miles from I-85.  We decided to try it out after reading the Yelp review, great seafood choices with very good prices on steak and fish items.  I had the blackened Salmon and highly recommend.  Beer choices rather slim and only offered in bottles.  The place is more of a wine place and offers plenty of diversity there.  Great atmosphere ( white table cloths), nice bar area, and large banquet area with a good feel."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying the crab soup was good, but cold to lightly warm. We had 2 salads, the Caesar salad had be dressing on the side, not shaken/mixed in - this could just be the way they make their salad. However the Cobb salad was a HUGE disappointment. It was supposed to be served on mixed greens, but it came in all iceberg lettuce. I asked the server and he jokingly said he could have it replaced and walked away... Not a good place to eat. Maybe, and hopefully their sandwiches are better"}
{"text":"Turkey panini plus fries or fruit... excellent choice for a lazy Sunday afternoon brunch meal. $7.29"}
{"text":"Delicious grilled salmon and greenbean lunch! I paid 3 times as much at other restaurants and it tasted half as good. Def recommend!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend for Sunday Brunch.  When I worked in Concord, during the week this was one of my favorite lunch spots. Good food, nice atmosphere and a great place to continue business discussions.  Noticed that they now have a Sunday Brunch that starts at 11 am which is early enough for us to get there from Church, have Brunch and get back home in time for my football maniac wife to catch the 1 pm NFL kickoff  Arrived just after 11 and as soon as we walked in, we had a problem.  The phone rang, the hostess answered it and proceeded to take a reservation. Two other employees were standing there just waiting.  I could understand it if if the hostess controlled the flow but just as she hung up, one of the two employees standing there, took it on herself to seat us  They could have done that when we walked in the door.  Nice atmosphere and they took our drink orders quickly.  My wife ordered the Steak Salad and I ordered the mini crabcake Eggs Benedict.  My wifes order came out ok but I ended up with Turkey Bacon Eggs Benedict which is a big difference.  They did correct it for which I give them credit.   The Benedict was way too salty and as for the English Muffin, it was more like an over cooked English Cracker. Did not make for a very good dining experience  In the end, we ended up sitting there for an eternity until my wife flagged down our server to get our check.  Almost created chaos because Mama does not like to miss her football.  As for myself, I went to the Greek Festival in Charlotte  All in all, great during the week but would not recommend Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"Really good food. So, if you're looking for a quite dinner for two then you've found a good spot to eat. Pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch a little while ago and had a very quick and simple lunch.  I ordered a simple Chef Salad and added grilled chicken to it.  The wine of choice was Peter Mertes Reisling which complimented the chicken.  The chicken had perfect flavor and the salad was so large that I couldn't even finish it.  The dressing was to die for.  You know how most restaurants each have their own distinct flavor when it comes to ranch dressing?  Well Union Street Bistro had the perfect mix. Need catering, they do it all!  Several events at the hotel I work for have been catered by them.  They do an outstanding job and are very professional.  Just give them a call or stop by the restaurant, located in the heart of Historic Downtown Concord.  Just watch what time you go in, they open for lunch, take a break, and reopen for dinner."}
{"text":"I'll give them an A for effort.  We went for brunch.  Cute faux bistro space, if just a touch kitschy.   The service was very friendly and the prices were very agreeable.    Food was just ok.  Not terrible, but fairly forgettable.  I had Eggs Benedict and the eggs were way overcooked and the Hollandaise looked like it came from a packet.  None of the food tasted bad though, just safe, kinda boring fare.    If you just want a solid meal, it's a good place to go.  If you consider self even a slight foodie, this is probably not your ideal place."}
{"text":"A great dinner. The Mediterranean Baked Shrimp was delicious - loved the olives and artichoke hearts with the shrimp!!  My husband was pleased with his Crab Stuffed Flounder.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"The interior of this restaurant really needs updating. Looks like an old folks home. But the food was great! I had a salad for lunch. It was very fresh, tasty and the dressing was great. My dining companions also had salads and they raved about theirs. I would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there's such high reviews here?!?  We went for my fiancé's birthday.  Very inexpensive wine!  We started with a bottle.  Appetizer was lobster dip (very salty, no flavor).  For dinner I had the Filet.  It was CHARRED black on the outside and that flavor made it so I could hardly taste the meat.  Considering it ruined the steak I was very disappointed.  I liked the side (cheesy grits) better than my steak, which is just sad!  I've had better sirloins at Outback, and I'm talking the $10 steaks there.  Cooking it wrong just ruins it.  He got a stuffed fish dish (I think flounder?) that he later told me was not good.  (I took him for his 40th birthday and he did not want to complain to me.)   He said it was flavorless.  They gave him a choice if free dessert, which was very nice!  Too bad it ( pecan pie) was also horrible.  :(. We took the rest home and threw it away.  We are not food snobs and this place was just not good at all!!!  We won't be back.  Not worth it, even if it's not overly pricey."}
{"text":"A great place to relax and enjoy a great meal that is prepared well. Four of us dined here recently and everything was great. The portions were commendable, as was the service. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My mom and I dined-in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and it's a decent place.   I had  grilled chicken salad and my mom had a wrap. The staff was really nice and the food was great. It didn't seem super busy/crowded, but wait time seemed a tad long... It is otherwise a very cool,casual, family-type spot. The dining area is small and completely open/cafeteria-like. One other cool thing about this place is the local art on the wall that is up for sale. I had passed by this place many times intending to visit and I'm glad I finally did. I'll certainly return..."}
{"text":"Truly the best salmon I've ever had in my life!  It was flawlessly prepared.  This locally owned restaurant has the trifecta- superior service, food and atmosphere. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I was here three years ago and the food and service was so good that I was sure to dine at the Bistro again since I was in town again today. The food is amazing, service is great, the atmosphere is warm and downtown Concord is soo delightful."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch after church! The eggs benedict was delicious.  Steak and eggs were prepared to perfection!  The focacia bread is amazing. Atmosphere is elegant yet inviting and the staff is wonderfully accommodating.  Sarah Walters was such a sweetie and ensured our bottomless tea glasses were always full!"}
{"text":"I ate here for my birthday with my family last year. None of us enjoyed what we ordered. There are much better choices in the area."}
{"text":"I really liked USB.  It's a rare place that is neither fancy nor casual a nice in between. Great food and fair prices."}
{"text":"Had an incredible meal (AGAIN) there last night. The special was an 8oz Fillet - it was succulent, tender, and not crowded by the mushroom sauce.  Others in the party had the Chicken Marsala, the Grilled Shrimp, the Sashimi Tuna. We split an order of the Crab Fritters.   The service, food, and atmosphere was off the charts."}
{"text":"I hoped this local downtown restaurant could be our local go to place. Took our son for his birthday and we were underwelmed. The decor was pleasant and service wasn't any major problem but the food seemed reheated prepared meal. We had a chicken Marsala that appeared to be a precooked piece of chicken with what appeared to be a beef gravy....not Marsala! The fish stuffed with crab was OK but lacked character and can only be discribed as bland. The cheesecake for dessert was definitely previously frozen and sliced to order. Overall very dissapointing."}
{"text":"We went there tonight for the restaurant week. It has been few years since we last ate hear due to prices being very high and the quality not so much. We thought to give it another chance but we were disappointed once more. I had the tomato soup and my husband got the loaded potato soup. They were both ok. For appetizers I got fried green tomatoes which was soggy and tasteless, never had worse. Husband got the spinach artichoke dip and it was equally bad. For the main course he had a New York strip and it was very well cook. I had a Tuscan chicken with fettuccine Alfredo. The chicken was awful. Instead of Parmesan it was coated with a thick layer of egg. I ate only a bite and had to stop. Both our desserts were just ok. I think my sons grilled cheese was had more flavor than any of our courses. Oh and the waitress was rude to top that. If you are in the neighborhood, go next door to Gianni's. Much better food and service."}
{"text":"Came to this place for lunch in my continuing quest for great salads in the Charlotte area and near my office. I got the Southwestern Cobb and it was very good. Fresh greens, lots of avocado, nice grilled chicken and a very nice avocado ranch dressing.   My coworker got a turkey sandwich with apples on it and said it was very good. He was also impressed with the sweet potato tots.   He would have liked to have tried dessert, but the service was terrible. We sat outside and we think she totally forgot about us and we had to wait a LONG time for our food and check.   Still - the food was very good once it arrived and I'll definitely give them another chance to show better service.   Adding this to my list of Best Salads in Charlotte here on Yelp."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this Italian. The food is more like fancy  American bistro. The colors are nice and a little romantic but the place is old. The floors squeak, the carpet didn't go with the whole theme, and the table covers were vinyl. Hardwood floors, and white table clothes would have made this place better. The menu was small and simple but the items on the menu didn't go with one type of cuisine style. Smoked chicken nachos which was served with red, white, and blue chips was a little tacky, then they had seared tuna with a wasabi soy sauce on the same menu as chicken marsala. Sorry, that's just too weird for me. They might as well have offered fried rice on the menu. Other than this place having mistaken identity the food was good. However it wasn't very good. But for the price and atmosphere, this place was worth the try."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's due to being in Concord for the day. I must say the atmosphere was really nice, and the food was great. I had the Chicken Marsala and the Warm Spinach Salad. Chicken Marsala was great, as for the Spinach Salad, anything I order in the future will be accompanied by the spinach salad. My wife had the Tuscan Chicken, she loved it. The only hitch was a member of our party ordered a steak medium, and it came out with a warm red center. I have always considered that medium rare. She requested it to be cooked further, and when it came back out it looked no different. Maybe they were confused because another member ordered medium rare and his looked medium. However I think it should have been corrected after returned to the kitchen. Over all it was a great place though."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this catering rating is not based whatsoever on the food...because we never got any. This was the most bizarre interaction I've ever had with another human being, so I need to share it.  I had scheduled a catering tasting with Union Street Bistro a month in advance (Dec. 11 for a Jan. 16 tasting). Mind you, the restaurant suggested the catering date; I simply agreed to it and added it to my calendar.  I'll also say, up front, the man in charge of catering was very apologetic about the end result of all this and it was clearly not intentional, but he was also 45 minutes late to our tasting.  Now the weird part: there was another couple scheduled for a wedding catering tasting that evening. The five of us (the two couples and the caterer) were seated at a table, and this man never once spoke to us or looked at us. After 20 minutes of sitting there being ignored, we spoke up and told him he had obviously made a mistake.   It's one thing to forget to add someone's appointment to your schedule (mix-ups happen), but it's another to be 45 minutes late and then not ever acknowledge half the people SITTING AT THE TABLE WITH YOU.   For fun, I've attached a screenshot of my fiancé and my texting conversation during the tasting when we were trying to figure out what was happening.   I'd probably avoid this for your wedding...?"}
{"text":"My fiance took me to Union Street Bistro for my birthday and we order the filet special with balsamic reduction. It was delicious and perfectly cooked. Perfect steak and crisp green beans.  The interior is warm and comfy. Very nice place for a romantic dinner or simply to drink a few glasses of wine.   This experience and the variety on their menu will make me visit again and again."}
{"text":"If we would have gotten waited on, I could leave a review.    Walked in at 5 pm.  Was asked if we had a reservation.  We did not.  The host had to ask if they could serve us.   We were able to be served apparently.   After sitting for several minutes, we left.  No one came by the table to greet us or get our drink orders.    We sat for so long looking at the menu that we already knew what we wanted.   As we got up to leave, I assume, our waitress was just about to bring us waters.    I walked by and told her, \"too late\".  There was only one occupied table at 5 pm.    Boo!!!"}
{"text":"A go-to after-church brunch spot in downtown Concord. American standards- grilled chicken with rice and veg, baked/grilled salmon, in a white-tablecloth setting. Nothing daring, but nothing your grandmother would turn her nose up at, either.   They put together a decent benedict, and the Cobb salad is my personal fave of the menu. Friendly, not overly sophisticated service, you're sure to see old friends of your parents or grandparents there, Sunday best. I'm glad to see it surviving and staking a good claim on Union Street, which badly needs to be able to draw people downtown."}
{"text":"I've been here a lot but only because other people want to go. The food is pretty mediocre and the service is alright."}
{"text":"I got fettuccini alfredo, plain,  with no chicken which was probably a mistake.  This is not an Italian restaurant and I should have known better.  The pasta was VERY dry and I couldn't really finish it.  I would recommend getting fish or steak, and will choose that next visit.    The service was good.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.  The space was quiet and comfortable.  They serve warm rolls with dinner that were tasty!  The sweet tea is the best tea I have ever tasted, I would go back for that alone.  I will definitely try again and order something different."}
{"text":"Great little bistro in downtown Concord! My husband and I were in town the other night and decided to check out this restaurant. When you walk in, the decor makes it feel like the restaurant is one of those high end 5 star restaurants with a very expensive price tag - but it is NOT expensive at all. All of the meals were very well priced and actually better pricing than other restaurants nearby.   Bar menu - they had one of my husband's favorite bourbons, so he was happy. I did not even look at the wine list, so I cannot comment on whether there is a decent selection or not.  On to the food - yummy!!! My husband had the wedge salad. He said it was perfect - lettuce was crisp (as was the bacon), the blue cheese crumbles were yummy and bacon was perfect. I had a cup of the crab soup - very creamy and delicious. We split the Honey Dijon Chicken Sandwich which comes on a toasted and buttered pretzel bun - it is also delicious! The chicken is very tender and the honey Dijon is very very good. I prefer a little more honey Dijon on my sandwich than was on it, but I asked for a small side of it and server quickly brought it - perfect! The seasoned fries are great as well. The rolls that are brought out prior to the meal are the best rolls we have had at a restaurant in a very long time! They were hot, soft and served with real butter. When we come to Concord again, we'll definitely come back and we also will recommend to our friends and family in the area."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere, good location.   I ordered the Chicken Fettucini Alfredo, great flavored chicken and Alfredo sauce. My wife ordered the crab cake sandwich, and she enjoyed it very much.   Service was slow, however...there was a wedding rehearsal dinner in the next room, so I am assuming this is why the service was not quick.  Owner of the restaurant visited my wife and I's table to ask if everything was satisfactory.  Would visit again, but not if a private party is going on."}
{"text":"Amazing food, even better service. And you can't beat the price! More of an intimate atmosphere but the food and service make it worth it."}
{"text":"This was the perfect place to come to on Valentine's Day. The Bistro was decorated with heart cutouts and lit soft light tea candles throughout the dining area. Our waitress was very attentive, ( she was one of the managers filling in) it's nice to know management will put the work gloves on if needed.  Our Dinner came quickly and our dinner drink glasses were constantly filled. There was even horrible opera music playing softly in the background. (I'm not an opera fan).  We had to wait in line to even enter the building, a good sign the food must be good. Everyone was eagerly waiting to get in and start chowing down.   It was a very pleasant and romantic evening."}
{"text":"I had a good experience attending dinner. I had the steak which was really good. Server was really nice."}
{"text":"We rarely venture out to Concord, but a Groupon deal to a tasty new restaurant is just the thing to tempt us out of our comfort zone. It ended up being worth the trip, despite having to travel through the NASCAR-center of North Carolina.  Union Street Bistro is located in a cozy downtown section of Concord, surrounded by other local businesses. The interior is comfy and intimate...the perfect place for date night. The tables aren't spaced too close together and the place is was quiet...a little too quiet. Then the live music started and a guy and girl singing and playing guitar serenaded us the remainder of the meal, which was a great experience.  The wine selection was decent, and the prices were perfect ($6 for a glass of Reisling was right where it should be). For an appetizer we shared the baked brie ($7), which was the perfect size for two to share. A hot brie wheel was topped with pesto and served alongside honeydew, strawberries, cantaloupe, and fresh bread. The brie and pesto were a great combo on top of the bread, and the fruit was fresh. However, I felt the melons were a poor choice of fruit to accompany the brie...I would have preferred something crisper/ tarter like an apple, or maybe a pear.    For dinner I ordered the ribeye steak ($18) which was cooked to medium rare perfection. It was an extremely tender cut of meat and tasty, but it was slightly lacking a strong beef flavor. The only real issue I had with the steak was that it was salted a bit too much for my preference. For a side I went with the scalloped potatoes which were not what I expected. Rather than sliced and cheesy, it was more a scoop of mashed potatoes with a few potato chunk slices mixed within. It was also extremely herby, and I think the chef had a heavy hand with the thyme (much like the salt with the steak.) It also came with the daily vegetable, which happened to be green beans. They were cooked to perfection and pretty darn tasty.  The missus opted for the sesame seared tuna (($17) which was pretty darn tasty. It was cooked to that perfect rare and was super tastetacular. The cheddar grits were pretty good, and I'm not generally super crazy about grits.   Despite our large meal, the wine and the music had us in a mood where we weren't quite ready to head out yet. We decided to split a dessert and took a look at the menu. They only had a few cakes as desserts, and we chose the carrot cake ($6.) The slice of cake was ginormous, and there is no way anyone should eat a whole slice on their own...definitely needs a two person minimum disclaimer. While the size was right, the taste was \"ok.\" The cake was missing that spice flavor and was somewhat on the bland side. The cream cheese frosting was also not that flavorful and was kind of mild. Not exactly the perfect dessert experience, but good enough.  Union Street Bistro is a great dinner spot for you and a loved one if you happen to be in downtown Concord. The main menu is diverse with a varied selection, and the prices are definitely worth it for what you get. I don't know that we would be in a rush to come back here again based on the location, but if we're in the area and want a nice, intimate meal this will be our first thought."}
