{"text":"So you may ask, why were you in this neighbourhood?  People hang out on Marlee Avenue?  Well, I work near there.  And I usually bring my lunch in a neatly packed eco-bag with delicious salads in glass tupperware.  However, sometimes everyone in my office is lazy, and when that happens we call Paul's Tomato Pie.    They are a pleasure on the phone and deliver everything on time and still hot.  My favourite pizza is the Spinach White Pie, which has no tomato sauce, and lots of cheese, garlic and spinach on top.  Terrible for the waist line, delicious for the stomach."}
{"text":"These guys have great pizza and good service.  I've been ordering pizza there since I moved to the city and haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"I'm not a big pizza fan but on this day I didn't mind it seeing as its been a while.  They make pretty good pizza. I asked for it well done and they did it perfect. Price is fair and they have a big menu including fries, fried calamari, veal and meatball sandwiches and pasta.  I would recommend this place for a cheap local pizza place. They have a walk in special which is $9.99 for a Large pepperoni pizza and pop. I don't drink pop so I asked if I can substitute it with an extra topping instead of the pop and they had no problem doing that!"}
{"text":"T'was in the moon of wintertime...  It was the Great Ice Storm of 2013.   The power had been off for days; the fridge was bare, and I had braved ice-slicked streets to protect my new home.  I was alone, having sent my spouse to my in-laws', where she could be warm for the night. I was determined to defend my homestead from sleet and snow, wandering bands of marauders and zombie hordes.   OK, maybe I was just checking the place out before heading North myself. I ran the taps, checked the windows, and helped Santa get the presents ready for my beloved's return.   Just as I was about to head out, a Festivus Miracle!  With my hand on the doornkob, turning to let me out into the blackest night, I heard the alarm go BEEEEP and saw a flash of light.   Power had returned!  What better way to celebrate than with a hot shower, and a pizza?  I didn't know who to call, but figured that friends on Marlee had been unscathed, so there was a chance Paul might deliver.   And deliver he did. A small pie, loaded with quality toppings, slightly charred and still mouth-searing hot. It was the kind of old school pizza you'd think had died out.   It was delicious.   The only downside was that, for a relatively small order it was expensive. My pie cost about $10, to which they added an absurd delivery charge of $4-nearly half the cost of my pizza.   I was starving, and elated so I didn't mind.   I'd order from Paul's again in a heartbeat; I would just make sure I was having friends over (or a working freezer), to make sure I got my money's worth.   All that said, I am still grateful that in a frozen wasteland, Paul delivered."}
