{"text":"Is this place ever open?! I've tried to go at least 5 times (during the posted hours) and they are always closed. I give up and I hope you close up shop for good. I've never made such an effort to go somewhere to continuously be so disappointed."}
{"text":"NOP! Was very excited for this new resto to open up the street from my house, however was there once and will not return.

I wanted a roast beef sandwich however they all had bbq sauce on them. errrrr...no thnx...

So I opted for a ham and salami. I decided not to have the mortadella mainly because it looked gross. 

SO, my sandwich consisted of one slice of ham, one slice of salami and 1 slice of cheese.

There was some lettuce on top w/ a balsamic dressing.

All of this on a stale, stale kaiser.

I had to go and get a burrito right after mainly because I was starving."}
{"text":"Clean, beautiful space and the best turkey sandwich I've ever had. I popped in here a couple of weeks ago to try it out and I can't stop going back."}
