{"text":"After reading an article about The Oak Barrel and learning that a previous chef from Deagan's had opened this new restaurant in Valley View, we had to check it out. We had never visited the space, which was previously Hoggy's. As usual, we took a quick look online. The website seemed to be still under construction, but the menu was very promising. We decided to check it out on Taco Tuesday and are really glad we did!

The first thing we noticed was the awesome patio with an open-pit fireplace and oak barrels all around. Very inviting, and I suspect we will find ourselves there often this summer. The interior entrance is expansive and surprising. Straight ahead is a two-level dining room with both intimate tables and long tables suitable for community dining and large parties. We were told the upstairs is mostly for events and large parties as well as overflow for the busy weekends.

We opted for the large bar area because it seemed lively. We immediately noticed the intriguing, rare craft beers set along the bar, and the incredibly extensive craft beer list. We learned that they rotate this list monthly and the beers are all-craft, no-crap. Cheers to that!

The menu has something for everyone, with many local ingredients, and I was thrilled with the multitude of vegetarian options. Since it was Taco Tuesday, we felt compelled to go with that menu. I had the Vegan Unicorn Tacos, made with crispy seitan, a local radish slaw, arugula, and a sweet chili sauce to finish. They were so bright and flavorful - a great blend of sweet with a little kick of spice. The husband had a Spicy Shrimp Taco - perfectly cooked shrimp that popped, with well-balanced flavors and a fresh cilantro finish, and an Asian Chicken Taco which he did not like as much - it may have just been his order, but the orange-soy glaze overpowered everything else. He had also been eyeballing the free-range turkey burger on the menu, and decided to try that as well. It came on a brioche bun and he subbed in some garlicky green beans rather than fries. He said it was really good and he'd get it again.

Our bartender, Caspian, took good care of us, and answered all of our many questions, offering up additional information on nightly specials, music and brunch."}
{"text":"We arrived around 925 pm. I was glad that even though they closed at 10, our server was still perky and friendly. We took advantage of the \"free duck popcorn with check in\". It was perfectly truffled for me. Not over the top. We decided on a variety of appetizers. The chicken livers was wonderful if you got a perfect bite with pork belly. Otherwise it needed a tiny bit of salt. The eggplant rolltini was perfect-the house made marinara was addictive. I had to have a side of the sautéed leeks with spinach and mashed potatoes- I could eat those with every meal. 
We asked our server for one more recommendation. She picked the calamari. It was a little overlooked, just ok. I would have preferred it over the marinara as opposed to the over utilized Asian style but I was full on the rest anyway.  I hope to go there again and save room for the Dragons milk brownie Sunday."}
{"text":"4 of us decided to give The Oak Barrel a try after seeing a movie last Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant was decorated nicely and seemed warm & welcoming.  It wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. We were put in a dark corner under one of the many TVs, but it was turned down so it wasn't too distracting.
Our server was pleasant enough (at first) but seemed overwhelmed by having to wait on us and the other 2 (or 3?) tables in her station. She couldn't seem to get it together. Getting our drinks seemed to be a challenge (\"the bar is really busy\") and the food took an extraordinarily long time. When it did arrive the salads and soups came out with the entrees. We sent the salads and soups back...we really wanted those as a first 'course'. The food was okay, but when one of our party took a bite of his pulled pork sandwich and pulled a piece of plastic wrap out of his mouth, we really had enough. We had to ask for waters (twice) and salad dressing for a salad that came out dry. The manager came out & apologized for the plastic wrap issue and took that meal off our bill & tried a halfhearted humorous approach (though it would have cost him A LOT more if someone would have choked on that bit of plastic).
This is really a nice space, but the folks at Oak Barrel need to get it together. The servers and kitchen need some serious training on customer service and how to get meals to the table in the right order (and without the plastic \"surprise\" in the food)."}
{"text":"Great staff. Attentive and professional but not annoying, which is harder than it sounds. Chicken liver small plate was a nice surprise, main courses were ok. Nice place, very large and noisy."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to get sloshed before or after you plunk down $45 to see the latest, greatest, overratedest 3-D blockbuster extravaganza at Ye Olde Cinemark in Valley View, the Oak Barrel is an admirable choice. It's a bit different from the type of eatery that usually thrives around the local googleplex in the fact that it is neither a chain nor a sports bar. It's a fancy-schmancy gastropub, and not a bad one either. 

Let's focus on the booze first, because that's generally what I do (sadly). Good gravy. There are about 30 or so beer-snob approved draft choices to choose from, with each available in 6, 11, and 16 oz sizes. Hell. Yes. This means if you're a lightweight like me, and your first pint of some 9% IPA got you feeling pretty good, you can follow it up with a wussy little 6 oz. thimble so you don't have to worry about getting so wrecked that you have to pull over and sleep on the towpath on your way home. Moving beyond the drafts, the bottle and whiskey selection are pretty outstanding too.

The food has some standout appetizers (duck fat popcorn, Bourbon Barrel Ale onion rings) and entrees (the Dr. Pepper pork shank), but the prices are a bit high and some of the dishes miss the mark of what you would expect from that high of a price point. The menu is fairly expansive, and it will certainly take a few more trips to uncover all the hits and misses.

And since I'm too lazy to write much more, here's the rest of the review in a dozen words or so: service is generally slow, the seating is ample, the patio is decent.

Good day."}
{"text":"We have eaten at the Oak Barrel several times and it has been consistently amazing.  I think that speaks volumes for a restaurant when you can go  more than once and receive the same exceptional quality food and service.  It is in our top 5 favorite places to eat.  The pulled pork over jalapeno cornbread with onion straws and apple slaw is my absolute fav.  My husband loves the Dr. Pepper pork shank.  Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We were part of a large party, 13 people with an infant, and arrived a little late for our reservation.  I expected a cool reception and at best some higher end bar food.  
I (we) were pleasantly surprised.
The service and food was first class.  
It was 1/2 price wine night and i was ready for cheap cabs and some white zin.  Wrong.  The wine was reasonably priced and very good.
We ordered shrimp tacos, Dr.Pepper pork and chicken & waffles.
All were great.  We'll be back.
Friendly staff, great food and good prices.
I'm looking forward to summer so we can try out the patio."}
{"text":"We (party of 6) arrived at 6pm for dinner and were seated fairly quickly. Service was good and staff was friendly. Large beer selection and the food was more upscale then I was expecting. Everyones food was delicious. Lamb burger, Chicken herb salad, Sunny side burger, open faced bbq pulled pork and the club house were all incredible. I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here after stopping at the Giant Eagle on Saturday for a quick lunch. When we walked into the Oak Barrel, we were surprised by how gorgeous the inside was. There are two levels of seating with wood flooring and walls covering the restaurant, with a contemporary feel. We sat at the bar for some beers. Their draft beer list is extensive and impressive. We also ordered their Devils on Horseback appetizer, which came with three dates, but if we had it our way, we probably would have ordered 10 more orders. They were absolutely delicious, with the right balance of sweet and savory. Also, we ordered the Calamari appetizer, which unlike most Calamari, was not over breaded and had a nice Asian flavoring to it. Unfortunately, the only \"con\" I will give this place, is the prices were on the higher side for the portion sizes. The three dates ran us $8 and the bowl of Calamari was $10, which seem a bit high for lunch. 

The restaurant seems to run specials on various nights of the week, including 1lb of Crab on Mondays for $15 and Taco Tuesdays. We will definitely be making a trip back during the week."}
{"text":"What a great find while in the area from out of town.  The ahi tacos and the calamari were fantastic.  The service was great and very friendly.  I would highly recommend it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Are there last night and had a wonderful experience. The food was great, as was the service and atmosphere. I knew immediately when I walked in and smelled a delightful balance of oak, whiskey, and barbecue that I was in a good place!  I had the stuffed egg as an appetizer and the Kefta burger for my entree. Both were excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm here every Tuesday after biking with friends in the valley. Simply saying Taco Tuesday does not do justice to the uniqueness of their taco selection; Spicy Shrimp, Tuna, Pork ...etc. Add in the special taco - anything from sausage and lamb to walleye and turtle (yes turtle). Pair with a wide variety of craft beers, wine and specialty drinks, 

The main menu boasts the same unique qualities - having had pomme' frites, duck fat popcorn, mussels, chicken and waffles ...etc. Not a bad selection from top to bottom.

Lastly I cannot say enough regarding their staff. As restaurants go my friends and I have never felt more welcomed or attended to. Yes we've become familiar faces to them. However as you notice their interaction and sense of customer care with others you can really appreciate the effort they put in to every guest."}
{"text":"I was really impressed and satisfied with Oak Barrel. My friend, boyfriend, and I went for lunch and all enjoyed our meals. 

The place used to be a Hoggys. There is an upstairs. The bar area is very nice. i would recommend sitting in there if possible.

I ordered the Cuban sandwich with a side of blue cheese whipped potatoes. The sandwich was great and had just enough spice for someone who can't really handle it! It came with a homemade pickle which was not good--not enough salt. It is also served with potato chips. The potatoes were crazy good--really unique. Best mashed potatoes I ever had!

My boyfriend ordered the duck confit mac n cheese. It was delicious but the portion is REALLY SMALL. It's ironic because it's under \"big plates\" on the menu. 

I'd stay away from the chicken livers. I ordered them last time and did not enjoy them. 

Also, my friends tacos came out completely cold and our server was kind of weird. I couldn't take off a star though because I really enjoyed the food!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Love this place. Make sure you try the mac and cheese, the herb crusted chicken salad, and the chicken and waffles! This is one of my family's favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"The five star is for the BBQ pork taco and the environment.
It's the most delicious taco I ever have! And only 2$ each in Tuesday!
The pork and vegetable is so fit together!!!
And the environment here is great!

If the full point is 10, this pork taco is 15, both in flavor and price!

I order chicken taco too.( My friend suggest) It's not my style, but I think it's maybe American style cause my American friend really like it.
I also order raspberry ice tea. She'll ask if you want sweet or unsweet, but it doesn't matter cause the difference is she'll give you some sugar or not...... I don't like it. This is the worst raspberry ice tea I've ever have.....

But because the pork taco is so good. I still decide this restaurant is five stars. And I'll definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after work.  Ordered some apps for the table. 

Wings were great.  Onion rings were almost as great as the wings, really good.  The pretzel was only ok due to the dipping sauces.  I think the cheese sauce needed to be stirred a little longer it was not very smooth. 

Table had enough but I ordered the happy hour burger. It was juicy and the cheese was melted perfectly.  I would order again. 

Someone ordered the flourless cake and she said it was very good.  It looked like a picture from a magazine.  

Service was only ok, place was not busy when we walked in but got busier throughout the night.  For the people who were not drinking refills were slow. 

I would go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I accidentally happened on The Oak Barrel when we visited Cleveland this winder, and we are sure glad for this happy accident!  We recently went back to Cleveland and had to visit The Oak Barrel again!

The Oak Barrel has a great atmosphere and the menu is full of local ingredients.  On our first trip, I had fish and chips, which came with a spicy remoulade.  My husband had the chicken and waffles, which is always a treat.  This time around we had the Duck Fat Popcorn to start.  (SO GOOD! - you could honestly make a meal out of all of their starters!)   I had the Turkey Burger and my husband had the highly recommended Open-Faced Pulled Pork.  Everything was flavorful and great!  We even had dessert, which is rare, but it sounded too good to pass up!  We had a brownie sundae with dragon's milk ice cream.  (Dragon's Milk is a beer, so the ice cream had a little beer-y taste)

I SO wish we had The Oak Barrel near the Dayton area.  The menu is creative and fun - we will definitely be back when we go up north!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic all the way around -smiling, friendly hostesses upon arrival / clean, warm, comfortable atmosphere / great drinks (cool ice cubes!) /  top-notch service / delicious food that we felt was sized and priced perfectly.

My brother and SIL had been there several times, and kept telling me how awesome the Dr. Pepper pork shank was, so I had to order that. They were right. It was spectacular! I don't remember the last time I ate something so delicious.  I tried a bite of my brother's bacon-wrapped tenderloin, and that was amazing too. Another friend got chicken and waffles, and he said it was great. Not only was everything tasty, but the presentation was nice too. Oh, and make sure you order a side of jalapeño cornbread - it was really yummy. We didn't have room for dessert - next time.

Our server, Tara, was that perfect mix of sweet, friendly, knowledgeable, competent, and efficient. She even offered to split the check for our group at the end. 

I'm sure I'll be visiting again soon, and often, to bring all my friends here. I can't wait to watch their reaction when they take that first bite of pork shank, falling off the bone and covered in that delicious sauce. 

This is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos, great drinks...I really enjoy this place! Every time I have been here I have truly enjoyed my meal!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner and had the most delicious baby ribs. The meat was practically falling off the bones. The meal came with plenty of fries and greens. Also you could ask for free duckfat popcorn if you check in thru yelp. We sat behind the bar and it was somewhat loud, but as expected. Would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"went for lunch once and tried it again for dinner~both meals were really delicious, the chix livers were very excellent and chix and waffles did not disappoint!  the service was good and fast and the food came out hot and fast.  the server even gave us a free dessert that was delicious. a nice place close 2 home when u dont feel like driving to clev or tremont"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this restaurant at first since nothing seems to last in this location.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I had no idea this is where the chef from Deagan's went!!!  Holy cow!  The veggie sliders that I loved sooooo much at Deagan's are now on the me u at the Oak Barrel.  YUM!!!

Fries were wonderful!

My husband got the arugula pizza and wasn't too impressed, but Niko quickly came out and apologized.  He was so sweet! 

Independence needed a restaurant like this.  We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the cozy/rustic atmosphere! This place was an unexpected hidden gem in Valley View. I would expect this type of restaurant in Ohio City/Tremont. The cocktails and appetizers were delicious. I was really impressed by the pulled pork barbecue. They definitely know what they're doing with the smoker here. I would love to come back in the summer and enjoy the outdoor area and fire pit."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place at the end of a long drive. A well stocked bar, a huge selection of beer on draft, and good food.   My pulled pork was great!
Would be 5 stars except for a seating delay that seemed unmotivated by anything"}
{"text":"Wrong restaurant, mixed up. This place has the best ribs that you will ever eat. Actually this is the second restaurant we went to was the first one was the one that was closed in Superbowl day. This restaurant oak barrel is always a winner"}
{"text":"Promising. Cool menu.  Probably a little ambitious for the area. Food was fresh and nicely presented.  Service was friendly and nice but slow and clueless. That hurt a little bit. I wasn't blown away but I will probably try once more...

Chicken livers were tasty."}
{"text":"The minestrone soup and kale salad were both delicious!  Lunch service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been in the area for a while so we decided to go to Hoggy's. We get there and find The Oak Barrel instead. We were a little disappointed to find out Hoggy's had left, but we decided to give this place a try. 

We both decided on the ribs with mac and cheese and garlic mash. My husband also got the slaw which we were pleasantly surprised by. I would describe the slaw dressing as more of a sweet vinaigrette rather than a typical slaw dressing. It was really delicious. The ribs were great. They had a nice char, good flavor and easily came clean off the bone. The white mac was amazing. It was creamy, flavorful and was topped with shaved parmesan. The garlic mash.. ugh. That was where I saw need for lots of improvement. They were obviously VERY instant mashed potatoes, very thin and lacking flavor. A good, real mash would've made our meals perfect.

 Food aside, our server was very friendly and she made sure we had everything we needed. The food was well plated. The restaurant was clean with a lovely dark, understated elegance. We'll definitely be back but will opt for the fries next time."}
{"text":"They put a LARGE ice sphere in their Old fashion cocktail-which looks cool, and makes the glass look full costs $13.  When I lifted the ice ball out It was very disappointing to see how small the amount of drink actually was! I returned the drink. My friends ordered food and were quite happy with their meals."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for what you get. Last night I ordered the Amish chicken tacos and there are ONE tiny chicken strip in each taco and all stuffed with veggies. Every time I come here I get more and more disappointed and leave feeling like this place takes advantage of it's customers."}
{"text":"Must try! I have never had a better hamburg ever in Cleveland. Perfection achieved.  Breakfast burg. Eat!"}
{"text":"Not only does this place have great food but they've got some great servers and customer service as well.

We visited for the first time last year and came back the next day with our kids. This is a big deal considering it is almost an hour from our house. The food was THAT good. We really enjoy the menu items that a just a little different from every other restaurant. Duck fat popcorn, duck mac n'cheese, ribs...they're all delicious. 

What made them stand out at our most recent visit was our excellent server and the grace he showed when faced with a bad situation. We took some time deciding what we wanted to drink and I finally decided on a fruity beer. Our server, Joey, came back and explained that the beer I ordered wasn't available. So, I ordered a different one, which was also sold out.  My third choice was also gone...and Joey apologized and apologized and explained that the manager was offering us a free round of drinks for the inconvenience. Finally, my fourth choice was available (and worth the wait...Peche  Lambic). All of our dinners were great and at the end of the meal, not only did we get the round of drinks free, but they also took 20% off our bill! 

Through it all, Joey kept his sense of humor and was truly sorry for the bad turn of events. I'm complimenting the Oak Barrel not because they offered free drinks and the discount, but because they did the right thing. 

We had a great time despite the drink issues. We will def be back."}
{"text":"OMG the Dr. Pepper shank was maybe the best meal I have had in years! So good! I am most definately going back. The service was good and the food didnt take long to get to us I highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Great food, a menu with many delicious options, and a great vibe. They have covered seating options for nice weather days, and an outdoor lounge area with cornhole. This would be an excellent happy hour spot, or a good place to relax after a bike ride on the nearby trails. I would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday, great look and atmosphere.  Had the open faced BBQ sandwich and it had great flavors.  If I order this next time I would ask for a little less BBQ sauce.  The smoke flavor was masked by the sauce."}
{"text":"As a guy who travels a lot for work, BEST Pulled Pork I've EVER had. The selection of craft beers was equally impressive. The rich smokey flavor of the pork, the perfect zip of the jalapeño corn bread base, fresh homemade cole slaw and thin onion rings on top - brilliant!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my daughter for dinner the other day. Tried the bacon wrapped beef tenderloin, simply amazing. The service and food were great. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Fabulous!! Atmosphere is cool. Waitress knew the whiskey and beer menu so she was able to make excellent recommendations. Food was incredible. 

We got three dishes and shared. Pork Shank with the homemade cole slaw - to die for with the meat falling off the bone. It won all of our votes as the top meal. Has a little kick though!

Hangar steak was tender and grilled perfectly. Great flavor!

Duck Mac & Cheese - super yummy. I love that they used nutmeg in this dish.

Definitely going back and trying the Amish Chicken and Waffles!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Ordered a craft beer the bar sent me the wrong one. When I told the server they semi argued with me it was the right one. I know beers I said and it is not an IPA. The manager then came by and said my selection was not available  and if I would like I can order something else and keep the one already poured for free. Other then that I would dine there again."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The BBQ is great. The beer selection is great too."}
{"text":"The staff is wonderful and the bar is very knowledgeable.  It is well worth checking out their taco Tuesday special."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food was good. We attended a work party with a large group that was booked several weeks out. Our service was horrible. Unfortunately our waitress was overwhelmed and could not keep up with our group. Too bad because the food was good but I think a little over priced."}
{"text":"Great, personable service from the moment we walked in the door! Our waitress was knowledgeable of the menu options and was able to share some good recommendations for both  drinks and meal choices. We tried the open faced pulled pork (amazing flavor and the jalapeño cornbread add just the right kick) as well as the chicken and waffles! Nice mix of rustic/ industrial decor. We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late lunch, so there was not many people there. The food was very good, but the service was pretty slow considering the amount of people dining. I did like the rock n roll ambience and the music that was being played."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time.  Not only is the service great, they have an amazing beer, bourbon, and food selection.  The have a Dr. Pepper pork shank that is mouth watering.  It comes with mash potatoes.  I also ordered a side their veggies which is an excellent addiction to this dish.  If you haven't eaten their yet you have to give it a try."}
{"text":"I attended the opening event where I was beyond impressed with everything sampled. Highlights included the melt-in-your-mouth devils on horseback, the lime salted duck fat popcorn and what I am guessing was a flourless chocolate cake. Everything was supreme, but the kicker was THE BEST old fashioned I've had to date. Consider the Oak Barrel highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is trying so hard to be high class but no where near. The open faced pulled pork was blahhh... no sides.. just blah.. the slaw was more lettuce than anything. Not worth the money. Why can't they get good restaurants over by the theater?!?"}
{"text":"We called last minute for a large group (15 people) for a work luncheon meeting. They were incredibly accommodating to the group, service was great, food was wonderful, and they had no issue with separate checks. Afterwards, we were trying to meet across a very long table. They offered us space upstairs, turned up the lighting and turned down the music so my team could meet. This was incredibly gracious of them. I was very impressed with the service, atmosphere, and food. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful stop that we almost didn't make. Someone posted they are closed, but that is not correct.  The restaurant had a wonderful atmosphere and the music was highly enjoyable.  The menu had some unique options which I really appreciated.  I ordered the duck confit mac and cheese. It was very satisfying and the portion was plenty.  My husband got the Icelandic cod. We tried the duck fat popcorn,  but while it was good, I wish I would have gone for the brie. We had the dragon's milk brownie sundae (substituting vanilla ice cream since we're not fans of beer). The fresh berries were a nice touch. Our waitress was helpful and friendly.  This was a nice find."}
{"text":"Charles always made sure my thirst for iced tea was quenched. Also, the fries with truffle oil, glorious."}
{"text":"Was highly recommended from my husband's massage therapist. The food was outstanding. Got  the lump crab balls and smoked house sausage as a appetizer. Both were outstanding. My husband got the smoked turkey sandwich and I went with the Chilean Seabass. Both again were outstanding. Loved our waitress Melinda, will be back and will ask for her.  Will make sure to go to this place at least once a month."}
{"text":"Oak Barrel is a solid four stars, but I don't think it will ever get to five, because the prices are just a little too high for what you get. 

I have been here at least five times now. My bf really loves it. We sat at the bar a lot, but the service is better at the tables because the bar is too big for the number of bartenders typically working. The bartenders are really nice but they just can't keep up when the bar is full. 

Some highlights from the menu are the beef burger and barbecue amish chicken pizza. I was skeptical of a pizza with peanuts on it, but it is awesome.  Skip the fish and chips as there isn't enough fish. They have a lot of good beers on tap. The atmosphere is nice. A good place to eat before or after your movie next door. 

Definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Good portions.stick with the beef and bbq products. Good stuff.

Nice selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a long time -- and finally got my chance today. 

It's a big place, cozy, with enough room between tables to feel like you've got a bit of privacy. I started with the Duck Fat Popcorn -- yummy, interesting flavors. I followed with an Oak Barrel Burger, which was nice, with the house cole slaw. Here's where it got a little schizophrenic: it was taco tuesday, my popcorn and burger were americana, but the slaw was an interesting (yes) but asian fusion thing. Not at all what I expected, not the kind of cole slaw you expect with a burger. They forgot the fries, and service was very slow. 

Was it $24 good? No, I should have gone to Fire or L'Albatros."}
{"text":"I used to bartend here and I still dream of the pomme frittes and kafta burger. Oh my god the kafta burger. It's not even 9 am and I would shamelessly dive balls deep into one of those babies.

A little note to other reviewers, from someone who spent a year on the other side: we got as frustrated with incorrect draft lists as you do, but keep in mind the vast majority of it is rotating. (Side bar, your server/bartender has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with bar stock, so if they are currently out of a beer or liquor don't take it out on them! Chances are the distributor is the one who was sold out.) I would imagine it's still pretty much the same, with the Dragon's Milk, KYBB, KY Light and hefe being staples, so that leaves 26 beers that are in and out. On busy weekends, if lists had to be updated every time a keg emptied, we'd be printing lists roughly 6 times per dinner shift. Maybe more, if Chef or Niko were able to get their hands on a 6 barrel of some rare gem. Just ask if there is anything from the on deck list available yet. Variety is the spice of life, no? :)"}
{"text":"My son,nephew and I took my mother here for her 66th birthday last week.  We really enjoyed the ambiance and the location in Valley View. There were no issues with customer service or attentiveness to our table. The only consistent discussion while reviewing the menu was the lack of options for variety or specialized Foods. For example my mom is a diabetic and gluten-free and sugar-free so it was very difficult for her.  It was disappointing to find there were no dessert options she was able to eat so she ordered what she would have liked in a sugar-free option the and the boys and I shared it for her.  For the 4 of us to eat one appetizer or dinner and one dessert was more than $170. So I would not suggest this a place for a family-type situation it is more of a date place or girls night out pregame."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the second time last weekend.  The food is fabulous! Good variety of dishes and you can tell they use fresh ingredients.  I absolutely love the pulled pork!  But I can only give them 3 stars because the service has been disappointing both times.  Definitely eat here, but don't go if you're in a rush.  We went AFTER we saw our movie!"}
{"text":"Eating out with family food was so awesome waiter Charles was freaking amazing coming back soon well worth all the money"}
{"text":"Would have been nice if there was something not fried or loaded with fat. Abstained while the rest of the table ate.  The server was excellent.  Not a beer person, but they gave samples at the bar while waiting so that was good.  Was busy at 7:30 on a Friday evening but less than half full by the time we left."}
{"text":"Found this place for dinner while traveling for work. Really good gastropub without the pretense. Food is nearly excellent, beer selection is extensive and eclectic. I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This was my first time at The Oak Barrel, which was highly recommended to me. Everything from the service to the food was excellent. We went for a late lunch and got sat right away with no wait time. We started with the calamari and stuffed eggs. The calamari is definitely shareable and was delicious. The eggs were good but heavy on the mustard (definitely depends on preference). 

After the appetizers, we both had the sunny burger which is a delicious beef burger topped with a fried egg. It was amazing. We also upgraded from their regular hand cut fries to the truffle oil Parmesan fries. Definitely worth the up charge. The portions are a great size for the price as well. 

We ended with dessert because they serve Mitchell's ice cream which is the best! 

Our server was fantastic. If I remembered her name I would definitely ask for her again. Refills were filled without asking and she made sure we enjoyed our experience. 

Love it! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Two other couples and my husband and I have a monthly \"Mystery Dinner Trip,\" where each month one couple is charged with selecting a restaurant that none of us have been to then keeping it secret until we arrive.  We try to select non-big occasion, destination-type places, rather good food, locally owned even hole-in-the-wall places. Our choice this month was The Oak Barrel. We were all happily surprised.  I called in early afternoon to try to get a reservation, but was told they didn't accept them.  However, the very friendly and helpful hostess told me she'd put us on the \"call list,\" for a 7:30 arrival.  And, true to her word when we arrived, she seated us in the bar area immediately.  While it was quiet noisy, it was OK, and the men were able to watch the end of the OSU game.  We had:
        APPETIZERS
               Onion rings
                Amish chicken wings
               Calamari
All were very good, especially the calamari which was excellent and perfectly prepared.

          MAINCOURSE:
                Pulled pork taco (2)
                Ribs
                Cuban sandwich
                Burger
                Fish and chips
Again, everyone thought their choice was really good.  I have to say the pulled pork tacos were especially delicious!

We always take a vote upon leaving: (1) Definitely will return (2) Might return if in the neighborhood (3) Meh. (4) Wouldn't come back even if someone else paid the bill.  We had 6 \"Definitely will returns\" votes.  

But I think we'll ask to be seated in the quieter room, or out on the really nice patio if it's a nice evening."}
{"text":"Second visit a bummer. Onion rings were served soggy. Brought more out
Still soggy. Bartender never asked if we would like something else. Just developed an attitude. So much for ordering anything else. Talked to
Manager on our way out."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times, and I have always received excellent food and service. I recommend the Cobb salad with shrimp and the open face pork. Delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Meat dishes pretty good. Quick service during lunch. Salads large portions. Stick with the specialties here."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I haven't eaten at the Oak Barrel. I have, however, gone 4 times for drinks at the bar. 

The decor is nice, and I like their choice of music, but the service...wow. The Oak Barrel employs some of the rudest bartenders I've ever met. At first I brushed it off and thought it was an isolated incident. However, after visiting multiple times and having terribly slow service and passive aggressive bartenders EVERY time, I think I'll go elsewhere when in the area. 

The bartenders act annoyed when you ask a question. For example, a friend asked for a black and tan, and the bartender told him no and to read the menu next time when ordering a drink. A simple, \"Sorry, we don't have the alcohol necessary\" would have sufficed. She also never came back to ask if we wanted anything else, and we sat there a full hour. 

Very disappointing, especially considering the overall good reviews on their food. Unfortunately, I'd rather go somewhere with more professional employees."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dinner yesterday.  The restaurant had a surprisingly upscale feeling to it despite it's location (movie theater parking lot next to a Quaker Steak and Lube).  They even had a patio and a fire pit going... which would have been sweet if it was just a little warmer outside.

After checking in on Yelp I realized that I was entitled to a free \"Duck Fat Popcorn\" appetizer... so we ordered that along with our drinks.  They had a GREAT beer menu.  I'm more of a stout beer drinker and they had several good stout's on the menu.

Food was very good and surprisingly cheap.  All of our bills were under $25 for two beers each plus a dinner.  I had the \"Yucatan BBQ Pork Tacos\" and they were very tasty :-P

Thinking about it more, this would be a perfect place for a date.  More character and upscale atmosphere than chain restaurants... not too expensive... and it's right next to one of the best movie theaters in Cleveland!

Overall impression: nice atmosphere, good beer menu, moderate prices, great place for a date."}
{"text":"Oak Barrel is close by work, so have been here several times for lunch and a couple times for dinner.  For lunch, I would categorize it as very good food, decent service and just OK value.  The problem is they have a \"one menu fits all\" approach with no smaller portion (and price) lunches, so portions are ridiculously large for a lunch.  The servers were good and reasonably attentive, but poorly trained. It is common for them not to remember the daily specials and mix up orders (even for tables of 2)!  It is a better value to come for dinner with a big appetite.  The parmesan crusted chicken salad is fantastic and the BBQ is great also.  I would steer clear of the fish tacos.  Not that they taste bad, but again a poor value.  you get 3 very small tacos that would barely qualify as an appetizer at a regular dinner order price."}
{"text":"Food is great, whiskey selection is great and the beer selection is great. The cost is not so great. Good spot for a fancy night out. They also recently shortened the menu a lot. Some things that were really good got dropped. Nice place though"}
{"text":"This place is terrible!!! The menu is very weak. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was cooked good but had absolutely no flavor whatsoever!! The syrup left a horrible after taste and thats the only way you taste the chicken was if you drenched it in syrup!! Will not be back...EVER!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything we got. Service was outstanding. Food was prepared perfectly. I would recommend The Oak Barrel to everyone."}
{"text":"This was a really great restaurant to stumble upon on our way to see a movie in the theater across the parking lot. They had plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, beyond just the usual salad. Our food was delicious and clearly made with high quality and from scratch; well worth the price. They also have a great draft beer list. The service and timing was perfect, we had just finished our appetizer and only a few moments later our dinners arrived. We returned after our movie for dessert and sat in the bar area and were were equally pleased with our food and the service."}
{"text":"Late lunch was a treat! Excellent waitstaff. Tomato bisque is rich and cheese bread was perfect pairing. Amish chicken tacos were a generous portion. Chicken was juicy grilled strips. Veggies were roasted and salsa was fresh. I'll come back this week."}
{"text":"Review for Tuesday Tacos. Big portion tacos and creative specialties. I had the falafel, bbq pork and shrimp. The service here is really good. I have been here twice for happy hour and once for lunch and they are very attentive and friendly, even when it is packed and you are sitting outside by the fire. They are right by the Towpath so it is a great spot to indulge after biking."}
{"text":"I have not been here in awhile (since I worked on Rockside Road), so I was happy to go again after I went on a railway tour. It was great to be back - everything was just as I remember it. The staff was super nice, the menu had a wide array of options and everything was delicious. Now, since I had last been here, I have gone to the sister restaurants, Bold and Forage, and they all have similar flavors/vibes/menus (obviously Bold is a little more upscale). So it is interesting to see the similarities/differences and compare - but there is a distinction among them that makes each unique in its own way. 

I had the bacon wrapped dates as an appetizer and split the chicken tacos with my boyfriend because neither one of us was super hungry. It was also super delicious, and the tacos had just the right amount of kick to them, so kudos to the chef."}
{"text":"Management is definitely paying attention to reviews here!  The seasonable vegetable side is now $7, but still delicious and worth it.  I also really love the mayo that comes with the fries."}
{"text":"wow! First time.... Our new favorite place! Best Ribs we ever had and the Wood fire pizza was great..Food was out before we finished our drink.... Loved the decor...Band playing outside...Sami at the bar took care of us... 

Not only was she adorable, she was very knowledgeable ... great service great time!!! Best of all we met new Friends!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, I got pulled pork (a little spicy) and my wife and daughter got lettuce tacos.  Our waitress was wonderful, very attentive.  The kitchen was very slow for our meal ( others around us got their food much more quickly).  Our bill was credited by 20% because of the slow delivery of our food, which was nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday around 1 for lunch. Never been before. I have to say that everything was astounding. I ordered the Oak Barrel Old Fashioned which was probably the best OF I've ever had, and strong. They use those round ice cubes. Fancy. Then I ordered the tomato bisque which was also some of the best I've ever had. Finally, I ordered the bacon-wrapped beef. Honestly, this was quite possibly the best prepared and tasty piece of meat I've ever eaten. Melted in my mouth quality of beef. Perfectly prepared and presented over mash with killer sauce. This restaurant is now one of my favorites in Cleveland. I will be going back as often as I can. Hats off to the chef and wait staff."}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to say \"Yay! I'm a fan\" just yet. I need to give this Deagan's reincarnate another chance first. I didn't have a bad experience there; in fact, the opposite was true. It was very good. It's just that I kind of don't trust that the menu is practically the same as Deagan's, and you guys know that Deagan's and I are culinary frenemies.

My husband went to Oak Barrel for drinks and dinner one night after work. He loved it. He's a beer nerd and any place that does beer more than half-assed will work for him. So we went back for brunch a few days later. First of all, it is kid-friendly. Good for me, not good for others I'm sure. 

The food was good, but a little over the top. I can't really explain it. It was all \"too\" something or another. Salad was too overdressed; flatbread was too oniony; beer was too expensive; salmon roulettes were too small. Nevertheless, most of my dining companions (2 year old daughter included) enjoyed their meals. In fact, her greek yogurt and berry parfait, priced at $4, was probably the best deal on the menu because it was overflowing with granola and it provided more than enough for her and the adults to share.

Like I said, I am looking forward to giving Oak Barrel a second go-round, because I LOVE the space, and I think it has great potential (and also because there is really nothing like it nearby). The location may be viewed as an obstacle by some, but I think it is an asset. Gastropubs are a dime a dozen in other more populated \"Foodie\" areas, so I think it's a refreshing addition to this random geographical location."}
{"text":"Overpriced and under-flavored.

Went through the pictures on Yelp! and found the open faced pulled pork to be very popular, so I came in for lunch to give it a try.  Service was so-so, though the waiter lacked a personality.  Ordered the sandwich and a beer.  Got the sandwich first....then the beer.

Regarding the Open Faced Pulled Pork, it was served on jalapeno corn bread, which apparently means corn that was grown near jalapenos, as there didn't seem to be any in the bread.  The onion straws on top were chewy and stale.  The slaw was mixed with lettuce for some reason, which made it taste like, lettuce.

The pork itself was OK, but nothing to write home about.  And it was way overpriced.  $15.00 for something that was worth about half that, if fresh, and this wasn't.

On a positive note, they have wi-fi, TVs, my favorite bourbons, and lots of beer on tap as long as you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"So yummy! Great place to eat. Unique menu! Friendly staff and A+++ place to meet friends. Very nice patio."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place as the owner first did some great gastropub fare at Deagan's in Lakewood.  Went here for lunch today and we left happy and full.  Inside of the place has an urban farmer-barn chic vibe with lots of dark woods and the pleasant aroma of bbq. Got their chicken and waffles and was pleasantly surprised.  Two pieces of moist chicken, a great sweet waffle on the bottom with just a dusting of powdered sugar. The blackberry syrup was great, but the dollop of Cayenne butter was uninspired.  Our server was pleasant and the host was cordial. It's a place I plan to visit again...I can still smell the bbq."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the Chicken and Waffles as it looked quite tasty. I also added a side of the macaroni and cheese. The Chicken and Waffles is delicious. The chicken was crisp and seasoned well.  The waffles were fluffly, lite and cooked very well. It was served with a maple cayenne butter syrup sauce that gave it the extra kick of scrumptiousness. The macaroni and cheese lacked in flavor. It defintely needed either seasonings or more cheese, so it was quite a disappointment, but the chicken and waffles made up where it lacked. I'd definitely eat here again and reorder the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Took my wife on a few dates here. The atmosphere is great and the food is Amazing!!! We loved every bite! Ginger beer was great to! Get the sweeter when you like it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The decor is modern, yet cozy and inviting. The duck fat popcorn is the best popcorn I've ever tasted. The chicken tacos were really good, too. A lot of stuff on the menu sounded delicious. My husband got the sunny side burger (egg & bacon on it) and said it was one of the best he's ever had."}
{"text":"Great menu selections, quick service, delicious food (the sunny side burger and the soft pretzel appetizer were both amazing), and nice place both inside and out on the patio. They even have cornhole out front! Would come back again."}
{"text":"My extended family and I came here last week to celebrate my birthday.  They do not take reservations (except for much larger parties), but we were seated immediately as a table of eight.  This Gastropub has an extensive beer and cocktail menu and the Founders Stout i ordered was so good that my wife even ordered one after her first drink was finished.

My wife and I did our usual dining thing, sharing a bunch of dishes.  We ordered a Bavarian pretzel appetizer, side salad, mussels and a half-rack of their baby back ribs.

The pretzel came out first.  It was cooked to a deep golden brown color and came with two dipping options...a spicy mustard and a gruyere cheese fondue.  I am partial to a more traditional cheddar-type cheese to dip a pretzel in, so I did not enjoy the gruyere version as much...but the mustard was spot on and paired great with both the pretzel and my Stout beer.

My wife really seemed to enjoy both her side salad as well as the mussels.  They were stewed in a beer broth (loaded with garlic) and served with fries, blue cheese crumbles and fresh tomatoes.  The mussels may have been slightly overcooked, but the flavors in the dish melded very well together.

My baby back ribs were as expected...fall-off-the-bone tender with a slightly sweet and smoky sauce served with crispy fries and a really unique (and slightly spicy) cole slaw.  I prefer to \"work\" at getting the meat off a rib bone, but i knew how these were going to be prepared and enjoyed them as they were.

My brother-in-law ordered one of their \"signature\" dishes...the Dr. Pepper pork shank.  He was nice enough to let me sample, and it may have been the best dish I had there!  It was incredibly tender and had a really unique flavor due to the braising in the cola liquid.

Since it was my birthday, they brought out a flourless chocolate torte to celebrate...it was rich, delicious and decadent topped with caramel bacon crumbles.  A great finish to a very nice meal and enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Met up here last night for a dinner date. This was my first time here and I was surprised at how packed it was on a cold, windy Tuesday night. Perhaps because it was \"Taco Tuesday\"?

Got a pager and sat at the only available seat at the bar to wait for a table to open up. The host had said 45 minutes but I don't think the wait was that long. Despite the crowd, the bartender was prompt to take and serve the drinks and was very attentive. 

At the table, the server took our order right away and the drinks and food came out quickly. I ordered three of the tacos: chicken, tuna, and shrimp. They are generously sized soft tacos and I had a hard time deciding which variety I liked the best. Probably a tie between the tuna and the shrimp. I will certainly return for Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"500 stars for the duck fat popcorn. Sweet lord, that popcorn is good. If you're cool with splurging on calories, order the duck fat popcorn. 

I've been to The Oak Barrel a few times in the past few months, and am generally pretty impressed. It's fairly casual dining in a very nice space, and is rather pricey if you're doing drinks and entrees, but the food has been solid. 

We've sat at the bar a few times, and the service at the bar is spotty when it's busy (which it always has been). The bartenders are swamped and are hustling for sure, so it's not for lack of their effort.  Table service was decent/no complaints. 

The food has impressed me. Excellent pulled pork tacos, grilled shrimp cobb salad, pizza, etc. there's so many thing I want to try on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm here a year later.  A lot has changed.  Drinks still good, service still good.  Food is decent.  I must've been here a dozen times since first review.  I can't wait to try some new menu items.  Too bad my original server doesn't work here anymore.  Boo hiss.  
Bring it oak barrel!"}
{"text":"Just love the food!  Great tacos; pulled pork is my favorite.  Great calamari and wings. I haven't had anything I would not order again."}
{"text":"A family favorite!  We have never had bad service or bad food. But what I like the best is the quality of the food.  And that comes with a price. Our grandchildren love the mac 'n cheese which I have to say is delicious.  Here's what we enjoyed on this visit:

Grandkids - Jr Fried Tenders with side of fruit, Jr Mac 'n Cheese with side of fruit, and a Jr Cheeseburger.  Beautiful chunks of pineapple, strawberries, cantaloupe and honeydew.  Again, you pay for that kind of quality sides for kids.  Only took home some fruit and some mac 'n cheese.  

Hubby - Plead the 5th draft beer with 1/2 slab of baby back ribs.  They were great with french fries and cole slaw.  I snagged some of the crispy fries.  YUM.

I had the chicken chopped salad which was too large to eat the whole thing.  Picked the best stuff out and left behind some lettuce.  Chocked full of chicken, hard boiled egg, cucumbers, chickpeas, tomatoes, etc.  Just lightly dressed which is how I like it.

Rounding out our $70 meal before tip, was a hot tea and a Jr Milk."}
{"text":"Music was a bit loud for dinning we felt like we where in a pub because of it. Food was good, although the cuban sandwich was a far cry from a sandwich. A simple bolonga and cheese sandwich would have been better. Over all service, food, atmosphere.... Not bad."}
{"text":"I love the openness of the lobby. Makes the wait a little more tolerable. Had they put as much effort into having adequate seating (amount and quality), that would seal the deal with that....however the couches are dismal.

On arrival, they tried to get us to sit at the bar or barside or on the patio (heated but still). No thanks. Then again. No thanks. Not our style. A little annoying.

We were seated in due time (not quickly but whatever) and were sat next to a table of people obviously not use to hanging out with one another and/or drinking. The one lady was the loudest, most annoying, most anger-inducing person I'd ever had the pleasure of sitting near in a restaurant....I'm 37 and semi-well-traveled....so that's something.  

The waitress eventually asked if we wanted to move, which we did. The food was good enough in the end. The service timeliness was not good and considering there were 1 billion staffers on deck, that is not excusable. 

May go again for a second try but time will tell. Wouldn't go out of my way, however."}
{"text":"Food and service are very good.  Open faced pulled pork BBQ and short ribs are exceptional and favorites.  Big Greens salads with chicken are large and tasty but $15 for a salad is too high. Even the small salads are up there.  $7 for a house salad!  This is the only complaint.  Otherwise, great food."}
{"text":"Duck confit Mac n cheese is amazing. 
Great customer service. 
I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"The food quality here has majorly gone downhill. I ordered the herb crusted chicken salad. No joke---it was tasteless.  No flavor, no salt, no nothing. To make matters worse, the alleged Apple cider Vinaigrette dressing that came with it was overloaded with onions, and it had a weird, creamy white appearance. Total miss.  My friends got the tacos and said they were okay.  Overpriced bland food.  I won't go back.  What a shame."}
{"text":"We visited The Oak Barrel on a Saturday night. It was busy - there were 20-30 people awaiting seating in the lobby and bar area. Nonetheless, we were seated in about 30 minutes as promised when we came in. The menu is imaginative and an interesting read - Duck Fat Popcorn and Duck Confit Mac and Cheese stood out as interesting takes on every day foods. We went with the Baked Brie appetizer, served with fresh berries, local honey and quince paste.and some nice crusty Bruschetta. We also tried a mead which was a nice departure from the typical adult beverage and not usually found in restaurants. Our entrees were the Amish Chicken and Waffles and the Dr Pepper Braised Pork Shank, The chicken was surprisingly juicy and cooked perfectly. The waffle was good; nothing stood out about it but the blackberry maple syrup was a delicious addition. The Pork Shank was served with roasted garlic whipped potatoes and soy chile jam. It was fall apart tender, delicious and a large portion.

It was honestly tough to eat all of the food that was served - the portions were large -  and the bill with drinks came to under $60 for the two of us pre-tip, a very reasonable evening. There is a children's menu as well and we see no reason not to bring our children there the next time we visit."}
{"text":"Had 2 taco dishes. First one were the shrimp tacos. The shrimp was basically non existent. It's was cheesy and hardly no taste. The steak fajitas were served raw and grizzly. Bad choice. I did receive a full refund and the staff was courteous. I doubt if I will ever return."}
{"text":"For bar. I ate here when it first opened and all i remeber was service so poor I didnt want to come back. This time my friend told me he wanted to come sample beers for beer week. He told me a different restaurant name, so I thought we where going somewhere else. I was excited to see their beer selection.  We ordered a beer to share while reading the beer list and dinner menu. Staff friendly at first,  then blatently ignored us at the bar after delivering the beer. They ignored us even after an older gentleman (manager? ) pointedly asked one of them to help us. That bar tender finished what she was doing and left without a glance in our direction.  Two other bar tenders chatted and counted their tips. Finally one came over to ask if we needed anything. 30 minutes after our beer. I can imagine how it would have gone after that. We asked for the check.  We where going to order dinner and had decided on several beers to try. We left and went elsewhere for beer and dinner. Probably not going back. Owner:train your staff better or you will fail eventually.  The bar was pretty empty. There are too many other places that have a great beer list to treat customers like this."}
{"text":"Really really nice place...great selection of beers on tap (25 or so) along with 20 plus bourbons.  Pulled pork stack was awesome...duck fat popcorn - no need to say more on that.  Nice atmosphere as well.  Will come again soon."}
{"text":"I have come here several times to eat and always enjoyed my meals. The restaurant is pretty large with a cozy, modern but rustic atmosphere. They have a nice bourbon selection, and ever changing draft list.
I have eaten a variety of meals here, chicken and waffles and the croque monsieur pizza which I enjoyed. Plus the various meals of my fiance, that I have assisted in finishing, have all been delicious, but what truly earned this place the 5th star is the last meal I had, the open faced pulled pork BBQ.
Usually I am not a fan of open faced sandwiches, but this one definitely peaked my interest. They chose to use jalapeño cornbread instead of regular bread. The pulled pork was very tender with excellent flavor and pulled apart with ease. The slaw was tasty, but the fried, crunch onions were my favorite addition to the sandwich.
The sandwiches here are pretty reasonably priced. The dinners go from fair prices to a little elevated, but the food is worthy of the price. Usually I always like to try a variety of options at any restaurants, but the open faced pulled pork BBQ was so good, I have found a regular selection around here."}
{"text":"Awesome patio.  They have covered outdoor seating then basically an outdoor lounge in the sun.  We were seated inside for lunch on Taco Tuesday.  We were excited to try a variety of tacos.  Green tea was tasty, possibly a touch over-brewed.  My husband tried the Goya Ginger Beer and loved it.  

My beef sadly is the wait.  We waited about 30 minutes for tacos.  On Taco Tuesday.  Really?  And my husband's chicken taco was missing the chicken!  How hard can it be to assemble nine tacos?  

Anyway, they were good.  My favorite would be the pork taco.  The tuna was good, but I didn't even taste the tuna until the very last bite.  The sweet sauce was overpowering.  The shrimp was ok but had a bit too much of the spicy mayo and wasn't very pretty to look at.  I've completely forgotten what the last one was, so I guess it wasn't that great.

I love the menu, though I'm sad they don't have pizza anymore.  I would love to give them another chance and hope for faster service!"}
{"text":"This place is great! They have excellent drinks and the food is interesting. The menu has some unique items and everything I've had there was great!"}
{"text":"first, let's get the slight negatives out of the way...
i don't get the appeal of the Duck Fat Popcorn. it wasn't bad at all, i just didn't find it as awesome as everyone else seems to. also, our waitress seemed a little out of her comfort zone. eventually things got better but she seemed so timid and unsure of herself we were, at first, a little worried.
with that out of the way, let's get to the good to great...
Danielle had the Chicken & Waffles which she loved. She let me try it and i thought it was great too. i got the Dr. Pepper Braised Pork Shank with a glass of water and a 6 oz. B. Nektar Zombie Killer (mead). INCREDIBLY GOOD. the mead was a bit expensive but damned good and the pork shank was one of the best dinners i've had in ages. i look forward to going back again. You should too."}
{"text":"I was looking for a spot to have a quick dinner and The Oak Barrel was \"on the way\" to my destination. Saw it had pretty good reviews, so I decided to give this place a try!

The building has a very nice rustic, outdoorsy, ranch feel to it. You feel right at home with the fire pit on and giving this warm ambiance. The interior has some pretty cool decorations of the barrels and warm dim lights.

Let's talk about food. Probably one of my favorite American food restaurants for small shareable plates in my book. We didn't order a lot, but each item was delicious!

Arugula salad: I'm a big fan. The ingredients in this salad is so fresh and the candied walnuts are so yummy. I was thrown off by the shallot vinaigrette as it came in this thick, green color, but I really want this dressing recipe now because it took a typical salad to a whole different level. 

Devils on Horseback: SO DELICIOUS! i've never had medjool dates before but these were so delicious. I actually dislike bacon, and these were wrapped in it. Something magical happened bc when you took a bite in these things, there was this perfect balance of the dates, subtle bacon taste, and some sweet and spicy glaze. I would definitely eat bacon again for this dish.

Baked Brie: LOVED. The brie comes baked in a pastry wrap, which is something I've never seen and I loved it. The pastry is perfectly golden brown and adds that crisp texture to the melted cheese. You can't ever go wrong with baked brie... but that pastry wrap was yums!

Duck Fat Popcorn: tip--toss the popcorn once you get it! All that duck fat is sitting at the bottom and so you gotta toss it a bit more in order for the flavor to reach the top portion. This was very tasty and a nice snack for the table!

That's all we ordered. Everything was a win in my book.

Service was great, nothing wrong there. I would definitely come back again and try other shareable plates!"}
{"text":"Love this place - huge menu so give yourself plenty of time to see all of you options. My favorite dish is the Mahi Tacos. You will not be disappointed with whatever you order."}
{"text":"Kudos to these guys for taking a risk in an area where the residents are so underexposed they consider Champps exciting, and to the other reviewers that said no one will go, wrong. I was there on a Tuesday and the place was 70% occupied.  It's not that they are narrow minded, it's just that it is not offered.  I'm glad the folks there now have a decent option and I have somewhere to drink and dine before a film.  Interesting menu, good service and great beer list."}
{"text":"The first time I went here with my parents, the food and service was great and I enjoyed my meal. We had the crispy calamari as our appetizer and that was good. The second time, I visited with my husband and we were sat at a table and not greeted for at least 5 minutes and it wasn't busy. When our server finally made his way over to us and took our drink order, he didn't seem too interested. A little later, a group of 4 people were seated near us and our server greeted them with enthusiasm and asked for what they wanted for appetizers. We wanted appetizers, but we had to ask him because he thought we only wanted to order dinner. We had the onion rings as an appetizer and they were good, but they didn't really stand out. For dinner, the fish and chips was nice and my husband did like his Amish chicken. Ultimately, the service is what caused this review to be less than 4 stars."}
{"text":"I wish there were separate rankings for food and service. The food is out of this darned world amazing. The service was horrifyingly bad. We've spoken to others and they say that their experience is always the same as ours. We went with our teenage son and they seemed disappointed that we didn't want to sit at the bar...even though the dining room had plenty of open spots. It is a 25 minute drive for us. If the service matched the food, we'd make that trip happily. Sadly, it does not."}
{"text":"Me and my wife stopped in here had dinner after being on the road all day, very tasty! Good beer selection. My wife had the duck mac n cheese i had the bacon chicken sandwhich! Mmm check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I got the lamb burger and it was PHENOMENAL. However, the hostess and manager were absolutely rude and disrespectful. We called and had a reservation at 6 o'clock, and at 6:20 they told us we would have to wait another 30 minutes before getting seated. Upon arrival our name was even scratched off the list. We somehow got blamed as the bad guy when it was clearly their mistake. Multiple dirty looks from the nasty hostess. Horrid service, amazing food and atmosphere. Those two deserve to be fired as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Just got back from after work drinks at the Oak Barrel. I don't think I will be going back. The beer prices are RIDICULOUS. Mind you, it was my fault for not looking at the prices but who would have thought a pint of beer would have cost $13. For a pint of beer. Really. That equals about a $400 profit for that keg of beer.
The space is nice, pleasant, yet another \"lodge\". Our server was attentive and perfectly fine. Much like previous posts the food is good but the menu is pretty much a duplicate of the Deagan's menu. The calamari is still excellent, the pork rillette was good but basically pulled BBQ pork and not pork rillette, the dates were good although $8 for 3 bacon wrapped dated is a bit crazy. When I pointed this out to the manager/chef he stated they were so expensive because of the bacon and cheese. Well since haloumi cheese retails at abour $6.99 a pound and you only need a half slice of bacon per date I thought that was a pretty lame reason. Perhaps this is why the restaurant was half full at 7:30 on a Friday night and there were 10 servers standing around.
I did speak with the manager/chef about the beer prices and he told me that if you went anywhere else in the city the beer mark ups would be the same. Well that seems like a crock to me as I go to the Beer Engine, Lizardville and Fat Heads fairly regularly.  I hope the Oak Barrel gets it together as it is nice to have a \"not chain\" in the Independence area but If they don't I predict they will be gone in less than a year. Perhaps the manager/chef should be overseeing the wait staff and kitchen rather that drinking with family or friends in the bar."}
{"text":"Met friends up here last eve for dinner and a few beers. Been meaning to hit this place, so this gave me an excuse... figures I pick a night when we are having a Spring blizzard.

Anyway, like the space, it is comfortable. The service was good if a bit too enthusiastic. Beer list was above average and the food menu was eclectic. The food I had was not great; the fish was bland. The app I ordered was good... duck fat popcorn. Wife had the ribs and they were ok. The friends we were with enjoyed theirs.

Overall a good place, but I made the mistake of sitting in the bar area and it was too loud with a band jamming. I prefer quiet most of the time, especially when I'm having dinner. That was my fault though as I knew they were setting up. i will also add that the prices weren't average, they were on the high side. My wife and I had two dinners, an app and three total brews at a cost of 101 dolla, including tip."}
{"text":"Great food horrible service. Had a table of 12- we were here almost three hours and when we asked where our checks were after 20 mins of waiting we were told it \"takes time for separate checks\".  With that- one girl had a drink on her tab she never got. The food was amazing though I had the bbq print tacos. Waitress seemed annoyed we asked for anything and then gave us a 20% gratuity."}
{"text":"Very good food. Probably not a place for the picky eater. It's regular food \"classy-fied\" with fresh, local produce and lots of flavor. Taco Tuesday is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Warm lighting. Open patio has potential.I'm looking forward to returning when it's warmer. 

Loved the pickled vegetables.
The Arugula flat bread was nice and garlicky and BIG. We both took some home to our husbands rave reviews. 
We split the greek wedge salad which was also very good. It was large. Easily a meal on it's own with a big wedge of romaine, olives, feta, tomatoes. and a really flavorful green dressing. 
The frites were excellent. Shaved parmesan with a little rosemary. Hand cut potatoes. Yum. I'm a fried potato connoisseur and these get my vote. 
Wait staff was helpful and accommodating when I mentioned I was vegetarian. They can sub or edit a many of dishes.  They had some leftover seitan from taco Tuesday they were willing to sub in a dish or whip me up a stir fry. Nice.
Portions were a good size. My friend and I split everything and we had some leftover. The menu had a vegan option, but I i didn't see any veg options in the tacos or entrees but like I said, they were willing to accommodate. 

We were both really impressed with the drink list. Lost of excellent beers on draft and we appreciated the 5 oz option. We love beer and we love to sample. I ordered the Oak Barrel Aged manhattan just to check out the round ice cubes I read about. My drink looked huge with a softball sized ice cube in the middle. It was a solid and stiff drink but at the $13 price I only had one. 
Service was really great. My water glass was never empty.

I really enjoyed this place. I've never been to what is was before but I do like what they done with the place. Lots of greys and the picture by our table was a huge drawing of pickled and canned veggies! It was like the table was meant for us! (we love canning)
I like having a place like this on my side of town. This would be great for a date or meeting with friends. They had a nice fireplace in the middle.Win!"}
{"text":"Have been here three times now and it's a great spot for dinner, drinks and small plates. The staff is always nice and attentive. The food is great-pizzas, tacos, salads and desserts have always been fresh, served promptly and tasty. Great selection of beers and wine as well. Definitely a good spot to check out!"}
{"text":"Our overall experience was enjoyable.  We were on a date night so had no concern for time.  We spent as much time talking with the couple we dined with as we did eating.  We were never rushed by staff or felt pressured.  The place is huge so they're not pressed for seating.  The atmosphere was great and the menu had a nice mix of items.  

Our table loved the entrees: pulled pork, pork shanks, lamb burger and cheese burger.  Entree portions and prices were in line with the the experience.  The beer/wine/whiskey selection was great and also appropriately priced for the experience.

Now the negative:  They have room to improve in the appetizers and speed of drinks from the bar.  The apps were way to small for the price.  You shouldn't charge $12 for (3) bacon wrapped dates.  There weren't enough for our table of four.   The alcohol drinks ordered consistently took too long to come from the bar.  I'm sure we would have ordered more drinks if they came faster.  Bar or waiter not sure who to blame?  The deserts were very good but small portions, sorry don't remember the prices?

OVERALL:  This is a great place to dine!  We loved the atmosphere we were treated great and will return.  Just skip the appetizers they aren't needed anyhow."}
{"text":"2nd time here. Very good food. Great beer selection. Just had mediocre service. Spent just a little under 2 hours here and the server only came to 1) take drink orders 2) bring drinks and take food order 3) initially ask how everything was and 4) brought our check. Never ask if we wanted a 2nd beer or refills for those not drinking beer. If I'm the owner this blows my mind. In the amount of time we were there we all could have 3 beers. 5 of us times 2 x $6 average that comes to $60 more on the bill and probably an extra 10 to 12 bucks in the server's pocket. I will continue to go back but will hope to get better service next time."}
{"text":"The east coast oysters were good.
The waitress was fair and not very friendly or attentive.
Atmosphere was excellent.
No wait on a Saturday evening at 7:00."}
{"text":"I searched for a restaurant for my friends bachelorette party that was unique, that could be \"fancy\", and that was affordable for all of the girls. The Oak Barrel was the perfect place! It was located about 10 minutes from the house we rented for the weekend and it was very easy to find. There was adequate parking for the restaurant and the rustic features drew us right in the door. 

We were seated at a long, rectangular table right in front of a fireplace that had additional seating for other guests at the opposite end of where we were seated. A unique concept but one that is becoming more and more popular. We started off with drinks and because they were so busy, it took quite awhile to receive them; however, we were not in a rush and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. The menu contained a variety of items that I wanted to try and it was difficult to narrow it down to one! Just by reading the menu, it was obvious that this restaurant focuses on fresh, natural foods that are of high quality. I decided on The Clubhouse which contained a variety of meats and cheeses with a side of chips and homemade pickles. My sandwich was delicious, chips were average, and the girls reported that the pickles were fabulous! Everyone else's dishes looked divine and we all agreed that the restaurant was a wonderful choice! Prices are on the higher side but the quality of food lives up to them. 

The only downfall I have to report is that several weeks before the bachelorette party, I called and asked if I could make reservations because I had a group of 10 people. I was told that, if I call the week before, I could reserve the table. So, I did as directed and the next person I reached said that if I call about a half hour before we want to be there, we can have a table reserved. Again, as directed, I did just that. This time I was told that they do not take reservations unless the group is much larger than 10. After explaining what I was previously told, she took my name but did not guarantee a table would be waiting for us. When we showed up, a table was ready and waiting. I would suggest that the staff is educated on what the restaurant's policy is: reservations - yes or no? To this day, I am uncertain. 

The rustic decor, inviting atmosphere, and fresh food will definitely serve as reasons for me to return to this restaurant if I am ever in the area again. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Arrived expecting a nice evening out.  Restaurant was 3/4 empty and we were offered a high top in the bar.  Then we were seated between 2 dirty tables.  We were then moved to a section with multiple screaming children.   They said they were not opening the other part of the restaurant.   We watched as others were seated in the unopened section.   We asked to move a 3rd time.  Ordered drinks and kettle chips.  They were not home made.  Cole slaw was too spicy.  Ribs were ok.  Manager walked around useless    Could have helped his staff"}
{"text":"My son calls this place \"Gods Kitchen\" all of the food is absolutely amazing!!! Dr pepper pork shank, lamb burger is to die for the chicken and waffles and you absolutely have to try the Amish chicken wings!! Everything's fantastic! My waiter Charles was great as well he's waited on us several times now and it's always a great experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, and I'm giving just 3 stars for 3 reasons: 1. Limited vegetarian options, and my sweetheart is a vegetarian; 2. Limited gluten-free options (hint: serving a sandwich without bread doesn't really count); and 3. Our waitress knew very little about the menu. 

That said, the steak special was delicious. The deviled eggs and Devils on horseback were also quite tasty. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals, and service was responsive and friendly. The chicken wings looked fantastic but very sticky. I sampled the calamari, and it was beautifully prepared. 

It was a pleasant atmosphere with comfy seating. Oddly, the music was at a good level for conversation when we arrived, but was turned up in the middle of the meal, making conversation harder."}
{"text":"My husband and decided to take a friend to this restaurant on a Saturday evening.  We had talked to a lot of people how nice and friendly this restaurant was.  Last night there was a huge difference.  Of we understand that on a Saturday night and the bar is busy.  They did have three bartenders.  Both my husband and I went up to an open spot at the bar and all three bartenders completely ignored us.  We stood there for about 20 minutes.  The female bartender then came out from the bar to get a bottle of liquor behind me in the glass case.  She looked right at me and didn't smile or say excuse me at all.  She 100% ignored us.  We were embarrassed about how much we had talked up this restaurant to our friends.  We told the hostess that we understood they were busy but we were upset that they didn't even acknowledge us by saying something like I'll be with you soon.  The hostess try to give us a voucher for dinner and we refused.  Not spending my  dollars or time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My mom and I had dinner at the Oak Barrel Restaurant last week. We were pleasantly surprised because we thought the other restaurant (Hoagies) still existed. We are so grateful for the Oak Barrel instead! Service excellent! Food fabulous! I had the traditional burger, but with the sweet potato fries with brown sugar! Yum! My mother had the Amish Chicken and Sausage with garlic mashed potatoes and the best roasted root vegetables ever! Topped off with delicious key lime pie! Go and check this restaurant out tonight!!"}
{"text":"Excellent meals... A very surprisingly good Cuban sandwich!  The place looks and smells terrific, very welcoming.  Good music and a great selection of whisky, bourbon and blends.  A fabulous place if you want to have dinner by a fire!"}
{"text":"Hi Help Community!! Today ill review the Oak Barrel. To be completely honest we where not here to eat at this restaurant. We were here to see a movie. But we pasted by this place and decided to take on the adventure!! We were happily surprised when we so the menu! Everything looked delicious and guess what? Everything WAS delicious!! I come from a big city so I guess I would have liked a faster service. But for good food am willing to wait.!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting this place to be as good as I thought. I saw the name and automatically thought of cracker barrel, nothing like it though. I had the lobster roll which was just as good if not better than some of the ones I had while I lived in Maine! cozy atmosphere, although the tables where we sat could be further away from each other. Wait staff was awesome:)"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a stop through town. The menu and ambience looked attractive. They also have a nice patio to sit outside, albeit in a parking lot. The overall positive aspects were fast service on a Saturday night, fresh ingredients and tasty flavors. However, the ribs were over cooked and chewy. While the mussels were hit or miss with some not really hot and the accompanying fries completely soaked in the broth. I'd have preferred to get them on the side and not buried underneath the shells."}
{"text":"My in-laws introduced me to this place, and we are all hooked. Every time I am in the Cleveland area (roughly 6 times per year,) we always come as a big family group. The atmosphere is lovely, the service is usually very good, and the food is GREAT. I am a huge fan of the chicken & waffles and the duck fat popcorn. My husband usually gets the pulled pork, but our table is always full of satisfied guests with a range of different foods. They have a good selection of food and an even bigger selection of beer. This is one of my favorite restaurants by far!"}
{"text":"Went before a movie. Location is great, same  plaza as the theatre. Our waitress was amazing , super nice and engaging. The food was good. We shared the onion ring appetizer. They are giant rings, incredibly hot and fresh. And good seasoning on the batter. I had the duck confit Mac and cheese. This dish was decent, not as good as it sounds. It was a little greasy. It came with a salad on the plate. My friend had the chicken and waffles and really enjoyed it. It is a large place so we were seated quickly. They have a large beer list. It was good for what it is. Next time I go to a movie I would go back."}
{"text":"Best Burger! The pork shank and pulled pork are fantastic as well.  Our waitress Brittany was very kind, and the manager Mary we met was genuine and competent.  This was our 5th successful visit and I plan on going back again soon."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat after a fun ride on the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad and the Oak Barrel is just a few minutes from the Independence stop.  The atmosphere is nice, and the double-sided fireplace in the middle of the restaurant was a welcome addition on a chilly Saturday.  

The menu has a good, well-priced selection of apps, pizzas, burgers, sandwiches and entrees.  I had the Croque Monsier pizza and it was delicious!  And huge!  I could have easily split the pizza with someone else -- but then I wouldn't have had the leftovers I enjoyed the next day!.  My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and said it was very tasty.

The service was good, but a little intrusive.  The server first asked us for our order about two minuets after we sat down and then again about a minute after that.  It was early (around 4:30 pm) so maybe she didn't have enough tables to keep her busy.  But that's a minor complaint and I'm sure we'll be back if we find ourselves in Valley View again."}
{"text":"Was glad to see that a new place finally took over the old Hoggys.  I believe the owners are calling this place a Gastropub which I understand means bar food done in a more inspired and more expensive way.  Although the place is quite large it still has a cozy feel.  Beer selection is extensive and tremendous and I like the fact that you can order draft beers in three different sizes priced accordingly.  Went with my wife and two sons and one of their friends aged 16, 16 and 20 sat at a high top in the bar.  Only glitch was there seemed to be some confusion between the hostess and the bartenders as to who was supposed to wait on us...once the bartender realized it was up to her she was friendly and effiecient.   16 year old son ordered chicken and waffles...thought it was good but perhaps a bit pricy at $18.  His buddy ordered a flat bread pizza which looked great was very tasty and I thought fairly priced at $10...Older son and wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich served open faced atop what I believe was a corn fritter.  I thought it was a nice presentation and a nice portion and I liked the smoky taste...my wife thought it was too spicy but she has very low tolerance for anything spicy..  I opted for the Cuban....decent I prefer it served on a more traditional pressed bun than the bread they served it on.  Sorry I don't remember the prices on the Cuban and pulled pork I believe they were in the 11 to $12 range.   All in all I enjoyed it.  Loved the feel of the bar area and the great selection of beers and wines.  I found the menu contained enough unique items and twists on traditional items that would encourage me to go back.  It's not cheap eats though...you'd have to decide for yourself if the food justifies the price.  My wife was not a huge fan so you married guys know what that means....prob a place I will just have to hit with my buds or co workers."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few days ago with my husband. We went in early before the dinner rush was at it's peak. The ambiance was lovely and we had high hopes. But everything went downhill from there. The food came and it seemed kinda tasteless. My husband got dry, boring ribs. I had a burger that was kind of cold, I've had tastier burger from fast food joints. Our server Kyle was okay... He seemed a little dazed. Hate to say it, but he almost seemed high. Service was very uneven. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Would come back anytime! Much more modern of a menu than the restaurants name suggests."}
{"text":"This is the best place to unwind in the evenings or weekends! And it's right next to the theatre to catch a movie. There is very rarely a wait because it's such a big place with seating upstairs, main dining room, bar area, and the patio. They have a quickly rotating draft selection to keep things interesting with options to get a smaller pour to test any of the beers before fully committing. 
I had my friend with celiac disease visiting and she went here the first night she was in town. After that she didn't want to try anywhere else. Their gluten free menu is huge and it's so nice they have it on their website including precise directions for substitutions for many items. 
Then another time a while back I brought a coworker of my husband's who is a meat grilling and smoking connoisseur (has one of those green eggs and even smokes brisket all winter in Minnesota). He got the baby back ribs and gave them his full approval. I found out now he brings his clients here every time he's in town.
This is one of those places where I take forever to figure out what to order. I'm torn between sticking to a tried and true and venturing out. But everything is really good. I  had the grilled shrimp cobb salad last time and have been thinking about how soon I can go back and get it again. Shrimp can be tricky, but these were perfectly poppy and warm. 
Great service, atmosphere, food, drink! If you check-in on Yelp, you get a free duck fat popcorn too!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new place out in a city we hadn't been to prior to this.
Restaurant had a great atmosphere and hadn't gotten busy yet due to the time we arrived.

Waitress was good although she could have had a little more personality and the food was decent. Not over the top but also not horrible, just mediocre.

If there was one improvement I would suggest is to explain a little more on the menu about what eqch individual item is. Seemed very basic and had to ask what things were."}
{"text":"We had a big group of 11 and they did a great job accommodating us. The food was unique and excellent. We ordered a lot if ribs and the pork shank. Outstanding."}
{"text":"We we're visiting from out of town. Five stars for the following: 

-customer service was through the roof.
-food was amazing! Well seasoned and cooked perfectly. All the food was from a local farm and you could tell simply from the taste
- beer selection is superb
-atmosphere is good as well

Come here and eat! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has the Best Food...the ambiance is comforting...and the portions are the Right size...impeccable Staff..."}
{"text":"One night after watching a movie at the Cinemark theater, my friend and I stopped by the Oak Barrel. Being relatively new to Cleveland, this restaurant has been bookmarked for a few months but each time we come for a movie, we don't have time for dinner before, or the restaurant is closed because it's a little late. It's safe to say, I was pretty excited to make it in, finally! 

Upon entering, it kind of reminded me of a barn, maybe that's the theme? Either way, it's cute and has a comfortable vibe. It was about 9pm, fairly still busy, but that didn't slow down service. It's clean, and I don't think I've ever mentioned a restaurants restroom in any of my reviews BUT I really loved this one, it's so darn cute! (BE SURE TO CHECK IT OUT). Our waitress was sweet and attentive but not overwhelmingly so. I ordered a burger and fries, I can't remember which one specifically, but it was just OK for me, nothing I've never had or over the top. My friend ordered the falafel tacos and seemed to really enjoy them. Good drinks too, some aren't on the menu so be sure to ask as they can make something custom for you, a definite plus! 

Prices are average, portions are fairly sized, presented with beautiful atmosphere and, paired with great company, makes for a wonderful evening. 

We really enjoyed our time there and I'd come back again, especially if it's a day where I am nearby at the movies."}
{"text":"Came here with the family after seeing a movie at Valley View Cinemas.  Really nice meal.  Pretty nice bar menu and good variety of food without an expansive menu.  Had the lamb burger, italian pizza, big tex salad and kids mac and cheese.  Everything tasted great.  Service was prompt and very courteous.  Overall very happy with the meal and will be back again to try other things."}
{"text":"I just tried this restaurants food for the first time and I would definitely go back.  I have been up to the bar a time or two which I always enjoyed as it is separate from the restaurant so you do not feel like you are bothering people who are eating.  

I tried the truffle fries as an appetizer and they were delicious.  They had fresh seasonings and cheese on top of the home made fries and all of us absolutely loved it.  They came with a garlic aoli which really complemented the flavor.  I liked that the menu had a lot of option you could get a sandwich, burger or tacos but then also can have a nice larger dinner should you choose. 

I got the spicy shrimp tacos and they were delicious.  It was not an over powering flavor that you were really able to enjoy each bite.  They were not extremely spicy either, so you didnt need to take a sip of water after every bite.  One friend got the tuna tacos and another got the burger and both raved about their meals. 

All of our drinks were very nicely made, and when one friend didnt like her beer they took it back and gave her another at no cost which was extremely kind.  The wait staff was attentive and made sure we had water and drinks at all time.  I would definitely go back on my way to a movie or for a date."}
{"text":"Literally every time I come here, I'm beyond impressed. Hidden (or not so) gem of Cleveland. Amish chicken wings are to die for. Ribs are amazing. Very friendly and quick services."}
{"text":"Solid meal! We came here for dinner before catching a late movie and boy was it packed! We got some drinks at the bar while we were waiting for our table, and they have a mighty impressive beer selection! Also, we saw on the boards that takeout beer and wine is 20% off?? And they sell cigars???? With these perks, no wonder this place was hopping. The food was also very good. We had to try the duck fat popcorn because of the hype, and it was tasty as expected. I got the Ohio burger- awesome with a hefty side of fries! Overall, this place did not disappoint, and it was worth the wait for us!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch, saw they did tacos and ordered the ahi tuna tacos which I inquired if they came on corn tortillas and was told they did. Sadly when they arrived they were on flour tortillas which if I would have known I would have ordered something else.

Tacos were decent once you got past the fact that they used gringo tortillas. Staff really should have known this.

Just a little follow up, reached out to the owner after the below message and two weeks after that still no contact by the restaurant as she said would occur. With that I changed this from three stars to two."}
{"text":"Glad to see that a new restaurant is open close to work.  Went during lunch with a co-worker.  She had shrimp tacos; I had the carne asada tacos.  Both were delicious and perfect for lunch.  Atmosphere was nice and warm.

My only complaint was the server.  I had asked her about the concept of the restaurant (farm to table, scratch kitchen, etc.), and she didn't seem to understand.  Another server was explaining to her table about using farm fresh produce, Amish chicken, fresh beef, beer selection, etc.  Glad I was able to overhear that.  It was their first week open, so I hope by now she has a clue.

Also, my friend order shrimp tacos and received pork.  You'd think they would have been refired right away, but we had to wait another 20 minutes for her food, which put us way over our lunch hour.

Hoping it was just opening bumps in the road, so I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"Super yummy chicken and waffles! The spicy butter with the black berry maple syrup! Great beer selection. Great pulled pork open face sandwich. It had a nice spice to it."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3 and 3.5 stars.  My first visit to the Oak Barrel, after attending an afternoon movie nearby.  Based on the reviews, I was looking forward to my first visit.  I prefer restaurants that accept reservations, because I absolutely hate to wait, but luckily, the restaurant was practically empty. on a Sunday at 5:00.  My friend and I were immediately seated.  Our waitress seemed a bit \"green\" which, later proved to be true.  We ordered drinks, which arrived a short time later, my friend received the incorrect size drink, which was quickly remedied.  We proceeded to place our order.  My friend ordered the Bavarian Pretzel ($10), I thought was WAY over-priced for a soft pretzel with 2 small sides of dipping sauce.   $5 - $7 seemed more appropriate.  She also ordered the lamb burger.  I ordered the kale side salad and cuban sandwich, substituting fries for chips.  The pretzel arrived, and I assumed that my side salad would arrive shortly thereafter.....it did not.  My salad arrived approx 25 minutes later, along with my entree, so of course as I ate my salad, my entree was growing cold.  The salad was decent, if not also a bit overpriced for a side salad ($10).  Kale greens, chickpeas, and quinoa, maple viniagrette, topped with spiced pecans. The salad was pretty good except for the spiced pecans.  They should have been listed on the menu as \"spicy\" pecans.  There was too much cayenne, I couldn't eat them, so ended up pushing them to the side.  The Cuban sandwich was definitely tasty, nice bread, generous filling, perfectly toasted.  My fries grew cold, because I was working to finish my \"late\" salad.  My girlfriend enjoyed her lamb burger.  As we finished our meals, we noticed that the table next to us had cheesecake for dessert, which is my favorite.  The waitress returns to clear the table, (my girlfriend wasn't finished with her plate, when the waitress picked it up, to take it away) and asks if we would like dessert.  I mention that I would like to see the options.  She returns with a menu.  The menu doesn't list cheesecake.  I ask her about the cheesecake at the next table and she responds...oh yeah, that's today's special, there was also an ice cream special, as well.  We politely declined since we had to pry the info from her.  We asked for boxes for the leftovers, including condiment containers for the pretzel sauces.  We received boxes, but not condiment containers, and literally had to remind the waitress 2 additional times to bring those containers.  The experience was a little bit painful, the waitress was nice enough, but just wasn't polished enough.  I'll return, but this won't be one of my go-to places."}
{"text":"Delivered as reviewed by the yelp community. 
Came here w a business associate for dinner.  It's a Tuesday night so it was a little quiet. We were seated immediately by a very nice hostess. The service wAs great, very personable wAitress. On Tuesdays they have tacos for 2&3 dollars. I had a chicken, Tuna & pork taco & they were all excellent. 

The place is very comfortable, feels a little rustic but not like being in a cowboy bar. 

The only complaint was they don't allow samples of their wines. I had never heard this at any restaurant before. The server recommended a blend & it was good but I would've been a little twisted had it not been something I cared for. When u spend 9 bucks for a glass of wine you'd like to taste it beforehand to know that you'd like it. 

This was a little disappointing. Otherwise a very good dining experience.  Check it out of you haven't been."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant have some good burgers and starters. Love the interior design of this place."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays feature $2 and $3 tacos, and are quite nom. Examples: Yucatan BBQ pork, Carne Asada, Ahi Tuna, Spicy Shrimp, Vegan."}
{"text":"Food was very good, waiters are friendly, A bit pricey but other than that food taste fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"I'm in town for work and wanted to try something local and this place come up. It is a nice looking place lots of cars in the parking lot so must be good. I came in and asked for a table for myself, they asked if I would like the bar sure why not so I sat myself. I sat at the bar for about 7 minutes before the bartender came up, she just looked at me and I had to initiate the conversation. Kind of odd I said hi how are you and she said hi back. I ordered the side car a blackberry brandy drink very smooth. I sat for another 7 minutes and another bartendar said hi how are you. I told her I would like to order. So I finally did. I ordered the bacon tenderloins oh my this made up for the spotty service. They were incredible. That was worth the wait. Food awesome, service so so."}
{"text":"The Parmesan truffle pomme frites are amazing. I've been here twice and both times were great!  I've had the duck confit Mac n cheese which was beyond good and the spicy shrimp tacos- also great!  The cocktails are good too! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The Oak Barrel is a great compliment to the other bar restaurants near the movie theater on Canal Road. I am particularly pleased that this establishment is owned and operated by locals. The atmosphere and menu are a clean mix of casual and up scale. The extensive beer service (30 drafts and dozens of bottles) was the draw that led me here. I admit I thought this space was still Hoggie's. The food was a great surprise. The menu is a great mix of snacks, small plates, large plates and daily bar and menu specials. I have tried Joe Baby's Spiced Nuts, the Duck Fat Popcorn with lime/chili salt, the lobster roll, three different tacos on Taco Tuesday (including the TT Special taco) and the Dragon's Milk Brownie Sundae and Flourless Chocolate Torte. Everything was excellent! The snacks are just right if you just want to munch on something while you enjoy a beer or drink. The Duck Fat Popcorn rocks but make sure you have enough napkins! This is also the first place I have ever had Southern Tier's Warlock Imperial Pumpkin Stout on tap. My bartenders: Amanda, Caspian and Samantha were all personable and knew the menu and bar selection well and offered recommendations as well as pleasant conversation. I also got a glimpse of the owner/exec chef but did not have the chance to talk to him. Overall a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Ate here twice last week. Once for taco tuesday, which was amazing. I loved the spicy shrimp and the tuna tavos. The arugula salad is spectacular. Moscow mule was delicious but pricey. Second night was wine Wednesday where bottles are half ofd. Can't beat that. Also Sunday kids eat free for every adult meal. A great choice for delicious food, but family friendly"}
{"text":"Came in for a business dinner and was surprised.  I thought it might be an upscale steakhouse from the name but its not.  Service was great.  I thought the menu was somewhat narrow but the variety was decent.  I had the Dr. Pepper braised pork shank with roasted garlic whipped potatoes and chile soy jam.  The pork fell right off the bone and the sauce blended nicely - definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I recently returned because I enjoyed my meal last time. I wanted to sit at the bar so I was looking for a place. The host who ended up being my server startled me and shouted \"are you waiting for someone?\" I was annoyed and said no. I then asked for a table and was seated. 

He came over and I ordered the sidecar to drink. The server was unnecessarily brusque with me the whole meal. I wasn't really pleased about that considering my service the time before was not so great either. 

The sidecar was horrible. It tasted like cough syrup. Ugh. I ordered the baby kale salad and the onion rings for dinner. The onion rings were amazing!!! So good. But the baby kale salad was a soupy mess. The dressing was tasty but literally the salad was swimming in it. The arrangement of the elements of the salad was also weird, quinoa on one side, nuts in the middle, chickpeas on the other side. It was hard to eat and the deluge of dressing was just too much. I would probably still come back but it seems like this place is a bit hit and miss"}
{"text":"Was very unimpressed this time here. About three months ago I ordered the pork shank and it was huge and delicous. So this time I invited a work colleague. And boy was I embarrassed. I ordered the pork shank and it came out a third of the size as last time. Still good but I cleaned my plate which couldn't of happened last time. And my co worker ordered the St. Louis ribs and they were just about dust formed on a bone. Very unimpressed and this time I will not come back."}
{"text":"I try something different when I go. There are plenty of vegetarian and gluten free options. The food is always good but I feel it's a bit expensive."}
{"text":"I was really excited about trying this place because the menu looked amazing. It's beautiful inside, very cozy and romantic. We went on a Wednesday and we're told all wine bottles are 1/2 off, so we opted for the Riesling, a very good choice. For an app we got the Brie, again delicious! For whatever reason we were both craving burgers, so we got the sunny side burger with a side of garlic whipped potatoes and the oak burger. My biggest disappointment was when my burger (ordered medium rare) came out well done. I waited a few minutes for the waitress to come check on us and she obviously got a little busy which was no fault of her own, so I just went ahead and ate it. It was ok, but would have probably been amazing had it been cooked correctly. It's such a nice restaurant, and I was so let down that the cook wasn't as good."}
{"text":"I'm in Cleveland for the week, and had the chance to meet up with some friends who moved here recently.  My husband had been to Oak Barrel on a previous business trip and enjoyed it, so it seemed like a good place to meet up.

The menu is great, with lots of options, and they have a fantastic patio.  The beer menu has a lot of variety, and I was able to try a great new-to-me sour beer.  The food menu ranges from snacks to sandwiches to entrees.  Between the four of us we tried:
--baked brie: two friends split this as an appetizer since they got to the restaurant early and seemed to really like it.
--tacos: it was taco night so one friend took advantage.  The shrimp tacos looked great, but as you might expect, she said the taco-of-the-day \"hamburger taco\" was a bit odd.
--Oak Barrel Burger: I had their standard house burger, and really enjoyed it.  Ordering medium well got just the right amount of pink in the middle, and the pickled onions were a nice touch.
--braised pork shank: my husband had this, and finished it-- he said it was very good.  He even liked the mashed potatoes, and he's not ordinarily a potato person.
--pulled pork: I was very jealous of this dish-- a pile of yummy-smelling pulled pork over a piece of cornbread, topped with crunchy onions with cole slaw on the side.  Can't go wrong there.

Service was okay-- she was very friendly, but splitting the check proved to be inordinately difficult.  She was training someone, and maybe they were short staffed, but this was the only real problem we had.

I don't know Cleveland well, but Oak Barrel definitely would be worthy of a repeat visit."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant. Amazing food and service. Never had anything bad. This place has taught me to try new foods, surprisingly, ones that I liked! I highly recommend the whole menu.  I'm privileged to work and live down the street from Oak Barrel, definitely a highlight in my life. I'm here at least once a week.. If not more. It's always more.. Mac n cheese, tuna tacos, salmon, calamari, shrimp Cobb salad, dr pepper pork, ribs, chicken - just a few of their items I love. Come eat!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!! We had the gin fizz, the chicken livers  over polenta and the croque monsieur pizza. Everything was just yummy!! Sat at the bar and the service was impeccable!!"}
{"text":"I only got the BBQ pulled pork tacos, but they were definitely 5/5. Atmosphere and service was also very nice."}
{"text":"I used to live in the area but came back for work recently and decided to find some chow that wasn't bar food. I remember this being a Hoggy's BBQ joint a few years ago, so when you walk in, the place looks huge. Fortunately they've classed it up quite a bit and it feels like a nice modern restaurant.

For the food, I ordered the Duck confit mac and cheese and my coworker ordered the Cuban sandwich. The Duck confit M&C was phenomenal. I really like how this restaurant takes homestyle cooking to the next level and adds some flare to it. The M&C comes with a well put-together side salad with fresh mixed greens. My coworker's testament to the Cuban was that it was an above average Cuban with a really good artisan mustard on it. The chips on the side were fairly average (lack of flare), but then again, they're chips.

I also can't resist Creme Brulee when I find it on a menu (I'm kind of a CB snob). While Oak Barrel's flavor wasn't anything imaginative, they made it well, the consistency was perfect, and compared to other restaurants, they give you a boatload of it. 

Overall, this place really improves the dining quality in the area and is pretty modestly priced for how good the food is."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites. I have yet to find a dish I don't like. Chicken and Waffles, Tacos, Ribs, Salmon. Great service, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"So ambiance is very nice and this is very clean restaurant if your not sitting outside. So many birds nest under the awning area bird poop everywhere tables and chairs.  I ordered the walleye sandwich. Walleye greasy and bland the topping were ok. But walleye not so much. My daughter got burger.  She did like the burger I had a bite was tasty.  The fries again tasted greasy like they sat over fryer.  The drinks were good the water was warm.  I will come back try other plates update this later as of now. Just bland.  The service was good. So this is not knock on service or place.  Just current meals we had."}
{"text":"I believe in you, Oak Barrel, I really do. I see your potential, it's right there in front of you. So why the hell won't you reach out and grab it already?

After what would mark our third visit to the establishment in nearly as many months, I still can't bring myself to tack on the fourth star. I..I really want to, I swear, but I simply can't. This latest visit was destined to be three stars and I suppose there's really nothing wrong with that.

First, I don't like how they've chosen to serve/price their beers. It's like three card Monty on the street corner. It's confusing and misleading. What's up with using 11oz snifters (filled with 9-10oz of beer) for average ABV brews? I know, it's so you can make more money. It's a simple matter of economics, I get it. BTW, check their website menu, it used to read 12oz. The menu at the restaurant now reads 11oz and the prices are the same. The whole thing seems shady to me. Why reinvent the wheel? If it's over say, 7% serve it in a snifter. If it's under serve me a full pint. Don't overcharge me and then try to hide it with a smoke and mirrors show. And you probably shouldn't be offering an 11.5% imperial stout in a full pint - not very responsible of you, is it? Moving on.

The service was fine. Our young, eager-to-please waitress was constantly stopping back to ask if things were \"still OK here\". She was always hovering just out of sight. For me, it was overkill, but I know she's still learning. I guess I'd rather have too attentive than completely absent. Our water glasses were never empty and dishes were promptly cleared. I remember liking the food quite a bit, but this visit wouldn't be a repeat.

We started with the deviled eggs. They weren't as good as I remembered. They're underseasoned and I didn't taste the smoked paprika (probably because it wasn't there). The wife digs 'em. If not for her I'd have passed on these.

It was taco Tuesday. A selection of tacos, some priced $2 some $3, with fancy names like \"carne asada steak\" and \"Amish chicken\". I hadn't tried their tacos yet so I was on board. The arrived at the table and the first thing I noticed was how big the flour tortillas seemed in comparison to the fillings. I had initially thought they'd forgotten to put anything in them but then I realized I just hadn't looked closely enough. Sure, I get it, they're only a few bucks, but c'mon people. A guy needs to eat and a few tiny slivers of chicken and sprigs of cilantro aint gonna do it. Speaking of cilantro, there was a ton of it so it was pretty much all I could taste. Disappointing.

The spousal unit opted for the roasted turkey sandwich. Again, this was just OK. The pita was a bit too crunchy and the bacon was soggy. The turkey, thinly sliced, appeared more lunch meat than brasserie but the herb mayo that came with it and the use of bibb lettuce and sprouts added a nice touch. I also liked the falafal \"disc\" that was served in the sandwich. Overall, not a bad offering, but $11?

I'm not really sure about Oak Barrel. I want to like them more than I do and it just seems that every time I go there I like them a little less. Yeah, they've got a decent beer list, but who doesn't? They've got a menu that sounds more interesting that it is. I have yet to find a crave-worthy menu item. Natalie had it right. I'm torn."}
{"text":"The Oak Barrel was pretty decent. On a Saturday night, we waited about 15 minutes before being seated even though they were not extremely busy. The food wasn't spectacularly special and it was reasonably priced. If you are hungry going in, I would suggest a sandwich or burger. Their burgers are a big portion, probably enough for two."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side, but fun atmosphere and a hipster type of menu.  I was here with a group and everyone liked their meals.   The waitress was friendly and knowledgable.  While it was a little pricey you feel like you got a good quality meal for the price.  They seem to support local farmers etc... to flush out their menu which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"The service was really bad--the hostess was really standoffish, sat us at a crappy table even though the place was pretty empty, and then the server didn't show up to take a drink order for 20 minutes. The drinks took another 20 minutes to arrive. The food itself was pretty good although some of the flavor pairings were weird (garlic toasted baguette with a sweet brie in puff pastry was not great). When you're only going there because you're seeing a movie before/after, it will do and is much better than Quaker Steak and Lube, which seems to be the only other option in the area. Meh."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and read the reviews so I had to come here. It was a great experience here both the food and the service. Ordered the chicken and waffles and they were really good. I had never had it before and this was a great place to experience them for the first time. To top off our wonderful time, the manager gave us a $20 gift card because he thought our service was slow due to a large party our waitress had. We did not even complain or notice that it was taking a long time. Everyone must try this place. Worth the drive where ever you are."}
{"text":"5 adults, 5 different meals, 5 people raving about their food.  Service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Ok, had great hope for this place, but the steamed cod smelled and tasted like dirty gym socks. Atmosphere good, service friendly, and the replacement salad was pretty good, pretty good chance we will not be returning to this spot."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection. I had the 1/2 rack ribs and husband had the pulled pork. Not the best we've ever had, but decent enough. Neat atmosphere. Server was a lil \"odd\" but it was about an hour before closing time."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a visit through town and absolutely enjoyed ourselves. The food is outstanding. We ordered the onion rings, as an appetizer, to start. They were delicious. The Dragon's Milk brownie sunday was amazing."}
{"text":"Probably about the best burger. It was huge so I cut it in half and the deliciousness wafted up. This is do over for sure. Couldn't eat it all but I  wanted to!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations, being so close to the movie theater I expected more of a chain atmosphere, but I was pleasantly surprised. Decor was relaxing, even for a Saturday night, not too loud, call ahead seating was a nice touch. The draft list was impressive, 12-14 taps I'd say and many more specific n bottle , many bourbon choices though I do not partake, and a nice wine and cocktail list too. Food was great , the duck Mac and cheese was very good comes with a house salad with a house vinaigrette. All in all I'd like to go back ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"Holy burgers, Batman. 

We stopped by The Oak Barrel before our 9PM movie not just because the only other option was Quaker Steak & Lube, but because I've been meaning to check it out for a while now. And the burger-induced comma that followed made me miss about half of Mad Max. But it's okay, it was the third time I'd seen it anyways. 

We started with some tequila on the rocks. I appreciated the big cubes of ice, however, I didn't love the amount of ice in drink. There was so much piled up in there I had to be real classy and scoop some out with my hand. I know. I'm not proud. 

We were going to get the pretzels and popcorn, but we thought, \"We'll get that stuff at the movies.\" and got two bacon cheese burgers instead. Oh my god, we're dumb. When the burgers came out I realized there was no eating after this monster for at least 5-7 hours. The brioche bun was so buttery you could taste it in every juicy bite. Speaking of juicy, the patty itself was delightfully seasoned, cooked to a perfect medium rare and the thickness was ideal for comfortable bites. You could tell it was quality beef. The flavor sang in perfect harmony with the white cheddar, crisp smokey bacon and loads of what tasted like homemade pickles. I also enjoyed the crispy on the outside, soft on inside fries--also obviously house-made 

Just about the only part of this meal that wasn't in perfect harmony was the bill. While the burger was phenomenal, I'm a strong believer that no burger should cost over $10. At $15 a pop ($30 on burgers), it kind of took the wind out of my burger sails. Quality ingredients shouldn't mean huge price tags for comfort foods. 

So yea, like I said, I pretty much burger-napped through half of the movie afterwards. And no, we didn't each any more all night. That delicious burger was more than enough."}
{"text":"I do really like the atmosphere of this restaurant as far as gastro-pubs go. It's roomy and cozy at the same time.  The staff are friendly enough and the service was fine.  My main issue is the food. It wasn't bad - I actually liked my veggie sliders. It wasn't unique though. And it wasn't spectacular.  The city of Cleveland has many great restaurant options so I rarely go out to the suburbs.  I appreciate having a decent restaurant by the Cinemark, but I think there is some room for improvement with actual quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, and food! The unsweetened flavored tea (raspberry) was delicious as were the pomme frittes (lots of cheese!) and Amish chicken tacos. My husband had the Dr. Pepper braised beef and the sauce and mashed potatoes were very good. The menu has something for everyone, and I can't wait to go back to try more!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town. Great Bourbon list. The sunny side burger is fantastic. Cool atmosphere inside and awesome patio seating. The baby back ribs are very good as well."}
{"text":"There's no way I can put into words how amazing this place is. When I'm in Cleveland for work I usually eat here multiple times throughout the week. A great mix of southern comfort dishes - including my favorite grass fed filet, chicken livers with polenta,  oysters, pork shank, I could go on and on. Everything is amazing on the menu, great list of beers, and an extensive bourbon selection. Taco Tuesdays are also a perfect reason to visit this place. You can't go wrong. I promise!!!"}
{"text":"A great selection of creative foods. I had the duck confit macaroni and cheese and it was great, my wife's Dr. Pepper braised pork shank was even better."}
{"text":"Had the burger, and it was not very memorable. The service was not good either. Maybe it was an off night considering this place gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"The Oak Barrel is one of those places I have been several times but have never given a review. My husband and I are big and of Chef Demetrios Atheneos (Forage Public House, Bold Food and Drink) so The Oak Barrel has become one of favorite places to meet friends for lunch or enjoy a cocktail before going to a movie at the neighboring Cinemark. Like all of Chef Atheneos' restaurants the food is classy, farm-to-table and really freaking good! I love the rustic chic vibe and the killer patio space."}
{"text":"Beer is good!!!
We only had apps so  that is what I will  comment on so....
Popcorn cooked in duck fat topped with garlic butter....I've done garlic butter on my popcorn and was good but didn't know it was duck fat so I tasted nothing new...
FF with shaved Parmesan cheese and bacon...YUM!!!
Deviled eggs....I am a deviled egg expert and my friends don't let me make anything other then them when a side dish is required....So...Meh...
I got NO flavour and I wanted to taste something...Sadly I didn't...
Onion rings YUM!!! Light and crunchy! The dipping sauce again had no flavour and I was wondering how do you make a sauce that has absolutely NO taste? Then I started to think maybe it was just a garnish...
Rosemary Mayonnaise for the ff? That was very nice!!! Wonder if they make their own mayo/salad dressing....
I was thinking maybe the beer turned off my taste buds but when I got home I spooned some teriyaki chicken from the night before and I tasted that...
Not my dime so...But  someone else go there and make sure to review....
Moreso a 2 than a 3 but the atmosphere and service was perfect!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed. The beer was tasty,  I liked the ambiance however I found it a bit pricey. $24 for a pork chop, it was a single THIN chop.
I made management aware and they were apologetic, which I appreciate. They assured me it should have been thick. The gift card was nice, thank you. My colleagues enjoyed their meals; chicken and waffles and fish, most likely it would have made it a 4 star experience if I stuck with my gut and also got chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Went to the Oak Barrel Saturday night and OMG I can't stop thinking about the food! We had sushi quality, Ahi Tuna Tartare to die for, fried Crispy Calamari, fried chicken liver with creamy polenta and the best crab cakes I've ever had in my life. Our entrées were delicious, as well. Dr. Pepper Braised Pork Shank that you have to taste to believe. Chicken and waffles with blackberry syrup, that were so moist and succulent that I'll be dreaming about it for a long time. The filet mignon wrapped
 In bacon with blue cheese mashed potatoes was so tender and juicy! My husband said the meat was so tender that he didn't know how the cow stood up! Lol! 
The service was attentive despite the fact that the main dining room was totally packed and there was a large party upstairs. For dessert we had Tiramisu, Creme Brûlée homemade ice cream and flour less Chocolate Cake with Bacon Crumbles. And yes, it was as decadent as it sounds. Do not hesitate to go to the Oak Barrel. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times the food was good, the atmosphere/experience has varied though. Let me explain...

First time I came here it was on a Friday right after work, just me at the bar around 5:30pm. Everything was fine, I was just chilling and enjoying my happy hour drink (Cosmo $5, Blod Sangria $10) and some light bites (deviled egg $3 and bacon wrapped dates $10). Staff was personable and helpful with menu selections. BUT THEN 6pm rolled around and the place instantly filled up with well-off white guys over 45. There were some older ladies as well, but I was definitely the youngest person in there. 

It got incredibly loud, guys surrounded my bar stool like an old man wall between me and freedom. My plans to enjoy solo happy hour time were dashed by men talking about their kids names, Trump, and how they don't age. Dude, I have eyes, you've definitely aged. This place got so busy inside that the four people behind the bar could not keep up, men were loudly complaining about how they ordered a beer 10 minutes ago. I can't hate on them for complaining, I myself was a bit disgruntled that I was waiting so long for my to-go order (duck confit mac & cheese $18 - good but too fatty for me) and had to ask about it several times. It was ready, just no one had time to grab it and cash me out. So I sat and awkwardly waited, desperately texting my friends for some sort of reprieve from this loud-all up in my space-old man madness I was experiencing. 

I was finally able to escape! I broke through the wall of gray hair (they have money, they can afford hair plugs) and quickly went to my car where I immediately took a selfie to capture the look of repulsion on my face and shared it everyone. When life is crazy, make fun of it. 

Second visit I came on a Tuesday after work with a friend. Again around 5:30pm in the bar area. This time, while the place did become steady with patrons, it was still a good atmosphere where staff was able to pay attention to you and you could relax and chat with a friend without yelling or feeling like you were smashed in. There seemed to also be more of a mix of people, while not a lot of twenty somethings, it wasn't all geriatrics either. I enjoyed $2/$3 tacos with lettuce wraps for shells then my friend and I split a crème brûlée $9. 

So to sum it up, I enjoyed the food and you can get good deals on happy hour items or daily specials. Would recommend if you came with a friend during the week, but way too crazy otherwise unless maybe you sat in the dining room, in a corner, with a rope blocking off your table and brought your own waitstaff."}
{"text":"I have dined here several times and have never been disappointed. I've specifically come for the burger on a few occasions. I usually opt for the Sunny Side, made of local beef and local egg - you can absolutely taste the difference in quality. Substitute truffle fries or onion rings for regular fries - well worth it. Some other notable items I've had - the pulled pork with jalapeño cornbread (omg!), the Dr Pepper braised pork shank, and the arugula salad. All were winners. Service has always been great. On this particular visit, the manager Mary went out of her way to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. Our server, Brittany, though new, was super nice and kept on top of things on a busy \"Wine Down Wednesday\" evening (half off select bottles of wine!). The patio is lovely, and tonight they had live music inside. Will return soon!"}
{"text":"Overall the place was not bad. Fish sandwich was good and the burger was good. I would like the place even more if they had parking in front of the place. The only parking in front is the 8 or so handicapped spots and the 4 take out spots."}
{"text":"Living in Texas has provided the opportunity to eat a lot of good BBQ, and The Oak Barrel ranks among the best.  Excellent ribs. The Cooks really know what their doing.  To have ribs that moist, it takes low heat for a long time, and the Oak Barrel nailed it.  Our Server, Bob, brought out some pulled pork to sample too.  Again, very tender and well cooked.  Will be back again the next time we're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My huband and I are in town from MI for the night. We ate here because of the good yelp reviews and the hotel recommendation. So happy we did! Delicious!!! The service was great also. I had the pork shank and my husband (who is a chef) had the chicken and waffles. We both loved our food. It's very nice and spacious inside also. I will come back again if I should find myself in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Located beside (walkable) from the Cinemark at Valley View which is so nice. I love to pair a movie and a delightful meal.  The Oak Barrel is a gastropub that has a cozy interior decor and in the winter the main dining room has a fireplace.  Outdoors there is a fire pit if you want to wait outside.  

I was delighted to learn this place has the owner/chef the started out with Deagan's in Lakewood which when he was there it was fabulous.  The menu here has many of my old favorites when he was in Lakewood and I've soooo missed.  The chicken breast with waffles -- delish!  The deviled eggs for appetizers and the brie cheese -- great!  Great mac and cheese as entree or a side!  The entree (and side) salads are fresh and interesting. The grilled salmon with whipped potatoes are excellent (my go-to choice) and I loved the side arugula salad with beets, goat cheese and candied walnuts. So delicious. Writing this makes makes me wanna make a trip south for dinner.

Excellent draft beer selection that changes and interesting mixed drinks and wines.  Service is always spotty -- seems to be a lot of turnover and not well-trained staff but the food and environment is so great that I'm willing mostly to overlook it. Would love to see that improve and then I'd go with 5-stars."}
{"text":"My worst restaurant experience in my 42 years was 5/28/17 here.  I'm still waiting for my initial drink order 20 hours later.  My husband's food was ice cold and the waitress didn't even offer to bring it back to the kitchen and heat it up.  She just shrugged.  We were unsuccessful begging for water (and the manager just said they were understaffed at the bar - makes no sense for water).  The amount of staff apathy at the horrid service was frankly mind boggling.  At the end of the night, the best they could come up with was a 15 percent discount.

My husband and friend wrote letters to management and received back pre-drafted form letters.

I can count on my two hands the number of times I have complained about service in my life, since I've been in their shoes - but this one is memorable.

Will never ever be a patron again."}
{"text":"Nice place. Interesting menu with a great beer selection. We enjoy coming here for dinner before or after a movie. It is a little pricy but very good food. Their bathrooms need some work, but their staff is usually pretty helpful and willing to please. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food service was exceptionally quick. However, the chef left my St. Louis ribs on the fire a little too long; they were charred. Our waiter was often occupied by the large party in our seating area leaving us to flag down other waiters from time to time."}
{"text":"Everything was exceptional except for the main entree. $27 for a few ounces of beef tenderloin \"wrapped\" in bacon. Sounded a lot better than what it was. We ordered all our food togo. Apps were good. Loved the brie. Bartender was super knowledgeable and the draft beer & wine selection were very nice. But cmon $27 for that???? The mashed potato to steak ratio was 5/1 in case the pic didn't capture that."}
{"text":"Good eats, good drinks and good beer selection. The bar is well stocked and bartenders are fun and attentive. Some times service in the main restaurant can be a little dicey and slow, but never rude and they will fix a problem immediately. The menu is limited but what they do prepare has always been flavorful and well cooked."}
{"text":"I have thought long and hard about this... but I am gonna go with 5 stars. My first visit back in March was very good so I gave it 4 stars. The food and beer were great and the ambiance enjoyable. I went back again yesterday and the beer was even better (they had a very hard to find local brew on tap...Columbus Brewing Co.'s Bodhi) and the Cuban sandwich was perfect. The atmosphere was decent, not real bustling but it was early. (It is a little uppity but I was completely comfortable wearing shorts and t-shirt.) What put this experience over the top was the cornhole boards out front along with the outdoor bar they had set up. That is enough to win me over everyday of the week:) Great job Oak Barrel!!"}
{"text":"Interior design was amazing! Very large spot with great menu options. The drink menu was everything. I loved how the sweeter cocktails had natural sweetners versus syrups. So the cocktails were perfection."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience.  Sometimes the quality of the service makes all the difference.  Our server was one of the best ever and I left the largest percentage tip I ever have in my life.  She recommended things from the menu coming in the future with fine detail.  Being out if town, she went out of her way to recommend common requests only regulars would know.   Food was really good and served timely and for us the service was excellent.  My recommendation  is the baby kale salad, pear cider and burger, and add an egg to the burger.  Found the homemade pickles to have a unique taste.  Waitresses said the have thier own brine."}
{"text":"Their Pork Shank, Tacos, and Ahi Tuna Appetizer are ALL Amazing.  The prices arent TOO bad for the quality of food you get... its a 'Local when possible / wholesome food' kind of venue, that focuses on 'just shy of Fine Dining.'  I like that its a BBQ joint with a creative, unique menu.  Amazing beer selections and cool ambiance indoors and out.  Usually great service."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautifully designed and decorated and they have a ton of different beers on draft. Food is great, my only issue going here has been some inconsistency with the severs. Some of them have excellent but there have been a couple of people are not so great. Overall though, I would definitely recommend going here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant south of Cleveland! This place has it all-- the ambiance alone could bring me back(seriously good music selections, awesome interior design, and a delightful smoky smell that feel like you're diving headfirst into an oak barrel), the staff is incredibly friendly and seems to enjoy where they're working, and the food is absolutely delicious and worth every penny. I love going here for lunch-- the food always arrives quickly (even if the place is full of people). They also have an awesome outside patio and lounge area in the summer time to sit and enjoy a fireplace! We were just here two days ago for lunch but we're going back tonight for dinner! Thanks for being such a wonderful business! Trust me-- eat here and you'll be running back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Enjoyed sharing the bavarian pretzel, a tasty po boy (which isn't really a po boy, but it's an awesome sandwich nonetheless), duck fat popcorn (i love, some found too salty), truffle frites, onion rings, devils on horseback, creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake. even my son's grilled cheese was good and the fruit they gave him was actually fresh and delicious. on our first trip the service was flawless; the second, it was awful. as in the server gave us rude looks when we kindly reminded her that we had asked for a water 10 minutes ago... so 4 instead of 5."}
{"text":"Can I just say...that I just love this place!

This has become a hit spot for my wife and I to dine in. Not only that, we have become so sold on this place, whenever I have meetings with friends...I want to eat here. Anytime I have family from out of town, I eat here. I love this place so much. 

Service is great every time. I feel all the servers are incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, the beer, and pretty much anything you can think of (Restaurant Related).

Food is simply amazing. This isn't a place just to eat a burger and that's it. This is a place to enjoy some really good food! (My favorite are the Onion Rings #Amazing). 

The decor is simple, folky, chill, and nice. Such a good place to come and feel welcoming and cozy while eating great food. 

I recently had the chance to do my 30th Birthday Dinner @ Oak Barrel and it turned out great. We had the entire upstairs and they were very accommodating. 

If my wife and I ever move away, we will sadly miss this place. If you have not tried this place out yet, DO IT :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Who'd expect this in the suburbs!?"}
{"text":"The outside architecture would lead one to believe that this place is great but my experience was not the case.

We were seated out on the patio and spent the majority of our dinner swatting away flies. The paper menus were water-marked and crumpled up (they had seen better days). Our server had the personality of a wet napkin. There were two different kinds of music blaring, Nicklebacks greatest hits on the patio and Dave Matthews latest live album from the ... other side of the patio.

The appetizers were delicious, onion rings hand breaded and fried with a great sauce. Our drinks were warm and quickly watered down after the ice melted. My friends burger came out over-cooked and dry. My $13 chicken sandwich came out on dry toast that looked like it came from Giant Eagle, over-grilled and burnt chicken breast with a slice of deli meat that also looked like it came from the deli at Giant Eagle, with a side of some ruffled potato chips. 

On our way out, my friend and I stopped to have a chat and a smoke on the patio where there are a cluster of oak barrels with metal stools. We stepped around some corn hole boards that no one was using. It was there that we figured out where the flies were coming from. Some of the barrels had umbrellas coming out of a hole in the middle, but some were just barrels with the umbrellas removed. We sat at a barrel with just the hole and flies were literally pouring out of it. My friend and I commented and chuckled that this must be where all of the flies had been coming from.

For what we paid, it was not worth it. Warm drinks, below par food, mediocre service, in a nice looking building. In a city full of fabulous eateries, this place is not worth anyone's hard earned money and won't last long."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the Dr Pepper Braised pork is delicious! I've been here 3 times and got that 2/3! The chicken tacos were very good too! 

The atmosphere is very nice for a date night or even a night out with friends! 

That all being said, the first time we went we had a large group of 15 - ordered drinks then had to wait a hour to order dinner. The next time was for my moms bday - her ribs were extremely DRY, the waitress even said the chef tried the batch and 100% agreed. They brought my mom the Dr pepper braised pork (which she loved! Sauce on the side since she doesn't care for spicy stuff) and told her the ribs would be comp'ed. Once we got the bill the ribs were comped but her 2nd meal which she had to eat alone (we were all done by the time she got it) was charged full price- when I questioned the manager - she questioned me back as to the problem as they comped the ribs. I responded with normally when the chef agrees the first meal was bad - the real meal you can actually eat would be comped also. This ended up being done - but I wasn't happy how it was handled. The waitress was perfect during it all, it was how management handled it."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow, but they got 3 very large tables within a matter of minutes of each other.  Seemed to have a very good teamwork ethic.  I would go back in a heartbeat.  A very wide selection of craft beers.  Good food."}
{"text":"I went here on a date. We tried the free duck fat popcorn which was a neat spin on popcorn. We also had the calamari as an appetizer which was amazing! I'm a huge fan of calamari and I try it anytime a restaurant has it on the menu. I was blown away! The chef cooked it to perfection (it wasn't rubbery at all) and the sauce drizzled on top brought it in for a home run! The ahi tuna tacos and the mussels were also fantastic! I was surprised to see that the mussels weren't just on top of the fries, but were present all the way to the bottom of the bowl. You get a great and affordable meal at the oak barrel. The beer menu is great too. Plenty of new and unique beers/ales to try. The hibiscus beer (I forget the actual name) was awesome! Service was out of this world as well! One of the men bussing tables told us about the duck fat popcorn from the yelp app. We were also approached several times when we were first seated to make sure our drink orders had been taken. Everyone was super friendly and made us feel great!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed in the experience that my husband and I had and here is why .  My husband went to the movies and saw the building and name and thought it would be a great place to try.  The outside is. It impressive; but who really cares, it is what is inside that counts.  When you find the front door and go in it is a nice place.  The inside is warm and inviting.  However, with the name Oak Barrel you need to have people behind the bar that know what they are talking about.  My husband ordered 4 different bourbons before there was one in stock.  So first of all, have what you advertise.  Second - train your staff on what you have.  It should not take 15 minutes to get drinks because the bartender did not know what we were ordering or if it was available.  Oh, and this was in the middle of the day and we were 2 of 5 at the bar.  We did not get any food because we had just left the movies and were not hungry.  We will give this place another try.  So much potential, so little delivery.  Hopefully our second try will be better."}
{"text":"...Eerily familiar calamari, fried chicken livers, duck mac-n-cheese, spicy shrimp tacos, devils on the horseback, more beer choices than stars in the sky, it has everything Deagans on the Westside is missing at the moment- including its former chef. It was a very tasty de javu - wood, malbec, fireplace, immaculate service...I just don't understand why did he have to move all this wonderfulness so far away from me? I consider it all highly unfair. Plus I am afraid this baby is going to die soon. It thrived in Lakewood simply because it had wonderful location and appropriate clientele. I am not sure Valley View has an equivalent of crowds of weird Lakewood kids eager to wash down duck's meat with over-priced larger. Valley View is not ready yet for such an extravaganza. And echo-friendly rotten spoiled lakewooders would rather consume rubbery Calamari than drive that far. Lakewood does not  go to valley View. You have more choices of Lebron James returning to play for Cleveland than that happening. Place was empty on Friday night while at Deagans at the same time there was a Babylon's crowd...
So I suggest for this wonderful chef to come back home. And we will pretend you have never left. I promise."}
{"text":"This is going to be short but sweet. The first time I came here I got the mussels, recommended to me by one of my friends who frequents the place, and I wasn't disppointed. They were delicious!

More recently I came here for drinks at night with friends.It's a great place for large groups because not only is this place massive and you can enjoy your time comfortably, the menu has a wide variety that will cater to everyone's tastes.

One of my favorite drinks is Hemingway vs. The Krakken and not just because that name is fantastic. It's rum based but fruity and delicious. Their meads are also pretty good.

The service was fast and pleasant so no complaints there either!

I definitely need to come back - I've been craving mussels recently and if I get that, might as well pair that with a drink!"}
{"text":"Chef Demetrios Atheneos is back! The Launch Party was a huge success: fabulous cocktails, an extensive craft beer list and delicious food made for a great night. 

Some favorites of the night were the tacos, devils on horseback and the house smoked sausage. Their version of gourmet popcorn includes duck fat, white truffle oil and chili lime sea salt. For only $4 - it's a must try! 

The extensive remodel also includes the addition of a sleek gas fireplace on the patio. There is an upstairs loft that you can rent for private functions too."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the Oak Barrel after seeing a movie and OMG, I can't wait to come back. The server, Amber, was awesome and thoroughly went over the menu since it was our first time there. The onion rings appetizer was delicious but definitely more than enough for 2 people. I ordered the Lamb Kefta Burger with Mac n cheese and wow! The meat and the goat cheese taziki melt in your mouth! The mac n cheese is good but very very rich! My husband ordered the open face pulled pork and the smokey flavor was bomb! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went for Father's Day in June 2017. Food was great. Our server was very pleasant and helpful. Love the decor. I would definitely go again.
We met the owner upon leaving and he was very friendly and personable."}
{"text":"My wife and I thought that this was a great find. The menu was loaded with local ingredients, and certainly not the same boring thing that you would find at other places. There were  alot of interesting sounding dishes that I would definitely like to go back and try. Having said that, we played it safe on the first time in and got a grilled cheese sandwich, macaroni and cheese,  and the walleye PO-boy. The homemade fries were crunchy fresh and hot just like we like them, and our server Stephanie did a really great job. The one downside, was that they ran out of crème brûlée.  So we will have to try that on a future visit."}
{"text":"This place is so close to getting 4 stars from me. I have been here for dinner twice, once with family and once with friends. Both times there was one or two meals out of the 6 that just fell flat. 

With a group of my friends my girlfriend got the pork belly croque-monsieur pizza. There was hardly any pork, any cheese, and no béchamel sauce to speak of. womp-womp. 

With my family my sister ordered a turkey flat bread. Now, I know that no one should expect food nirvana from a turkey flat bread, but this thing had like, one slice of turkey on it. womp-womp.

I have been lucky and loved the food I got (ribs both times lol). Also got a meat board and was very impressed with it.

They have some creative and good cocktails as well as a good beer list. If I can go to this place with a group of 5 or 6 people and have every dish come out up to par. Then the Oak Barrel will get 4 stars."}
{"text":"well the spouse and I went on Saturday with another couple.. tried the duck fat popcorn and calamari for snacks.  We all love the calamari.. the duck fat popcorn was a 50/50 split.. I must say watch out on that stuff.. you start to eat and next thing you know you think you might behaving a heart attack ..lol  its heavy and very deceiving.. so much so that I could barely eat half of my main course and finish my second beer...  thats a sin!!!!!  Everyone liked their main course.  pulled pork.. root beer shank and beef tenderloin.. can't remember what the other one was but no complaints...  Only downsiide was drink service was a bit slow but other than that it was very tasty and no complaints...."}
{"text":"The Oak Barrel is a great dining experience for those looking for something a little different from your typical American fare with a relaxing atmosphere and comfortable price. We ordered the pom frit (fries with grated parmesan) appetizer, the vegan falafel sliders with a side of leek and spinach whipped potatoes, and the small amish chicken and waffles. The generous portions left us without want and the flavors were a little unexpected but very delicious! Our server, Natalie was helpful in making our selections and took care of us very well! The menu is so large and the server was so great, I really want to come back again."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! I shared the chicken and Waffles with my little one and we couldn't even finish it. Also, great craft beer selection."}
{"text":"Late Saturday afternoon, table for 2 ~ service slow, restaurant virtually empty.  Food over-priced and over-rated.  I had walleye which was greasy and fishy tasting; my dining partner enjoyed the ribs and HUGE bowl of mashed spuds!  I wouldn't rush back for a second look at The Oak Barrel."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here a handful of times, the food has always been delicious. Although the last time (about a month ago), the food wasn't as exceptional as it usually is. But I'll give them a pass and hope it was just an off day, because every other time has been great. My husband loves the chicken and waffles. I love their Mac and cheese and their lobster roll. And the calamari is excellent. The duck fat popcorn is also very good, something different to try. They have a good selection of beers, the last time they had an over abundance of ipa's on draft it would have been nice to see a little more variety."}
{"text":"I have always had such a great experience here. The food was always delicious and decently priced, ambiance is rustic and cozy. But the past time we ate here I got so incredibly sick after my meal (steak).. for days from their food, I wont provide details but all the symptoms pointed to straight to food poisoning. I am very disappointed because this was one of our favorite restaurants in town but now I am iffy to ever eat here again."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend while in Cleveland & she suggested for us to try this place out.

I love the way this restaurant was laid out. The owner had a vision of making this a gastropub with a french twist and that's exactly what it felt like. 

They offer plenty of seating inside & out, but the best place to sit when it's nice outside on a Friday night is right in front next to the fire pit.

Janeen was our server & she was awesome. Always checking in on us & making sure we were all set.

Here's what we shared:

Baked Camembert Brie - Delicious! A most have.

Butcher's Plate - Was good & had a nice presentation, but didn't care for it too much.

Carne Asada Steak Tacos - Tender, moist, & delicious. Only thing that needs improvement is the steak needs to be cut into smaller pieces.

Oak Barrel Burger - Moist, not tough to eat, & delicious. The veggies were great & looked too pretty to eat. The chips needed salt though."}
{"text":"Most amazing Chocolate flower less Tort and creme brûlée. And we eat a lot of
It where we travel"}
{"text":"I heard hoggy closed down and got replaced by a new restaurant called oak barrel. Decided to try out the new restaurant with my dad. The atmosphere was very nice. Dim lights with a old wooden house surrounding made me feel very cozy. The waiter was very friendly and was well informed about each item on the menu. I ended up ordering the pulled pork bbq plate and my dad got the roasted chicken and sausage. I absolutely love the pulled pork. There was a very nice smooth and soft texture that came with a smoke flavor. The bbq sauce wasn't too strong and had a tangy taste to it. The pull pork was pile up about 6 to 7 inches high top with fried onion and Cole slaw. At the bottom of the pile of pulled pork was some type of apple flavor bread that sweeten overall flavor when eaten together. The pull pork was 5 stars imo. I wasn't a big fan of the roasted chicken and sausage that my dad ordered. Under the all the chicken and sausage was French fries but there was no ketchup bottle in sight. For a dish that cost 19$ I kinda expect something more from it. I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because I only went once so far and the roasted chicken and sausage was kinda a disappointment compared to the pulled pork plate."}
{"text":"I really, really liked this place. A friend and I were in the area for a movie and decided to eat here instead of Quaker State, probably because we were all sports-bar'd-out. It turned out to be a really good decision, because this place rules. Of course, each new restaurant nowadays has to go the \"We're not just a restaurant, we're a GASTROPUB\" route. Whatever, as long as it has good food and a decent beer selection, I'm down. And this place has both. It may be the actual largest beer selection that I can recall in the Cleveland area -- the booze menu alone is, like, a dozen pages. You can get small, medium and large beers if you're in a choose-y mood. And the food was freakin' fantastic. I got the Cuban sandwich, with ham, pulled pork and pickles so tasty I could have eaten just them on the sandwich. My compatriot got the pulled pork sandwich on cornbread, and that looked delicious as well. Later in the evening they have live music around their huge fire pit near the nice patio. Walking back from the movie, I heard the sweet, sweet strains of some local band playing an off-kilter version of \"Lithium,\" which kind of makes me wish I had hung out there all night drinking dozens of different tiny beers."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place!  Like the decor and the food.  The pomme frites come with herb mayo which is absolutely yummy!!  I even asked for more to use instead of tartar sauce on my fish & chips.!  I've gone back once already for lunch.  Service was good but not excellent."}
{"text":"My husband have been here at least a dozen times and they have never disappointed. The tacos are super delicious, my favorite are the falafel and they are even cheaper if you go on Tuesdays. My husband always gets the chicken and waffles and he says that no other place that he has had them compares. The truffle oil fries and soft pretzel are very good apps. The salads are good and so is the falafel burger."}
{"text":"After seeing a movie at the nearby theater, my boyfriend and I decided to go here for dinner as it is right next door. A friend of his said if he were ever in a situation where a \"last meal\" request needed to be made, it would be a dish from here.

Sadly, the friend would probably be executed before his dish would arrive.

When we checked in at the hostess stand, we received an odd look when we said we wanted to eat inside instead of the patio. After about a fifteen minute wait, our pager went off to let us know our table was ready. The person seating us never actually acknowledged us, even though the hostess tried to facilitate an introduction of sorts. Very odd.

After we were seated, we waited for about 10 minutes before a server in another section noticed we hadn't received water, let alone had the opportunity to order drinks/appetizers/anything. Our drinks were comped, which was nice, but then we received way too much attention from everyone working the floor. The food was fine, as we assured everyone who stopped by every two minutes.

At the time of the bill, our server assumed my boyfriend was paying and directed all information toward him, even when picking up the folder that was clearly in front of me.

As I said, the food was fine--nothing spectacular--but the service was enough to make me not want to return."}
{"text":"Terrible for larger parties and I would guess for even smaller ones.

Went there late Sunday afternoon with a group of parents and kids (about 18 of us). With literally 10 people in there, it still took almost 15 minutes to get a table ready. The place was a ghost town, both from a customer and employee perspective.

So not being a restarateur let me point out the numerous mistakes from a patron's perspective:
1. SERVER .ONE server-There's no one else in the place and you still think it's a good idea to have one server for a table of 18? 
2. DRINKS.  Drinks took forever. Honestly, how long does it take to get sodas for the kids? A LONG time. And refills? Ha! It wasn't until we were almost done with dinner that the server finally brought a pitcher with her to refill soda. Alcoholic beverages took even longer.
3. Didn't see a manager ONCE! This is a common theme but with so few people in the place and the length of time it took to get our food, it didn't dawn on the manager that maybe he/she should have come over to apologize or ask if we need anything while our server disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time?
4. CHECK OUT: Getting our checks literally took 30 minutes and when we received them all but one were wrong.  This is just dumb as we told the server at the start who was on which check and she basically said 'I got this' and said she knew who was sitting where. Then when it came time to get checks she literally had to have the boys sit in their exact spots so she 'didn't get confused'. Well that didn't help because she still screwed it up.
5. AUTO-TIP: 20% auto-tip- Complete crap especially considering the horrid pace of service. If this person was good, she would have gotten at least 20% tip from everyone. Instead it certainly seemed like she knew in advance that she was getting her tip so chose not work hard at all. 
6. FOOD: Onion rings were soggy and barely warm (dipping sauce was good though), tomato bisque was decent but would have been really good had it not been lukewarm and every burger order was wrong. Missing cheese on some, missing lettuce, tomato on others and no condiments until about 5 minutes after food was delivered. Average food (at best) but worse with the temperature of it all and the incorrect orders.

We spent $130 for 5 people with only a couple of alcoholic drinks and 2 people only got a few apps (the others got a couple of burgers and some tacos).

Not at all worth the money, especially with the complete lack of service."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the neighborhood and so gave it a try.  It is actually maybe a little better than two stars, more like two and half, but I wouldn't even go to three.

We were seated right away, particularly for a Saturday evening, but after that we ignored for about 10 minutes.  Luckily Elias stepped up and took care of us after that.

I had the Roast Chicken and Sausage - it was OK, but really on the bland side, even the sausage.  The pompe frites that came with it were the best part.  My wife liked her salmon, but she said the mashed potatoes were cold.  They do give you a lot of food thought; we both had leftovers.

And all of that was over $80; rather pricey for what you get.  

I can't imagine why I'd be back."}
{"text":"My friends treated me to the Oak Barrel for my birthday this year and I must say I was pretty impressed. I was a bit nervous to try a different place, but in the end we found a great new gathering place for future events and celebrations. Our waitress was very friendly, The location offers a comfortable floor plan. The food was fresh and packed with flavor. The Happy Hour Drink Menu was a bit disappointing for me, however I would go back and visit again."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!! Being in the food service industry this place was very good , servers knowledgeable and helpful , food quality was fresh and flavorful . Would definitely recommend and return!! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service and beautiful atmosphere. Get a burger and Kentucky bourbon barrel on draft!"}
{"text":"I was happy to stumble upon The Oak Barrel while on a trip to Independence and will definitely make it part of my restaurant rotation when I'm out here! The restaurant is HUGE-two floors, plenty of seating, a nice bar...they can definitely accommodate a larger crowd. I would imagine they do events as well. 

Service: Our waitress was really friendly and attentive in picking up on when we were ready to order, when our drinks needed to be refilled, etc. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, particularly the drink menu, and gave great recommendations.

Food: We started with the soft pretzel, which came with an awesome gouda fondue to dip it in. I was torn between three menu items: the Amish chicken and waffles, the pulled pork with jalepeno corn bread, and the sunny side up burger. I ended up getting the pulled pork with a side of French fries, and it was fantastic. The portion sizes were huge, but I was hungry so I appreciated that."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!   In our party we had the pork chops, ribs, and pizza.   Everyone enjoyed their meals (and the samples we shared between us)!  The white chocolate tiramisu was absolutely the best I ever had!!"}
{"text":"I've been to The Oak Barrel a couple times now. The first time I was impressed by the atmosphere and multiple vegan options on the menu. I enjoyed the vegan falafel tacos and didn't enjoy my Moscow Mule. But in all fairness, Moscow Mules aren't on the menu, so I can't blame the bartender for not knowing how to make one.

I went back recently with my boyfriend and looked forward to having a nice lunch on a blustery winter afternoon. But we were kind of underwhelmed. I ordered a vegan pizza. It was ok...but nothing special. Floppy crust, sauce, a smattering of mushrooms and caramelized onions and a garden full of arugula. I could have made this at home for a lot less than the $14 I paid. (and my crust wouldn't have been floppy)

My boyfriend had a burger. He said the best part of the burger were the truffle fries he got on the side. He didn't even bother finishing it because he was so unimpressed.

Service was a little spotty, too. But it was pretty busy in the restaurant and they seemed to be understaffed. 

Overall, this was an ok experience, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon. I appreciate that there are multiple vegan options, though. So if you're a hungry vegan and happen to be in the area, drop by and get some tacos. But skip the pizza."}
{"text":"Went at 9pm on a Saturday night. I sat in the bar. Service was pretty bad. I ordered the shrimp tacos, had 3-4 of the smallest shrimp imaginable and plenty of slaw filler. My girlfriend got the chicken club sandwich.. Small piece of chicken but plenty of bread. Above average beer selection. I'll try it again on taco night and hopefully will have a better experience."}
{"text":"Just blown away at this place! Oak Barrel is truly a gem of Valley View. 

Just walking up to the restaurant, you're met with inviting smells that smack you in the face. I was excited for our food just based on this. 

The atmosphere is lovely. You cannot at all tell this place was once Hoggy's. Seriously, it looks great. We took advantage of the last of the patio weather before the winter hits and it doesn't disappoint either. They have a great fire pit. 

Before I move along to the food I want to specifically point out that the manager, Kyle, is great. We appreciate our craft beer, and Kyle knows his and can make some great recommendations. He's what all restaurant managers should be. 

We got the duck fat popcorn which is divine. It's basically just greasy delicious popcorn, and a comfort food at its best. I'm kicking myself right now for not ordering an extra to go. 

I opted for the Dr. Pepper Pork Shank and chose a side salad in lieu of the potatoes that come with it. The apple cider vinaigrette is fantastic. But my god the pork? Absolutely fantastic. Fall-off-the-bone and literally one of the best meals I've had at a restaurant. A good enough portion that I had some to savor later on too. Husband got the bacon wrapped steak. His was really good and the glaze that comes with it is to die for. 

Also, their beer menu is fantastic. It's rare that I go to a restaurant that has more than a couple beers that I haven't tried and they had many. I've seen a couple people complain about the beer prices but I got a 22oz bottle for $16 which I find to be extremely reasonable especially for a pricier restaurant. 

Overall just a really enjoyable experience and will definitely come back. Based on the other reviews I can't wait to try their burgers too! I can't imagine why anyone would rate this place less than 4 stars. If you have, I implore you to go back and order the pork shank and see if it doesn't change your opinion."}
{"text":"The food and service is amazing. You have to have the Mead.  There is a lot to choose from around there but this place is a diamond in a desert of disparity. They do great beef but branch out and let one of the hot servers order for you.  Oh ya , try the mead!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food atmosphere and great staff. Went with family everyone from ages 6-65 years old loved there food . Casual dining with high quality tasting food. Will be back again !!"}
{"text":"I hate going to local places and not being able to give a decent rating. With that said, I also hate going out to lunch just my husband and me and spending $50 on a meal that's far below mediocre. The 2 stars I'm giving were for the decor of this place which was so comfy and cozy. Truthfully it was the only good part of our experience. Our service was terrible. My $19 salad had some type of weird, gross onion vinaigrette on it and all I tasted was onions.  I probably would have asked for something different or an exchange but the only time our server came over was to drop our check Off and scurry away once the check hit the table. My husband usually doesn't say anything bad, he's very easy to please, but even he agreed it was a pretty awful meal. Yuck. If you want to pay these prices but actually enjoy a decent meal with friendly service, then Lockkeepers is right up the road."}
{"text":"We weren't from the area and stopped in just because we happened to drive by. What a hidden gem! The service was excellent and while we just had a burger and a club sandwich, they were both cooked to perfection. The bacon and egg on the burger were cooked the exact way they should be, and most restaurants fail to get those things right.  On our way home, we stopped to help a stray dog on the side of the highway and she jumped right in to our car. We drove around looking for the owners (we found them!) but while in the backseat, the dog ate the rest of the club sandwich that we had taken home for later.  We were so disappointed that the dog got the rest of that excellent sandwich! We're considering making another trip there very soon and we are an hour away. It's that good."}
{"text":"Dr pepper braised pork shank is consistently awesome. Kids like the homemade mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I love the location, outside fire pit and have always had awesome servers. My favorite thing to order is the calamari app and veggie burgers. Both are amazing. So are the Ohio beef burgers too, but I have a special place in my heart for the vegan falafel sliders. Some of my favorite house made veggie burgers hands down. (Ewww, remember when this place used to be Hoggy's?? This is such an upgrade!)"}
{"text":"The layout and decor of this place are great - lots of open space, lots of wood and stone elements. One of us ordered a mixed drink that came with an enormous ball shaped ice cube, it looked nice.

My food however was not that great. I tried the tuna tartare and the tuna itself was ok but it was covered in so much sugary sauce that it almost was undesirable. Put the sauce on the side and it would be a great dish. 

I also tried the chicken livers. They were unusually large and heavily breaded, perhaps they were cooked in groups? They were ok but I have had better.

The service was great and parking is super easy. I like the layout and would like to return to try more (hopefully better) dishes."}
{"text":"Real barbecue in Cleveland? Yes, and it's made with superb local meat from New Creation Farm. I've had a couple meals here and sampled the BBQ, sides, and non-BBQ items enough to feel confident about this rave review. The menu is diverse and full of enough finesse and options that non-barbecue fans would be happy, but if you like smoked meat, you really owe it to yourself to get down here. It's out of the way from almost anywhere, but it's also worth the trip."}
{"text":"We've been here more than five times and we really like this place.  The place is clean and modern (even though it is in the old hoggys building).  We have had excellent service every time we've eaten here. The food is really good, especially the tacos (go on taco Tuesday), the chicken and waffles and the lunch salads   They also have some really good  appetizers. I'm not a fan of the duck confit pop corn, but I know many who are.   Although the food is really good.... The beer list is incredible.   They have a Great draft beer selection and a very diverse bottled beer selection.   In all, this place is a keeper!"}
{"text":"Beautiful building. Wonderful service. The menu was had the typical food but all with a unique twist. I had the calamari and the spicy shrimp tacos.  Both were outstanding. I intend on going back. Their menu has many \"must try\" items!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here tonight. Great menu, reasonable prices and terrific staff. I had a check-in offer. Free duck fat popcorn with truffle oil. Yum. I ordered a cocktail off their menu. Bourbon Daisy. Great. Plenty stiff and really tasty. 

I ordered fried chicken and waffles with a side of garlic green beans. Wow!  It comes with blackberry maple syrup. Crispy, juicy perfectly fried chicken on a thyme waffle. This is the best rendition of this dish I've ever had. The green beans were a little underdone for my taste and too salty. The flavors were there but it was a miss.  My server took them off my bill. Very nicely done. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The Oak Barrel is a solid restaurant in the Independence area. The restaurant itself is very clean and well put together. The service was solid but nothing to write home about. A few minor problems but nothing worth noting. 

Stopped in for lunch and enjoyed the tex mex salad. The dressings on the side were very different but delicious. The menu looked very interesting and I will definitely be back to try some different items offered. 

Overall my experience with the Oak Barrel was good and I will be back soon."}
{"text":"the oak barrel is housed in the former hoggy's location on canal road. immediately upon entering you feel like you've stepped into an old barn with 2 levels, fireplaces, wood covered walls and soaring ceiling heights. bar is set off to the side which featured a band the night we dined in.........has a very \"chain restaurant\" feel to it. inexperienced hostesses greet you, have not idea how to seat and call customers to their tables out of order of arrival.....they don't take reservations for groups under 6. 
the beer menu is extensive, a choice of some cocktails on a printed piece of paper, good, but very overpriced for a burger & booze type of atmosphere. their prices for cocktails rival some of the upscale restaurants.  i come to expect to pay higher prices in an upscale restaurant, NOT in a jeans & t-shirt restaurant.

menu has some interesting selections, but i really felt a hunger for something chargrilled, as that scent from the kitchen perfumed the air.
to start with appetizers we had the lobster roll (very average, needs a richer tasting mayo, a more traditonal style \"bun\" and sweeter lobster, it was good, but not memorable.) a sausage plate with chicken sausage, toast and 2 sauces, simple/average, again, chicken livers which were really very good and the best was the calamari with a sweet chile sauce....delicious and plentiful!!!

the salads were next...2 of us ordered the lyonnaise salad, i suggest skipping this one! lots of lightly dressed greens with some caramelized onions, hard boiled eggs and left over cold, sliced potatoes on the side. lyonnaise is a classic french potato dish; this was an interesting twist, but not fully realized yet!
the other 2 guest had the arugula salad....they were happy with theirs, but not overly impressed.
For dinner, i had the hanger steak, prepared perfectly rare, as i ordered, it was neatly sliced on the plate and garnished with some of the worst french fries/pomme frites i've ever had.......little bitty pieces of potato, overly soggy, overly cooked. also on the plate was a homemade steak sauce and i think it was chimmichurri, both gross.  the others at the table had the dr. pepper pork shank, which was loved, a bacon wrapped tenderloin, also loved and a crispy walleye which really turned out to be fish & chips with those terrible fries. the walleye would not have been ordered had it been discribed differently. crispy doesn't make me think of over battered, gummy chunks of fish nuggets.

service was SLOW........SO SLOW that the table next to us asked us if they could have some of our water from the bottle on our table as their server was asked over 15 minutes earlier and never brought them any. 
took a long time for the initial cocktails as the bar was \"backed up\" . that's was our server told us.....took at least 10 minutes to arrive at the table. this was around 9:30 at night....it was busy but not packed.
all around it was OK.....i'd go back for a burger and a beer, but little else. seems like this place wants to be everything to everybody.
it's good for the locals as there are not that many choices in valley view, i gather. 

**one key note.....if you are irritated by cigarette smoke, you have to walk through the gauntlet of smokers hanging out all around the front door, patio and fire pit."}
{"text":"We stopped on a whim on Valentine's Day and were pleasantly surprised. Right away, loved the industrial/rustic decor. We sat at the bar. The bartender was awesome. They were pretty busy and she was very attentive to us. And it just happened to be Taco Tuesday, which was perfect for us, tacos & margaritas. We had Pork, steak and fish taco trio. The menu was creative, we can't wait to try other items. Fantastic wine cellar too. We were very happy we checked it out. Very hip and current. Just our style."}
{"text":"Pretty restaurant and super cute patio. Not much of view but we got to enjoy listening to the music from
the car show next door. Ordered the old fashioned for this is our go to drink and it was watered down and if you know how to make an old fashioned this would be challenging to do, $12 tends to be the norm price for this drink so you usually expect a wow me cocktail and that wasn't the case. My husband ordered a pizza with pork belly and eggs and the pieces with the egg were full of flavor. The Pork belly was in tiny cubes so you couldn't truly get the flavor that you normally would get from this type of meat but overall a solid pie. I wanted the ahi tacos however they were out so we got the spicy shrimp tacos and they were pretty generic and nothing special. Tortilla, lettuce, shrimp and spicy mayo, and it also came with a side of pico that I used on the taco to add flavor and then nothing was left over for the chips that it came with. 

Overall wasn't wowed. Cute space but food and drinks were lacking. Pricey for the quality that you get."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this restaurant due to their gluten free options, but I didn't realize that the food was going to be so fresh and natural. It was a pleasant surprise for sure. I don't get out east very often, so I'm trying to make it a point to hit a restaurants that aren't in my west side bubble, and the Oak Barrel was an excellent choice. 

Atmosphere: I enjoyed the tall ceiling and fire that was visible upon entry. I have a hard time describing the feel of the decor. I think it could be describes as modern or earthy, but either way, I loved the look of this spot.



Service: I really liked our server. He kept his own personality, meaning he wasn't being fake nice, he was being himself, and that made him very likable. Friendly, informative and efficient, it was a pleasure having him as our waiter.

Food: I ordered one goat cheese deviled egg, the kale salad, and mashed potatoes with leek and spinach, (so much more innovative than plain mashed potatoes.)
My friend ordered a cheeseburger with an egg, and fries.
If kale salad isn't done right, the leaves can be rough and chewy. They kale in this salad was perfect. It was complimented with spicy pecans, which were delicious, but as a light weight in spices, I'm glad I had a water glass next to me. The potatoes were creamy, and the added vegetables gave it a good crunch. My deviled egg was a good blend of cheese and slices.
My friend throughly enjoyed his burger, though he couldn't finish it in one sitting. 

Prices were a little high. Granted, high prices usually mean quality food, but this isn't a spot for a cheap lunch.

Next time I'm in this area I will definitely hit up the Oak Barrel again."}
{"text":"Nice brew pub/happy hour surroundings...lots of wood.  Spacious.   Great beer selection and size choices.  Had the Amish Chicken and waffles, very tasty and the small was ample sized.   Parking lot looked full at about 6:30 on a Thursday, but was seated immediately.   Recommended."}
{"text":"I came here last night with a group of 15 co-workers for dinner. I travel frequently and I took a chance bringing the group here as I'd never been here myself. I am very impressed with everything about this place. Very creative menu (how about bacon wrapped dates with bread cheese and a chili thrown on the smoker?). For dinner, I had the smoked pork shank and was blown away. Simply sublime. Our server handled a group of boisterous business travelers with ease. Liked it so much, I'm back tonight for the Chicken and Waffles. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love a restaurant with a different menu, put chicken and waffles on it somewhere, and I am there! Against my better judgement, I did not order the chicken and waffles. Why, is beyond me.

The Yelp deal included a free duck fat popcorn to satisfy our appetizer fancy. I have to say, aside from being incredibly greasy, I was impressed by the flavor. Very different yet delicious. I am glad it was free, though, since it's not something I would likely order on my own.

I ended up having the open faced pulled pork sandwich. It was tasty. However, I was unfairly comparing it to an open faced meatloaf sandwich I had recently that blew the pulled pork out of the water. I realize it's two different dishes, but if the meatloaf made me feel as if I could die after eating it and be happy, the pulled pork should have been just as awesome. Not so much. I did still enjoy it, so don't let my last comment deter you. My boyfriend had the sunny side up burger and was in heaven. He considers himself quite the burger connoisseur, so that is quite a compliment. All in all it was a good place. I would return but I'm not running out to eat more things with duck fat."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommend by a friend.  I am on a business trip, and it worked out for me to stop.  I ordered the open-faced pulled pork sandwich.  It was excellent!  I like the atmosphere too -nice, but casual."}
{"text":"Good service, reasonable prices, excellent barbecue! Beer list is pretty extensive with good variety. Cool atmosphere and nice patio area for those wanting to dine outside. Popped in while traveling, happy that I did and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"EXCEPTIONAL!! Everything was delicious. The popcorn  was savory and flavor in every bite. If you're a \"foodie\" this is must try. If you're not, visit and wake your taste buds up. Can't wait to go back and try other items. Psssst! Try the crab balls."}
{"text":"Bomb.com over here! Definitely will be back for another turkey burger! I must admit I did not care for the fries. Very thick and more like potato chunky if that makes sense. I prefer a crispy & thinner fry, that's just me! Front of the house was very nice, I was only ordering to-go... Super cute ambiance too by the way, loved the tree and other Xmas decor!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by Oak Barrel. Have hosted a few out of town guests there and they've all enjoyed it.

Although they have excellent BBQ, tonight I needed lighter fare. The arugula salad with beets, goat cheese and candied walnuts was spot on. And a creamy bowl of tomato bisque rounded out my meal. Hubby enjoyed the walleye po'boy. He enjoyed it, but the huge portion of fish made neat eating difficult. 

One of the best features is the excellent draft beer menu. I went with Dragon's Milk - roar! I really appreciate their 6oz portions that allow for tasting or just that little bit more to go with dessert.

Speaking of dessert... I don't usually splurge that much, but tonight I had the flourless chocolate torte. The torte itself was superb. But they could have held off on the chocolate drizzle (aka lathering). And the carmelized bacon could have been fine in small bits, but they went overboard here too."}
{"text":"Raw pizza, bland fries nd tasteless onion rings made our first visit to the Oak Barrel our last.  Really there isn't much to like in this place.  The menu is good but the execution is awful.  No one in our party of 5 enjoyed their entire meal - there was something wrong with at least one item on each person's plate. Complete fail."}
{"text":"This is a terrific restaurant with a wide menu of excellent food. The hamburgers, ribs and salads are especially good. The BBQ sauce is so good we brought home three quarts. And our waitress Kathleen was efficient, kind and very friendly."}
{"text":"Went for Mothers Day and they were very accommodating to our party of 10. Service was great, food was very good and the atmosphere was friendly. Definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and it is always good but tonight we ate at the bar and the service and food was over the top.  The bartender (laurie or laura) was simply a pleasure and totally on her game.  And hearing her interacting with the other staff members it was clear she was just pleasant, helpful and efficient.

I know this sounds gross to some - but give it a try: the chicken livers with pork over polenta ROCK!

We are in town about once a month and I will definitely go back here again!!!  It was a really nice way to spend a Monday evening!"}
{"text":"We (family of three) have enjoyed a couple dinners here. Love the creative menu. But we called over a couple Sundays ago about 6:00 p.m. to bring our middle school basketball champs to celebrate. They told us it would be fine, table for 20. We asked the waitress to separate checks by team members jersey number . She didn't like that idea and told us we couldn't move from our seats so she could memorize the order for food and drinks. Well that was a horrid mistake because she screwed up every single tab. We - my husband,son and myself, didn't even get one at the end of the night. We had to tell her to bring us one. Food was available and delicious but service was sooo slow. I mentioned to the waitress she might want to get some help but she turned her nose up at the suggestion. The assistant manager brought a few drinks but we didn't get out of there until very late. She was apologetic."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with The Oak Barrel. Walked in and got seated right away. Lots of non-meat options on the menu! And there are three sizes for draft beers; 6oz, 12oz and 16oz.. I had the vegan falafel burger with fries. The service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Oh man, I really wanted to like this place! Tried this restaurant out for a girl's night out prior to a comedy show. Let's just get into it....

The pros:
*Ambiance. Sadly, this is about all this place has going for it. The ambiance is great, the seating is plentiful, and we were sure that we were in for a great meal.

The cons:
*The food. Listen, the food is fine. There are alot of options on the menu and we had a hard time choosing what to order. We asked several people for recommendations and everyone said they're known for their burgers. So, that's what we had. Everything was fine. Just....fine. No flavor. No seasoning. Nothing special. 
*Price. At first glance, the prices seem fine but after having the less-than-steller food, their prices seem way too high. Moreover, our plates were going back to the kitchen with well over half of the food still present on them. Our app plate went back barely touched. Not one person asked us if there was a problem or whether we had enjoyed our meal.

What else can I say about this place? After paying upwards of $30 each, we went on to our show hungry and stopped for a meal on the way home."}
{"text":"Are they padding their reviews???? This place is not worth these stars. I came here first many years ago when it first opened. Back then in one of the articles about it's opening it was made clear it was associated with aladdins in that the owners are business partners. Well aladdins name is being tarnish by how horribly bad this place is.... We were seated and waited ... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited.... the place was not even half full so it was not that they were busy. I got up and went to the host stand and asked if we were seated in an area without a server assigned to it.... Finally someone came out... The other person eating had to keep changing their order cause everything they wanted had something cooked into it they did not want... The turkey burger has onion cooked into it... Every single server was young and attractive servers... sort of a hipster vibe to them all... but young and hipster does not a good server make... young and hipster does not a brain make. This place reeked of poor management in every single aspect. What about when we did get out food... I Ordered a thincrust/flatbread pizza... The crust was so thin and so soggy and so pilled with cheese and tomato that the minute I picked it up the entire thing fell apart. I couldn't eat one piece without using my hands to tear it apart or a fork and knife. For the price I paid they had better be kidding me. I don't get how this place stays in business. If you are the owner or gm reading this please dont blame the server... it is not their fault IT IS  YOUR FAULT.  Blame yourself. Mcdonalds trains their employee's better. Next time we drive up the road to Yours Truly... a well run local restaurant."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday!  Need I say more?  Went here with a group, and everyone was happy with their food.  We got the calamari which was excellent to start with.  I got the house salad which tasted really fresh and then we all got....you guessed it! Tacos!!! There is NO modifications on tacos at the special $2/$3 price- so you are not able to add OR take anything away from them.  I LOVED the spicy shrimp tacos and friends enjoyed those along with ahi and chicken.  Getting our food was a little slow but our server was great.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time at oak barrel saturday and it def exceeded my expectations... Service could not have been better, waitress was super nice and helpful. Excellent drink selection, crab appetizer was great, and the dr pepper marinated pork shank was literally the best pork dish Ive had in my life.  Got seated right away around 630pm on a sat which was also a pleasant surprise!  I would def return!"}
{"text":"Food was quite good and the ambiance of the dining room was also very nice. The service was top notch as well."}
{"text":"(belated post) came here this summer. They have a good (craft) beer offering and the service was great. Got a half rack with fries and slaw. The ribs themselves were middle of the road and probably wouldn't get again for the price, tbh. The slaw had an asian flare to it, which was surprising but kept it nice and light (vs Mayo). I'd be slightly curious how the other items on the menu are but doubt I'll be back since it's not close by."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love this place. The food is amazing and so are the servers. However, the bar is ALWAYS behind. I HIGHLY recommend ordering two drinks at one time because you won't get your drinks until your meal comes out. With this being said, the kitchen is very fast and the bar is very slow. If you're trying to have cocktails before dinner I wouldn't recommend this place, but if you want reasonably priced drinks and delicious fast service food then you should definitely eat here!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed ringing in the new year at one of my favorite restaurants, Oak Barrel. This restaurant has a large menu that offers a variety of foods from small plates to barbecue, tacos to sandwiches. A great appetizer to start with is the soft pretzel. It's warm and salty and comes with delicious beer cheese and mustard dipping sauces. I really enjoy their club sandwich which has an entire chicken breast on it. The honey mustard is a great addition to the sandwich. You can't go wrong with either their fries or their to die for mac and cheese. Better yet, do what I did and get both. Plan to take leftovers home. The portion sizes are generous. They also have an extensive bar. Drinks are a little pricey but worth it. The decor is a mix of classic wood and modern metals. Even the quote on the wall in the women's restroom is inspiring. I'd definitely suggest trying out Oak Barrel when you're looking for a fun and different dinner spot."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and wanting to eat some really tasty food I highly recommend this place. From the moment you walk in you can smell all of the great food and spices. The beer list is also very large, but somewhat pricey. Regardless, I would recommend the duck fat popcorn, and the steak tacos...SO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"The menu looks great...however they cant execute it. Party of four, had their chicken salad (was ok but what should you expect from that), chicken and waffles (the small portion of chicken was dry and not seasoned). The worst part was the \"carne asada tacos\" ...wheres the beef ~ see the photos. Slow service and understaffed...ugh...nice try."}
{"text":"After my experience at The Oak Barrel, all I can say is \"Holy artisan delicacies, Batman!!\" Chef Demetrios Atheneos is nothing short than the Michaelangelo of the hailed gastropub trend. Their menu prides itself on only the best ingredients and you can taste that pride in every dish. We had the devils on horseback as a starter and my husband, who usually steers clear of pork, couldn't stop raving about these morsels. For drinks, I stuck with my favorite--the old fashion--this one complete to tradition to the very last drop with giant round ice cubes. My husband had two beers from their extensive beer list. After snacking and drinking and relaxing in their barn-right-out-of-a-Danielle-Steele-novel atmosphere, we finished off with the chicken and waffles and hanger steak, both flavorful, creative, and well cooked. The food was divine and the service, though sweet and attentive, needs a little bit more education on what this place has to offer. All in all, a truly amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Food is good and the upstairs is great for a party/get together. It has great ambiance. I've only ever been for get togethers/networking, but enjoyed the appetizers and old fashioned drinks."}
{"text":"Great tacos....good atmosphere!   Will definitely  make this a favorite!  Was going to a movie and the server  make an extra effort to get us out on time!"}
{"text":"Nothing overt to find fault with, but I didn't leave anticipating my next visit. Decent burger. Excellent fries, and their herbed popcorn is also very good. Nice plus is being able to order a 6oz beer to try something out. I will probably go again, as it is close to the movie theater, but I wouldn't make the trek to Valley View just to eat there."}
{"text":"Simply put - Delicious, creative, eclectic, and very original options. You'll enjoy whatever you choose."}
{"text":"As we put out names in and asked about the wait, they did not really have a time frame for us. We were told they were waiting on a party to leave and we would get there table. This party was to be leaving soon as they had been there for two hours. After 20 minutes, we went back to ask for a time frame as we had small children and would need to figure out a plan b if needed. We were told 30 more minutes. Again, we waited. After 30 more minutes, we were told 10 more. My husband noticed that there were some empty tables in their covered patio section where others were seated to the manager. His response, \"oh, did you want to sit out there?\" Um.. Ya it is better than starving out here. Once we sat down, the waitress was polite and did her best to get our food out quickly. The food was ok similar to any chain type food. Nothing spectacular and yet nothing terrible either. It would have been three stars if not for our initial issue."}
{"text":"From the outside, the building looks average, but once you walk in from a bitter cold Ohio winter day, this massive open floor plan dining room surprises you. The menu especially will take you to the next level. From burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, and tacos, and a massive list of beers on tap, you can't be disappointed. 
I couldn't resist trying everything, so we got truffle fries and tacos for appetizers, and a burger and pizza for entrees. Incredible flavor all around!
I suggest the Dragon Milk sundae afterwards. It features a special ice cream specially made for the restaurant by Mitchell's and only served here. 
The overall atmosphere is very hip, including a young, uptempo playlist always playing. At the same time, it's a very warm cozy atmosphere to dine in.
Definitely worth grabbing dinner and then a movie next door at the awesome Valley View Cinemark theatre afterwards."}
{"text":"Really good food. I have been here on multiple occasions and can say their food is really good. From their Dr. Pepper pork shank, pulled pork with jalapeño corn bread, crab balls, polenta to their peach hot tea. Interior and decorations are also very nice. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was very average. Kinda bland and boring. Butchers plate had some bland sausage, what appeared to be some average deli capicolla, bland spreads, and bland pickled vegetables. Burger was cooked ok but yet again...bland, no seasoning.  If you hate salt and flavor than this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend to a going away party for a co worker.The atmosphere with the lighting and the wood work on the walls had a nice warm touch to it.The drink list had a nice variety.We had a couple of mixed drinks and a few beers to start.The drinks were good.The group I was with ordered some of the appetizers which I recommend.All of them were delicious. Shortly after the appetizers my girlfriend and I ordered some food.I had some baby back ribs but was disappointed that the ribs were not consistently heated all the way thru.Some sections of them were cold but the fries I got were nice and crispy.My girlfriend ordered the shrimp tacos which I tried and they were good.I rated this place a three because I was not blown away for the money you are paying.I will give it a second chance to win my over in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent service and an interesting menu.  They offer dishes with twists, but don't get so cute with that they ruin it.  I'd go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices. Atmosphere was really cool, modern rustic. Fun bar area. I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 bc drinks were a bit expensive - $14 for my cocktail. They had some vegan options, so I was thrilled."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the bourbon daisy cocktail! If you aren't a bourbon fan, this is a great way to start!"}
{"text":"So me and my buddy checked this place out a few months back and I'm just now getting to my review, yes the prices are a little pricey for what it seems but I and my friend thought the food was GREAT! 

We had gotten an appetizer apiece, a
Entree apiece and a few beers and Meade.

The beer was tasty, I had Hefeweizen and he had a few different choices with Meade which was tasty.

For appetizers I got the tuna tare tare and he had gotten the thai calamari.

The tuna tare tare was DELICIOUS, some of the best I have ever had flavorful, fresh and just damn tasty! The calamari was also very tasty, but me and him both agreed we prefer traditional fried calamari with marinara, the calamari was good though!

I had a burger that was pretty standard fried burger but was tasty and hit the spot, his pizza was pretty good and we both very much enjoyed our visit. I will return!"}
{"text":"I'm torn about The Oak Barrel.  The space is nice - I never visited the restaurant that used to be here, but I would imagine this is an improvement.  The bar/lounge area is large and very welcoming and if I ever make it back, that is where I would see myself having the best time.

The menu has a lot of duplications from Deagan's.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just that I expected it to be a different restaurant.  The duck fat popcorn was a stand-out dish - so good.  Everything else was just ok - we had tacos and sandwiches, neither of them stood out.  

The drink list has some interesting choices.  I really enjoyed my barrel-aged old fashioned.  That and the popcorn may be the only redeeming things for me. The other drinks we tried (that weren't pre-made) seemed too ambitious for the people making them - especially the Perfect Tuxedo, which had several ingredients including absinthe and maraschino liqueur.  I have no problem paying for a good drink.  Charging $14 and $15 is a little crappy when it seems your staff needs a little more training on how to make them properly, though.

So, the end of the night - 3 drinks, popcorn, an appetizer, a sandwich and tacos - over $100. We could have eaten at a lot of high-end places for that price and it just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Overpriced, but good.

That's my tagging for Oak Barrel, and it's reinforced every time I end up here.  It still smells like the BBQ place it used to be.  It's an extremely hip and inviting restaurant on the inside that makes you want to like it more than you do.  There's not much else in the valley quite like it, but W 25th and Tremont aren't that far of a hike.

Last excursion was a lunch meeting, and we went light, with a white fish po boy and tuna tacos.  The po boy didn't come on the traditional French baguette and the tuna tacos were good, but most of the flavor came from the guacamole.  

I've drank here before too, and they have a good selection, built definitely top of the market prices.    

If they were to knock a couple bucks off the meals and better drink specials, this could be a real winner."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and so far both times we have had a great time. It seems rare that you get both 5 star food and service but we hit the jackpot here. We came here to get a bite to eat and a drink before a movie we were seeing next door. We let the bartender know this and asked to cash out ahead of time so we could leave when we were done eating. She was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed quickly. We ordered a burger and fries to share and our food came out amazingly fast. Very rarely do I get burgers cooked to my exact specification of medium but this time it was cooked exactly right. It was juicy and everything I wanted it to be. The fries were nice and thick and seasoned with a truffle oil and parmesan cheese. I can't wait to try all the other items they have to offer."}
{"text":"It seems a lot like the old Deagan's menu but with more options. They still do Taco Tuesday so that made me happy. I used to take my mom to the Deagan's one and I enjoyed the cilantro they used. I am glad that they still make the tuna taco here. It is really good. The vegan and beef tacos are also good. A lot of the other stuff on the menu seems pricey but it is what is. The beer selection is great. My friend had one on a lunch break which I admire."}
{"text":"We (11 of us) went today for Mother's Day. It took over 30 minutes for our apps. The baked brie was awful and not worth the $. Our meals took about 1 hour and 15 minutes, except one burger which came out after most of use were done eating. The manager got involved and gave us a $50 gift card...for 11 people's meals, drinks and apps. I have been here 2x in the past and the food and service was great. I would NEVER go on a holiday. Today was really disappointing."}
{"text":"Simply great food and outstanding atmosphere in an area of suburban Cleveland in need of exactly this type of place.  Go here if you live within 10 miles of here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not coming back.  While the wait to be seated was short,  the food took an hour and fifteen minutes to be served.  The food was average.   the drinks were overpriced. I  can get that at a local steakhouse"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Sunday, was pretty quiet, but some people were sitting outside.  It looks like the place would be really nice at night, with all the lights and what looks to be a fire pit outside.  The food was ok.  I ordered the fish medium rare, and it came medium well to well done.  There wasn't much flavor, and the bottom was overly seared to the point it was almost fried.  The vegetables, however, were nice and fresh.  The lamb burger wasn't big, but it was tasty.  One complaint is that they charged me $2 to replace my side, even though I replaced it with a side of equal value.

I'd come back to try the salads, as I saw a few go by that looked really fresh and beautiful.  It seems they have a good selection of beer, so we may have to come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but a little overpriced for the quality you get.  I enjoyed it, but I probably wouldn't go here again unless I was given a gift card."}
{"text":"Place looks really cool.  Their patio looks awesome but it's been freezing in Cleveland so that isn't going to be enjoyed for a while. 

I got the fish tacos and they were ok.  Perfect size actually and the shrimp was good, guacamole was just ok.

They have a good drink selection so think it would be a good place for happy hour.

Service was good, food fast, place was busy.  I just wasnt starving so maybe I'd hit a home run with another option on the menu."}
{"text":"Nestled between Quaker Steak and Lube and the old Champs, Valley View seems to be where restaurants go to die. I came here by a stroke of luck; I was craving bacon-wrapped dates and bacon-wrapped dates this place had. My strange craving for dates is now going to be the start of a long-term relationship with this great place. Don't let the theater traffic and empty space deter you; this pace is worth a trip.

So, the dates or devils on horseback...everything I'd hoped for. I could have eaten 5 portions by myself, but for $8 a plate...not so much. Luckily, I was hungry for more than just small plates. I ordered an oak barrel burger which was topped with cheddar, pickled onions, and the usual burger condiments. The buns are homemade and just exploded into buttery baked goodness in my mouth. The burger was tender and had just the right bun-to-burger-to-condiment ratio. My SO ordered the cuban sandwhich, an equally delicious feast. To compliment our delicious sandwiches, this place bestowed us with the intense vinegary present of homemade pickles...yum!

The drink list is extensive and full of specialties and crafts I haven't seen anywhere else. I ordered a chai mead because where else would I ever find a chai mead? It was heavenly.  If you want dessert, they offer a brownie sundae topped with dragon's milk ice cream; it's the perfect top-off to an impressive meal. The variety of food/beers, the quality of the food, and the fast service makes this place hard to resist. The place is open and decorated beautifully, so it makes for a great casual date spot."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I ate a kafta burger there that was cooked perfectly. I ate at the bar and the bartender was this super friendly girl. She was really attentive and she even helped me decide what to order. I loved that place. I eventually came back with my mom. I would recommend going here on a weeknight because the weekend is so busy it's nuts."}
{"text":"Last night was about the 6th time visiting here in the past couple years, and unfortunately my poorest experience.  Based on last night, I will probably stay away for a while.

I love the vibe and want the place to succeed, but the food quality is regressing and that's a big problem.

I ordered the Cuban sandwich.  The bread was very chewy, and the crust lacked any sense of crispness/crunch.

The fries on my plate were grease logged to the point they looked gray.

One friend had the chicken and waffles and commented the chicken was dried out.  The other friend ordered the fish and chips and had to peel away the batter in spots to be edible.

Bad night at the fryer I suppose?  But even Mel's Diner wouldn't mess up the fries this bad."}
{"text":"My expectations for this place were really exceeded. 

The restaurant is nicely decorated - a major renovation from when it used to be Hoggie's I believe... There is an upstairs area with a large TV. It must be a party space as they were not seating there. There were also spacious patio areas, but obviously not in use when I visited in December. The main floor with a fireplace was also large, and there was no wait for a table at 5:30pm on a Tuesday. By the time we were leaving however, the double turquoise Chesterland couch was full of people waiting for a table. 

The menu is extensive. We ordered a Baked Bavarian Pretzel as an appetizer. This came with two dippings sauces - a gruyere cheese fondue and an upland brewing wheat ale mustard. The pretzel was cooked well, not burnt, but could have been more evenly salted. As a second appetizer we ordered the Butcher's Block off the Chalkboard menu (not listed online). This menu addendum item was served on a wooden paddle and contained a delicious assorted of somewhat unrecognizable items. There was a gooey purple blob that was explained to be caramelized onions. There were candied nuts, pickles, and other goodies. Only one meat item was present however, which is one area for improvement. 

When it came time for mains, I ordered the Bacon Wrapped Beef Tenderloin. I didn't have high expectations for a steak at this restaurant, but I was blown away. The meat was cooked perfectly as I requested at medium+. The steak was served in the center of blue cheese whipped mashed potatoes. On the steak was arugula. The bacon piece was not fatty and all the flavors melded perfectly together! 

The other entree ordered was the Woodstone Roasted Icelandic Cod. For having all those pretentious names, it was a simple and tasty dish. It was served with braised leek and spinach potatoes and a non-spicy Chimichurri sauce. 

Overall the good was great and the kitchen service fast and the waitress service attentive. I will definitely try something else here soon."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual lunch! Good beers on tap, very friendly service and the food is great!"}
{"text":"If you're around the Independence area, highly recommend this place.  The decor is really cool, service and food was great.  If you only have enough real estate for one choice, go for the duck confit mac&cheese = splendid.  The braised pork shank is also highly recommended.  Can't go wrong with their large plate specialties.  Tried their pizza and other non large plates specialties and its OK wasn't that impressed.  

Overall this place is convenient since its right next to a nice theater.  The quality of the ingredients they use taste very fresh.  The salad in their sides taste fresh and some dishes even include use of micro greens.  

Recommendations:
- Arrive early or prepare to wait, its worth it
- Get that Duck Confit mac&cheese
- Dr. Pepper pork shank
- Get some dranks (ie ciders)"}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Fresh and well prepared, quick service....have started to eat here regularly and it has been consistently great....not cheap, but you get what you pay for in this circumstance....well sourced food, and you can taste it...."}
{"text":"I've read complaints that the menu feels like a replay from another restaurant but honestly i'm glad that we are getting more creative fare away from downtown. I have no major complaints about the restaurant but things just felt a bit off overall. The restaurant itself has a nice chalet feel and some of the tables are structured so multiple groups of diners can sit together which I love.

Started off with the truffled popcorn and the calamari. The truffled popcorn had a major oil slick coating but it was definitely tasty. The calamari on the other hand was disappointing, breading was soft, and they pre-dress the calamari with the sauces so it makes it already soggier and generally overpowering. Entrees were much better, I had the chicken and waffles and my husband had the beef tenderloin. His was well cooked and probably one of the best steaks we've had at that price point. My chicken and waffles were overall good, my only critique would be that the waffle was heavy on the cinnamon which made the combination with chicken and syrup jarring.

I ended up taking the waffle home and eating it with ice cream. :)

We'll probably be back to give the menu another shot. Would give it 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I have high expectations of local eateries when I travel.  The Oak Barrel almost qualifies for great place to eat and come back.
Taco Tuesday's are featured weekly and there are some great combinations!  The tuna tacos are fabulous as are the chicken.  Disappointing me were the steak tacos.  Could of been the chef that day, but my first set was stone cold to the touch.  Manager quickly rectified the issue with a new pair, still luke warm at best.
Warm atmosphere, inviting decor keeps this place from sinking lower.  Staff is helpful and always walking checking on things.
Menu included burgers (which I should of ordered) which I plan on having on my next visit to town."}
{"text":"Our group thought this was a decent experience, but not a place where we would return.

Service is friendly and attentive, the space is just ok, and food was disappointing.

The people working are not the issue, and the drab, dark and cliché look of the space could be overlooked if the food were better.

Our group started with the calamari, and it was pretty good. For our mains, it was a mix of sandwiches, tacos, and burgers. I ordered the open faced pulled pork and was so saddened by the pile glopped on my plate that I needed to go home and look at rainbows and unicorns to cheer me up. 

For a place that is supposed to be known for their BBQ, they missed it completely. The meat was HORRIBLY overdressed, and the sauce was a bad mix of sweet and hot. It might not have been that bad had it not come on top of a piece of cornbread the size of a postage stamp. I mean, there was probably at least a half pound of meat and onion straws, 5 lbs of sauce, and a teeny tiny piece of cornbread. If you're going to put that much meat on a plate, have heartier cornbread or give me a bun. It didn't even taste that great.

There are much better places in the area where I could waste my money."}
{"text":"Onion rings are really good especially with the spicy mayo (not that spicy). It is a generous size so have it with a group, not solo. The ribs....are seriously amazing! Fall off the bone, smoky flavor and loaded with sauce. Half rack will stuff one person easily without eating the sides. Being from Texas I had little expectations but I was seriously blown away."}
{"text":"The food is good...that being said, not that busy and we were seated upstairs isolated from the rest of the restaurant. The server was new, only had 2-3 tables max including ours, never asked if we wanted another cocktail when we were done with the first one ordered. Didn't get a water refill until we were done and ready for the check. When the check came, the $24 pork chop I ordered was $32 because I didn't want the polenta and asked for double veggies instead. Not being told there was an up charge I questioned the cost and was told it was for the extra vegetables. Definitely not a $32 pork chop and we will not be back because the owner had no intention of addressing the issue until we said we would be back. We love great food and have NO problem spending money fine dining but we could have gone somewhere much more upscale for the cost of dinner with much better service."}
{"text":"Came out for lunch for friends bday celebration.  And started with brie and melba and fresh fruit  and ruined the healthy fruit with onion rings and a spicy sauce.  Huge rings but not crispy  for lunch. Girlfriend ordered fish and chips and her hubby got Dr Pepper braised pork shank. He said could have licked the plate it was so delish.  Fiance ordered ribs and fries and didn't leave anything on bones..  I ordered a side salad and dressing was delish and ordered a side of cheesy polenta  enough to share that  need to save room for movie popcorn"}
{"text":"very nice place and diverse menu. The vegan tacos are quite good and the fries look very tasty. I like that the ice tea is brewed from leaf tea. We have had their vegan pizza, but I think its off the menu now. They normally have some seasonal vegetables for side dishes which is a nice touch. The prices are a little high, but its a bit higher level than a casual place. Service is normally pretty good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend I have heard good things about a new restaurant called the Oak Barrel, so we decided to eat there last night. It was one of the most enjoyable, satisfying dining out experiences we've had in a long time.  Walking in, we were very impressed with the decor, and it's obvious that whoever had the vision for the layout has great style and truly wants the guests to have an amazing time. Our server, Sarah, was extremely polite and pleasant, which is a nice change from some of the lackluster service we've received elsewhere. She knew the menu well, made some great suggestions, and really gave top quality service throughout the meal. The pork shank is absolutely delicious, and I could eat the shrimp tacos all day. Stellar beer and cocktail list, and the flourless gluten free chocolate torte was simply delectable. We will definitely be back, and would highly recommend the Oak Barrel as a wonderful new gastropub that I'm sure will enjoy much success in the future."}
{"text":"My wife and I went out to dinner at the Oak and Barrel because the website and menu. The decor and atmosphere was very inviting. The overall noise level was fairly high making it difficult to hear each other when sitting at a high top.  The beer selection was good, but some of the bottled craft beers were ridiculously priced.  We started with the onion rings which didn't have much flavor, but the dipping sauce saved them. My wife had the pork shank which had very sweet sauce with a slight hint of pepper.  The side of vegetables were also very sweet and the mashed potatoes tasted premade. I had the night's special which was stuffed pork tenderloin with mashed potatoes and brussell sprouts.  Although tasty the pork eas slightly over cooked, but the brussel sprouts didn't even come clise to aldente and with very little flavor.  Management was kind enough to remove the pork shank from the bill.  I don't think we will he going back."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner before a hockey game and had a mixed experience that I would give 3.5 stars. The place was pretty empty because it was so early, so getting a table wasn't a problem. I loved the lighting and the overall feel of the place, but it was really chilly inside and the music was too loud for the number of people there.

They no longer carry any of the meads they had listed on their drink menu, so we started off with beer and scarlet margaritas which were both good. We split an order of the Kentucky bourbon barrel onion rings and the small order of duck fat popcorn. Both were tasty, but I think the onion rings blew away the popcorn. They were so big that they looked like cruller doughnuts. The batter was crisp and the onion inside was thick and almost meaty. They came with a spicy mayo dipping sauce. I would seriously come back to sit at the bar and order just these, but onion rings are probably my number one guilty pleasure.

Our dinner orders included the Amish chicken and waffles and the Dr. Pepper braised pork shank. The chicken and waffles was okay, but I thought the chicken was dry and the waffle tasted a little like burnt oil. Something was just slightly off about the flavor. The pork shank, however, was delicious...the meat fell off the bone and the sauce was flavorful.

Our service was really disappointing. The host came off as arrogant instead of welcoming. Our server was attentive when we arrived...quick with water and drinks...but after our appetizers arrived, we barely saw her. Our drinks were empty for at least 15 minutes and our empty appetizers plates were still on the table even after we'd paid the bill. Given the prices at Oak Barrel, I kind of expected more from the experience. Those onion rings, though..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to oak barrel. Our server was nice, soft spoken, but nice. They sat us at a huge tavle. There were 6 adults and 3 children and the table sat about 25. They put another family at the other end of the table. We ordered our food and it took forever. Finally, we see a food runner walk by with 2 servings of chicken and waffles which we ordered and give it to the group next to us. They must have ordered it too? The rest of the food for our party came out which was wrongly made, and the 2 adults that ordered chicken and waffles didn't eat with us. It came out about 15 minutes later and it was awful.  They obviously rushed it. My sister ordered a medium burger with well done bacon. Her bacon was grossly undercooked and her burger was so well done it was like a rock. They also brought her regular fries and she asked for truffle. I had chicken tacos and they were good. No manager ever came over to apologize to us or the people next to us since we all ate at different times. There were 2 managers walking around and they did nothing. Our waitress brought us free dessert and that was all. Never going back"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm writing a lot of 5 star reviews nowadays and it just makes me happy because it means Cleveland is impressing me left and right!! The Oak Barrel did just that last night - I walked in impressed by the ambiance and overall look of the place and left thoroughly impressed by the whole experience! Everything from the rustic decor and service to the food and cocktails were wonderful! 

This was a place I was shocked to find in Valley View next to the Cinemark theater. I was heading to a movie with a friend later that night and we decided to grab dinner at Oak Barrel. It's ADORABLE! I came with a friend, but I could definitely see this as a cute date night spot, too!! Even a great birthday dinner place with friends! I wish the weather was warmer outside so we could have had drinks by the fire pit outside on their couches! But, we settled on staying indoors thanks to the 30 degree weather. 

DRINKS: 
Delicious cocktails. I had the Scarlet Margarita, which wasn't all too sweet at all and had the perfect kick. Love blood orange so loved that this was made with blood orange juice. My friend had the Bloody Sangria which was also really good - I just preferred my margarita.

FOOD: 
We started off with the Baked Brie appetizer. 5 stars for appearance and 5 stars for taste for sure!!! Two individual medium sized brie pieces wrapped in pastry dough and baked to perfection. So flaky, so soft, and so good! The crostinis that were served with the Brie were thin, crispy, perfectly seasoned and delicious as well. The plate also had honey, apricots, strawberries, and blackberries. 
I opted for the Vegan Falafel sliders. Again, the appearance was amazing as was the taste! Whatever chili sauce they used was delicious with the perfect kick and I could have definitely used a side of that to dip my sliders in! The fries were great, too.
My friend ordered the Pulled Pork BBQ and loved it! It was an insane amount of meat and she definitely had leftovers for 1-2 more meals!

SERVICE:
Wonderful - everything came out in a timely manner. The waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. The overhead fan was on extremely high and our table and a few others must have mentioned that it was quite chilly and they were very responsive in immediately turning off the fan. 

Overall, I had a great experience at Oak Barrel - I wish this was located in an area like downtown or Ohio City or Tremont. I would love to start out with dinner and drinks here before walking to other places to grab drinks for a night out! Regardless, I know where I'll be grabbing food the next time I'm going to a movie or looking for a place in Valley View!"}
{"text":"It was the perfect halfway spot for my best friend and I to meet once he got back from Colorado on break. Huge parking lot, cabin-style restaurant. There's an upstairs, downstairs, and bar area. The lighting in the building is what makes it for me- it feels like a cozy cabin you would find near the mountains. Aside from that, the menu options are al great. You cannot go wrong with anything you choose. I always get a burger here because they're cooked perfectly. The Mac n cheese is a must get."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times, and for the money I think there are better options.  It has very few actual good meals, most just have a fancy name but are quite bland in taste.  I am not sure why this place gets better than a 3 star average other than people giving it good reviews because they love the over popular vintage/industrial decor.  This place is past it's prime and I'm not sure how it stays in business other than location.  If you ask me save yourself a few (and by few I mean several dollars) and go across the street to Your's Truly!"}
