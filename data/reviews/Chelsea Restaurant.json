{"text":"Nothing spicy or adventurous.  Just home cooked food served at a very leisurely pace.  You can bring your own wine (reasonable corkage) and will want to do that if you are looking for some choices.
I would love to see the owners invest in refreshing the decor, because this is an excellent concept...unpretentious dining in a house converted to resto with a very pleasant host."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little corner of Port Credit, this place is a gem. Inside the heritage home, the decor gives a very warm and cozy feel. The service was great! The owner (Mr. Lee) was genuine and accommodating. This place offers a very casual atmosphere without the pretense. The service can be slow but it's understandable since this is a family restaurant. His lovely wife is in the kitchen.

The food was definitely good! We had a 3 course dinner for $25. Pretty good deal! The soup and homemade pie were tasty. They don't offer a lot but what they offered was enough. The only negative was that there weren't a lot of desserts to choose from at the end of the night. They just ran out. Your choices can be limited to what they have left. We didn't mind this at all.

This place has character, from the building to the food. Try it with an open mind and just enjoy the evening/lunch. We sure did!"}
{"text":"Cool feel at an old house made into a small little quaint restaurant.  Because it's just a little simply family-run place, it's a little slower than normal, but so enjoyable.  Don't go hear if you are in a hurry.  This is an experience and one that provides a great place to relax and enjoy your company.

Regarding the food...I eat chicken parmesan all the time from all different kinds of restaurants.  The dish at Chelsea's is the absolute best in the city that I've had.  The chicken was cooked to perfection, the pasta that it sat on top of was great and the sauce was out of this world.

My wife had the sole and absolutely loved it.

Incredible night with my wife and we will continue to frequent this hidden gem in Sauga."}
{"text":"Very cute little restaurant. They essentially served us outside the regular hours. The owner is very attentive and affectionate. We had a chat about the traffic etc. Very nice experience. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is a little gem. The menu is extensive enough to cater for all but not excessive as all food is prepared in house and served by the owner I believe.
The atmosphere is great. We were a group of four and enjoying a pre Christmas night out. The beer, from the local Old Credit brewery, was chilled and the food was served perfectly and without any undue wait.
Access to the building is ramped but the washrooms are upstairs.
Decor is simple and light classical music plays softly. This restaurant is popular with local clientele, for the best reasons. Friendly, quality service."}
{"text":"You must go to this place if you are in Mississauga. The food is delicious and never disappoints. Great place to go for a date night."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so charming! It's essentially a restaurant inside a little house, giving a very warm, homey feel. 

We did the prix fixe, and went for the soup (soup of the day was potato & leek), daily grilled fish (rainbow trout), and creme caramel. All three dishes completely blew me away. The soup was incredibly creamy and flavorful, the fish was perfectly grilled, and creme caramel was absolutely delicious. 

The owner was very hospitable--he was very patient in explaining each of the dishes, and even asked if we wanted more bread with our first course. Definitely hope to return to this gem!"}
{"text":"This place is truly adorable!  The food was amazing.  The service was even better.

The owners are a very adorable couple.  I went with someone that frequents here quite a bit and speaks extremely highly of this place. 

We went on a day and time that was not busy and had the entire place to ourselves.  I was told that this was not normally the case as it's generally packed.  I actually liked having the place to ourselves!  

There is lots of free parking in the back of the house/restaurant.  

The restaurant seating area at the front was nicely decorated for the holidays with a beautiful tree. The owner made sure we had a table at the front where it was warmest.  The back area is also nice.  The tables were already set in a formal setting with nice clean white table cloths.  

We both picked to have the meal option which included a starter, entree and dessert.  You can tell that there was a lot of care put into each dish.  It was filled with great flavours.  The wife (chef) also came out to greet us.  

I highly recommend this place to anyone. It's not only a great first date place but wonderful for families and business meetings.  Very cozy.   I don't give 5 stars to everyone.  (nice to have 5* on my 100th review too!)  This one is truly a hidden gem!  I know why my friend continues to come back here."}
{"text":"A FANTASTIC DINNER and wonderful Hosts.  Thank you for a great evening"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. It is an actual home transformed into a restaurant. Food was fresh and tasty. Good size portions, and the service was very polite. Will definitely be back. The classic music playing was a nice touch."}
{"text":"This was a quite and small restuarant. My friend had his birthday here and it went great staff was so nice and everyone had a great time i would recomend this place to anyone that wanted to have a nice time in port credit."}
{"text":"A dated peculiar space belies the good to great meal you will be served at Chelsea. The owner is like a Monty Python character and that is a happy thing because I love to banter with him. Must try."}
{"text":"I wanted to go and love this place, but I guess it will have to wait until the next time I'm in Canada. 
We tried to go on Monday, but they were unexpectedly closed for renovations. 
We returned on Wednesday and didnt realize they don't do dinner on Wednesday.
We went back on Friday and arrived just as their hours said they opened for dinner... there was almost no one in the place and the host fumbled to say he couldn't serve us. Something about expecting to be too busy with big groups or something? He wouldn't seat us (only two people). He apologized but wasn't exactly the nicest about it, and it seemed as though he didn't much care about our business (obviously). 
We were disappointed... and a little taken aback."}
{"text":"We came here a couple of months ago and had the prime rib dinner Prix Fixe menus.  The food was excellent - every course was delicious and the pumpkin pie was so good my wife (who doesn't eat pumpkin pie) gobbled it right up!  Fantastic to support a family-run establishment!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.

I went to school in Port Credit then worked in the area for 10 years and never knew about this place. My girlfriend and I went for Valentines day after she found it online and what a special find it was.

The atmosphere is cozy, the owner/host is very friendly, and most importantly the food is home cooked perfection.

My only recommendation for this place is to advertise better. They are just off Lakeshore which is the highest traffic street in the area yet you can barely see this place from the road. I'd recommend a sign or two on Lakeshore Blvd.

Overall Food was 5/5 Decor 4/5 Staff 5/5

Will most definitely be back for a special occasion."}
