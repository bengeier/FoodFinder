{"text":"My mother and I went here for breakfast Saturday morning. We both got the bagel with smoked salmon. It was the biggest bagel I have ever seen in my entire life. It came with cream cheese, salmon,cut up tomato, onions , and capers. What I was REALLY impressed with , especially out here since you find so many breakfasts places put a lot of the attention on the  meat, but here with my giant bagel I got a massive serving of fruit! I was in breakfast heaven. Topped that with amazing service , our waitress made sure our coffee kept coming and food came in a few minutes it was definitely a wonderful surprise to eat there! HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. I had the sausage and arugula eggs bennie. It was great value and so delicious. My friends all loved their meals too. Our server was quick and friendly. Will definitely return when I visit Montreal next."}
{"text":"Première visite à cette succursale. Les ufs bénédictine était cuits comme demandés. Bonne quantité de fruits frais. Mon invitée à bien aimé son assiette de pain doré au sirop d'érable. Le service fut amical et professionnel. Stationnement facile en avant."}
