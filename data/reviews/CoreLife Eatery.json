{"text":"Great soup!  I have been here twice and ordered the Broccoli and Cheddar Broth Bowl.  It was delicious and quite reasonable calorie-wise.  The first time it was kinda thin and they were bringing out a fresh batch chuck loaded with vegetables.  So I asked them to give me some of the new batch - which they did.  The second time I asked them upfront to make sure it had enough vegetables and they did.  My only complaint is that they only give you a half piece of bread for the full portion of soup."}
{"text":"The best thing to ever come to Strongsville! My family and I visit CoreLife multiple times per week! I am on a strict diet and CoreLife has made my meal choices a cinch! The staff is super friendly and fast and the eatery is vey clean. I actually order 2 bowls every time I'm there so that I have meals for a few days! A definite must if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I had a very tasty lunch here.  Enjoyed a Mediterranean Bowl and it was definitely more than a one lunch portion!  Yummy options to mix and match.  Buy the fountain drink rather than a bottle so you can try different choices."}
{"text":"We have been a couple times. Every time we go the service goes down hill. Tonight's trip did me  In . It was like all employees smoked a huge joint and ate all the food before starting their shift. They were out of so many things. And major things , steak, kale , broccoli.  The dude who took my order kept forgetting what I said 2 seconds after he asked. He kept starting into space. My husband ordered a pre fix meal and when he went eat it he noticed 2 items were missing. The employees kinda make it awkward  Bc they argue with each other."}
{"text":"I visited this store the first day they opened. It took a little getting use to the menu but once I understood, I really liked it. The food was very fresh, very health and absolutely delicous! The only thing that I don't like is these \"industrial\" feel atmosphere. It feels very \"cold\" to me. Not very cozy. Everyone that worked there was very nice however and welcoming and I like to eat there as often as I can!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here (4) times already. Friendly staff, clean, nice portions, however I have one complaint. When the staff is transferring salad from the stainless bowl into your bowl, a lot of food comes out onto the cutting board ( which then is tossed). Sometimes it was my \"premium\" items that escaped such as avocado and chicken which was a bummer. Please be careful when filling the bowls that the good stuff gets in there please :)"}
{"text":"Ok... So I REALLY wanted to like this place. What's not to like? No GMOs, antibiotic free meat, BONE BROTH! I was so excited to fill my belly with one of the bone broth bowls, so I coerced my husband into stopping for dinner. Hubby had the chicken Cobb salad. It was good but nothing to write home about. I had the ginger beef bone broth bowl, and I was left incredibly disappointed. The only way I can describe it: it was a hot salad swimming in Sriracha water. The veggies are warmed, but not cooked. The broth had no flavor whatsoever. Seriously. If it wasn't for the splash of Sriracha, it wouldn't have tasted like anything. I added more Sriracha and about 10 grinds of salt from the salt grinder... And still nothing. I have made incredibly nourishing beautiful bone broth. It never tasted anything like this. This was just meat colored water. So sad. It could have been great. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 is that they have super fresh, clean ingredients. Just too bad they have no culinary intuition."}
{"text":"As a gluten free eater, I was excited to try the options at CoreLife. The food ordering style is like Chipotle, you can choose a green bowl, grain bowl, or broth bowl - and then customize; or you can choose from their favorite combinations.   As this was my first time and I was feeling a little overwhelmed, I choose an option from the pre-fixed \"grain bowl\" - Ginger Steak and Rice Noodles. I'm not sure what I expected them to do with that combination, but as I watched them add cold rice noodles to a healthy portion of uncooked kale, then sprinkle on some steak, shredded carrots, cucumber and ginger, I started to feel some dread. I kept thinking, \"they are going to cook it now, right?\" and then \"maybe I should ask for some broth?\". But when they added a tablespoon of dressing, I knew that I might have ordered the wrong thing. Well, maybe it would exceed my expectations and taste great? It did not. My cold rice noodle and kale salad was so bland, I had to go to counter and add salt, pepper and a good dose of siracha just to make it edible. And still all I could taste was kale. So maybe the \"grain bowl\" options aren't for me. If I go back, I'll try the broth.   The reason I gave CoreLife 3 stars, was the surprising revelation in the drinks department. After trying all of the options, I settled on the Coconut Water Fruit Punch - which was fantastic. Do you remember the punch made at school dances with sherbet and fruit juice and a fizzy drink? That is what this Fruit Punch tastes like. It made me so nostalgic, it was truly the best part of my experience at CoreLife.   So, to sum up, if you choose to go, make sure you like the taste of plain kale, otherwise, maybe try the broth, and don't forget to try the lemonade/tea offerings."}
{"text":"This is perfect for when you want a healthy meal, maybe like you'd make at home, but you don't have time or enough produce. The vegetables are extremely fresh & crisp. Great for vegan/ vegetarian/ gluten free/ etc. I only get the tofu so, I don't know anything about the meat. The dressings I've tried are flavorful. The cold brew coffee is good. The place is extremely clean."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The atmosphere was fantastic!  Very clean and inviting. They were very friendly and explained the different sizes.  I would try it again.   The only thing I would say- if you don't want a lot of dressing, ask for it on the side. My salad was drenched in Caesar dressing. My broccoli cauliflower soup was not very hot. Make sure to check the pricing as you are paying because they charged me almost 6 dollars more than they were supposed to. Good thing I caught it!"}
{"text":"Top notch, love the food. It's great to have a place to get a healthy meal in Strongsville."}
{"text":"I'd actually like to give this place more stars. It's tasty, somewhat fresh (found quite a few pieces of brown lettuce in our bowls) and a good for you option when out and about. Those are the positives. The negatives?! A kids build your own bowl ($4.95) ended up costing me $9.12!! For a kids small sized bowl!! WTH?! They charged $2.95 for 4 cubes of chicken and $1.25 for what looked like 1/2 a teaspoon of shredded cheese. Totally ridiculous. So, if you take your kids there...get them the regular sized already built bowls...it'll cost less and they'll get more. Very disappointed in the price gouging for a kids bowl."}
{"text":"The beef broth bowl was so oily that it was inedible.  Each soup spoon full was at least 85% oil and the vegetables and tofu were so oil covered that entire dish appeared to be shiny.  Rarely do we throw away food, but this $10 mess went straight into the garbage can.  It's really unfortunate because the concept of this restaurant is great and so is the atmosphere.  But yuck!  That meal was such a turn off that we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing! Try the Spicy Ginger Steak Broth Bowl - one of my favorites! I have to disagree with the previous review saying the Broth is plain and not salty enough. There is lots of flavor and quite a bit of salt (just look at the nutritional information).. It's bone broth, it's not Campbell's - it's meant to be healthier (Google about it). Besides the deliciously tender steak the kale is the best part! I literally stop in here 3-4 times a week and the kale has always been fresh and crisp. The salads are absolutely wonderful (I love bringing them into work when I want a night off from meal prepping) & the salad dressing is unique and very flavorful. This is probably not a place you want to go to if you are used to a highly processed unhealthy diet like McDonald's. Probably not a place children would appreciate if they are being raised on highly processed and unhealthy foods. I am so glad that Pittsburgh finally has a healthy, Paleo/Whole 30 friendly & very filling restaurant! Thank you CoreLife for coming to The 'Burgh. #HealthFood #BoneBroth #GameChanger"}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service there has been so so slow anytime I've gone. It's actually really interesting to watch and see just how slow they go. It gets super frustrating. With one person in front of me the other day it took me 12 minutes to order and pay and there were four people involved in the process. I blamed the newness when they opened but this should be figured out by now. Definitely go but make sure you have plenty of time."}
{"text":"The food was good and fresh. And the nutritional information is posted online for most things, and they have some good low calorie, high protein options. However, they're pretty new and I think still getting the hang of the recipes. I got a Spicy Chicken and Ancient Grains bowl to go, got home, and realized it didn't have any chicken in it. Disappointing since the high protein was the reason I'd ordered it. So do go here, but especially while they're still getting in the swing of things, pay attention when they're making your stuff and make sure they don't forget anything."}
{"text":"I'm watching carbs which aren't posted. They post calories. I asked and no problem. She went in the back and I was pleasantly surprised. They were very friendly. The Cobb salad was awesome and way to big for me - and it was a half portion."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  I really didn't want to try this place (sounded way too healthy).  Am I glad I did!  The Chicken Kale Cesar salad was very good!  The beet lemonade was also very good and really hit the spot.  Top notch ingredients really made for an enjoyable meal.  Perfect for the warmer months when you don't really want to eat heavier foods, but very satisfying.  Very nice atmosphere as well.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great experience. It's really nice to have a very healthy option, especially in that area of town. We have been waiting for a restaurant like this, with only a few competitors like Salad Meister. (also new, but on campus). I went with the medium southwestern bowl and it filled me up even better than I expected. All of the great food that you love, but zero regret.  Price wasn't bad either, as it is right on par with unhealthy options elsewhere. Now, we don't have an excuse... :-)"}
{"text":"Awful food: spicy chicken was too spicy, falafel was too dried, vegetables were soggy and over cooked. Grain mix was ok. Presentation of the food was bad. My husband and I barely ate half of our plates (mostly chicken, we paid for) and through leftovers away. For 2 plates: spicy chicken, power plate with antibiotic free chicken with veggies we paid $20."}
{"text":"The workers are always super helpful in explaining the menu and ordering process. The food is delicious, healthy, and always fresh. There are options for everyone, especially if you're looking for something vegan. The drinks are fantastic as well! The facility is kept clean and bright. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So my cousin is in town and doing whole30 while I just started weight watchers so we both keen to be healthy. So I came in with low expectations of this just being another salad place, but was happily surprised with all the options and the taste! The staff was friendly and really great about asking if the ingredients on the ginger steak noodle kale bowl I got was okay It really felt like they cared about people's food allergies as they asked everyone in line.   Giant plus they make there dressing fresh!!! I'm allergic to xantham gum which is in every salad dressing except oil and vinegar...needless to say it can get boring. None of their dressings have this horrible ingredient thus I will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I went here for a Yelp Elite Event, and it was so good, I just had to go back. It was kind of on my way home from work, so I stopped by there one Friday and picked up one of the grain bowls, the Southwest Chicken one. The staff is super friendly at this location and very helpful. I love how they let you make substitutions for free if you ask for something to not be included (like I cannot do jalapenos, so they asked if I wanted something else instead). The bowls also heat up very nicely if you take it home like I did and eat it later. I always feel so healthy, too, after eating here."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. I've never had an issue with ordering or taste. I ordered the southwest chicken bowl all 3 times; all 3 times I asked for no scallions. 2 of 3 times they asked me if i wanted to sub a different veggie in place of the scallion. 1 time they did not. That is the only inconsistency I've experienced. It's no big deal to me either. The staff is always extremely friendly, the food is delicious, and I love the lemonade bar.   It's a healthy restaurant and I don't feel guilty about what I eat here like I would at other places. The people who complain about blandness must want their food doused in salt and that is not healthy so I wouldn't have that expectation in the first place nor would I want it."}
{"text":"Ok I have come to CoreLife three days in a row now as I am in town for work. I have enjoyed everything that I have tried so far and can't wait to try other items on the menu. As a vegetarian it is always hard to find healthy places around town. Their items are completely customizable as well as they have gluten free options. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This may not be a representative review because I am definitely a one trick pony at core life. I cannot get past the spicy Thai noodle bowl. Yum"}
{"text":"This is a great concept.  If you're looking to get away from the typical fast food place for a better, gluten-free, and plant rich choice, come here. It is pricey (I'm not sure I want to calculate the profit margin on the iced teas and other beverages,) but I'm reminded of the statement \"don't ask why it costs more, but instead ask why the other places are so cheap.\"  I work to eat along a more paleo/primal template and this establishment is a no-brainer for eating along those guidelines.  I do frequently just stop in to get a bone broth for the road. Yes it's a Chipotle style service model, but compared to a Happy Meal (which only makes you unhappy a few minutes later) you're much better off coming here. I'm glad to find that one has just opened in another city where I sometimes work."}
{"text":"Love the healthy delicious food options fast! My daughter even loves the falafel!! Salads are amazing and I can't wait to try their bone broth options!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, fast and healthy  the tuna poke bowl is my fav but I've had a few others that are delicious as well. Thank goodness mentor has one more healthy option."}
{"text":"Once I found the right thing to order, I was hooked.  I've tried a few other things, as well. My favorite is the southwest chicken salad with balsamic dressing.  Their staff can be a little wishy washy and consistency can be an issue, so that's the only reason for the 4."}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful, don't feel drowsy after having lunch here. Would recommend the grain bowl with chili carrot dressing."}
{"text":"I first heard of CoreLife Eatery from a news article on Facebook. I was instantly excited to go out and try it, because it was so different from other food places. I was sad that the only one was in Strongsville. For my first time going I'd say it was worth the drive, otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way to get it.  The first time I went I made my own bowl. I wasn't 100% sure what I was doing. The first staff member I interacted with was not friendly at all. He seemed more annoyed with me that I was unsure than anything else. I did like how you could create your own bowl and that there are so many fresh options. It was a fun healthy way to build your meal. The thai cashew dressing was delish.   Overall, it was a bit pricy for me and the food was good. It was very clean inside and I liked the decor."}
{"text":"Good healthy options.  Staff is still trying to figure a few things out but overall We like it."}
{"text":"I knew the minute I ordered that I ordered the wrong thing. I mean, I never order steak unless it is Prime.  I ordered the Steak, Bacon and Bleu salad bowl. And I was underwhelmed. There was something missing in it. I had envy over what my friend ordered (something with chicken and Sriracha in it). And she swears their hummus is the best she has ever tasted. What impressed me was the number of fresh juice offerings. Again, I blew it by not getting one.  I did hit a home run by getting a quart of chicken broth to-go. That stuff is great. I will definitely go back and order what I would normally order which is something chicken-based and something spicy. Cool spot."}
{"text":"What a change of pace! Everything the serve is healthy. Fresh vegetables and meats.  I don't think there is one thing on the menu over 500 calories. They don't even serve soda. So if you are looking for a healthy light meal? This is the place. I will be back.   I ordered the Tuna Poke salad - it was delicious and filling. I could even finish it."}
{"text":"Wow, was very impressed as soon as I stepped in the door. Very clean atmosphere. The salad/bowl options are endless. I went with a prefix one, the southwest chicken and wild rice blend. It was one of the best salads I've ever had. All fresh ingredients and light but flavorful dressings. I also got a cup of broccoli cheddar soup which you could tell was homemade. The tea and juice bar is awesome as well. They also offer a few different done broths. So many different options that are very unique. The best part of this whole meal is it was 12 bucks and I left full. Well done corelife..."}
{"text":"Beautiful, fresh ingredients combined in delicious ways!  There are so many great choices that it was hard to decide.  Lots of vegetarian and gluten-free options.  Prices are very reasonable for the quality.  Nicely decorated, too.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, I've been to 2 locations now and can't wait for others to open!  They also let you tweak it a bit if needed!  Which I love because I am so picky. Awesome idea!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in for a salad and wow!  Got the Summer special and loved it. Went back again and got a hot rice bowl. Great quality meal for $9!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Spicy Ginger Steak & Rice Noodle broth bowl.  It was decent but lacking a lot of flavor imo.  I was expecting a bit more spice but the broth just tasted watery.  The restaurant itself is really nice and the juices they have are amazing.  I will probably come back and try something else.  Spicy Ginger Steak & Rice Noodle: 6/10"}
{"text":"First let me start by saying that fast food for me usually means either fries, chips or a big bun (subway).  I do like to eat healthy but it has to have some flavor. Beautiful place, nice Whole Foods crowd, only problem food good not very good.  It was very difficult to figure out the menu between the grain, greens or broth bowls.  I ordered the ginger steak with rice noodles.  They poured in all the veggies into a bowl, then the (very) rare steak.  I was getting excited until they poured the dressing on and served it uncooked!  Ok healthy. I get it, but raw scallions, cold noodles and almost uncooked meat???   Went with wife and sister who both like to eat healthy.  Both had different grain bowls, basically salads.  Both very skimpy, wife felt they must have missed an extra protein.  Of course no soft drinks to wash down the raw kale.   Will not be back (wife might give it another try). Next time chipotle."}
{"text":"Good layout and concept. I got the Southwest Grilled Chicken Bowl with some grains and it was good, but honestly it wasn't anything special... it was just a salad that I could probably get anywhere  else. I guess I was expecting something different. I'd still like to try other things though."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, someone greeting at the door, someone in line if I had questions or their recommendations. Quick, healthy and pretty looking food. I got the Sriracha ginger tofu, awesome & the beet lemonade, also very good. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Fresh food that tastes great. With two celiacs in our family, we were thrilled to find a place that offered a completely gluten free menu. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here 2 times. It's chipotle like. You pick what you want and add veggies and grains. I feel very health eating here. The other cool thing is the drinks. Lots of homemade weird teas and lemonades.   I'll definitely go back and try all other combinations. Good amount of healthy food and not expensive."}
{"text":"OK, so I went back and tried again.  Beef broth was weak again, but better than last time.  I am convinced that my first amazing taste of this broth was an anomaly- honestly, someone should add more salt to that broth.  It could taste pretty good.  BUT- those salads really are excellent.  I got the Poke bowl (the first time was brave enough to try poke) and it was delicious.  Like really good.  I'd come back here next time when I want to be healthy.  And order a salad or grain bowl."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the concept of this place. Like so many of other reviewers noted, it's got a variety of wonderful, healthy options that are sure to leave you feeling great and satisfied after eating there.  I tried the tuna poke bowl and my mom got the Asian chicken bowl with bone broth. All of the ingredients were fresh. They forgot to put the quinoa on my bowl, and it had a slightly funky taste, and my mom's broth was a bit bland. Overall, I would absolutely come back, but hope that the flavors are right on point next time.  The seasonal apple cider green tea was AMAZING."}
{"text":"Worst customer service.  Very unprofessional and petty staff members. Including the one manager. Been here twice since the opening and today will definitely be the last."}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of food here that will work work well for groups and that one friend who is a vegetarian or vegan. Prices are fair for fresh food made at the time of the order. I have been back a few times with my kids and every time everyone leaves happy with their food choices."}
{"text":"Walking into this place is visually pleasing and it radiates healthy! I got the spicy beef ginger noodle broth bowl that was the best I've had. Just the right amount, amazing flavors, not salty which I loved, and perfect amount of siracha to add that zing. I judge food by how it tastes and most importantly how I feel a couple hours after eating. I felt great! I also got the tomato basil bisque for my daughter. She told me it was the best soup she had. The creaminess comes not from heavy dairy but cauliflower! I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner and it's extremely affordable! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We were amazed by the wide array of healthy and fresh food choices.  Really cool to see them make it right there in front of you.  The staff was very good at what they do.  I told them it was our first time, and most places would give you a run down of how they work (what can you add, not add, etc) but this one didn't.  Love how they give you samples of their drinks to try.  Will definitely be getting one as a result when we are there next time.  A bit pricey, but with coupons, it was a good deal."}
{"text":"I have been in love with poke bowls since we got back from Hawaii last year. I have also had a hard time finding a good one anywhere around Pittsburgh. The Fire Poke Bowl at Corelife is amazing! I made some small changes to it, only did half the rice, added extra cabbage, carrots, edamame, and didn't use the fire sauce, and it was the best poke I have had outside of Kauai. Seriously!   The price was a little high, but there was enough food here to feed me 2 full meals, so I wasn't unhappy with that. I just wish that there was a Corelife closer to my house!"}
{"text":"This place fits in to the vein of fast casual. The people here are terrific. Even Though it is busy the line moves fast. The emphasis of the menu is healthy food. This is definitely a very nice addition to the Great Lakes Mall / Mentor Ave area"}
{"text":"This is a review on the lack of customer service and NOT the food. CoreLife is a 5 minute drive from my house and I have frequented the restaurant as well as brought other people and recommended it to others. I work full time and have evening obligations most weeknights so healthy takeout food is very valuable to me however tonight was the second time I've had issues with pick up. The first I chalked up to he restaurant being new...ordered a meal with steak and it had falafel; I let it go. Tonight is another story. I ordered a Mediterranean bowl with double protein, got it home to eat and noticed there was no falafel whatsoever. I called and asked about it and was told that they had no falafel, which would have been nice to know but I could have ordered something else. I asked for a partial refund as I was charged for double and got none and was hung up on. I called back and no one answered. Not a very happy customer. I'd be happy to update my rating if the customer service issue can be resolved."}
{"text":"Overpriced and tiny portions. If you are claiming to be a healthy place then people need more than a 1/3 cup of protein with their meal if they are only eating meat and veggies. Otherwise they will not be full. I got a double portion of the steak on my salad (which only comes with 2 toppings- others are extra) and it was barely enough protein. The steak was so chewy and gross that I could not even chew half of it. The other time I got a chicken salad. It tastes good but again I was hungry 2 hours later because of the portion. You are better off cooking at home healthy for much cheaper :/"}
{"text":"I am so glad this place opened! There was definitely a need for it and I feel a little disappointed if a week passed and I haven't been in. My favorite is the ginger steak rice noodle bowl (I would say the grain bowls overall are better than the salads) and the broth bowls are quite good too. The drink selections are also quite tasty and unusual--the cayenne pepper cranberry lemonade is a must-try. So glad to have this option in town!"}
{"text":"We were able to come before their big opening in Strongsville and we were thrilled!! Amazing service, amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Omg I wish there was one of these little gems by me. Fresh salad... hot bone broth by the sipping cup and the best beet lemonade I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh food and friendly service. Great selection especially for drinks. I will be going again."}
{"text":"I've been Jonesing for a good hot VEGAN soup and came across this wonderful place while visiting and shopping with the in laws. It was perfect! You select a grain, veggies and a broth of choice. I selected the shiitake mushroom and roasted tofu off the menu it has (vegetable broth, I added quinoa, shiitake mushrooms, napa cabbage, shredded kale, roasted tofu, sprouts, ginger, lemongrass, sliced almonds) I also added a little siracha and lemon and was good to go. It was fantastic I will definitely be back. Oh yeah and the beet lemonade was to die for."}
{"text":"CoreLife is by far my favorite place to get a nutritious meal! They have a wide range of options, but my favorite it the Mediterranean. Their food is so full of flavor and they give you such a large amount that you can save it for later. It's worth paying more for actually healthy food than being stuck going to Panera where food is advertised as healthy but is actually packed with sodium and carbohydrates. The staff is very friendly and one time when their scanner wasn't working they comped my meal because I had no other means of payment. A truly wonderful place to get a meal."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's nice having a restaurant that is quick and healthy to go to! Plus they have excellent customer service! Jenna at the cash register is so nice and helpful and always tells me the best thing to get!"}
{"text":"Really nice variety of healthy meals. I'm not sure anything here would be considered unhealthy! I had the spicy chicken and ancient grains (turns out this is just quiona) warm bowl. Way more spicy than I expected, so much so that I had to stop eating it. Dining partner had the chicken cobb salad. Said it was good and had no complaints. Moderately priced, the large bowl was around $9. Also got a drink, where you can choose from I think 8 lemonades and teas. The staff was not overly friendly or helpful, but they were very busy so can't fault them much for that. Overall a good experience. Lots of sitting room... A nice addition to Mentor."}
{"text":"Unique concept, the place has a great feel to it. It's OK to go once in a while however if you're really hungry it will not do for you."}
{"text":"Another case of liking the concept more than the food. But it's mostly just the inexperience of the staff. It's a new olace woth a very young staff who aren't familiar with all the wacky ingredients and techniques that they try to implement. So getting through the line takes a little time. But they use top notch ingredients and have a lot of super out of the box meals. And the staff is really nice and try really hard to make a good meal for you. I will continue to try new things and am excited to see this restaraunt mature.."}
{"text":"Core Life definitely has a few particular target customers. This fast-casual eatery offering salads and broth \"bowls\" caters primarily to those who are gluten free, vegetarian, health-conscious, or have dietary restrictions on sodium, sugar, or food additives.   Although I appriciated the concept, service, cleanliness, and atmosphere, I didn't quite enjoy my steak and ginger broth bowl. That is because I am simply not one of Core Life's target customers. I value bold flavors, spices, and proper salting of food over the simplicity and \"healthiness\" of the dish I was provided. The reason I took one star off is because I personally didn't enjoy my meal, and I left slightly hungry and underwhelmed. Althought the portions were big, the meals start at around $8+ and I felt that I could whip up the meal they served me by pouring broth over fresh veggies and meat at home at a reduced cost. To reiterate: there wasn't anything interesting, particularly tasty, or innovative to the dish I ate. It was very bland.   Even though Core Life isn't for me, if you are any one of the people mentioned above I urge you to give this place a try. My vegetarian friend that I came here with and a few other people in line couldn't stop raving about how there is finally a place for them to eat at, and how they've been there several times since its opening.   When it comes to tasty bone broth soups, I'll stick to Pho."}
{"text":"Great to finally have a healthy, reasonably priced option in Fairlawn/Bath. The food is good, great lemonade options."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and got two soups - broccoli cheddar with chicken and veggie tofu mushroom. Both had really fresh veggies and service was fast and friendly. My soup needed a little more flavor (salt, probably) but the broccoli cheddar was awesome and the grilled chicken was flavorful and juicy. Plan to come back and try other entrees."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend. I built my own bowl and it was fantastic - lots of flavor, good price, big portion. I also loved he juice options. My one complaint - the location. I just don't get it. It's so inconvenient for me. I just think it should closer to where all the action is - Cleveland. Tremont, Ohio city, Gordon park square.  They could use something like this."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  The food is so fresh and wonderful! My daughter and I go at least weekly.  The staff is extremely nice and helpful as well.  If you like healthy food, just go!"}
{"text":"So very happy to have something like this in the 'burbs. I tried it today (grand opening! Yay!) and it did not disappoint. This is a bowl concept...pick your base (noodles, grain, greens) then pick protein and toppings. Or pick one if the pre-conceived menu items. I didn't feel like making my own, so I selected Spicy Ginger Steak which came on kale and spinach, red and green peppers, and a chili vinegrette. Apparently this bowl only has 300 calories but it tasted too good to be so healthy. They also have no soda, just about 10 choices of fresh lemonades, teas, and juices. I had tropical green tea mixed with a little beet lemonade. Delish. Teas are unsweetened (yay!), so if you are looking for a sugar bomb, BYOB.  Everyone working seemed upbeat and happy despite the rush of people trying the place out. Service was also fast. Can't wait to come back and try more things. Please, others try this place, too. I want this to be here for a long, long time."}
{"text":"This is our Go-To restaurant when we want fresh and healthy! You can order from menu or customize your own bowl. Everything is fresh. I love the bone broth bowls, especially the spicy ginger steak. I love that the veggies are quickly steamed and not over cooked. The cayenne lemonade is a special treat! I like to mix the lemonades. If I were to open a franchise, it would be a CoreLife!"}
{"text":"The steak bacon and bleu cheese greens bowl is one of the best salads I've had. Especially for the price. The lemonades are also incredible and creative. I was at first intimidated by raspberry cayenne and cucumber basil lemonades, but they have little cups to taste test before you pour a whole glass and they're sooooo good. Definitely try them if you visit!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's not like I didn't enjoy my food per say.  I ordered a spicy thai \"green\" bowl. I would say I have a medium tolerance for spice, and this wasn't the least bit spicy. I appreciated the healthy options, but it was just sort of chaotic in there and I didn't really enjoy my food. On top of that, I was hungry two hours later, so it wasn't very satisfying. That being said, it's not like there are a lot of other options at The Block Northway so....you may not have much of a choice. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Really good and fresh food. Definitely a lot of different varieties of meat and veggie friendly options for people."}
{"text":"I want to like I really do!  This is my second visit.  The concept is great.  The first visit I got the spicy ginger steak green bowl. It tasted ok but skimpy @ 8.95 for a half a bowl of kale and a few pieces of steak it seemed a bit much. So this time I \"created my own\" with a few extra ingredients.  By just looking at it, it was almost twice as big.  But this time the grass fed steak was too tough to eat.  I don't know if I'll give it a third try or not.    Update:  Ok, I have it a third try (my daughter is vegan and loves it).  This time I got the chicken Cobb green bowl dressing on the side.  Better than the first two experiences! I'm over the drinks tho."}
{"text":"When I crave a good salad, I go here. The vegetables are always fresh. The staff is friendly, yet a little slow sometimes in the evening."}
{"text":"Healthy. Filling. Choices are almost endless. Fresh made juices, broths, soups, salad, bowls. Kinda set up like a chipotle... easy in and out."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthier option when I want to get a bite to eat while I'm out shopping. The restaurant is a Panera/Chipotle-type place, where they have a menu and offer customization of it all. Each time I've been here, I've gotten the Spicy Thai Chicken Grain Bowl and it is delicious. (I'll admit- my first time here I dined in and it wasn't great, but the other times have been takeout. Maybe there's something about the veggies sitting in the dressing for a little bit when getting takeout that makes it so tasty!)  The lemonade options are great! The cranberry cayenne is my favorite. It has an unexpected kick that is so yummy and not overwhelming if you don't care for spice.  CoreLife is a nice change from the other fast food restaurants available on McKnight and I'm glad it's an option!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! Fresh, fast, and very reasonably priced. Such a great concept and I'm glad there's something like this here in town. Think of a cross between Chipotle and Panera bread... Only better! Healthy food that's absolutely delicious. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have more healthy food options so close to my home. This place is so good and easy to get in and out of if you are on the go. Prices are very affordable and the food is very fresh."}
{"text":"Amazing! Excellent healthy food choices, great interior and wonderful service! Perfect location in Strongsville."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but the food was SO bland! I've never had \"soup\" with such a lack of flavor. On top of that, the employees seemed confused (the same girl kept trying to give me someone else's food), and the ordering process is weird. No one seemed to know what each menu item actually was supposed to come with.  I get that they're new, and everyone working was really nice to us, but the food was just so terrible that I don't think I'll ever go back to try it again."}
{"text":"Finally got what  I expected a new business to strongsville to give! A warm welcome and smiles from the entire staff! I went there with  my mom this afternoon. Employees were great and happy. That is huge to me  on another note it was very clean and fresh! We both got the chicken broth bowl to go and it was delicious and healthy. I also love that their drinks are not sweetend. I had a beat lemonade mixed with a coconut fruit punch (suggested by an employee walking by) and I loved it! I will be back and can't wait to try more food and drink!"}
{"text":"Please come here and eat, the food is amazing.  I may not be the most healiest guy, but this place will now be a go to place. The staff and especially the manager took time to go over everything on the menu and try multiple things. If you are in the area do yourself a favor and come in and try this place.   You're welcome in advance."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. It's nice to finally have a healthy option with great customer service."}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable! I usually order it online, but I like going inside to order whenever possible, I get the spicy Thai chicken and rice noodle bowl, and I like it with extra noodles but there isn't an option for that online. But when I go in to order it with extra noodles, they don't have a problem with extra and I don't even get charged for it, which is cool (hopefully nobody gets in trouble, lol!) aside from the food, the place is always clean and I always see someone cleaning tables whenever I'm there. The drinks are pretty awesome from the fountain, and they have a huge variety of beverages! This place is a little more expensive then say Chipotle, probably about $5 more, but it's so worth it. One thing I love about the food, I never feel stuffed or bloated after eating here. The food isn't heavy at all, and like I said, I get extra noodles (:"}
{"text":"Food is healthy fresh and good. Love the homemade salad dressings and different drink options. Only improvement I can think of is to change the whacked out music they blast while you are eating."}
{"text":"Everything was super fresh and that was the only good thing. We went here expecting an awesome healthy light lunch and we were so disappointed. Everything had so little flavor and the broth was greasy. Keeping it healthy doesn't  mean you have to skip on the flavor. There is a world of spices you can explore without adding any salt. Needless to say, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Had the spicy chicken and ancient grain bowl with sriracha and the jalapeños cilantro lime vinaigrette dressing. Took the big bowl approx $9:15. The salad was fresh. The serving was filling. The chicken had nice flavor and the sriracha added the kick. There are other options including a broth and salad options. Feeling refreshed."}
{"text":"The food is really good. The service is decent. But I don't know how a restaurant operates without food and no one answers the phone. I've tried for weeks. They finally fixed the ap but both online orders I picked up looked like someone just threw everything into a pile without giving two shits and with missing ingredients. I get that it's fairly new but for the price I'd expect a better response to demand. I'm sitting in the parking lot writing this because I had to leave. They had no steak, no chicken, no falafel, no chicken broth and who knows what else was left off that lists posted on the walls because they've been out of certain foods for weeks. Get it together people."}
{"text":"Service was good but food is so-so. Everything lacks flavor. The coconut curry bowl is just watered down curry. The broccoli in it were half raw. The shiitake mushroom and roasted tofu broth bowl is also bland. The tofu looks and tastes more like boiled rather than roasted. I would not recommend getting anything other than a salad here."}
{"text":"very good food and fresh ingredients, sometimes staff is not the friendliest though. i love the broccoli cheddar soup, it's definitely unique compared to the typical broccoli cheddar soup."}
{"text":"I really like this spot - I pick up food here on my way to the airport so that I have something healthy to eat on the plane. It's healthy and quite cheap! I get a heaping salad for under $8, filled with veggies, tofu, avocado. You can pick and choose the ingredients that go into your bowl, salad, plate, or broth bowl. I definitely recommend it for a quick healthy bite."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for a vegetarian. Everything is healthy and the friendly service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Delicious restaurant!!! My husband and I eat here several times a month!!! Their salads are my favorite and the variety is incredible, without the guilt!!! I highly recommend corelife!!!"}
{"text":"Glad we decided to try this place! We arrived right at 11 for an early lunch and decided to share two bowls. One grain one with noodles. Both had great spice were fresh, and tasty!  I only had water, but I've since heard that the tea / lemonade bar is a must!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place three stars only because the location is gorgeous, well maintained, has great variety of menu options, staff is nice, and often food tastes good, however.......i leave hungry. The portion I got from my $9 salad was so weak that I am going to have to go get another meal elsewhere afterward. That's a big bummer!! And no I'm not a heavy eater who never has salads. I eat salads for lunch every day from souper market or tastebuds and they are hefty yet healthy portions for the same price and I am full following.  When I got to the check out I had to literally pause when she said the $9 because I was like there simply is no way that was considered a \"big bowl\" they must have accidentally given me the small bowl. Nope. I pulled it out of the bag and stared at it and said really? She said is something wrong with it? I said this is the big bowl? It seems a little small. She awkwardly smiled and said yes. I said wow okay, just seems really small. Silence.....I turned around and walked away staring in awe and sadness that I spent $9 and knew I was going to have to go elsewhere for more. I'll probably stick with other healthy option locations in the Cleveland area due to value for the money, but this place is still super cool concept and maybe other options are more filling like broth or grain bowls??   Sincerely,  Bummed and still hungry"}
{"text":"Great clean fresh food. We have eaten here several times. Line can get backed up, hence lukewarm food- but all in all a decent experience.  Four stars because it is rather pricey..."}
{"text":"I'm newly vegan this year and try to do mostly whole food plant based and there aren't not many options at all in the strongsville area as far as eating out. I was beyond ecstatic to hear of CoreLife Eatery opening and couldn't wait to try it! Love the vegan options and that they clearly label the dressings to tell you what is vegan or vegetarian. I built my own bowl with kale, the rice blend, cherry tomato, red cabbage, green onion, chickpeas, tofu and the Thai cashew dressing! It was so delicious and filling! The portions are great! I cannot wait to keep going back to try different dressings and combinations!"}
{"text":"WOW!  This is my new favorite place EVER! Everything is so fresh and so yummy!  I had a chicken tortilla broth bowl with beef bone broth. Everything is made fresh everyday, including the bone broth. The service is super friendly and very quick and helpful. I'm going to go back and try each and every  dish!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! Healthy eats in Ohio?! I'm sold. Their menu includes salads, grain bowls, soups with bone broth, and rice bowls. You can also make your own. I loved how everything is gf and gmo free.   They have different veg bases, including kale, lettuce, and spinach. Their meats include tofu, ahi tuna, chicken, steak, and spicy beef. Lots of different dressings to choose from. Other bases include rice noodles and purple forbidden rice.  I got the ahi tuna bowl with quinoa and although nothing will beat the poke I had in Hawaii, the bowl tasted very good. Beautiful presentation and able to customize. They are also environmentally friendly with recycling and real silverware if you are dining in. Would  return next time I'm in the area and will look out for other Core Life Eateries around!"}
{"text":"Very good, fresh food overall. Especially for health conscious crowd! Just a bit too light on flavor for me....."}
{"text":"What an awesome and wholesome addition to the North Hills. Along with First Watch and Hello Bistro, this is an awesome new addition to the healthy meal options in the area. Corelife focuses on three types of bowls---grains, greens and broth bowls. You can customize your grains, greens or broth with whatever ingredients you like from their extensive options or choose from pre-determined recipes on the menu. I've only tried green bowls so far which as you could imagine, are salad based. I had the Caesar and Cobb green bowls. You can choose from small or large. Large is good if that will be your entire meal. It is a great portion. Small is more for a lighter appetite or if you'd like to also pair it with another menu item. They also have a great assortment of lemonades. I HIGHLY recommend the basil cucumber lemonade. It is so delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Whether you want soup, salad, protein bowl or a pho bowl this is your place! The salads are fresh and you can build your own. The tomato bisque was even more amazing and I'm a tomato bisque connoisseur. Highly recommend! Very close to great shops and a cool nail salon!"}
{"text":"OMG DELICIOUS!!! We came here today and had dinner, and wow were we impressed! I got the Tuna Poke Grains Bowl and fell in love. Kale, Napa cabbage, Tuna, carrots, avocado, edamame, quinoa... who could want more?!?! Service was fast and friendly, decor was open, bright, and relaxing, menu is full of healthy vegan and gluten free eats!! The quality in the ingredients shows here, my tuna poke was so fresh and tasty...didn't taste frozen or old. Husband got the ranch steak bowl and said the purple rice that came with it was awesome as was the steak and corn.  $27 for 2 bowls, a juice and a bottles water, not too bad! We will definitely be back to this place!"}
{"text":"Newly gluten free this place is perfect!  The whole menu is gluten free! It's yummy and healthy!  Please put one of these in Macedonia! :)"}
{"text":"I'm only giving it 3 stars because it's a new place and clearly they are still working out the kinks. I also love the menu! The customer service is very lack luster at best. No one smiled, everyone seemed irritated, the cashier didn't know how to use the register, they had no small bags of lids for a small soup. There also seemed to be a guy Steve that was in charge, he seemed more interested in blending in than actually leading or helping people unless they called him over. Hopefully they can train their staff to be friendly and knowledgeable. If I'm going to pay $8.00 for a small salad, you can at least be pleasant."}
{"text":"- tuna poke was amazing. Got it as-is and they nailed it. Dressing has great flavor and all the ingredients were fresh! Also got a side of their roasted veggies (eyes were bigger than my stomach) and they had great flavor too. They do have a little black pepper in them for the pepper lovers!"}
{"text":"I've been reading the news about this place, but I'm always a little skeptical when there's a lot of hype so I waited until they'd been open a week or two and then went on a night when I didn't think they'd be busy. I was wrong! There was a line for orders, but it still didn't take long to make it to the front. And it gave me time to review all my choices and there were many! I ordered the Thai Spicy Chicken and Rice Noodles. Yum! Yum! Good choice!"}
{"text":"We went to the VIP event Wednesday. It was busy but that was to be expected so we were okay with waiting. They had multiple staff members around hanging out to help explain the menu and how to order. They seemed knowledgable. My husband tried the spicy steak bone broth bowl. It was very tasty, good amount of heat with the Sriracha. Everything seemed fresh. His only complaint was being a steak bowl there wasn't much steak in the bowl. Tasted good but not much protein.   I went with a grain bowl. Got the rice noodles with the Thai Chicken. Again very good and fresh however very small amount of protein for it being listed as a chicken bowl. Maybe 2 oz.. which for a bowl named that seems like you should get just a bit more... got the dressing they suggest just needed a tad more. Next time ill go for a vegetarian broth based option with tofu. Also we tried some of the tea and lemonade. Very good but if you like sugar you'll need to add your own... overall the place was lovely. We would go back. Staff was friendly and helpful, food was fresh and healthy.  I would definitely suggest this place if your looking to eat a clean and healthy meal."}
{"text":"This place just opened... and it's sweet!  I had the Steak & Ginger Broth soup... it was OK.  You can buy a drink for $3.60 and try all of the fresh flavors & iced coffee. Unlimited.   My soup wasn't the best ever, it lacked flavor.  The rice noodles and veggies were fine. I would like to try a salad next time.   The juices are not \"premium\" squeezes, but they are mixed with lemonades and such. Still refreshing.   The bathrooms clean & music  makes a cool experience."}
{"text":"I love the options and variety of salads   Their hours are not very good though   The veggie broth is so good"}
{"text":"Very disappointing! After reading all the great reviews and hearing all the hype about this place, I finally stopped in for lunch. I got the Grilled Chicken Tortilla Bone Broth to go. It is nothing more than very weak chicken broth with chicken , black beans, kale and jalapenos thrown in. The jalapenos were the only ingredient with any taste. Otherwise very bland. Not exactly inexpensive either. Small bowl is $8.45."}
{"text":"I was super excited to go here, but the hype does NOT match the vibe in the resturant. I know it's new however TRAIN your employees, chipotle line workers would run circles around them twice. The cashier was completely rude and seemed like she didn't want to be there. It was also pretty dead... why are ALL THE TABLES DIRTY.  And to top it all off being as dead as they were, there were barely any ingredients on the line, and the steak was chewy.  Another failing chipotle/Piada concept."}
{"text":"We have anxiously been awaiting the opening of CoreLife Eatery in Mentor. We were able to get there on a Monday for lunch and though there was a line almost to the door, which is probably about a dozen people in front of us, the line moved quickly. They seem to be well staffed and knowledgeable. I was uncertain on how or what to order and there were some set meals, so I chose the easy route and ordered the Kale Chicken Caesar salad. My daughter made her own salad which enabled her to get 4 toppings of her choice. It would be helpful if there were more detailed instructions on how or what could be ordered individually for a novice like myself. However, now that I have been there, I understand it a little better and will take my time next time in deciding exactly what I'd like to try. Even though the parking lot was packed, there was plenty of seating and I noticed the ability to order ahead, which I am sure will be convenient. The food itself was outstanding, the basil cucumber dressing was incredible and sure to be one of my favorites. It is so nice to have a solid lunch option and and easy option to pick dinner up as well."}
{"text":"As some of the others said on here, I've never had a more bland tasting bowl of soup. I ordered the steak broth bowl, and the entire dish was the most bland and tasteless bowl of soup I've ever had. I don't think I'll ever go back. I ended up eating a few spoonfuls before tossing it. Cool concept, and the employees were really nice. Hope they take the feedback and revamp the entire menu."}
{"text":"It really makes me happy to live in an area that is expanding with franchises that are not that common just yet. I am all about healthy eating, whole foods, fresh foods because I really do believe when you eat better, you feel better. The set-up is like chipotle/hello bistro where you have the option of building your own bowl. They also have the calories of each bowl listed on the menu, so if you are watching your weight the numbers are right in front of you.   I stopped here on Saturday after I left my Barre class and decided to go with a pre-made grain bowl (thai chicken & rice noodles). You can either get a small or a large bowl; I ended up getting the small and thought it was plenty! The bowl comes with chicken, rice noodles, napa cabbage, sliced almonds, broccoli, cucumbers, cilantro and thai cashew dressing. I was very satisfied with the freshness of the bowl and how quickly it was assembled. *Note - do not expect a hot bowl, because these are served cold. I definitely want to build my own bowl next time, but I will have to decide on my selections before hand. I also had a very tasty raspberry tea from their handcrafted drinks line up; highly recommend trying these out.     Overall, the pricing is on point, the facility is fresh and modern and most importantly the food is wholesome."}
{"text":"First time I enjoyed the spiced chicken purple rice and falafel bowl although falafel is not good. Love the cayanne lemonade. Second time was very disappointed. Ordered the same thing but service was poor. Employee left and ended her shift in the middle of my order. I was left waiting for fresh hot falafel b/c the others look old and dry. The worse part was that I had to tell the next employee how to finish my bowl since the first employee walked away. I was missing broth and falafel. Worst part is. after waiting the fresh falafel looked like dog food and tasted terrible. Maybe I should try something else but I'm not likely to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is great!  And it checks off all of my boxes!  Delicious  Affordable  Healthy  Clean   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and really enjoyed my meal both times. Their different lemonade are delicious, so I definitely recommend those. I did not find the ordering process to be confusing at all, and the employees have always been friendly the times I have gone.  I can definitely see how some people may not be full after their meal. I think you just have to be self-aware of how much you actually need to feel full, especially if you're doing with a salad. I had a large greens bowl both times with the normal amount of protein, and I felt full afterwards. I do think the price you pay for the amount of protein you get could be lower. I got the tuna poke once and definitely would have appreciated a bit more for the money.  tl;dr: good healthy food option, maybe a bit pricier than what some would hope for, be aware of your own needs to feel full. check it out!"}
{"text":"So I wanted to like this place after doing research. I hate all the extra ingredients and lack of freshness involved in most fast service restaurants. I ended up with an experience that will guarantee I never go back. I have a major problem with pictures of food that end up looking nothing like what is served. The picture showed many slices of med rare steak and I was served four pieces of what looked and tasted like jerky. They also gave me the wrong dressing and seasonal veg instead of the brussel sprouts I asked for. It was also $11 for that plate of food. Not acceptable at all in my opinion, and I will never be back. I'm not saying it isn't great for some, but I can't imagine that steak is ever cooked correctly or a served as a larger portion."}
{"text":"My 7 year old : wants to give this place 20 stars. The food is the best food I've ever had. Especially the barbeque chicken. And the chicken broth and rice were great."}
{"text":"First couple times I ate here I did not quite like the food. The third time I got something different, and now I'm hooked! I absolutely love this place and find myself craving it almost every day. Everything is fresh and made right in front of you. The drinks are definitely different - but delicious. The staff are extremely polite, helpful and courteous. Definitely one of my favorite spots in town!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! Was hoping to find something new in the north hillls, but this was not the place!!!  Ordered the chicken and rice noodle broth bowl and my husband had the steak salad!  The broth bowl was very bland!!! the vegetables are steamed first and then they add about 5 pieces of chicken and finish with Luke warm broth.   It ends up not blending the ingredients together and the vegetables are very hard!!!  Absolutely no flavor and very expensive too!!  The salad had more flavor but very little portion for an 11.00 dollar salad!!!  Then they give you what the girl said was a free piece of bread!! Again we were reminded it was free but it was not even a whole Slice it was a half a slice of bread!!!  Very disappointed would not be willing to spend that much money again!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. Taking a page out of the Chipotle book, CoreLife provides its patrons with a selection of greens or grains, a protein, and additional options.   I've visited CoreLife on three occasions, opting for a salad twice, and a broth bowl once. The bone broth is a never again for me. Absolutely zero flavor. None. The salads on the other hand are very fresh, and very good if salad is your particular cup of tea. In fairness, it's not mine. But it is what is says it is, and that's good enough for me. $9 for a salad though, puts CoreLife way down on my list of favorite spots. But if salad is what you're after, and you have $9 to spare, you can't go wing with CoreLife."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Good portions.  I had the ranch Flank Steak.  It was so good and I loved the purple rice.  Very filling.  I got two meals out of it."}
{"text":"The healthiest and freshest restaurant in Pittsburgh. Don't expect lots of carbs and processed food when you come here. A truly health oriented and gluten free friendly restaurant. Everything I tried is amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm trying to give it a try still ... Service is a wee slow but my first time there my food was not great. I did ask for what I wanted but I was not told how it came....  Soup wise for warm stuff was nice, I love it and really loved the lemonades drinks.  My husband like it am still on the fence."}
{"text":"Amazing healthy option - all entrees are gluten free! Delicious flavors. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times since this opened in the fall. I was very excited to see Strongsville get something that is healthy and trendy (my kind of restaurant). I love how healthy and fresh everything is here. They have grain bowls, salad bowls, bone broth bowls to choose from. You can do a bowl from their menu of options or make your own. I usually do a make your own bowl, but I have had the thai chicken and rice noodle bowl, broccoli cheddar and tomato and basil bowls (all very good!). The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is because of their lack of low-calorie salad dressing options and only being able to choose 4 toppings for your salad bowl. If I am trying to eat healthy I do not want a salad dressing with 100+ calories in it so I wish this was changed. Other than that I have no complaints and will still keep coming here."}
{"text":"Great place for healthy, tasty quick food.  I really enjoy the Cranberry Cayenne Lemonade.  I've enjoied broth, green and grain bowls.  I really like the Chicken Tortilla Broth bowl (I had it twice in three days)."}
{"text":"The first time we ate here we thought it was terrific. It's been going downhill since. Sometimes you pay for extra meat and get barely a piece or two. Today the chicken was mall Chinese restaurant quality. I think we'll wait a few months and try again if they are still around."}
{"text":"I love this place!! So many healthy options!! The kale Caesar salad is amazing. Great for substitutions! Please please open one at Case Western, you would do so much business there!!!"}
{"text":"This is great food and great staff. The food is high quality, made well, and tastes really good. Loved it. I want this to be the new McDonald's."}
{"text":"Today was my first time going to Corelife. I read some reviews before I went so I could get a better understanding of what people like and dislike. After reading one review about the salad leaving her hungry, I opted for a spicy chicken grain bowl but subbed tofu instead. When I got to work, I was shocked to find how little food the bowl contained. It was mostly greens, a few pieces of tofu, and I couldn't find too many ancient grains in there! After eating through some of the greens and tofu, I found a decent amount of grains hidden in the middle and I was a little relieved. I was cautiously eating, hoping that I would be full by the time I got to the bottom. I even took a few pauses to drink some water, in part because I wanted to be full, and also because the Sriracha was spicy. As I came closer to the bottom, I was able to let out a sigh of relief. I was comfortably full before I finished the last of the greens.  Overall, the food was okay. It was my first time eating tofu, as I am a partially committed vegetarian. I'm glad I was able to have a few bites of it before investing in a tofu block from the grocery store.  I feel that the portion wasn't worth over $9. If the portion size was larger, or the price was a little less, I would come back often. I didn't eat my food there, however, I didn't really care for the interior design. It has a Chipotle kind of feel, and I wasn't relaxed. I don't want to be completely captious of Corelife, they do have some great things. It is really hard to find healthy options for lunch on this side of town. Corelife is all about clean eating and providing good food to nourish the body. They have a menu that you can build upon or you can create your own bowl. I also commend Corelife because they make their own dressings from scratch."}
{"text":"This review is based on my first visit, but I certainly feel I need to try it again under other circumstances.   By the time my lunch hour arrives, I am usually famished.  The name of this place caught my attention and decided to try it out.  I was impressed with the large outdoor patio leading into the entrance. The interior is clean, colorful,and offers comfortable seating.  Ordering process can be easy, once you finally figure out what you want. I know the goal is to simplify the menu, and ordering process, but  because there are too many options the opposite occurred.   Salads rule here, toppings are in abundance, and the 14 freshly made dressings are as unique as they come.  Since I was expecting to see hearty and healthy soups, sandwiches and other entrees listed on the menu, I wasn't prepared for the brunt of the menu options to be salads and broths. The salad I ordered was freshly prepared and tasted great,  but did little to satisfy my hunger for the price paid.  I was thankful they included a complimentary piece of bread with my salad.  Corelife Eatery caught my attention, but I need to review and study the menu a little better to make sure I return from my lunch hour feeling like I ate lunch!"}
{"text":"Yummy place right off the interstate that allowed me to honor my whole-foods diet. The menu is overwhelming and confusing. The staff was nice and helped me through it though. The service is fast and the food was good.   The vibe of the place is a more-hipster Chipotle."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today and I was impressed with the friendly service (and patience) We're gluten free and have other allergy restrictions so I wanted to really study the menu to make sure everything we ordered fit our diets. I didn't feel rushed at all. Subbing items was no issue at either. When my toddler insisted she didn't want a salad and asked for an egg and avocado they just included the egg with my order when I asked if I could pay for one separately. I was able to sub a different dressing too. It's nice to know that a restaurant is safe for our family to eat at as well as understanding and friendly. Thanks !"}
{"text":"Called to order 4 things from the menu, they said they didn't take phone orders, I had to place my order online. Since I was at a baseball field, this was not happening. Would have liked to try this place but the customer service ( or lack thereof) was a turnoff."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. Not too crowded this time. I had the Steak, bacon and blue cheese bowl. Great flavors but the steak was too tough. My wife ordered a steak plate and didn't finish steak as she got tired of chewing.  Will try again someday"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews on Yelp, however, I thought that the exceptional service and quality food is deserving of this review. Before I delve into the quality of food I must mention the incredible service from my server Clara. She was extremely polite, put meticulous care into my dish while preparing it speedily, and had a smile on her face the entire time! The dish itself, made elegantly in front of me by Clara, was the coconut curry chicken and it tasted delicious. For many healthy dishes nowadays getting a bad rep for a trade off of flavor for health, this dish destroyed the healthy meal stereotype. Because of the combination of exceptional service and great dining this restaurant is receiving/deserves the 5 start review. Will be back for more! And I hope in the future I get servers as great as Clara!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I always eat vegetarian, mostly try to eat vegan. So I eat salads a lot, usually at restaurants with no veg options as a go to- and I get sick of eating salad. I went here to eat with my sister and was less than excited to eat something healthy. But oh my gosh. This was THE BEST salad I've ever had. It was so good it didn't even taste like a salad. I got the vegan salad with the carrot dressing. I got it as is, didn't substitute anything. I almost wanted to get a second one it was so good! This place is inexpensive, fast, clean, nice employees, and healthy. I didn't love the drink selection, I'm not really into sweet drinks (unless they contain alcohol). I honestly really wanted a pop but I get their point. overall I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Generally healthy menu reasonably priced as we went for lunch today.  Couple pointers to help avoid the one-visit-to-new-restaurant loss of patrons: Most disappointing was they did not have the brussels sprouts vegetable medley that is shown all over the menu pics.  Instead was offered a sweet potato dish.  Said the other was seasonal?! Busy place with tables open but nobody cleaning them off for next patrons.  Bathrooms single use only, must wait in line."}
{"text":"Fresh & Healthy!  There is a wide selection of dishes, from pre made salads, homemade bone broths, and \"Create your own\". When making your own, you choose between greens or grains. The greens include spinach, kale, romaine, and a few other lettuce options. The greens include quinoa and brown rice. With this, there is a variety of proteins and toppings.   I got a \"create your own\" romaine lettuce bowl with black beans, black olives, broccoli & avocado. What I liked about getting avocado is they peel it out the shell and slice it in front of you, it's as fresh as it gets!  With all this great food, there are many healthy drinks to choose from. My favorite being honey ginger lemonade, which they also claimed is a great detox!  I was very pleased with my visit here. I have been looking for more healthy places around me, because I typically would have to drive 30-40 minutes just to get a good vegan dish, or even just a salad. This place tops Chipotle on the healthy scale. Love it here!!!"}
{"text":"Nice to have a place to go in Champaign that offers healthy food in decently sized portions. You can either choose their dishes or customize your own. I got the double poke bowl and it was very good without any modifications to the ingredients. A bit pricey for what you get but the ingredients do taste fresh and come with good variability. Very unique drinks with free refills as well."}
{"text":"This place is so good! All kinds of healthy choices from ancient grain bowls to bone broth! I had the spicy chicken ancient grains bowl. It is so good! Full of flavor with Sriracha , Thai Chili Sauce, and a Jalapeno Lime Vinaigrette. Along with the chicken and quinoa, there was kale, carrots, broccoli and beets. You can get bread and butter for free which is nice. And they have a great selection of homemade teas and lemonades. I wish this wasn't so far from me!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken plate with roasted sweet potatoes and the grain based salad. The best part was the grain based salad it was flavorful and had some fresh elements. The roasted sweet potatoes were terrible, the come with the skin on and are more savory...it left a bad taste in the back of my throat."}
{"text":"I want to give this a 3.5 but decided to round up. This was healthy, fresh food- core, if you will... but they lacked variety. Fortunately for you lemonade lovers, what they lacked in options for food, they made up for in drink options. Basically, you can choose from soup, salad or rice bowls. They dress it up so fancy, that I expected so much more. *shrug* I tried something called a power plate- both my date and I did. You build your own meal with a choice of protein, vegetable and choose from a selection of bases. I tried the falafel and hummus base with roasted sweet potatoes and quinoa. It was pretty tasty- definitely not filling, however. I've never had green falafel but it was baked, so score for healthy as promised. My date had chicken with the salad greens, roasted root veggies and sweet potatoes. He said the chicken was super moist and the dressing was great. We paid about $20 for a lunch for two and still wound up buying popcorn at the movies due to hunger. So in summary: upside is that it is healthy and tasty. Downside, portions are smaller (which contributes to the healthy) but on the pricier side. The restaurant was bright, spacious and clean, so that's an enormous plus. Location across from weekend errand shopping and the movies can't hurt business, either."}
{"text":"This isn't the normal type of place we would pick to eat, but the reviews were good and we wanted to give it a try.  We were pleasantly surprised !!  I ordered the spicy ginger steak & rice noodle broth bowl. It was really good. The broth was a bit bland, but I added a little siracha and some salt to help  My husband had the southwest grilled chicken and wild rice grain bowl. He said it was very good and very fresh. His only complaint was that there was some kind of grain in it that was undercooked or raw.   They have many choices of fresh lemonade and tea here. My husband had the best lemonade, which sounded awful to me, but was actually quite good. I had the raspberry ice tea.   All in all, we were glad we tried it and may come back.   It is pricey - cost $25 for two bowls and two drinks. I'm sure you are paying for the \"fresh\" concept   If you are looking for a meal that is heavy and makes you feel over filled and needing to unbutton your pants, then this isn't your place. However, it's a perfect place for a healthy meal."}
{"text":"Always good food. I've been trying to experience a different thing each time I go in there. The advantage is it's always fresh. Sometimes warm entrees aren't very warm. Kinda ruins the meal."}
{"text":"We had a southwest chicken grain nowl.and it was GREAT.  The flavors blended well and the dressing was very good compliment to the toppings."}

{"text":"Concept and food are great. Service and food line not so much. Took a few attempts to get a \"to go\" salad i.e. dressing in the side. Also had extras for an \"up charge\" but extras were SCANT maybe half a spoon or scoop. Don't mind paying extra if I am getting extra. Check out is beyond slow. Good thing there is another location in Strongsville."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food. Many tasty healthy options. Unfortunately points deducted for the many tiny drain flies that swarm the register and beverage area. Fingers crossed that those will get under control."}
{"text":"nice and clean .. fresh ingredients .. good flavors... good stuff... but like some others have said...  some of the bowls are just too small for the price.  Also, always disappointed n the proteins.. its like eating kibble.. the pieces are so small that you cant really even taste it.. I dunno, my wife loves the place but she does agree with me with size and proteins.... and she is an RD.  Staff is pretty nice.. I was there once and the girl at the cashier spot was in another world.. but other than that... not so bad.."}
{"text":"Been here at least 6 times as it's an easy place to grab a nutritious meal. However I can never come here without a headache. Bad service, confusing menu layout, rude and unhelpful staff, inconsistent portion sizes, and under supplied. Rude treatment of customers and long waits for food in a place which is supposed to be \"fast casual,\" is common place here with no manager help or intervention. Core has such potential but is ruined by how it's ran."}
{"text":"This place has a great variety of food from vegan through meat eater.  It also offers so many gluten free options that I know I can go there and not get stuck eating the same thing over and over and over.  The people who work there are also all very nice and willing to help with a smile.  It was very busy when I went and things were handled orderly and efficiently.  I couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times. Each time I go, the service is amazing and the food is great. The price is also great for the amount of healthy and nutritious food you get! But something happened this last time I went..and I needed to share.   The manager was working in the food preparation line, which you don't see often. He was being extremely helpful and engaged with his customers as well as his staff. I was blown away by his determination to help.  I ordered something and when one of the employees started making it, I was confused, because it didn't seem like what I had ordered. I had asked the woman if this was the correct thing, and she said yes. The manager was listening and aware, you could tell. I am not picky or one of those people, I would have ate anything and everything that was given to me on their menu. So I said, \"OK, no worries.\" I must have still had a puzzled look on my face, because the manager came to the pay station and asked me, \"Are you sure that is what you want? We can make anything you want. We want to make it right.\"   After a couple back and fourths of \"No that is OK!\" and his persistence, he asked me to step back to the beginning of the line to make what I really wanted. And trust me when I say this, they were very busy, it was the dinner hour. I could not believe he went above and beyond to make sure I walked away happy and content. It was such a great feeling, even though it was a small gesture! It honestly made my day! Thanks so much."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Tuesdays ago with my father and goddaughter for lunch.  We were looking for a somewhat healthy place to eat that was close to us and CoreLife fit that bill perfectly.  It's located in the bottom part of the Block at Northway and has both indoor and outdoor seating.  Since it was winter whenever we visited there was no chance for us to sit outside.  That didn't matter though as the inside is pretty cavernous.  At the front of the restaurant is an area where you order your food and walk through the line adding some items like you would in a chipotle or subway.  After you pay you are free to choose your own seat and you ultimately bus your own table.  For lunch on this occasion I went with a spicy chicken and ancient grains salad while my dad went with a chicken bone broth soup.  Both of the employees that were working the line here were incredibly nice and talkative to both me and my goddaughter.  They even ended up giving us a very tiny cup of oranges for her which was very much appreciated.  My salad consisted of warm quinoa, antibiotic-free chicken, sriracha, shredded kale, broccoli, carrots, raw beets, scallions with a lime cilantro jalepeno dressing.  I really enjoyed the taste of it, especially the spiciness from both the sriracha and jalepeno dressing.  With all of the vegetables in it my salad, it felt really healthy as well.  For something that tasted this good it was a great bonus.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I loved how friendly the employees were and thought that my food was flavorful and healthy as well."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot! I'm a proponent of a healthy lifestyle and this place offered plenty of healthy food choices. I ordered soup and it tasted well!  The atmosphere of the cafe was ok but I liked a modern interior.  I would like to come back and try other things."}
{"text":"Pluses: Good food.  I enjoyed tuna poke grain bowl. Friendly staff.  Drinks are good.    Minuses: Line moves slow.   41$ for a 6yr old and 2 adults for lunch. Poor value. Portions size is a little below expectations."}
{"text":"I ordered take out here the other week and had mixed feelings about this place. My favorite thing about here is that the menu targets eating a wide variety of healthy, low calorie meal that has big taste and a decent quantity. Side note: I strongly dislike healthy places that serve minimal amounts of food and call it \"healthy\" - it's only healthy because I'm leaving hungry!   I ordered the Spicy Chicken and Ancient Grains and the Coconut chicken curry soup as well as the ginger honey lemonade. The lemonade was a fail; it was overpoweringly bitter with no hint of honey and maybe a little ginger. The coconut curry however was good. It had a nice even spice to it and was very tasty. Same can be said about the spicy chicken and ancient grains which included beats, quinoa, kale, and seasoned chicken.   I appreciate healthy food this is promoting as well as giving you a decent sized meal. The price is very reasonable for both quantity and quality. I will keep this place in mind for when I want to go out for tasty meal that won't make me feel guilty."}
{"text":"After a lot of nudging from my boyfriend and reading reviews I decided to give Core Life a try. The restaurant is large and very clean with cool decor. Per usual I asked the staff for recommendations and she suggested the south west salad. My boyfriend created his on bowl of basically everything that was available.   Core Life is a very interesting restaurant to say the least. It was a great atmosphere, but I was not crazy about the food. It wasn't bad but it did not make my taste buds do a dance. I just felt like my meal was missing something - mainly spices of some kind. I would give it another try and create my own bowl."}
{"text":"I was so excited to discover that The Block Northway now has food options! There are so many great stores here, and a restaurant was desperately needed. I'll definitely come back again to dine here in the future.   The Pros: -Spacious, well decorated space -Trendy music (not that laidback coffee shop vibe) -Delicious salad with a great balance of greens, toppings and dressing -Excellent fruit juice options  The Cons: -Pricey - $15 for an average sized salad and drink -Employees were kind and polite overall, but one woman wouldn't speak loudly enough for me to hear and did not put all the ingredients on my salad that I asked for -Free side of bread literally tasted like cardboard - I'd recommend not serving bread than this terrible stuff"}
{"text":"How lucky are we to have this new eatery in our neighborhood??  VERY!  I went to the soft opening for lunch today (I believe they open for real on the 24th) and I was blown away with the variety, the freshness and the flavors of these bowls!  You can choose from many healthy options.  I tried the Spicy Chicken Rice Bowl with broth and it was so good!  The Cucumber lemonade was refreshing and tasty.  We will definitely become regulars here!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is blah.  I ordered a sriracha ginger tofu and ancient grains bowl and the girl was complaining the entire time about how she wished it was 3 so she could be off work. Then, she marked down on her paper that I ordered the spicy chicken bowl. Luckily, I caught it before she put chicken on it. The employees just talked amongst themselves never acknowledging the customers.  I asked the other girl as i was checking out if they had unsweetened tea.  She had no idea and asked another customer who was on the other side to read off the drinks to her.  I really enjoy this place food wise, I just wish they would get friendlier employees."}
{"text":"What an incredible difference from the Strongsville location!! This CoreLife just opened recently, I've been to the Strongsville location many times but this location is much cleaner, friendlier service and just everything overall seemed better. I ordered takeout on my phone and it was ready very quickly and everything in my order was correct. The girl who brought it out to me had a smiling face and made sure that I had utensils in my bag.  I'm so glad that we have this location in Fairlawn now! I'll be visiting very frequently!"}
{"text":"First time there and was very surprised. Lots of choices, almost overwhelming. The items were fresh and the portion sizes are good. 2 people can split a large and be full!!! They have about 6 different drink choices.. some very interesting. They offer a free half piece of whole grain bread with your meal. There is plenty of seating and on the warm months you can sit outside. I had the chicken Thai salad - small. It was tasty and they put the dressing on the side as requested. Download the app and get $5 off your first meal."}
{"text":"I really love this place and their  healthy options. Ranch flank steak bowl is the bomb!  I crave it!!"}
{"text":"I did a build your own with spinach, broccoli, beets, peppers, celery, pineapple (cost extra), and egg (also extra), but even with 2 extras and the larger size it was only 8 dollars, which I think is inexpensive compared to other \"health\" restaurants in the area. The workers were fast but not in rush. Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"Didn't believe I'll like It, considering going over the menu before entering he building believed it was gentrified asian fusion place, but i enjoyed the grain bowl overall."}
{"text":"Since they are building up The Block Area and this is one of the first restaurants to open up, I definitely wanted to check it out!  I had read about the concept and was intrigued.  You either choose from remade favorites or build your own bowls. You can do greens, grains or a combo. Pick your veggies which are all prominently displayed and fresh, then pick a protein if you wish. They also have a number of homemade dressings for your bowls. If you'd like, you can also get soups.  The set up is an assembly line similar to a Subway or Chipotle.  When I was greeted, I was asked if this was my first time and when I said yes, they were happy to explain and walk me through the process.  It's fairly simple but there are a lot of options so it can seem overwhelming at first. You can also go for a small or big bowl.  I decided to go with a pre-made favorite, the Sriracha Ginger Roasted Tofu but subbed out the Tofu for Ahi Tuna.  It came with Baby Spinach, Shredded Kale, Broccoli, Carrots, Sprouts, Ginger, Basil and Sriracha with a Carrot Chili Vinaigrette.  It was excellent!!!  Everything was fresh a flavorful. I will most definitely be coming back and trying more offerings!  If you like eating with chop sticks, you can do that. While I opted just for water, they have plenty of drink options on the healthy side and not just Pop.  Speaking of healthy, that is their theme. They are going for a healthier option for eating out. I'd say they are doing fairly well in that area. They put a nice twist on salads that I find welcoming."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and vegan friendly!  This is a \"create your own\" concept where you can get a broth bowl, salad bowl, or salad and grain bowl with a variety of toppings. My favorite so far is a tofu and quinoa bowl with a spicy carrot and ginger sauce topped with tofu.   The menu is clearly labeled to identify vegan items and the staff are well informed about allergens and dietary restrictions.   If I lived closer I'd eat here every day!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in, I was extremely excited to try CoreLife. I loved the concept behind it. Everything seemed super healthy and the wide variety of drinks itself was enough to convince me to get in line. I ordered a small Tuna Poke Fire bowl and a drink for a grand total of ~$14. I'm a petite gal who doesn't eat a whole lot of food in one-go so trust me when I tell you that this small bowl is SMALL. Definitely NOT worth the $8.45 price tag. The food itself was below mediocre. The ahi tuna wasn't too fresh so I only ate two small pieces. Additionally, there's way too much sauce and as a result of that, the bowl was soupy and salty. The one thing I did enjoy was the drink. I can't speak for anything else on the menu but the Tuna Poke Fire Bowl was a thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Nice to have a healthy and tasty option available in town.  They have nutritional information for their menu items readily available.  Ive tried the bone broth soup and grain bowl.  Kids weren't head over heels about it, BUT...they ate their meals w/o a fuss."}
{"text":"I went to core life eatery during its first week, so I was very understanding that the new employees were getting trained. I decided to try the warm poke bowl. While they were putting it together, the server coughed (hacked) a few times right over my bowl. And she didn't even cough in her arm. She coughed over my food. We made uncomfortable eye contact because she knew she should have coughed away from the food. She still passed my bowl to the next server for sauce. While the bowl ended up being really good and flavorful, the coughing grossed me out a lot.  Overall though, the wild rice in the poke was a nice touch and was very flavorful. They gave a decent amount of tuna for the price and it tasted fresh. They had just the right amount of sauce in the bowl too. I would recommend this place definitely, hopefully they'll work things out with food safety as they get into the flow of things."}
{"text":"Omg!!!! Why why why do we not have CoreLife in Detroit???!!??  Apparently this is new to the Cleveland area as well... Comes from the east coast but is so sorely needed in the Midwest!!! This is basically the healthiest carry out you have ever had. No need to coat and cover up everything with cheese and dressings because everything here is fresh an good! We are vegan so I ordered the siracha ginger tofu grain bowls with miso dressing.  Fresh, crispy crunchy veggies with dressing for around 300 calories and large enough to fill you.  (Approx $20)"}
{"text":"I am addicted to the food here! I love their Thai chicken salad it is so good! The service is great too! Their drinks are good"}
{"text":"Strongsville recently opened up a new complex near Southpark mall and in it was CoreLife, so naturally I had to heck it out. And the place is really delicious in many ways.   The menu is pretty broad, customizable, and healthy. It has a Chipotle-style where your food is made right in front of you. I'v tried several salads and broths and every one of them has been great. But the real treat are the drinks on the side. Various teas, juices, and lemonades all made with interesting and different fruits and vegetables. It almost completes the meal.   I'll definitely be back to CoreLife, no doubt about that."}
{"text":"I stopped in as I was in the area running some errands and it was lunch time. I looked up the menu before I arrived and I didn't really expect much. It was just something new and it was close by. I was actually very impressed after my visit. The place itself is very clean and very spacious. They have tons of seating inside as well as numerous tables outside on their patio.   Foodwise I went with the Ginger steak and noodle bowl. A decision that was very hard to make and something that I typically would never order. I was very pleased with my selection. I never would have thought of mixing rice noodles with kale but now I'm thinking of ways I can incorporate that concept into my own meals! That is one thing I think that makes Corelife stand out from other places in Pittsburgh which is oh so important being the huge food city that it is.   Saving the best for last, I want to talk simply about their lemonades. I think seeing their different lemonades online was mainly the reason I decided to give it a try. While they still have your average lemonade they have a lot of unique flavors you'll never see anywhere else. First I tried the cucumber basil lemonade and I absolutely loved it. It was so refreshing and those flavors are surprisingly good together which I wouldn't have expected. Before leaving I also tried the cranberry cayenne lemonade. It was also delicious but a little too sweet for me. If they sold pitchers of their lemonade to go I would definitely buy one!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times.  Each time I've tried something different.  And each time I was amazed at my selection.  I keep coming back. Must be good.  This is a must try for healthy eats."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because it's NOT ORGANIC.  Otherwise, it's a dream come true for any health nut foodie."}
{"text":"The food is so good! It's nice to have less processed food choices and creative juices (cranberry cayenne lemonade is my favorite). The staff is all really nice and good at communicating the different options. My only gripe is who I assume was the manager. She was hyper critical and criticized one of the staff saying they needed to work on her portion sizes saying her flatten spoon on quinoa wasn't flat enough) which was disappointing after receiving such good service from the critiqued employee.  Even with that manager, I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Good fast healthier choice. Broth bowl could use a little flavor but I did leave off the sirracha so that could have the reason. Loved all the juice options. Tons of seating. Good service. I would like to go back to try another option."}
{"text":"Another new business in the re established North way mall. I grew up in this area and for the longest this mall was one of those blah strip malls. They have really revamped it with new businesses including this one.  Corelife Eatery combines fresh organic ingredients in a fast concept. You don't have to ruin your diet just by eating out. Compared to other concepts similar to this one in the area, this beats them for me. They offer a variety of food on their menu that isn't just exclusive to salads. You can get rice bowls, juices etc...  Immediately, I noted the fresh vegetables along the wall. They looked bright and not brown. Their lettuce is actually the nutritious lettuce and not intermixed with iceberg to create volume.   I really liked the different flavors offered in their bowls. They gave you more eclectic options such as falafels, beats, and chicken marinated in balsamic.   The bowl I got was a spicy Thai rice bowl. It was very good. Even though it was a set  recipe, I could tailor it to get exactly what I wanted. The only thing I did not like was that there was too much rice. Otherwise I will definitely be returning, when I visit my hometown!"}
{"text":"Great first experience, staff is very friendly and helpful. I'm vegetarian and love that I had good options to pick from. Went with the mushroom broth bowl. Too many sprouts, but they did ask me if I want them so next time I'll probably ask for easy. Love how they don't dump unnecessary calories and sodium into it. Broccoli cheddar soup is a little too thin and not as flavorful as I'm used to from Panera, but you can taste how wholesome the ingredients are. Best part of it all: THE LEMONADES!! An employee suggested I mix the cayenne with the apple and it was DELICIOUS. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a place like this to come closer to where I live! I LOVE the food and the quality is always amazing. Prices suck but unfortunately you usually have to pay more for food like this."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this review by saying I really wanted to love this restaurant. When I saw this restaurant open up I was excited for a healthy fast food option in town.  I ordered an ahi tuna poke bowl which was lovely. My only complaint there was that they were really skimpy on the tuna.  I also ordered a make your own grain bowl. I selected my ingredients and moved over to the register to pay. Then I notice that they were passing over what looked like a broth bowl and not the grain bowl I had requested. I pointed out the mistake and requested that it be remade. The woman at the register looked at the bowl and told me that I must have ordered incorrectly. I repeated my order to her emphasizing the grain portion. Then they agreed to remake it after having told me several times that I ordered wrong. Still, they seemed annoyed about having to remake the bowl.  The lack of protein is even more evident when you select falafel as your protein. A \"protein\" serving of falafel is two TINY quarter sized bites of falafel. It is a joke, really. When I purchase a bowl and it tells me that it's comes with a serving of protein, I expect more than two of the teeniest bits of falafel I have ever seen.  The freshness and quality of the greens/veggies are great and all, but the small serving sizes and super skimpy protein sizes are simply not worth the money, IMO."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy food! Wonderful service! I love the steak, bacon and bleu bowl... and the Sriracha, Tofu, and Ancient Grains bowl. Tasty stuff."}
{"text":"Excellent! Fresh and creative dishes! I got the Southwest Grilled Chicken Bowl.  It was satisfying and delicious!"}
{"text":"Bland bland bland.  I ordered a do it yourself broth bowl with beef broth.   It had no flavor at all.   Someone else got the vegetable broth bowl it was just as bland."}
{"text":"It was very nice to find a restaurant that has whole food eating options.  We were satisfied with our meals and the options offered both Vegan and carnivorous were plentiful.  The drink selection is unique.... But don't come looking for a soft drink.  I look forward to coming back and trying a different meal."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about this place, I went with my coworkers for lunch. I was torn between getting a soup or salad bowl, but went with a salad bowl.   I created my own, and did a spring mix, wild rice, chicken and you get four choices of vegetables or mix ins. They then toss your bowl with your choice of dressing, and it was the perfect amount.  For drinks, you could grab a bottled beverage or do one of their juices, cold brew coffee or iced tea for $3. I went for the house iced teas, and tried the cranberry lemonade and beet lemonade. Both were pretty good, and a little on the sweet side, so I cut my second drink with a bit of water. My coworker did lemonade, and didn't think it was worth the $3 but I thought the special ones were.   Overall it was a good place for lunch, and the ingredients were fresh. Their ingredients are antibiotic and hormone free which is nice.   My recommendation to the store is that they should have recycling for their plastic water cups and utensils please!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing if you like to eat healthier/better... Its about time Cleveland starts getting hip... Went in had the Tuna-poke salad and the vegetable broth.. Everything was amazing and i will be back every chance i get... Its a must try"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of healthy food then this place is definitely gonna makes you happy. They have variety of greens and you can make your own salad. We loved it."}
{"text":"I had the Thai spicy chicken noodles and they were awesome! What made them even better is they you can control the heat level and switch out the dressings or the meat to a different option. I think the menu items are all pretty much cham"}
{"text":"First of all, there are so many options that you could eat here twice a day for a year and not repeat the same meal. Everything on the menu is clean and healthy. After eating here, I have never felt weighed down or uncomfortable. My favorite item is the summer greens bowl that is only available this summer. I will be eating here every time I visit Bloomington Normal."}
{"text":"Fresh, quality ingredients. You can make your own bowl so there is plenty variety of options. The price is a little high for me but most \"healthy\" options are these days. If you are looking for something very filling and very flavorful - this is not the place. You can get dressing or use sriracha to spice up your bowl but otherwise there are no added spices, salts, butter or oils. Great healthy option."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best salads I've ever had! Never been disappointed and most likely never will be! All the staff is always so nice when I'm there and I want to try literally everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I only recently discovered this place and the food is very healthy and clean. I've become addicted to the broth. I sip on them now instead of coffee."}
{"text":"This place always has great service and delicious food. It's great to finally have a healthy food option close to work. I also love all of the tea and lemonade options, fun flavors I've never seen before. This will definitely be a regular spot for me!"}
{"text":"Safe to say this was my culinary let down of the year. I had high expectations. I ordered a chicken Cobb salad bowl and a Mediterranean salad bowl to go.  Pros: Nice space, clean, trendy. Staff were all courteous and friendly. The balsamic vinaigrette I had with my Cobb was superb. All of the ingredients were fresh. I love that. No wilty greens or old hard boiled eggs (ew, hate that).  Cons: I didn't get chicken on my chicken Cobb salad. I should have been more vigilant while they were preparing it, but I wasn't and I didn't notice until I got home.  I always roll my eyes when yelpers say this, but the amount of falafel was simply stingy. My advice would be to add more of your own toppings.  Nutrition info. I didn't review before I came, because that has ruined eating out for me before, I expect eating out to be less nutritious than eating at home. I expected more from core life though. I promise not to ruin it for you, but the amount of fat in the Mediterranean bowl for example, is just cray.  I suppose the solution is ask for half dressing or dressing on the side. sigh. My loss.   Conclusion: This is not a bad place, it's just not for me. I'm sad, even as I write this, because I was counting on this being a go to place for me."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. This was both healthy and tasty. I got the ahi tuna option and would go back for more. They give you alot I ate the one bowl two different times. If you want to add to it they also allow that such as other ingredients like avocado, olives etc. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get a healthy meal, better than fast food.   I love the steak salad very good!  And I love the different assortment of drinks they have, which is self serve.   They also have a nice outside patio with tables!"}
{"text":"I was really skeptical about this place when I walked in. They had lettuce in broth bowls and in my mind I thought it would be slimy and soggy. However I was completely wrong.  I have been here a couple of times and have not gotten anything that wasn't great. I even tried the broth bowls and the lettuce was not slimy at all. The staff is great and very knowledgeable, they aren't pushy and will explain things throughly to you."}
{"text":"Great spot for health-centric folks! My friends recommended CoreLife after going there during its pre-opening, where they grew to love the options and quality of the food. Today during my visit I got the Thai Chicken Noodle bowl and it was pretty good, but spicy! I really like that they have pre-set salad, grain, and broth bowls while still allowing you to customize as you go. Definitely a great place for those looking for good, clean food, but it's not a place I plan to frequent much."}
{"text":"Right on!!  A Dietitian's dream restaurant where everything is FRESH!  Who would have thought that this type of restaurant would fly in the Midwest --- more tempting to put it on the West Coast (where everyone thinks first).  Really hope this restaurant prospers and the word gets out to eat more healthy"}
{"text":"Tuna poke tasted great. Overwhelming amount of choices and healthy add-ons to meals. The teas and drinks were also a nice addition instead of fountain drinks. All food fit in my diet and left me full with how much volume my meal had"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I really like it.  Had a noodle bowl once and a salad bowl once.  Both were great, prepared fresh in front of me.  Both were very tasty and definitely more than enough to fill me up.  Took some bone broth home one day when I wasn't feeling up to par.  It definitely hit the spot.   I really enjoy their plentiful juice and tea/ lemonade selection, and they are organic.  You can make just about any lemonade or tea combination you'd like! My favorite is the coconut water fruit punch though, not too sweet and great for hydrating!  Every time I've been there the staff has been both very friendly and helpful.  If your body happens to need a detox or a break from junk food, this would be the place!"}
{"text":"I am always in search of healthy fast food in the area so was very happy to see this had opened up. I tried the Thai chicken bowl for lunch - perfect portion sizes (they have small and large), fresh ingredients and it left me feeling full but still energized for the rest of day. The chili sauce and cashew dressing were a nice addition. I also had the beet lemonade - very refreshing. So glad CoreLife eatery came to Mentor - it was very much needed! I can't wait to try something else on the menu next visit."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Meghan on this review. I've had this place on the radar for sometime and after our bad Honda experience we stopped for lunch here.  The menu is on the board but a description is given in the line area of salads, broths, grains, and build your own. Some of the items come in two sizes and usually you can get a meal for under $10.00 if you are not purchasing a drink.  I ordered a sriracha ginger tofu topped with grains. My husband got a salad with hummus. It comes with half a slice of bread complimentary. Drinks are extra but you get unlimited refills. I opted for the cider tea which I thought was different. They prepare your food right in front of you with the ingredients you can see through the glass.  The bowl I ordered had much kale in it and although I like kale I found my meal just too bland. The sriracha sauce was put on the side but when I tried it found it just too spicy for my taste. My husband seemed to enjoy his salad. It is nice that they give healthy food options and the calorie count but this place just didn't cut it for me.  Chances are I won't be returning. This place is hit or miss depending on your taste. For me it was a complete miss."}
{"text":"This is the healthiest fast food place that you can go to. They serve soups , salads , and different types of grain bowls. All of their produce is very fresh they have vegetarian ,vegan and gluten-free options available. You can order something from the pre-made menu or you can customize almost anything that they sell. Eating here I really feel like I'm doing something healthy for my body. Their beverages are very unique and I had the ginger lemonade which was absolutely fabulous. I also had the chicken curry noodle bowl which was great as well. I will deathly be back here and hopefully I can get my kids to eat some of the healthy options that they have on this menu."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the greatest place to eat in Strongsville! I got the Southwest bowl and it was amazing. The staff was very friendly, the prices were reasonable and the food- to die for. They have a large variety of fresh teas, juices, and lemonades and you get free refills on all of them. The food is very filling and it does not leave you feeling bloated or sluggish. It is a good alternative for anybody who meal preps and doesn't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"Corelife is the perfect place for eating healthy if you're on the go or if you want to stop and have a quick healthy lunch. There are a lot of options to chose from and everything is so fresh and really good! You can create your own bowl or pick one from the menu. The small salads are priced well and the perfect size. I really love the Chicken Cobb salad! They also have broths that are amazing! I love the beef broth it's really tasteful and comforting. Also there are many teas and lemonades to pick from, I love the cranberry cayenne lemonade!"}
{"text":"CoreLife Eatery is a more health-focused restaurant that focuses on serving food that is good for you, sustainably-made, and always fresh. Whether it's a salad-style \"Green Bowl\", a rice or quinoa-based \"Grain Bowl\", or a vegetable, beef, or chicken broth based \"Broth Bowl\", each dish features a selection of fresh greens, veggies, and protein options. The proteins to choose from include chicken, flank steak, tofu, as well as tuna for some bowls, along with a range of dressings to add bold flavors to your dish. You're given the option between a small size with regular serving of protein, a regular size with a regular serving of protein, or a regular semis with a double serving of protein. While each dish comes with its standard set of ingredients and dressing, you're free to add or subtract whatever you like from your meal option or build your own dish from scratch.  There are also kids' meal options that I think most kids would actually go for, as well as more traditional dinner plate options that are a grain, a veggie, and a protein. They also have a slew of in-house juice options as well as cold brew coffee.  The service is great. Fast and friendly. Depending how many people are here, it can take a few minutes to actually get up to the counter and through to the checkout. If you're short on time, they do have a call-ahead and pickup option available. On my second trip, I was half-way through my green bowl before I even noticed that my tofu selection was missing from the dish (yes it was that good).  I went up to the counter and said that I thought the tofu didn't get into my bowl. I was quickly given a double side of tofu to add and the staff was very apologetic about it. It's not a big deal to mess something up as a new business. I have a certain understanding that it can take a bit to get all the kinks ironed out, so to speak."}
{"text":"I would love to eat here every day if it weren't weird to do so. I love it. I love the concept and I love the foods they dish. I love that they have a wide variety of menu choices but you can also  build your own.   The price is just a smidge higher than I'd generally like to pay for lunch, but well worth it for the fresh quality of veggies and proteins they offer. The interior is nice and open with plenty of seating. Service is quick and friendly. I really love this place."}
{"text":"Delicious broth flavor and good options for vegans. Furthermore, they have smoothies in several flavors which complements the food. They have a Chipotle styled approach, but they have standard bowls to pick from as well. Well worth the visit. Also, did I mention it's really healthy, and the price point. One of my favorite places in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I couldn't disagree more with some of these reviews!! I have been here several times already and every single thing I've ordered has been flavorful with large portions, even for half sizes. Perhaps the team has been altering some flavoring based on previous reviewer experiences.  So far I've had the steak, bacon and bleu and the ranch flank steak salads. I've also had one of their noodle bowls. My boyfriend got their Thai noodle salad the other day which was also quite good. He mounds on the sriracha though, so not sure what it was like before that :)  Their cranberry cayenne lemonade is some of my favorite in the biz. The only thing I don't care for are the attitudes of their workers. I am rarely acknowledged when going through the line. Any customer service job demands that you at least semi-interact with the customer. I don't expect a red carpet, but at least smile and say hello.  I'll be back for sure. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Overall, just not impressed with this place. The employees don't really seem like they know what they're doing. They didn't seem knowledgeable of their ingredients or what actually came with certain menu items. I got the spicy thai noodle bowl. It was meh... one color, not a lot of meat, not spicy, little actual flavor. What disappointed me the most is the freshness of the ingredients. I don't think mushy grey bean sprouts are the least bit appetizing. I know they just opened not too long ago, but they still have a lot of work to do. I hope they get it together soon. Otherwise, I'll just go to hello bistro... which isn't a bad thing!"}
{"text":"I was completely disappointed by the food and service at this establishment.   I wanted to get the tuna poke without seeds and cucumbers which I guess was a problem so I got a BYO (build your own) bowl.   The server acted irritated that I asked what some of the different salad greens were.  When I got my bowl the tuna had some kind of dressing on it and seeds.  I asked about it and they said it was a miso sauce but I could see visible seeds.  I asked for no tuna so they scooped it off and their was still some of the seeded sauce in my salad left behind.  They were all out of clean silverware fro eat in customers and after I ate 3/4 of my salad I noticed that my bowl was DIRTY.  The guy next to me ordered their coconut curry chicken soup and I heard him say can I have ginger on it. The servers response was it will be extra but as the man pointed out right on their menu board it said it included ginger and lemon grass.  Their response was we have never put ginger on this soup ."}
{"text":"My first and probably last visit. Although I love the concept of quick healthy food choices, this is just not the place for me.   The ordering process was more confusing and disorganized compared to other fast casual restaurants. The employees did not seem well trained as none of my simple questions were answered and the preparer did not know the correct ingredients for my bowl.  My first pick was the shiitake mushroom & roasted tofu broth bowl. The vegetable broth was so bland and tasteless that it might have just been tap water. I took two spoonfuls and that was more than enough. I talked to the staff and the manager was nice enough to let me order something else. This time, I went with the tofu green bowl. Once again, it was a complete letdown. The dressing was sour and the tofu was wayyy too salty. I never knew it was possible to mess up a salad this bad."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch while shopping at the Block on Northway.   I ordered a make your own bowl with arugula, quinoa, corn, black beans, dried cranberries, and bell peppers. I got it filled with steak and feta cheese with a delicious cranberry vinegarette. All of the staff on the line were very helpful and gave me samples of two dressings I was torn between so I could decide. They also have a bunch of different beverages to choose from. I really liked the cranberry and cayanne lemonade. It does have a kick, but it was very refreshing.  The food was delicious! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good Salads and friendly ppl. I don't really care for the soups but my wife loves them."}
{"text":"Healthy food...fast and delicious. The menu has several vegan options, which are clearly identified on the menu board. Service was fast, efficient and relatively friendly. The surroundings are sleek and comfy with plenty of seating. This place is built on a great concept and I hope it represents the future of fast food."}
{"text":"So in love with this place! Being in the nutrition field, this is a dream. It's so exciting to see places like this open up to provide great tasting healthier options to consumers.   Upon arrival I was a little overwhelmed. There's pictures of bowls with different bases and options that all look amazing. I stood there for maybe about 5 minutes trying to pick from them. A worker came up to me to make sure I had no questions. I went for the build your own option on the medium sized bowls. This is a chipotle style service where you go around and pick a base, protein, veggies, etc. The medium bowls was enough for two meals for me. It was also surprisingly affordable.   I am very happy with the way mine turned out. Everything was very fresh and flavorful. I will be recommending this place to all of my friends/family.  I look forward to trying some of the pre-made dishes too."}
{"text":"Love having this healthy \"fast food\" option . I have tried several things here , but the bone broth bowls are my favorite . I customize what I want in them and the restaurant staff is very accommodating . I have also had the steak salad and broccoli cheddar soup . Love how the soup is thickened with cauliflower purée and not starchy thickeners . I eat gluten free and this is the perfect spot to dine in ."}
{"text":"I hate to say something bad about what I hoped to be a great healthy place to eat out with my family, and to be fair, we only had the soups, not the (wild) rice bowls or salads.  The whole ordering process was confusing and the staff didn't seem to really understand or be able to help much more. Here's what I can tell you... don't order the soup (or at a minimum, ask them not to add kale... it was bitter and truly had no place in the soup).  The broth had little flavor, but did perk up a bit with the addition of PLENTY of salt. I did enjoy the chicken, however. I even tried to add some Sriracha to give it a Pho feeling, but mixed with the bitter kale, it made the broth almost inedible.  They accompany their soups with a 1/2 slice of grainy wheat bread, which unfortunately didn't add substance or flavor to the dish.  We did enjoy the tea and lemonade selections. They were unique (cranberry cayenne) and delicious.   Here's to hoping this is just a rocky start. Next time we'll try the wild rice bowls."}
{"text":"Great option for people that want whole, clean, nutritional food. Great beverage selection (made in house). Plenty of options for vegetarian and vegans as well as meat eaters (chicken and beef). Nice atmosphere and outdoor seating. We will certainlybe back."}
{"text":"Healthier eaters REJOICE, you have a new choice in town.  CoreLife is a great concept of choose your own healthy salad, grain or broth bowls.  Complete meals in a bowl that are not only healthy but delicious as well as prepared fast.  Fast food does not have to be bad for you anymore. You pick the toppings for your own creation or tinker with the set menu to make your belly happy.  Don't want the chicken on your grilled chicken wild rice blend bowl?  Okay, substitute steak.  Don't want the wild rice blend?  Okay, pick kale and quinoa instead. That is what we did when we visited as guests for the soft grand opening Facebook promotion.    We found this eatery to be bright, open, and colorful.  The ordering station is chock full of healthy ingredients for you to create a delicious meal.  The ingredient choices are plentiful too.  Choose a base whether salad, grains or bone broth and build from there.  Staff was very helpful and quick to make your creation. I really like the fact that they make everything in house like the dressings, juices, teas, and bone broths.    Drink station: - so many healthy choices.  Many different flavors of fresh squeezed lemonade, iced teas and an iced coffee.  Mix or matching is allowed. Sorry, no pop choices here.

{"text":"Great choice for healthier option. Vegetarian and vegan options available. You can creat your own bowl or salad or pick from some pre created options. I've gotten the tomato basil & broccoli cheddar veg broth bowl and enjoyed them both! Also they have some different lemonade and teas. The beet lemonade mixed with tropical tea is yum."}
{"text":"The food and lemonade was pretty good, but I think it's quite overpriced. I ordered the pokei salad and really liked it, however I recommend asking for LIGHT dressing. They put so much on mine it was overpowering. Overall I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was exposed to Corelife Eatery at the Pittsburgh Yoga expo. I preordered the greens & ancient grains bowl with chicken, and I really enjoyed it! No complaints here. They're located a bit too north for me to make them a regular spot, but I'd absolutely be willing to check their resident out if I am in the area."}
{"text":"It's about time we got a healthy eatery in Strongsville! Had lunch there today with my parents and 12 yr old niece. We each tried a different rice bowl. My niece has had the ginger steak n rice noodle bowl twice in a row now. I had the southwest chicken bowl and devoured it! Oh and the lemonade with cayenne... so delish! The atmosphere is trendy yet welcoming. I love the display of fresh produce behind the service counter! I can't wait to go back and try more. Think we'll opt for the broth bowls next. Core Life Eatery - thank you very much for coming to our town! We've been saturated with fried goodies for too long. Fresh, healthy and good for your soul - I just love it!!"}
{"text":"After coming here once for a Yelp event, I honestly thought I didn't see myself returning given than healthy food isn't usually my preference. While my first meal here was tasty, I just wasn't envisioning myself craving coming here on a regular basis. However, after finding myself in Strongsville for one reason or another a few times, I actually did find myself coming back here several times. I found that it's much more satisfying and delicious than fast food, and just as fast as they prepare everything on the line. I've discovered my favorite is their broth bowls, which I like eating with chicken and veggies. Everything is ridiculously fresh, and lest you have any doubts, they do prepare everything in house in the back kitchen. I also am absolutely obsessed with their drink selection. They have at least 10 different varieties of iced tea, iced coffee, lemonade and juice. The seating area is also really spacious and lively. I was surprised how often I found myself coming back here and I'm glad I have found some menu items I really enjoy. I would definitely recommend trying this place out, even if you're not a health nut. You'll be impressed how great the portion sizes are and how full you feel without that beached whale feeling, if you know what I mean. Core Life is definitely a welcome addition to the busy Strongsville city center."}
