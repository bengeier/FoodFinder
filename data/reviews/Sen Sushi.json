{"text":"Price and environment is very competitive. If you want to try some small kitchen sushi, give it a try!

Servers don't talk too much though......"}
{"text":"First time to Sen Sushi tonight, read the previous review below and we were in the area so thought we would try it out. 
Eat as much as you like was awesome well priced even though it was surprisingly quiet there the service was prompt, helpful and friendly 
Any of the kamikaze rolls are worth trying I had the tuna and it was so good!
Red Dragon roll was one of the best I've had in a long time 
Will go there again for sure 
Oh and the interior was really spacious!"}
{"text":"Just simply amazing!
I've been a weekly regular since my family and I discovered this place two years ago.  I have yet to be disappointed.  Believe me, I tried other places but they just don't compare.
Good price, excellent quality.  Friendly and cozy atmosphere... what more can you ask for?  As for the owners... Sonny and Isan, you rock!"}
{"text":"Sen Sushi is a lovely little place that has great staff and great food. Their food is so fresh, and the tempura food is always piping hot. I would highly recommend the purple yam tempura and the philly roll. This is the go-to place for when you want fast service, tasty sushi, smiles, and a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I recently ate lunch here. I ordered a bento box. Service was good and server was kind. It's a great place to try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Good value, $17.99/adult for all you can eat at a Sunday night is not bad at all! 

Very nice staffs, we were the only table eating at the time, and the staffs kind and willing to make clarifications."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the sushi quality at all. Ordered the party tray for take out and pieces were small and the rolls were poorly rolled. There are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"I usually get party tray to go. Great value: price, quality, variety. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"It started with what sounded like a Caveman grunt as a greeting  from behind the counter when we entered. Food was 95 percent rice. I feel like I could have just gone to the grocery store and bought a bag of rice and saved myself 25$. Although I would have missed out on a delicious garbage roll... yes actual garbage in my roll and no apology. Not even an \"I'm sorry that you ate plastic\". I suggest going to sushi itto down the street. I don't know what the price difference is but even if it's a few dollars more it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Not Impressed!

The fish (salmon and tuna) and avocado was old and dry on the edges and the shrimp tempura was cold and soggy. The soy sauce was watered down a lot and the rolls and sushi were packed with rice. 

All around the food was nothing special."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for lunch and Sen Sushi doesn't disappoint when it comes to decent AYCE sushi for a good price. 

The sushi and sashimi taste fresh and I usually just load up on those alone since the tempura, sushi rolls and some of the kitchen dishes, like the chicken teriyaki, are only okay at best. I can only speak for the lunch menu as I've never been here for dinner, so I'm probably missing out on a lot. 

The decor is really nice and service is good. 

I would recommend this place if you are looking for a great value AYCE."}
{"text":"Ate this sushi for the first time prices are ok but now for 1 day my stomach has been hurting me and the staff were watching movies loud. Therefore the music and the mood were killed. We did not enjoy the food. After spending most of the night with stomach pains due to the sushi will never go there or recommend people going there."}
{"text":"Super friendly and incredibly low prices. Unfortunately a local establishment is incredibly superior, however still good to be around."}
{"text":"This was the worst sushi experience of my life. I wanted to walk out after my very first hand roll. It was a tonne of rice with a sliver of salmon. the beef teriyaki was sad meat. My AYCE menu had 3 pieces of actual sushi on it (I don't count egg as one). They were jam packed full of rice and it looks like each piece of fish was cut in half. It was a mere fraction of the entire piece. It didn't look good, it didn't taste very good and I'm home and immediately in the washroom. For $11.99 plus tax and tip, you could get a far better experience from sushi itto 1 block south. Way better everything for maybe $1-$2 more."}
{"text":"This is my go-to lunch spot at least 2x a week. The kamikaze Tuna (red Tuna!) handrolls are some of the best I've ever had and the rolls and nigiri are always fresh. I've had some of their hot food on take out and its tasty with good portions. The service is also excellent and quick if your in a hurry. I also enjoy the fresh orange at the end of the meal, a nice touch! Oh and did I mention that's it 10.99 for all you can eat... Thats a no brainer!"}
{"text":"Compared to Maple Sushi this restaurant stands out with quieter, more ambient atmosphere. Sure, at full capacity the server and the chef are overworked, but it seems to be a family run place, so understandable. Menu might not have as many items, but sashimi were great,  so were all the sushi and rolls we managed to try."}
{"text":"Was just at the restaurant for lunch today. First of all, they have changed their lunch all you can eat menu and have gotten rid of a lot of items, and it's not $10.99, it's not $11.99. Won't even serve seaweed salad at lunch time anymore. The portions that came were ridiculously small. Ordered salmon, chicken and beef teriyaki and I kid you not, the food took up 1/6 of a very small plate, Ridiculously small portions. Was never like this before, I guess business is not that good anymore so they have to cut back. I asked the waitress whether this is usual size portions and she said yes so people order alot. Fair enough, so my wife and I ordered 3 more orders of salmon Teriyaki and they only brought one more order. I will not be returning to this place again for all you can eat, what a rip off. Why offer all you can eat if you are going to be this cheap about it? The chef had some serious knife techniques to be able to slice the sashimi that thin. Terrible terrible experience, won't be going back, don't waste your money. Oh, and no shrimp tempura or ice cream for lunch."}
{"text":"Great value for AYCE fresh sushi!

I admit I was a bit fearful of trying it given the reviews, but the fish was fresh and pleasant! 

There is a bit too much rice in the sushi and rolls for my liking, but you just have to plan your orders accordingly (hint, hint ;)).

Their tempura is well done too! Crispy and flavourful. 

Favourite orders:
+ Smelt fish. If you're lucky you'll get the ones with eggs!
+ Deep fried squid balls
+ Deep fried scallops
+ Deep fried tofu
+ Deep fried banana & ice cream

The presentation of their rolls is also appealing.

Service was great, wasn't too hard to wave down the server and orders came out quick!

Definitely recommended as a budget friendly place. For us folks who eat out once a week, this definitely has me and the wallet smiling. 

Although not on the menu they do serve ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, red bean, green tea, and mango)."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the wife. Waited 23 minutes for the sashimi. Only 4 patrons in the restaurant. When it came out it was FROZEN! 

Then the waitress spent time arguing with me why frozen is how sashimi is to be eaten because it's winter and cold outside. 

Finally the manager got involved and the same lady said .. They are having trouble with the freezer. The sashimi was reserved after a brief Stent in the microwave.  Lol

Never coming back. 

Otherwise clean place. Other maki rolls were ok."}
{"text":"Not sure why the bad reviews at this place- their service has improved A LOT.
We never have to wait more than 15 minutes for an order.

The sushi is always fresh and delicious. Salmon is fresh as well. They have a good variety and selection for the dinner.
For the price ($18 dinner on any day of the week) it cannot be beat.

Parking is always plenty as well.

Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"This place is a classic. I use to come here all the time for my AYCE sushi cravings... At the price of $12.42 after tax for lunch buffet how can you not? This restaurant hands down has the best Dragon rolls you will ever try!"}
{"text":"the price/quality ratio at this place is off the charts.

It is easily the cheapest AYCE Japanese lunches i've tried but seriously one of the better ones. The smaller menu is a non issue with the quality of the food.

10.99 is for real, including weekends. No tricky fine print. Though I admit the first time  I ate here I honestly thought there would be a catch. There was none so I returned to check if I just got luck that day. It is the real deal. Everything as advertised.

I genuinely worry that they might close down because I am not sure how they make money. For now, I am a regular."}
{"text":"This place is very welcoming.  As soon as you get there everyone recognizes you with a nice smile.  The decoration is ehhh. You can tell that it was maybe an italian restaurant before with all European style brick walls and other stuff like that.   It seems like the new owners just added a little things here and there to make it look more like a Japanese  restaurant, but it really didn't do much. These things don't bother us at all because the service, the food quality and the price are all great!  What else do you want from a local sushi restaurant that you can go every so often.  The sushi, sashimi and rolls are all fresh and good portion size.  The deep fried tofu and vegetable tempura are good too.  Not a big fan of their beef or chicken teriyaki though, but still fresh and well done.  My son orders them every time.  In general we  have always had a very good experience going there."}
{"text":"I went for the lunch buffet which was very reasonably priced at $10.99. The restaurant is surprisingly big inside. Bigger than it looks from the outside. Looks like it may have been a Italian restaurant at some point. There was lots to choose from. The food was fresh and very decent. Not the best sushi I have ever had but very decent for the price. Service was quiet attentive and fast."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Very cheap lunch and so worth it. I recommend coming here on a budget. It's not the best sushi I've had but it's not bad at all. Fresh fish. The service was fast. Overall, a great spot, very peaceful and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was there with a colleague Thursday evening.  We walked in and nobody was there.  But we were greeted and seated right away.
The sushi AYCE menu was pretty extensive and included tempura, soups, edamame, etc.

We ordered a variety and it all came quickly, within 5 minutes.  The tempura was good, not greasy and sushi yummy.  No complaints at all.  We had fried banana for dessert and that was definitely worth the wait.  It has tempura batter on it and it may sound weird, but good."}
{"text":"I am a fan because of the value.  I ended up paying 14 with tip and tax for lunch. I think the list price is 11 dollars.  

This is my go to sushi place now.  I find the food to be pretty good.  I like this place because the weekend price is the same as the weekday.  I have been here twice, within the past month.  

I am mind=blown with the price.  I already told a number of people about this place."}
{"text":"Location: 2338 Major Mackenzie Drive W Unit 3 (Vaughan)
Price: $-$$
Service: Good

The lunch menu is really short but given the price for all you can eat being $10.99; it's worth it. It is actually one of the better sushi places I've been to. I also checked the price for dinner and it is 17.99 which is not too bad. Since, I enjoyed it a lot maybe I will return for the dinner menu soon.

Their miso soup was tasty- other places would have been too salty. My favourite was their red dragon roll! It was really really good. Another thing to order while you're there would be their beef teriyaki and deep fried squid balls.  Another compliment would be their sashimi, it was fresh (bonus)! 

The server was really nice so it made the experience even better. They have dessert but you'll have to ask them about it. Also, their interior design is really nice.. 

Verdict: Must Go!"}
{"text":"11.99 all you can eat lunch. For that proce ots definitely worth it. The sushi isnt wow but its not bad. Its normal but good considering the price. Would definitsly reccomend and will return."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!

This restaurant makes the worst Sushi, so much rice on the Salmon/Avocado Rolls that it's like All You Can Eat RICE (Hardly any Fish or Avocado).

It's so bad and if you leave a grain of rice on your plate the owner and staff threaten to charge extra money.
Total Scam, if I want All You Can Eat Rice then go to a Persian Restaurant; their rice much tastier lol (="}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout. I ordered the chicken dumplings or gyoza as they are often called. They came hot and crispy with a great sauce and were very delicious. The servers were very kind. I will be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service, waited an hour and a half to get one dumpling and a cup of water..... I cannot understand how a restaurant is open like this, how is this possible"}
{"text":"Reviews are either fake or by those that don't know Japanese cuisine.  The food is mediocre at best.  The lunch all you can eat menu didn't even have the most basic shrimp tempura.  They have an a la cart menu which offered four types of tuna, but when I asked to order them the waiter went back and asked and came back to tell me they actually only have one type.  Why leave a menu on the table for stuff you don't have?"}
{"text":"Love this place. My boyfriend and I always come for the $10.99 all you can eat lunch special and we always leave with both our belly and wallet full and happy. The sushi is fresh and made to order, which is great because it's rarely ever busy. We're usually the only table among one or two others maximum. The interior is very nice, looks Venice inspired. It is quiet and peaceful, allowing you to have a nice chat with the person you're out with or a perfect atmosphere to get some work done. The service is friendly and reliable, and they thankfully give you space and time to have your meal without being constantly interrupted. Overall, it's definitely my go to place for lunch sushi since it's a great value and it's nearby, and I always recommend it to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Bad operation- We were a group of 4 came on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was 1/3 full. Not busy at all. We ordered 1st round, the sashimi came to us 1/2 hr later after we finished other food. When we ordered the 2nd round, we were waiting for 45 minutes! After I talked to the waitress, our food were brought to us one by one. They missed a lot of our orders. It seems like there was only one person works in the kitchen. They cannot handle the capacity of even 1/3 of the restaurant.

Bad sashimi - my husband ate many sashimi, he had a stomachache and throw up at mid night. 

 Never come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Good sushi if you want AYCE without many sides. The service is HORRENDOUS. Don't expect to get a hello or how are you or even a smile. Don't go if you're starving because you will be waiting a bit."}
{"text":"It's very tasty try the California rolls and the dynamite rolls there's lights and cool decorations  it's great for kids and teenagers"}
{"text":"Came here as a last minute decision when a craving for sushi arrived. Checked yelp and they were close so we went. Upon arriving the first thing I noticed was the floor had not been swept. That makes me nervous. But we ordered anyway, they only offered the all you can eat, which since it was the wife and kids with me I figured why not (although not what we were looming for). I will say nothing tasted bad, but the handling I'd some of the items concerns me. Drying on tuna sushi, drying out of wasabi from being pre set up with the ginger and left uncovered in a fridge. 

Although I am not expecting high end sushi by any means, sweep the floor, properly store your products, have a little pride in your business. I will not return for some time. Maybe they left the B team there when I went."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the course of a year, and the experience has varied massively.

Having been here with a few friends, the sushi/sashimi was decent (not exceptional). The last time, the service was pretty iffy-- we ordered several things several times without getting any of it, then asked when we could expect it. They grudgingly told us that they were 'out' of that fish. Seems like the sort of thing they should have mentioned the first or second time we'd ordered it! The menu is fairly limited, but given the price, you can't really blame them. This does however make it more annoying when one of the items they have is missing.

I came here on my own once, and experienced, without a doubt, the worst service I've ever had, anywhere. All I'll say is that I was getting up to leave in disgust after being ignored for about 45 minutes when they actually dropped off the menu, and, again, had been about to leave when they finally dropped off the first dish. I should have left before they gave me the menu."}
{"text":"Who knew that the former   clothing store could be the local japanese hangout

Ok so it's ayce which can be a bargain for the hungry or go a la carte if you are a bird

$18 for dinner is a pretty good price and service is almost white glove.  Very attentive and unobtrusive.

They only serve what is fresh so if you order red snapper sashimi and it's not in the ice box you won't get it

In fact do not expect top drawer fish at this price point. So no real tuna or other exotic cuts that is flown in overnight from the tokyo fish market. 

So if you are looking for a great selection of Jfresh Japanese food then thid place will have you smiling on the way out

I strongly suggest the creamy beef rice curry bowl, the tofu, and of course the eel on top of everything else

I don't do rolls but my wife rated the red dragon roll as her new favourite over her usual generic dragon roll

Their house sake is pretty good too....

Tks yelper for helping me choose this place"}
{"text":"Stay away.  I should have walked when I noticed the sushi cook was also serving the food. 

Sashimi pieces were tiny. Rolls were mediocre. 

Miso soup barely had any flavour and took a long time to come out. 

Tempura was served luke warm. 

It seemed like there were only 3 people working there. 

Sketchy."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service, if your craving sushi and currently on a diet do come here because the portion is unbelievably small."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this restaurant quite a bit as my son loves AYCE. Went this past weekend with my friend and my son who wanted to order AYCE while I did not. I tried to order off the menu but I was told I'd have to order AYCE too. I explained I don't eat rice and they have no sashimi options on the AYCE lunch menu (we usually go at dinner). All I wanted was a sashimi lunch. They refused. I explained that we wouldn't be back. I think with so many sushi options in Newmarket they should try to accommodate their customers a little more."}
{"text":"Well for $10.99 ayce lunch is consider good. Service was good. Food is very average so can't complain."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Focused menu and great price. Got the food in time. Nice environment also."}
{"text":"Maybe they were having a bad day when me and my friend decided to drop by, but the sushi was terrible. Everything else was great - food wise - however the rice of the sushi was dry and the seaweed was chewy. If you have sushi in your name, that should be a carnal sin and something you should be aware of. Again, maybe they were having an off day! I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt due to their other food which satisfied us. The scallops were cooked to perfection - a feat not very many AYCE sushi places seem to get right. Beautifully crisp outside and soft inside. The gyoza was also delicious, and the gyoza sauce too. Above it all, their grilled bean sprouts! Oh my. You must, you must, you absolutely must try the grilled bean sprouts. We had 3 plates of them! Delicious, warm and not heavy at all. I genuinely debated asking to pay them extra if I could take a box of their grilled sprouts home but I didn't want to look greedy! 

The price for their dinner menu is also very affordable, under $20, which is great as not many AYCE sushi places are that affordable. I will say though that the interior was extremely confusing when we walked in. The pillars, the windows and the brick made us think we had walked in to an Italian restaurant slash pizzeria and we were thrown off guard for a second until we looked around and saw some of the accent decors thrown in indicating it is indeed a sushi place. There's a cute little private fresh sushi bar towards the back. 

I would give it 3 stars but unfortunately, we were physically uncomfortable the entirety of the hour and half we spent there. The seating! My ass hurts just thinking about it. The tables seemed too far away from the chairs so you had to lean over and sit at the edge of the seats to eat, leaving us crouched for far too long and needing to stretch occasionally. It didn't help that the benches we sat on weren't padded and extremely hard. Thinking of having dinner sitting on your high school bleachers. Definitely stop by for the sprouts and the food if you're in the area, however, I wouldn't again go out of my way to come here as the seating was a huge factor in leaving a distaste for the place in my mouth."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed.
Unfresh salmon is an understatement, expired salmon... that's about right.
$40 spent on picking up 5 rolls, had to remove all the salmon from the red dragon rolls, it was hard, dry and brownish, smelled fishy and god knows why i tried once... tastes worse than it looks.

Both of us have stomach aches... never again :("}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. This place was actually not bad, but recently they have gotten worse and worse! I understand that its all you can eat and you are able to order all you want , but their portion sizes have gotten ridiculously small. Quality has decreased too, they also increased their price."}
{"text":"Great price and great value. 10.99 for ayce sushi. Not as much selection bit perfect for people looking for a not as heavy ayce sushi place (if that's even possible). 

Great alternative to the upper Canada mall food court for sure. Well worth the short drive from the mall to get here."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi and cheap prices. Very friendly staff and the sushi chef makes the best sushi in Newmarket and I go here as often as I can. Many options! They don't only have AYCE! If you don't want all you can eat, ask not to get it. Every AYCE sushi place is the same, everybody at the table HAS to have AYCE."}
{"text":"My family and I come here often. The all-you-can-eat is great for the teens, but as a family, the party trays are the way to go. Lunch bento box + tip, $10 - great value! My favourite is the tempura bento box."}
{"text":"Came here today with a group of 5 people. 

Food: The food was mediocre. I would hope for a larger variety of options, surprised they didn't have shrimp tempura or seaweed salad. Sushi had a good balance between rice and fish. Some dishes were a bit on the salty side. Their yam tempura wasn't greasy and was very crisp unlike most sushi restaurant I've been to.

Service: There were a few parties of one or two but service for our table was very slow. They would give us a platter of sushi and once we devoured it within seconds, we had to wait about 15-20 mins for the next order to come. By then, our stomachs were starting to settle and almost failed to finish the remainder.

Interior: The decor of the restaurant itself was beautiful. I'm not sure what it was before but the décor almost looks like it used go be an Italian place. The washrooms are very tight (like tiger)

Price: Weekday lunch approx $12.50 after tax"}
{"text":"Sen Sushi is located where Sushi Song used to be. The interior is exactly the same -- painted brick interior with awnings and fake doors that makes it look like you're sitting in an outdoor bistro. And I swear that the food is exactly the same. This is my go-to spot for nearby, inexpensive AYCE sushi ($18/person for dinner). The maki rolls, sashimi, and tempura taste fresh. The fried scallops are decent. The deep fried squid balls not so much."}
{"text":"I love coming here. They are very cheap for an all you can eat restaurant. The staff is quick and attentive. The food always comes out really quick and well prepared. 
The only downside is that their menu is on the small side, but for what you pay it is defiantly worth it!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Newmarket. I live in Toronto but visit my boyfriend in Newmarket. We always stop by Sen Sushi for a bite. Compared to the basic sushi restaurants on Bloor St. in Toronto, Sen Sushi is actually better. Everything tastes fresh and all the textures are right. The special rolls are actually decently priced and the all-you-can eat is worth it."}
