{"text":"Thought food was good. Had dinner with my brother who does not like cheese. He ordered a Cobb salad and emphasized no cheese. Unfortunately there was blue cheese in his salad. Which blue cheese for cheese  haters has to be the worst cheese you could possibly eat. When presented the blue cheese to the waiter the waiter said no its Egg so he tried tasting it and in fact it was blue cheese. He asked for another salad and unfortunately there was also blue cheese in that salad. When my brother told the waiter he said no its not blue cheese. So we asked to speak to the manager and the manager came over and said \" no sir it's not blue cheese i asked the chef\". Clearly that's the worst thing you could tell a customer that what they tasted was not correct. So the manager asked \"so what do you want me to do\" so we told him nothing and ask him to leave. Worst thing you can ever tell a customer."}
{"text":"Set up reservation with manager Timm for  April 13th .  Our party had an excellant lunch , service was great , outdoor dining  was very enjoyable .Would love to come back for dinner  first class  all the way"}
{"text":"We went to Paul Martins last night for dinner and were very pleased with our experience.  This is a brand new restaurant created by the owner of PF Changs. Our waiter, JASON, was terrific and super knowledgable providing us descriptive details of the food and suggestions such as a Pinot Noir imported from California.  This restaurant has a woodsy/steakhouse decor mixed with a zen ambiance of candles and stones. It is a casual atmosphere where you can dress up for a three course meal or come in and watch March Madness at the bar.  I highly suggest the salt and pepper prawns appetizer.  Again, most of my credit goes to our waiter who was extremely knowledgable, attentive, and accommodating.  I will be returning back for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch 1/26/16 after belatedly discovering that our intended nearby restaurant wasn't open for lunch. Great experience from start to finish--from the interior design and finishes of the restaurant space, friendly, professional service staff and our meal. Fond memories of the wild mushroom soup and lunch special enchiladas. My wife enjoyed the fish tacos. Well done Paul Martin's!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour here this evening.  Food and service were very good.  Nice place.  I'd return with no hesitation."}
{"text":"went here for the second time tonight. our first experience (it's the food) not so great. so tonight we decided to give it a second shot. sadly, our second time was even worse. the service is okay. we always sit at the bar. it's the food that is extremely disappointing. our bill was $125. we had 4 glasses of wine, an app, a salad and the french dip. the french fries were the best thing we had. our app, the street steak tacos, just okay. loaded with giant bites of fat that i picked away before taking a bite. next our chicken salad and french dip. the chicken salad was BAD. the chicken disintegrated into a paste/powder. i ate about 1/4 of the salad. the french dip served on a focaccia roll. focaccia i've seen for breakfast and lunch sandwiches, not dinner. awful. i had a stomach ache by the time we left the restaurant. we are weekly patrons of houston's across the street and there is a reason. the food is ALWAYS good and the service is beyond amazing. we were looking forward to have a new haunt to enjoy, but houston's will be it, not paul martin's. very disappointing. food BAD."}
{"text":"If I could give this review 4 1/2 stars, I would!  Pulling up, the restaurant looks like it could be just another chain like PF Changs or Cheesecake Factory. However, there's a lovely ambiance once you walk in, and perhaps what helped it to stand out was the wide variety of fresh, locally sourced, organic dishes on the menu. We had reservations, which helped make the wait shorter... it was very crowded, always a good sign. Shannon was our server, and she was great; her friendly personality and eagerness to get us whatever we needed helped to enhance our experience. I got the Meyer Lemon Drop drink which was good. For meals, I started with the Butter Lettuce Salad with blue cheese, candied walnuts, apples, and maple vinaigrette. Very tasty and light enough to be an appetizer. For my main dish, I got the Vegetable Pasta. I was apprehensive about the vague \"seasonal vegetables\" that it came with, but was pleasantly surprised to find butternut squash, mushrooms, and lemony greens. Great flavor and very filling. Both dishes were delicious. Yum! We got dessert to-go as we were all full. The apple crisp and chocolate cake were both great. Give Paul Martin's a try! Not your average American grill."}
{"text":"My hubby and I had an exceptional lunch here today. We enjoyed great food, excellent wine and superb service. Mike G. and his manager (sorry did not get his name) went above and beyond to explain menu choices, ensure that everyone was done to perfection. We started with the Mushroom Soup, which was sublime. It was, by far, the best mushroom soup I have ever tasted. The table next to us said the same thing. Then I had the brick chicken (swoon) and hubby had the smoked pastrami sandwich. He is STILL talking about it. Instead of fries, he opted for brussel sprouts and I thought he was going to lick the plate. The service and ambiance are a cut above. We will be back within a week or so.  AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Went there on a Friday night.  Delicious food, fabulous staff.  Christian was incredibly kind and attentive.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, however it is another restraint trying to make simple dishes overdone. They do not  have any signature dishes which set them aside from most other restaurants. Service was fair I had to ask for water refills an three separate occasions. Their house bread at the table was nothing special. Do not go here with a group they are not set up to handle larger groups."}
{"text":"I just got back from Paul Martin's American Grill and I can honestly say I have never received worse service at a restaurant.  My wife, 8-year-old son and I were on an extended stay at a nearby hotel and decided to try one of the many well-reviewed restaurants in the area and decided on Paul Martin's.  I don't know who he is, but the place seemed clean, trendy and modern.  We had to wait about 20 minutes, which was okay. The dining area was pretty busy, and the Mexican place next door was also packed.  Our hostess was very nice.  Our waitress arrived promptly, took our drink order and then our food order.  She told us we'd be getting some bread and then she disappeared until we were almost done with our meal.  Well, \"disappeared\" is an exaggeration - she was still in the restaurant, she just studiously ignored us.  Our son's meal arrived fairly quickly, but after that, we waited (sans the promised bread), and waited... And waited.  Our meals came, and we had to ask the waiter  for the bread we had never received before.  For the life of me, I can't figure out why they brought our son's food out a good half hour before the rest of the table's dinner was ready.   A third staffer then inexplicably replaced my Diet Coke with iced tea.  Our original waitress eventually showed up again, we asked for the check and left.  The food itself was hit or miss.  My wife reports her steak was very good.  My own blackened redfish, however, was chewy and not very flavorful.  Although my son complained that his grilled cheese was not what he was expecting, I tried it and thought it was very good.  Portions were a bit on the small side, but that is almost expected at a trendy place like this.    And the bread, when it eventually came, was also very good.   We could see other tables getting good service (i.e., the wait staff actually paid attention to them and were laughing and smiling). Our waitress, on the other hand, was determined not to even look in our direction.    The only reason I can think of that we received so little attention is that our son was with us.  I didn't see any other children in the place, but it didn't seem that kids were unwelcome and he was well-behaved the entire time.  I must confess, I still don't know who Paul Martin is, but I know we will be staying within walking distance of his restaurant for another 2-4 weeks and we will not be back.  Had our experience been different, we may have eaten there several more times during our stay.  But our first impression was so bad, that we will not be giving him another chance."}
{"text":"The most important place to start: There is a restaurant that has been across the street for a long time with a great record serving up a very similar menu and doing it better. If you have been to this place I speak of across the street, and you like it, don't go to Paul Martin's.   This is a new location for an already established restaurant group, for that reason I do not allow the excuse of being new in regards to our not so great service. While our waitress was nice, she just wasn't very good. If I ask you what items are good on the menu don't tell me what people have been ordering a lot of that night. It doesn't answer my question. A restaurant like this should have had all their employees do a complete tasting of their menu.   After lack of guidance my husband and I collectively wound up with the spinach dip, mushroom soup, steak cobb salad and the short ribs. The meal itself started with olives from the Queen Creek Olive Mill and some seasoned almonds. We enjoyed those and thought we were headed on the path of a good meal, but not so much. Next our waitress brought us \"complimentary\" bread. She kept saying \"complimentary \". It was weird, pretty sure everyone eating at that restaurant understands when the bread hits the table you don't have to pay for it. Anyhow, it wasn't very good bread.   Next should have been our spinach dip but that took 25 minutes so my soup showed up first. It would have actually been very good but half the bowl was filled with a chunk of that not so great bread wedged into my soup. Finally the \"spinach dip\" came. Ok, if you have had that aforementioned restaurant's spinach dip, DO NOT ORDER THIS. It was whole leaves of spinach that were wilted in a runny béchamel sauce. Not only was the flavor lacking but it was hard to eat since it was whole leaves of spinach. Don't waste your time or money on that one.  The last round for us was my salad and my husband's short ribs. My salad was ok, not bad - but nothing to write home about. The price for what you were getting left something to be desired though. My husband's short ribs were a little bit of short ribs and 20 potatoes worth of mashed potatoes. Guess they make sure their margins are good on that dish. But the biggest issue there was the \"sauce\". The meat itself was very tender but the plate was like soup with a broth made of soy sauce with meat floating in it. This quantity of soy sauce made the short ribs SO over salted. Short ribs have become very popular on many restaurant menus lately and these were probably my least favorite out of many I've tried lately.   One of the most important things to note here, the bathrooms were FILTHY. I always find it concerning when cleanliness is not a priority in any part of a restaurant.   Final statement: go across the street."}
{"text":"Can't tell you if the food is good or bad. I made reservations on Saturday night for my wife's birthday we arrived on time they seated us right away then made us get back up and gave our table away all with an ATTITUDE. We waited another hour with no information, compassion or table we just ended up leaving. They didn't care at all. I won't go back!!!!! I still can't believe this! I see you have to be a certain color it be respected there!!"}
{"text":"Ok before I get started, I should point out that my 2 star review is solely based on the length of time waiting for the main entrée to arrive (to which Paul Martin DID make up for that!) Yes, this place is about 2 weeks old and some of the wait staff (at least where we were seated, on the patio) seemed to be very new.  No problem...I've been a newbie before too.  Our server was a little over the top with the constant mispronunciation of \"beautiful\", he kept saying \"bootiful\" and he kept reaching over us to remove empty dishes from the table; he just needs a little more training and seasoning and he'll be fine. The appetizer was a grill artichoke that we shared and it came with this great tasting garlic, pesto and basil aioli.  We devoured that in a short period of time. Next, we split the French Dip sandwich; the meat was a little too fatty and even though we split the dip, I mean c'mon Paul Martin, you can spare a decent amount of the au jus, can't 'cha??  The au jus was served in this way too small and too deep Japanese teacup-like container which it made it difficult to \"dip\" our French dip.  The horseradish/mayonnaise dip was creamy and good, pretty standard.  The shoestring fries was done well and crispy. We also had the mac and cheese that had pieces of prosciutto in it and it was a unique taste, the broiled top was nice and crunchy! With that being said, our wait time after we got the appetizer was way too long and appeared isolated however that is my biggest pet peeve is the food took too  long AND it seems that I am the one who has to recognize it and point it out to the staff.  Once I let the server know that it's taking a long time, it was then he let his manager know.  Manager addressed us and was nervous about approaching us (he seemed to be a young and new manager as well) and he did his best in explaining the situation but it was painful watching him stumble (ok, not so painful as amusing).   When the food did arrive, it did come out nice and hot so that was a plus!  They also comped our meal as a way of apologizing for the delay.   A golf clap for the food...and since they showed that in the end it is about customer satisfaction, we are going to try Paul Martin again."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about this restaurant.  Made reservations for Mother's Day. Arrived a few minutes early and was seated with minutes of our reservation time.   Nice booth   Our server Robert was top notch he explained the menu as well as brunch options.  We had prime rib and fish. Outstanding service. Great food and extremely well run establishment.  Had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"What a breath of fresh air....not only is the food amazing but the staff....wow. Made me feel like family."}
{"text":"With my family, I went to Paul Martin's during Sunday night eating the Sunday all-day prime rib special for $25. It is not the worst, nor the best either. I have a list of pros and cons to show why I put 4 (and not 5) stars.  Pros: Overall, the food is pretty good. The prime rib special comes with an appetizer of green salad, an entrée of prime rib with mashed potatoes, along with a desert with a shortbread cookie with three scoops of ice cream. Each of the courses were delicious: the green salad has fresh vegetables, along with the dressing blending all the vegetables together perfectly. The prime rib is very tender (with quite a bit of fat for most of our dishes) and the mashed potatoes were neither too mushy nor powdery. I was extremely satisfied by the size of the steak(most of us needed to box the steak) The ice cream is very creamy, and the shortbread cookies were a bit overwhelming, since there was too much sugar. The environment of the restaurant is relaxing, and it makes you feel as if you are in a movie theater. Fortunately, it was bright enough for us to read our menus, but I could use a bit more light.  Cons: The service was somehow disappointing. It was not as good as the last time I went there, since the waiter needed to be reminded multiple times in order to be told that one of our guests is lactose intolerant; he told us the ice cream is gluten-free. The waiters are not as knowledgeable as the managers themselves, since we asked if we could use a gift card that we bought the same day and he wasn't sure. We had to wait for quite a while in order for him to figure that out.  The food is not as good as what I hoped it to be, and I am somehow discouraged. I was not the slightest bit impressed or blown away by what happened today, mostly due to the lousy service. I truly hope that the next time I come back, I will not be dissatisfied again."}
{"text":"\"Meh- I've experience better\" totally sums it up.  With each course, there was something from at lease one member of my group of four that was returned to the kitchen.  Our artichoke appetizer was not cooked through.  My wife's fish, though ordered medium well was served medium rare.  The apply crisp was just a sugar coma on the plate.  The server was nice and that was the best part of the meal.  They did take care of the dessert to make up for the issues with our other items, but since that wasn't great either, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The management and seasoned service at this fine dining establishment are top-notch.  I would recommend checking it out!  75 wines by the glass!  Nice atmosphere on the outdoor patio.  Should get better and better!"}
{"text":"We just tried Paul Martin's for the first time with the Arizona Restaurant Week menu. Holy cow was it good! All the food was amazing, particularly the mushroom soup and the braised short ribs. Service was excellent as well, very quick, friendly but not obnoxious. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Great food and cocktails!  We went for the Monday night special and had the pork with hoisen sauce. A very good dinner and enjoyable time was had by all!  I've been here for apps and cocktails on previous trips to town and always enjoy it here!"}
{"text":"This place seems to have lost some spark since my last visit which was probably over a year ago. I had difficulty finding a menu item that looked appetizing and the value per item just wasn't there. I expected resort expensive but I left unsatisfied and felt like I paid too much. The service was adequate. The food tasted fine. The atmosphere lacked energy. I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Hi, I go to Paul Martin's with my assistant every Monday night! Not only do they have a fabulous happy hour, our bartender Derek is always sweet, and attentive, giving us great service. He always remembers exactly what we like to order!   I would recommend Paul Martin's for anyone looking for some casual, upscale dining. Go no further than Paul Martin's."}
{"text":"Wow! In my one month stay in Scottsdale,I haven't had food & service as great as I did at Paul Martins! First off the place is a very nice and modern place with a great ambiance, second the food was amazing from the appetizer to desert and third, our server (Joe) was the best! He was knowledgeable and attentive!  We started with the spinach dip which I liked but my husband loved! Then we let our server decide the entree for us and he recommended a great white wine as well as the kale pasta for me and a brick chicken for my husband and to my surprise they were not the most expensive items on the menu. Both the entrees were the best food we had in our entire stay! Then we went for the Apple crisp as our server recommend and it was amazing! It can definitely cure anyone's sweet tooth. I don't know who Paul Martin is but he is definitely doing a great job with his food and staff! I wish I would have found this place earlier in our stay, but now we know our spot when we visit again!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for our group of 4 on opentable - especially nice since it was for Mothers Day.  They called Day before to confirm - also a nice touch.   We had an amazing brunch experience.  Excellent service!  Our table ordered off the brunch menu, prime rib Sunday special and dinner menu.  Impressive that they had offerings from all 3 menus.   Paul Martins is an excellent restaurant and always a treat to dine there.  Every time I go I remind myself that we need to go more often!"}
{"text":"Amazing service here, everyone is friendly. Especially this waitress named Heather. She is on par with everything. I now make this one of my favorite restaurants and will request her when I visit. The food is made fresh which my stomach is really sensitive and I can only do fresh. Try the calamari appetizer and the shrimp pasta."}
{"text":"Paul Martin's used to be J Alexanders and I liked the old restaurant. Food was very good at typical higher end Scottsdale prices. $14 cheeseburgers. $28 entrees. $8 Carrot cake was awesome. I was disappointed to see it go out of business.  Now we have a California restaurant in it's place. I knew that the second I sat down at the bar. The place mat gave me the entire lowdown on the chickens. You know, the fact that they are not kept in cages. Is this important to you? Me neither. I just want a good meal with friendly service, nice atmosphere and a decent price. In this case, 3 out of four ain't bad.   It's California cuisine because it's food with a social conscience that beats you over the head. Free range chickens, ethical farming, fair trade espressos... you get the idea. if you love that sort of stuff (and in reality, I know it's probably your girlfriend who does) than bon appetit. Have a not very large and average tasting $15.50 cheeseburger (cheese is extra) and sleep better because the chickens aren't in cages.  The place does have a nice atmosphere, but so does Houston's across the street and so did J Alexanders.  Very friendly wait staff. Food delivery was quick. Beer selection is limited. Maybe the wine list was better. Don't know. Not a wine guy.  I left wishing I had been able to find a seat at \"Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers\" in old town Scottsdale. Good food at a decent price. Do they have ethically farmed local ingredients? They don't say and in all honesty I couldn't care less."}
{"text":"After visiting this stylish new restaurant three times I was disappointed in the food three times.   First time: After struggling to find anything on the menu that appealed to me, I ordered the fish tacos.  I was surprised to see the tacos made with Salmon.  If I wanted Salmon I would have ordered Salmon.  They were just ok but,  not what I had hoped for.  Second time:  I ordered a hamburger.  It was difficult to cut it in half as I hit on a very tough piece of meat.  Then, when I was eating it, I bit on a tough piece that I could not chew so I had to spit it out.  Lost my appetite for the rest of the meal.  Third time: Got to be better this time right??  I odered Tortilla Soup.  Huge  disappointment.  The bowl was small, there were VERY few pieces of chicken but, one the the pieces was a chunk of fat that had to  be spit out!!  Summary:  Disappointed in the food,  prices too high, happy hour below average. Many better restaurnants in town.  Paul Flemming.....how did you miss on this one?   My recommendation:  For great Tortilla Soup  go to  Roaring Fork.  For all other food, you can't go wrong at Houston's.  Nan"}
{"text":"We will not go back. Let's start with the music; totally inappropriate. Music should be more piano bar type instead of rock music. Most of the servers uniforms were too small and their bellies were all hanging out. We received three thin slices for two people. Really chintzyh! The house dressing was so spicy our lips were on fire through the dinner. The chocolate ice cream was gritty! I didn't like it. The salt shaker was a paper salt shaker?? I'd spend the extra money and go to Chart House."}
{"text":"We went there for New Years Eve. James was our server. He was great and the food was great. We had the salt and pepper prawns with the grilled salmon. The salmon was simple and one of the best I have tasted! We ended with the pear and huckleberry cobbler - great stuff!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Paul Martin's for the first time this evening. We were excited to try something new, but received the worst service I have ever experienced. It took a long time for the waitress to take our drink order. My boyfriend waited 20 mins to get his beer. After sometime we noticed tables around us had received complimentary bread, but none was offered to us. We had to ask. From the time we ordered our entrees it took us an hour to receive our meal. In this time a family of 4 was seated next to us. They ordered, received their meals and paid for their meals and we were still waiting. The food was not worth the wait. Our side salads were lettuce with approximately 5 grape tomatoes. The fish was over cooked. Our bill was very overpriced for the quality of food and service we received. We will not be returning or recommending this restaurant."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and sat at the bar with a friend, the bartender was really friendly, we told him it was our first time and weren't sure what to order. He suggested the pastrami sandwich \"which I had\" omg best sandwich I've ever had, the fresh ground mustard had me, not to mention the grass Feed beef. I mostly Definitely recommend trying the sandwich, I will be back to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"My husband had a hamburger and I had the polenta and vegetable dish with chicken.  We also ordered grilled cauliflower.  It was all very good.  And the waiter was charming.  Will go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Cedar planked salmon,  chimmichuri chicken and mac & cheese.  Awesome dinner for 2.  The best though was the mesquite grilled avocado appetizer - totally yummy!  Great service, great food - what more could you want?"}
{"text":"We live in Denver and come to visit Scottsdale once or twice a year. Dinner at Paul Martin's is always required, and we've never been disappointed. Contrary to what another review said, we've always found the service staff friendly and welcoming. Our latest dinner there was after a harrowing round of golf, and settling down in a booth felt like coming home. One of the features you have to notice is the quality of the butcher-block table tops. They practically glow, they're so clean. We started by sharing a grilled artichoke with aioli (sp?) sauce. I don't know how they make this dish so good, but it's better here than any others we've tried--and we've tried it often! My husband had the rib plate, with 8 big, meaty ribs and sides of coleslaw and french fries. He practically licked the plate! I had the Chesapeake Bay salmon, but put in a special request for spinach as a side, rather than couscous. I got the dish just as ordered, and it was delicious. The salmon was perfectly cooked, with a light onion sauce that was great. For dessert we shared 3 scoops of ice cream with shortbread cookies. The only shortcoming of the meal was the caramel ice cream, which was low on caramel taste or feel. The chocolate and vanilla flavors were great, and the shortbread cookies wonderful. Throughout our meal, our waitress and the rest of the waitstaff were cheerful and attentive. Yes, it was a pricey meal, but less than we had expected, and worth every cent of it! It remains our Phoenix favorite!"}
{"text":"Overall impression: Over-rated and over-priced for the quality of food.   Atmosphere: Great remodel of the old J. Alexander's with a more upscale feel. Layout is open with a bar in the rear that includes a few tables and lots of bar seating. When we were there it was quiet and slow. Tables are set nicely. Atmosphere is upscale.   Service: Service was attentive and friendly. Policies don't seem as welcoming. We were served a tiny dish of olives (1\" round dish that had 4 or 5 pea sized olives in it...maybe 1 tablespoon of olives). We asked if we could have more but were told that they would have to charge us $5 for another dish. If this had been a large dish of olives, such as the free plate of bread and olives that they serve at Houston's across the street, I could understand the charge, but this was a tablespoon of olives! We asked for bread, got 3 half-slices slices of bread which was good but almost certainly not baked in house.   Menu: Prices are very high but comparable to what you would find in steak houses in the area; however, the food is more casual (burgers, mac & cheese, spinach dip, french dip) so prices seem on the high end of what they should be. Starters such as cheese plate are $12 per person, spinach dip $14, and shrimp appetizer, $17. Entrees range from $13 for a veggie burger ($14 for regular meat burger), and an additional $6 for fries with that burger, and they go up to $39 for a NY steak.  I had the house made polenta and vegetables in tomato creme. The veggies were greasy overcooked. I was not able to cut them with my knife. The polenta was burnt (not just charred but black). It all sat in a lot of tomato creme which seemed to clash with the flavors of the grilled veggies. When the server asked how our food was, I said it was okay but I wondered if the polenta was supposed to be served that charred. The manager saw the polenta, apologized, and removed it. My dining companion had the chicken with mashed potatoes and liked it ($21). For dessert we had banana creme pie. Also disappointing. The crust had a thin ribbon of ganache on the bottom, topped by about 1/2\" of vanilla cream with a few slices of banana, topped with almost an inch of unsweetened whipped creme.  I wanted to like this dessert but it was bland. We left half of it on the plate.   We probably won't return. I would instead head over to Houstons for casual dining or Eddie Vs for steaks and seafood. Even though the prices were similar to other restaurants in the area, the quality was not."}
{"text":"Went here for a Birthday dinner - perfect spot for this!!! I had the homemade lemonade, it was full of flavor! Beware of the  salted butter with the starter bread, it almost kicked me on the ground. They also start you off with a small cup of almonds and olives. Not a fan of olives but the almonds are so nice. I chose the Marinated Skirt Steak for dinner and traded out the fries for mac and cheese. The steak was great, very little fat and flavorful. Mac and cheese was AMAZING!!! I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a bunch of friends after reading the yelp reviews. Thought it would be a good place to try. The food is really good! I had the Blackened Ribeye Steak and it was delicious! I highly recommend that steak. The reason why I gave this place only 4 stars is because the water glasses are too small and the service was just okay. I had to ask multiple times for water. In a restaurant like this, you shouldn't have to ask for water."}
{"text":"A great american restuarant. The burger is the best in the valley. Also like the BLT with great fries. You won't be disappointed with other items on the menu. The service is just great."}
{"text":"Bad service. I just went to HAPPY HOUR at Paul Martins with a friend. I am allergic to quite a few things so before we ordered, I gave the waitress a card that listed my allergies and she said she would take it back to the kitchen. I said ok as I pointed to the happy hour menu and mentioned that any thing on there would be good. They already have a few gluten free options, so I figured they could make some substitutions on one of the hh appetizers like they had in the past. When she came back she said they could do salmon and cauliflower to which I asked if that was an entree and then replied that I had a late lunch that was salmon and that I wasn't really that hungry and would prefer an appetizer. So she suggested seared ahi tuna. I asked if it was an entrée and she said that that was a salad. So I said yes that sounds good- I figure a small appetizer salad with some ahi tuna. No. A $28 salad.  I clearly came in for happy hour and told her I wasn't that hungry and left with a bill over $40. I suppose I should have asked how much it was, but I never have had a problem like this in the past. Also, when I mentioned it to her, she argued with me about it. The salad was good, but not really a \"salad\" and she should not have only suggested very expensive meals. I have had happy hour appetizers that are free from all of my allergies before. The meal tasted great though, props to the chefs!"}
{"text":"AmEx sent me a promotion for this place so I decided to check it out.  I got the skirt steak, the meat was very very good, cooked to perfection and very well seasoned.  Everything on the plate was great except for the portion.  I know its an upscale restaurant, but for almost 30 dollars you get 3-4 little pieces of steak, a bit disappointing. I also ordered the banana cream pie like someone recommended here, but I was not a fan, the cream tasted like it had been stored uncovered in the fridge with onions and garlic, not very pleasant.  The service was very good.  I will probably wont go again for food, maybe for a drink during happy hour since the place is really nice and has a trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try Paul Martin's during restaurant week. Great choice. Neither of us had been here before but I'll certainly be back.  We both ordered from the restaurant week menu. I had a wonderful wild mushroom soup and  grilled salmon. My friend had kale salad and short ribs. Both were prepared well and served hot. We had a great server who graciously packaged up our leftovers. We both commented on the nice ambience, and choice of music."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  We showed up around 6:00 pm for their advertised \"Taste of Paul Martin's\" happy hour menu.  I asked the hostess if it mattered where we sat for that menu.  Well, it did.  You have your choice of the high-top tables around the perimeter, the communal tables (like picnic tables with people packed in like sardines) or the bar.  As she pointed out, they were all full.   So I asked if we could be put on a waiting list.  No, they don't do that.  I asked if we could have made a reservation.  They don't do that either.  So, I said, \"so what are we supposed to do, stand in front of a table & wait until the people leave?\"  And the answer, shockingly, was unfortunately that's pretty much what you have to do.  She was sorry that was how it is, but that's how  it is.  So if a table opens & there are others waiting, whoever can run the fastest gets the table?  Is this any way to run a business of any kind, let alone a restaurant in Scottsdale?  We were also offered the outside patio, which NO one was sitting at.  Why, you might ask?  Because it's August and it's 106 degrees out and they don't even have any misters.  I am not that desperate to eat in their establishment.  We waited for a little while and realized it was a total waste of a trip & waste of time, so we left.  We will not be returning.  I have a feeling if I had not asked about the seating for the happy hour menu, we would have not been told and then been up-sold to their \"dinner menu\" and probably would have still ended up leaving anyway.  I would love to hear anyone else's experience with their happy hour seating."}
{"text":"Walked out before even ordering.  They were not busy at all but waitress took FOREVER just to bring drinks.  By that time we had changed our mid.  Very pricey and limited menu.  The name 'American Grill' can be deceptive.  Try 'Newport Beach overpriced nuevo American but mostly just trendy'..."}
{"text":"Came into the restaurant without a reservation on a Saturday with my wife and 7 year old son.  Was seated promptly despite not having reservations.  The service was efficient and friendly and very accommodating towards my child.  Although there was no children's menu, waiter helped us figure out a good option.  Ordered the salmon and steak and must say to our surprise it was beyond delicious.  Plus my son's mac & cheese was outstanding.  For those like us visiting the area for vacation, this is a great place to spend a meal.  With all of the options in Scottsdale and navigating local culture and attitude this was a no brainer."}
{"text":"First time yelp review, precipitated by a horrible dining experience. To be brief, here are the facts. Reservation made for 7:15, seated @ 7:45. Service so incompetent, we had to flag down another member of the wait staff to take our order; so all we have on the table is water @ 1 hour after our reservation. When dinner finally arrived, we hit the trifecta. Reservation not honored, lousy service, and the piece de resistance, crappy food. Would of given a zero star rating if I could, so buyer beware."}
{"text":"One of the Best burgers  in town, in addition to phenomenal customer service.  Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, food, and delicious drinks!! I'm craving the grilled artichoke...wow such tasteful food"}
{"text":"Thefreeters were very nice.  Our waiter, Courtney was friendly and very attentive.  He made some great drink recommendations.  The bread on the hamburger is very good.  This is a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had! Only complaint was the fries were a little salty for my taste.. That's the worst of it.. Friendly staff.. Swanky atmosphere.. Prices weren't unreasonable.."}
{"text":"An excellent place for any occasion. Besides the great entrees, grilled artichoke was awesome. Angelo was on top of his game with excellent service and recommendations."}
{"text":"Service - Exceptional   Food - Mediocre   Drinks - All were tasteful and well made  Atmosphere - Elegant and booths were comfy   Everything was great except the food was just ok.. Slightly disappointed. We came here for Valentines dinner but probably won't drive 40 mins to eat. Definitely will stop by for happy hour drinks though if in the area.."}
{"text":"Loved the food...service was excellent...a very cozy and comfortable restaurant. Also great patio seating.  One big problem was that they had nothing Vegan on the menu so it was very hard to put together a meal for myself. I'm hoping that you will follow suit and be adding some plant base items in the near future to go along with the rest of your wonderful menu choices."}
{"text":"Been there couple times. Had the dinner salmon, it is one of the best ways I've ever had salmon. I can't wait to go back for more. But, just FYI it's only at dinner! They need to have as a Sunday special!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place Monday as we knew it changed. Got seated right away and our waiter came quickly. Nice gentleman named Michael. Very pleasant. He explained Monday night was $49 wine/dinner night for two. We could pick ANY entree and any bottle of wine that had a box next to it. Along with that was two salads included. We were \"confused.\" HAHA We were excited that we stumbled onto such a great deal. We selected a bottle of AZ wine which cost more then the deal deal, but again, it was included! The salads were local, organic greens with champagne vinaigrette. Very fresh and nice size serving. We had the Chimichurri Hanger Steak that came with perfect shoestring fries and they were hot! Nice compliment to the perfectly cooked steak. We also tried the St Louis Style Ribs with corn on the cob. Ribs we tasty, not dry. The corn had a little too much cheese but it was good. The manager, Claude checked on us twice and we told him we would be back and how the service is impeccable and the food delish! There was also another manager who came by as well. They made sure our dining experience was a good one and it was. We will be back on a Monday. Best deal on town!"}
{"text":"Superb food and terrific staff.  I ordered the ribeye steak and it was cooked perfectly on their mesquite grill. The steak was simply damn good and will make one ponder about replacing their own backyard charcoal grill for a mesquite burner.   I was impressed by the staff, specifically the manner in which they worked together. From busboys clearing dishes to drinks being brought out, more restaurants could follow the training model of Paul Martin's American Grill.  It was in the higher end of price ranges, but for the area the cost seems comparable. It's not somewhere that I would go regularly for drinks because of the price. But rather a place to enjoy on occasion"}
{"text":"What a let down, Martin's quality falls well short of their pricing.  Ribeye might be one step above Applebee's.  Order a $40 ribeye and one would expect quality, instead you're  greeted with a grainy borderline New York cut.  They preach \"free range\", \"locally grown\", and \"made from scratch\" all catchy tag lines, but they don't match what is served on your plate.  Save your money, and try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to Paul Martin's for dinner and drinks with some work colleagues tonight and one of my co-workers asked about possibly ordering off the happy hour menu with our group who was all ordering dinner. Our waitress Amy who extremely accommodating said she would ask her manager for permission. The manager came over and told our group no there is no ordering of happy hour allowed in the dining room and he would not even allow the member of our group to walk to the bar and get a happy hour drink and bring it back to our table where the entire rest of the group was ordering food. I have been in restaurant management for 8 years and know how to handle customers and this situation was handled horribly. I'm from California and have worked in high end restaurants for years. The manager came over and basically whispered so other guests wouldn't hear. The name of the manager at the establishment was Clyde. The only reason I am giving this establishment a 3 star review is our amazing waitress Amy who did an outstanding job of handling the situation and keeping us in the restaurant after the extremely abhorrent handling by the manager."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends visiting from Chicago, good food and service was excellent."}
{"text":"I recently placed two orders to go. Both times the person on the phone was unfamiliar with the menu, and I had to wait on hold for her to go back and forth to ask basic questions. Both times I picked up the orders, they were incorrect. The first one was missing food--half the order. The second one had the French Dip prepared without following my request for additions. The au jus was way too salty, almost inedible. The mac and cheese was also too salty, probably because the ratio of prosciutto to pasta wasn't well balanced, which is a shame since this is one of the few places that uses good cheddar. Better fries could be had at most fast food restaurants. And the banana cream pie is certainly not worth the calories or money. Do yourself a favor and patronize any number of decent Scottsdale restaurants over this one, which is overpriced and overrated. Might I suggest Roka Akor just up the street?"}
{"text":"Excellent Restaurant Week selection. Beautiful decor, tasty food and excellent service. Our server, Angelo was knowledgeable and friendly. It could not have been better."}
{"text":"I love coming here for HH whenever I am in Scottsdale for work.  The food is very well priced considering it's on the fancy side.  I love the burger here.  Drink prices are also great and the bartenders here know what they are doing.  Highly recommend for HH."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch experience here.  Dark warm woods in the interior.  Felt like a lodge with modern accents (reminded me of Disneyland's Grand Californian Hotel).    My friend & I tried the Bistro Burgers (adding avocado and Arizona cheddar - a must).  As a fan of both Fleming's and Ruth Chris' burgers, I have found a new favorite burger in the valley!   Comes with fries (get the sweet potato - perfectly cooked and very flavorful).  Or try the house-made coleslaw - amazing.  We added a side of grilled corn with chilli aoli & cotija cheese - the description alone should tempt you...and it delivers big on flavor.    Capped it off by sharing a piece of the Devil's Food Cake - added a scoop of vanilla ice cream per server's recommendation - thanks Michelle! perfect compliment to the rich dark chocolate ganache in the cake.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Our server was the best, I mean over the top kind of service and I always appreciate over the top kind of service.  This might sound odd to you but we ordered a side of broccolini and I'm still dreaming about it.  It was so simple, yet sometimes the simplest of flavors seem to make my tastebuds scream the most.  So tip, get the broccolini all to yourself.  We also ordered a side of the macaroni and cheese, which was creamy, crunchy (from the prosciutto) and also a favorite.  My dish was the winner for the night.  The short ribs were tender and melt in your mouth good, that with the broccolini, what more do you need.  My husband enjoyed his skirt steak but was disappointed that the menu said potatoes as the side and he ended up with three huge tomatoes on his plate."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Paul Martin's for the first time on Saturday night... the service, the ambience, the food and the cocktails were outstanding.  Our server was knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and efficient.  Definitely will go back, and highly recommend reservations as it was quite busy. Parking is a little shy, however, the valet service is free and the guys at the valet were extremely friendly and quick.."}
{"text":"We went here with our kids and our particular mom. The staff was amazing and so accommodating. The food was delicious and fast. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The skirt steak had so much flavor! I wanted more of it!!  The roasted chicken was delicious with mashed potatoes as well. Great deal two entrees and a bottle of wine for $49:)"}
{"text":"Amazing, gourmet-style food, with the additional distinction of being of the organic/natural variety.  And so much the better, right?  Probably more of a 4.5 star than 5, but Yelp doesn't offer half stars."}
{"text":"Had a really nice anniversary dinner with my husband.  The service was great, atmosphere nice, a little loud, but it was a Saturday night.  The food was spot on...fresh, tasty and came quickly.  They even gave us a desert for our occasion.  We'll definitely go back with friends for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Myhanh took great care of us. I came with my family - who can be a bit difficult to serve - and we had a wonderful experience. I don't remember the last time I heard my grandfather say that he was truly pleased with a restaurant as he used to be an owner of restaurants! Thanks for the great food and phenomenal service!"}
{"text":"We visited this very sexy and modern restaurant for dinner last Saturday evening.  We were seated on the patio which had heaters if necessary.  Our server was Caryn, and she was on her toes at all times.  She definitely knows her menu and made many recommendations on the wine and the food.  She did point out the 3 course special which consists of a $30 per person menu + $5 glass of wine.  We both ordered the short ribs with the kale salad and ice cream and short bread cookies for dessert.  This was my first experience with kale salad and it will not be the last - it was delicious!  The meat on the ribs melted in your mouth as did the fluffy mashed potatoes.  The manager brought me the wine and he checked in with us later during the meal.  Caryn was delightful as our server and was both pleasant and interesting.  She conveys the mood of the restaurant - efficient, young, hip and in touch with the surroundings.  We left the restaurant very satisfied with our experience!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I were looking at different restaurants to have a small rehearsal dinner for family coming out of town. We so happened to stop at Paul Martin's for lunch and Clyde took great care of us from beginning to end- We knew this was a great place to bring our out of state friends and family. The day of the rehearsal dinner Clyde continued to take care of us and he made sure everything was perfect. We were so satisfied with the food and service that we continue to go back and bring the family to eat at Paul Martin's."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time for lunch during Spring Training. The food was great!  It was also nice to know that they make everything from scratch and use local ingredients. We had the kale Caesar salad, wild mushroom soup and the grilled salmon sandwich with sweet potato fries. Everything was great and very tasty. Service was also great. They accidentally served regular fries with the sandwich and they immediately apologized and brought out a basket of sweet potato fries. Definitely recommended and we will be back."}
{"text":"A celebratory birthday dinner turned into an odd experience where we had to manage our meal throughout the evening.  While appetizers went well, and I highly recommend the fresh flavorful oysters, we were well through the course before the drinks we ordered upon seating finally arrived.  Our dinner orders were pretty straightforward: two rib eyes and two strips all medium, one salmon and one redfish.  Two servers arrived asking \"Ribeyes?\" and we directed them.  This was the first negative tipoff - a restaurant of this kind should know who has ordered which dish and deliver them correctly.  In the longer than usual few minutes before the remaining dishes arrived, we all looked at the ribeyes with curiosity as they most definitely were not ribeyes.  Then came the servers with the strips (again asking who should get them) and we took the opportunity to swap the strip steaks (cleverly disguised as ribeyes) with the ribeyes (cleverly disguised as strip steaks).  Finally, a server arrived asking \"Salmon?\" and deposited Redfish in front of me and the final dish of Salmon was deposited in front of the birthday girl, who had ordered Redfish.  It equated to a very frenetic and chaotic orchestration which made everyone uncomfortable.  After completing our main dish swap party we found the following:  Ribeyes - very thin (1/2\" at best) and well done Strips - thick and cooked perfectly, mashed potatoes dry and crusty Salmon - cooked as requested but with a mustard glaze that sat too long and became dry and crusty Redfish - served cold  Our waiter handled the issues well, refiring ribeyes (now reordered as strips, as the thinness of the ribeye would make medium doneness difficult) and redfish appropriately and refilling drinks on the house, however, we celebrated this birthday eating dinner in 3 shifts as meals reappeared at varying times (can't coordinate the refires to arrive together?).  After the last entree was finished the manager stopped by to let us know he was buying the ribeye dinners.  Generous and appreciated but then dessert was served (all good, banana cream pie delicious) and cappuccinos arrived after dessert was finished.  We are of mixed opinions on whether to give Paul Martin's another chance.  What they did well was fantastic but many, many missteps made it difficult to enjoy the occasion."}
{"text":"6-7-2015 We had the most fabulous dinner! It was a last minute decision to drop in at Paul Martin's and it was the best meal of during our week in Scottsdale.  I had the skirt steak and husband had the brick chicken.  We ended with a shared piece of the banana cream pie.  The service was outstanding.  The food was so delicious.  AND the drinks were so fresh we ordered a second round.  Don't pass up this restaurant.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"1st time eating here and everything was delicious!  Started with the salt n pepper shrimp as an appetizer.  Enjoyed the warm hand towels they brought out after.  Skirt steak and cedar plank salmon were both AMAZING!  Mac n cheese was good, my least favorite of everything... Banana creme pie for desert had a small layer of chocolate on the crust.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went with a group last night and was surprised we were able to get in.  The service was very.....awkward.  It must have been our servers first serving job as well.  I chalked this up to being new so I'm not deducting anything.    Ordered the butchers board and appreciated the explanation about the different meats and cheeses. The \"mine\" bleu cheese was the best.  Ordered the prime strip and it was excellent.  Substituted the mashed potatoes and they were good but my friend said hers were cold.  She also just likes to complain.    Banana cream pie was good.  Had a kick to it.     Will be back again."}
{"text":"These were the Steak and Bacon Tacos with Avocado and Cucumber Salad absolutely mouth watering!  I apologize I didn't snap a picture of the Lemon Creme Burle with home made shortbread cookies before the plate was empty a must try.  Out waiter Cortney was on point and the patio was extremely comfortable"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday here rocks! Yes, the tacos are small but they are DELISH! They offer, salmon, beef (my two favorites) and pork for $2 each. They come on fresh, wonderfully chewy corn tortillas and you can order as many or a few as you like. They also have specials on margaritas made with house-made sweet & sour. I almost always get heartburn from margaritas, but not these, they are quality. This deal is only offered in the bar, but it lasts all day and night.   Their happy hour is also a great deal and I love the steak salad for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food.  We had 4 kids and they gave us a private room service was good. Kids food was good too."}
{"text":"Decided try this place out with  1st arrived wasn T sure cause place was pretty empty but the site is stay anyways cause it was kind of late on a  Tuesday our server Michael was great had some great suggestions on the meaning the fried chicken was the best crispy juicy and had a spicy crust the mashed potatoes  Are a must Super fluffy and lots of butter I also had a   Rib eye steak that was OK not the best I've ever had    I think it was just not enough   Marbling have lots of fat I'm outside Probly when not   go back for the stakes  Finish that off With a ice cream sundae There is mediocre nothing special what's get that next time over all but go back again just for that fried chicken"}
{"text":"This restaurant is exceptional! Food and service are top notch. The Moscow Mules were  refreshing, entrees were delicious and perfectly prepared. Dessert was the Lemon Creme Brulee. We will definitely be back...again and again!"}
{"text":"I have been to Paul Martins a number of times. Every meal I have had has been delicious. The pork chop is succulent, the cedar plank salmon is delicious all the starters are great. The bar is well stocked and both spirits and wine. The staff is very professional and they take pride in providing a good dining experience. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time there was on a Sunday and everything was GREAT!  They accept reservations!  We had 2 waiters (one in training) both were very attentive even as they got very busy.  They explained that everything is made to order and not pre-cooked and thrown on a plate.    We were extremely impressed with all the dishes that came out...even the vegetarian plate for my wife.  The char on the veggies from the grill made them AMAZING!  Their bartender even knows how to properly make an Old Fashioned (so many can't).  They even tossed in a free desert for my wife and I for our anniversary!  No question, we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We went here the other night to celebrate a birthday. We had an amazing dinner. My only complaint would be that they had made a mistake and undercooked some chicken for one friend at our table. They did take it off the bill. Still an awesome place and we will be back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to eat at Paul Martins tonight. He had the ribeye, which was the best steak ever. I had the fish tacos that were served with fresh cilantro, radish, and tomatoes; along with aoli sauce. They were delicious. Our service was excellent! The bread was whole grain and served warm. Irresistable...."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I absolutely love it. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is nice, and the service is consistently on point. I also LOVE that the majority of the food is local and organic. I had a girls night there this past weekend and we had a blast, the manager Mike came by and was super nice. My favorites here: mushroom burger, mushroom soup, kale Ceaser, the steak w/ chimichurri, short ribs, banana cream pie, chocolate cake and there is a lemon champagne cocktail that is delish!!"}
{"text":"Trent A (amazing bartender)  The most attentive and fun bartender I've had in a long time really made our experience special.   A must is the happy hour with the smoked wings amazing!!"}
{"text":"Bad. Just plain bad, especially for the price.  Food:  Appetizers Spinach dip- gross. Honestly disgusting. Most spinach dip is thick with melted cheese, cream, chopped spinach, etc. This was whole pieces of spinach in what seemed to be Campbells cream of (?) soup and some melted cheese on top. Comes with bread, not a dipping appetizer, I had to use a spoon to ladel some onto my bread.  Cheese board: pretty good. Nice variety of cheeses and meats, though it did not come with any additional bread or crackers. They price it at $12/person, which is weird and a little confusing (does each person have to pay $12 or can you just order one \"person\" for the whole table?). The latter is true and we ordered 2 \"people\" for 5 of us and it was enough.   Calamari: my favorite part of the meal. Fried really nicely and great flavor.  Entrees Prime new York steak: $42. Absolutely not worth $42. I ordered MR and it came medium. Did not taste like a high quality steak. Came with spinach with no flavor and fried potatoes which were the best part of the plate.  French dip: OK but not great. Fairly juicy but not what i would expect from a restaurant like this. The horseradish had the consistency of ranch and did not have much flavor. Fries were very good.  Short rib: very juicy. No real complaints but it didn't blow me away.   Two others ordered fish plates which I did not try. However both were swimming in some sort of juice/sauce and neither person finished their plate.  Dessert Chocolate cake: solid. Chocolate lovers dream  Drinks: Bloody Mary: spicy (good for me) but it was very thin looking and lacked flavor. Even my wife (who hates BM's) mentioned that it looked thin  Margarita: terrible. It was just sweet and sour and silver tequila. No gran marnier or orange juice or anything that resembled fresh juice. Supposedly the sweet and sour is made in house, but its a very poor recipe if that's true.   Service: Complete garbage for the prices they charge. We waited 5 minutes (at least) from the time we sat until anyone greeted us and took drink orders. Another 5 minutes or so to actually get drinks. Then probably 15 minutes before he came back to get our food orders, by then we just ordered our food an appetizers together.   The servers dont seem to help each other out much either. Each time food and drinks were brought to the table, our server had to make 2 trips.   Drink refills were relatively slow, but not terrible. Table management was awful. My margarita glass was empty after 15 minutes and then sat on the table for the rest of the meal until we stood up. One ordered wine but her wine glass was still removed from the table (prior to being served her first glass). When he brought the wine he had to go back to get another glass.   Overall we were there for 2 hours. Will never go back. If you want to pay the same amount for dinner but get a quality meal and excellent service, go across the street. If you want to get the same service and food but don't want to pay the $$$, go to....any chain restaurant of your choice."}
{"text":"STEPHEN IS THE BEST. I came from out of town for my birthday & Stephen was such a great server -- may I say the best I've ever had. You don't see many people like that. He made us laugh and we had such a great conversation! He was very attentive also.   I also was impressed when the manager came by and asked how everything was going and if there was anything he could do. My friend and I are both fairly young and we never get that sort of attention.   The wait for food was quick & the food was yummy!"}
{"text":"Was here 2 separate times. On both occasions the servers were amazing (John and Paul) the food was amazing (American Burger and Grilled a chicken Skewers) and the drink (Bistro Cosmo) was amazing! Would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed that one of my favorite restaurants did a less than a perfect job I wrote a less than perfect review.  I have since heard from the management with regrets and assurances that my next visit will see improvements all around.  I look forward to visiting one of my favorites again and soon!  Thank you for the caring reply.  I feel badly that I reacted so harshly. Everyone has a bad day - even me!"}
{"text":"Food overall was well liked. Very clean and neat atmosphere with a great out door patio when the temperature is right. Salt and pepper shrimp are tasty(not pictured because they were eaten to fast)"}
{"text":"One of our new favorite places to eat in town .. Amy H. Our server was great :) made it for an awesome experience :) thank you again Amy H.  Try their Pan roasted cauliflower as one of your sides .. Yum yum"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner service. The customer service here is top notch and their food is some of the best I've had. My girlfriend and I were in Scottsdale for vacation and decided on Paul Martin's for dinner - so glad we did.  We sat at the bar for a few cocktails and some of the salt and pepper shrimp. They had live music and the musical guest was excellent.    Our Bar tender was very courteous and engaged in some friendly conversation with us while we enjoyed our drinks.  The manager stopped over after we got our appetizer and checked in with us to make sure we were enjoying everything.  I thought that was great.  Once we sat at our table our server was absolutely awesome and very knowledgeable of the items on the menu. My girlfriend ordered the steelhead and I must say after I had a bite I wanted to eat the whole thing. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned just perfectly.  I had the steak tenderloin (med rare) and it was done exactly how I wanted. We had such a great exreperience. Paul Martin's does everything right. Thank you for being such a classy, well-run, high quality restaurant. If I ran a restaurant I would want it to be run just like this place.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Cobb salad I've ever had. I ordered it with chicken instead of the steak. It was huge, which it should be for $18. That's the only reason I'm taking off a star. I feel like a salad should be at most $15. The dressing was so good! It was blue cheese with a lot of dill. Sounds kind of weird but it was amazing. I'm a salad lover and if you are too, you know how hard it can be to have the perfect dressing! This salad doesn't disappoint. We also ordered the banana cream pie and again it was one of the best I've ever had. You could tell it was hand made. It wasn't super sweet like you would expect, which made it that much better. Highly recommend it! $10 a slice and a good size for two people.   This restaurant has really great food! I just wish they weren't overpriced. The decor is nice and it's a great place for a date night or w friends but I still feel like they could take off $3-$5 from every meal and it would be more reasonable. I don't think there was much of anything under $20 on the menu. Most was priced much higher than that."}
{"text":"Flew in from Houston today and decided to check out this restaurant for dinner.  The hostesses were very friendly and suggested the $49 Monday night special that includes 2 salads, 2 entrees, and a bottle of wine. Awesome deal! Our server Angelo was great and the food was incredible.  We highly recommend the cedar plank salmon and the shrimp pasta dish."}
{"text":"This is the best food I've had in a long time!! I went here when visiting family in Arizona and the food, service, and atmosphere was amazing!! I will definitely come here again on my next visit to AZ! 10 stars"}
{"text":"I feel a few years ago Paul Martin's used to be a great night out. Lately seems to have gone downhill a bit. My red wine was served over chilled, and my steak brought out bloody rare when I asked for medium. The menus which used to be printed on nice cardstock are now flimsy paper inserted into a laminated sleeve - ours were a bit greasy and not clean. Felt more like a chain restaurant. I will say our server Joel was wonderful. But I don't think we'll be coming back"}
{"text":"Best happy hour ever! I was in town on business and found this place while looking for something else. Happy hour steak frites at $13....WITH A BEER! Yes, truly wonderful. The prosciutto crostini was delicious and had so much meat, I can't believe it's only $9. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Shout out to all my Az peeps ;grab your friends , your dates and your lovers and head on out to Paul Martin's.. This place is 5 stars from beginning to end. For starters you will want to try the Town Dock Calamari, very fresh and lightly battered with delicious chili aioli and house-made cocktail sauce . I had the Chimichurri Chicken . Omg the savory flavors that bust in your mouth is amazing . Hubby had the marinated skirt steak with bourbon glazed sweet potatoes, and dressed arugula . This dish did not disappoint . A must try side dish ...Mac&Cheese Tillamook white cheddar and prosciutto . For dessert we had the seasonal dessert... Lemon creme' Brûlée with homemade cookies it was very light and refreshing . Everything is made from scratch and all their meats and poultry are antibiotic & hormone free . This menu is also Gluten and vegan friendly !

My friends do not miss out on this place !!!  As always if you go let me know what you think . Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Still 5 stars. They 86'd my smoke chicken and wings which was disappointing but had the salmon lettuce wraps instead. Again, another item that is deadly delicious.   For dinner had the brick chicken and it was perfectly cooked.   Overall, I will be back."}
{"text":"My visit to Paul Martin's was spectacular and exceeded expectations. Though it does kind of look like some other overpriced and stuffy steakhouse establishments, the atmosphere, experience, and quality were top notch.   I came with a large group, and they gave us the banquet room, which was the perfect balance between private and public. They made us feel special from start to finish.   The wine list seemed to please everyone who was into wine. And many of their bottles are actually on cask, so be prepared for your bottle to come without a label. I was more concerned with the beer list, which had anchor steam and hop nosh from uinta. Very impressive for a place like that.   My dinner was a stocked salad with julienned veggies and chicken. A huge serving that could be split between two less hungry people. Others in my group ordered the brick chicken, steak, and some other American standards.   Then came dessert: white chocolate pistachio and chocolate ice cream I believe was house made. Did not disappoint.   Overall a great place to spend an evening being taken care of and eating delicious food."}
{"text":"Overall I would rate this restaurant: 86%.   The layout, decor and ambiance of Paul Martin's are phenomenal. And the complimentary valet is a nice treat.   If you have a large group, I would recommend sitting outside on their patio. They have large couches that make for a comfy dinner space. The servers are very knowledgeable and attentive.   The food overall is a little pricey. The \"Brick\" chicken is wonderful, but I was not impressed with the Caribbean/jerk chicken."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant on a Sunday night. We were greeted promptly and seated right away in this most attractive restaurant. The decor is most inviting, casual, but, elegant. Our wait-person was friendly and extremely knowledgeable regarding the menu. They bring a small serving of almonds and olives to enjoy with your cocktails. We decided to split the Calamari appetizer. It arrive fresh and perfectly prepared. We ordered the  Chimichurri steak, and the house hamburger plate. Both came perfectly prepared, med-rare, as ordered. Both came with their house fries which were nice and fresh, but, a little too salty. The burger, with cheese was nice and juicy, made with flavorful beef. The bun, very important, was nice. The Chimichurri steak was excellent. Tender and flavorful, and, cooked perfectly. There was no room for desert, but, we did order de-caf coffee, which arrived barely warm. Most disappointing since this is the last thing served. I would definitely return, the entrees were excellent, the service friendly and professional, and, the decor beautiful. P.S.- they offer a daily special, until 7p.m. of a burger, fries and a beer, all for $13.00, a great deal."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon is a great time to sit down for an amazing meal. The fish & chips were good, and the NY Strip was perfectly cooked, medium rare. But, the desserts were to die for! We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Just finished our, I don't know, maybe 15 or more meal at this great establishment. The crab cakes with chunks of crab legs on top was great. My steelhead (freshwater salmon) on cedar plank was excellent. My wife and son had the incredible shrimp with  linguini and cleaned their plates.  You have to have the, unfortunately now smaller, chocolate cake with the highlight brandy cherries for desert. The best part to us is the extremely friendly service.  Thanks gang!!  Kudos yet again"}
{"text":"HOLY COW. This place is unbelievably good.  My fiance and I were very impressed.  The service was amazing from the hostess to the server to the manager who stopped by to check in on us.  The food was out of this world.  The spinach dip appetizer is probably the best I've ever had.  The Short Rib is unbeatable.  The Steak Cobb Salad is incredible.  My mouth is literally watering ... this restaurant is not only worth going to, but worth returning to over and over again.  ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"I visited Paul Martin's for the first time last night.  I loved the smoked salmon that I had.  It was outstanding, however they served a nice piece of healthy fish with 4 ginormous pieces of bread.  I would have rather had a vegetable or side salad."}
{"text":"I had previously visited the original Paul Martin's in Roseville, California so I was pleased to find that this location is just as good. Everything is prepared on site and the menu changes seasonally. Everything is excellent and prices are reasonable. Service was very attentive and if we had been there in the evening I could see that they had an excellent selection of wine and other beverages. Paul Martin's is an excellent place for a nice meal or to celebrate a special occasion. And although we sat inside, I noticed that they have a very nice patio that would be great to try."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place for a long time, but I knew it was kind of high priced, so it took us a while to get here.  The food was delish and we Loved the atmosphere! Definitely higher priced than I like,  but was worth it... for an every once in a while place."}
{"text":"One word sums up Paul Martin's American Grill: EXCEPTIONAL. If there was every an indicator about the quality of what was to follow, the perfect fried calamari appetizer would be it...and it was perfect in every way, which surely isn't common in my experience. The fried shrimp, grilled artichokes, and antipasto appetizers all echoed the calamari: great quality and perfectly prepared.  As for the main courses, the blackened ribeye was magnificent: perfectly charred on the outside, tender and medium rare on the inside, and impeccably seasoned (I despise the salty bitterness that I've experienced with this dish in so many other restaurants).  Next up was a Chicken under a Brick. All I'm gonna say is this: make sure at least one person in your party orders this dish! I guarantee after all of the ooh's and ahh's you hear coming from that person's direction, you'll be ordering it on your next visit too. It was outstanding.   As for the space itself...contemporary and inviting. The small, semi-private dining area in the rear is where you wanna be if you have a large party.   I read some of the other Yelp reviews, and I recognize that even the best restaurants can screw up a dish on occasion - this one included - particularly when they're pushing things out of the kitchen on a busy night (the place was packed)! But that didn't happen to me. My overall dining experience was exemplary. My only criticism was there wasn't any room in my stomach for dessert. Great job!"}
{"text":"***Great Place!*** Three of us sat in the bar at the communal tables, fun upbeat atmosphere with hip music - We were immediately greeted and ordered beverages (homemade lemonade is amazing!).  Our waitperson, Julia, approached us within 2-3 minutes, she was friendly, well dressed and very professional. She offered appetizers, suggesting some of her favorites, we asked several questions and were surprised that Julia not only knew the ingredients in each dish but also where the product came from AND it's all made from scratch! Love it!!    We ordered Salt & Pepper Wild Prawns * Town Dock Calamari * Kale Caesar Salad * Castroville Artichoke * Spinach Dip and ... we CONSUMED IT ALL  ( : Kale Caesar Salad was my personal favorite, exceptional product, white anchovies and the dressing was absolutely perfect. Least favorite was the Grilled Artichoke, mostly because it was just grilled artichoke. Overall, fabulous experience!!  Noticeably good quality product and nothing tasted sugar enhanced... Nice job PMAG - My new favorite place"}
{"text":"Ok we had bad service, we specifically asked for the kids meal first and put the order first, while we decide on what we wanted to eat. We didnt bread after we put the kids meal in and had to ask for it. All three of us orderd steaks, but the kids meal came 10 min after the steaks. Apparently chicken tenders take longer to cook. Then we had asked for a side of sweet potato fries all along with our steak, which came like 10 min after the kids meal. The waitress accidently spilled red wine on us. In the end weren't given any compensation or discount. Next time well have to think twice about visiting here again."}
{"text":"What and specifically where am I to eat in the Scottsdale area? Found it here - at the northwest corner of Rose and Scottsdale road! This is the new american cuisine to ease my curiosity of Paul Martin's style and techniques, and to ease my craving palate for different flavors. Oh the joys of summer has shineth upon us.   Our table was ready as expected with a reservation. Beginning beverage was the Raspberry Martini. House made infused raspberry vodka, lemon juice and sweet vermouth. Does indeed pass the sweet drink test! :)   Let's get straight to the food: Cedar Plank Salmon  - From the Classics. comes with shallots and bacon to give the powerful dominating flavors to best complement the cedar notes of the salmon, along with organic bloomsdale spinach, and crimini mushroom jus. This was a nice delicate dish to finish every last bite of.   Marinated Skirt Steak - thinly sliced with a pink center cut for the medium, with hearty mound of spinach on top.    Lemon Meyer Crème brulee - a seasonal dessert. Bits of lemon rinds in the crème brulee and 4 mini slices of lemon on top, and a couple biscuits. This is one of my many favorite desserts. I could just come back for this alone!   A phenomenal place for dinner, drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"This place only got 2 stars from me because they treat people badly based on there clothes. I was there with friends for a causal dinner and felt unwelcome and definitely got treated that way as well. I ordered a hamburger and after it was still not cooked correctly after the 3rd time. I was definitely ready to leave. Management never came over to speak with us or even apologize. But I did see them at other tables laughing and chatting with other customers. People still have yet to learn NOT to judge a book by its cover. I Will never be going back here again."}
{"text":"Came here with family for my Mom's 87th Birthday. The food was amazing and our server (wish I had gotten his name ) was so friendly and really made our celebration a special one!!'"}
{"text":"Great food and fabulous servers, John and Paul, two nights in a row. The happy hour menu is extremely reasonable with portions big enough to consider a light dinner. Bistro cosmo tasted great! We also had (over two night) the salmon crostini, American burger, deviled eggs and prosciutto and fog jam crostini. The atmosphere is comfortable and casual."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at Paul Martin's so I wanted to share it with the rest of the Scottsdale community. We arrive at 8:00PM without a reservation, not knowing if they were going to be able to seat us right away.. and they did no problem. Our waitress, Heather, was incredible right from the get-go. I have food allergies and she wasn't hesitant or put off by my inquisitions. She was willing to go above and beyond my requests and made me feel special like every other patron. When you have food allergies, most of the time, your options are limited to one or two \"safe\" things on the menu. Heather was able to offer me alternatives and meet my requests no problem.  FOR THOSE OF YOU WITH GLUTEN ALLERGIES/SENSITIVITIES - they have a SEPARATE fryer for their french fries, which means no cross contamination!! This is epic, considering most restaurants just pile them all in together. I was so excited to be able to get a bunless burger, with the toppings, and sweet potato fries that were super crispy and flavorful. It was one of the best experiences I've had eating out in ages and I can't say enough good things about their waitstaff, their food and their service. HIGHLY recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Need a NEW menu that describes what you are serving people!  Butter salad was all field greens with a couple pieces of butter lettuce.  Quinoa and bulgar wheat side dish was mostly arugula with a little quinoa.  Salmon was served dry and overcooked.  I had to cut it with a knife!  Noisy.  Came home hungry!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was really warm and inviting... The food was mediocre at best. I would have expected the food to be amazing, but it just wasn't. Very bland and tasteless. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"From the hostess, Serene, to the server, Steve, and bartender Dustin: Perfection. The banana cream pie is legendary."}
{"text":"Decided to try this nearby eatery and came away quite satisfied. While the food was slow to come out, when it arrived it was satisfying and very tasty. The closer for us was our server. Morgan was incredibly attentive and knowledgeable and made us feel like we were her only table. We will return."}
{"text":"Great tasting coffee. Had Valentine's Day lunch before leaving town. Had a burger and split a mac and cheese with the wife. The fries are fresh cut and never frozen.  Good food, fast service and friendly staff! Will return next time in town!"}
{"text":"Great eats. Wait staff awesome which is what is lacking a most places anymore . A little expensive but over all a great experience. I have tried the other restaurants in the area and this is the best."}
{"text":"I would go back if somebody invited me, but I don't think I would ever choose to go here on my own again. I've been here twice now, once for lunch and another time for dinner and I'm really not impressed. I feel like for $30 a plate the flavor a should really be there and each time this place has fallen short. I enjoyed my $7 burger the other day more than I enjoyed my $25 burger tonight. But on the plus side, they have good service and a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Walking into Paul Matin's American Grill, you'll immediately notice the awesome decor. We were seated on the patio, which was nice but extremely loud. Besides the noise and a long wait for our drink order, everything was really good. I had the hamburger and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Actually closer to 3.5 stars. The restaurant's menu is as generic as the name. If you don't like seafood or meat - you are certainly not going find much to eat here. The menu is not creative and the dishes are all standard. As far as the food goes...I had a burger and it was excellent - cooked to perfection, which is a plus. When I asked the waiter, he said the meat was organic, but I am suspicious because it wasn't mentioned that way on the menu. The salad that accompanied it was awesome too. My date had the polenta, which was supposed to be served with freshly grated Parmesan cheese,  but wasn't. She also mentioned there wasn't enough sauce served with her dish and had to ask for more. I had a beer, in which I was charged more then what the menu said it cost and she had a glass of wine. For dessert, we split the strawberry shortcake. Yes, it was delicious, but jeez for $10 could they be any more skimpy on the strawberries? There weren't even enough slices to taste one in every bite. It was more like powdered sugar, fresh biscuit and whipped cream with a strawberry garnish. Although they were thinly sliced, I can't imagine there were more than two and half small strawberries served in the dish. The service was very good. Perhaps, my only complaint is that our waiter did not give us enough time to try our meals before he asked how our food was. The manager did briefly stop by our table. I would not go back to this restaurant without another coupon and even then - it wasn't really a great deal. This place is way overpriced. I agree with a previous Yelper that Roaring Fork is much better. I'd also add so is Seasons 52."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after walking out of another place. I'm so glad we stopped here! There are not enough words to describe how amazing this establishment is!  We sat outside,  beautiful lighting,  perfect setting, comfortable lounging chairs and sofas, as well as elegant tables for 4. They select organic produce, free ranged and hormone free proteins,  and they have gluten free options!  Our waitress was amazing! She actually reviewed the menu with us! She let me sample wine before I purchased and she catered to our every need! Even one of the managers came to check on us! This was in celebration of an important event for my mother, and Paul Martin exceeded my expectations! We will most definitely be referring everyone and coming back on a regular basis!!!"}
{"text":"After the Manager  called us concerned about our disappointment with our entrees the last time we were in, we decided to give them another try. The service was still top notch. They have great servers.  We shared the Grill Salad and it was great. They have wonderful crispy crust sour dough bread. We loved the smoked salmon appetizer with a nice sauce on the side  We had the Blackened Ribeye and the Brick Chicken with a side of their special Cauliflower. They were both wonderful. For dessert we split the Apple Crisp with vanilla Ice cream.  So glad we tried Paul Martins again! Thanks everyone for a great experience."}
{"text":"I went here for my first time on Saturday December 19th, 2015. It is located in the Old Town Scottsdale area so parking was a little bit poopy. The atmosphere is dark, elegant, yet cuddly, just like I like it! We had reservations so we got sat as soon as we arrived.  The service here was AWESOME. Best service I have had so far. Our server answered any questions we had, offered suggestions on the menu and was very knowledgeable, and checked on us regularly. Then, there were server assistants/runners/bussers/whatever you call them that would come by and take your dirty plate and made sure you had a new clean plate and clean silverware. At one point I remember just barely setting my plate down and someone magically appeared out of no where and removed my dirty dish. WOW! Okay enough about the stellar service. Let's talk food.  We did the whole shebang. I ordered a glass of Educated Guess (Cabernet Sauvignon) and my friend ordered a cocktail (forgot which one). As an appetizer, we tried the Butcher's Board. YAY! Cheese and meat! It was a very neat experience trying the different things on the board. We finished that and out came our entree's. I ordered the Prime New York Steak with a side of mac and cheese. (I'm drooling and I haven't even begun to explain the heavenly flavor). So, my meat came with pt. reyes blue cheese butter. It was delicioso! The mac and cheese was bomb. The meat was EXACTLY how I ordered it: medium. It was so tender and juicy! My friend ordered the blackened ribeye with mac and cheese. He said his was amazing as well. He ordered dessert to go but I didn't try any because I was full. I bet it was amazing, though.  This place is a little bit pricy but it was worth it. Everything was beyond anything I've ever had. When this college kid can save up some more money she will definitely return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in our neighborhood, and we were anxious to try it for the first time today. Sunday afternoon, around 1:00 pm. We were greeted nicely from the hostess who sat us outside, per our request. At least 10 minutes later, after no one had come to greet us, much less ask for our drink order or ask if we had any questions about the menu, so we left. We eat out every single Sunday, we probably won't be back to Paul's."}
{"text":"We love Paul Martin's American Grill. The salmon grilled on a cedar plank is fabulous, and the short ribs are killer.  They have a wonderful deal on Monday nights (called Monday night wine dinner) and you get two organic salads, two entrees (any entree on the menu) and a bottle of wine (good selection) for $49!!  In addition, their Happy Hour is wonderful!  The staff is cordial and friendly (we like that in Scottsdale) AND they use local ingredients where they can.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"We made reservations for 11 this week for dinner.  Everyone was so accommodating and patient.  The drinks never emptied and the service was awesome.  We had the all the appetizers but the yummy bread was the best!  Calamari was ever so salty and fresh!  I had the skirt steak and it was cooked to perfection.  Juicy and tasty.  The lemon creme brulee was out of this world  The group loved the banana creme pie.    No negatives to report.  All the things!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a seat at the bar and decided to check out the happy hour menu.  Bartender knew exactly how to help me when I was deciding on the salmon.  Ordered the house salmon which comes with baguettes and creme fresh.  Excellent piece of salmon and the baguette was toasted just right.  Great dish overall.  The fiancée ordered the shredded beef tacos and no complaints for the $5.00 price.  It didn't wow me, but for $5.00 to enjoy some tender beef with a good sauce, you can't complain at all.  Lastly they we're talking my language.  A burger, fries and beer combo.  Burger is fresh ground in house and you can tell.  Ordered medium rare, and came out perfect temperature.  Toasted ciabatta bun and black pepper aioli.  Fries were  good but the hand crafted beer selection is even better :)   So to top it all off, the famous and home made banana cream pie.  Won't say much except you have to order it.....okay I will say it was damn good!!!  Actually all their desserts are made in house, so I have a feeling no matter what you order you won't be disappointed   Service, quality and value 100%. Absolutely will be back"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner, and had an amazing experience with Carl as our server. Not only was the service exceptional, the food was amazing. Try the prime rib!"}
{"text":"Steakhouse cobb salad here was superb. Service at the bar was spot on. Scotch choices were limited and very expensive - having 2 drinks with my salad put me at an $80 tab. Less expensive than flemings across the street, with comparable food, but still....."}
{"text":"Anna was our server and she was hands down amazing. We were visiting from Chicago and she made me feel at home here.... great customer service."}
{"text":"Great place . Monday special with salads entree choices and choice of several bottles of wine a great deal at $50 . Tuesday night fried chicken dinner at $20 also. Friendly efficient service. We will be back next time in Arizona for sure!"}
{"text":"I went here New Years Eve 12/31/17  There was a lot of parking outside in the entry area  I thought that when I walked in with my party of 4 there was going to be a little bit of a wait but NO we walked right in to a nice table close to the bar!!   There was a good amount of waiters and waitresses!! It being New Years night there were less than I expected!  We ordered our drinks pretty quickly!! Once the waiter brought us our drinks he did not come back for a god 7-9 minutes!! We kind of wanted to hurry our dinner up because it was late and a long day!!   When he came to take our order the food came out pretty quickly!!   AMAZING RIBS AND MASHED POTATOES!!!    After all this a great family place to eat!!   We had to wait along time for the check and when we had it ready to pay it took awhile for him to get it!   9.5/10  - 0.25 for the long wait between drinks and ordering  - 0.25 for slow check return"}
{"text":"I personally think this is one of the better happy hours in the valley food wise. We tried the the steak frites with a drink for $13 bucks. Also the hamburger with tillamook cheese + drink also for $13 dollars. The quality and flavor is superb. The complimentary bread and butter is amazing! Their Mac and cheese side is pricey but well worth it. In this visit I also ordered the avocado tacos on the happy hour menu and we all enjoyed them. Will be back again! Shout out to our server Courtney. He was great!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just amazing. We drove by the restaurant and decided to have dinner here. The food is excellent. I ordered the skirt steak and my boyfriend got the house special of friend chicken, corn and red potato salad. We also ordered a bottle of Hangtime (Pinot Noir) which was well chilled.   The atmosphere and decor is top notch. Very relaxed and well decorated. The wait staff is attentive. Picking up plates when appropriate and refilling glasses when needed. They are also very knowledgeable.   The GM stopping by is also to enquirer about our dinner was a welcoming experience.   I would recommend this place 100%. We will be coming back and also look forward to it!"}
{"text":"Our first time here! Very relaxing and service was excellent! James and the manager took care of us! We enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"We love to come to Paul Martin. The service is always exceptional, the food sumptuous and the ambiance romantique."}
{"text":"Quality food with excellent service consistently.  Try the burger or the salt and pepper shrimp both delicious."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful. The service great. The food was not great. My fish tacos consisted of a nice piece of mahi mahi covered with and I mean covered with sautéed stringed red onion and long pieces of parsley. The short ribs serving was very small and ok glaze-wise. The pasta dish was nice. For the price, nothing to rave about. If plain food that looks fancy is your thing then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Paul Martin's was a great experience for me. The place is very airy and semi-bright. I love the style/decor throughout.   Staff were all pleasant and adorned with smiles. The manager addressed the table a couple of times, when is always a nice gesture.   I had the pork chop, which was phenomenal! After a couple of bites, I was sold on the salmon too! The banana creme pie was not worth all the hype. The bananas were brown and very mushy...not what I'm accustomed to. But all and all, Paul Martin's is a great place for a first date, to catch up with friends, or to unwind with your significant other. It tends to get pretty busy, so make reservations!"}
{"text":"We had a good lunch. The difference between 4 and 5 stars was primarily the cost for a simple lunch with wine. I think it is a bit expensive for the selection and particularly the wines. The cheapest attractive entrees were $11 and the cheapest red wine was $9 (I bought a good wine for $10.)  I had tacos and they were good. Friend had burger and cheapest alternative was $13 but he says it was good. Both had salad which was good but on a hot plate. Excellent wine list by the glass though expensive. Beer list interesting but I didn't check prices. Good waiter and good assistants"}
{"text":"Ordered the eggs Benedict, which arrived cold after over a 30 minute wait. The potatoes that came with it were mediocre. Fruit plate and bread that came before the meal were very good, overall I was not impressed"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: casual dress code with a nice ambiance.   Service: Awesome, water glass was always full and our food came out timely. Our server was knowledgable. Every employee we talked to was very polite and courteous.   Bread & Apps: Home made freshly baked bread. Fluffy and delicious. We got the calamari and some oysters. Everything was awesome.  Dinner: I had the ribeye she had the chicken. Steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned deliciously. She loved the chicken. Both were served with mashed potatoes which were damn good.   Too full for sweets. Although they do have some home made ice cream which was tempting.   Everything here is cooked fresh daily. None of the sauces are pre made. You really can taste the difference. The price was also very fair. I've paid more for similar meals. With everything above including a glass of 12 yr scotch and a glass of wine our total was $120 + tip.   I definitely recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday, the first week they opened. I can understand that there are always kinks to iron out at a new opening but my experience was just blah. Not good, not bad.. I was with an elderly companion.  After being greeted at the front door the first question from the host/manager was do you have a reservation?  Not, how are you or how is your day going. (No, we don't have a reservation, its 11 am on a wednesday and you've been open 3 days..) We were then asked if we prefer inside or outside. I told them that my friend doesn't like drafty patios much so inside would be best. We were then brought to a table right next to the open screen of that drafty patio. While I thought it looked like a lovely enclosed patio with citrus trees and cute lights, that table was obviously not going to work.  After getting settled into a setback booth the awkward service,  or over - servicing rather, started. I think it was his first serving job so I can cut him a little slack, he was very kind and definitely friendly, just so so awkward. I don't understand it when servers announce their actions. (I will go get your iced teas and be right back with them, I will put your spinach dip in and be back to answer any questions, I'm going to take your plate if you're finished, I see you didn't use your silverware for your appetizers so I dont need to give you new ones..) its idle chatter, sounds unprofessional,  and is so unnecessary.  I know you're coming back with stuff I order...that's why I am here. Service should be unobtrusive at a place like what they're going for, you shouldn't interrupt your diners conversation to complete a list of service points you have to hit. They have a lot of fine tuning to do.  Another awkward thing was the staff that werent waiting on tables all standing around against the walls and watching service. I'm not sure if they were managers, corporate guys, or servers as they were all dressed nice. But the staring was uncomfortable..at least smile while you're watching. And you just opened, I'm sure there's something to do somewhere.  Oh yeah...the food! Nothing to write home about. Nothing stood out on the menu as different than any of the other upscale american grills in the area. They do use all local purveyors and boast a scratch kitchen, which is always a nice touch. I guess I was expecting some new and exciting can't get everywhere menu items to go with that."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  My kale Caesar had way too many anchovies for my taste.  Changed the whole make up of the salad.  My wife had the bbq pork ribs.  So fat.  And she subbed the French fries for a sweet potato.  It was actually a potato with sugar and the server argued it was an  organic sweet potato.  What a joke.  I would never come back"}
{"text":"Happy hour is only in the bar but they do not make that clear when they are seating you. The experience was nice, very cute ambience but really just mediocre food. Probably would only go back for the homemade ice cream."}
{"text":"Have had the pleasure of dining here several times & felt it was time for a review. Food today was great. Their mushroom soup is rich & delicious. My friend ordered the mushroom burger (vegetarian & comprised of several varieties of mushrooms). She was kind enough to share & I must say it was the best vegetarian burger I've ever had. Another friend was celebrating a birthday & the restaurant was kind enough to bring a complimentary dessert. Wish I knew the name as it was extraordinary ~ chocolate bottom with peanut butter, ice cream & topped with a roasted marshmallow. I would return just for the dessert.   Our server, Trent, was excellent as was the manager who made sure we were enjoying our lunch. Great food, great service & a beautiful environment."}
{"text":"A little slow getting service to the table but after that, smooth sailing. Delicious food, delightful server and great ambiance! We had the Marinated skirt steak (medium rare) and it was cooked perfectly! The grilled sweet potatoes were delicious!"}
{"text":"Honestly surprised this place has received a bunch of 5ers...  They've redone the old J. Alexanders - the patio is spacious and airy and today at least [it's still spring...] had blooming orange trees so the atmosphere was really pleasant. We sat at one of the sofa/table combos and it was comfy and not at all awkward to eat. Decent crowd, nice hum and could have our own conversation unimpeded by surroundings. Boom. We were firing on all cylinders. Until the food.   Service was prompt and attentive but not hovering. BP [biz partner] had the Asian Chopped and our server Dustin suggested the Greek Salad with Lemon Prawns [I was wavering between that and the Grilled Salmon Sandwich.] We both had iced tea - crisp, unsweetened, fine. Our salads came out and I was jealous. The Asian looked more appetizing than mine - better presentation and overall just looked more appetizing. Mine had whole butter lettuce [I mean, okay, but really? It's a salad. Why do I need to cut my lettuce, peeps?] Two different kinds of olives - which, if I really was an olive fan would have been great because there was very little else of substance. There was a nice amount of feta, way way waaaay too many tomatoes and I'm sorry, THREE prawns. Three. They tasted good but for $16, I would've had more protein if I'd ordered the sandwich. It just isn't a good value nor that great.  [$40 before tip for two salads and iced tea.]   It's just a 'meh' from me - even the outstanding patio space doesn't save it."}
{"text":"Lovely lunch on the patio. Nice place to visit with friends. A bit European - that is they allowed to visit and kept our coffee hot without any hint of \"turn the tables\". As usual the food was very good but not to die for. Just an enjoyable experience that was made better by our waiter John."}
{"text":"For us, Paul Martin's has turn into a familiar, home away from home.   Over the last four months, we have been here four times. The food is delicious and creatively prepared. We haven't had a bad meal or dish yet.   If UR into Happy Hour, theirs lasts until seven, this is a must try. They have some incredibly tasty items for $6 (see photos), like Street Tacos, panko breaded Tater Tots and Deviled Eggs. For $9 (photos), you'll be in heaven over their Maple Glazed Chicken Skewers or St Louis Duroc Pork Ribs.   Their HH Cocktails are $6 to $9 and their wines by the glass ($6, $9 and $14) have some real depth. Gotta love their 7 oz. Williamette Valley Pinot for $14. Try it, you'll see I'm right. It's a great pour, nice bouquet, and has a sophisticate mix of berry tastes.   Their dinners are equally great, whether UR here on Sunday for their Three Course $34 Prime Rib Special, or a week night, or even a Sunday Brunch - you won't be disappointed.   I could write more about their food, but I'll let my nearly forty photos speak for themselves. Expect to pay around $40 to $50 for a great value, tasty meal that you won't soon forget and cannot wait to come back to Paul Martin's for more.  One last thing, if you can, ask to be seated in James' section.  All the servers here are really great, but he is exceptional. He remembers your likes and finds a way to make your visit memorable.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A truly excellent experience all-around.  This Scottsdale outpost of the upscale chain features soft lighting, a jazzy soundtrack, and phenomenal food and service.  A complimentary dish of local olives and almonds kicks off the meal, with a small, locally-sourced menu heavy on beef (with several chicken and fish options as well). No matter your choice, you will not be disappointed.  I ordered the skirt steak, the slices of marinated beef cooked to a perfect medium rare and accented by the bright flavor of fresh arugula and meaty heirloom tomatoes. A wine list contained some formidable selections, with a few craft beers added in. Just as a fine cabernet sauvignon can compliment a steak, so can a bottle of North Coast Old Rasputin imperial stout.  Dessert selections were just as well-prepared and ranged from an assortment of house-made ice creams, a banana cream pie, and a decadently rich devil's food cake.  While not flawless (the bread, much touted by the wait staff, arrived lukewarm and with just a dab of butter), it is as good a dining experience as you will find in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We had reservations for dinner, but decided to swing by the bar first to take advantage of the amazing happy hour.  I ordered a delicious raspberry martini and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We were seated and really enjoyed the classy, comfortable atmosphere.  I ordered the blackened redfish with spinach and lemon - so light and good!  Fantastic service too...coming in on Halloween night was a great idea as the restaurant was really slow."}
{"text":"There's something to be said about consistency. Paul Martin's will never stray so I'm a big fan immediately. I love that this is in my neighborhood so it's almost like me cooking at home. Reservations are suggested but I've always been able to slip in and enjoy the friendly staff and yummy food. If you can snag a seat on the patio, even better especially during this beautiful weather. It's cozy and perfect ambiance to canoodle.  As recommended and tipped by fellow foodies, I highly recommend the Raspberry Martini. I probably would have imbibed on the great selections of drinks but only more reason to return since happy hour lasts til 7p. I loved the calamari as a teaser to start. And the kale Ceasar is pretty filling especially when you add salmon or chicken. I have to say I swooned over the niman Pork Chop which is major kudos given I always choose steak. I think it takes finesse to cook pork to be juicy and tender; hence, I didn't share though the portion was so big I had leftovers. The brussel sprouts were perfect accompaniment to the entree. Who refuses mac'n'cheese should never sit at my table! The highlight for me is truly the staff. They have such an ease and joyful smiles that you want to stay til close. I thought it was kind they didn't rush us out despite past closing time. I have no problem ending my day here and so should you."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for business/vacation and were looking for a restaurant with gluten free options.  Although it was a weeknight we luckily had made reservations as the place was packed.  Our server was great; tolerant and patient with our questions.  My husband was worried that the short rib would be dry (it wasn't) and I was worried that the filet would be over cooked (I said it needed to be \"mooing \").  All of the food came exactly as we ordered and in a timely manner.  Even the side (spinach) was flavorful and not over-cooked."}
{"text":"Upscale American bar and grill scene right in Scottsdale. Came with a group of friends on a Friday night and for good reason place was packed. We decided to start off with the Calamari which was prepared  Rhode Island's style which was lightly breaded with a chili aioli and a house cocktail sauce and also the salt and pepper shrimp cocktail. The shrimp cocktail was prepared perfectly which on the menu said lightly fried which you couldn't tell. Was not overly impressed with the sauce that came with the calamari. For my meal I decided on the on the brick chicken dish which came with mashed potatoes, Za'atar croutons, herb jus chicken dish which came with very juicy and sauce was even better. Other people in my group decided on the French dip with fries and the fries were regular string cut but a little bit well done and were great. Other people in the group decided on the filet which was the most tender well prepared meal of the group. This would be my suggestion if you decided to venture here in the future definitely try the filet.."}
{"text":"The happy hour was disappointing.  The food was sub standard at best.  Too bad, great ambiance."}
{"text":"What a pretty place for a lunch with the girls! We had a beautiful and delicious crudités platter and it is perfectly fresh and tasty. Heirloom carrots and yellow and green beans and tiny sweet tomatoes and more. The green goddess dressing is flavorful. We had the poblano chile relleno and  I almost had to 'had to' lick the plate. Tasty! Our friend who is vegetarian found lots of choices to her liking. Lots of great eats....surely will be back for dinner and drinks!"}
{"text":"Food not our style  It was several months ago we were here, just now getting around to posting this.   Food was not our style. A very good piece of salmon. And ruined it by smothering it in onions and spinach. I thought the spinach and onions were going to be a side dish. If salmon is farm raised or Atlantic then it does need extra work to get a good flavor, but WA or AK fish is outstanding with just a bit salt and pepper, cedar plank or fresh lemon. It does not need a lot to have excellent flavor."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend Friday. We made reservations so we were taken back right away. Our server was in training but he did an excellent job, more of the reason why I give it 4 stars is because the service was prompt and server kept us very well informed and knowledgable about the menu. Love also that everything is made from scratch and in house.   We started our night of with a glass of wine each, I was very impressed with their wine list and also how their selection of by the glass was quite extensive than most steak houses. We had the seafood platter as our appetizer. Came with fresh oysters, shrimp, lobster, and a salmon spread lettuce wrap. Very tasty, however the portions were VERY small for the price you are paying. I had the cedar plank salmon as my meal, it was good but could have been better. The sauce was very runny which made the presentation look very sloppy and salmon could have been cooked better. My friend had the rib eye steak, it looked amazing and friend said it was tasty. Had a piece of the broccolini it had as a side and loved it.  For desert we tried the raspberry crem brûlée and it may have been my favorite part of the meal. Cooked perfectly and moist.   With 2 glasses of wine later and a $200 tab we would say we enjoyed our dinner. Food would review as 3-3.5 but gave it 4 stars because of the ambiance of the place and great service."}
{"text":"Plus being an exceptional experience it was ALSO how effortless they did all the right things. Great food, great service and exceptional attention by the Manager! From walking in to leaving, embracing all the best of hospitality. Happy to be residents of beautiful Az. & Co.."}
{"text":"We had a great experience going here for our anniversary. The food was amazing!  We ordered the shrimp, fish tacos, and spare ribs. All were fabulous. Plus the servers were very attentive and kind. We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"REALLY loved our evening at Paul Martins!  Thank you for a great time ~ best food & best service!  Seriously, as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Went here while in town on business. We originally had plans to go to a restaurant next door but there was an hour wait so we tried Paul Martin's and were seated immediately. Server was very friendly and attentive and answered our questions about certain menu items and told us what his favorites were. Bread and appetizers came out pretty quick by we did have to wait a little longer for our entree's. Both the sever and manager kept checking on us though and were very apologetic. When the food did come, it was very good. I got the brick chicken which I definitely recommend. Very good experience and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Katherine was our Server and she was wonderful.   And the Happy Hour Menu is sooooo worth it.  Mushroom veggie burger with fries, and a beer for $13.00. Delicious."}
{"text":"I was between a four and five star review about #PaulMartins however the gracious service of the manager, Clyde swayed me towards a five star review.  Our meal was fabulous, the waiters were knowledgeable of their way variety menu and offered prompt service.  We began on dinner by ordering a bottle of their Cabinet listed on their Happy Hour menu. The wine was fabulous but I forget the name of the wine. I like wine but I nowhere near a wine expert.  After the wine was opened we order a dozen of the mixed oysters. The oysters were received with mixed review. Some types of oysters were definitely found more tasty than others.  I enjoyed a delicious bowl of mushroom soup. I love mushrooms and my bowl of soup did not disappoint- bravo to the chef for this delightful starter.  My husband and sister both were happy were their choice of salads.  My entree was a mouth watering generous portion of tasty ribeye surround by creamy mash potatoes. An entree of fresh salmon was inhaled by my husband and my sister took delight in each bite of her New York Steak. The New York Steak was served with favorable cauliflower. We finished our meal with three bailey's coffees and several desserts. I am usually not a big fan of ice cream for dessert but the sea salt caramel ice cream lingered with favor.  The meal came to a close and the bill arrived.  It was a pricey meal. However, every higher end restaurant is expensive. We all agreed the fabulous dinner was well worth the price. We will be back.  As a side note, the restaurant had a terrific vibe and good energy."}
{"text":"We had very overpriced salads for lunch, which were pretty flavorless and sparse with the ingredients they were supposed to have. Asian salad was bland & chicken was dry. Had to ask for more dressing. Not worth $19. Shrimp & Butter lettuce salad was bland, shrimp was good. Only a morsel of blue cheese and pecans in salad. Not worth $20 2 Redfish tacos were good, but again not worth the  price and came with no sides.  House ice tea was good. Wait staff was average. Atmosphere was wonderful on the patio. Will not return or recommend. Cheers"}
{"text":"Great service (Thomas was excellent). Very friendly and informative.   Love the bar set up. Ladies you can hang your purse and charge your phone!  Great daily happy hour menu with awesome hours 3pm-8pm.   Now the food... Great happy hour bites at a great price with no sacrifice of quality or taste! I'm sure the rest of the menu will not disappoint. Seasonal menu. Fresh ingredients. Love love love!   Just hoping Paul Miller brings this restaurant to the East!!!"}
{"text":"The happy hour has a great menu at a fair price. The service was great as well. The only thing that I was a bit disappointed in was that the happy hour is only in the bar area and the bar is very small with a few 4 seat high tables and two community tables. I have never really been a fan of the community tables. But overall the experience was great and the food was yummy."}
{"text":"The Brussel sprouts were so horrible I returned them after one bite. It was still on my bill when I got the bill. Trying to order was an ordeal. I explained to the waitress that I was vegan and would like the pasta. I asked them to make the pesto for me without the cheese which is very easy to do. She said they could not because they make it in big batches. This really means they do not make it at all. It is ordered pre-made. I asked what other sauce is available. She said they could add a butter sauce. I asked if they use a vegan butter. She said no. I asked about the Brussel sprouts. She explained everything on them including bacon as though that was a vegan product. I told I do not eat bacon. She said it could be made without bacon. I had to eat sweet potato fries for dinner because I did not want a salad and the Brussel sprouts were horrendous."}
{"text":"I had a really weird, really busy day. When I have such a day (it happens at least twice a week) I want someone else to cook for me. And I want a drink. So, I pass Paul Martin's twice a day. Last night I was starving and so many places close at 9. Paul was open till 10. Side note - I went to Taphouse Kitchen which states online that they are open till 10, but upon walking in at 8:40, I was informed in an unfriendly way by the bartender that the kitchen was closed. I am a bartender / server on weekends so I get the sense of a shitty attitude right off the bat. Can I do two reviews at once? Anyway... I walk in to Paul Martin's, was greeted immediately, went to sit at the bar. I am a vegan and can usually find something to eat at restaurants. Robert was behind the bar this particular evening and he assured that my needs were met, and he was also very pleasant to talk to. I felt bad because he had a couple come in at 9:57 and order a bottle of wine. They close at 10. No idea how long he was there. Great service. Great food. Had the grilled artichoke and quinoa bowl. Thanks, Robert. Will be back."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. A little too pricey. $88.00 FOR 2, no alcohol. Had the halibut $30.00 it was good, but not delicious. Shared the crab cake appetizer $16.00 FOR 1 crab cake. (That was good but over priced.)"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and professional. However, the food is way too rich. My brother and I both felt sick afterwards and we ordered different items on the menu."}
{"text":"Will not return to this restaurant.  Food is a big disappointment and management is overbearing and pushy. We waited over 30 minutes for food.  When we sat down 6 olives and some almonds were placed on table for 8 people.  After we ordered meals 6 slices of bread were delivered.   Mushroom  soup served cold, French Dip is ok (better in New River) and Prime Rib is fatty with a pile of mashed potatoes.  The best was the salad, but it only had several varies of lettuce in it, but dressing was good.   Can find good salads in many other places close by,  will not recommend to friends.  Prices are on the high side even for Scottsdale.  Waiter was best part.  He knew the dishes and was attentive to needs.   He deserves a 4 or 5 for his service and the handicap he works with the quality and management."}
{"text":"Paul Martin's has a lot going for it - too bad the stuff on the periphery was bad.   Paul Martin's is a nice and rather classy steakhouse that definitely reminds me of D.C. steakhouses. The lighting is dark but pleasant, the music energetic but quiet, and the ambiance rather pleasant.   The food is also good. I had the Sunday special offering, which is salad, prime rib, and ice cream for $25. The salad was good and had a decent flavor palette without being overwhelming.  The prime rib was tender and had an amazing spice rub that took it to the next level, but the interior was something of a vast wasteland of okay meat. The desert didn't happen for me - they had no options for lactose intolerant patrons, which was rather disappointing (and perplexing, given the upper echelons this place places itself in).   The service was rather poor. The server was clearly overwhelmed at times - at one point, he responded to our lactose intolerance inquiry by telling us that the ice cream was gluten free. It actually became rather offensive when we were made to feel guilty about using one of their gift cards - I have no idea why a steakhouse would make paying customers feel so awkward about using a gift card they sold!  Long story short, the food here is four stars, the service two. Three seems appropriate."}
{"text":"This place looks much better from the outside than inside.  I expected more both from the food and experience.  I ordered the Alaskan halibut and it just tasted very flaky and bland. Much better at other places. Glad I gave this place a try, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"In from Payson for the night. Heather was our server and she was awesome! She gave great recommendations on our wine and food. Very nice atmosphere. Enjoyed our time away from home. Food was very good and reasonably priced. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"WOW!! Great food, great service,  it needs no more words. Go try it and save me a spot at the community table in the bar."}
{"text":"Took my family here for lunch on Valentine's Day. Was pleasantly surprised. Was told right up front that everything is made from scratch. We recently moved to Arizona from San Francisco where 'made from scratch' is the standard - so this made us happy. The food, service, cocktails, atmosphere was excellent. We had our boys (1 and 2 1/2 year olds) with us and felt welcomed. I really enjoyed our lunch and wouldn't hesitate to visit again."}
{"text":"Here is a place that the food and service is always on point. Come for the Burger beer combo for happy hour, the burger was awesome. Not your traditional slider on most happy hour menus. Our server this last time was very attentive and even brought us hot towels after our meals. Great job!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype is about with Paul Martin's...I'd like to give it 2.5 stars, but rather than round up, I'm rounding down. Looking beyond the really nice decor and well done interior remodel of the restaurant formerly known as J. Alexander's, everything else seemed very lack luster.  I made a call to get a group of three on the waiting list on a Friday night, and the hostess almost seemed confused at my request. When we arrived, we were told that the hostess only had marked us down for a group of two...alright, no big deal, an honest mistake I guess. There was about a 20 minute wait so we decided to get some drinks at the bar. It was pretty crowded, but the bartender was fairly dismissive and not overly friendly upon our arrival, just a quick delivery of the menu and \"what will you be drinking?\"..hmm okay.  When we got the text message that our table was ready, the same absent minded hostess sat us, and only brought two menus. I'm not sure what the deal was, but we clearly had a party of three, c'mon now! When our server arrived, he was kind enough to offer a smile and a proper greeting. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer right away and had our drink order placed. When he came back over, he spieled the specials for the night - and REALLY emphasized the new bruschetta, which we had already ordered. At this point, the series of service miscues were almost laughable to us and we figured we were already there so let's just roll with the punches.  Entrees came out, and my girlfriend had the steak cobb salad which was good, her mom had the polenta which was fine, and I had the New York French Dip which is their \"twist\" on a prime rib shaved sandwich. It instead has shaved New York strip on it and I must say, I was completely underwhelmed by the flavor of the sandwich - just bland, bland, bland.  Honestly, I know I'm ranting and raving in this review, but it was a totally mediocre experience. It is amazing what a remodel can do to a restaurant, as it was pretty full and seemed more lively than when J. Alexander's was the occupant, but I don't think the food is any better - in my opinion, its not even as good and the service is definitely not up to par.   Maybe I'll give Paul Martin's a second chance, but I'll keep my regularity and loyalty to Houston's and Hillstone for my All-American cuisine fix."}
{"text":"We had dinner here this evening.  We had an enjoyable time.  I like the restaurant decor, hip and modern but unpretentious.  They give you tasty bread and butter to start.  Entrees were good but pricey for the portion size.  My husband had the Marinated Skirt Steak which he said was delicious.  I had read the Brick Chicken was amazing so I ordered it (and I never order chicken when dining out).  Honestly it was just 'ok' and when it arrived I wished I'd have ordered something different.  I could very easily make this at home and the skin on the chicken didn't taste very good.  Kind of disappointing.  But I'm glad we tried the place out.  I'm hoping to return to try their prime rib special for a little better deal."}
{"text":"The service is always top notch and the food is even better. I love going for happy hour with friends to get a burger, fries, and a beer for $13! They're full portions and a full sized beer too. The food is always outstanding and after talking to the waitress about their food I found out that everything is fresh and made in house. The only freezer they have is for the ice cream that they made!  Besides the burger I also highly recommend the street tacos and everything on their dessert menus is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I hope the food is delicious, but waiting now 1 hour for a French Dip, Pork Chop and Short Ribs is insanely too long! Seated at 7:30pm, ordered at 7:40pm it's now 8:46pm"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale from New York City for business. Great restaurant!  5-7pm happy hour special ($13) gets you a bacon cheeseburger with fries and a tall handcrafted beer. Nice deal! Big portions, nice simple flavors. Perfectly cooked. Homemade mayo was a nice touch.  What brought me here is that everything is made from scratch and they work with local farms and businesses. Their meat is also humanely raised. You can taste and feel the difference. America needs more places like this and we need to support them."}
{"text":"Brunch here is great! The champagne lemonade is a must. For $16 you get fresh fruit (fresh berries and pineapple) blueberry bread with honey butter, a cocktail and a breakfast entree. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. They have different chef specials during the beginning of the week. I will be back."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with the service, but the food put me over the top! Everything at this restaurant is all natural, made at the restaurant. Nothing is frozen and you can tell, the food was phenomenal, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Eric & Kathy best service & great time! I will be back for sure! Monday's the bomb!! Food was so amazing!!! Blazed chicken, short ribs YUM!!!"}
{"text":"The quinoa salad rocked- added steak, which really added texture. Loved the flank skirt, tender, cooked perfectly. Great evening!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 stars, because I am torn.  Paul Martin's is just \"okay.\"  The atmosphere and servers/service are great.  However, the food is nothing to write home about.  The selection is rather small, and the price was a little high for what we ate.  They also made some odd choices, like the fish tacos are salmon instead of the usual white fish.  The portions are a good size, and the French fries and mushroom soup were good.  I might try this place again one day, just to see if I can get a truly \"4-star\" experience."}
{"text":"I really love when Valley restaurants change up their menu based on what ingredients are in season, which is why I love Paul Martin's American Grill's new fall/winter menu, available through March, featuring really tasty items. I tried some really delicious dishes on a recent happy hour visit to the restaurant, which, like I discovered on my first lunchtime visit to the restaurant, I love for its relaxed yet classy atmosphere and exceptional service.  The restaurant uses local produce in its dishes, which made eating vegetarian items like the Castroville Artichoke with pesto aioli ($13) and Wild Museum Soup ($9) so enjoyable.  Eating a large artichoke is always a little hard to handle, but it's also a lot of fun, especially when it's tasty and mesquite-grilled like this one. It was a really great vegetarian option that was perfect for two people, and I loved the smoky qualities of the dish.  The mushroom soup was so delicious, with six types of wild mushrooms, including white shimeji, brown shimeji, maitake and king trumpets. Every bite was a mouth full of mushrooms, which I loved, and this was a thick, hearty soup I would definitely recommend.  The new cocktails (all $12) that accompanied the meals were also delicious. My friend and I loved the Makers Mark Manhattan, with Makers Mark whisky and sweet vermouth and garnished with a Luxardo cherry. It was strong and sweet and had a great holiday spice.  The Ketel One Moscow Mule is also always a great choice, as is the Meyer Lemon Drop, made with house-infused Meyer lemon vodka.  We had to try the delicious new Apple Cinnamon Crisp ($10), which came topped with vanilla ice cream that made every warm bite a perfect holiday dessert.  Other new menu items include Linguine and Shrimp ($23) and Blackened Pacific Redfish ($21 for dinner).  Paul Martin's will have a holiday menu through January 3, as well, including Chilled Alaskan King Crab Legs ($25), Grilled Lamb Sirloin and Herb Crusted Filet Mignon ($39)."}
{"text":"There's nothing not to love about Paul Martins. The food is unbelievable. You can Taste the quality of the fresh produce and high quality meat that they serve, they deff don't scrimp on any ingredients. The customers service is always consistent and outstanding. And their specials that they have are such a great deal, seriously can't beat PM. I have been here for both dinner and brunch and its exceptional, my favorite place to eat in the Valley."}
{"text":"If every restaurant could take a lesson from Paul Martin's on how to perfect the quality of food and customer service, bad Yelp reviews wouldn't exist. I am writing this review on a full stomach of delicious cuisine, but it was more than just good food. It was the excellent experience in general.   First off, they accept reservations which is a huge plus during the busy season. We made a reservation and upon arrival, we were seated right away. From the moment we sat down until the moment we left, it was a pleasant experience. Our waiter Jeremy is 50% responsible for the great experience. He greeted us as if we were personal VIP guests of Paul Martin's American Grill (which we were not, just random customers). He was incredibly knowledgeable and educated us on the brand, food and history of Paul Martin's. I had no idea this restaurant is a concept of and owned by Mr. Fleming of Fleming's Steakhouse. All of their food is made in-house from scratch and much of it is sourced locally form Arizona. I gained so much knowledge in such a short period of time, without ever feeling like I was being talked at. It was just friendly conversation by Jeremy who is truly passionate about Paul Martin's and it shows.   Jeremy pointed us in the right direction with everything we ordered and I'm glad we took his advice! We started with the calamari which is not your average rubbery calamari. No, this is cod calamari and it seriously puts any other calamari to shame. The seasonings and freshness of the dish made it taste so good I didn't want the dish to end. We almost didn't get it at first because we figured it would just be like every other calamari we had, but we were definitely wrong.   For dinner, I had the short ribs and mashed potatoes, thanks to Jeremy's suggestion. The meat was tender, juicy and flavorful with each and every bite. The mashed potatoes were just as amazing as the short ribs themselves. For dessert, I gobbled up several bites of the pear and huckleberry cobbler which was delectable to the core and topped with their homemade ice cream.   Between the combination of excellent service from Jeremy and delicious food from Paul Martin's, I'd say this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in awhile. I just wish we had given this restaurant a try much earlier! Now we will definitely find our way back again soon.   PS   - They offer brunch on the weekend for just $14 for a pre-fixe menu. I can't wait to try it!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is amazing. Selections for all budgets. Try the $6 lemon drop, it was my favorite. All the food we ordered multiple apps, entres, desserts, drink, etc were everything and beyond what we hoped for. All the staff were very helpful and checked on our table multiple times throughout the night. Will definitely return on every trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for dinner after my customer event and sat at the bar for dinner.  place was lively and inviting and service was good at the bar.  I started with a Manhattan that was made very well, and then had the steak cobb salad which was excellent and reasonably priced for the quality and quantity.   definitely would recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great haPpy hour prices, and the oysters were heavenly. We had chicken wings and ribs. Generous pour on the wine and delicious beer. Hannah was a friendly, attentive server. Dessert was a delicious chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Family dinner. Shared Fried Calamari: very good. But salt & pepper shrimps were really good. I had Brick Chicken: very very good. My son had Braised rib and my  wife Chumicurri Chicken. Dinner was great."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional,  and everyone in the restaurant was very friendly.  I had the Cedar Plank Steelhead and grilled cauliflower,  which I highly recommend. The calamari was cooked perfect,  but the sauces were a bit spicy."}
{"text":"This place is Good for a light dinner and cocktails,  They do NOT have a kids menu but a few good options for the little ones are the Mac N Cheese my 7yr old son rated it a 6-7 the cheese burger is a good option as well.  I ordered a few oysters $3 each so why not right they were D lish !  my son had a Shirley temple which he did not care for I guess they make their own grenadine in house but he wasn't impressed and honestly neither was I, it was sour not sweet had an orange flavor rather than a cherry flavor.    We ordered a Cheese burger with side salad, OMG the Ranch is the Bomb.com!! they make it fresh daily.  I'm a huge ranch fan!   I'll give it a 9   it was plenty of food for one adult and child we will totally be back he did feel like a big boy because they didn't have crayons so if you have small kids be prepared to keep them entertained"}
{"text":"So impressed! We live right down the street and first time we've been in. The food was impressive. So glad to find a restaurant that does not serve bland blah food. We will be back. Try the grilled salmon and cauliflower on the side:) Server Stephen was great."}
{"text":"Second time at this place. Really like the atmosphere here. Laid back. Contemporary design. Spread out. Beautiful outdoor patio and bar. You never feel rushed in this place. A good representation of AZ cool.   Food is equally excellent. Wonderful beef here for the price. Blackened rib eye steak was tender, juicy Med rare with nice blackened spice on it. A dab of steak butter on top was like frosting!.   Artichoke appetizer was overpriced kinda tough and not worth it. Generous pours on wine but a little on the overpriced side. I can't see spending $17 for a glass of wine. Just doesn't make sense to me. Lower your prices guys. Companion had skirt steak and it was equally very good.   Earlier visit I had brick chicken and was great too. Mashed potatoes are spot on.   A very good restaurant that delivers pretty well.   Bandera down the road is very much like this restaurant but it surpasses on all levels. Just smaller in size."}
{"text":"We saw pretty good reviews here and decided to check it out. We had no idea it was chain. Pretty good steak chain. I would give it more like 3.7 instead of 4 stars.   We had a reservation and we were seated right away with the friendly host. And our server was very nice and polite, with the usual upsale pitch on wine and specials.   My short rib was absolutely delicious and something I would order again. The mash potatoes were pretty good too. My friends hangar steak was also delicious.   We did have an issue with my buddy's steak in which it had to be remade. Seemed to be well done and dry when we asked for it medium. We usually end up eating stuff even if we don't like it too much, but since we're spending $50 or so on a steak, it had to be perfect. Even when it came out the second time, it still wasn't cooked properly and seemed sort of rushed. It really killed the dining experience. And even if the manager and the server brought out a third steak, it would have been too late.   I give 4 stars because the manager and server handled the situation pretty well. They tried their best and it seems to be a fault in the kitchen side.   Would I come back? Yes, great ambience and service. Food was good, aside from my friends steak."}
{"text":"We visited Paul Martin's for dinner on Friday night.  The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice; the food pretty good but on the expensive site.  The service, however, was terrible.  While our waiter was nice, we had to wait painfully for him to take our drink order followed by a painfully long wait to receive our drinks followed by a painfully long wait for our appetizers followed by a painfully long wait for salads followed by a painfully long wait for entrees and dessert.  A lot of staff attention was focused on those in the bar nursing a drink for two hours and splitting an appetizer among many.  In short, the food was good but not exceptional; fairly expensive and the service terrible.  With all the other great alternatives in Scottsdale, I don't know that we will be back."}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars not for service or food that was all great. We had a group of 5 girls an we choose a different restaurant every month to try something new an get together. We look for great happy hour which they had, except not when you are eating in the dining room. Our waitress was kind enough to ask the manager if we could take part, they kindly said yes. We also look for pricing, yelp states it $$, which is what we look for as well but clearly it should of been $$$-$$$$ range. The food an our server Hannah B were awesome!"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this at the Borgata shopping mall and were glad we did.  Although they were crowded, we were able to be seated shortly.  They have indoor and outdoor seating but due to the wind we sat inside.   It had a nice vibe and the hostess was very friendly and helpful-even returned to the table to answer a question we had.  My friend had the mushroom soup and loved it.  I had the skirt steak which was very good.  It was tender and tasty and came with some arugula and sliced sweet potatoes..  The service was great and it was a good meal.  I'd definitely go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Fabulous service, delicious food. I can't rave enough about their chocolate cake with cherries. YUM"}
{"text":"Divine! Excellent service, attitude and food! Reminds me of houston's service and attention to detail wise. The kale caesar is yummy! Calamari is piping hot, artichoke is delish. Short rib is ammmmmazing. The grilled polenta sooo gooood, added prawns to it, they were perfectly cooked and went well with the dish. Will be back! Again excellent, very cordial service."}
{"text":"Booked in to eat here with my family while we visited town. There was a long wait - at least 20 minutes - for our table to be ready despite the reservation.  A few of his headed to the bar, where we had friendly service, though there was some confusion as a manager asked for my order after we'd already spoken to another barman.   After being seated, we ordered another round of drinks and some appetizers. The appetizers the best part: the shrimp cocktail came with large prawns and the dipping sauce was spicy and delicious. The French onion soup was also good and cheesy.  The entrées were disappointing. My medium-rare filet came out medium and wasn't very flavorful at all. All the sides were over-egged: the spinach was so coated in garlic that it tasted like raw garlic (I love garlic but found it unpalatable). The Brussels sprouts were shaved rather than halved, which was an odd presentation, and so coated in bacon and bacon fat that the whole dish tasted like bacon - again, unpleasantly so.  Our server was pleasant but inefficient, he would visit the table and ask one or two people if they needed anything, then another two people would shout a request after him as he left the table, then it'd take him awhile to circle back. At one point, as the restaurant was thinning out, I waited 15 minutes for a glass of wine. He stopped by and said it was on its way when I was about to ask, so I can't tell if the order hadn't been placed when I asked or if the bar took a long time, but most of our drinks came much more quickly when the restaurant was busier.  The decor and atmosphere are nice, and they made a little extra effort with a dessert for my birthday. Not all bad, but the entrées and style of service really let this place down for me."}
{"text":"Their happy hour runs fro 3-8 and for $13 you can get a burger, craft beer and fries.  The beer I had last time was a Sonoran Victorian IPA from a local Phoenix brewery.  It was very good and paired well with the burger and fries.  The fries were crispy and some of the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Great tasty food and wonderful service. We really enjoyed the outdoor seating and the gluten free options. Happy hour is from 3-8 and the food and drink menu is great for sharing and having a laid back fun time."}
{"text":"We are from Wisconsin so this was our first time eating at a Paul Martin's and it was amazing! Everything we ordered was very delicious and the service was top notch. Our waiter, Cortney, was so personable and made our dinning experience one we will always remember. Thank you Cortney for a great birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Day is crazy in most restaurants.  And that could have been the case at Paul Martin's.  However, staff was ready.  The crowd was there.    Our party of 2 arrived a bit early.  We requested a booth.  They accommodated us with no problem.  We were seated shortly before our reservation time of 6:00 p.m., despite the special request.  Trent, our server, was charming, witty, and offered us excellent suggestions.  We had mushroom soup, chicken chimichurri, and salmon.  The food was delicious.  Especially the mushroom soup.  The staff worked like a professional dance company, each person playing off of and helping the others.  When one person noticed that a table needed something, they didn't wait for the 'right' person to do it.  They all lent a hand.  My friend and I observed this throughout our meal.  Our booth was right next to the kitchen.  We had a great time looking over the wall, witnessing first hand the ease and professionalism with which the kitchen executed each meal.  The servers lined up like soldiers, ready to get their plates to the tables.   The manager stopped by our table just before we left.  We offered our thanks and congratulations for such a great experience.    My friend and I will definitely recommend Paul Martin's to our friends.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of previewing Paul Martin's for lunch last week, before their official opening to the public...  I met my friend Gelie and we had a pleasant, leisurely, and filling experience.  As to be expected with any new restaurant, it seems that the hostess / front area is still working on greeting, seating, confirming reservations, etc... but the great thing is that PMAG seems to have a ton of staff, so I'm hoping they will all \"get it\" in due time.  Between Gelie and I, we tried the Chicken Tortilla Soup, the Kale Caesar salad, the Fish Tacos, the Mushroom Burger, and the Banana Cream Pie.  Nothing we had was to die for, but it was all tasty.  The service was attentive, ambiance comfortable, and I was pleased to see that despite being a chain (there are currently six California locations), they keep it local by using seasonal products from Valley farmers and purveyors including Black Mesa Ranch, Crow's Dairy Farm, Schreiner's, Hayden Mills, Queen Creek Olive Mill, and more... Their menu isn't overwhelming, but there's a decent amount to choose from.    When I return, I hope to try the artichoke appetizer and perhaps the Greek Salad with prawns and/or the Bistro Burger.  (Gelie and I actually missed that the Three Mushroom Burger we ordered was a mushroom patty and not a beef patty!)  We ate it anyways; who doesn't need more veggies?!  Paul Martin's took over the location where J Alexander's used to be... I hope they stick around for awhile!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today with a friend. This could be a great date place.  It has a lovely interior and the outside patio looks like a great place for a date.  We both had the Grilled Salmon. I like mine cooked well and often that means dry and overcooked. It's tough not to over do. But Paul Martin got it just right. It was cooked all the way through and still moist. I thought the portion was large - especially for lunch. The bread didn't win any points. It was kind of a slab of bread and easily skipped (helps the diet plan!). We ended with their Banana Cream PIe and coffee. The Banana Cream pie had a thin layer of chocolate. It didn't overwhelm the bananas. Banana Cream pie can be a heavy dessert. This was light and didn't overwhelm the senses. The coffee was great. Everyone who worked there, were pleasant, polite and had great smiles. They certainly gave the feeling that we were welcomed.   The only things that slightly f took away from the experience. We were at a booth right next to the kitchen. There's a whole row of booths that are parallel to the kitchen. There was a lot of noise before the restaurant was half full. We sat at the outside edge of the booth to hear over the noise. Odd for a place like this.  And the service was great once they discovered us. I sat for over 10 minutes without being acknowledged by a waiter or asking if I wanted a drink while I waited for my friend. My friend arrived and it was almost another 10 minutes before we were noticed. The waiter made up for it - service was amazing after that. Just odd because the restaurant wasn't that busy and many waiters went by but no one seemed to take notice. Very minor point and certainly the waiter gave fantastic service after that."}
{"text":"Restaurant is located where J. Alexander's was and decided to eat there because of a $25 off coupon in the mail.   Made reservations for 3 on a Friday night without any trouble via Open Table. Inside and out, the only difference between the current decor and that from J. Alexander's is the name on the door! Seems like exact same store.  Food was good. No one had any complaints but wasn't blown away either. I had a rib eye and spinach for $36. Wasn't especially good, and was too salty but it wasn't tough and was prepped as I asked.   Overall I feel like this is another restaurant typically found in Scottsdale; a little over priced not great food served in a nice atmosphere. I suppose I'd eat here again but if I had to choose between this place and Roaring Fork, RF would win every time."}
{"text":"Decor was nice. Staff was professional. Food was delicious. Great for a date night. I would say it's a step up from casual dining and the pricing reflects that as well. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! We will be back. Small bites and the setting was really nice. Located around many other restaurants this one is for sure one to stop by."}
{"text":"My visit to Paul Martin was like going on a roller coaster ride. At the start, my expectations were high (good service and management) based on what I've heard from prior customers. At the peak of the \"ride\" (the prime rib), it was enjoyable. The prime rib was cooked perfectly at medium-rare and seasoned well. Near the end, I was disarmed by poor service (incompetent and rude waiter) and gross ice cream (specifically the gingerbread and chocolate flavors. I couldn't eat it.) -- to the point where I just wanted to get out of there or risk vomiting from disappointment and annoyance.   4 stars for prime rib/salad and management downgraded to 2 stars for service and non-lactose free dessert."}
{"text":"Sooooo after loving the Paul Martins in Irvine we thought this would be as good as the others. We went weekly. Unfortunately we were sooo disappointed. Unlike the Hillstone Group which are all great this particular restaurant was a huge let down. Yes, the ambiance is great & we had good service. BUT the food .... we went with another couple on a sat night & ordered filets. They were tasteless . Period. End of story. One person ordered the skirt steak which was chewy. Very. Even the hot fudge sundaes were bad. On par with Dairy Queen.  $200 later per couple I don't think we will return. Bandera here we come ..."}
{"text":"Really great food, and really great service. (thanks Victoria)   We had a variety of main dishes and entrée salads.  All were very good.  My husband loved the Beef and Bacon tacos... Another Chicken and Quinoa dish was amazing.  Dessert... oh lord.  While the waitress recommended the apple tart.. we opted for the Chocolate Cake.. which was incredible.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Dropped by here on a Friday night with my wife hoping for a good dinner but all we got was marginally decent food that was very pricey.  Cocktails were 10 dollars each, not bad, but didn't really taste too good. nothing special.  Servers were unpolished. Felt like they were all newly hired.  Food was not that good. New York Strip Steak was a small portion. Tasted all right, but not nearly enough for a young man. Asked for medium rare but got it medium. Wife ordered medium sandwich but got rare. Had to send it back (after waiting for 10 minutes).   Overall, came out to 40 a pop, but was a lackluster meal."}
{"text":"Horrible food good service waiter was attentive. Spinach cheese was ok at best more spinach then cheese bread was burnt , kids burger ok the bun tasted weird, baby lettuce salad horrible pecans not much more salad dressing hardly , not good at all side order of Mac and cheese had a weird taste paid $88 not worth the money"}
{"text":"Have to say, we hadn't been for about a year and always thought it was just OK and a good alternative to Houston's when faced with a 2 hour wait BUT, this is no longer just OK...it has turned into a great spot!  Good was exceptional as was the service (which I must say was always exceptional).  The short ribs, Salmon with quinoa and Meyer lemon, mushroom soup and Caesar Salad, all to die for!  I also appreciate the ability to order an exceptional wine by the glass and their options are that!  Atmosphere is stunning, warm and inviting."}
{"text":"We've gone to this restaurant twice before and decided to go back for my wife's birthday.  The salad had way too much dressing on it that no one ate it.  My wife and her father ordered the salmon that also came with sweet potatoes.  There was so much sauce on the potatoes that it ran into the salmon. It ruined it.  It's sad to say that the bread, and beverages were the best part of the meal.  We won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday last year and I had such a wonderful time! It was a little hard to hear but the service was friendly. ZERO complaints about the food, all was delicious. Price point is definitely higher than what I would've liked. Overall, great experience and amazing menu!"}
{"text":"Been to Paul's a couple of times now. The service is great, all smiles and helpful. The atmosphere is pleasant.  The food in general is mediocre. Last night had the fried chicken and it was boring and a bit dry. Nice salad, had the vegetable spring roll and unfortunately they had just came out of the refrigerator and they were way to cold. Once we let them \"thaw\" out they were very tasty. Like I said mediocre"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and sat on on the patio. Great salad options and a few $12. 00 lunch options. Great atmosphere and service. They have a very popular happy hour from 3:00-7:00pm and a couple nights of price fixed dinners like prime rib on Sunday and fried chicken dinner on Monday. They have Meyer lemons trees that line the patio and they are used in there cocktails."}
{"text":"Time for me to update my previous review.  Yes we had a horrible experience last year at Paul Martin's, the general manager did contact me and comp'd a meal for me and a guest. That experience was great, but then again there were ready and on guard for us.   We returned last Saturday without prior notice. After arriving early, we sat at the bar for cocktails while waiting for our table to be ready. Drinks were great, the bartender engaging, servers were fantastic and stopping by to say hello as we waited. Once our table was ready we headed off to dinner. Our server, Heather English was amazing! We ordered appetizers and additional drinks. While waiting for those fresh bread was brought to the table and The manager stop by to say hello to see if our experience was going well. Yes dinner was spectacular!  But, the service was attentive without her hovering or ever making us feel like we were just 'another' table.  Wonderful experience.   In closing, I highly recommend Paul Martin's as it seems as though the bugs have all been worked out...!  In fact, I'm heading there next Tuesday for lunch with colleagues."}
{"text":"their happy hour deal with burger and a beer is awesome! one of the best tasting and juicy buergers I've ever had and great price. All my firends in my group agreed! Also, nice atmosphere, classy. You just have to get there in time to find a place at the bar area to get happy hour price deals"}
{"text":"MEDIOCRATY PERFORMED WITH AVERAGE PRECISION  After reading multiple reviews and hearing the buzz about Monday happy hours, this was the destination for a night out with the wife and good friends.  My wife and I arrived a good 20minutes early but our reserved table was free so the hostess sat us at the table instead of the bar.  We sat at the table a solid ten minutes before our server showed to offer a drink and app.  We figured that this delay was attributable to four menus/place settings but only two people.  At this point we informed the waiter that we intended to run a decent bar bill and take Uber home.  It was disappointing that the waiter did not really demonstrate any mastery of the wine list or even beers available so rather than trying new things we settled for standards and ordered the artichoke appetizer.  Drinks were prompt and our guests arrived as the appetizer showed.  The artichoke was flavorful with good grill char and nicely subtle mayo-based sauce.  But, the waiter forgot to take our guests' drink order.  I wanted to wash the oil from the artichoke off my hands so I got up and then tracked the waiter to order the women a bottle of wine and the men another round of porters.  When I returned the waiter was at the table with the vintner but wrong grape.  I had ordered a Chardonnay but he presented us a Pinot Noir.  At least he didn't open the bottle ahead of presenting it.  I wrote everything above as a draft over a month ago.  After seeing that I never completed it, I was faced with a choice to try and recall or delete.  I thought I would be true to the intent so I looked up the menu to refresh my memory of the meal.  That didn't work...which speaks to the so-so nature of the whole experience."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere, as well as a decent drink menu.  But, the food was awful!!!The table bread was obviously recently removed from the freezer, and the balsamic vinegar had turned sour. The French dip from any Arby's is a masterpiece compared to their $19 cold,tiny,boring sandwich.  The macaroni and cheese... Save your money."}
{"text":"Very nice place, friendly staff, and delicious food. The only criticism is we went in for happy hour but the seating is at the bar or communal style and we wanted a table in the bar area. \"No happy hour if you want to sit there\". So the difference is??? But this is a small knock on the place and we will definitely go back. BTW...I had the Bistro burger and it was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food.  A bit expensive but a solid meal. Butternut soup, kale Cesar & Brick chicken were all tasty.  We ordered the steak on the Cobb to be cooked medium well and it came out rare!..."}
{"text":"MONDAY NIGHTS  $50 - Bottle of Wine, 2 Spring Salads and 2 Entrees of choice.    Are you kidding this is the best deal it town!!!  I have been here twice now for this deal.  First visit we ordered the Annabella Pinot Noir - Great Food wine - a little more bold than typical PN's. My friend ordered the linguine and shrimp and I the hanger Steak.  We split each dish and they were a great compliment. The pasta is great with the garlic and spinach (add a squeeze of lemon and you are golden) and the steak was cooked to perfection.  Who doesnt love steak and mashed potatoes though.  Second visit we ordered the Annabella again because its just so good!  This time I had the Seared Tuna and my dad had the Cedar Plank Steelhead. These are two of my all time favorite dishes! Tuna had the best sear and the crust flavoring pairs so well with the pickled onions and arugula salad with white beans.  I legit licked my plate... not one of my finer moments. My dads salmon was killer in the mushroom jus - they do an excellent job of pairing foods and flavors with one another.    Oh also came here for happy hour (3PM-7PM everyday!) and sat at the bar, great vibe cool bartenders.  Had some Rose with the prosciutto crostini, smoked salmon flat bread, and smoked chicken and wings.  Love it all!! Great spot for a meeting too!"}
{"text":"Was given a gift card so had a reason to check this place out. Don't think I would have known about it otherwise. Wanted to go for happy hour, made a reservation since it was Friday & wanted to guarantee a table.   Once we were seated in the empty dining room & I inquired about happy hour, I was informed it restricted to the bar area only. The bar area was packed & happy hour is restricted only to two picnic style tables & four high-tops on the right side of the restaurant. I really couldn't believe there were real estate restrictions! My boyfriend & I decided to sit next to each other instead of trying to awkwardly yelp across the large table (seriously, you feel like you're at kings of the knight table).   Our waiter from the dining side was amazing & super nice, but unfortunately we had to switch once we moved over to the bar. The service in the bar wasn't as great & it literally look about ten minutes to get drinks, but the margarita was really good!  As far as the food goes, I ordered the calamari because it caught my eye when they handed me the dinner menu. So that one was full price, but it was worth it because it was definitely ten times better than the salon street tacos I ordered. The sauce they use on them was so salty it was making me gag. To make it even worse, the lemon that comes with it was coated in salt. My boyfriend ordered the burger + beer + fries deal for $15 (which is pretty sweet since it's any craft beer). He said the burger was delicious.   I don't plan on going back to this place, solely based on the restricted happy hour. Their dinner menu otherwise is overpriced."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Decent wine list. Staff was awesome and we never had to ask for refills."}
{"text":"I'm really shocked and suprised at the reviews.  Yes, great atmosphere and great service, but the food is ok considering the price.  I would rate this an overpriced resteraunt wuth good food, but on the bland side.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I had a much better experience the 2nd time so am upping the rating! Most everything was spot on from the service to the food. Don't miss the Grilled Artichoke and Salt and Pepper Shrimp appetizers. Both were great! The Mesquite grilled salmon was far better than the wood plank salmon entree I had the 1st time. Pan-seared cauliflower side dish was also very tasty."}
{"text":"I am not sure how to rate food I did not eat! I came in on Sunday to celebrate my anniversary. We specifically chose this place for the prime rib, unfortunately they did not have it despite offering this dish as their feature choice. We were offered an alternative for a significantly higher price. But it was not the price hike that we felt offended by, it was the condescending nature of the manager, we felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed that we even asked for a price match. This reason alone is why we thanked the server and left. I can handle bad food, but bad service is unacceptable.  I want to add the we went across the street to Fleming's and they did not have prime rib either, but they immediately offered an alternative with sides for the same price! We never asked, they offered it to us. They gave us the desert when we mentioned it was our anniversary and the server and the manager gave us a $50.00 gift card and a gift wrapped box full of chocolates!  Simply Amazing!"}
{"text":"If I was only rating based on the filet I ordered this would be a 4++; so tender, so perfectly cooked; so yummy.    Unfortunately my husband also ordered the cedar plank salmon which drew down the rating considerably; the presentation on the creamed spinach was a miss...the same very bitter creamed spinach that was served with my dish...it was inedible.  And the mashed potatoes were fine but just sort of uninspiring....the best you can do for a starch side dish is mashed potatoes with some butter?    I do like that they still serve bread with dinner.  The apple crumble was nice to finish with.  Re value....it's a mid range restaurant ambience wise, but price wise it's beyond the mid range experience.   It would be a good choice for happy hour however."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful restaurant lots of parking Front desk is outstanding Tables and decorations top notch Menu has a great selection Bar is full the selection is great Bartenders great and friendly Waiter very knowledgeable and friendly Great selection of wine decent prices Price were consistent with other. Nice restaurants Why not a 5 star  Dear Chef  Please were in 2015 Salt is not the only seasoning."}
{"text":"Dissatisfied- I heard so much about this restaurant I decided  to bring my family to celebrate my wife's birthday. The food did  not disappoint, however the service was less than good. The moment we sat down our waiter rushed us. We eventually order cocktails and our Meals. Everyone in our group of 9 ordered a salad or soup. My wife and daughter had only finished 1/4 if their soup and the waiter brought out our meals.  Embarrassed my family asked if they could have to go containers for their soups.  Someone did mention they were sorry for bringing out everything so quick and then walked away. We ordered two bottles of wine and didn't even have a chance to finish them with our dinner.  Enjoy our food even though we were rushed till the very end. Service was about a bad as I have ever experienced.  No need to return"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night with another couple to celebrate my boyfriends birthday & we had a great time. Had 730PM reservations & were seated right away. My girlfriend and I split a bottle of wine -- Argentina Malbec, really good. And our boyfriends got beer. I was interested in the Pacific Redfish on the menu but was bummed when they were out of it so I settled for Mesquite Salmon -- it was great! My boyfriend got short ribs which were delicious too. We also split a side of the mac & cheese -- very good. We all had a great time here & would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Good ambience but other than that not good! The menu is rather basic and the food is certainly not worth the price! I had the bistro burger and it was completely devoid of any flavor at all. The menu makes it seem like it comes with cheese, no cheese is a $2 up charge. The other person I was with had the fish tacos-they were ok that was it. Once again not a lot of flavor. The same person had the mushroom soup and said it was actually pretty good. In summary, basic food with no flavor and a very high price tag."}
{"text":"Very impressive restaurant. The service staff are extremely attentive, the food is excellent. We love sitting at the bar for happy hour. Their burger, fries and a cold beer is only $13.00. The burger was done perfectly on a toasted sourdough bun. The sweet potato fries were hot and crisp. We continue to receive outstanding service and food at PM. Paul Martin's is always our go to Scottsdale restaurant."}
{"text":"The happy hour food was amazing! Great atmosphere and very nice service. Was really busy though....call ahead!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great and the drinks are always on point! I've been here for the Father's day brunch and now we are here for the Mother's day brunch. It's a little on the pricey side but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Imad was our waiter very knowledgable of the menu. I had the cedar plank salmon and my boyfriend had the skirt steak both very good. Monday night special a bottle of wine two salads and any entree for 50$! So cheap. We also had the strawberry shortcake and banana cream pie super yum!!!"}
{"text":"I got to say I thought this place would be better.... great location, great service, but the food is average. We ate with other 5 people and everyone left feeling the same way. Everyone said the same thing.... \"I thought it would be better\"."}
{"text":"What a beautiful experience!!! Amy G. took great care of us. Impeccable service Amy! She will take great care of you. The atmosphere is classy, warm and welcoming. The food was outstanding! It's so hard to get a burger that is actually medium like I like it and not medium-well. This one was perfectly done. We plan to come back really soon and will bring friends! Thank you from The Freemans..."}
{"text":"The food was pricey and the well drinks were ridiculously overpriced, thought for a minute I was in NYC! We had the prime rib medium rare. one came medium rare, one came medium. The waitstaff was the saving grace, they were very solititous."}
{"text":"This place has unexpectedly become one of my favorite if not favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.   I originally came here because it's close to my house and offers 1000 point tables on opentable.   I have since been back several times.  They have great specials Sunday through Wednesday.  Monday's they have a 3 course dinner for two and a bottle of wine for $49.  Tuesday's they offer a 3 course fried chicken dinner for $22.   Besides the fried chicken,  my favorite dish here is the brick chicken.   It's perfectly marinated with the perfect amount of herbs and spices.   Their menu is simple and delicious."}
{"text":"Our server Hannah was terrific!  We came to celebrate a graduation, and they treated us great.  The food was delicious and the atmosphere nice.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"It is my personal opinion that for about $100 for two is was a \"I won't be back\". The appetizer was skmpy. My main course was oily and the salad was truly pitiful. AND please stop asking if we want more to drink."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time with a friend a couple nights ago and Kathie was our server. She explained the menu and wine.  She gave us a couple of her favorite dishes and explained each of their preparations. My guest had the short ribs which were tender and full of flavor. I had the skirt steak and it was the best I've had. Kathie also recommended a wine to go with our dinner. We finished up with the pistachio ice cream. Everything was amazing and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Well..where can I start..we had reservations and it was our last night in Scottsdale. I had previously eaten here twice. Food is great. Our server, Amy,  was awesome but we originally came here for happy hour. However, the unfriendly and unapologetic manager, named Clyde said we could not have happy hour specials sitting at a table. Ridiculous!!! We all are still going to have dinner. We made the whole experience of a great meal flop. I will never eat at Paul Martins again because of their jerk of a manager Clyde!!!!! Sorry Paul Martin!!! Good food but a very unintelligent and inarticulate manager!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the bad reviews are! People in a cranky mood, who were at a different restaurant is the only explanation.   This place was so great for dinner. Definitely trying to give off a higher end vibe, which is fine, I appreciate great fine dining service! But they don't even have to go that fancy with the service, the food seriously speaks for itself and is wonderful. We had the spinach dip to start which was fantastic and the best I've had. It came with delicious slices of bread and sun dried tomato. Fiance had the short rib, a perfect portion size and delicious. I ordered the steak cobb with a side of mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was great, I wouldn't say I need it but it was definitely tasty. The salad on the other hand was so beautiful in presentation and I loved every bite. I didn't even use the blue cheese dressing they brought on the side. The vinaigrette it is tossed in is perfect.   Service could not have been better- our waters were never empty, servers were attentive while not being annoying or overbearing and the ambiance is quiet. You can get away with being both casual and dressy here.  I highly recommend Paul Martins for Lunch or Dinner. The servers are excellent and the food top notch."}
{"text":"I think they are still finding their footing, but the staff was all incredibly nice and accommodating, in sure if you alert them to any issues they will take care of you. I enjoyed my brief time here, for sure."}
{"text":"Our food was excellent (Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Butter Lettuce salad, Fresh Fish Tacos and a good wine selection). The three star rating is due to the service.  The service was extremely rushed. Three times before we were done with our plates various staff members (not our waiter) tried to remove our plates. We were just truing to enjoy our meal while also enjoying each others conversation. It appeared as if you did not have a fork in your hand and were not actively eating the staff was instructed to try to clear your plate. Due to the quality of the food we will try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place for delivery. Ordered a Beef Dip sandwich and it was great! Best au jus I've had in a while, very flavorful. Sandwich was good texture and not soggy. Fries were shoestring with potato skin still on it and lightly seasoned - perfect me for that's how I like them! Not too greasy. Food arrived well packaged with the fries and sandwich separate. I'd order from here again and I'll definitely visit the restaurant for a proper meal in the future."}
{"text":"Good restaurant and atmosphere.  We ordered the braised short ribs which were extremely tender and the chimichurri chicken which was full of flavor."}
{"text":"Great menu ! Great service ! Not your average restaurant. Makes you feel special. Great waiter but I'm sure tired of super young snobby hostesses who can't get a real job & are pissed this is it at age 18 ! Lol"}
{"text":"Excellent across the board. We had the prime rib special on our anniversary. Great service, great food, 5 stars all day long. Anyone rating this place differently is nuts. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Passing through from Houston to L.A., we chose this place and had no regrets. From start to finish and considering every aspect of a dining experience, this place ranks in the top 5 meals we've ever had.  Touché Paul Martin (Fleming), you've done it again."}
{"text":"Great experience  every time we go to Paul Martin's! Food is excellent, staff is friendly and attentive and atmosphere is  appealing."}
{"text":"We went a few weeks ago.  Everything was good.  Calamari was flavorful and cooked perfect.  I had the chicken under a brick and it was pretty stellar.  I'd go again for that.  Perfectly cooked.  The mahi my wife had was a great dish too.  Drinks were well poured and everything was reasonable in cost.  We'll go again"}
{"text":"Wow! It's my 4th visit and time to post! Great happy hour...and the Monday dinner for two is nuts! Great deal...great food...and impeccable service! Derek...Trent...and the manager on duty Eric....make me want this to be my weekly spot! That pork chop...yeeeeeeees! Seriously....if you have a palate for good food and wine....stop here! I'm a transplant...and have yet to have a bad experience......I would post pics.....post too late...I cleaned my plate and finished the wine!"}
{"text":"Went in for Happy Hour tonight on a \"blind date\" Paul our server was awesome! Food and drinks were great too!"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE- GREAT SERVICE- place has awesome atmosphere- happy hour specials are all very good!  bartenders fun and nice- will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Superb Service, Excellent food  Outstanding atmosphere. A Gem"}
{"text":"Probably the best happy hour in town. I had the smoked wings and tater tots (which are more like fried mashed potato balls) so who can go wrong with that?! My boyfriend had a burger/fries/beer combo for $13! The food was hot, fresh and delicious. The portions were very generous too and the ambiance is so inviting and romantic. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food, coffee and restaurant is very well put together. I would love to try this chain again. Sit out enjoy the sun, before you leave to go back to the freezing cold weather. Enjoyed everyone who work at this particular place. Very happy with my steak cob salad, but get it with some spinach mixed in it. Also the Mac n cheese is not your normal, it is fabulous. Coffee is organic and local, everything is fresh and bought from the USA and organic."}
{"text":"We had a phenomenal waitress, Kathie, she was very attentive and professional despite how busy the restaurant was.  Everything was exceptional! I had the Hanger Steak with Chimichurri and mashed potatoes, this is the first time I have ever had hanger steak cooked to perfection and juicy. Shocker! My husband had the Salmon fish tacos WOW! they were delicious, I'm not sure what kind of sauce they had but it was wonderful.  As if I hadn't already ate enough I got the Chocolate Cake with a double espresso, this was the BEST chocolate cake I've ever had. I would return just for the chocolate cake! The cake itself is moist and chocolatey without being too much and the FROSTING yummmm! So much for me not liking cake or chocolate much!?"}
{"text":"Lovely dinner. We often come here , we love the sustainability focus of this spot. Our server Trent was AMAZING!  He was super friendly & knew his stuff! He suggested the Ribeye with faro & It was oh so good with the sizzling butter and cooked to perfection! We also had salt & pepper shrimp, oysters and the pork ribs . Everything was delicious . We will definitely be back and are excited to check out their Sunday Brunch and HH which is 3-7pm .. DAILY!! Which is alright , alright alright in my book!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just had dinner here tonight and I have to say that it was great! To start off the restaurant is beautiful. The service was great! Their cocktails are amazing...if you like martini's you have to try their raspberry martini...it's delicious!!! And for all those chocolate lovers out there, like me, the Chocolate Devils Cake is phenomenal!!!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The manager was very attentive and most of all welcomed us as we were visiting for the first time experiencing a special occasion.   The Monday $50 special is amazing and not only is it a great deal, but they understand that because of the deal, they will attract new guests and work hard to make them return guests.   Love this spot and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Service and ambiance was wonderful. Live music good food. My only complaint is I think their wine is over priced. I went with the $12. Dollar glass and that was the low end. The waitress recommend the $25 glass but I passed. I recommend this place if you don't mind spending $ on wine and your not like me and order 3 glasses cheers"}
{"text":"We had reservations at 9:00  and got here by 8:50.Being Valentine's day they were fully booked but we were promptly seated.Service was friendly and fast.  We ordered Raspberry Martini (house vodka,lemon juice and sweet vermouth). Glenkinchie 12.  Salt and pepper shrimp (coated with a buttermilk batter) served with pesto aioli. Sweet potato fries. Chimichurri chicken (chicken breasts with wild mushrooms farro,spinach,onions).  I actually wanted the brick chicken with mashed potatoes but they were out of it for the day.The Chimichurri was well done and had a nice crispy skin.They served me fries instead of sweet potato fries so the manager recommended we snack on them and quickly got that fixed.The Raspberry martini tasted as good as it looked.The house Ciabatta wheat bread was fresh out of the oven.  Our server took some wonderful pictures.They also have a patio.Overall the experience was Great and we came home a Happy couple.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed this new restaurant.  The place has a good vibe and while we came with my mom for dinner, my husband and I would absolutely come back to just enjoy drinks at the bar.   We were seated right away and had great service from a well trained waitress who knew seemingly everything about both the drink and food menus.  Our meals were delicious and we all agreed we would be back."}
{"text":"This is our once or twice a week dinner place. Don't miss Monday night wine dinner special, 2 dinner entrees, 2 salads, bottle of wine $60! Happy hour is great and they fly in pacific nw salmon daily. Right now they have Dungeness crab! Food is fresh service attentive, just go you'll enjoy it"}
{"text":"One word...service!  I'm extremely impressed with their service here. Our server was attentive and my water was always filled. Only thing was he didn't refill our bread.  We ordered the cheese board, mussels, chicken parm., and the clam linguine. The mussels are tasty and spicy (be warn). The chicken parm. was decent but I would recommend ordering something else. My clam linguine was delicious. Perfect amount of clam to linguine ratio!! Now that's hard to find.   Overall, I would go back again. Just have to pick the right dish!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Really enjoyed the ribs, Mac and cheese, and burgers. Short ribs were fork tender and they even had grated horseradish available. And we got in without reservations!"}
{"text":"The Black Angus Steakhouse is way way way better than it. The New York strip steak which is the most expensive one is just about average, maybe even worse than the steak from Sizzler. The fish taco is OK, but I would prefer the one from Outback. Also the waiting time was unbearable long, we didn't made a reservation as the day we visited was Tuesday. I guess the only reason people would dine in there is that they can use the Amex spend 50+ get 25 back offer."}
{"text":"Very typical Scottsdale place, overpriced average food. The happy hour specials were really marginal except for the burger."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! It's beautiful, has a great patio, has amazing food, and amazing service. Why can't every restaurant have it together like this? I've never had a bad meal at this establishment or questionable service. The menu is varied enough to be interesting and everything is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile, pleasantly surprised and thrilled they're adding back some of the old menu items. My dining partner and I stopped coming because we were bored with the limited offerings after revamping the menu. We came for lunch, our server was very pleasant (slight spread thin as service was a bit long at times), atmosphere is always nice.  We ordered a Beer while looking over the menu. We ordered the Steak and Bacon Taco and the Fish Tacos (finally a different choice of fish, I chose the Redfish Tacos, do not like Salmon in general). The food came out hot and fresh and tasted very good.   We still like this place especially with the change-up of menu items. My only comment is they also up the prices of drinks, $8 for a Hopnosh IPA, really? Well then, maybe order just 1 at that price when normally we would have a few.  Still a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for work and decided to stay in nice Scottsdale instead of Downtown to avoid the commotion of Trump's rally in Phoenix.  The food was good.  The ribs were fall off the bone.  I didn't enjoy the slaw much.  I was able to sub the fries for cauliflower.   The service was very attentive.  Upscale restaurant gave me additional napkins for the ribs since it was a tablecloth and cloth napkins place.  An extra special touch was the warm napkin with a lemon instead of a wet nap."}
{"text":"Great restaurant service excellent! Best mushroom soup ever!!!! Clean professional with class!!!!! Try it worth it!"}
{"text":"The family visited Paul Fleming's owned Paul Martin's on Christmas Eve.  There was a little miscommunication with regards to the lady who calls those who have reservations as she told us they could make anything Gluten Free but when we arrived, both the waiter Trent who was great and the manager in the red shirt (who btw did not even know their was gluten in reg. pasta) said they were not able to make things GF.  So a little bummed I could only get a salad or soup and a app.  We started off with the artichoke app which is enough for two people which was real yummy much better than other places.  My friend had the pacific redfish and he said the spinach was amazing.  They did not offer anyone on our table bread or butter and I noticed everyone else had bread on their tables.  My other friend had the salmon salad.   I opted for the Butternut Squash Soup without the pesto on top as I can not have EVOO which their pesto was made with.  It was very thick and tasted like it had chili flakes in it.  Not a fan of the Butternut squash soup just average.  The best place to get the butternut squash soup is actually right across the street from Paul Martin's.  Overall my friends thought is was a bit expensive $15.00 for a glass of wine and $4.00 for a teabag /cup of hot tea.  The service was right on and Trent was amazing.  Three at the table - I only had an app and the soup, my friend had a salad and side of brussel soups which was sautéed in heavy EVOO with onions, then other entrée was the redfish and a trio of ice cream bill before tip was $106.00.  Little expensive and I came in hungry and left hungry not much on the menu if you are vegan GF.  They should have more GF vegan options.  I would come back just for the artichoke which was very yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We were seated immediately and Carl was our server. He was awesome! He checked with the chef on some preparation options for me made some stellar recommendation. He even talked us into dessert!  He was  friendly and personable without being intrusive. The food was great and everything came out perfectly. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are seeking some healthier options or just want some good food with a spin on traditional dishes."}
{"text":"Some things happen by chance but even chance happenings are meant to be. Since another restaurant was still getting over brunch in the late afternoon and other area spots are steakhouses, Paul Martin's was the obvious choice for lunch.  So go ahead Paul, make my day. In fact...I think you've made my life. I can't dine out the same anymore, at least not for the next couple of weeks. Let me keep the memory of our rendezvous fresh in mind. Our time together was well spent.   It's nice to see an upscale restaurant serve customers quality food and filling quantities at comparable prices. Everything was easy to eat and I didn't get tired of any one dish. Needless to say I stuffed myself and almost considered sneaking a couple bites off the carnivores.   This is what they ordered:  SALT & PEPPER SHRIMP starter (19.00) - eight large shrimp, lightly fried and served with green onion shavings and pesto aioli. This looked so yummy. The fry was golden brown and not greasy at all.    BBQ PORK RIBS kitchen classic dish (26.00) - fall off the bone rack of meat with sauce and sides of french fries and slaw. The ribs looked large and plentiful. I didn't see any fat or chewiness on them.  STEAK & BACON TACOS kitchen classic (17.00) - two tacos of mesquite grilled angus in corn tortillas with avocado cucumber salad. I was told the meat was filled with quality and flavor.  COLUMBIA RIVER STEELHEAD sandwich (14.00) - a filet of grilled salmon topped with arugula and pesto aioli between a soft roll with a side of thinly cut fries. No morsel was wasted.  PM has a concise menu. Only one dish was labeled vegan: a warm quinoa bowl with mushrooms, avocado, and veggies, but few options can be ordered vegan without the aioli or cheese. Vegetarians have pickins from each section except the kitchen classics.  I ordered:  SEASONAL SOUP starter (8.00) - small bowl of creamy butternut squash with a drizzle of olive oil and a couple of croutons. Best bowl of butternut I've had. Mild sweetness which I enhanced with a dash of ground pepper.   THREE MUSHROOM burger (14.00) - mushroom and cheese patty topped with arugula on a brioche-type roll dressed with pesto aioli and served with a side of sweet potato fries.    FIELD GREENS side salad (6.00) - generous portion of fresh crispy greens and slivers of cabbage, tomato, red onion, and sunflower seeds in vinaigrette.  PAN ROASTED CAULIFLOWER side (6.00) - roasted cauliflower florets and whole garlic cloves in oil and lemon juice. The addition of the citrus gave a delicious tang and cut through the oil nicely. The menu lists parmesan cheese as another ingredient to the dish, but thankfully I didn't taste any cheese. It was good without it.  It's unusual for me to finish everything on my plate(s), but it helped that saltiness and seasoning were perfect. The fries didn't even leave a greasy residue on my fingers or face. That's good cooking!   5 stars for Paul Martin. Good service. Good food."}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming one of my favorite Happy Hours (and in Scottsdale, that is saying a lot!) The food is fresh and mostly organic. The servers are friendly and helpful. The drinks are top shelf ie Tito's martinis and the soft seating on the patio is super comfy!"}
{"text":"I want so bad to give this place five stars. It has some really great things going for it. I've now eaten here twice: once for their happy hour and once for their $49 wine dinner. Now here's the good:  - service: both the bartender for the happy hour and our server at dinner were wonderful. No complaints.  - food: very good. Loved the salad the meal came with. Cedar plank salmon and poke were also good.  - price: amazing. You can't beat the $49 wine dinner.  Now the reason why I only give this place three stars:  - AC: my sister and I were both dripping sweat throughout our dinner. It was way too hot in the dining room. Even our server was like, \"PLEASE complain to the manager.\" She was obviously hot too.Unfortunately, no matter how good the food is, it's hard to enjoy while dripping sweat. The manager did come over and apologize and give us free scoops of ice cream, but we had just had a slice of pie, which brings me to...  - Banana Cream pie: I did not like it. The custard was super thin and tasted of artificial banana flavor like a banana runt. Do they add some kind of banana extract?? Ick. Also didn't love the whipped cream. Had a little fridgy flavor to it, like it had been sitting for a while. I really wish the manager had just comped the pie instead of giving us ice cream we were too full to eat because I felt slightly resentful about spending $10 on that not so great piece of pie. The fact that we shared it and left some on the plate says a lot. Neither of us enjoyed it very much.  - I do wish they had a better selection of beer and a salad on the happy hour menu, but that's not a big deal.  -Parking: parking is difficult and they basically force you to valet. It's free, but I still prefer to just self park.  Will I go back? Yes, I believe I will. The food and service really are good. I hope for a five star experience next time. And also air conditioning."}
{"text":"I visited for happy hour and the waiter forgot two things on our order and was slow. The food was ok on happy hour drinks were good. Then I visited for dinner and the food was average and overpriced."}
{"text":"Yummy again!  The grilled artichoke was a hit for me again.  My entree was a skirt steak with roasted sweet potatoes.  Others had the baked salmon, salmon tacos and the fried chicken.  All good. The only problem this time was service.  Our server did not cover the table well.  We waited a long time for dessert and wound up cancelling the order. Good food always, good service most of the time."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today. Always a comfortable environment.  What was really outstanding was our server, Courtney.  He was terrific.  Make sure you order the Mushroom Soup...it's a winner, as well as many other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I am a big (and I mean really, really, big) fan of Paul Martin's. My partner and crime Brian V. and I have gone to the El Segundo location for years and go to the new Rancho Cucamonga location at least once a week. That being said, we were looking forward to visiting the Scottsdale location while here on vacation. We dined here three times in 4 days, the first two being for happy hour and the last one for dinner. We had a great experience for the happy hours, and thought we had a great experience for dinner...until the food poisoning hit. Yes, Brian V., my partner in crime, had the seafood platter as his starter, and within 1 hour of finishing our meal (as we were shopping in the Scottsdale Fashion Square) the chills, sweat, and uncontrollable vomiting began.  I got him back to the hotel and promptly called the restaurant to alert them to the problem. Michael, the manager I spoke with was not very helpful, and clearly did not know how to handle the situation. He told me to check in with the other manager tomorrow morning...yeah, not helpful. As I write this at 11:20 pm poor Brian V. is very ill, vomiting and experiencing diarrhea. Thanks for ruining our vacation Scottsdale Paul Martin's."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and was not disappointed. Our server, Shannon, was extremely friendly and helpful. My husband and I shared the salmon lettuce cups, the cheese platter and macaroni and cheese. All were delicious and the portions were just enough to ride us over.   The mojito and cosmopolitans were perfectly made.   Cosy atmosphere. Overall, a really lovely place."}
{"text":"Our 1st time here.  Monday night $50 special (2 entrees, 2 house salads and a bottle of wine).  I had the brick chicken and my husband had the marinated pork chops.  Both were incredible!  My brick chicken was so tender and came with roasted garlic and really nice mashed potatoes.  It was so good I'd probably order the same thing next time around.  He said his pork chops were very good too!  If you go on a Monday, make reservations and use the valet to park (the parking lot was totally full).  All in all, it was an enjoyable dinner with excellent service."}
{"text":"Four and a half but for a corporate chain very impressed! Great grilled artichoke and organic greens followed by excellent salmon and king crab legs. Nice wine list, not super original but good and good kids meals with much appreciated fruit as well as fries. As a plus, the music was straight from my IPod, Vampire Weekend, Spoon, Bright Eyes etc. Manager checked on us and server was efficient and pleasant."}
{"text":"We had Easter dinner at Paul Martins this year for the first time. While the restaurant was clean and the service was fine, I thought the food was okay at best and grossly over-priced. Had to send back my wife's plate because it was under cooked, which is something I typically never do. I know that's not terrible but wanted better for Easter dinner.  I am not inclined to return."}
{"text":"What can I say?   Desserts is amazing.  Not too sweet.  . Housemade Eggnog was delicous.   Dustin was a great server.  :)"}
{"text":"Just had Mother's Day brunch, medium at best!  Server was fabulous but the food was bland and medium, will stick to dinner, if at all.  Thanks for trying!"}
{"text":"Great food, beer selection and happy hour.  Ask for   Steven at the bar.  He gave me excellent service.  The food and his knowledge along with a great personality made this a 10 out of 10 for me.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We visited this location over two years ago and boy what a difference. Service was extremely prompt and the staff was very hospitable. We ordered the Monday wine special and had the New York Strip and Braised Short Rib. The salads were just a filler. The field greens in this salad are way to earthy for my taste. The Prime New York Strip was so tender I used my fork to cut it. The short Rib was good but it  tasted reminiscent of a pot roast. The most notable change this visit was the service. Our server was very attentive and the support staff was a little overly aggressive while bussing our table. I was chewing my last bite, fork in hand  and someone appeared to take my plate. While I get it efficient service it seemed rushed more than efficient."}
{"text":"Absolutely top notch in my book,  While the regular menu surely is a little pricey, it delivers on the quality and taste.  A great cocktail & wine menu round it out.  As happy hours go, I really like the offerings. Not absolutely the cheapest HH prices, but really, you get what you pay for, and the HH offerings having me coming back for more.  Ambiance is casual elegant, and the service is always quite good."}
{"text":"Can't wait to return for a mushroom burger.  Usually restaurants will serve a vegetarian burger made with soy, beans, or grains, but Paul Martin stands out from the rest. The restaurant's Three Mushroom burger https://youtu.be/A93Np5gMzt0 is so good and hearty, I never want to eat another grain burger.   Get them grains outta my face!  PM's burger is a thick patty made of all 'shrooms and cheese. It's topped with arugula and aioli between a soft bun. Fantastic flavors. Order it with side salad, fries, or cole slaw (?).  Yum yum."}
{"text":"I went here only because of the reviews.  In fact, I was expecting to go somewhere else, but changed my reservation because of the reviews.  WOW, was I disappointed.  I thought the menu choices were not so great.  The food was very average.  The service was below par.  The table next to me, was discussing among themselves how poor their experience was; I wanted to join in their conversation.  I did not like my appetizer, I did not like my main course and I did not like the dessert."}
{"text":"I hate to say that I wasn't very impressed with this place.  We arrived for dinner on a week night and there were very few people dining. It took the waiter far longer than it should have to retrieve our drink order. The drinks remained empty without an offer for refills.  We shared the butcher's board - a selection of local cheeses and artisan salumes - it seemed subpar and overpriced.  Our dinner entrées were about the same. Nothing special.  For all the hype this place really didn't have the \"it\" factor for me."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times since my parents love the place and live close to it.  I can honestly say this is the best Happy Hour I have had in the Phoenix area and have been telling my friends to go check it out.  Where else can you get a small sirloin with a special sauce this delicious with shoestring fries (or garlic mashed potatoes if you ask) with a cocktail/wine/beer all for $13?  I have also had the dining room experience, and it was great, but the HH is just too good to pass up.  I tried the other things that my parents order on the HH menu and it's all very tasty and a great deal.  They insisted on giving me a free dessert for my birthday, that was three days away just because they are cool like that.  Go between 3 and 7pm any day in the bar and get blown away!"}
{"text":"This place is totally overrated. I feel like it is a Houston's wanna-be and it is unsuccessful in that effort. I've been here twice and the service has always been nice and helpful. But the food tho! The food is either under-cooked or over overcooked or oversalted or too sweet etc. Some of their items are actually even weird... We ordered spinach dip and were provided with a soupy cheese mixture with fresh spinach not even cut up floating in the soup. In other words, in order to eat the spinach dip you had to use a knife. Who needs a knife to eat spinach dip?  The taste was fine but it was weird. Other things I have had that I was not impressed with include the artichoke (if you want a real artichoke go to Houston's) and the cedar plank salmon (barely cooked). However, I ordered the short rib dinner the first time I was there and that was quite good. Besides that, everything has been somewhere between bad and meh."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood doing some shopping and popped in on a whim. The decor was elegant and the dimmed lighting along with big windows allowed for business meetings or casually formal luncheon. I ordered the fish tacos which were delicious but wish they would have come with a side. My husband ordered the burger which was on the small side for his liking. The fries on the side were a divine throwback to my grandma's homemade fries. All in all a nice place. Not kid friendly. Prices are high for lunch but considering the area, I guess it's normal."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Paul Martins and it did not disappoint! The salad was fresh and delicious. My husband and I both ordered the Halibut as per recommendation from our waitress and she was spot on. I think this was the best halibut I have ever had. It was very lightly blackened in a light cream sauce surrounded by asparagus and grilled cherry tomatoes. The tomato's were sweet as sugar! The fish was cooked perfectly. I especially liked that there was no starch on the plate. I could have ordered it separately if I wanted. The service was great and we loved the atmosphere, definitely a place that you can bring the family. Not stuffy at all. I must say we will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner. I ordered the brick chicken and my Mom got the braised short ribs. The portions were huge so we took it home. Our server was Angelo and he was fantastic. He answered all our questions and was so friendly and professional. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for a business dinner. It was an excellent choice. We started out with the artichoke appetizer which I never had before and was absolutely fantastic.   Our server, Amy L was great. She recommended an excellent red wine, the Educated Cabernet was delicious. I had the braised pork rib for dinner and this was so tender and juicy and succulent, it was a game changer!  No need for a knife at all. Finish things off with the banana cream pie for dessert."}
{"text":"Really good food. Went in for lunch on Monday for the wine dinner for two special. Good deal for the money. Regular prices are too high for how small the portions are in my opinion. I had to send my steak back due to being undercooked but everything else was fine. Server was very attentive and thorough. I'd recommend it but not unless you're going for a well priced deal."}
{"text":"(4.50 stars)  For the final dinner of our Arizona vacation we only had to venture across the street from our motel, the Scottsdale Hilton Resort.  I had enjoyed dinner at a Paul Martin's location in the Los Angeles area two years ago, and was anxious to dine here.  The physical layout of the Scottsdale property was sleek and modern, with heavy emphasis upon dimmed lighting, chrome and glass-- not at all unlike the LA location.  Michelle P. was our server on Tuesday, and she was personable, pleasant, knowledgeable and reasonably prompt-- a very good job.  We skipped the appetizers, soups and salads and went right for our entrees.  Our sons and I each ordered a different steak (skirt, hanger and New York strip), while my wife chose the grilled salmon.  Each was cooked to the requested temperature, tender, nicely seasoned and attractively plated.  A sautéed \"heirloom\" spinach accompanied my steak, as it had my salmon two years ago.  Then, as now, the particular variety was properly seasoned, but otherwise flavorless.  Unlike my prior encounter, the tough lower stems had been trimmed; tender and tasty, but not memorable.  The boys each enjoyed their steaks, and my wife, the salmon.  The four of us broke from our normal practice and ordered desserts; three for the table.  Chosen were the homemade ice cream sampler, banana cream pie and the chocolate layer cake.  Each selection was superb; neither overly sweet, nor lacking in comfort food value.  An excellent meal!"}
{"text":"It was really good, especially for the price. I'm used to paying 2-3x more for less quality. The food here is great and definitely a place I'd recommend. Great date spot, too!"}
{"text":"Honestly I didn't think it lived up to the hype. It was just a step below what houston's is. It's not bad by any means, I'd just rather eat at houston's for a better meal."}
{"text":"Have gone here 3 times and the third visit will be my last. Went for steaks, and didnt mind paying the almost $50 cost for them. I ordered medium well, which is supposed to be mostly cooked with a slight amount of pink. It arrived medium rare for both of ua, and they were both sent back. Mine came back charred and over done, so it got sent back again. My date finished her entire meal and drink before we asked where mine was. Several minutes later, it comes back butterflied, and well done, and smaller in size(like they had cut my old piece down, flipped it into two connected pieces and replated it without the char). Disgusting! I was embarrassed for the waiter and flabbergasted that they would treat a customer that way. Restaurants come and go in Scottsdale, and the ones that take pride in their work are the ones I frequent."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I have eaten here at least five times, and the food and service is always very consistent. They have a great artichoke appetizer to start - almost as good as Hillstone's legendary artichoke. The drinks are always poured as if they are doubles, so be careful if you're going to drive after having a cocktail. If you are taking Uber, or have a designated driver, than this is the place to have dinner and drinks.  Tonight I had the roasted chicken with mashed potatoes. Roasted garlic cloves are used as a garnish on the chicken, and it is served in a generous broth. The potatoes are very finely whipped and contain lots of butter - just the way I like them! I highly recommend that you eat here the next time you are in the Scottsdale and Lincoln area."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a month for their Sunday prime rib. It really is delicious! And we feel like we are stealing the price is so good! How can you beat $25 for a salad, a large piece of prime rib with mashed potatoes, and homemade ice cream? They also have a Monday night wine dinner (great deal!!) and a fried chicken Tuesday which I've heard is also very good!  The atmosphere is very nice-beautiful wood beamed high ceilings with fresh orchid arrangements and very comfy booths with dim lighting. The staff is top notch and the entrees are great.  we've had the chimichurri steak (yummy and garlicky!) the free range chicken-small portion but equally as tasty, the marinated skirt steak is cooked perfectly and very tender...the street tacos are pretty good as well if you want an appetizer. We are regulars here :)"}
{"text":"Amazing is al I have to say! My husband and I popped in for date night. Our server Steven was great! Food was out of this world. So much flavor!! Highly recommend the roasted cauliflower and grilled artichoke. Expensive...yes. But wonderfully prepared! Will totally come back!!!"}
{"text":"Our family of 6 went Sunday eve for the first time and it took them 15 mins to get our drink order to us. We ordered wine and beer!  We were not given water until after drinks arrived.  Our resv. was at 7 and at 830 we were still waiting for dinner to be served.  No explanation was given and it was not busy.  Service is SLOW.  Our waitress was very attentive and nice but that does not help with things being slow.  The St. Louis Ribs were partially very tender/part grisley.  The salmon was very good for 2 of us with the prawns being just ok, not much taste to the dish.  Banana cream pie was very good.  The decor is beautiful and upscale..............it's too bad the rest wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"Our server was friendly/polite and the food was great. If you drink scotch here, don't add ice or water. They don't filter the water/ice, and it tastes like crap. I ordered a Macallan with 3 ice cubes. Completely ruined the drink. Yeah, some people think you shouldn't add ice/water to scotch. Let me drink my drink the way I want to. Anyway, the ice was so gross, it ruined the $20 drink. Completely offensive and a waste of money. That's why you only get 3 stars."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale from Seattle on business.  Paul Martin's was near the hotel so my business colleague and I thought we would give the place a try.   Initial impression from the parking lot was that it may be out of our price range.   But we were pleasantly surprised by the food prices as well as the service.  I had the skirt stake which was outstanding.   And Mary, our server did an awesome job in taking care of us.   I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of a Fleming's steakhouse...it is actually the same founder I believe...fantastic happy hour and great service at the bar. It was surprisingly busy at the restaurant for a Tuesday evening...Apparently they have a great deal going on Monday evenings for dinner for two for $ 53 that includes two salads, two entrees, and one bottle of wine (any bottle with a square next to it). Atmosphere is chill and luxurious at the same time, highly recommended..."}
{"text":"Summary - terrific restaurant  Ambience:  great balance between fancy and casual. You can come dressed up or in jeans.   Bar:  Eric was great, and made a mean old fashioned. It's the mark of a good bar to me., but they have a wide variety of items. In addition, they have some decent happy hour options.   Food:  I had the organic green salad (with peanut sauce) and the hangar steak. To me, any restaurant that had hangar steak on the menu is on its way to a good review. I special ordered it blackened (like their ribeye), and it did not disappoint. It was cooked to taste (med rare), and the flavor was great.  For under $25, it was a great value.   Dessert included the ice cream trio - their mocha is legit - and the others hold their own.   Service was very good - I ate at the bar, and their service was on par with great restaurants.    If you're in Scottsdale, it's worth a visit.  Not 5 stars only because I don't typically give those out (not that I know anything). But I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Classy American Restaurant   Paul Martin serves solid food, but it's greatest strengths are its beautiful interior and excellent service. I'm from the South and a bit picky on fried chicken, but the fried chicken here was really good! The crust was crisp and substantial without being heavy, and the dish provides a nice combination of white and dark meat. The corn was also tasty, cooked Mexican style. The burger and salad were pretty standard but good. We were taken aback by the strawberry shortcake coming on a biscuit, but I'm sure it's good if you like bread/biscuits. The servers are top notch and very attentive. Overall a lovely experience!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last weekend and loved it!  The whole staff was very friendly and attentive, from the hostess, to the bartender, to our server, Hannah.  Everyone seemed to put hospitality at the forefront.  Their menu is full of enticing options, yet approachable; not too overwhelming.  My husband and I shared a grilled artichoke to start and I'm still thinking about it today.  It was that good.  Prepared perfectly and paired with a pesto aioli dipping sauce.  We both loved it.  Then we had the mushroom soup...I'm not huge on mushrooms, so I was hesitant to try it, but Hannah highly recommended it and I'm so glad she did.  It was so tasty!  Our entrees were awesome too; salmon and the ribeye.  I could honestly go on and on; we had such a positive experience and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We popped in on Saturday night around 8pm thinking we would have no trouble getting a seat in the heat of the summer but it was packed!  We sat at the bar, which was lovely and quite comfortable and enjoyed a great glass of wine and dinner.  We had not tried Paul Martins yet and we were not surprised at how good it was.   I had the salmon salad which I am afraid I will now be craving.  Clearly the fish was fresh.  My husband had the steak frites and it also was beautifully presented and delicious.  Service was friendly but professional.  Great atmosphere inside.  Not too noisy, but kind of a cool vibe.  Great food, of which the menu states is locally sourced as much as possible.  The happy hour menu looked fabulous with a smoked salmon that the couple sitting next to us raved about.  Lots of options price wise and a very nice menu for those watching their health as well as those wanting to splurge on delicious cuts of beef.  Wine list for the by the glass was excellent."}
{"text":"Ate here last night for the first time. Had a 7:30 reservation but the manager  let us know right away that he was just waiting for a table to clear out. Turned out to be longer than expected so he graciously set us up outside on a couch with drinks and appetizers. Not something you see much anymore. We sat down around 8::30. Our waiter was great and the manager made sure to check on us. My husband had the fish tacos and they were great! Drinks were always poured! We will be back in the future. Again, thanks to the restaurant for taking care of the longer wait."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic late lunch here.  Go for happy hour, 3-6pm.  The chicken sandwich is one of the best I've had.  My daughter enjoyed her burger.  The cucumber refresher cocktail is a perfect cool down on a hot afternoon."}
{"text":"The dining room is comfortable, decorative and modern. I had an enjoyable dinner. I ordered a field greens salad with tomato, red onion, avocado, cucumber, radish, sunflower seeds and house vinaigrette. I had Columbia River Steelhead Salmon with housemade lemon vinaigrette and chilled quinoa salad with arugula. Later, I ordered Toasted Almond Cake that had ladyfingers soaked in Amaretto, Italian Mascarpone, crushed amarettini cookie with chocolate chips. This was a light and refreshing meal with good service"}
{"text":"This place knows how to train their staff!  Outstanding wait service!  It was comparable to a 5 star restaurant!  The food was excellent and we were informed about the menu including they make everything from scratch using the freshest local ingredients, depending on what is available seasonally.  Really enjoyed this experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and ambience! My friend and I went for a late ladies lunch on a Tuesday ! Restaurant was not busy, which was nice and quiet!  Since it was so late in the day we opted to split a meal and a side. We ordered the fish tacos and cauliflower side. Dustin our server who has been with this restaurant since they opened three years ago -was excellent. Very friendly and terrific service! I've been here many times but my friend had not and she loved it too!"}
{"text":"We went on a Monday night and it was packed! The food was amazing! I had the Salmon with Brussels sprouts - yum. i loved it! and my friend had the braised ribs and those were delicious as well . loved it , cant wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"So my mom told me about this place and insisted we get happy hour together there, and when my mom likes a restaurant, it's kind of a big deal because she's pretty picky. My boyfriend and I met my parents there for happy hour the other week. It's wonderful that the HH goes until 8PM because my boyfriend works late so he was finally able to make it to a HH!   We got to sit out on the patio in the comfy cushioned chairs. I really need to remember to start writing down our servers' names because he was fantastic.   We ordered from the \"Taste of Paul Martin's Menu\" which is their way of saying Happy Hour. My boyfriend ordered the St. Louis Style Pork Ribs and I ordered the $13 special which comes with a burger (there's 3 choices available), fries (sweet potato, regular, or mixed), and a beer...all for $13!! The burger was very very yummy and incredibly juicy.   Not one of us left a scrap of food on our plates. I had a chance to check out their full menu and it looks like a place I definitely want to come back to and try out.   Happy hour = fantastic. Full dining experience = forthcoming."}
{"text":"I went to Paul Martin's on Sunday evening to try out their Sunday prime rib special based on the recommendation of some family members who enjoyed the prime rib on a prior visit. The Sunday special is only $25 and includes an organic green salad, prime rib with mashed potatoes, and homemade ice cream for dessert.  Green salad - surprisingly, I really enjoyed the salad. I thought the vinaigrette was delicious (it was a sweet/sour dressing) and enjoyed the mixture of greens.   Prime rib - Very large portion. I ordered my prime rib medium rare and thought it was cooked well. Although the edges of the prime rib were more medium/well-done than medium rare, there was a lot of meat and I was pretty full by the end of the entree. In fact, I had them box some to go. I would have preferred a little more seasoning, especially since it started to get a little bland by the time I finished half the prime rib. However, I think it's well worth the price and definitely filling.  Ice cream - There were three scoops of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, and their seasonal ginger bread. The ice cream was good (I enjoyed the vanilla the most), but again, there wasn't anything particularly \"wow\" factor about the dessert.  Service: This is where I had the biggest issue with my dinner at Paul Martin's. On multiple occasions we had to remind our waiter that one of our party had a food allergy and could not eat the dessert. Our waiter then misheard the type of food allergy we specified and we had to restate the allergy. Furthermore, we bought a gift card on that same day and were told by the waiter that he wasn't sure if we could use the gift card despite the fact that we had been told by the manager that we could. (I honestly have no idea why a restaurant would have problems with us using their gift card.) We then had to wait for the waiter to go check with the manager (who we had already talked to) and come back to inform us that, yes, of course we could use the gift card.   However, during the meal itself, the waiter did a good job checking in with us and asking about the food.  I'm giving this 3 stars because although I did not think the food was particularly mind-blowing, I thought it was a great deal for the price and very filling. As a side note, I have not had the opportunity to try other foods besides the prime rib special. I docked a star for the service."}
{"text":"Talk about a great place... The atmosphere is really nice.. They have a splendid outdoor patio for happy hour...  The happy hour menu is solid for food and drinks.. 5 buck mojitos...  We enjoyed dinner as well."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos and calamari with excellent service. But outrageous prices especially for beverages/wine.  If you go, stick with water."}
{"text":"Tried it because of the Amex deal ($25 back on $50).  Solid 3.  Good service.  Nice decor. Overpriced drinks that I guess were not on happy hour.  Like that the menu changes.  Too much butter on the fish and spinach!  To many places to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Best braised short ribs and wait staff anywhere! Joel and Courtney are the best! Amazing food and staff."}
{"text":"Ask and you shall receive!  We didn't have to ask for GREAT customer service today-but it was handed to us on a silver platter.  Paul was our delightful server-and he intuitively responded to our needs, whether we overtly stated them or not.  If I said I like lemons-we received a bowl of lemons for our drinks, when I had difficulty choosing between an Almond Cake or Chocolate Cake for dessert, and ultimately chose the Almond selection-Paul brought an additional bowl of chocolate sauce for the optional drizzle.  When we were leaving-he promptly delivered our two iced teas to go-to quench us in the climbing heat.  It was nice to be taken care of-without asking.  My hubby enjoyed the Bleu Cheese Burger, oozing cheesy goodness, served on a perfect bun and accompanied by crispy fries. I opted for the Grilled Shrimp Butter Lettuce Salad-a lighter fare to justify dessert later.  Both were delicious and satisfying to our individual tastebuds.  We will be back-and we will ask for Paul-easy to remember-maybe his last name is Martin!  Wink!"}
{"text":"I have never had a poor experience at Paul Martin's, the service is impeccable.  The manager both seated us and brought our wine.  The food is incredible, I haven't had a meal that was less than exceptional.  It functions as a well oiled machine.  Everything about Paul Martin's is superb, I ALWAYS look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Really oily food lacking the great seasonings to make up for it.  The calamari didn't have the light breading as advertised and was over-fried.  That's all I remember."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is really nice.  They have black and white photos of food hanging on the walls everywhere that really make you hungry!  I also like their private \"room\" in the back for larger parties.  I put room in quotations bc the table is separated from the rest of the dining area by thick curtains.  Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed with the entree I ordered: chimichurri steak with fries.  The steak was flavorless, or if it did have any flavor, it was overpowered by the STRONG charred flavor from the outside of the steak.  Basically, all I was tasting was something charred, with the texture of a steak on the inside.  And I ordered my steak medium rare so there was no reason for it to be so charred.  After a few bites I asked my friend if she liked the steak (she ordered the same thing as me) and she said it tasted fine, so maybe it was just me.  But she also likes her steaks well done with no pink inside at all.  Anyway, I didn't even finish half of it and just took the leftovers home to my dogs.  My dogs gave the food 5 stars!  But they also eat grass and sometimes their own poop, so that's not saying much.  On top of the overwhelming char flavor, the oil from the food (I'm assuming from the chimichurri sauce) was all over the plate.  It was too much oil!  and it was getting underneath the fries and making them soggy with oil.  Mergh, for $21 I expected more.  I did appreciate that they had regular parking, as well as a valet.  I hate places where you are forced to valet your car."}
{"text":"Came for soft opening night for family and friends. So far everything I have tried is excellent. Definitely will be coming back. Eric the Best bartender in Scottsdale! Very courteous and professional knows all answers about the drinks and food n is very attentive and knows his job and does an excellent job at it. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"MUCH Improved!!!  I had a pretty unpleasant experience dining at Paul Martin's some time ago. I believe it was not too long after they opened. The only thing that lured me back to try again was their 3 course Sunday Prime Rib Special.  It is a beautiful venue, and since it wasn't very busy, I decided to sit at the bar where service would be pretty much captive. From the moment that I sat down, the Bar Tender, Dustin, took excellent care of my dining experience. He was on top of everything. In addition, this time, my food was excellent.   The Prim Rib started with a salad course, then there was a main course of perfectly cooked prime rib and mashed potatoes, and finally three scoops of their house made ice cream, with a couple of out of this world sugar cookies.   The last time I was at Paul Martin's, the salad was so poorly executed and poorly dressed that, since no one came back to check on me after leaving it, I had to resort to making up for the missing dressing with salt. Not so this time! It was perfectly dressed and delicious! Also, because Dustin continuously checked back with me, if there had been anything amiss, I know it would have been tended to.   When I cautiously asked for my Prime Rib rare, he assured me that they would prepare it any way that I would like - and they did! The Prime Rib was delicious, even if I didn't quite get their take on creamy horseradish sauce. It was a little too adulterated with other ingredients, and I couldn't taste the horseradish. I'm not a purist, but when asked, Dustin brought me a little dish of plain horseradish. Perhaps it was house made in some off beat way. It didn't taste like horseradish either, and had absolutely no bite,. That was OK though, the Prime Rib was just fine on its own. The mashed potatoes with the Prime Rib were delicious!  Finally, full as I was, I gave in to the house made ice cream. It was the creamiest ice cream I have ever tasted. Along with it were served the most wonderful \"melt in your mouth\" sugar cookies, with coarse sugar around the edges. I wasn't even close to finishing the ice cream when I had to give up, but I wrapped my other cookie up in a cocktail napkin and took it home for later. No way was I going to leave that cookie behind.  So I had a delicious, well orchestrated meal, and Dustin completely made my experience far and away better than my previous visit. I will definitely be eating at the bar from now on."}
{"text":"The calamari and fried salt & pepper shrimp were freaking (not cussing) good. Had it last night and the leftover still good with my bbq ribs. Coleslaw ehhh. No likey coleslaw. Will come again."}
{"text":"The waiter came to take some plates from our table and I literally told him, \"If you touch mine you'll lose a finger!\"  Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. We've been to great restaurants (Ramsey's, Nobu, etc.). This was a hidden gem. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Hmm the happy hour menu looks great but I  cannot understand why none of it is served during dinner hours. Basically ruining my entire decision to ever return here."}
{"text":"We made reservations on opentable for this place for my 6 yr. Anniversary dinner for the main reason that their menu shows that they focus on healthy eating and the foods change with the seasons. When we arrived we were greeted and sat down right away. The ambience this location has is so warm and comfortable, within minutes we had water at our table and a welcoming waitress asking what she can get us to drink. I stuck with water but my wife and our friend got a beer and I ordered the salt and pepper shrimp as our appetizer. (Yes, we had a friend come along to our anniversary dinner since afterward we were heading to a concert.) The waitress was so friendly and was quick to answer all the questions we had after bringing our drinks back. As we were getting ready to order the shrimp arrived and they were so delicious, They were perfectly seasoned and fried. I ordered the Cajun ribeye and it did not disappoint!!! I absolutely loved it. It was cooked to perfection and so juicy. For dessert we got the Ice cream on top of this cake thing... HAHAHA, don't know what it was called but I pretty much ate the whole thing. I gave my wife a bit and luckily our friend didn't want to try it which I was ok with because it meant more for me. The restaurant has warm and comfortable vibe to it, you can be dressed up or casual and it feels right either way. The cost wasn't that bad either for the amazing food we had!! Usually for healthy option restaurants you have to accept youll have to pay for what you get, in my opinion we got a smoking deal!!! To top it off the staff is amazing, they were so kind and welcoming... We will definitely be making a trip back soon, maybe once the menu changes so we can try something new!"}
{"text":"We love the food and Courtney is he best waiter in town! He always makes us feel so special. It is one of our go-to restaurants in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great atmosphere! Enjoyed the sweet potato fries and ribs, brick chicken was real good."}
{"text":"We were visiting from  California. I love artichokes. The choke here was the best I ever had!  The beef in the French dip was so tender and tasty. The au juis was too salty. My wife had the fried chicken special.  Great deal. Fried chicken was good. The service was professional and courteous."}
{"text":"Shared the Calamari, Blackened Ribeye, Short Ribs, Cedar Plank Salmon and Fish Tacos.  Can not start to tell you how much we loved everything about Paul Martins. Each dish was better than the previous one. The Blackened Rib Eye was prepared spot on and very juicy.  Loved the Calamari with the crisp batter but not dry and it being the real deal.  The Cedar Plank Salmon was also prepared well and very tasty.  Bread soft and fresh and the butter was soft and easy to apply to the bread  A small but detailed touch were the leftovers had written on each container what was in the box.  Absolutely loved this restaurant and will be back."}
