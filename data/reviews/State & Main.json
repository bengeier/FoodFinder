{"text":"Love this place. Beautiful decor and a nice patio for this area. Recommend the gluten free fish tacos which come on lettuce boats for anyone who likes to eat a bit healthier."}
{"text":"Positive environment, pleasant server, but the food was lacking. Ordered no tomato on both the burger and the Margherita Flatbread and was not asked if it was an allergy, they put tomato sauce on the Flatbread(which was not listed on the menu)  The bison burger tasted essentially unseasoned and was thin and depended on the ketchup for flavor.  The buffalo chicken  cheese steak had delicious chicken but the red peppers were cut so large they overpowered the majority of the sandwich   The dill dip and gravy were tasty though, so order fries, those are good."}
{"text":"Horrible place. The servers Always stand around gossiping and I think the manager, tall blonde, has the most annoying laugh, it echoes throughout the restaurant, especially after her shift when she drinks at the bar. Doesn't make your dinner very enjoyable. Also, the conversations at the bar and the language used when all the servers gather after shifts is pretty nauseating. All they do is trash talk other staff members and swear.   Don't come here if you want to listen to trash mouths and irritating laughs. Go somewhere else if you want to enjoy your night out."}
{"text":"Server was awesome, funny, nice, patient and food was great. So stoked on the place. Been to the one in Saskatoon a few times and food wasn't that much different but was just a great experience. Wish I had servers name to be able to name drop on here. Thank you. Will definitely be back and recommend others to go. And music was awesome too, in my mind anyway. But who doesn't like Jimi Hendrix, John Mellencamp, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Blind melon ?"}
{"text":"This place is consistent. The menu is really good, and very broad, so while it stays the same - there are never a shortage of delicious options. The blue cheese salad, butter chicken poutine, sushi, bang bang shrimp, tacos - you get it. It's all so good."}
{"text":"How has this place been open for months and I have never heard of it? I saw that they had brunch so I told my fiancé that we should go try it out.   We got there on a late sunday morning and were greeted by the hostess who showed us to our seat promptly. There wasn't too many other people there yet. (that changed about 15 mins later and the place started filling up)   Although my plan was to get brunch I opted for the pretzel sticks to start and a grilled cheese burger.  The pretzel sticks were awesome! when they arrived at the table I thought at first that they we burn as they were a dark brown color, don't be fooled they were cooked to perfection! So hot and perfectly seasoned on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Comes with a  horseradish mustard dipping sauce so good!!  The grilled cheese burger was just average. Go hungry as it is stacked and just way too much for me to finish. You get 2 sides with it so I got the house greens pretty good and the fries with dill dip.  On a side note I made a comment to my man about how similar the menu was to Original Joe's turns out they are owned but the same group of people hence the similar items on the menu. However State & main offers many things that OJ's does not.... like the pretzel sticks!  I will definitely stop here again when I'm shopping at Chinook."}
{"text":"We were going to give this place another chance when we had some out of town guests who have neither an OJ's or State and Main near them.  I even made reservations earlier in the day just in case and so we wouldn't have to wait for a booth.  When we showed up their doors were locked at 6:30 on a Wednesday. We saw staff moving around inside and knocked. They looked over at us and did nothing, so we left.  We won't be back, especially since this is our second lousy experience in a row."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Had a reservation, no table ready. Food all over the floor and general cleanliness terrible. Super slow service for drinks and food. Will not repeat."}
{"text":"placea joke drunk manager so much gosspip  servers suck n such a neg place to be n dillon the suppose chef which isnt one thinks he can run anyone to the ground hes such a neg guy doesnt treat his workers good at all just abuses them and he sits wit hhis thumb up his ass all day on his phone instead of getting prep done bad attidue"}
{"text":"They have very friendly staffs and good food as well. Went on a date night with my boyfriend, we both like their special martini. Ordered their butternut squash soup (soup of the day) as well, love it."}
{"text":"If I wanted Original Joe's, I'd go to Original Joe's. This is literally IDENTICAL to OJ'S; from the fonts on the menus to the items on the menu. The only things that differ from OJ'S are the name and a few fixtures; not really enough to merit a name change. Not that anything was bad here, but if you're going to make a \"new chain\", then don't be so lazy & actually come up with some new content."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place.   Great location for me about 4 blocks from home.  Have been 4 times since they opened and every time has been great.  Friendly efficient service and great good.  Also reasonably priced.   I enjoy the table set up in the lounge side as it encourages interaction with the people around you.     Overall I recommend everyone give it a shot."}
{"text":"First time and was not disappointed. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Drinks were just what was ordered, and the food was hot, flavorful, and portioned just right. As I finished my last bite I was satisfied I had made the right choice. Unfortunately, had no room for dessert, but that is what I will do on my next visit. Will definitely be back. Best place to eat at Chinook mall!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! It is so close to where I live and I go there every month! You have to try their burgers. The burgers are on a delicious brioche bun. The steak is also five star. I Iike that they included a bit of jalapeño to the mashed potatoes to give it a little kick.  And you have to try the dirt pie for desert! I'd recommend coming here for great family fun!"}
{"text":"I'm less sanguine than reviewer CT about this restaurant's contribution to the dining scene. There isn't much to distinguish it from chains like Earl's or Milestone's, but those places seem to be doing fine, so I'm sure S&M will too. Like those places the menu is a bit of a masculine gastronomic grab bag, with burgers, steaks, meaty salads (e.g. Cobb), and south east asian bowls predominating.  Happy hour specials consist of about a dollar off select beverages and appetizers.  Dark interior with low lighting and plenty of televisions makes it feel like a cross between a sports bar and a casual lounge.  The grilled bread hamburger was substantial with straight up classic flavour, and there are a number of choices for sides. The sauteed brocollini was tasty if a bit underportioned, and the dill dip for the fries a nice touch.  The Manhattan was just right.  Minor variations on what you'd expect at other common chains are welcome, but don't warrant an extra star, so three stars."}
{"text":"Been here for the first time, Nice place with beautiful interior design.  Good location and very easy to park.  The staff were friendly and professional.  The starter plates were fresh and great.  The main dishes was average.. they shouldn't offer a selection of main dishes the chief doesn't now how to prepare !! The burgers patty were too small compared to the bun.. and over cooked !  Prices were resenable.  A good casual place to watch games and have a drink + apatizers."}
{"text":"Gogi tacos and Reuben were both terrific. Can get tacos in lettuce shells for those carb conscious. Service adequate atmosphere suitable the food is above average four of us had no complaints."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of State & Main, and this location was disappointing. The service was slow and the food was not as good as it is at other locations.  We had a late Saturday afternoon lunch.  The restaurant was busy, but not crowded.  We waited over 45 mins for our meals.  I had the sirloin salad, which is my go-to as I (usually) love it! They did not have the usual dressings available, there was no garlic toast with it, there were fewer grilled mushrooms and cheese... it was just... meh...  My son had a burger & fries and his fries were cold - were they sitting in the window for 45 mins? My husband had wings which were under done.  No one came over to see how our lunch was & by then, we were hungry so we ate it.  I would guess that the only thing that keeps this place busy will be the location... if the mall is not busy, the restaurant will be dead."}
{"text":"I've been to State & Main a few times. I have always had good service, and the food is delicious. Tonight, I came in with a few girlfriends after a movie. Food was great as always. We wanted to start with Pretzel Sticks. But they ran out, which was too bad, so I am hoping to get them on my next visit. The real disappointment tonight was our waitress. I don't know if she was new, or just didn't care, but man was she sloooooow. It took her almost 10 minutes to bring our drinks, and never offered us refills. Our food came in a good time frame, which was great. After we finished eating, we sat and waited for 15 minutes for the waitress to clear our plates and give us our bill. Finally, when we still couldn't find her, we asked another waitress to get our bill. She was really nice and apologized. When our waitress did bring the bill, she just dropped it and left. I am a server, and am sympathetic to when one gets \"in the weeds\". But, it wasn't even busy!! So, I do not understand why this waitress was so inattentive. I still am a fan of State & Main, and will come back for sure as the food is always good. But, hopefully I'll have a different waitress next time."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. Ordered delivery, when it got here the salad dressing was EVERYWHERE (RIP salad) and we recieved regular fries vs the yam fries we paid extra for. The manager would only allow a $2.36 refund for the \"French fry\" mishap, but the rest was \"not their problem\". I love paying for food I didn't order and terrible management. Never again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch. Atmosphere was fun and service was great from server...very pleasant and polite and provided fabulous service. Half ways into my meal,there was a hair on my plate and that put me off my meal....when our server came to collect the plates,I told her about the hair.  Mgmt didn't acknowledge it nor was there any reflection of it on the bill!  Overall food was good but due to no response to my complaint of the hair on my plate,I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm a fan! So many options to chose from... so little appetite. This place makes me happy, its well priced so it doesn't hurt your wallet and the portions are huge. The food here is amazing! something that a lot of Calgary restaurants have been lacking. Will be ranting about this place to everyone I know and will soon be a regular!"}
{"text":"Big juicy fish tacos. Certainly best in the city, perhaps anywhere. Chase the bartender is a total pro. I almost don't want to Yelp out about this place because it's just. That. Damn. GOOD."}
{"text":"A really fun sports bar to eat at. Food is consistently good. The staff is friendly and professional. Menu has plenty to offer"}
{"text":"A few waitress was quite rude in regard to us standing near there drink pick up area.  Yes I understand I am in you way but if I am paying for my drinking and I am in your way is because your bartender is serving me there. No need to be rude to customers! Not coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good appetizers. All four mains were marginal at best.  Would be a good place to watch a game, eat appetizers."}
{"text":"Three words... BANG BANG SHRIMP! Must order this, my partner only goes to State and Main for a Shave and a Haircut and their finest, Bang Bang Shrimps. Love the service here and of course the bar's atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"We have given State and Main three chances to win us over. The first time the food was HORRIBLE. We complained and management gave us coupons, since we live so close we went back to use them. The second time we went they weren't very busy and the pacific rim noodle bowl was delicious. So we went back a third time on a friday at 8:30pm were seated and sat for 10 minutes then decided we should leave since they didn't seem to care we were in the building. Service is absolutely rotten and some of the menu items need serious revamping. A TERRIBLE restaurant overall."}
{"text":"My partner and I went in during happy hour. There was one server working the floor, while 2 gentlemen worked behind the bar. It looked as though everyone had been served a drink, so I was a little disappointed to see a lack of support for the one girl working the floor. It took about 15 minutes for us to have our menus and drinks. Once we placed our order, the wait time was much better than our original wait time for menus. Appys for 4$! Tacos, flat bread, calamari! Our bill was 18$ and we were well fed. The tacos lacked a little flavour but Valentina's hot sauce on all the tables makes up for any flavour complaints! I will be going back."}
{"text":"Waited 15 mins to be seated. When shown to our seats there were 5 other tables for 4 empty and only two people left while we were waiting.  My daughter had the chicken tenders which were overcooked.  We ordered calamari to start and the service was great and food came out quick however the calamari was a few tiny over cooked pieces on a plate of breaded deep fried banana peppers and jalapeño peppers which we will never order again. Rest of food was good. Some as always.  Our waiter was wonderful young man whose name I forgot."}
{"text":"Dropped by with some friends over the weekend.  Busy place. We got seated about 10 minutes after we arrived.  There was many tables empty, we just don't know why it took them 10 minutes to find us a table.  Food was ok, nothing great.  Appetizer was the best part of our meal.  Wings and fries."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we received excellent service however it was the meal that was fantastic. Will definitely go back in the hope that this is a consistent experience."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Food is ok but prices are very high.  The ambience is decent but the service has always been on the wrong side of no great.  Much better and more affordable places nearby."}
{"text":"The pros: Great atmosphere, and awesome that kids are welcome. The manager is excellent.  The cons: a tad pricey. My chicken tenders were $14.50. Also a bummer that the tables are bolted to the floor, we had a large party and couldn't sit together. I've found the service in the lounge to be better than the service in the restaurant side, I suspect they start their new staff in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and a drink on a Friday night. Was greeted by friendly hostess and sat on the patio. Had the salmon burger and lettuce wraps. They were delicious.  The service was prompt and friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Are here on a recommendation. We ordered the tuna Tartare and lettuce wraps to start. The Tuna was on top of crunchy rice which was interesting and the dipping sauce was good. I just was expecting something more fresh. The chicken was mixed with top ramen noodles and didn't have an additional sauce. It was just ok. I had the mahi mahi tacos. Again I really expected it to be really fresh and the fish was almost not recognizable. I liked how they grilled the tortillas. They had a nice char on them.  So over all the food was just ok and I am not sure I would choose it again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on St. Patrick's Day. Really, just for dinner! I ordered their steak sandwich with sweet potato fries, and ordered medium rare. When it arrived along with my dinner guests meal my steak was clearly well done. I asked if it could be redone as it was far too cooked for me. The waitress said no problem and took the offending overdone steak. She left me my fries to tied me over, thank god she did. It was over 20 minutes before my steak arrived. However it was brought by a gentleman who I can only assume was the manager, he apologized for the wait and took my meal off our check. The final steak was absolutely melt in your mouth. I'm giving 4 stars for the actual food and for the conduct of the manager. I wish I got his name, but he definitely knows the meaning of customer service!!"}
{"text":"Average at best. Ok pub food but nothing more. I had wings, sliders and tacos. The service is friendly but slow. Great ambiance and would probably be a good place to watch sport with all the big screen tv's."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Portions are amazing for the price. Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Definitely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a few beers and food.  For lunch was kinda slow, maybe due to being Monday when we were there.  Our servicer Sara was great, the food was pricey for what we had.  Now don't get me wrong the food was tasty just not worth the price we paid.   We ordered dragon boat appetizer yummy!! Spicy tuna poke bowl was just okay.  Maybe we are use to having big chunks of tuna in our bowl, that you can actually pickup with your chopsticks. What we got were micro bits put in a pile to look like one big chunk.  Once spread in the bowl we couldn't see the tuna.  (Disappointing for the price) Of course we had a few beers and a pop.   Price came to $54.16 tip on top of this.    Parking and location is nice.   We will be returning but not often."}
{"text":"Disappointing date night with hubby. The restaurant wasn't busy at all but the hostess wanted to seat us at a tiny table right beside another couple. And when I say right beside I mean basically on top of each other!! My husband wasn't having that and asked to sit at a different table. The food came out quick but wasn't that great. Had the steak sandwich and it was burnt (cooked on too high of heat and tasted like charcoal) and the side dishes were mediocre."}
{"text":"Very underrated on yelp considering how rare decent mid-range restaurants there are in Aurora. Meals were delicious for how decently priced they were. Service was excellent. My first experience for this place was all around great, would come again."}
{"text":"State & Main is one great place to eat in Lethbridge, so I was happy to hear that it was opening up a location in Calgary.  Mission 1: Shopping at Chinook. Mission 2: EAT. (Well maybe it was the other way around)   Whichever order that followed, we ended up at State & Main and I have to say that I was very pleased that the menu, food, staff and the space was nicely consistent.  The service was great throughout and so was the food and drinks. This is just one of those nice, safe but fun places to go, the only gripe was that Monkey Bay is no longer on the menu for whites... however, this helped me find a new white to quench my thirst"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. The waitress with the airplane tattoo has the worst attitude of anyone I have ever dealt with in the service industry. I hope you read this. Lighten up!"}
{"text":"Great local bar food and drinks.  What I love most about State and Main is the consistency. Every time I go, I enjoy the food, service and a great Caesar. They also have specials every day of the week and frequently add new items to their menu.   More than just bar food, they have great appetizers, entrees and sandwiches. Would highly recommend this for a casual night of dinner and drinks and/or to watch a game."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place before. We had dinner here with a couple friends who live in the area. Very nice looking place. Very modern. Not huge. Just right actually.    Okay, so I ordered the Main St burger and it was sooo good. I absolutely loved it. One of the best burgers I've had. It was delicious. It came with two sides. There were many to choose from - I chose sweet potato fries and caesar salad. Also very good.   Our server was awesome. The entire staff was great. Anytime a staff member walked past our table they'd remove a dirty plate or fill waters (the way it should be).    So great food, great service, and a great place to meet up with friends.    I'm hoping one will open up here in North Vancouver."}
{"text":"For a corporate restaurant they are good  The staff are fantastic & attentive  Food & drink is always excellent  Always ask what the soup of the day is ! The place gets busy after work & is hoping  Lots of tvs for the sports enthusiast"}
{"text":"Awesome experience today. Great food. Very extensive menu. Server Stephanie was wonderful. Friendly and attentive. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Was in the area yesterday and was looking for a place to do some work with free WiFi and grab a quick bite to eat. I remembered that this new spot had taken over the old Blockbuster Video (RIP) in the Canadian Tire/Winners plaza and while apart of a small chain coming from the West is the only known location around.  The space is impressive with gorgeous detailed fixtures, a huge well stocked bar, a squeaky clean bathroom (some find this important) and a gorgeous outdoor patio space (by most patio standards). To put it in perspective, this is a moxies/earls modern vibe that is trying to make themselves slightly more edgy by utilizing a more rustic reclaimed wood and metal mixture design  Points for service as the staff were friendly and extremely friendly. I had Samantha who made incredible recommendations, was very attentive and in general just awesome - 5 star server!  For food I went with the Fish Tacos (I seem to be on a kick lately), my thoughts were as follows: - at first glance, a huge portion - presentation 5/5 - great flavour - small amount if fish however - a touch overkill on the shredded lettuce as filler, approximately 60% shredded subway iceberg lettuce - not a fan  A saving grace with the meal was the accompanying side salad of mixed greens was great. Light on dressing with a nice bite of goats cheese, I'm stealing this recipe for myself at home.  For a first visit I found the total package to be A-OK and would likely return t try some other offerings and adjust my review accordingly. So until next time...  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"The menu is amazing and the food was off the charts! I had a chicken wing starter and fettuccine and meatballs. The food was so amazing! The only reason it didn't get the fifth start was because the music was so loud that it was hard to talk. I'm not at a club...I'm going out for dinner and conversation. TURN THE MUSIC DOWN!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a quick date before picking up our son from daycare yesterday. I had the fish tacos and the house blond ale. My wife had the French dip with poutine and quinoa salad. Everything was fresh and delicious. Generous portions and nice presentation of the dishes. Clean, stylish and inviting dinning area. Great spot! Fun fact: it's located in the old blockbuster video unit. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Both service and food quality have recently gone way down hill. Service used to be attentive and pleasant, now you are lucky to get a refill on your coke without having to ask more than once for it.I used to really enjoy the New York Steak, the quality and flavour would rival most high end steakhouses. Recently I have found the steak to be not nearly as good, seeming to be prepared with much less care and attention."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, and am currently in the process of finding more friends who haven't been, so I can take them.  I'll admit, when I first went in, I assumed it was going to be a snooty, upscale wannabe type of restaurant. How quickly my judgement was changed. The atmosphere is great- relaxed, energized, and hugely social. Some may describe it as \"loud\", and I'm sure it is if you prefer to eat in silence. But for those of us who tend to chat and eat, it's great. TVs all over the walls, playing various sports. A dimmer lit dining experience, similar to The Keg, however it creates an intimate feel, and is a great place for date night or girls night (Thursdays are 1/2 price bottles of wine!)  The menu is concise and sweet. Great selections of appetizers and mains. It's big enough to provide variety, but not too big in that you get lost with it. A modern style menu, one page front and back. Clean and simple. Most of the main dishes come with 2 side orders, so you're certainly getting your money's worth. I highly recommend the Bang Bang Shrimp- spicy, crispy, shrimpy, deliciousness.   Many of the servers who have waited on us are great girls. They know the menu, they know the drinks. Even on a busier night, our orders arrive within a fair amount of time. I'm never left wondering where the heck my food is. They're pretty good about checking up on your as well, which is often something that is missed in other restaurants. Smiling, happy, hardworking girls. They do a great job."}
{"text":"Apparently the $12 \"Wedge Salad\" is a head of lettuce cut in two. You literally have to cut your salad with a steak knife. Dear management, there is a reason a \"salad fork\" exists but not a \"salad knife\". Bite size pieces please.  Did I complain? You bet I did. The server laughed and said \"haha yeah it's weird\" and walked away. At the very least have them forward the feedback to the chef. Awful. And the payment machines asked for a 18% gratuity. Earn it."}
{"text":"We were walking along 8th ave on a Saturday afternoon/early evening when we saw a sign out front advertising $4 happy hour food & drink specials til 9pm so we decided to check it out.  The place was a ghost town when we got there so we figured we'd sit at the bar. The bartender was friendly and courteous.  Since there were food specials advertised, we decided to try a couple of the appetizers listed in the happy hour menu. We had the pretzels and calamari. Both were excellent! The pretzels were warm and soft and came with a delicious mustard-type dip. The calamari was flavorful and was a nice size.  It was a nice place with a slightly upscale feel to it, but not so much that you feel out of place if you're not wearing a suit. The staff seemed friendly and attentive. The bar tender was great at multi-tasking; making 2 drinks at a time, serving the wait-staff and also serving a table of ladies.  The only negative thing I can say is that when our bill came, we were charged full price for the appetizers. Apparently the food specials are only Monday-Friday and they chose not to have anything on special Saturday because they had a large group reservation come in. If it was our error, I can accept that. But it does frustrate me that the bartender knew we were only looking at the Happy Hour menu and didn't think to mention it at the time of ordering. When we asked him about the bill, he even said he should have told us when we ordered and he told us it was Happy Hour when we arrived.  We may go back, but we'll definitely be more vigilant when ordering next time."}
{"text":"With the busy holiday season, we decided to stop here for a quick lunch before shopping at Chinook centre.  This is actually the first time I've been to State and Main in Calgary, and I had been meaning to try ever since it opened up in Chinook centre.  Overall - I would say it is a pretty standard N American kitchen and bar which met my expectations.  Atmosphere: 3/5 Overall comfortable and good ambience; it was a little dark for a lunch restaurant and the chairs were a little high on one side and low on the other.  Noise level ok.   Several TVs and interesting wall paintings.  Conveniently located in chinook centre  Food: 3/5  I had the Hollywood bowl which seemed like a healthy option with salmon, avocado, chickpeas, asparagus, radish, quinoa, and yam.  The yams had a bit of spice which I liked.  Overall adequate amount of food and filling, but the ingredients somehow did not really seem to go well together.  I would be open to trying another menu item next time.  Service: 3/5  Adequate; overall friendly however slow at times eg water refills and the bill  Price: 2.5/5  A little high for the amount and quality of food  Overall: 3/5  Overall quite standard and met my expectations for a kitchen and pub; I was slightly disappointed in my dish as I thought the ingredients would go better together but I would be open to trying some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Wine wine wine !! Can we avoid the overuse of BC wines. No, it's not political, it's enjoyment! Just please get a California Chardonnay on the menu."}
{"text":"Brunch wasn't very good. Portion was okay. Home fries are frozen deep fried kind. Eggs over cooked. The bacon tasted like the grease was off. Only got one sausage. Not worth the price of eggs and carbs. No breakfast meats other than pork. They advertise brunch on the door but only have a small corner of the menu with maybe 6-7 items. Service was good, and I've had a good dinner here before. Really disappointed.  Wouldn't come again for brunch, would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Good vibe, friendly staff, unfortunately every time we go we seem to be seated by the door and every time someone came in we would freeze due to the breeze. Food was pretty good.    Edit: I've had to lower my rating from 4 to 3 stars as I have returned a couple month after the first review to be amazed on how poor the quality of food had become. Ordered an appetizer of the Thai chicken bites (I forget what they called it there) it's basically the same thing as the Thai chicken bites from Boston pizza but with an inflated prize, didn't taste bad just over priced seeing as you can get it cheaper at Boston pizza. Ordered combination plate of ribs and chicken breast as the main meal, there was barely any meat on the ribs and the chicken was dry and hard to chew.   Fortunately the waitress was friendly and polite, discounted the plate as we complained of its quality."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to go to  this place for a while now as it's only been open for a few months.  I had looked it up because I've never heard of the place to see that it's yet another restaurant from out west.  We've had plenty of new comers from out west like Joey, Cactus Club, Earls, etc.  We arrived a bit before 7pm on a Friday and the place was kind of packed.  We were however seated immediately as we were asked for either inside or outside and because the evening was rather pleasant we decided on outdoors.  Having walking through the inside along with the place being pretty much at capacity, inside visually and with the background music it seemed rather loud.  I was happy to be able to get a peaceful table outside actually.  Out the doors we turned left around the corner and then left again basically at the table furthest from the entrance on the Burnhamthorpe side close to the patio exit.  It was quiet yet private as we only had one table beside us.  We had a good look at the two sided menu and all the sides and choices etc.  Our server eventually came and offered some drinks.  At this time it's already after 7pm so we sort of missed the first wave of happy hour and the next wouldn't be for another 2 hours (9pm).  She did however mention that there were cocktail specials for 7 bucks and showed us on the drink menu.  I had said I was in the mood for a beer instead.  My wife had ordered a glass of white zinfandel.  We had decided to go with the Buffalo wings to start, while my wife ordered the salmon club sandwich with ginger cilantro slaw and jalapeno cheddar cornbread.  I went with the grilled cheeseburger with the soup of the day and poutine.  What I found kind of different is that you are offered 2 sides instead of just one while some are no extra charge you can choose to upgrade the sides for a nominal extra charge such as what I did.  I couldn't help but notice that for whatever reason things for us were moving slow.  I mean between sitting, ordering, getting the drinks, ordering food, getting the app, getting our mains it was taking more time than I was expecting or would tend to think it should have taken.  The table beside us (the only table) was there before we arrived and had paid and left.  Another couple had taken that table after them, ordered, eaten, paid and also left.  I couldn't think of anything we had ordered that would really have taken that long.  I mean we had wings, a sandwich and a burger.  It came to the point that our server actually came up to us and said something of how it was taking rather long for us and would check to see what was going on.  Honestly to me that saved the night because if I had to say something I wouldn't have been too happy.  Our food did come out and it looked really good.  The serving for the sandwich and sides are long plates because the food well it's a pretty big serving.  I do have a small handful of places that I keep on a list of burgers that are over 16 dollars... it's like an echelon that if you're charging 16+ I put you into another category all your own.  Tonight the grilled cheeseburger was going against the likes of Dymond's DSK and Cactus Club's Feenie burger.  I have to say it was really, really good.  I mean if the suspense was to make us wait long for our food, mission accomplished.  The beauty of this burger is that it's not so large that I have to take things off to be able to bite into it and it's not named after some chef to the point of being overrated.  No, this burger is solid in every way from the way it's stacked to the texture of the entire stack, top to bottom.  The burger is on grilled French bread as opposed to the other offerings which are on brioche buns which are actually what I prefer as far as burgers go.  I'll go out of my way sometimes to get brioche buns or Ace bakery buns instead of using the regular buns when I make burgers.  The grilled bread if toasted just right with the bottom layer being 2 melted cheeses up against the burger then the bacon, and fried onions then the fresh veggies are cool and crispy on the top inside layer with another grilled slice of bread to complete the pocket of crunch the grilled bread creates.  So the first time experience with this place was that it took long to get everything.  I was joking with my wife that we'd probably be still there for the second wave of happy hour and by the time we had paid and left being well into 9pm, it became true.  From arriving to leaving and everything in between we were there for a good 2 hours plus.  The wait was long, there's no way to sugarcoat that.  The food was good and the service was good and pleasant overall.  If the kitchen was going to take as long as they were going to take I can't fault our server for that in fact her noticing and mentioning that it was taking long is good, honest and fair.    Because the wait was borderline unacceptable for now I'll give them a 3.  I think we'll return still hoping it will be better next time."}
{"text":"Man I thought it would be another Joeys/Earls like experience. But NOPE, WAAAAY better. They have a huge menu which is really nice, and it's all very well priced (definitely cheaper than Earls and Joeys). The portions were huge! Another win. But most important - The food was delicious!!!! Such good fries! (Often find places never can get fries right). The club sandwich came with TWO sides!! Mash potatoes anddd a quinoa salad. Both were delicious. We also ordered fish tacos, and a basic chicken tenders... plus gyoza to start. It was far too much food for the three of us.   I will definitely be going here a LOT more. Will replace joeys with state & main for my pre-movie dinner!   It's really nice to go to a restaurant where everyone leave's satisfied."}
{"text":"More than anything, this place is a great addition to the area. I've been here a few times for lunch and/or drinks with clients and coworkers so it's a great local somewhat low-key place.  I tried their fish tacos but I was not a fan at all. Joeys is way better! Next, I got the chicken gyoza which I really liked. Most recently I tried the burrito bowl because I couldn't decide on anything else. You're better off going next door to Bar Burrito - slightly cheaper but much better. Hopefully I enjoy whatever I order next time. Service has always been fine. The parking lot is extremely small to cater to a restaurant like this but so far I haven't had any issues myself"}
{"text":"My husband and I love ordering take away from State and Main. The food is just as delicious at home. I think it's a nice touch that they include gravy with the fries. Most places would charge extra. My only issue is that they do not allow kids in the bar. This I find most ridiculous when the dining room is full and there is availability in the bar area but because of the no kid rule we have to wait. It is at that point we head to the keg, a place that doesn't follow such silly rules."}
{"text":"Great service, location, food, and prices!  I love the decoration of the restaurant. The food is always amazing, they also have some gluten free options, which is always nice."}
{"text":"New addition to Chinook Mall, chicken gyoza over fried and crunchy, filling flavorless (need to add onion and garlic), dipping sauce excellent Japanese style  Lasagna with chorizo HUGE and HOT, tasty, cheesy and meaty  Service at the bar excellent"}
{"text":"New to Airdrie, just opened last week. This Restaurant/bar is very similar to Original Joes, as they are owned by the same company.  Great food, two sides when you order a burger or sandwich(get the corn bread!). Lots of staff and they provide great service."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this establishment, the first was when they opened. Here's my take on the first visit, service was lacking & very slow but the server was friendly. It wasn't busy when we arrived so there was no reason service was so slow. Our table needed refills on drinks that took 1/2 hour to get(she may have forgotten) now the food was good & portions are ample. Our table tried a few things; shrimp appetizer(plump battered shrimp w/aioli),dragon boat lettuce wraps, chicken gyoza all delish. Mains ordered were burgers, chorizo lasagna(filling!) a little too salty perhaps due to the chorizo.  On tonight's visit 2nd time there we ordered battered shrimp aioli appetizer. Good like the last time.  Main meals were chicken fingers w/fries-good; kids burger which looked like a regular burger until we lifted the bun to see how small the burger patty was(wrong size bun for a kids burger patty) we laughed it off. I had the \"grilled cheese-burger\" this thing is huge & was tasty, but a simple burger;nothing to blow the mind for a $17.00 burger other than the fact it's nestled between 2 large slices of bread. I think that's my main beef (no pun intended) with this place is they charge )$17.00 for a bread dominant burger. We also tried the butter chicken-delish & huge. The Naan bread was overcooked & bland.  Overall I like the food here;atmosphere is very very casual like an upscale pub-diner combo. I don't mind that but the prices are a little on the expensive side for certain burgers for this type of atmosphere casual resto.But the service was really slow & lacking again tonight;though friendly. We waited for a long time again for refills. I love dining out & taking my time but when I'm in a really casual place I expect a little more speed. I don't want to have to flag down my server for a refill or wait another 1/2 hour to be asked if I want dessert. Anyway this is nice to have in Aurora but since New Market is 5 minutes away I prefer to go to my favs that way; cause I prefer the food,vibe & ambiance & service & bang for my buck at Moxies."}
{"text":"I've been on three separate occasions now, twice was just for drinks with friends and once for lunch with a coworker. The food is consistently good. The service the first time I went was left to be desired but otherwise it was a good overall experience."}
{"text":"Went there on Friday for dinner. Sat at the bar area which was nice and clean. Our waitress was amazing she was fast and knew her stuff. The food was okay... Found the prices a bit high for what you are getting. I will for sure becoming again though."}
{"text":"First time visiting this weekend. We ordered the bang bang shrimp, sweet potato fries and the splanko flat bread/pizza. It was all amazing. Tasted great with good portions. My only complaints is that the serving plate we got were all covered in finger print smudges and the bang bang shrimp had a little piece of dark hair. I didn't make a fuss about it."}
{"text":"Went into state and main for some dinner with my boyfriend. We waited so long for our waitress to come over to take our order because she was busy chatting with a girl at the bar for SO long. I was tempted to move to the bar and sit there for some actual service. The food was amazing as always. The service was terrible. She seemed to hate her job, she was careless, rude, and when I asked for my food to go she did not put my dipping sauce in. Aswell as when my boyfriend ordered the rice bowl, he was not given the proper sauces (siracha) or chopsticks to enjoy his meal. I will come back to state and main aslong as I do not have kaitly as my server. It was horrible and made our dinner terrible."}
{"text":"As stated previously, fairly similar menu to Original Joes but better (in my opinion). Do yourself a favour and get the corn bread and fries with dill dip!  My wife and I had a very difficult time deciding what to get because we both had multiple options we couldn't choose between! We decided on the Rueben and the Buffalo chicken cheesesteak (or whatever it's called :P). Amazing food, and excellent beer/drink selection. We went on a Monday afternoon so it wasn't very busy. Service was great."}
{"text":"I have had quite a few meals and get-togethers at State & Main in Aurora and have had a good experience each time. My favourite dishes are the spanako flatbread, the hummus and grilled naan (so, so good!) and the Long Beach fish tacos. They have drink specials each day as well as their daily/nightly 3-6 p.m. happy hour and 9 p.m. to close specials. The ambiance is quite nice - they have a smaller dining room and a larger bar area with lots of tables and TVs. They also have a gluten-sensitive menu which is great for those people who need it."}
{"text":"Best your can hope for is mediocre service.  Food is OK but they have a crazy sense of entitlement here that they don't deserve.  I'd pick Boston pizza and save my lineup.   Just being downtown doesn't automatically make a place good.  Poor service..."}
{"text":"I came here for the Bacon and Tomato Soup.   I decided to read up on the nutritional information AFTER my visit. Here's what I consumed:   SERVING SIZE 382g  CAL 790  FAT 48g SAT  FATS 27g  TRANS FAT 0g  CHOL 145mg  CARBS 57g  FIBER 4g  PROTEIN 26g  SODIUM 2370mg  Do you see the amount of sodium in that?! Someone between the ages of 14-50 should only be consuming 1500mg of it. That one bowl of soup was almost DOUBLE my daily intake.   I basically ate a bowel of salt. Yes, I'll admit, is was absolutely delicious, but seeing that made me want to regurgitate my food. *induce vomiting*  I give that soup a .5, because I feel gross after eating it, but I would like to go back as the decor was great and the service was friendly and welcoming. The menu was appealing and as I have glutton intolerance it's really great to see a restaurant that has gluten free breads and buns.   Read the nutrition guide before going here!!!! Be warned."}
{"text":"Really slow service, even when it's not busy. Food is your normal pub food, it's just OK. It's a mediocre place close to home, not my first pick to eat at. The jalapeno Mac and cheese is good though, that's why I'm giving it three stars instead of two."}
{"text":"Overall I like this place, great neighbourhood hangout, nice patio, trendy interior design inside, music isn't too loud, the bathrooms are individual rooms with locking doors which is a nice upgrade from stalls. The food is overall pretty good, standard high end pub fare, I love the bacon tomato soup. Nice local beer selection and their Caesars are always on special. I'll be a regular here for as long as they'll have me."}
{"text":"Went here not knowing what to expect as we have never eaten at this location or any other in Calgary. The food was terrible. We ordered a flatbread and a calamari - both were greasy and over salted and just generally bad tasting. Our server was very nice and attentive but no amount of great service could compensate for how crap the food is. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Dined on Friday, October 2nd with three others.  Service was good, Bang Bang Shrimp, very nice.  My Wedge Blue Cheese salad, a disaster.  Dressing was an unrecognizable pepper-laden creamy vinaigrette.  Called the waitress and said there was a mistake, that they gave me the wrong dressing.  She insisted that was their Blue Cheese restaurant-made Blue Cheese.  I am a Blue Cheese dressing addict.  I was annoyed that they tried to insult my intelligence by passing this dressing off as Blue Cheese.  I know it was a mistake and they wouldn't own up to it and correct the problem.  That will keep me from dining there again.  Also, almost broke a tooth on the \"bacon\".  Lastly, it wasn't a crispy wedge but just a mound of lettuce.  Otherwise, varied menu, nice decor, attentive service."}
{"text":"State & Main is a good alternative to Earls/Joeys/Cactus Club. Last night we went to the Chinook location.  I had the sausage lasagne which was very tasty, prepared in its own ceramic dish and not a huge portion. It was a winner all around.  The service was adequate.  My only complaint is that the wine list is very skinny and pedestrian."}
{"text":"Not sure if I liked this place but would give it a nod of approval.  The service was okay, the waitress was helpful in deciding on what to order but then disappeared during the meal when we wanted another drink.  The food was quite good.  The sauces for the wings weren't very tasty.  Tried one, switched to another and didn't bother a third time.  Worth another try, just won't order their wings."}
{"text":"We sat on their patio on Mother's Day for a drink and some appies.  It's a nice patio with lots of tables and not over crowded.  Our server came to take our drink orders, but before we could order our appies, she cut us off and said she'd be right back.  She brought our drinks quickly enough, but again before we could place our order, she took off again and said she'd be right back.  20 minutes later I had to grab her attention to order our food, and once again she said she'd be back after she delivered cutlery to another table.  When we finally did get to order our food, it came quickly and was really tasty, but by this time we'd been sitting there for almost an hour.    We spoke to the manager, and she said there was only one server for the patio that day, which was poor planning considering it was Mother's Day and a gorgeous day outside.  She took the drinks off our bill, but ultimately, our server was terrible with poor time management skills and we were wishing we'd gone across the parking lot to the Toad 'n Turtle, which is what we'll be doing next time."}
{"text":"$23 for a Reuben sandwich and an iced tea?  How good does it need to be?  State and Main looks a lot like Milestones on the inside, definitely a rich interior.  The menu has a pretty good variety at slightly elevated prices, but the Reuben sandwich caught my attention as a decent lunch at $14.  Maybe a bit spendy, but with 2 side dishes, I was in.  I selected a Caesar salad and cup of the Bacon and Tomato soup.  Of course a Reuben needs some hot mustard, so I asked for a bit.  Surprise!  The soup was not one of the permitted side dishes, so add that to the bill.  I was not offered the second side dish. And don't forget that they charge for condiments-the two tablespoons of mustard was $1.25 extra.  If I had added relish, ketchup and mayo, would I expect another $3.75? Glad I didn't find out.  But is it a Reuben worth $20?  I would not have a problem with any dish that lives up to its price, but this was no better than a $9 Reuben at any Montreal style deli."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite local spot.  They are pretty new and still going through some growing pains, which is why I didn't give them 5 stars. I think they will be worthy of 5 soon.  The staff are mostly great, the food is tasty/good value for $ and they have drink specials every night.  Lots of TV's for game nights and overall a fun place to be."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to place. Honestly from appetizer to dessert, just wow. Food prices reasonable too. Great service. Forget Moxies.... this is place to be seriously."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is delicious and the servings are fantastic.  I have eaten here several times but my experience today was phenomenal.  I literally thought customer service did not exist anymore until today.  My coworkers and I won a Vanilla Visa gift card for our Halloween costumes.  We chose to use it today, unbeknownst to us, they only let you spend 80% so our $75.00 card was only worth 62.50 (that is a review for another page, but don't ever waste your money on one of these) Anyhow after going back and forth on the phone and feeling like we were some sort of con artists, we asked the Manager if he could help us.  This gentleman went out of his way to try different ways to help.  Finally we got the credit card issuer on the phone for a second time, to find out where the rest of the money was....we spent in excess of 30 mins dealing with this, and I am sure he had much better things to do.  He treated us with respect, he never once got impatient, and he offered solutions.  I can't even begin to tell you how impressed all 5 of us were and spoke about it amongst ourselves and with other coworkers upon returning to the office.  Jason, ( I believe that was the managers name) could give seminars on how to treat customers.  In society today, being treated like a human being is rare...being treated like an important human being just doesn't happen.  Thank you, Jason and staff.  You guys rocked it today!"}
{"text":"Nice place. My first time back in aurora since it opened. Very classy but casual looking place. This could easily become a favorite as aurora is sorely missing a place like this.   Lots of TV's, lots of great Canadian beers on tap.   Came here for lunch. Brought the kids. They don't have a printed kids menu but ask for what's on it. I had the tomato soup and a wedge salad. Tomato should was really good. Slightly salty - but good none the less. I love tomato soup - and I liked this one very much. The wedge was decent. It's missing bacon (didn't go back and check the menu to see if it was not included or just not in the recipe. Regardless - like everything else - bacon would make it better. The blue cheese was too clumped together too.   Service was great and persistent.   Must try if you're in aurora."}
{"text":"Great food, perfect for lunch. Last time I was here in the evening, it was too loud. Other than that minor glitch, best place to eat at Chinook."}
{"text":"I actually like this place. They have a great menu and the potions are decent. Haven't had a bad meal here. Nice staff and easier to get a table here than at joeys. Try the butter chicken poutine...you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in and have a meal. So many good things on a bum. The four of us had a great time, service and food were very good. It's a bit over priced, but the quality of food is right up there. Going to try the pizza next time seen so many going by us."}
{"text":"So .... I usually like to give restaurants a couple of chances. But I gotta say this is twice now that I've been let down by this place.  The first was a few months ago when I found steel wool in my mash potatoes.  I get it, they cleaned the equipment with some kinda steel wool scrubber and a little came off and it ended up in the food.  It's gonna happen, just glad I didn't eat it. However it's the way the manager dealt with it that got on my nerves. He didn't seem too concerned and was a little too laid back about it. Didn't comp my meal, but did comp an appetizer. So not impressed, but figured I'd try again today.   Went for lunch, ordered the fish and chips, same meal as my wife. Hers was a nice hunk of fish. Mine was not so much.  So I ordered a second piece of fish, as I was hungry. Took a long time to come, I was actually finished my meal and was waiting.  Finally it comes, what a mistake. As soon as I put my fork on it, oil was all over the plate. Yupp, sent that back, had it taken off the bill, paid and got the f&$k outta there. Not going back. Done with them."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. Service is good and food is even better. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, nice patio. The food isn't anything too exciting. The menu has a lot of options, it can probably satisfy whatever you are in the mood for. Both dishes we ordered were in lacking flavour (Gogi Tacos and Teriyaki Bowl).   It's a decent local spot if you're looking for a weekly special. I will go back to give it another shot!   The service was okay, the waiter and manager were nice but they aren't going to go above and beyond to accommodate your needs."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the door, the hostess gave us a huge lecture for parking in the 15 minute spot and told us that the owner from the Mr Sub shop next door just walked by and would be very upset to see someone had parked in HIS parking spots. Well, number one: there was no sigh that the spots belonged to him, and number 2: its actually not your business where I park because that would be MY problem if I were to be towed away, right? I had no idea I was entering a restaurant with a parking by law officer waiting to seat me. So, after that encounter, I really just wanted to walk out, but we were starving, so I decided to leave my car in the almighty 15 minute parking spot and take a seat.   Receives *side eye from the aforementioned parking hostess*.  The service was great, and the food too, but the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the fact that when you ordered a meal and wanted the \"vegetarian\" option, they still charged you for the chicken?? Huh? How can you charge me for something I'm not receiving? At least give me the chicken and I can give it to my dog to enjoy. But, the lettuce wraps, cole slaw, quinua and salads were very tasty and fresh.  Would I go back? Probably not....The hostess ruined it for me. I wont describe her because I dont want to publicly shame her, but if the manager wants to message me, I can tell you what she looks like so you can possibly have a word with her and how she approaches new customer with respect to where they are parking."}
{"text":"Patio time at last!! We met some friends for drinks at State and Main. They had a special on Caesars. I had the spicy and it was really good.  We also had some pita and hummus which was nice for sharing and in honor of my first dragon boat team practice coming up tomorrow night, I had the dragon boat lettuce wraps. They were great. The romaine was crisp and the filling was made with chicken and crunchy noodles with a spicy peanut sauce.   The patio was a little blah. When the view is a parking lot, you need to spruce things up a bit with plants, barriers....something! The music was 70s rock which our friends like. Casual sports bar vibe inside.   Looks like a good summer go-to place for pub fare perhaps after dragon boat practice."}
{"text":"I've been go this restaurant a few times now. They have by far the best calamari in the city !! I hated any kind of seafood until I had their calamari! Now I go out of my way to get it ! The  French onion soup was pretty bad it wasn't much of a soup there was no liquid in it basically a cheese/onion loaf. But I'll give them benefit of the doubt because every time I've gone something impressed me !"}
{"text":"I typically avoid Chinook Mall for a number of reasons:  1) I'm a guy 2) Malls are avoided by myself and most guys I know 3) It's always busy 4) I'm a guy  The only reason I ever go to Chinook not against my will is to see a movie. For Christmas shopping as well, I always make it an Amazon Christmas. What guy doesn't want to play Bioshock while he does Christmas shopping?   Nevertheless, I ended up at the mall again for another dose of Guardians. I arrived a bit early so decided beer was in order. It was after 12pm so don't judge.  State & Main has been here for a while, so I decided to give it a try. Walking in, I was greeted by 3 ladies and promptly taken into the bar side with a menu. The man at the bar was the size of an average gladiator. I believe his name was Nick. He greeted me quickly and had a tasty beer in front of me even faster.  During my time there, the food I ordered was great, Nick was probably the best bartender I'd ever had. Don't worry; I'm still awesome. Everything works out in the end. Extra star for me? No? Damn. Great food is not awesome food, so 4 stars and a huge thank you to this place. Extra star for Nick and an odd 5 star for this place based quite a bit on service. Will I be back at the mall? Ummmmm...ummmm... I hate it, but perhaps I will."}
{"text":"The new Mahogany location, very similar to all the other locations, same menu and inside decor. Although it wasn't very busy when we were there in the evening mid-week it was very loud which was distracting. The food was decent and our server was friendly."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and give it a good review but they absolutely destroyed my hamburger and I just hated it, I actually couldn't even finish it. Ok so where do I start?   We ordered the Mac & Cheese with Jalapeño and it was good, lots of cheese and heat with every bite, that's really the only reason they are getting two stars, the restaurant wasn't even full and we had three servers who couldn't figure out my drink order so the manager had to pour the beer.   I looked at the burgers and I love burgers that is my thing so when you ruin a good burger and your suppose to be a comfort food / bar you should really know how to make a good burger. First off the patty was way over cooked and small, I got the grilled cheese bun however it was just some processed cheese on a piece of white bread, not melted or grilled, just there it was horrible. I had two bites and I couldn't eat anymore I returned it and just was completely turned off by the place. I would t waste your money here it's a shame because the set up is great no matter where you sit you have clear views of the games, but that's it. Maybe they should retrain or get new staff for the kitchen."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and to watch the Olympics while waiting for my car to be cleaned at Bubbles across the street. Staff were very pleasant and accommodating. They changed the channel to the Olympics when I requested it. Sorta surprised they don't have TV's on different channels... Pretty quiet on Monday during lunch. All in all good. This is my second time here and both times have been pretty good. Will be back again."}
{"text":"The new Mahogany location is now open. While OJ's on 130th is closer to home, and they're very similar, my wife loves the pretzel sticks (now bites) so we'll probably end up here more often.  The space is wide open compared to other State & Main locations in the city. There's a large bar with tables around it and another section off to the side over by the patio. It also seems brighter with lots of windows.  The beer selection is good with a mix of styles, mostly local options and a bunch of taps that rotate. Our dinners were good, but nothing outstanding. I went with the buffalo chicken cheese-steak. It's not as gooey and salty as your average cheese-steak. The spiciness could be charged up a little too.  The service was really good. Our server was on it all night and other staff helped out where needed.  Downer of the meal was the key lime pie in a jar. Not so good overall."}
{"text":"Always a solid experience here. The wife loves their pretzel sticks so we'll pop in here for a light brunch/lunch on the weekend before hitting a movie or doing some shopping. Despite being in the mall, I've only had to wait for a table once, though I'm sure its a different story if you're coming here for dinner.  The only issue I've ever had here was on my last visit where they didn't put any chicken on my Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl. They were all over it though having the manager come over to apologize and take care of a portion of the bill."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 15 people, when we arrived the hostess didn't have it recorded and tried to tell us it was the wrong phone number. After hitting redial it rang right to her phone. She just kept encouraging us to leave and wasn't helpful at all."}
{"text":"A good spot for lunch, especially when the cocktails are on special. Kids are welcome which is awesome. Food is good, really like the jalapeño cheeae mashed potatoes and the homemade cinnamon buns are delicious.   Has a nice decor inside and a good sized patio outside. Its really busy during lunch so make a reservation!"}
{"text":"A nice place indeed with good ambiance. Went there for a weekday lunch, it was not that crowded. The service was good and prompt.   I had The Empire State steak, medium rare. It was not that flavourful as expected (or boasted in the menu), it was ok, probably 3 star out of 5."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now and each time the service is great and the food is fantastic. Servers are helpful and friendly and are around just the right amount. And the food... I think I can put it best by saying that whoever designs the menus / cooks the food has a real passion for what they're doing. There's a real creativity here, but creativity that actually goes toward making good-tasting food as opposed to some nonsense that only presents well and nothing more. Portions are great and meat-lovers such as myself will be pleased. Do yourself a favour and have the jalapeno cheddar cornbread as a side dish; you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and decor, they are even have electric outlets to charge your phone in between the booth, food is ok, is the perfect place to watch a game and have a beer or cocktail, they have an amazing happy hour every day, 3-6 pm, beer was only $4 , the service is also pretty good."}
{"text":"March 29th 2018 was my last day of work. After work, my boyfriend drove me to State & Main Kitchen & Bar to have a dinner.  We have been State & Main in the City of Lethbridge before. This was our first time having dinner at this Calgary location. We had a pleasant dining experience at this restaurant.  Environment  We arrived the restaurant around 5 pm. It was not busy. We could get a table very easier. After we sat down, the server brought the menu to us. Inside the restaurant, all the setting and decorations were the same as other State & Main location. It was very nice and clean.  Serve  Our table server was very nice and friendly. She gave us great suggestions for the drink. Very helpful.  Food & Prices  We have ordered $17.00 PACIFIC RIM NOODLE BOWL and STEAK SANDWICH $21.50.  Our food came out the kitchen was fast. They were all well cooked and fresh. Inside my noodle bowl included chicken, shrimp, steamed vegetables & rice noodles, simmered in a spicy flavorful broth. chili oil & fresh lime on the side. It was very health noodle bowl. I loved the soup flavor so much. The steak sandwich was enjoyed by my boyfriend's dining companions. It was six-ounce steak, seasoned & cooked your way; served open faced on garlic toasted french bread. All the dish seemed like a great value for us. We enjoyed the atmosphere, food, and the service so much. Highly recommend people go State & Main."}
{"text":"It's your typical pub style food and decor. Burgers, fish and chips and other typical varieties. It's was really empty, so the service was excellent. It's all dark woods and dim lighting with only a small window in the front, so it dates itself on the decor. Overall my party was happy with the portions and quality of the food. Prices were average $15-$18 per dish."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying State & Main and won'r bother going back.  The service was terrible - slow and our waitress never came back to check if we needed more water, etc., but yet she had time to stand around chatting with the other waitresses.   The food was not great...considering the price.   Because the service was so slow, we had to ask for our food to be boxed to go...the waitress plunked the boxes on the table and took off.   Mediocre food and bad service....give it a pass."}
{"text":"We went there on a weekend, got seated in no time and the service and food quality were all pleasant. They forgot to bring our appetizer, which sucked, but I won't hold it against them as these things happen. Our server apologized and apart from that we had a pleasant night.  In a location like Chinook mall, which can sometimes get very crowded, this place is a pleasant addition to your food and drink choices."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch time and it was quite busy. I left the office at 11:30 and showed up before noon too.   We ended up sitting at the bar. I got the basin burger. The burger came with two sides: Caesar salad and honey slaw. The Burger was delicious. Wished the patty could be a bit bigger. Inside the burger there are lettuce, tomatoes, onions, lots of cheddar cheese (this is a plus), bacon ketchup (serious not missing a comma) and in a nice buttered bun.  I originally had the burger with the jalapeno cheddar mash potatoes but it was too spicy and had that replaced.   Loved the service. Food did take a long time to come out. But its all good. I was not in a hurry.   It is in the verge of downtown so parking is still brutal.   Overall, recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Slow become our local place. Nice little Busy vibe happening. Always busy. After work crowd as well as date night. Menu has diversity! Out of all the places State and Main offer variety. Tuna tartare is amazing. Dragon boat lettuce wraps are good as well.  Korean chicken is very flavourful. Burgers and sandwiches come with two sides of your choice. We've tried them all and they're delicious!  Oh yes! Daily drink specials"}
{"text":"Parking: Free - big lot with easy to find parking.  Washrooms: Bathrooms were pretty baller status.  Experience/Venue: Very big venue and seating for large group of people and parties. I was here for a birthday brunch with a group of 15+  Food: I ordered a burger and made it vegan from what I remembered. Food was aight...."}
{"text":"Went here to try it out with a girlfriend last week. After checking out the menu and seeing the milk and cookies I was really excited to try it. We went and ordered our dessert and some wine, the food and wine was great. The issue I had was with service. Our server embarrassed my friend by accusing her of being underage (after we showed our ids). We tried explaining the math to her and that yes we are both 18. It literally says on my friends ID \"under 18 until November 2013\". Even after pointing this out we received no apology, just attitude.  The food was great but the service really turned me off and I definitely won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"My family of 4 have eaten here twice now and both times my eldest son has hit the double bison burger and loved it.  We all enjoy the sweet potato fries.. They are so tasty.  My wife and I quite enjoy the chicken club sandwich on the softest bun ever.. Comes with avocado.. Mayo.. And lots of other tasty goodies.  I also had the ginger slaw (could use a touch more ginger) my wife had the corn and bean salad.. Sorry but it tasted canned.  Lastly my youngest son who is 18 had the Buffalo chicken cheesestake sandwich and loved it. The last time he had the fish and chips and loved them too.  I find the gravy a touch salty and the service was a tad slow.. Otherwise... The main meal was good.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Didn't even know about this restaurant even though it is so close to my home.  We recently went there with friends and the food was excellent.   Yummy pretzels!  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great casual Dining.  Good selection of food to try, Nice ambiance. I ordered the salmon burger which came with two sides,  salad and the red pepper soup.  The soup was delicious. The salmon moist and flavourful......  mixed greens, red wine vinaigrette, goat cheese, walnuts, green apple & yam chips. So yummy, need I say more. Staff friendly and bonus 5 min from home. Going back for sure."}
{"text":"Three stars is only because we were not blown away by the food. Service and ambience of the place was awesome! We started with the shrimp appetizer and that was YUMMY! My bf got the burger and it was okay. I ordered the teriyaki bowl and it was good just seemed like it was missing something. The menu was big so maybe we just picked the wrong thing for us that day. I'll definitely give it another shot when I'm up in Canada again!"}
{"text":"Been here so many times, as it's become one of my fav's!  Great service, fantastic food, great location.  Can't beat the price.  Love the lettuce boat wraps, it's the best.   All our friends love coming, and I hope it's here to stay for many years to come."}
{"text":"I normally love state and main but I have had 2 dissatisfying experiences now at this location. First time the service was fine but the food was bland and room temperature. Second time was today, had the worst service. Waitress was rude and extremely grumpy, until of course it was time for the bill to be paid. Was hoping for a better experience as I was so excited to get a State and Main in Airdrie. If you get a server named Mandi, run!"}
{"text":"It's my favourite! Best patio. Good prices and great options for sides. Expect long waits though on weekends!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  Very clean, nice decor, friendly staff and good food. Our waitress Kirsten was simply outstanding - kept checking in to make sure everything was okay. It is staff like her that help make the experience even more enjoyable. The fish tacos and calamari are very good!"}
{"text":"First time here and so far I am really impressed. Nice to have a restaurant in the area. The service was perfect and friendly. Really enjoyed the food. Especially the mud pie desert. It is a sports bar set up. It has potential and will be back."}
{"text":"We were so surprised to find out that there a waiting time for minutes on Tuesdays around 7pm. This place is very busy and certainly needs more waitress. The girls literally run to complete the order. We had wings, Cobb salad, baby back ribs, and calamari. Enjoyed all except calamari that first time were served cold! Without any apology the waitress made sure we will get a warm plate quickly , but I realized the chef simply doesn't know how to prepare them, they tasted raw:( we returned almoust full plate and no one bothered to find out what was wrong. They were out of Argentinian wine that we usually like , too bad no one looks after wine supply in such a busy place. But ambience is lovely and hostess making sure to accommodate you as much as they can. I suggest you reserve a table."}
{"text":"Well Calgary. I tried. I waited until a night where I had nowhere to be arrived. As luck would have it I had a few hours to kill before hitting the airport for a trip.   I trundled down the street to State & Main where (pre-oil crash holocaust) I couldn't get in here to save my life mid-day.   Now that the mind-bending Calgarian lunch hour is somewhat dead...I'm sure no one will have a problem with getting in here - any time of day.   Food - ugh. I can't speak for all of it but I saw 3 pizzas, tasted one and they were just gooey and not thought out. Pricing? Well, overpriced as in every aspect of the Calgary market - especially for what you get.   Service - now HERE please take note Calgary. There was a FANTASTIC bartender who waited on our table that was fast, polite and really great. I was thoroughly impressed by this as you rarely see it in this city. He's a gem and I hope they hold onto him because he'd have me coming back even though the food sucks.   Bevvies: Decent selection of beer AND they have my favourite Dark & Stormy so, I'm likely to go back for a drink at least. Definitely not a pizza."}
{"text":"We've been here twice for lunch as out-of-towners (once recently and the other time over a year and half ago) and have enjoyed our experience each time. Service was great & our server took the time to let us know over 90% of the dish components and sauces served in the restaurant were made in-house.  We particularly enjoyed the fact that each burger/meal came with a choice of two sides - allowing you to be healthy with a salad as one pick, and a little unhealthy with a starchy potato side for the other. Not to mention, the caesar salad side came with large bacon crumbles on top - an appreciated touch by this bacon lover! I went with a chicken club sandwich with a caesar salad & fries with gravy. My husband had the bison burger with a caesar salad & the jalapeno cheddar mashed potatoes.  We'd probably order the same things again - except this time my husband has to order his own fries so he'll stop stealing mine! :)"}
{"text":"We have ventured here on two different occasions now and for two different reasons; a nibble on the way to a movie just the two of us then four for a social afternoon of chatting and munching. The evening, Wednesday before a movie, was quieter than 2:00pm Saturday afternoon when the only seat was right at the entrance. Both instances we had service that was timely, accurate and friendly. Both times the food was exactly what we expected and in the case of the asiago bisque, better. We will be returning. Diverse menu, skilled staff and although the music could be more subtle the atmosphere is relaxing."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for a late night dinner. Decor is very modern. The bar side was busy because the hockey game was on. The dining side was pretty quiet.  It was margarita night for $7! I had the original lime margarita but it was not in a margarita glass sadly enough.  We started off with the calamari which was very tasty with spicy sriracha mayo on top.  I had the Gogi tacos which is the Korean pork with coleslaw and coriander and spicy mayo. My side was a Ceasar salad.  Very tasty.  My boyfriend had a enchilada. It was also very good. The service was excellent as well!  All in all it was a good place to go to watch the game or to relax and have a drink.  The food was good but not excellent to get a 5 star. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"server was great but the first thing we noticed was that our glasses were very spotty and misty, we let it slide as with the lighting it was definitely hard to see. we ordered the bruschetta for starters which was good, good consistency and didn't soak the bread. for out mains we ordered the cheeseburger and the poke bowl. the cheeseburger was extremely underwhelming, the \"brioche bun\" was in fact a slice from a loaf of brioche, the cheese tasted cheap and there was no bacon as advertised. the poke was o.k."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, had the beef dip with a choice of 2 sides.  I ordered it with the Caesar salad and fries.  Our server was quick and friendly.  It was a bit dark in there but not too bad otherwise if you sat near the windows.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Really good!! The onion soup and the tacos were both delicious!! And the service was good too... normally is really busy but when I went it was ok... so I had a very good time and I would definitely try it again when not terrible busy... the location is very convenient outside the mall ..."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, it's been very consistent. Had the Teriyaki Bowl it's a guarantee to be tasty! Also loving the Pretzel bites! Bartender is a Big teddy bear who is treating us great!"}
{"text":"Out Christmas shopping and stopped in at State and Main. We had a great meal, friendly service, and were in and out within an hour. No problem with the music, as it was fine."}
{"text":"My friend and I got some appetizers to sample together and our favourite was the bang bang shrimp. The food was decent, and the service was good."}
{"text":"Checked this place out last night with a buddy. Nice place, lots of TVs, good menu. Ordered the macaroni and cheese. It was really really good.   Lost a star in the rating because our server forgot to ring in the starters, but we aren't uptight pricks about things. We reminded her, she was really apologetic, got them to us and had them taken off the bill.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't have anything but good things to say! We went to have dinner and upon hearing there would be a 30 minute wait, my friend and I opted to sit at the bar. What a great choice!   We ended up having some appetizers. The Bang Bang shrimp was awesome! Not over cooked, super juicy and just the right amount of spice. We also shared the Dragon Boat Lettuce Wraps. Now, Joeys was my go-to for lettuce wraps...but now (shhh) it's definitely State & Main! They were not overly sauced or salty. The veg was still crunchy, and perfectly sautéed.    Our bartenders were fantastic and definitely made us feel like we were welcomed right off the bat.   The atmosphere was great too! Classy but casual...or something   Can't wait to head back. ESP since they have Stiegl Radler!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from the food at State & Main because, generally speaking, chain restaurants in Canada are terrible. (I'm looking directly at you, Kelsey's, Montana's, etc, etc.)  Anyway, I figured I should keep an open mind and I'm so glad I did, because the food was surprisingly (and shockingly) tasty.  I decided to go with the Main Burger (\"two patties, each w/ melted american cheese make up this classic. topped w/ lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle & our own state sauce\") and ordered Ginger Cilantro Slaw and Corn Bread on the side.  (Being able to choose from a list of side orders is actually a pretty great idea, and one that's quite common in eateries south of the border.)  It's a damn good burger. The meat, though a little on the dry side, contains absolutely no fillers and boasts an irresistible crust, while the various toppings uniformly work quite well. The bread was definitely too dense, but that's a minor complaint for what's otherwise a pretty fantastic hamburger.  The sides were also a pleasant surprise, with the Slaw quite flavorful and the Corn Bread unexpectedly tasty."}
{"text":"$5 beer, wine, and caesar's during happy hour.  My kind of place.  I had my first Caesar's here, and it had me hooked.  Where have you been all my life?!  Clamato juice makes Calgary's take on the bloody mary so much more delicious.  My only complaint would be the rather slow service - when it was time for me to go, I was waiting for my waitress to appear for about 20 minutes.  At times, it seemed like no employees were manning the floor at all."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great service, great food!  Lots of people on a Friday lunch hour.  It was bustling and very loud - a sign of a good restaurant!  I ordered the California Cobb Salad.  It had pieces of grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, mesclun greens, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs and a lovely balsamic vinagrette.  I enjoyed my salad very much!  My friend ordered the Chicken Tenders with an up-order of sweet potato fries.  She liked her meal.    I'll be back to try out other dishes in the menu!"}
{"text":"$7 martinis on Friday nights! Blueberry martini was the fav.  We ordered: Tuna tartare to start- best dish of the night Mains-  Fish tacos- tasty but not very much fish, mostly lettuce Mac & cheese- pretty good! Red curry shrimp- needed way more sauce   Dessert was allllright. Not a lot of options. Dirt pie was good.  Overall- Great atmosphere, fantastic service! Lots of tv's with all the games on, so good on sports nights."}
{"text":"I ordered some vegetables because I'm vegan.  All I was offered was steamed by the server.  I got a small portion with no seasoning. When I requested some seasoning, some sauce was dribbled very lightly on top.  The kitchen couldn't even put on enough or stir the vegetables to save the dish. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice decor, good location. I like the menu.  Both my kids liked their meals, a thumbs up from both of them, and they're both picky, so that's pretty amazing.   I thought the service was a bit slow and inattentive, but when a server did check in, they were all very pleasant."}
{"text":"Been here a few times as I meet with clients north of the city.  Last time, I was flying solo as I was burning time between meetings. It's a pub/restaurant/sportsbar...and they do it better than the other ones in the area.  They have their own brews - $5 all day and they're pretty good.  Their menu items are gastropub kind of upscale and there is something for everyone.  I chose the chorizo lasagna for lunch and though it was cheesy, meaty, pasta-y, I found it very salty too.  Well...you know what that means...more drinks!  :) Nothing here blows me away but it continues to be a steady place to go when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Hopefully this stays open in Chinook longer than the other places that have come and gone.     I ordered a reuben and it was tasty.  Not memorable, but it was a nicer lunch than the mall food court."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, at around 8:40pm.  Centrally located in Aurora right on Yonge Street with good parking.  We were advised it would be about a 20 minute wait as it was pretty busy.  We waited.  We were seated in approximately 20 minutes with a good seat.  Very comfortable.  Has a rustic high end feel to it... lots of dark woods.  Nice lighting.... but still had a good number of televisions for which we could watch the end of the hockey game.   There is a drink menu with an impressive number of beers available on tap.  They even have their own brand of State and Main beer.  The waitress offered to bring us some free samples to see if we liked it before ordering.  It was delicious, so we had some of the Blonde State and Main beer with our dinner.   We ordered Fish Tacos (which seems to be the staff favourite).   The fish tacos were fresh, and not over flavoured.  It came with a good amount of veggies and a salsa dip.   You could really taste the cilantro.   We also orderd the Gogi Tacos.... which I assume is named after the Korean Bulgogi dish.  They were korean inspired pulled pork tacos which I personally thought were better than the fish tacos.  You can order the tacos with any side you want, we got a salad with one and the jalapeno cheese cornbread with the other.   The menu has a good number of items that I would like to come to try.   I would like to come back and try more and experience more... so I feel the restaurant has successully accomplished it's mission."}
