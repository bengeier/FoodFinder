{"text":"The Cuban, Roman or Colombian with black sausage are amazing, their Empanada are also very good.

I frequently come and get takeout, and friends ask me to bring them sandwiches at work.

Best sandwiches of this type in Charlotte."}
{"text":"For a small deli/cafe, the food and staff couldn't be any better. It's the type of place where if you go every once and a while, you'll soon be part of the family. Auri and Eric are a wonderful couple and their love for good food is baked into everything they make. Normally one wouldn't expect to find great columbian food in North Carolina but this is as good as it gets without going straight there."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this restaurant and after countless times of passing by decided to stop by for lunch. Best decision ever! I tried all the empanadas ( don't judge me)  and the Cuban sandwich. Everything was delish! The owners are very sweet. So far I love living here in NC. ( moved from California a month ago) I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best mom and pop, hole in the wall place. Every time we are in town, we come to Lucy's! Empanadas are the best!"}
{"text":"I come here for a to go lunch once a month...been doing so for a few years.  I always look forward to it and am never disappointed.  As others have stated, once you walk in you know you are in for something different and the smell is wonderful.  It is places like this that makes one love food.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Delicious pastries. Very nice staff. Clean and welcoming. I recommend trying it, if you're in the area. A hidden gem. I enjoyed the beef empanada."}
{"text":"Great little family bakery with great pastry and juices.  The owners are so nice and passionate about what they do.  Can't wait to come back.  Really love their empanadas."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Haven't had anything I didn't enjoy.  The specialty sandwiches are awesome, especially the torigallo.  The owners are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"A friend from work recommended this place so me and my wife went to check it out. One of us had the venezuelan platter and the other had the Cuban platter, the platters were pretty much the same, one was with pork and the other beef, then the rest of the platter was rice, plantains, and black beans. Platters were $9.99 so reasonable and the food was good. The staff was very nice and helpful. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm Colombian born and raised in Miami, so my review has descent accreditation.  This is by far the best Colombian bakery I have been to outside of Colombia and Miami.  This is a 100% authentic Colombian and Venezuelan bakery. Stuffed arepas are to die for and so are all of the items they have.  Operated by the super friendly owners.  I've lived in Charlotte for one year and have been waiting to find something like this ever since.  This will be my new second home."}
{"text":"I just found this treasure. Sadly, I have been passing it for years. Absolutely delicious, highly recommended, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Authentic variety of tasty selections. The Cuban sandwich is the best! Good customer service. Our first visit and we will be back! I look at the sanitation rating wherever we go and theirs was a 100."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Stallings. Incredible service and amazing food, especially the Venezuelan arepas, cachapas, empanadas and teque√±os! I can't go a week without it."}
{"text":"You immediately feel welcome when you come in; this hidden gem has everything you need for a flavorful experience definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Yep a great find. Awesome cafe con Leche! Classic taste. Cuban sandwich is first rate, the best I have had in North Carolina. Big filling and hit, it was perfect. Lots of fresh sweets in the case, I did not get a chance to try but I will be back. Owners friendly and very nice. Perfect find!!"}
{"text":"Small low key place BUT  their Cuban sandwich is the best in Charlotte. If you are a fan of Cuban sandwiches make sure you treat yourself to one at Lucy's."}
{"text":"Great arepas!!!!! Had the Colombian enpanada and it was also delicious. Talk to the staff they have great suggestions on what to eat. 

Can't go wrong here with anything you order"}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful. It's very quaint and understated but don't let that fool you, the food is to die for. Lucy's offers the most traditionally prepared Argentinian food in all of Charlotte. I absolutely devoured my empanada and my Cuban sandwich. The services was wonderful, very friendly, and accommodating. The Maracuya was fantastic over all a really nice meal and a really great experience for a place almost in the middle of no where."}
{"text":"One day as I drove down Potters road, this place caught my eye. I was hungry; their signs drew me in. I stepped in to find my new favorite spot I now look forward to at the end of the week. On Fridays, I usually stop by to bring home 4 of their Cuban Sandwiches. Then Saturday morning, my wife and I usually get their arepas and empanadas. Man are those empanadas delicious. 

I definitely recommend this spot if you are nearby."}
{"text":"We tried Lucy's after I did a search of places in Stallings and saw all of the great reviews. It didn't disappoint! My husband got the Venezuelan platter and I got the Reina Pepiada. We also had the spinach empinanda. Everything was delicious!!! We finished the meal with the tres leches cake, and it was amazing. The owner was so nice and told us about all of the foods, what to try, etc. We will definitely be back. I want to try everything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Amazing little gem in Stallings. I am El Salvadoran and this place has me denouncing pupusas and starting a new religion dedicated to stuffed arepas. My SO had the Cuban sandwich and it was very tasty. Great owners, so nice and hospitable. Great at explaining the menu for the items I was unfamiliar with and suggesting things to try. I will definitely be frequenting this place. I'm in love!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across Lucy's while looking at bakeries on Yelp. I saw they served arepas and empanadas and decided to stop by. So happy I did. They are so friendly and the gentleman took time to tell me about some of their different items. The food was delicious and fresh.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A great spot. Venezuelan specialties as well as empanadas and arepas. We tried the beef empanada with both house made sauces on the side and it was excellent. We also had a cuban sandwich and Lucy's favorite, both of which were top notch. Eric was a great host and took time to explain all the different options. The restaurant is small and very well cared for. Skip the local chains and all the familiar spots and grab lunch here. There also serve breakfast all day."}
{"text":"Definetly the place to go if you want authentic Latin American food  !!! It's awesome !!"}
{"text":"Owners really care for your satisfaction and the Argentinian empanadas are delicious!  Definitely going to come back to try more!"}
{"text":"Great little hidden secret in an unassuming strip center in Stallings.  My husband, son and I tried it for the first time yesterday at lunch and will definitely be back.  The customer service was amazing and the food was great.  Good place to go to support small local businesses!"}
{"text":"A most pleasant place.  While most people give this restaurant five stars I am giving it four because I seldom give five  stars.  The food we had was very satisfying.  

There are four booths for sit down service.  This place is very clean which I appreciate.  The people are friendly and the food fresh.  I like to support small business and this place is worth supporting."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. I had a beef empanada, which came with an sauce. I also tried the Cuban Sandwich, BBq sandwich, and \"Lucy's favorite\" sandwich, all of which were to my satisfaction. I would also suggest grabbing a Yerba Mate Soda out of the fridge. The owner is extremely friendly and kind. He would come check on my table to see if we had any questions or suggestions. The only thing I can say bothered was a strange occurrence. When my friends and I sat down,we all started to have watering eyes. I don't know if it was because of something they were cooking with, but as much as we tried to ignore the burning sensation, we all tears running down our cheeks."}
{"text":"Authentic and amazing hidden gem. Love the platters with plantains and a pastry for desert!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Stopped in for my first time and tried an Arepa with pork and cheese.  Simple and delicious.  If this place was a food truck or open late at night, the lines would be crazy.  I can't imagine a more perfect hangover sandwich, so I plan on hitting it next time I have had a rough night.   The menu looks pretty impressive and I can't wait to try the rest of it out.  The hours are a bit limited, so look what time it is before you head over, but definitely head over."}
{"text":"Authentic Colombian/Venezuelan food that is prepared with the freshest ingredients, herbs, and spices. Owned by a lovely couple who enjoy engaging with their customers. Food is cooked with the passion and love latinos are known for. No bland menu items. Not salty either. Delicious and bursting with flavor. 

Although preparations and taste of certain items are not similar to my cultural puerto rican dishes, I still devoured what I ordered with mucho gusto. 

If you like a little spice, ask for their freshly made hot sauce. 

Have a sweet tooth, they also bake fresh everyday fruit filled puff pastries and more. 

Make it a point to try each of their fresh empanadas until you find the one your heart soars for. I hear the chicken empanada is a favorite.

Just be prepared to walk into a slice of Colombia and Venezuela where the food is cooked and tastes just like in one of their homes.

Bien provecho!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by another yelp elite at the last event we went to. 

My husband and I were out that way and decided to stop in for lunch. 

After waiting in line to order for about 5-8 minutes we finally ordered. I got an arepa stuffed with chicken, cheese and avocado and my husband got the Venezuelan platter which included beef, beans, rice and plantains. 

We waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. The owner could tell my husband was fading some so he brought over a complimentary bread (it had a name but the English explanation was tapioca bread) it was very good and so sweet of the owner to bring it over. 

The food came out hot and was fantastic!!!!

So fresh and so well seasoned. The owner and his wife do all the cooking. They are sooo proud of their restaurant and for good reason - it's honestly excellent!!!

This little hole in the wall is SO worth the trip and the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Eric and his wife always willing to serve. Had Teque√±os, empanadas de Pabellon, cachapas and cafe con leche."}
{"text":"The food here is great.The owner is very nice.I love the Cuba coffee. Great place nice and very clean."}
{"text":"Went here for Cuban and was a bit disappointed - the owners are very nice and sweet but the sandwiches missed with not enough filling and too much bread. I loved my material but the guava pastelitos were lacking in flavor- a little spoonful of guava filling and too much puff pastry . Overall not what I'm used to for Cuban ."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today after driving past for years. What a gem! Authentic Venezuelan/Columbia's food prepared to order by the owners. Good, friendly service, outstanding food and the owners take pride in their business. I had a Cuban sandwich, my wife had a Cuban platter and both were great.

Next time I want to try breakfast. Venezuelan and Columbia's specialties I've never had, but look forward to."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a small strip next to a Gas station is a little gem of a place called Lucy\"s Bakery. Very nice owner who explained his culture and his food items to us. Wonderful Empanadas and Arepa's . Such delicious pastries with Dulce and Guava ! Cute little storefront restaurant..worth the drive if you are in Charlotte But only open till 5 PM on weekdays..so come early!!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant ever!
It is my favorite. All the food in the menu is great, I recommend it 100%.
Eric and his wife are customer-focused and always make sure everyone is taken care of, it feels like home.
All the arepas, the sandwiches and the meals are delicious. 
The \"mil hojas\" is a must-have dessert. It is better than the ones I've had in Venezuela."}
{"text":"Everything is good at Lucy's: sandwiches, arepas, empanadas, sweets, even the coffee are something special.
The people there are friendly and accommodating and will explain the menu and make suggestions if you aren't sure what to order, but you really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"So friendly! Great service even better food! The empanadas are exceptional and the prices are more than reasonable. One of my favorite local spots."}
{"text":"If there were 6 stars, I'd rate it that! Try the Reina  Pepiada! Everything is fresh made and so delicious.  You HAVE to try this place! Eric is the best!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place.  I feel like when I was back home every time I came in..... husband and wife run this place. It's a perfect combination. Wife focus in amazing Latin American (Venezuelan, Colombian etc) comfort food and husband focus in latin carisma and love for you neighbor personality. They are so sweet that the food with their amazing service is like an unreal experience. I wish them their best and cant wait to come for some empanada and arepas for brunch Saturday."}
{"text":"We tried Lucy's based on reviews on Yelp.  We walked and our first thought was that the reviews were nuts.  It is most underwhelming in appearance.  Apparently, though, they chose to care more about the food than the d√©cor.  We both had arepas and they were amazing.  The proprietor was very patient and helpful in our selection.  If you have never been there, don't get put off by the spartan interior.  The food is well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Great Cuban sandwiches, empanadas, and the Torigallo is fantastic! This is my second time and it is definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Awesome food, a great change of pace from the regular local offerings.  The avocado and chicken arepa (reina pepiada) is great, Cuban and Roman sandwiches are to die for.  

My only complaint is that 6pm is too early to close, wish you were open later at least one night a week so I could pick up dinner on the way home from work."}
{"text":"Excellent Venezuelan style arepas. My favorite is the Reina Pepiada.  Owner is very friendly and helpful. Very casual atmosphere.  Truly delicious."}
{"text":"Great little spot. We stop in after going to the Y to grab some empanadas, and sometimes they have candy from Venezuela that we love. The people are wonderful....I always feel welcome. Last time I had an arepa sandwich con pollo y avocado. WOW! It was great....When we go to parties and need to bring a dish, we order 20-30 empanadas to take with us....nice presentation, and delicious. Great little place to stop by! 

Mike and Carolina..."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this hidden gem more. Ignore the strip mall location and step inside for the opportunity to try a wide variety of pastries, empanadas, tamales, arepas and more. I came in wanting to get a variety of things to try as a celebratory dinner for two and the owner was so kind and helpful and put me an amazing already with reheating instructions. Everything was good and you can tell they care. I will be back!"}
{"text":"\"As good as it gets\" is an understatement, it only gets better and better. My husband and I have recently moved to Charlotte and we've spent so many times trying to find a good Venezuelan spot, and finally this is IT! From the moment we went in we got greeted by a gentleman, very courteous and patient, we had no idea what to get. We finally ordered arepas and cachapas, however my husband made a switch from the chicken with avocado, to shredded beef with layered avocado. Needless to say it was devoured in seconds because it was SO good. I had a shredded beef arepa and a cachapa with cheese. The next time we went back, I ordered the cachapa with cheese and shredded beef. The food here is amazing, and I really can not begin to think that anyone else here would say otherwise. I spoke to the woman who made our food and she was so sweet and kind. They back you feel at home, and welcomed. Every time we go the food just gets better and better. If I can come here everyday, I would. Thank you Lucy's Bake & Deli!!"}
