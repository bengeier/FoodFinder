{"text":"Small but nice place in the center of Coronado. There were four of us and two of us had the daily special. The food was cooked well,However it wasn't impressive at all. We paid over $70 and my son only had a juice and a muffin. I was expecting more than mediocre food for the price. On the upside the muffin was good as was the service."}
{"text":"I took a friend to Sky Harbor for an early flight and was hungry. I yelped \"breakfast near Sky Harbor\"  and was intrigued by the reviews and menu. I don't live near this area, but it was only 11 minutes from the airport. What I didn't know is that it's only been open for 4 months. The owner told me there is a New Times review that was done on their 3rd day of being open. Haven't looked at it and no need now.  This place is great! The food (veggie and cheese omelet,potatoes,bacon,and sourdough toast were all really delicious and beautifully served. The interior and patio are warm and charming. The owner is as beautiful as she is nice and smart and that's saying something.  It excelled every expectation I had when walking in. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot!  Opens at 6:00 am.  Amazing breakfast and lunch! Awesome ingredients!  Local, fresh, family business.  Also they have amazing catering!  Great venue for a wedding reception!"}
{"text":"We came here first thing in the morning after a long night before flying into Phoenix.  Needless to say, we were in the need for a good meal and some comfort.  We used Yelp to look up breakfast and this was one of the places that came up.  It seemed to be a neighborhood spot and the neighborhood looked cute so we thought what the heck.  It was one of the best decisions we made  It is a mildly small cafe with an open kitchen just behind the order area.  The bakery display case has fantastic looking pastries and the like in them, if they were closer to the door I would never leave and just keep eating.  We ordered the arepas, shepards biscuit, one of their flavored waters (cantaloupe, honey and mint), coffee and a few pastries.  The arepas had just amazing flavor.  I think they were blue corn meal but the chorizo, sausage, scrambled eggs (if I didn't have a health issue, overeasy would have been better) with a side of their potatoes was so good.  Like a heuvos rancheros but way better.  The shepards biscuit was great too.  A fluffy biscuit, sausage, bacon, brisket with ricotta and eggs was just meaty, yummy comfort.  While their pastries were decent two, the breakfast was the star.  It totally made our day after a long night.  The chef and staff also treated our daughter like a princess and just placed smiles all over her face.  Thank you!  We will be back any time we are in the Phoenix area"}
{"text":"Their Shepherd's biscuits, and French Toast was the best I ever had. This is my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Beyond fantastic!  The  Mexican breakfast had the most amazing combination of flavors.  A gem."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch on a beautiful Spring day and enjoyed one of the most flavorful and beautifully presented meals I've had in a while. Charming location and great staff. The owners are extremely friendly and highly engaged in the quality of their business.  Great value. Highly recommended. Get in here!"}
{"text":"Tastiest omelet in town!  I love how this place is tucked away in the Coronado neighborhood. Has a great feel!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Duza's kitchen last week for lunch, and we were so blown away by the food and the freshness of the ingredients that we returned the very next day to further explore the menu! On this day, I had salmon with the farm stand quinoa salad in a sweet Thai chili sauce. My husband had the beet salad with the pan seared tuna. My favorite part of the  quinoa salad was the Thai chili sauce. It really enhanced the flavor of the salmon and everything else in the salad. My favorite part about the beet salad with the pan seared tuna was the incredible taste of the tuna. I have never had tuna that was so perfectly spiced! The next day, we returned for lunch and I had the Shepherds biscuit, which was lovely, and my husband had the vegetarian breakfast bowl, which  was also delicious! The next time we come here , I look forward to trying The pumpkin quinoa porridge! I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to come to this place when it was Astor House, unfortunately I never could with work but I was happy to give it a try with it's new inhabitants and I'm glad I did. Although I only stopped in for an iced chai and a bacon quiche on my way to the airport.   The iced chai had good flavor at first but the milk/syrup reduction wasn't cold so the ice melted quickly and watered down the flavor. Sad face.   The bacon quiche was delicious. I appreciate greatly the complexity that different herbs can bring to a dish. It wasn't a typical egg dish with some salt, pepper and paprika - I enjoyed having flavors like rosemary in there.   Service was friendly although we didn't interact much, the owner handed me my to go container, it was very wonderfully plated even in a to go box. I had a picture but must not have saved it!  I will be back to sit down and try a full breakfast, I have high high hopes for that.   Definitely go if you are in the area. I love living in the Coronado district, many sweet hidden treats."}
{"text":"I recommend this to all who love food, great people and an awesome atmosphere. The staff was super friendly. The cook cares about what he does, which reflects in how his food tastes. Superb! Presentation was perfect. We will be back and back again. Thank you."}
{"text":"The staff was very welcoming and friendly . Our breakfast was deliciously prepared using fresh herbs and seasonings and had us savoring every bite.  My husband enjoyed the patio seating which allowed us to eat outside on a beautiful day."}
{"text":"Over priced minimal food on your plate and the coffee tastes like a dog produced it.very small and close proximity seating. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really cool place we drove over here after landing from our flight and wanted a unique breakfast and not the egg and toast that you can get anywhere... Their menu is really cool and different the savory crepe was great but I wish they served two of them in the plate and not one its just too small of a portion as a meal, the nann with egg dish was great very tasty and portion was ok not too small or too big and the water infused with fruit is a nice healthy touch that we loved. Overall I would say it's a great interesting place for a quick bite if your not starving with fair pricing.  I would have loved to see the waiter and menu with bigger portion vibe or restaurant feel instead of the order at the cashier and wait for your food at a table kind of vibe but other then that this place is great and the menu is fantastic just didn't leave feeling fool..."}
{"text":"SO GOOD.  Have only been once but cannot wait to go back.  The menu is creative, perfectly seasoned/prepared, and presented beautifully.  A wonderful addition to the neighborhood.  Will definitely update this review after I've had the opportunity to try a few more things from the menu."}
{"text":"The omelette was great!   Very tasty.  Lots for vegetarians to choose from.   Not disappointed.  Friendly and cozy little place. A must to check out."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I have been here a couple times and it has been consistently fresh and delicious. They have a great patio area, service is friendly, and the food is awesome. It feels like you're having brunch at a friend's house. And their front patio is pet friendly as well. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant BUT have a real issue with their planning for the crowd. There is a 35 minute wait but there are 5-7 tables open. There are about 5 couples in front of us. Hmmm... Don't you think we could just be seated instead?. Luckily their food is phenomenal or my rating would be lower."}
{"text":"Love this place in the middle of the neighborhood. 15 minute walk had some lunch and walked home. The food takes simple dishes to another level. Never disappointed when we visit. Sat outside with our pup great lunch always amazing"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for something familiar but yet special this is the place for you. It may not be your first choice off the highway due to convenience but it should be.   We stopped on thanksgiving morning and were thrown back by the presentation and the flavors.   If you're lucky you will have  the owner tell you how she reinvented French Toast."}
{"text":"Wow. This new Coronado gem has beautiful, thoughtful and delicious food! My husband and I live in the neighborhood and came here for Saturday afternoon lunch. Each plate was innovative and yummy! While we both initially found the menu hard to navigate, the server was patient and guided us to dishes we both loved.   Must have: heirloom tomato sandwich."}
{"text":"Finally a Sunday brunch spot in the heart of Coronado.  If only we could keep this a secret from the whole city...the wait is growing.  But with the kiddo little free library right next door, and free infused waters, even the wait is delightful."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Place is off the path.  Great food, staff was very nice.  Chef greeted us.  Food quality was very good for the price.  Must go back soon."}
{"text":"Love the energy, ambiance and food!!! Had the house hash, arepas, and the savory crepe. Yum."}
{"text":"\"People who Love to eat are the Best People\"  It was our first time coming here and we originally came in for breakfast, however, we ended up getting lunch because their breakfast menu closes at 11 on weekdays. My boyfriend got the build your own sandwich with prime rib steak, with provolone cheese and topped it off with their chimchurri sauce. As for me, I got the pan-seared salmon. It came with this rectangular cracker and underneath it was this special white sauce (I'm unsure what it is) but it tasted so good with the cracker. On top of the cracker was seaweed salad, asparagus, and the salmon. All of the ingredients combined together was simply heavenly. Will come back hungry for more!"}
{"text":"Old world cuisine with a contemporary twist exquisitely well done. I would give more than five stars, if I could - bravo, Duza's! Your food is like good poetry!  My new favorite meeting place - what a find! The back yard is enchanting and provides a perfect ambience for a delightful chat with a friend."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Adorable inside and the breakfast was amazing! You have to have the French toast!! Great find and we would highly recommend. The owner was super sweet and she should be proud of what she has built!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Authentic, creative and tasteful breakfast and lunch! Options for everyone. I recommend the arepas dish, thought the vegetarian bowl as well as the tortilla with all in ;) my companions ordered looked and tasted phenomenal. Also, for those who love a sweet touch at the end of the meal, they have plenty of bake goods. You can also order a fresh squeezed juice with the fresh fruits of the days, I got a carrot juice and the apple tart for dessert. Private lot for parking is available as well as outdoor sitting. Nothing to complain here."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Has anyone talked about how awesome the bathroom is yet?  The bathroom is spacious and smells nice and has a great poster of a shirtless hottie across from the toilet.  The rest of the restaurant is pretty good too.  Cute little neighborhood spot, delicious food, super friendly service, and a truly open kitchen."}
{"text":"Good food that's different and interesting. Worth the visit to this quaint and cute place!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and got the arepas with chorizo, eggs, beans, and guac--absolutely amazing. My friend got the Mexican breakfast torte which was also excellent."}
{"text":"I went here this morning with high hopes. After \"discovering\" this place on yelp, it looked like a place I would love.. Unique breakfast dishes and close to home. The reviews were very favorable, so I gave it a try. It is a cute spot. You order at the counter and they will bring the food out to you when it is ready. I arrived early (Pre-7am) so it was not busy at all. I ordered the House Hash with eggs sunnyside up. The food arrived quickly. Like other posters mentioned, the hash was underseasoned. It had nice big chunks of meat, potatoes, peppers, etc, but it was just lacking in flavor. I rarely add extra salt or pepper in a restaurant, figuring the chef knows best, but I had to grab the shakers to give this dish some flavor. Another thing I found strange is that it is a breakfast dish (eggs, meat, etc) and it isn't served with any kind of bread or toast. I would expect a slice or two of a nice, freshly baked bread to accompany a breakfast dish like this.   And lastly, (and this is just a quirk of mine), as stated, you order at the counter and pay when you place the order. They ask you to sign your credit receipt (on the flipped around cash register tablet) and inquire about a tip before you even get your food or any real service.  I tip based upon the food and service, so how can I know how much I should leave. I gladly leave 25% or more if everything is great.. But I will also tip a much smaller amount if things are substandard.   Bottom line, I will come back again, but I will try a different dish that hopefully is seasoned adequately."}
{"text":"I don't like the service at Duza's! The food was good, the presentation was unnecessarily over the top. The wait staff argued about sending things back to be corrected. For example, we ordered the Shepherd Biscuit and the biscuit came with cheese-which the waitress tried to say was written on the menu. It wasn't. The menu details read: Buttery flaky house-made biscuit, applewood smoked brisket, avocado, italian (wasn't capitalized), sausage, creamy ricotta (a teaspoons worth), and the sum total of the avocado garnish amounted to an eight of the top of a butter-knife. The tacky way you had to stand at the counter to order and then pay before the food arrives, plus, include a 15% tip before the food arrives, really makes this place a joke. The flies didn't help either."}
{"text":"We are visiting AZ from MI and had gotten a recommendation from a family member to try Duza's for a great breakfast at a great price.  He was right.  My husband and I wanted an omelette and got one that was gourmet.  The omelets we selected were kind of a make your own and the choice we made was a typical ham/cheese and mushroom, but wait, it was NOT typical at all.  The ham was prosciutto, the cheese was goat cheese and the mushrooms were portobello.  Wow, what a difference it made.  I felt like I was eating at a swanky gourmet restaurant with the best fresh ingredients.  It was delicious.  Not to mention the surroundings.  Duza's is tucked away in a historic Phoenix neighborhood and one of those places that if you didn't know it was there, you wouldn't know it was there.  We ate on a picnic table in the cute little back yard/patio under the shade of one of the trees that gave the much needed shade over the various tables below. My husband is a bit of a fanatic when it comes to his coffee and for him to say the coffee was good, you KNOW it was amazing! I would give this eclectic little hole in the wall three thumbs up.  Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Solid local business. Very original recipes that taste great and the prices are fair. Has that friendly local feel where the staff and owner genuinely care about your experience as a customer.   I had a meaty hash, which really was loaded with meat and mushrooms. It was a little salty but delicious. I definitely hope to be back to try some of their other options and hopefully move them up to 5 stars.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem just outside of downtown Phoenix. The naan bread breakfast plate is incredible."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here this morning and it was the Best meal I've had since visiting Phoenix.  Until now, I thought this city had no soul.  This place changed my mind.  The service was equally awesome. Must come here again if I'm back in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Mm mm. This little spot tucked in next to The Tuck Shop delivers a casual, delicious order-at-the- counter/delivered-to-your-table restaurant quality meal. 7 of us were able to try a lot of the breakfast menu and the savory crepe was the highlight. Shepherd's biscuit didn't live up to expectations.  The cute patio would be idyllic In good weather. This iteration outshines the BBQ place it was before and is a better addition to the 'hood."}
{"text":"Delicious, creative and unexpected goodness with friendly, welcoming staff and a comfortable ambience."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited Duza's this morning for breakfast and I absolutely love this place! Very cute spot in the Coronado neighborhood with a beautiful patio. I ordered the savory crepe and it was so yummy! It was a light, fluffy crepe with a veggies in a creamy white wine sauce. My fiancé ordered the chefs special which was scrambled eggs with spinach mushrooms and two kinds of sausage on toast. The only negative thing I have to say is that I wish the orange juice was fresh."}
{"text":"The chef is fabulous, his wife Victoria runs the place and is a doll. Little Coronado gem with a peaceful ambiance and the food is top notch. Try the Giant Beans...\"I've never had beans that I wanted more of, they are just so good\" - my husband. A must visit!!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and unique combinations, a great little place for breakfast and lunch!! Got to try it out!! Excellent service!!"}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast along with my traveling colleagues and loved it! Menu was diverse, creative, and delicious. The coffee, even the espresso shots, were smooth and sweet. Mexican wedding cookies were also hit with our group. Staff was warm, helpful, and attentive. Many thanks for a cozy, delightful experience!"}
{"text":"Wound up here for brunch with the gang. Nice eclectic menu. Worth the wait... And wait we did! Almost half an hour from ordering at the counter to get it to the table. (Helpful tip: make sure you dine with conversationalists-as you will be waiting). Friendly staff, and huge portions. Get there before 10:30 am in the weekend if you can."}
{"text":"Duza's kitchen was a wonderful spot for breakfast! The food was amazing and even healthy. The atmosphere was comfortable and cozy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Little patio oasis in the urban desert, tantalizing menu with excellent follow through. Extremely affordable lunch options ready to go, can't wait to try the beet or asparagus salad next time. Outdoor seating is dog-friendly and a peaceful respite with picnic tables, shade trees, and distance from major traffic. Will definitely be revisiting for a healthy, filling, affordable lunch break away from the city grind."}
{"text":"Had the Shepard's biscuit this morning...amazing.  Great place that I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Savory crepe and the shepherds biscuit! The food was amazing. Both dishes were wonderful, the people were kind and the atmosphere and all around restaurant decor was very nice. All around great experience and great food for the right price!"}
{"text":"First time using yelp and chose this place to try...  parking was on the side of the business and across the street.  It was hard to locate enterance (thankfully someone was outside to tell us where to go)   Ordering is a la cart..the food was absolutely DELICIOUS! Great flavors.. I would definitely eat there again"}
{"text":"This place was great. The food is wonderful and though it takes a few minutes after you order (what good food doesn't?) it was worth the wait. I had a turkey sandwich and chips. The only problem is the place is very small. It limits the number of people who can come and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed breakfasts today everything was exceptional and we will be back the French toast was decadent and the service was excellent"}
{"text":"Love this place! Extremely friendly and welcoming staff. Came here for a birthday brunch and sat out back in the enclosed outdoor patio. They were very accommodating to my diet restrictions and their back patio reminded me of my old home in the Hudson Valley, NY. Eclectic relaxed vibe, delicious food, a great place to take it slow and enjoy company and surroundings."}
{"text":"The food was great! We had the Shepard's Biscuit, and House Hash... so good. The food was fresh and felt upscale, in a relaxed and trendy setting. I'm a coffee lover, and it was good  The only down side was maybe the service. After our order she never came back... had to ask for cream three times. Bummer. We'll go back for the food, and hope for better service!"}
{"text":"If you want an outstanding local option, Chef Mensur couples the most original breakfast menu in Phoenix with high-quality ingredients in this small restaurant that is smack-dab in the middle of the Coronado neighborhood in Phoenix.  I had the Shepherd's Biscuit Daily Special (always ask for the special when you order), a house-made shepherd bread surrounding sausage and bacon, covered with gravy and two fried eggs and another strip of thick-cut bacon.  Outstanding.  My wife had the Crispy Potato with asparagus, giant beans, and brussel sprouts with two over easy eggs.  Again, outstanding.  Don't forget to order something sweet from the display case - all pastries, muffins, cakes, etc. are made in-house.  Check out the Duza's Kitchen Instagram to see the chef's creative ideas and presentation."}
{"text":"Duza's is my new favorite spot for breakfast, specifically on days where I want to be productive- this is how you start it off right.   I have had enjoyed a couple of things from their menu, which is a fairly large departure from a standard breakfast place:   the Brussels sprout/beans/asparagus/egg how you like it bowl, the smoked salmon (they were testing it- may not be on the menu), a French toast confection (with banana bread) that oozed with fresh berries, and their stinking good infused water (I get what's in the pitchers off to the side). The bowl has been the most interesting so far because the giant beans have more flavor than I ever would have guessed. Best thing in all of this is that the menu reads like the food is heavy, but it's never felt like I ate too much/ate too much unhealthy food.   And the story of the chef is just cool. He used to be a chef at Phoenix Children's Hospital (I'm not sure if he still oversees it now) and I'm a sucker for people who work for children.   The service was shaky at first (we went in the first couple weeks it was open) but the staff is always warm, friendly and attentive.   So in a nutshell, if you're looking for a good place to catch an early breakfast without feeling greasy, come here!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS.  I had the potatoes/beans/asparagus/brussels sprouts/eggs. I don't know how the beans were brined, but they were outstanding. The potatoes were not crispy as described on the menu (not trying to be a jerk or anything - just being honest) and quite frankly, were undercooked and underseasoned, but overall, the dish was delicious. Cold brew coffee was great, too. Loved the vibe of this local gem. So glad I found them on Yelp for my one breakfast in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Top quality ingredients prepared well and served beautifully. Cozy atmosphere and an excellent back patio."}
{"text":"Bad service. Dirty tables. Flies everywhere. The reviews of this place are so good, but I honestly don't understand why. The portions are tiny and aren't flavorful enough to justify the prices. We got the house hash and the brisket sandwich both items lacked seasoning and meat. The sandwich was mostly bread and came with a side \"salad\". The \"salad\" was a piece of limp romaine lettuce. The table had food and spilled juice left on it from the people before us and it took 45 minutes for our food to come after ordering. Do not let the reviews fool you."}
{"text":"Omg! So delish! Great little spot with a different menu than anywhere else in town! I can't wait to try EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"Wonderful presentation and execution. Server was knowledgeable. Easy to miss if you're going for the first time, so look sharp. Lot of vegetarian dishes if that's your thing."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and looking for a Saturday morning brunch...for a party of nine. We called several highly rated Yelp spots only to be told they didn't take reservations or couldn't accommodate a party that big. Duza's said they'd do their best to take care of us, and they did.  This is a cool place with an even cooler menu. The waiter explained the entrees enthusiastically, leaving us with the difficult task of choosing from so many intriguing options. Between 9 of us we tried 8 different items, all of which earned rave reviews for taste, freshness, creativity and presentation. The chef came out to visit with us and seemed genuinely appreciative of our over-the-top praise.  Looking forward to our next visit to Phoenix and Duza's Kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"Very good!  Traditional food served in an eclectic way. I had the biscuit thingy breakfast. Not quite how I expected it, but very good nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Shhh. This place is one of a kind. High quality ingredients, unique dishes and great vibe. Tucked away in a residential neighborhood. Outdoor patios in the front and back. And great coffee on top of all this. Will come again next time I am in Phoenix for sure."}
{"text":"Presentation and taste are fantastic.  Ingredients very fresh.  Enjoyed a lovely brunch on Sunday of a savory crepe and came back three days later for prime rib sandwich.   Every day a fabulous new special creation."}
{"text":"I recently came in with a few girlfriends and we were very happy with our breakfast. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Great food and coffee, nice patio seating. Really good sour cream. We love going here for weekend brunches. But stay away cause I don't want it to get too crowded."}
{"text":"We had a group of 9 of us including one toddler and they were so accommodating! Everyone who worked here was so nice and the food was perfectly portioned and delicious. We basically ordered the whole breakfast menu and we are all very pleased with our meals. I highly recommend this sweet little gem of a place!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, Duza's...how I wanted to love you! First time here- love tuck shop so I hoped it would be a similar experience. Great atmosphere and food is AMAZING, but not a place for a quick meal whatsoever. Our 15 minute wait to order turned into 35 minutes...and we still hadn't ordered! Once ordering, we waited an additional 20 minutes for our food.  Great if you have a few hours to kill, but overall service is bad. Friendly staff but slow and obviously overwhelmed."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the chef was cooking openly in front of you so you can see his meticulous attention to detail and hygiene. Also, the ambiance was a very nice, small cafe setting. We had a nice brunch on our way to Phoenix airport. Cappuccino was delicious and served in a very large mug, European style! Order the biscuit with eggs overeasy, with sausage and bacon and garnishments...can't wait to go back when visiting Arizona again next time!!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. What can I say other than I will be back as much as possible.    The selection was great and has many vegetarian options.   Staff was VERY attentive and polite.   They will need more room as the word gets out about this place."}
{"text":"Today I'm having the shepherds it all looks good like always good service you have to come try this place out in. bomb bacon"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  It's a small casual setting and the staff was very friendly.  I had the Arepas - which was scrumptious, and a side of bacon - also scrumptious.  My wife had the Shepherds Biscuit which she also enjoyed.  It's a nice quiet atmosphere so you don't need your theater voice to have a conversation.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. Everything I have ever tried there has been top notch"}
{"text":"Such a cute location! Feels very homey. Staff was very sweet and welcoming. Food put me in a wonderful coma."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Stopped here after picking up my mom at the airport. I had the pumpkin quinoa porridge(delish!) And my mom had the hash...sooooo good! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Creative menu items that taste good. Small indoor seating area that's a little uncomfortable though. Fantastic lemon bars!"}
{"text":"This little spot is a real gem!  The food is innovative and absolutely delicious. If you are looking for a breakfast/lunch spot not far from the airport rental car facility this is your place!"}
{"text":"Had the French toast when I was in town for training and it was a nice small place in a quiet neighborhood. Food was amazing and staff was accommodating. Couldn't have been better"}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast.  Probably lunch too, we just happened to be there for breakfast.  You're not going to find the typical combination of eggs, pancakes, bacon, etc. like you would at Denny's.  Instead, Duza's has a neat menu with great flavor combinations and a nice use of different ingredients beyond the typical breakfast fare.  Their team is knowledgeable about their products, and very friendly too which just completes the whole experience."}
{"text":"Best place for a late breakfast ! They sell breakfast and lunch and it's amazing  all the flavors were very tasteful. The employees were such good company. Great whole in the wall place to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee or bring the whole crew! Enjoyed everything !"}
{"text":"Wonderful, little place. Went here with our friends and their two year old. Loved the breakfast food. Everything was fresh and was artfully plated."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our breakfast here. The biscuit and gravy was really great and the service was really good.  Would definitely recommend this place.  It's small but really good."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in quaint historical Phoenix neighborhood. Third time today and it is still amazing. Amazing taste. Amazing people amazing prices. I wish I could have my everyday breakfast here. Parking gets full so maybe I should try GR:D that has a bike stand right across from it."}
{"text":"Delicious European style food that was unique and tasty. They have gluten free bread and we're great at offering many dishes that were safe. I'm looking forward to nicer weather to take advantage of their beautiful patio!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Fresh food and pastries. Had the Shepherd's Biscuit and the yogurt parfait; both fresh, delicious, and prompt. A bit small, so no big parties."}
{"text":"Had the English Breakfast - it can with a tasty sausage, tasty potatoes and mushroom that were great! And the bacon extra crispy! I also had a hot chocolate that was yummy! I'll come back!"}
{"text":"You will regret every breakfast you've ever eaten after you try Duza' s Kitchen. Everything...EVERYTHING is killer"}
{"text":"The place is a bit hard to find because it's in the middle of Coronado neighborhood. The appearance of the restaurant isn't the best as of yet, however the food was delectable. I tried their Chicken on Ciabatta and boy, it was mouthwatering. I ordered Pork on Ciabatta and ohhh my Lord, I can't wait to go back again.  Just loving this little place with exquisite food."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot! Food delish and the presentation amazing. Owner/chef one in the same...Wow! Great coffee as well. If I lived closer I'd be here daily! Only reason I can't give it 5 stars is bc our waitress could've provided better service, had to ask for water, than silverware and more coffee. Other than that, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"Very hidden off oak and 12 street. Have to park across the street when busy but good choices and friendly staff. I have the prime rib on chibata which was very tasty but super filling. The bread was plentiful"}
{"text":"Absolutely great. The outside front seating area is pet friendly! The biscuits are so yummy. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite breakfast joint. The owners are very nice and their food was  beautiful and delicious and very easy on our stomachs. We had two different meals and both were amazing.  The price was decnt too"}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor patio; so pleasant! I ordered the Arepas, which is supposedly one of their top sellers. I liked the idea of using underutilized ingredients, such as giant beans. The chorizo was tasty, but slightly too spicy for me, which unfortunately prevented me from finishing my dish. Overall, my meal was good but not one that I plan to repeat. I would like to return, however, and explore the other menu items :)"}
{"text":"Great Food And Amazing Customer Service hands down The short Girl behind the counter was very nice and a lot of help on what was good on the menu I will continue going here for Breakfast"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here for breakfast.  After trying pretty much every breakfast place within a 5 mile radius of my house (I live near downtown), this has to be my favorite.  Lucky for me it's a short bike ride away in the middle of a quiet part of the Coronado neighborhood.  They don't have a huge menu, but they don't need to - the options are clever and very well made.  Then there's always a special that changes all the time.  I want to try most of the things on the menu, but then I often get grabbed by the specials.  There's a cool, laid-back atmosphere, with nice front and back patios.  The staff is always super friendly and attentive.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was super cute. The patio was great for pets if you live in the neighborhood and wanna walk your dog over. I loved the staff they were so welcoming and friendly. I ordered the mushroom crepe which was delish...I might substitute a diff cheese next time I go. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Had the shepherd's biscuit, ample food very well prepared and very nicely presented. Our first time there and already decided we'll make a return trip to try lunch. Outside seating makes this a really nice spot on these cool mornings."}
{"text":"Great food but very inconsistent in portions size. My brother in law and I got the House Hash mine with eggs over easy and his with scrambled. His portion was much bigger then mine, his scrambled eggs were much more then 2 eggs. Other then that great food."}
{"text":"Going out of my way to write a quick review of this amazing little spot that popped up in the middle of my neighborhood (Coronado Historic District). I've seen a couple of places come and go in this location and want this one to stay! The atmosphere is quaint (hasn't really changed since Astor House occupied the location) and it has an amazing back outdoor space which will be great with the nicer weather. The first time my husband and I went was for breakfast and the staff was very friendly. My husband had the Arepas and I had the Shepherd's Biscuit, both of which were delicious and the coffee was great also. We had our 9 week old baby with us out on the back patio and felt totally comfortable. We ordered take out for lunch for four people and not a single thing disappointed. The sandwiches are served open-faced and use creative, fresh, organic ingredients. The Farm Quinoa salad was especially delicious and the prices are extremely reasonable. Love that you can get a (great!) salad in a mason jar for $4.50. There's a juice bar I'd like to try as well as baked goods. From reading my neighbors' takes on their experiences as well on our neighborhood message board, it's obvious Chef Duzic cares about the community and is willing to take feedback into account. This is a great addition to the area and being just a few blocks away, we plan to frequent it often!"}
{"text":"Super delicious. Simple, elegant, fresh food. A new staple for me and my girlfriend now!"}
{"text":"In one word, delicious! Highly recommend! First time there and we'll make it a point to hit it again when in town. Fresh ingredients make the difference. We had the French toast and crab and shrimp benedict. Friendly staff as well. Be prepared to wait if you show up in a Saturday morning but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went here Sunday for brunch and it was awesome! I had the shepherd's biscuit and it was really good A biscuit topped with bacon, sausage, brisket, avocado and cheese. Add that they use very high quality ingredients and cook it to perfection, It has to be awesome . My friend has the crispy potato and she loved it. Service was really over the top, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Soooo good. This place is amazing, my husband and I when there for a brunch and food was so testy and service was excellent . We also order a coffee and it was so good.  Good quality food here.. I recommend it."}
{"text":"We went for lunch. I had the savory crêpe. Delicious! Seafood, with a wine sauce. Great neighborhood brunch and bakery. Also, they accommodated my husband's request for egg white omelet. The rosemary  potatoes were tasty. Sweet addition to Coronado neighborhood. Right on Oak/12th St bus line. Green rental bikes rack."}
{"text":"We enjoyed breakfast so much, we returned for lunch the next day.  Beautifully presented, healthful, scrumptious food."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and friendly service. The savory crepe was incredibly tasty. Would definitely recommend this little place!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal brunch spot.  Small business owner, local art for sale, inspired menu-artfully prepared, delicious selections.  Lavosh breakfast was tasty, as was French toast selections and crab Benedict.  Also the infused complementary water was amazing as was the almond bear claw."}
{"text":"Decided to stop into Duza's while visiting friends this week that live a short distance a way and boy were we glad we did! The space is nice and open and there is plenty of outdoor seating, it's even dog-friendly which we loved! There are plenty of vegan/vegetarian options as well as dishes for omnivores. Every dish was beautifully presented and the food tasted even better than it looked! It was slightly pricey, but about what I would expect for fresh, handmade food. I ordered the tofu scramble which was amazing, it came with an egg, but if you are vegan I highly suggest ordering this and just asking them to hold the egg. It is still plenty of food to keep you satisfied. My mom ordered the French toast and a Chai Latte with almond milk, she said it was one of the best breakfast meals she's ever had and didn't even feel guilty about the calories. Another friend ordered an omelette which she couldn't say enough good things about. Also, they have complimentary fruit-infused water on the counter which was super refreshing. The service was great and the staff was super friendly. All in all this was a great experience and I definitely plan on returning during my visit to try some of their bakery items!"}
{"text":"Wow..Again a AAA++++ Find.. Don't miss !! Oh yes.. the coffee is wonderful! Travel from far and near to find this neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Bad first impression. Young woman at register was unfriendly, harried, and forgetful. We had to re-request our pastries, which tasted like Costco bulk variety waxy pucks, after not receiving them with our coffees. The cappuccino came out as a foam-less latte.   That said, I am grateful to have a walkable breakfast venue, and we are excited to try the kitchen's other offerings. Update forthcoming. Thanks for betting on Coronado. Keep up the attractive hours. And promote that back patio garden!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place. Every plate and each bite is absolutely delicious. The ingredients are fresh, natural and organic and lots of gluten free to choose from The atmosphere is incredible and the people there delightful. Very professional, very clean, an absolute delight for anyone any day of the week!!! Officially my favorite breakfast and lunch place."}
{"text":"Wow! If you're looking for a unique breakfast, I'd highly recommend checking out Duza's Kitchen! It was my fiancé's birthday breakfast choice & without a doubt, he made the right call to go here.  We arrived around 9:30a on Saturday & were able to snag one of the two remaining tables. The restaurant is very quaint, not too much seating inside (additional seating outside), but they seemed to have an organized set up. Guests can add their name to a list and order at the counter when called for a table. It definitely seemed to save time since we received our food soon after we were seated, and we didn't have to worry about paying the bill after we were finished eating.  I had ordered an omelette with prosciutto, burrata cheese, roasted vegetables, & portobello mushrooms and a side of potatoes. My fiancé ordered the arepas with a side of potatoes. I liked how the omelette option was completely build-your-own style with multiple options of meats, veggies, & cheeses. They filled the omelette with a generous portion of all four and the combination I had chosen was really tasty. I enjoyed how creamy the burrata cheese was which was balanced out by the crisp veggies & fluffy eggs! The arepas were also very tasty. There were multiple components & the best bite I got was with a little bit of everything together. While the potatoes were cooked well & tasty, that side dish would probably be the only item we'd skip out on next time. The breakfast items were large enough that we didn't really need them & they were a bit overpriced.  Overall, we really liked the atmosphere of this breakfast spot & the food was very unique and flavorful. We will definitely make the drive to Central Phoenix again to eat here!"}
{"text":"I had one of the best omelettes at Duza! The garlic flower on top sealed the deal for me. Just delicious and not burnt like many places cook omelettes. The mushroom, spinach and onion were fresh. The side of potatoes were seasoned just right. There was a yummy side of guacamole. My friend had the cold plate and said it was one of the best she ever had. It included both smoke salmon and smoke trout. Kind of like a lox plate.  I still have to get use to the order at the counter service that is becoming popular these days. The food was served to us by very nice and efficient staff.  Also, when Duza is closed for the holiday seasons and summer, it would help to put the date on their website and voicemail message because you have no way of knowing why they are closed for two or three weeks at a time."}
{"text":"Nice quaint little spot in the Coronado neighborhood.  Soothing and relaxing vibes and very friendly and helpful waitstaff.  Me and my wife had the hash and flaky biscuit.    The hash was a little under seasoned but nothing a little salt and pepper cant fix but once all mixed together was a nice hearty good portioned breakfast. The flaky biscuit was very flavorful with the 3 kinds of meat and the egg with the biscuit hit the spot.  My wife wish there was some type of gravy so she could soak it up with the biscuit.  The biscuits were nice and fluffy.  Overall the meal was a perfect portion and cooked with a light hand and restraint.  The only underwhelming thing which saddens me to only give it 4 out of 5 stars; is the lemonade we had was more like water with a bit of lemon and no sugar and my wifes coffee was bitter.  Not even the caramel she added could save it.  But definetly a nice quiet nook restaurant in the Coronado area to check out.  Just an FYI parking is off of oak across from the tuck shop and the entrance is on 12th street.  It took us a minute to figure it out.  Happy nom noms"}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find, but so worth it!!! The food was so amazing! My husband had the hash with sausage and prime rib. I had the shrimp and crab benedict. Very light, bit incredibly delicious. The wait staff were very friendly and made you feel welcome. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Duza's is a quaint little joint in the Coronado Historic neighborhood.  - Staff is friendly. - Kitchen is immaculately clean. - Optional outside seating. - Atmosphere is very relaxed. - Potatoes were seasoned and cooked wonderfully, lots of thyme and rosemary.  - They have a couple vegitarian options.  Cons: - Drinks and Pastries are not on the menu that is given at the table but instead is hanging above the register. - If you do not eat pork for whatever reason this isn't the place to be, they rely heavily on the pork flavors to boost their dishes.  - If you substitute the pork for turkey, like I did, I received a snide remark (from another staff member who hadn't been waiting on us) about how I'm taking the best part off the plate. (This was suppose to be taken jokingly, but I felt like I was to be ashamed that I don't eat pork products.)  - My subsitute for the pork products (which were Jalapeno chedder sausage and bacon) was turkey and it was very very bland and was a huge disappointment and kind of haphazardly thrown on the plate.  Additional P.O.V:  My boyfriend enjoyed his dish (he eats pork) and said it was very flavorful and was cooked excellently. He ordered the Breakfast Naan."}
{"text":"I have a couple of close friends that help me iron out the world's problems over brunch and today's venue was Duza's.  The place is tiny but cute and welcoming.  We grabbed a table outdoors and commenced to catching up.  Just to set your expectations, make sure you get on the list to order as soon as you arrive, especially on the weekends.  They only have 9 burners so it works best this way.  Once we got the routine figured out, things went quickly.  We all had coffee and I ordered this yummy concoction of beans, eggs, brussel sprouts, and lemon.  My friends had an omelette, pumpkin quinoa, and a yummy jelly roll-type thing.  The service was great and we spent a lovely 3 hours catching up.  The prices are very fair and the menu is really innovative.  HELP small places like this become successful by allowing them to work thru their challenges !!!  Duza's is on to a good thing and I wish you well ....be sure to \"remain awesome\""}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and went with locals to this hidden spot. Awesome fresh food with unique mix of flavors. We all loved what we had. Delightful in every way."}
{"text":"Found it via YELP..,, extremely happy and very impressed with the operation. Small restaurant with gorgeous, clean open kitchen and busy busy Staff.  Unique menu items were amazing!  We'll be back... with friends!"}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood joint. The staff is kind, the coffee is on point, food will have you coming back and the location is ideal. So nice to mosey over on a Sunday morning and relax with a fantastic savory crepe. Outdoor seating in back and front. In door seating limited but there are people coming and going. Will be back many times."}
{"text":"This is my new MUST DO restaurant! I wish I could give it 10 stars!!! I would have completely missed it if I wasn't looking because its located in a residential area.   The atmosphere is relaxing and refreshing.  I ordered a hot chocolate and the omelet. The mug was massive and perfect to warm me up as we quietly watched out the window.  When my omelet arrived it looked like art. The presentation was beautiful and the taste matched the beauty.  What I enjoyed the most about the omelet was the taste of fresh, clean food.  You can tell the food is made with quality ingredients and care.   I'm not a morning person, but I would get up early on a daily basis just to come here. I will definitely add it to my regular stops and ensure any non-local visitors get to experience this place. Oh, and of course highly recommend to locals."}
{"text":"First of all...high props for being open on Thanksgiving morning (2015). We flew in from San Fran at the butt crack of morning and got to Phoenix at about 10am. after calling abut 4 places that were highly rated on Yelp and getting no answer, I tried calling here - WAHOO --open, open, open. We headed out from the rental car lot. This place is about 1.4 miles from the airport and it was busy but not crowded when we arrived. Parking was super easy, neighborhood is not the greatest, but not scary.   You order at the counter and then sit at a table, they bring your food out. We got the savory crepe which my mad LOVED, lots of sun dried tomatoes of yellow and red variety, with mushrooms and goat cheese. He thought he would prefer my order, but he loved this and kept it.  I ordered a biscuit with brisket, sausage, bacon, cheese and eggs. FREAKING delish!!!.    I want to give a a big shout out to the really tasty green iced tea  They were training a new server, he wasn't the faster but 't he was trying, so no worries....I was so happy to have a yummy meal in my belly before the long drive to Tucson."}
{"text":"A new place for brunch. Driving here was an unknown because you're in the historic part of the area and it looks like a neighborhood area. Just past the roundabout you'll reach a small parking in the back and more parking across the street.   We came in through the back door. The way to work this is order your food and pay first. There are tables inside, 3 outside in the front and plenty in the back. Water jug with cups are near the cashier.   For one cook, I think, the food took longer than usual but for the now part it was worth the wait.   Breakfast: savory crepe. Delicious creamy. Filled with cooked veggies like arugula, portobello, artichokes in a creamy mushroom sauce. $7.50   Lunch: The sandwich is made your way. You choose the meat, cheese, sauce, and any extras. Chose: Short rib, smoked gruyere cheese on an open faced one slice bread, with romaine lettuce, a side of red pepper sauce. Presentation on this was simple as well as the overall sandwich itself. $9.   Server: a put together server who offered to move the umbrella to block the sun. Thanks! Surprise dessert and a candle lit up twice by the same server.   Would come back again to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"If Breakfast & Brunch were a religion? Duza's Kitchen is the Cathedral.   The relaxed ambience of this place feels like your visiting family for a meal. The quality of the food is extraordinary and the presentation is just as stunning. In a word: Marvelous."}
{"text":"So amazing! I like the delicious crepe with mushrooms and artichokes.My friend like  chocolate cake here. food and service both perfect ,I love this place!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable breakfast/brunch/lunch spot. Interesting local art and very good food! Coffee was delicious; lots of pastries to choose from. Patio in back looks nice for cooler weather. Staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"What does a party of 4 do when wondering through an urban afternoon in the Phoenix Coronado District? Back patio outdoor dining  for the House Hash at Duzas! It's worth your time. If you can't find it, look closely for for a place that looks surprisingly like your grandmother's house. You can easily miss it on 12th street but that's all the better. This place is a hidden gem and will stay that way until Guy Fieri finds it. The people are super friendly. The food is super good. Not up for House Hash? Hit the Butternut Ravioli, the Crepe or settle in for some French Toast. Don't expect normal.  I like the Village Inn just as much as the next guy for a quick filler upper but this is pallet pleasing right through the coffee and mocha."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in Coronado!  Walked from our house a block or two away and had a wonderful experience.  The staff is welcoming and super friendly.  The savory crepe is to die for.  I'm craving it already, and I was just there this morning.  We didn't order the French Toast, but we saw it at the next table and it looked amazing.  Will definitely order it next time.    Really nice patio in back and it appears the front patio tables are dog friendly.  Always a plus in this neighborhood.  Please come out and support this new, local business in the hood!"}
{"text":"Just posted a pic of their intimate patio! Great food and fun little spot in the neighborhood! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wish I lived here to come here often. The service was  good and fast. Great menu, cute ambiance, and amazing food. Fresh, organic ingredients."}
{"text":"Went there this morning for b-fast with friends. Very good coffee, beautiful food/plating, great food (at unexpectedly low $$ for this kind of place), decent service (although you have to order at the counter), and clean decor.  They have really cool outside sitting but it was pretty cold outside (for my taste) so we sat inside.  It fills up quickly so you'll want to either come in early or have a trendy old blonde woman stare at you to the point where you'll want to leave asap so she can take your table.  I had the eggs with asparagus, giant beans, and potatoes. Friends had various dishes with meat, all raved about them. Before I left I saw and got (and couldn't resist) Italian savory crackers/pretzel thingies, a salted caramel cupcake and a cannoli to go.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Awesome little breakfast joint. Open kitchen, small dining area but you get to see everything going on. Reminiscent of a Cali beach town restaurant. Food was really good and found out that the owner was serving us at the end of our meal. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Just dropped in based on local ratings. This place was amazing!  All the ingredients were incredibly fresh, the atmosphere was laid back but clean, and the service was friendly and genuine. We didn't expect such taste and presentation, but were blown away with what we experienced. Regarding price, our party of three just flew in from Chicago, and for what we had, we would have expected to pay much more. Well done!"}
{"text":"I usually don't review a place until I've been there 3 times. Maybe it's the \"3rd times a charm\" idea. This place is really good. The main reason it's good is because the food is real and fresh. I can see, know and identify every ingredient I'm eating. That matters in our family. And it's tasty! You can see the chef cooking your food in a very down home way and you can tell he cares about the food and his restaurant. I'm currently watching him clean and put away dishes."}
{"text":"Great place and amazing food. Fresh and healthy. The chef cooks with love and the plate comes in a very nice artistic look. A must try place for breakfast."}
{"text":"How do you describe this delightful,wonderful neighborhood oriented bistro?! The staff is very friendly,greeting you as you come in the door and not rushing you when trying to decide on what you want to try, remember your name, checking frequently if you need or want anything,the portions are more than enough to satisfy any appetite, the choices are only limited by your imagination.Never being a fan of quinoa before I am now especially mixed in with those breakfast potatoes...yum.The breakfast sandwich I had was the special of the day and is enough for 2 or a take home meal for later. And the desserts  and bakery items are so numerous that it's hard to make a decision..I will be back frequently to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Unique twist on typical breakfast fare.  I got the Arepas which was a total hit. The ambiance was interesting as well - walls covered with local art.  They offer cozy indoor and outdoor seating options too.  Love this place for the local, Coronado flavor.   Will definitely bring people if they're looking for a taste of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food! I want to emphasize that again, GREAT FOOD! The brisket sand which is sweet and tangy, must try.  The eating space is small and the parking is across the street, which make it a little inconvenient, and is the reason it gets four stars overall because the food alone is definitely worth five."}
{"text":"Duzas is located in the old Coronado neighborhood in the corner spot formally Astor House.  It looks like a small coffee shop from the outside but offers plenty of seats inside, and a patio both in the front and in the back.  The hostess was very friendly and made some excellent suggestions.  We ordered assorted french toast with mascarpone cheese, house hash, a savory crepe, a couple of muffins, and yogurt with fresh berries.  We sat on the patio out back and listened to live acoustic guitar and enjoyed the weather.  Very nice place to relax and enjoy the cool weather.    We shared all of our dishes and all of them were amazing.  The best was the savory crepe.  Seriously delicious.  Mushroom cream sauce covered crepe, filled with mushrooms, arugula, artichokes, and roasted bell peppers.  So savory and so so good.  The house hash was also excellent.  Fingerling potatoes, smoked sausage, smoked brisket, prime beef, with peppers, onions and eggs.  I really enjoyed it.    Now I'm more of a savory/spicy fan but the french toast was really good for a sweet dish.  The bread was banana nut and some other really good pieces and it was covered in a fruit sauce and covered with cheese and fresh fruit.  If you like french toast I am sure this is right up your alley.  The muffins were good and the yogurt and berries were fresh.  Duzas is serving wonderfully delicious, fresh and savory food at a reasonable price and with a warm smile.  I all about all of that and can't wait to go back and try a few other items on the menu.  For a town lacking in excellent breakfast options Duzas fills a large void and fills it extremely well.  Highly recommend you add this to your bookmarks now."}
{"text":"Wow can you say amazing. Wanted everything on this very enticing menu.  The chef without doubt knows what he is doing and is a master at it!  My entire family ordered something different and tasted all and ALL was incredible. What a great vibe both inside and on the very cool patio of this old house in the Coronado district. I cannot wait to go back....If you want a wonderful enjoyable dining experience Duza's Kitchen is a must...."}
{"text":"Excellent menu, outside the box dishes done perfectly. The taste combinations are out of this world. Had the Naan bread, Crab Shrimp Benedict and the apple crispy hot cereal - all great!"}
{"text":"We came in on opening day to support the newest restaurant in our neighborhood. We had been hearing about it for a while, and got a sneak peek at the menu so were very excited to see if the food lived up to expectations set by the menu.  It does!!  Take a chance on this new place, it's worth it."}
{"text":"We visited this place based on recent Yelp reviews. The food & service were excellent. Our 1st visit was breakfast and the arepas & shepherd's biscuit were so delicious that we vowed to come back the next day to try some lunch offerings. So, we returned the next day & had a couple of ciabatta sandwiches - one with kettle chips & one with the romaine wedge salad. Again, the food was delicious, artfully presented & reasonably-priced. Great patio & staff!"}
{"text":"Ok.  Wow!  This is an excellent and much needed breakfast addition.  The breakfast dishes are unique, thoughtful and beautifully presented with \"just right\" serving sizes.  Ingredients are fresh and high-end.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great environment! Would recommend this to anyone who is in town! There is something for everyone and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Currently our fav breakfast spot in town! Check it out, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was soooo good. Got the house hash. Perfect savory breakfast. Service was friendly and attentive. It's counter service but they still made it a point to walk around and make sure everything was going ok. Awesome addition to the Coronado neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food great and 5-5 special was outstanding.  Do watch the walkway, caught my foot squarely between gravel \"driveway\" and sidewalk.  Fell down, embarrassing, and could've sprained my ankle.  Grateful I didn't!"}
{"text":"The food and coffee are great! Expect a wait if you come on the weekend but it is worth it if you have time!"}
{"text":"Met friends here for a yummy breakfast. This delicious meal started with  prompt service, a great cup of coffee and lots of choices for a vegetarian. I settled on the Vegetarian Scramble and I was not disappointed. Very fresh ingredients with a beautiful presentation. For some reason YELP had the wrong opening time so I called and they were open at 6 am not 9."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast or lunch. Fresh, unique and yummy!   Prices are good and food is great!"}
{"text":"Great food great service great price the atmosphere is fantastic yeah fit what I callour home grown culinary aficionados"}
{"text":"This is just unreal.. fresh, FLAVOR...one of the best meals and bang for the buck you could ever hope for!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding, absolutely outstanding.  Came in while visiting Arizona and found it on Yelp. The restaurant and charming and unassuming but this is a true hidden gem.   The ingredients were fresh and delicious with a beautiful presentation. Creative menu that made me want to order one of everything. Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, welcoming the second we came through the door.   This is easily one of the best breakfasts I have ever had and I will absolutely be back the next time in Phoenix. If this spot was back home in Chicago the line would be out the door.  Highly recommended, truly a great dinning experience."}
{"text":"This is casual dining at its best!  More things to try next time.  Great experience for solo diner or group.  Also outdoors eating."}
{"text":"Just about the cutest little neighborhood breakfast restaurant I've ever been to.  I love going out to breakfast, but if there is a line or it's super crowded, it kills the whole experience.  Duza's is perfect.  The decor is super charming, with little jars of fresh flowers, antique furniture, coffee house tunes, delicious food, and friendly service.    They offer counter service, which is just fine for me.  When the weather is nice, they have lots of great outdoor seating in the front and back.  You have to try it out."}
{"text":"Duza's is seriously THE CUTEST! Unfortunately I was in and out quickly and just picked up an iced latte and OJ to aid in my morning buzz, but I cannot WAIT to come back and eat here, and of course update my review based on their delicious eats. I would also totally come back to this cozy spot to work someday. My latte was delicious and their fresh squeezed OJ was also a winner. I asked the chef what a cool looking yellow/purple fruit was on their counter and he cut it right open so that I could taste it! It ended up being a rare melon and was so delicious. Talk about 5-star service!! You can definitely feel the passion when walking through the doors of this great local business. See you soon, Duza's!"}
{"text":"So many breakfast spots, so little time.  The Phoenix breakfast scene kills it and I love this neighborhood spot.   If you want to pretend like you live in a small town where everybody knows your name, have breakfast on Duza's patio. Walking up to this place, I feel like Lorelai visiting Luke's Diner ... and I've been one time.  The omelets are perfect for those wanting a healthy brunch. Sometimes, I order a \"table pancake\" at other breakfast spots. It's literally a pancake I make everyone at the table share so that I can indulge, but in a sensible way. Of course, we all still get our own breakfasts, so it's not too sensible. Actually, it's more like, let's all be fat together. Yay, carbs! But when I don't want to do that, this is the spot. The omelet is delicious enough on it's own. Not that you can't indulge here, because you most certainly can. Crispy breakfast naan bread anyone?"}
{"text":"This is such a great place to come and have brunch. Located in a neighborhood it's tucked away almost to where it looks like someone's house. The Chef takes great pride in his work. Every dish is like a piece of art. They also have great pastries and coffee. I highly recommend, and will be back next time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for Brunch. It was so unique and felt so authentic! I really enjoyed the food. It was new and different. It felt fancy without a fancy price tag. I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"It was Valentine's Day but the long wait was NOT the issue.  The food was good, but was not as described on the menu.  On the menu it states that the french toast has : blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, mango and mascarpone cheese.  So it was a no brainer and we ordered 2!  Yet we got ours with only blackberries and blueberries.  When we called over our (rude) waitress, she took it as an attack.  When I asked for some Tobasco she told me it was already on my table.  When I asked my wife if it was on the table the waitress said (loudly), \"What???  You don't believe me?\"  If anybody is reading this from Duzas, I was in on Valentine's Day around 11am and the waitress was wearing a red top with little tore up shorts that showed more than enough skin to be inappropriate.  Sorry...won't be back!  Cozy place but rude service!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious food, and the staff is very friendly and attentive! 4 stars instead of 5 due to the lack of good air conditioning; but they are closing and making some changes for the next 3 weeks, so hopefully that's part of the plan. Will definitely be back again as soon as they re-open!"}
{"text":"This quaint little restaurant located in the Coronado Historic District is a hidden gem. I ordered the crepe (both the breakfast menu and lunch were available) with delicious mushrooms and artichokes. The presentation was awesome as was the crepe.  I shared a layered chocolate cake with my friend that was light and delicious. There is outdoor, private seating available with a misting system. The restaurant has local art that adds to the ambience. There are bakery items and crustless quiche available too. I will return because this chef really knows what he's doing and I want to try the polenta w mushrooms next!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I come here for great breakfast. Bomb French toast, smoothies and the like. Although the drinks are slightly over priced my only gripe about this place is the ability of the short cashier girl to follow my directions for the order. She's either can't hear well, doesn't like her job, or is just sadly dumb. The staff overall is polite and in a hurry. This is a classic hideaway brunch spot for all ages."}
{"text":"Me likey!  It would seem that the Coronado neighborhood's wildly popular Tuck Shop has finally landed a neighbor with staying power.  On the southeast corner of 12th Street and Oak (about a mile north of Banner University Hospital), I found this little breakfast gem on Yelp after waking up waaaaay too early on a Saturday morning.  To my delight, this place opens bright and early at 6am on Saturdays.  As I write this, they've only been open for about two months, but first impressions give me plenty of reasons to smile (as well as make future stops here).  If you're coming here, I'd strongly recommend biking if you can.  You can use a Grid Bike Share bike to get here as there's a Grid Bike station around the corner, or you can park your own bike here.  If you're driving here, I'd park around the corner in the open lot across from Tuck Shop on Oak Street (note: park in the lot with 90 degree parking, not the one with 45 degree parking).   The setup is not too dissimilar from that of Vovomeena (which ironically enough is Tuck Shop's sister restaurant).  A small space where you order at the counter and seat yourself.  The front seating area only has room for about 20 (including a pair of counter seats).  I didn't walk towards the back, but I do believe there's seating in the patio out back.  I just sat up front this go around.    The menu here is pretty quintessential breakfast and brunch fare, but the presentation is surprisingly elegant and the ingredient mixes are pleasantly complex.  And as with many popular CenPho and Downtown establishments, the ingredients are sourced locally.  I was in dire need of a protein boost for my morning breakfast and one menu item caught my attention.  The Shepherd's Biscuit.  A house made biscuit with applewood smoked bacon, Italian sausage, smoked brisket (yes, brisket), avocado, ricotta, and eggs your way.  Yet seeing some of the photos of the breakfast portions on Yelp, I was a little worried I would leave still hungry.  So I got a side of sausage links as well.  Total cost for the food and glass of water came to about $11.  Came out to my table in just over 5 minutes.  For starters, forget everything I said about small portions.  One look at my meal will settle that question.  Aside from being pleasantly surprised by the portion, there was the presentation.  Instead of a biscuit sandwich piled high, it was an open faced biscuit with all the trimmings and with a very sophisticated presentation.  As for the taste?  You betcha.  Granted for some this might be a bro too far on protein, but this was just what I needed.  The brisket was a great added bonus (no its not like Little Miss BBQ's brisket, but nothing is), and I really liked the way the avocado and ricotta toppings smoothed out the otherwise juicy and powerful meat flavors.  I can't tell what cheese they put on the on the biscuit itself (brie perhaps), but the biscuit was warm and plenty moist.  A great meal to start of my morning all around.  Ah, but there was an unexpected surprise just as I was finishing.  The waitress came by and plopped down a small breakfast quiche-like concoction compliments of the chef.  A fluffy biscuit like texture on the outside that was stuffed with potato, cheese, and bacon and with a variety of herbs to boot.  Now THAT'S how you make it to 5 stars on Yelp ladies and gentlemen.  The counter staff and wait staff alike were both upbeat and friendly my entire visit and the food was fantastic.  Great experience, great value.  Very happy to see this spot find some new life after several failed attempts by previous restauranteurs to make this space succeed.  Based on my experience, I'm optimistic this one will work out for the long haul.  Tuck Shop has worked for years now as a terrific dinner spot.  It was high time they got a next door neighbor serving equally worthy fare for the breakfast and lunch crowd.  Coronado folks, that spot has arrived."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time today. My wife had the pumpkin quinoa porridge and although it was tasty, a little larger portion would have been more filling. I had the chef's breakfast special, which consisted of BBQ pork ribs, eggs and hash browns. The hah browns were a pleasant surprise as they were more flavorful than other breakfast places. My portion size to price ratio was fine at $14, but my wife's was $11 for a small bowl.  The menu is varied and interesting. The food was good. The staff was friendly, but the waitress offered a refill on water and coffee and then had to be reminded about it.   Overall a good experience and worthy of a repeat."}
{"text":"Fav new breakfast spot right in Coronado! Be prepared to wait for greatness, as you could possibly wait about an hour for food sometimes. The service is sometimes hit or miss and my orders haven't always been right but whatever.   The only big peeve I have is with the insane amount of flies on the patio and the lack of bussing and wiping, so it just makes it even worse. The 2nd best part of Duza's is the patio (#1 being the food obviously), please do something to make it more bearable!"}
{"text":"The only word I can think of for this place is 'bizarre.'  Let me start with the good: nice location, nice menu, good prices, good service, cool bathroom.  Now on to the strange: the first thing I noticed was a service cart that had a cleaning bucket filled with liquid, some dirty rags, a busing tub, and cleaning spray chilling right by the door and right next to a couple who were eating. Not only is that just gross, it's also a health code violation. I've worked in restaurants, and that kind of stuff is a) never supposed to be near customers/out in the open, and b) never supposed to be near food.   Then there's the kitchen set up. Everything is set up in a line and out in the open. The cook line is right next to the dishwasher and the place where dirty and clean dishes are set up, which are literally right next to the cash register. It's great if you want to know who's making your dish, and I think on some level it creates some kind of accountability; but it also means that the restaurant is loud 100% of the time. The dishwasher's going, dishes are clanking, cooks are yelling, etc. Weird vibe.  Also weird: the fact that the cooks, the dishwasher, and the servers couldn't tell what dishes were clean or dirty. We were sitting inside, and as we waited 45 minutes for our lunch (maybe due to the dish debacle?), I watched one woman take out dirty dishes from a dishwasher tray, then a waitress went up to her and asked if the dishes were clean or dirty--the woman didn't know, so the waitress got frustrated and told her to pay attention. The dishes went into the dishwasher after it was deemed they were dirty. Then the dishwasher left out a crate of dirty dishes, a cook came and asked if they were clean or dirty because he needed a pan, no one knew, so he took one anyway. The dishwasher came back and said they were dirty, and put them in the dishwasher. Then, she left out a carton of clean dishes, and other people started stacking dirty dishes on top of them because they didn't know. If she was new, it was a rough first day; but someone should have been keeping tabs on that. By the time we got our food, it was lukewarm and just okay.  Based on the reviews, we were really expecting a great experience, but Duza's just didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Based on other YELP reviews and scores, I scheduled this place for a breakfast business meeting. Everything was FANTASTIC!!!  Great environment. QUALITY and PERFECT food and EXCELLENT service."}
{"text":"Went here with friends on a Saturday morning for breakfast.  We got there about 11- 11:30 and had to wait about 20min to order.  The place has a really nice open, clean and friendly feel.  The food was excellent and the service super friendly.  We had the Shepherd's Biscuit, Assorted French Toast and the special of the day which was empanadas.  It was all excellent!  We had a group of 3 and fit fine, but I don't know if they'd have room for a party bigger than 5 or 6."}
{"text":"First time here, came on recommendation, glad I did! Food was excellent. For sure coming back for the Hash."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST IN PHOENIX by a mile. If the heat isn't too harsh, we enjoy our breakfast in the peaceful back patio.  My favorite dishes include the crab benedict which has a cold hollandaise sauce. I have no idea how Chef Duza doesn't break the eggs. So tasty! My second favorite dish is the savory crepes. Life doesn't get much better than this. I'm also hooked on the specials and order them about 50% of the time. Always so creative and tasty. The coffee is top notch and service is outstanding. They always remember us and we have great conversation with the lady at the counter."}
{"text":"Wow great find, just flew in and wanted a quick healthy breakfast. 5 mins from airport. Owner and Chef is a licensed nutritionist adding value to each meal. You tell him what you want and he cooks it with health in mind.  Mr and Mrs Duzas local family run converted house restaurant. Fresh healthy or not so healthy food, your choice. Omelettes are the best I have ever had. Friendly greetings and great customer service. If you are a coffee snob you will enjoy their locally roasted beans."}
{"text":"Love this place. Tucked away in a Central Phoenix neighborhood. It's a tiny little house. Offers many unique dishes for breakfast breakfast and lunch. The water is flavored with fruit. My favorite dish is eggs over medium with brussel sprouts, asparagus, potatoes, and big beans. So delicious! I get it every time I go."}
{"text":"We are staying at a BNB a couple blocks away and found this gem.  What a truly wonderful little place to have breakfast.. I would give this place 10 stars if I could. Freshest offerings with amazing presentation. Unique mixes of wonderful ingredients.  Ate twice just because I've never had a breakfast so good. If you don't stop you will miss an great experience. Sit out back in th open air!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, excellent service. Great atmosphere! The polenta breakfast was delicious. The kids loved the quinoa porridge and the apple crisp oatmeal and yogurt parfait. My son-in-law loved the arapas, and the vegetarian breakfast bowl and the shepherds biscuit were also a big hit."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new place for breakfast and new dish and Duza's was the first place that populated for Yelp. I initially had a little trouble finding the restaurant when driving over, there are no significant signs from the street as it's in a residential area. It's a small quaint place, I was instructed to order first and there was open seating, I sat outside while waiting for my food. Be forward, the flies are very aggressive, ugh! Lol  The service was good and my food came out within a timely manner.  I ordered the Mexican Breakfast Torte, it was between that and the french toast and glad I took the cashiers advice, b/c it was amazing! The flavors and spices blend very very well together, along with the salsa provided on the side. I don't usually take breakfast leftovers home with me, but I didn't want to leave a morsel of food behind, lol.  I will definitely be back to Duza's, it's hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great yelp pick after arriving in Phoenix! We had breakfast on Saturday morning. Not too crowded but well  attended. My hubby said this is one of the best breakfasts he ever had. The eggs are so light and fluffy!  All ingredients are fresh. Fresh herb garden on the patio! Only draw back is a lot flies on the patio, too be expected with great smells outside. We will be back but will eat inside. Ver satisfied!"}
{"text":"Our breakfast was amazing. Well thought out dishes, foodies like us appreciate that. Also love that it's in Coronado and their little back patio is nice and quaint. Hope Duza's stays in business for a long time! Great addition to the little corner on Oak & 12th St."}
{"text":"It was good not great. The prices were higher than I expected from what Yelp said. 899 for breakfast and then another $2 for potatoes and your coffee only gets one refill and the cups were rather small. The service was a little slow we had asked several times for a child seat. I'm not sure if I will go again but I definitely love The  Tuck Shop next door."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and both times it has been spot on.  First time I had the special of the day which was a unique approach to a Benedict.  It was more Florentine style and had a homemade ravioli with it that was just perfect.  The second time I had the beet salad with the prime rib sandy.  Both were delicious and paired well together.  The ice tea is just terrific and so is the coffee cake.  Great little spot, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went for an early morning breakfast yesterday, and my expectations were highly exceeded. Such a great addition to the neighborhood, I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Duzas is AMAZING! Everything I've ever had is delicious and with a sweet Julia Childe quote at the entrance you know they bring the ruckus when it comes to food. I love to eat and they love to cook... A match made in heaven! Get the French toast. Soooo good!  The staff is extremely friendly, everyone always greets you, even the guys behind the line expertly crafting food! Come in and support this local eatery that is of the highest order and quality.   Eco friendly side note: I'm the only one on the back patio and they have misters going. Water is precious guys and were in the desert lets not waste it to drop the temp a few degrees eh?  Anyways keep up the great cuisine-ing!"}
{"text":"Yes. This is what Coronado has needed all along! A good breakfast and lunch place with delicious coffee and pastries and local and organic food that is flavorful and delicious. The portions are amazing for the price. That bacon is legit. The French toast? Out of this world...Straight up dessert with giant real berries piled high. The service is good, though if they're busy be prepared to wait a bit. Worth the wait though! Kid friendly and walkable if you're in the hood. Definitely making this place my regular jam."}
{"text":"I had the seared Ahi for lunch so devious can't wait to go back and try something different! Amazing food, friendly staff and good quality, fresh and healthy love this place"}
{"text":"This place is a great place, cute, fresh food, great service, nice cuisine, but I am very disappointed with the Arepa dish. I went specifically to try it. I just moved to the Coronado Neighborhood, and I was so happy to find that this place across the street has Arepas on their menu. It doesn't have anything to do with what an Arepa taste or looks like. It is not even a variation. I was hoping to invite a lot of my Venezuelan Friends to enjoy the Arepas from the menu, but it won't make sense. I still like the place, the food and coffee, but don't go if you want to have Arepas."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, warm atmosphere & extra friendly staff! Highly recommend coming by for breakfast! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing new neighborhood place to grab a unique breakfast!  We stopped in yesterday and ordered right away...love that there wasn't a wait for a weekend breakfast like other places in town.  The staff was very welcoming and efficient.  We tried the breakfast naan and shepard's biscuit...both were incredible - fresh, flavorful and completely made to order.  We will definitely be back to this hidden gem and enjoy our breakfast on the back patio once it cools down."}
{"text":"Amazing,  fresh food.  I stopped in for breakfast/lunch while in the neighborhood.  I had the crispy potato bowl,  which comes with an assortment of vegetables and two eggs.  The bowl has the best fava beans I've ever had.  They also serve fruit-infused water, I tried the coconut,  lime, and strawberry water.  I highly recommend this hidden gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for brunch yesterday after our hike. The space was really great; there's a patio out back that's well shaded and very cute.   The food was good. My husband ordered a hash that came with brisket and it ended up being a freshly cooked steak with small potatoes and shallots; much fancier than I expected. I ordered the naan plate, which was fine. Good tomatoes, which could have benefited from salt, on what seemed like store-bought naan with well-cooked eggs. It didn't need the hummus but the hummus was good.  Service was welcoming but it took a long time to get our food. Just come with a book, enjoy the atmosphere, and don't be in a rush."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick breakfast before stopping at the Heard and Phoenix Art Museums nearby, I landed at this homey yet contemporary spot in the historic Coronado neighborhood smack dab in the middle of Phoenix. It really does feel like a residential area with wide roads and a heavy mid-century vibe, so as I was driving on North 12th Street, I was hard pressed to think I would come across a fully functioning restaurant. Sure enough, I missed it twice before realizing that Duza's was in what looked to be a converted, brick-laden home.  It was cute inside with baked goods in a display case (photo: http://bit.ly/2u8jtqJ) and just a handful of tables, one of which luckily freed up just for me. I liked their slogan: \"Great food is not fast, and fast food is not great. Judge after you eat, not while you wait.\" It seemed to be an implicit message to Yelpers who prematurely ejaculate their reviews before finishing their meals. Both breakfast and lunch sides of the menu looked thoroughly appetizing with the Farm Stand Quinoa Salad and Ratatouille (both $5.99) sounding like healthy temptations reasonably priced.  I decided to splurge a bit and ordered the $10.99 Vegetarian Breakfast Bowl, which really wasn't a bowl but a full breakfast plate with a couple of poached eggs, a thick slice of gluten-free toast, grilled tofu, and a hash made of butternut squash, crimini mushrooms, and chopped asparagus (photo: http://bit.ly/2pr2xWT). The yolks were just runny enough to satisfy and the bread was both crisply textured and impossibly soft, but the hash was the true high point with nice umami flavor. In fact, I barely missed the corned beef. Oh, who am I kidding?  FOOD - 4 stars...as good a vegetarian hash as you can get AMBIANCE - 4 stars...compact but homey and comfy SERVICE - 4 stars...very attentive, especially with the coffee refills TOTAL - 4 stars...keep healthy by coming here for their tasty dishes"}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to Duza's Kitchen because their food is fresh and delicious, their staff is patient and helpful, and the artwork is a nice added touch. I woke up Thanksgiving morning, craving brunch that I did not need to make. Luckily, Duza's Kitchen was open.   I ordered the House Hash ($9.50) and the Arepas ($8.50) but it was such a tough choice because everything on the menu and the daily special sounded so tasty. I was not disappointed in my decisions. The House Hash had chunks of hearty meat with savory mushrooms, and the arepas were light and not dry. Best part of this place is the quote from Julia Child \"People who love to eat are always the best people.\" So true Julia.   What I recommend: - House Hash"}
{"text":"High quality fresh ingredients, attentive staff, nice atmosphere, reasonable prices, great coffee, delicious dishes.  Will be back to try more of what they have to offer soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Serves a unique combo of flavors I haven't found anywhere else. Can never go wrong with the arepas - blue corn cakes - but everything is truly good here, with beautiful presentation! The space isn't the largest, but they're very accommodating. When we arrived with a large group of 10, they sat us on their charming back patio and agreed to take our order sitting down to not disrupt the flow up front."}
{"text":"OMFG. Came in on an early flight and was starving, looked for a breakfast spot with a decent rating on our way to our hotel and we totally scored. This place is not only adorable with a casual calm atmosphere and a great patio but the food is fan-freaking-tastic!!! I'm only in town for a few days and almost think we have to come back, it's THAT good."}
{"text":"Kinda underwhelming. Went for Saturday morning brunch and got the Shepherds biscuit. Sounded interesting but ended up being flavorless and disappointing. Ordered a latte and it came out lukewarm.  Plus I'm so confused with the way you order here. You give your name at the cashier and then wait to order and get your seat after. Probably makes sense when it's really busy but when it isn't it's just confusing. And the employees didn't help explain it much to us, who were obviously confused. It's a beautiful and fun space, I'm just a not excited about the new tenant."}
{"text":"Although I've been here a dozen times this is my first review simply because I wanted to keep it a secret. This is truly a small intimate dining experience. We are greeted when we enter (been here enough they recognize us) you order your food then get a table   The chef is aware of all the customers the food come fairly quickly and we have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little restaurant tucked away on 12th St and Oak St. Immediately, we were greeted with smiles and friendly staff. I love that the chef is pretty much just in the open...not hidden in the back somewhere...so you can watch him building his creations! I shared the Mexican breakfast torte with my fiancée -- it was one of the larger items, enough to share. It even kept us full all the way to Sedona and on our short hike! It was flavorful and had the perfect balance of spice. This brunch food is not overdone -- it seems to be classics done with the right twist, without going overboard. I hope everyone gives this place a fair shot!  Oh and I loved their latte. The coffee definitely was strong enough to get me going at 6am on a Saturday, without being so bitter that I needed sugar...I need to find out where they get their coffee beans from.  I will definitely be heading back! There is so much more on the menu I need to try. And don't forget about their pastries too!!! And check out the cool art they have -- currently it's by an artist who works with acrylic + epoxy."}
{"text":"My first time here and I loved it,  for brunch the prosciutto asparagus omelette over toast, it was amazing .....the desserts are fantastic too"}
{"text":"Real food! Great people. 6 course meal on fridays. BYOB It's really cool! You have to call few days ahead to put ur name on the list. I try to go every Friday. And that's how it looks like"}
{"text":"Quaint little hidden gem. Very pleasant setting with plenty of enclosed patio seating, and an open range kitchen, which demonstrate passion if you ask me. I've only been in for breakfast, but I'd certainly like to come back for lunch and try a few more of their items. Everything is prepared from scratch and you feel right at home, which is great if you're just looking to have a nice breakfast or lunch with someone. I had the Shepherd's Biscuit, which is a biscuit with melted white cheddar, brisket, pork sausage, topped with avocado and a creamy ricotta, paired with two eggs any style. The sausage had a nice kick to it, just a hint of spice, and the biscuits were almost toasted for a nice crust on the bottom. They also do coffee and espresso drinks, and have some freshly baked pastries available if you're on the go. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Amazing little place tucked away in a friendly neighborhood. Great service and awesome back patio. Enjoyed a family breakfast with three amazing dishes... I had the scramble house hash with beef, ham, and Brisket. It was on point!  One of my daughters had the assorted French toast... OMG... a different and refreshing take... three different types of bread (banana, cinnamon, blueberry I think). Well put together and not overwhelmingly sweet.   My other daughter and wife had the shepherds biscuit... buttery, light biscuit was the highlight with a nice blend of bacons and sausage!   We shall be back!"}
{"text":"Duza's never fails. Duza's is always the right choice.  Everything at Duza's from the pastries, sandwiches, and breakfast options is simply amazing. So much love and attention goes into the preparation of every single dish, and you can see it and taste it.  I love their Ceaser salad. So simple and so good, make sure to opt for that when ordering a meal. The French toast is perfect.   Just try everything!!"}
{"text":"If you want a REAL Central/South American meal in Phoenix, this is your spot. By the way, it is 3 miles from the airport so easy access whether you're getting in or are on your way out of Phoenix! It is located in the Coronado Historic District which has some cute, colorful (adobe?) homes. Actually a lot of businesses here, this one included, look like homes as you drive by. It's a very cute and quaint area, away from the hustle bustle.  Firstly, let me just say - what a cute entrance. Blue exterior with an orange door. This place had my heart before we even walked in. When you enter, the place has a very homelike feel. We got a table right across from the chef working and we really enjoyed the smells and sounds and watching him work!   For drinks, I got a drip coffee and my friend got an almond milk cappuccino. Both were excellent and I scarfed down my coffee in a minute or so. The lady waiting on us was so sweet and refilled my coffee several times and gave my friend free refills, too!    Deciding what to order was HARD. There were so many excellent options. I was craving an arepa so that's what I ordered. They had it with beef and chorizo, neither of which Im a fan of, and they were nice enough to sub in really, really great chicken instead. The arepa was AMAZING - it was open-faced with the meat, giant beans, salsa, and vegetable on top of it and was made of thick, blue corn. I think the giant beans get a special mention - Ive never seen them before, but man oh man, were they flavorful and zesty and made to perfection. I loved the tomatillo and red salsas that came with it as well.  They had a lot of great looking desserts and baked goods that we didn't have room to order, especially since this was a pre-hike meal. However, I am definitely coming back here (and already excited about it) when I'm in town next!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch today, and everyone seemed pretty happy with their selections. I had the crispy potatoes bowl, which had beans, Brussels, and asparagus-- the veggies were tossed with this really yummy herb dressing. Eggs were a perfect over medium, and presentation was nice.  Hubs got the torta, which was a total mess, but he definitely enjoyed it! Over all, everything was pretty good, I did feel this place was a tad pricey and cramped."}
{"text":"I think I am in love.    Saw the reviews on Yelp and wanted a good breakfast. I got it. To heck with that Whole 30 diet, when you are faced with an Arepas, a mammoth migas on steroids can mad.  I will definitely be back as there are several items on both the breakfast and lunch menu that look awesome.  The service is simple, plenty of outdoor seating. All in all, a keeper."}
{"text":"Easily the best breakfast spot in the Coronado!!!  Great food, great prices, and awesome staff!!!"}
{"text":"Quaint little place in the Coronado District.   Repurposed older house with nice patios front and back.   I parked across the street just north of the restaurant (could use a sign or two for us first-timers) and walked around to the front, though there's also access in the rear.   I ordered the arepas on the recommendation of our server and wasn't disappointed.  The coffee was good as well and the self-serve aspect was nice.   So while not great,  it's certainly very good and very local.   I recommend visiting if you're in the area."}
{"text":"What a gem! We intentionally came to have breakfast here after catching great images on Instagram. We had build your own omelet (spinach, portobello mushroom, prosciutto, goat cheese) side of potatoes, Pumpkin Quinoa Porridge and Crispy Potato-asparagus-bean-brussel sprout Bowl. All three dishes were absolutely delicious. I was most surprised by the vege bowl we added bacon to it, which was perfect. It was better than I expected. The staff was friendly and helpful and place was very clean.  We couldn't resist and bought baked goods on the way out. We can't wait to come back and try more of what's on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Totally will come back again, recommend everyone to try it. Costumer service was really good. We order the bisque seeped and chorizo torte, both very delicios!"}
{"text":"I was waiting for a perfect 5-star place to do my first yelp review. Duzas has top notch food, friendly people, and awesome service (food came out within 10 minutes, they checked on us twice, and offered a coffee to go). A couple runs it (one Bosnian, one Mexican) so the menu is really eclectic.. Difficult to pick one thing! I had the Arepas (first time) and they were made with black beans and delicious! My fiance had the house hash and also really enjoyed it. Thanks for a great experience, Duzas."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. Great food wonderful ambiance. I would move to this area just to have Duza's in my life."}
{"text":"Was super Awesome fresh food. Was worth the drive from west side of Phoenix . Everything was delicious ... everyone needs to try it."}
{"text":"Although the food was delicious and the ambience was lovely, we were really upset with our service. Our waitress was very cold, disdainful and made faces at us. We did nothing to upset her and weren't sure why we treated in such a way. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhweeee! What a find! Pulled up the ole yell. Typed in breakfast. Drove into a tiny lot in a neighborhood and walked out a happy happy family. Didn't know what to expect for counter service breakfast. The place is cute and you walk by the chef cooking. Once I totaled my bill I thought, this mom and pop place better be good. We had our coffees and walked out front. Small but cute and near the street. We let the kiddo run amuck. I went to the restroom to wash my hands and found a back patio that was enclosed and well decorated. So we took a bench out there when breakfast came I was flavor blasted. I had a blue corn biscuit thing with eggs and yummy salsa. The other was more of a sweet bread and marscapone egg dish. I ate 90% of both entrees. The kid ran around and didn't bother anyone! It was Perfect! Chef killed it. We will def be back."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  And just what the neighborhood needed.  Pro-tip:  walk by the pastry/muffin/cold item counter towards the back of the restaurant before ordering your meal.. There are a ton of delicious items that get missed when you beeline for the counter"}
{"text":"My buddy Matt Bartlett (owner of Granite Dude) says he can't get enough of this overnight oatmeal, so I'm giving it a try. Looks pretty darned good Let's see how it tastes"}
{"text":"Wonderfully friendly, prompt, attentive service. Fantastic food from a varied menu! Try the pumpkin quinoa porridge or the Parmesan toast w asparagus prosciutto & parmesan cheese omelette. And don't miss the homemade apple cake. You can't go wrong!  We highly recommend Duza's."}
{"text":"The food here was very good! I had ordered the Shepard biscuit and had a side of potatoes. My friend ordered an omelet with her choice of what went into it. Everything tasted great and the people that work there are very nice."}
{"text":"Food was upscale and delicious. Service was quick. Great atmosphere, cozy and hip. Thank you!"}
{"text":"WOW! This place is absolutely amazing! I ordered the oatmeal, with apples and almonds! BEST EVER! I mean it is amazing how used to eat crap I have become. My wife had the omelet, the only regret I have is that I didn't order one also!! The parking is a cross the street and we got here right at 6am so we beat the rush!! We will be back"}
{"text":"Delicious. Local. Fresh. I absolutely love supporting an independent business that is serving such delicious food."}
{"text":"I've eaten there once, and I'd have to call the breakfast one of the very best I've EVER had.  (And dude, I'm 67. ) I got the make-it-yourself omelette.  Eggs, perfect.  Filling (two cheeses, prosciutto) almost indecently good. My friend, also a first-timer, said the same about his breakfast. I'll be going back anytime in in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Really cool, out of the way place for a gourmet 5-star breakfast in a coffee shop environment.  This is a down-low place with upscale food.  Everything tasted fantastic.  The portions aren't too big which is very refreshing.  Just enough, but you don't have to overeat to clean your plate.  Everything is also artfully plated.  The parking can be a little confusing and you could end up driving right by it because it looks like a house in a residential district.  All of this just adds to the appeal and the feeling of being a hipster at a speakeasy.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great cafe right next to Tuck shop. There are two outdoor seating areas, a back patio and a front patio. The restaurant is in the Coronado area and has a neighborhood feel. The food was flavorful. We went for brunch. We had the arepas and Naan breakfast dish. Overall the food was good. The juices are not to be missed.  I would say it's a great staple brunch place to put on rotation."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has so many great reviews, I tried it because of them. I spent more than $40.00 for breakfast for two. The outside atmosphere was kind of nasty actually. There was a broken-down piece of kitchen equipment sitting on a rickety old table and covered with an old tarp. The outside lighting that is supposed to accent the landscaping was broken. No one bothered to fix it and it was just laying as if nobody cared. The Masonite patio covers are warped and in disrepair. The table that held the water was broken, the water dispenser looked cloudy and dirty. The coffee and water tasted odd.. My toast which was made by them placing the bread on the grill tasted rancid. The potatoes also tasted like they were cooked on a grill that had not been cleaned in a long time. All of our food tasted odd. Just gross. The bill, although I saw that most of the menu items are priced separately, I might have been less disappointed if the experience was good. This was not a good experience and I will never go back. I don't care what the pictures of the food look like. The taste was awful."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast and it was great. The food was well crafted and delicious. I had the Arepas and the flavor was incredible. The service was well attentive as well. I highly recommend this spot for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Small authentic and original spot. Definitely worth the visit. Friendly staff and good food.  I would recommend the Shepherd's Biscuit!!!!"}
{"text":"This little place was awesome. Excellent service,  atmosphere, and food. Came here a week ago with my girlfriend for breakfast and I ordered the Sheppard's biscuit. Everything was perfect. Also ordered a lemon bar afterwards which was also b-o-m-b tastic!!!"}
{"text":"Not only is it in walking distance from MI casita but the breakfast is BOMB! They usually have a daly special  the shef has on display when you walk in and there's a chill spot in the back."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place in the Coronado - have been there three times now.  Each meal has been wonderful with the exception of the eggs.  If you have a breakfast/brunch place you would expect the chef could properly cook an egg.  If you order over easy you get sunny side up (this has happened three times) and once the white of the egg was still clear and raw - just couldn't eat it.  My daughter ordered poached eggs thinking that couldn't get screwed up, but she got one egg that looked like it had been fried, it was flat and the yolk fully cooked, the other on her plate was only slightly less cooked - these definitely were not poached.  Maybe we'll try scrambled and see how that goes. That said, the menu is creative and it seems to change a little at each visit.  The food is plated very attractively and the ingredients are fresh.  Prices are pretty reasonable for a nice breakfast that is not your run of the mill stuff.  There is outdoor seating which I love, but as stated in the other reviews the flies are a real problem.  Don't know what you can do about that though.  Service can be a little slow sometimes, but it is prepared to order and is worth the wait."}
{"text":"What a welcome break from the run-of-the-mill brunch places! We flew into Phoenix for the long weekend and were certainly not expecting such original, delicious, and fresh food in Phoenix. I had the savoury crepe, which was outstanding, while my husband ordered the veggie and crispy potato bowl, which was very good as well. Even better was the charming hostess who gave us helpful tips about our travel plans and generally set the mood for the Memorial Day weekend. Absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"I was looking for a local place to eat and I found a gem!! The staff was extremely friendly and inviting. The food was crazy good!! The atmosphere was calm, hip and comfortable, it makes you want to take your time, enjoy the moment and savor every bite. I couldn't recommend a better place to go. I will definitely be back when I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I end up in Phoenix once a year for a conference, and while I'm rushing to grab a quick breakfast most of the time, on my way out of town, I get to enjoy myself a bit. Duza's is a great place to do just that. I wanted something hearty, and so my server recommended the breakfast lavosh (or lavash, as I see it spelled more often). It was delicious--a thin, unleavened bread topped with eggs, peppers, mushrooms, Canadian bacon, sausage and more. Fantastic flavors, portions that were spot on, plated attractively. Exactly what I wanted before I set out on the road.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating. I prefer indoor seating, but when I arrived, there were no two-tops available, so I had to start outdoors. But...they remembered my preference and shortly thereafter, asked me if I wanted to move inside. I surely did, and that attention to detail is unusual and commendable.I look forward to returning next year for my post-conference relaxed brunch."}
{"text":"First time here. So far it's amazing with a great staff, food and drinks. It's B.Y.O.B with a market near for your mimosa or ro?e."}
{"text":"This is a gem! Beautiful, delicious, artisan food prepared on the spot with the freshest ingredients. Delightful, friendly atmosphere and located in a lovely neighborhood. Yummmmm. The best staff and namesake chef too. Worth the drive from Tempe for sure!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast. I ordered the hash and it was delicious. I sampled a few other friends's dishes and theirs were equally great. Great outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"Duza's Kitchen it's considered by many as a hidden gem around the downtown Phoenix area.  Our experience overall was good but not great or excellent. The food was great! Good portions but in my opinion nothing \"special\" or to \"die for\". However, it is at least worth to try once.   What killed our experience was the waiting time. We were told that there was a 20-25 minute wait once we got to the restaurant and we were okay with that. What we didn't know was that we were going to be standing for the 25minutes when there were clearly lots of tables open.   My suggestion is to let customers know there's going to be a wait, but if you have tables open, at least let them sit and order drinks... that way customers don't feel like they actually had to wait for 25 minutes. In my opinion this is a problem that Duza's could fix with a bit more organization, they definitely have the staff to pull it off.  I wouldn't mind going back again, but I would probably call ahead of time to know there won't be too long of a wait."}
{"text":"This was a very good little restaurant. The waiters and staff were very fun to meet and we were offered advice on how to reheat food when we  got home for our leftovers. I suggest their French Toast or their Pumpkin Quinoa Porridge. I enjoyed the portion size and the family atmosphere. I'd suggest just going with the water as the restaurant is tiny and it is extremely hot. Their coffee is just okay, but the water has a hint of fruit in it, which was simply refreshing."}
{"text":"This is by far the best review I have ever given a restaurant anywhere.  I have never eaten a meal here that I did not absolutely love.  In fact, I don't even look at the menu any more, and haven't since my second visit.  Instead I order whatever the daily special is, and yes, I'm bummed if I get there late and they have run out.  (That has only happened once, and the dish I ordered in place of the special was every bit as good.)  Check out Emil R.'s review for a bullet-pointed list of the wonderful things about Duza's.  The only thing I would add, which I realize is a personal thing, is that I never add salt to whatever dish I am eating.  I trust this chef so completely that I would not dream of altering any of his dishes, and I have never said this about any other chef or restaurant, so make of that what you will.  If he serves a dish with eggs sunny-side up, then that is how I eat them, no questions asked, even though I'm usually a scrambled egg guy.  Okay, you've been told by me and other capable reviewers how really good this place is, so get your butt in gear and go ASAP!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will definitely return. Three thumbs up!  My boyfriend and I each got two plates and coffee and it was about 40 bucks.  We shared the Cold Plate (smoked salmon, smoked trout, cheese lavosh, cream cheese, capers- lox and bagel esque minus all the bagel carbs) and the French toast. The French toast was made with three types of bread- maple, pumpkin, and banana nut- and topped with raspberries, strawberries, mango.... So needless to say no syrup or topping was necessary. Both of these were incredible. The French toast was a creation of the owners (which are a husband and wife pair) and it did not disappoint.  I had the Crispy potato, asparagus, beans and Brussels sprout bowl, it comes with two eggs your way and is a great healthy option (which the menu is loaded with other nutritious and veggie loaded options). My boyfriend had the shepherds biscuit and he loved it. The menu has somethings to satisfy all!"}
{"text":"We LOVED the food at Duza's! I ordered the Savory Crepe and had a side of potatoes and proscuitto on the side - it was *divine*. I wish I could eat that every day, the sauce is just amazing. I want that sauce on everything.   My boyfriend enjoyed the Shepherd's Biscuit, which he totally loved, and our friends ordered the Crispy Naan and the English Breakfast - both vegetarian-style.  Their menu is a bit of a challenge for vegetarians - our friends are strict vegetarians and the girl who took our order didn't offer any substitutions for the meat they removed from the Naan and English Breakfast. She also seemed to rush us through the ordering process. However, the woman who was either a manager or the owner was really nice and was able to answer all of our questions. Everyone recommended the crepe, which is why I ordered it, and I'm so glad I did.  Docking one star for the vegetarian challenges/ inattentive order taker + their fly situation - we really wanted to sit on the patio because the weather was beautiful, but we were really annoyed by the flies once our food started to come out. We were lucky there was an open table inside so we could move."}
{"text":"This was an awesome place for breakfast/brunch.  The breakfast special sandwich with ham, sausage & egg was delicious!  It was a gorgeous day so we sat on the cozy patio.  It took a little long to get the food but the server gave us a heads-up on the time because they just got slammed as we were there.  For a new restaurant, they handled it quite well and they well all really nice.  I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon a new favorite spot. This hidden little nook is 10-Stars.  Great food and ambiance. Kinda like a little secret you wanna brag about. Awesome!!! Family owned with a kick."}
{"text":"Great relaxing atmosphere. We had a make your own omelette and the breakfast lavosh. Our breakfast was exactly what it was supposed to be. Eggs cooked properly. The owner was super nice and personable. It was about 10 minutes from the airport tucked away in a little neighborhood setting. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast food. They seem to have the slowest cashiers in the restaurant business and unfortunately have a fly problem on their back patio but everything we have tried there (with the exception of the grits) was fantastic. I haven't tried their lunch offerings yet."}
{"text":"Located in the historic Coronado neighborhood in Phoenix, we almost didn't notice this place at first. It looked like a quaint little house which has been converted into a quaint little cafe. But once you sat down, you begin to notice the artwork on the  wall (done by local artists and is on constant rotation every few months or so, so we were told by the super professional and courteous host/server). Then the menu. Oh the food choices on the menu. We got these: 1)Shepherd's Biscuit piled high with meats and eggs 2)Pumpkin quinoa porridge with almond milk 3) House hash 4) Smoked salmon and trout with radishes, capers, red onions, spinach with a balsamic vinegar dressing, and tomatoes, along with a cheese lavosh (which looked like a thin cracker)--loved the deconstructed presentation of my other  food love, which is the same stuff but served on a toasted everything bagel!  4) for drinks--brewed green iced tea, coffee (delish!) and served with cream, and brown sugar or with Stevia  5) a chocolate croissant--just because.   Set us back around $50.00, but basically we did order food worthy of four people    In the end, I managed to take but three tablespoonfuls of my porridge--yeah, after finishing off my fish platter, I was done for. I was super full!   Final verdict--will return ASAP! The Japanese-like simple elegance of the food plating is impressive. By the way, the chef is Bosnian, and he knows good good and from the looks of it, art as well. They've been around for two years only. I want them to last for as long as possible. Duza's is that good."}
{"text":"Five star service, atmosphere and food. Should you need more than my word, a few examples to support. 1- Owners are awesome - personally invested in each dish and such genuine, authentic people you want to succeed in this place! 2-Food. We absolutely love most any daily special, but have a few regular go-tones on the menu as well: the pumpkin porridge =amazing. The Arepas= delish. Salsas that accompany this dish are solid. 3-Atmosphere-comfortable, simple and welcoming environment, feels like you're visiting a neighbor and friend when you come.   Get there. Now!"}
{"text":"Great service,food and hometown feel. Highly recommended. We are from out of town and we're delighted to find such a great little place"}
{"text":"Delicious beyond words!   My family and I stumbled into this place while visiting Phoenix. We walked in with high expectations after browsing though Yelp looking for the best place to have breakfast... the place certainly did not disappoint.   This place is in what looked to be a residential neighborhood, you are asked to take a paper menu at the door, grab a seat and come back to the counter to place your order when you are ready. The cashier was very nice and patient while we placed a custom order for our littlest one, you are handed your drinks on the spot and given a number to place at your table so that the sever can bring your food to your table.   I expected for our order to take quite a bit of time as there was a sign at the door asking guests to be patient; however, our food was brought to us after a brief 15-ish minute wait which we enjoyed as we sipped on a cup of coffee and enjoyed the serene atmosphere in their back patio seating.   All of our dishes were delicious, the food looked to be very high in quality and fresh, the presentation was just superb.   Quick tip: Tip! I noticed a few people in front of us did not tip when paying at the counter, maybe because they are ordering at the counter themselves; however, the food is brought to you, the server cleans up after you, and the entire staff (servers, cooks, etc) look to work very hard to make your experience a great one."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I ever had !- Lisa of Phoenix ,AZ . This place was delicious holy smokes lemme tell ya , if you like good breakfast in a welcoming open kitchen this is your place ."}
{"text":"Small place to eat, quaint and off the main road. Maybe an old home converted to a restaurant. Plenty of parking in the lot across the street set aside for this place. Coffee and pastries. Hearty and healthier breakfast options available. I had quinoa pumpkin sweet potato porridge! So good! Fresh food. Great service!"}
{"text":"This is of my families favorite restaurants in Phoenix; the food is really amazing. It's a small place with tiny interior and a bit bigger outdoor seating. While I've tried at least half of the menu and everything is tasty my favorites are definitely the savory crepe, crab shrimp Benedict and the assorted French toast. The savory crepe has an amazing taste and is lighter, the crab is fantastic and the French toast is really unique, fluffy and stacked three high. I sometimes get the crepe then French toast as a dessert :)  Great chef, nice BYOB Friday night special menu (follow their FB page or sign up with your email), and very reasonably priced - there's no reason not to go here all the time!"}
{"text":"We arrived and were greeted by a man who confused us a lot saying that the place was closed, but he took us to talk to the chef and ordered eggs for us. He was a little bit too friendly but it was ok. We found out later that he meant the special holiday celebration that the restaurant was hosting earlier in the morning was over, not that the restaurant was closed. The food was good, we never got a menu so I can't say anything about the options, but my eggs & bacon were cooked perfectly! The coffee was also good and the owner told us that they buy it from a local roaster. I would say that it's a good place for a quick brunch, it was worth trying."}
{"text":"Loooveed my experience here! I came after a morning hike and was looking for something light for brunch. The outdoor patio is incredibly adorable and cozy, reminded me of someone's backyard.   The food itself was amazing as well, I had the beet salad and it was so simple yet satisfying. The beets had that nice crunch to it, and the dressing was light and not too overwhelming. My brunch date ordered the Shephard's biscuit and loved it.   Good food, good ambience."}
{"text":"Service could use some work.... I gave it 3 stars based on how poor service. Very unfriendly, staff. Which is sad because it was the best breakfast I've had had in Phoenix after Moving here 4 months ago!! I'm dying to go back but can't bring myself to do it......"}
{"text":"A perfect place to sit and enjoy a great meal. Cozy and quiet. A great outdoor patio to enjoy too! The meal was perfect! Thanks chef!"}
{"text":"There is a new breakfast hot spot in town - you better get in now before people start lining up! We came at 9a and you know around these parts, you expect a wait at this time on a Sunday morning. Not at Duza's!  The restaurant inside was pretty small and cozy- I am sure the maximum occupancy for eating is 25 or something like that. We found many tables for two so we snagged the biggest one. There is a patio that can seat more people so don't worry - Duza can seat you! Just dress accordingly.   Anyway, hubby ordered the Mexican Breakfast Torte and I ordered the omelet with goat cheese, prosciutto, roasted vegetable (bell peppers), and mushrooms. My drink of choice was the hot white chocolate mocha and hubby ordered the Vanilla Latte. I liked the drink, but not the biggest fan. Unfortunately, they have one size (a small size) for drinks, which is a bummer. My man loves his coffee and his coffee drink was pretty sad looking. I told him he can order another one if he wants but they are $4.50 a drink, a little on the high side...  Let's get to the food...  I thought the ingredients I picked for my omelet was gonna make my omelet oh-so-good and sadly, it was just ok. The goat cheese tasted off - and they put big chunks in the egg that the goat cheese overpowered the flavor of the other ingredients. I also tried the Mexican Breakfast Torte and that was pretty good. I ate more of that plate than the omelet. Total of the bill = less than $30.   What was great is that it took about 30 minutes overall from the time we ordered to when we were done eating to leave. We did not have time to sit and chat - we had errands to do so this would be a good place to order, eat, and be out.   While we were walking out, I saw someone with the Berry French Toast - that thing looked amazing! I will back for that...."}
{"text":"Went to Duza's grand opening day today and it exceeded my expectations. First off the location is in the same building as the former Astor House, not much has change decor wise, except it's a little more of a rustic French take versus urban mid-century like the Astor House. Everybody from the cook to the cashier greeted us as we walked in and we grabbed a menu. It's a paper menu for now as they are rolling with this for about a month to see how the customers feel about their menu. I had The Hash which is essentially a meat bowl (prime rib, sausage, ham, etc) sautéed with an assortment of veggies with two sunny side eggs on top. The meat was seasoned perfectly and not over salted (my pet peeve) and very tender. My husband had the Shepherd's pie (I think that's what it was called, Shepherd's something) and his was delicious as well! His consisted of bacon, prime rib, sausage, avocado and a Gruyere kind of cheese on a flaky biscuit, so good! They have different pastries, coffee options as well as fruit infused water and juices. The entire menu sounded delicious so it was hard to pick something! I was very impressed considering it was the grand opening and will be back for more."}
{"text":"I got the turkey sandwich on cibatta and it was amazing!  The people working at duza's were awesome. After I finished and was leaving the chef asked me how was my meal. I was shocked. I told him it was fantastic. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp! We would never have found this dog-friendly (front patio), awesome place for breakfast w/out you. Great omelets with Ciabatta bread, delicious sauces, and tasty sausage! Service was excellent too! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Duzas was absolutely fabulous.  I had their savory crepe for lunch that blew my mind.  My mother had a salad that she also enjoyed.  Our server/owner was so sweet and very attentive.  The chef who doubles as her husband/owner was very sweet and very good with my little girl.  He held her a little bit and then offered to make her some pumpkin purée!!  Which she loved!  Afterwards, we asked them what pastry they suggested and they gave us a Bosnia version of an apple pie and it was amazing.  We went to pay for it and they said it was on the Chef!! I loved the energy that they had here, it was all so positive and warm!  It's in a house turned restaurant and I hope that they become a fixture in the neighborhood.  I would eat here all day everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"A very tasteful breakfast. I had the Arepas and the French toast. It was so good! Definitely recommend trying this place out if you're craving breakfast. They do serve sandwhiches but I didn't try them."}
{"text":"This was a place I really wanted to love. The coffee was good, along with the food. However it's a little cramped inside. If you go outside you will be attacked by flies. The wait for our food was about 40 minutes which is fine, but I was definitely hungry by the time it came and the portion size was a bit smaller than hoped."}
{"text":"Loooooove this quant lil house.  You can sit out front, inside which is very cozy or outside in the back yard which is very adorable and has lots of shade.  The giant beans and brussel sprouts dish is perfect for folks wanting a more savory breakfast, like myself.  It is very tasty, and I suggest you right on over there and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Mouth is watering for what I have heard others call \"the best breakfast in Phoenix\" ... I totally concur. I will be making this place a habit."}
{"text":"The food is very good, the atmosphere is great. Service is not bad, just a little slow. Food was worth the wait. The backyard with outdoor seating has ample shade with the mature trees and umbrellas. Overall, fantastic!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at amazing prices! Lots of variety, so all goers should find something that appeals to them. You can't go wrong with any of the dishes. Pretty busy for breakfast on the weekends if you are a late riser. I recommend getting there before 9:30 if you want to eat right away."}
{"text":"Fabulous vegan breakfasts here - just leave off the eggs. The rest of our group also did well. See picture of two children enjoying cinnamon rolls and potato chips - not what I recommend but it worked for them.  This restaurant is small and off the arterial streets. But is easy to find and totally worth while."}
{"text":"Great food worth the wait . Highly  recommend this joint to anyone . Not costly at all .  Staff is friendly and knows the Menu well . Infused water is amazing and the salmon is the best I've had in central Phoenix ever ."}
{"text":"Stellar service! Warm greetings once you walk in! Cute quaint place. Adorable courtyard! Ordered veggie omelette and biscuit egg breakfast. Biscuits made from scratch. Food was fresh, and the coffee is amazing! A must see , newly open!! Owner & staff super friendly!! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Nice, solid breakfast.  Small menu but good variety.  Nice quiet area of town.  Indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Put the phone down this food was absolutely brilliant and tasteful never had a meal so put together in my life my husband and I had the ratatouille YES ratatouille!!! It was an amazing experience the taste was different in each bite -- was unique  also hD the English breakfast the bread hAd a crisp ring to each bite you could only taste !!!this !!place is a true Arizona gem !!!! A must go  will be recommending to every 1"}
{"text":"I ordered some French toast, which was delicious. Service was friendly. Cozy atmosphere and an excellent back patio with ecclectic furniture for a unique urban escape."}
{"text":"I had an omelette, it was good. They let you choose 3 ingredients from a pretty large list every additional is $1.50 extra . My husband had the Mexican torte which he said was great!!! Looked delicious as well. The only thing that I thought was different, was you need to order at the counter then they do have someone bring you the food but that's all. They ask you to put a tip on the receipt when you order, before anyone brings you the food?? I regret giving a large tip because all they do is bring you the food. Just an FYI"}
{"text":"Amazing  food and wonderful people. We were visiting friends in Phoenix and stopped at this place be use it was on our way. After we eat here once we returned again couple of times for breakfast and lunch. The food tastes very good and is presented in a very appealing manner. The people that work here are friendly and welcoming. They have a very cozy outdoor patio."}
{"text":"We ate at Duza's while visiting Phoenix.  I had the wild mushroom crepe and my husband had the torta plate.  Both were incredible and the coffee was superb.  Austin and Tui (?) (very nice blonde with glasses) were incredibly helpful and friendly.  We ended up buying a piece of art off the wall and they took care of everything.  I highly recommend dining at and supporting this fantastic establishment."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and were very impressed. The food was fantastic and very reasonably priced. Great little neighborhood spot in the Coronado District. Will definitely be stopping in regularly for breakfast or lunch when in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Highly recommend it: I had savory amazing crepes with mushrooms, spinach etc unbelievable! And fruit infused coconut water...amazing menu something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood spot. Amazing food and good service. There were so many things we wanted to try.  The patio was great for kids. We had the Hash and Savory crepe.  Both were amazing!   The inside of the restaurant is a cute mix of homey and contemporary.  Everything is fresh and made to order. They had a great selection of pastries and sweet breads for such a little place.  We had the strawberry rhubarb muffin to close out our visit and it was warm and the perfect mix and sweet and tart."}
{"text":"Such a quaint little place.  It was too cold in the a.m. for us to enjoy the patio but we plan on doing so a soon as the weather warms up as it is too cute to pass up. The service was friendly and attentive, the food was Delicious and pastries are perfect! Thank you chef for a wonderful first time experience.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot...very attentive owner. You can tell she cares about the customers and providing the best service possible."}
{"text":"We just finished breakfast for four, fantastic. Great independent place in a neighborhood. Foodies will be happy, very fresh ingredients, artfully blended with amazing presentation. We will be back."}
{"text":"I had the shepherd's biscuit, coffee , and a complimentary Bosnian dessert like fruity baklava. It was all incredible . Reasonably priced. The outdoor setting in the back is great for brunch and my server was incredibly pleasant."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and creative, and best of all delicious! Nice atmosphere in a cute restaurant. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Not sure where I was heading, as I was traveling from Scottsdale but decided I was up for an adventure. The neighborhood was a up and coming and full of an eclectic group. I highly recommend this place if you're interested in a hipster feel in an up and coming hood with yummy creations."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot in Phoenix if you are just coming into town!! Try to avoid eating outside unless you don't mind flies. But the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try breakfast restaurant. Very friendly staff, our cashier was very helpful, nice atmosphere, gorgeous patio and the most importantly, great food. Presentation was nice, and the flavor is even better.  We ordered French toast, Arepas, House hash, savory crepe, and special of the day.  Each dish was very unique and flavorful without over saturated in butter or salt. Everything tasted fresh.  We sat out in the patio which was very nicely shaded and cozy.  They also serve vegetable/fruit infused water, which was very refreshing.  Tried some pastries (bear claw, pecan bread, and cookie) and they were delicious as well.  Definitely recommend this place if you like healthy breakfast that tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Duza's Kitchen is my new favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix.  There are plenty of places that serve bacon and eggs, but there are very few places offering a creative, well thought out menu with unique, interesting dishes.  Everything on Duza's menu is made with quality ingredients, and is just a step above the norm.  Thick cut, grilled asiago cheese toast instead of plain white toast.  Sliced fresh fingerling potatoes, seasoned and sautéed, instead of traditional home fries.  And specials for breakfast - something you don't see at your local diner.  Prices are excellent, and the staff is friendly.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Every1 here is super friendly from the front staff to the cooks .. The menu has great options n there's a nice balance where's there smthg for just abt any1 n a lot of fresh veg input which is nice to see. The house hash was great; meat n veg were cooked properly (great texture/seasoning) along w the eggs. This historic phx neighborhood is fortunate to have such a great lil go to breakfast joint that isn't a nasty chain restaurant rushing orders."}
{"text":"OMG WHERE HAS THIS PLACE BEEN MY WHOLE LIIIIFEEEEEEEEEE! All drama aside, I randomly searched for a spot to eat and so happy Yelp pointed me here. :)  It's a super quaint and charming spot, and would be especially amazing to sit outside in cooler weather. It truly has a family feel and the service was very friendly. Multiple people stopped by to check on us and give recommendations since we had never been in before.   Now let's talk food.... they make their smoked salmon in/house and it literally melted in my mouth. I think that was the best bagel and lox I've ever had! We also ordered the raspberry croissant bread pudding with whiskey sauce, and just wow.  Apparently they recently started serving brunch and I'm so glad I discovered it. Can't wait to go back to try dinner!!"}
{"text":"Great new breakfast+lunch addition to the neighbourhood. I love the variety of the menu and the prices are super affordable. My wife has brought me back take-out from there a couple of times and all the breakfast and lunch items have been consistently good.  I visited for the first time this past weekend and the place was hopping! There are pre-made croissant sandwiches in the cabinet for only $3.50 and the beet salad served in a jar is well worth a try.   A couple of opportunities -   1. Checkout girl was not the friendliest. Seemed like she might have been having a bad day and was trying her best to make sure everyone knew it.  2. No wifi. There is even a sign that says \"no wifi - talk to each other\". I think that's a bit condescending to be honest. What if I came there on my own? You probably don't want me talking to myself in your restaurant, may not send the right message! I get that you probably don't want the Starbucks-Hipsters camping out at your tables for hours sipping on a bottomless cup of coffee, but other people might really appreciate the wifi. For example, my wife holds a breakfast meeting every Wednesday and brought her team here last week, but needed wifi to be productive, so they will go back to their other place now.  As it is only a short walk away from my house I'm sure we will be back many times to work our way through the menu."}
{"text":"Found this place for brunch and absolutely loved it.   Small,  intimate, cozy with outdoor shaded seating available also.   Open air kitchen so smells amazing.   Had the savory crepe and the shrimp and crab Benedict.  Both dishes were fantastic.   Great service as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Second time here, very personal and cozy place with the chef // owner behind counter making his tasty creations! Something for everyone, vegetarian options, gluten free choices, coffees, pastries to hearty breakfasts and of course the creative salads in a jar to go or the hot prime rib sandwich with horseradish is to die for!   Try it out!!"}
{"text":"As an out of towner, I'm not sure how we even found this place, but I sure am glad we did! I will say, this is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had! Three of us ate that morning and we all had different meals and they were all fantastic! It was obvious that whoever was cooking that morning actually cared about putting out good food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast that I've had in a long time. It has the feel of a house converted into a restaurant which it may be and the staff is amazing. I went with their daily special of eggs, sausage and rosemary and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"The food gets 3-4 stars but the place is run so terribly that it ruins the experience. We went in on a Saturday at noon for brunch. We sat outside on the patio and waited an hour and a half for our food. They had said it would take a while but an hour and a half is absurd. The server came out many times with a single plate and a drink and didn't even look over at us. She seemed completely inexperienced and lost. It was almost closing time and we finally asked about our food and it turned out they forgot to print the ticket. They said \"sorry\" and refunded our money but there was no sense of urgency or ownership. No one came over to our table to apologize in a professional way. It feels like a place with just a bunch of employees but no manager to make you feel comfortable or smile at you when you walk in.  Super odd staff! The food is good though."}
{"text":"This is such a great place if you're wanting a great quality breakfast/brunch. I usually walk over on Saturday mornings, since I live in the neighborhood for either the Savory Crepe or Parmesan Toast, both equally delicious! The house coffee and tea selection is pretty good too. The staff is super friendly and attentive--for this restaurant being fairly new, it's impressive to see how smoothly it's ran--much love!"}
{"text":"Had a friend recommend this place; it's new to the neighborhood. Excellent service and quality of food! Very impressed. Went for a late brunch on a Saturday. They did a vegetarian variation of the Shepard's Biscuit, which was amazing! My friend got the prime rib & eggs special and loved it. Coffee drinks were done well, and pastries looked excellent. All around a cute and tasty addition to the Coronado area! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Our first time here in this little neighborhood breakfast place & didn't disappoint. Food was delish & place & people were welcoming. Will be back"}
{"text":"Always smiling faces at our neighborhood breakfast spot, and the food is fresh and gourmet quality.  It's perfect for us because it's kid friendly too."}
{"text":"What a gem!  Delicious and the people were so friendly and nice!  We will make the trek from Carefree here!  Best breakfast in 2017!"}
{"text":"Seldom have I had a better breakfast than I have had here. Everything had a perfect blend of flavors and tasted absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic little neighborhood breakfast and brunch place in the heart of the Coronado district.  Fresh roasted coffee and farm fresh creative menu items. This is a hidden gem that I'll be returning to often!"}
{"text":"According to Yelp, it said it opens at 6am on Sunday's. Well I got there and it wasn't...so I went to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little spot for breakfast. Lots of charm with great service. Truly unique options to choose from. My second time here and I like it even better than the first. Had the Apple Crisp Hot Cereal with a side of bacon this morning. A nice blend of healthy and not so healthy."}
{"text":"Tried Duza's Kitchen for 1st time today and had an omelette all picked out, when chef put up a plate that looked amazing so changed my mind...It was the shrimp and crab Benedict and was absolutely delicious, lots of fresh crab and shrimp. Great coffee, attentive service, I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"1st time was brunch before the Heard... very good food and the staff was very flexible with my wife's special diet...I had the English breakfast the a tint of jalapenos in the sawsages. We will however sit inside on pour next visit,  the flies were a little bit of a problem in the back area. Didn't take anything away from the food or a very attentive waitstaff they were great... it's just getting to be summer in the city"}
{"text":"First time here.  What a great breakfast!  I had the breakfast torte and my wife had the English breakfast.  It was so good we are talking about coming tomorrow to try something different.  Service was great and the owner came out to check on us."}
{"text":"Every time i go here I wonder why I would want to go anywhere else  Everything  I've ordered has been wonderfully satisfying. I may have to get a part time job just to support my habit. The staff is already like family - warmly friendly- they really care about your food. I've had all of the breakfast dishes and can't pick a favorite but order the crispy potatoes and the omelets the most often. For lunch I go back and forth between the seared tuna and the salmon - - I need to get something new but they are soooo good. I usually ask the chef to make my omelet the way  he would like it - OMG !!!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and served beautifully. Sweet little space and centrally located too. I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Friendly owners, great food and great atmosphere!  I lobe that you place your order then sit and relax over a coffee while an amazing like no other breakfast is being prepared for you. This is a must eat when in PHX.  We just happen to so lucky it's a 2 minute? walk away!"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Kathleen \"that was the best breakfast I ever had\" in regards to the Crispy Breakfast Naan. I had the arepas! Amazing!!!!!!!!! I never leave disappointed. Every time I'm here i leave very happy. Great coffee too!"}
{"text":"Later post:  visited this restaurant about a week or so for breakfast, it was awesome!!! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went in to Duza's after a bike ride and decided to have a healthy meal today. I was greeted by their lovely staff and was told to sit anywhere I wanted to. I chose to sit in the back patio and ordered the salmon dish which was served with seaweed and asparagus. IT WAS SO DELICIOUS. The presentation was beautiful and the servers were really sweet. Thank you! This was not my first time and I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Some of the best flavors I've every experienced for both breakfast and lunch. Some of the most unique and amazing choices as well as some standards with flair at a fair price. You won't regret eating here and you will come back!"}
{"text":"Great healthy way to start your day!!!  Open early and Jojo and chef are always there to greet you with a smile.  Amazing selections on there menu and there is always a different creative special every morning."}
{"text":"Yum! Fabulous neighborhood place for breakfast and lunch. Totally casual, order at the counter situation, laid back. Front and back patios and amazing local art inside. I love that this is next door. The turkey on Asiago is to die for and don't get me started on the lemon bars. Must try!"}
{"text":"Yasss! I LOVE this place. They have a dish with vegetables and tofu, for breakfast! I didn't think I would be into it, but it's so good. I wish they had mimosas!"}
{"text":"Looking forward to breakfast tomorrow morning at our favorite Mexican morning dig. Amazing flavors!"}
{"text":"Excellent! The arepas dish is dynamite. Quick and friendly service- patio out front is dog friendly and offers a good amount shade. Iced coffee is delicious and free refills make me want to jump up and down like a kid in a candy store! Highly recommend for a brunch spot for all. Great job chef and staff!"}
{"text":"vibes on vibes on vibes. cool little neighborhood joint. came on a sunny sunday, ate on the patio beneath some trees. vibes, vibes, vibes  anyways, the food is on point. went with the arepas and my face just melted into a delirium of deliciousness  no matter where i looked on the plate, i got hit with something tasty and tantalizing- blue corn arepa! spicy chorizo! egg! salsa! giant beans! bada bing bada boom  highly recommended. I don't even really like breakfast but these guys may have converted me into a breakfast truther   even their free water is baller. (got fruit and stuff soaking in it)  winner"}
{"text":"Totally clueless when I walked in but the young lady at the counter asked us to grab a seat wherever we liked & she brought over our menus and water immediately after. Ordered the Turkey Asiago Sandwich with a side wedge and it was excellent! The food took about 15min to arrive and it was worth the wait! I demolished the entire plate. Very good food and a nice and cozy atmosphere. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! So fresh and perfectly cooked! The service is amazing and the owner is so sweet! We will definitely be back again and again!  We had the Hash and the Shepard's breakfast. Food heaven! Even their iced tea was delish!"}
{"text":"I love this place...usually only stop in for small bites. Though whenever I get a full plate entree, my body and belly feels enchanted. The staff is kind and welcoming with pleasant vibes. Thank you for being in our neighborhood, and being a restaurant practicing deliforms of culinary arts."}
{"text":"My new go-to breakfast joint.  Apparently, they're celebrating four months and I hope they stick around much longer.  Common format for a cozy, little breakfast spot.  Order at the counter and they drop it by your table.  Food was out pretty quick, presentation was spot on and the ingredients were flavorful and fresh."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant in my recent experiences that the food truly felt like someone's personal effort.  Both my husband and I were extremely impressed with the quality and uniqueness of our dishes (also the pricing which is low!).  When ordering I asked what was recommended and girl at register suggested the \"Shepard's Biscuit\" and \"Mushroom Crepe\".  Both sounded too heavy but we ordered anyway.   It turned out to be fresh, flavorful and much lighter than I expected.  Extremely happy with our experience,  and we are already recommending to our friends.  The only small flaw was the patio had some flies which was a tad annoying but won't prevent us from returning very soon."}
{"text":"This is my third time eating at Duza's Kitchen and every plate that I have ordered has been amazing. They serve gourmet style dishes that don't disappoint and for a more than reasonable price. The restaurant itself is a well utilized adapted home in the Coronado Neighborhood."}
{"text":"Cute, local place. The food was fresh and my poached eggs were good but the rest was too cold and the flavors didn't blend well. The texture mix was all soft and no variety. Too pricey and they have tip ahead which is ludicrous."}
{"text":"So delicious.  I had the Shepard Biscuit,  done if the best meat I've had.  All local meats.  Awesome place - Great service,  great prices, local art."}
{"text":"Such a lovely place. Thank you for offering such a great breakfast and lunch place for the local community!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Just moved to the neighborhood and stumbled across this little gem! Food was amazing! Service was amazing! Met the owner Victoria and she was so friendly! I wish I could give 10 stars! Will be back again:)"}
{"text":"This place is SO cute! A little too hot to eat outside but the outdoor patio is adorable. Ordered the chicken on ciabatta, latte and a freshly baked cinnamon roll to top it all off. Everything was delicious. If you're looking for a cute and quiet place for breakfast or brunch, come try this place"}
{"text":"Unique little place, and menu. I was disappointed in being sent outside to wait to order and then they took orders for the people behind us that stayed  inside. A lot of flies. We tried it, food was not really what we were hoping for but not really impressed. Maybe we'll  try it again one day."}
{"text":"This is the cutest little brunch spot in the historic Coronado neighborhood.   The food was amazing and well priced.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The family and I really enjoyed not only the food, but the atmosphere. The owner came and spoke with us and she was delightful. Would definitely come back to Duza's when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has been open three years and I have not eaten here. I ate at this location back when it was the Asher house which was a wonderful little smoke/barbecue restaurant that went out of business.  They have lots of outdoor seating which is wonderful in the spring and fall, this being a colder winter day the warmth of the indoor seating, Was quite inviting. I am mediately was met with a cornucopia of wonderful smells as I came in the restaurant.  We were properly seated by JoJo a very bubbly server. All of the people working at the restaurant seemed quite friendly. We were immediately served coffee and flavored water. The flavored water was a very nice touch a combination of mint, honeydew melon, and lemon. That was a nice touch. They had a special that looked very interesting. It was a combination of eggs hashbrowns, gravy sausage pork belly on a toasted ciabatta I don' eat potatoes and bread that I did not order it. But two people at my table did and thoroughly enjoyed it. The one comment that I got from the people that ordered it was they wished the pork belly was cooked more like bacon instead of served in a softer almost like a thin baked pork chop.  Another person at our table had the crêpe since she is a vegetarian. I did not taste it but it looked extremely tasty. It was done with a mushroom sauce that looked very flavorful and hearty.  I had an omelette with prosciutto, Portabella mushroom, Burrata cheese and sautéed arugula. I prefer a very fluffy and not overcooked omelette and this one was made to perfection. With tip our bill was just short of $20 a person. That might be considered pricey for breakfast. But the quality and the creativity well compensated for that cost. I would highly recommend this restaurant and will be back."}
{"text":"5 stars !!! Excellent service & food. Just landed in Phoenix and asked Siri where to go, and what a great place."}
{"text":"To call this place delicious would be an understatement. We had an omelet with prosciutto, mozzarella, mushroom and arugula as well as the crispy potato bowl with asparagus, Brussels sprouts and over easy eggs. Both were fantastic, and the homemade green salsa was the best I've tasted.   Additionally, the setup of the restaurant was somehow both modern and charming. This is truly a can't miss breakfast spot, and I'm sure the other meals would be delicious here as well. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The first time we came here, we came in from the back door. We were told to order at the counter and sit where ever we want. That makes sense so, when we went last week, we came in from the back and stood in line at the counter. The hostess told us the line is toward the door but a man was standing in front of the door and a couple was sitting on the bench probably waiting for a table. There was no room in that area so we stood in front of an empty table, next to the door. Then she asked us for a name and if we wanted in or out. I was a bit confuse. Are we putting our name in to wait line and then wait to get a table? She was annoyed and said the sign is in front of the door. Shouldn't this place be \"order first then find seats\"? If you are going to take names, then seat them and, when they are ready, they can order at the counter. This way you clear the entrance area. We like the food but it's not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try last time we were in Phoenix area. It was so good that it is our first stop this trip to Phoenix. Great atmosphere and amazing food and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Not much on the menu, or I guess I should say I'm not really into creative dishes. Im a simple traditional breakfast kinda girl.... but if you're into the new hipster, seasonal, new food-trying thing?.. This is def for you.  I tried their Chai Latte and it was pretty darn good! Just did not like their food."}
{"text":"Cozy find! Nestled in a cute area, this little cafe is perfect breakfast spot. Staff was friendly and attentive. My food was yummy -I had the veggie bowl with scrambled eggs. Was healthy, tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Cute little restaurant with a great back patio. Food is fresh and tasty. A tad on the expensive side though (paid $15 for a latte and small veggie omelette). The coffee was really good! I will probably be back!"}
{"text":"So great having this tucked away spot just down the street from us!   Our visit here the second time around was delightful. I tried the Savory Crepe which was delicious! Lots of oven roasted tomatoes and mushrooms, fresh spinach and a creamy cheese binder.   Hubby had a turkey sandwich which was fantastic. It comes with a side of kettle chips. The ciabatta bread was especially nice.   The next day, my brother flew into town and was starving after his flight. I dont think I've ever returned to a restaurant two days in a row before!   We both ordered sandwiches and a side salad. It was a delicious Caesar, whole leaves of romaine with chunks of parm and a really good dressing.   I like the open concept kitchen and am super impressed with the size of the kitchen area vs the size of menu/quality of food they consistently provide.  I haven't tried any if their pastries from the case but their Chai drinks are great. I stopped drinking coffee so I love having a spot to get a good iced Chai  (:"}
{"text":"5-stars is not enough.  A small quaint local kind of place with a chef to die for.  Breakfast meals are about $9-$13 but with taste and presentation they should be $18-$22.   It's on a corner of a historical residential neighborhood, has indoor as well as outside seating under the trees.  A somewhat modern decor in a home setting.  I hope to make it back.  I was on travel taking our kid to the ASU Downtown Phoenix campus and found it via Yelp."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect, the wait was a bit long but consider it was a Sunday brunch time we did great. The food was fresh and perfect. Coming here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Duza's is a great example when a chef meets his appreciative audience. I am an experienced foodie and I can tell you that this place is par excellence! My only worry is that they will grow out of their modest space and move away! Excellent food prepared most exquisitely and presented beautifully! Excellent pricing and bountifully locally-sourced food with an eye on nutrition and full impact taste! Great food, great service, great service, great ambience! A true gem in the Coronado District!"}
{"text":"This small eatery has the most fabulous meals that are almost pieces of art. Staff is super friendly I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I usually try to eat a healthy breakfast, but the chef special was way to tempting.  Two delicious crusty on the outside soft and buttery on the inside slices of ciabatta with sausage, bacon, perfectly cooked asparagus, and a delicious sauce to top it off.  Amazing!!   My husband got the Shepard's biscuit and enjoyed it.  Also very reasonable prices and conveniently close to the airport"}
{"text":"Place is a hidden treasure. Fresh food and culinary art. This place is definitely a must try."}
{"text":"I don't usually vent on Yelp, but how long should I have to wait to place my order AND THEN how long should I have to wait for my food....AND would it kill somebody to get me a cup of ANYTHING to drink when you tell me I have to wait 20 minutes to order and them make it more than 35?  If you come here prepare to fetch your own water, or find someplace else when these folks are full.  Last time here the food was great, without the wait, but few place's food can offset sitting on a wood picnic table hoping to order so you can wait again. Very disappointing. Very embarrassing when you bring guests.   Finally got food ordered. $50 for 4 people and can't promise how long the preparation will take. Turned out to be another 30 minutes for most and a few more for the 4th plate...and silverware for all.   I'd love to give credit to the server aiding the table behind me for bringing drinks and taking their order at the table, but it unfortunately adds to the frustration for customers not accorded those courtesies.   PS.  If the slice of Oreo cheese cake that got set on our table as a waitress flew by  was a token of an apology, it might have helped to say something. We were waiting to find out is was a mis-delivery so we left it in place."}
{"text":"Good,  friendly service. My friend had the salmon and I had the crab/shrimp egg Benedict.  We both enjoyed our lunch  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Cute little place we found on Yelp and the food here is fantastic. They only serve breakfast and lunch. Simple menu but the food has great presentation, flavor and quality. Service was amazing too. I wish there's a place like this in Vegas. Definitely highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to try this place for breakfast while I wait for a family member to get out of surgery at the Va, Called to make a takeout order and they said they couldn't take my order. Busy or not, that affects whether someone comes back or continues to visit. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Duza's is delightful!  The atmosphere is charming, the wait staff is beyond helpful and the menu is new and fresh!  While looking for a breakfast/lunch restaurant located in Downtown to Midtown Phoenix to meet friends, I stumbled upon Duza's Kitchen when reviewing Yelp reviews.  And what a great stumble it was!  Immediately upon walking into the restaurant, which is located in a residential area in the Coronado District, you feel at home.  A young lady handed us menus and explained we ordered at the counter and the food would be delivered to our table.  She also pointed out the breakfast special of Prime Rib, Eggs, Potatoes and Mushrooms which was nicely plated and not made of plastic.  It was Father's Day so I'm not sure if they regularly have a breakfast special or if it was due to it being Father's Day.  I plan to return, so I'll find out!  One fellow diner's eyes lit up when hearing the special and said he didn't need to review the menu.  My other fellow diner opted for the House Hash (Prime beef, ham, smoked brisket, peppers, scallions, shallots, portabella mushroom potatoes & eggs) and my mouth was watering after reading the ingredients for the Pumpkin Quinoa Porridge (Quinoa, almond milk, sweet potato puree, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, flaxseed, organic agave syrup, and on top chopped candied pecans and shaved coconut).  Our selections did not disappoint, in fact each of us thought about licking our plates!  Several times we were asked about drink refills.  A young woman who turned out to be Duza's owner, came over to ask how we liked our food.  We all responded enthusiastically ... WE DIDN'T LIKE IT, WE LOVED IT!  She told us the restaurant has been open 9 months and things have gone well so far.  She is unsure how business will be in the summer.  Well if today, which was the hottest day of the year, is any indication; she will do just fine!  There was a nice steady crowd during the time we had the pleasure of being at Duza's.    If you are in the Coronado District or even if you are not, be sure to visit Duza's Kitchen - you will not be disappointed!  --Fork of Fork 'n Knife  Be sure to check out the reviews written by my fellow food critic, Knife of Knife 'n Fork.   Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Really carefully and skillfully made food. Perfect atmosphere and an excellent back patio with ecclectic furniture for a unique urban escape. Warm staff, feels like you're at someone's house.  Little pricey than other breakfast places because the food quality is top notch."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked in a historic neighborhood in Phoenix. Very modern design with art on the walls, concrete, open kitchen concept.  The food was delicious!  Ordered: the omelet with Boursin, prosciutto, tomatoes, and spinach. With crispy bacon (applewood) on the side  Also the crispy Naan Bread with prosciutto, sunny side up egg, arugula, pico, hummus.  Out of the two meals I would order the omelet again, the naan bread was a unique blend of breakfast and lunch, however still tasty. The cappuccino was great and they made it with almond milk for me which was an added bonus.  I would highly recommend for breakfast."}
{"text":"Everything was made with love. We were a large family group and sampled many dishes.  All we're unique, tasty and with creative presentation. The service was awesome!"}
{"text":"After a hike up squaw peak we were famished and looking for good food with a good atmosphere to take our out-of-town guests to. After reading yelp reviews, we decided to give Duza's a shot! As everything on the menu sounded so delicious, we decided to each order something and then split it all 4 ways... OH EMM GEEEEE... Was that a good decision! The Mexican Breakfast Torte was most of our favorites - so yummy and spicy. Arepas were a close second! After enjoying a really nice meal in the cute little misted yard, sipping our super tasty iced coffee  (excellent coffee is served here!), we kept eyeing the neighboring table's Assorted French Toast and just HAD to order it. Best. Decision. Ever. What a great excuse for dessert at breakfast. We even had a surprise encounter with the owner of the restaurant. She was so down to earth and fun to talk with! Can't wait to to return and try additional items off the taste bud tantalizing menus"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing time! I came here with a friend yesterday and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience! Although not on the cheap side, it's definitely worth the money. The food was served beautifully and the next time that I come I definitely am going to try some of their baked goods which looked amazing! I highly recommend trying the breakfast crepe, one of the best I've had! Definitely come here if looking for a new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!  Great place for a lazy Sunday brunch in a crafty neighborhood.  Food was excellent and service was always with a smile.  Nice balanced menu for vegetarians.  Try the Arepas if you you're not.  Baked goods were temptation that don't disappoint.  Leave the guns at home and take the canoli ;)"}
{"text":"Great spot and really delicious/ unique dishes. Presentation also could not go unnoticed. Friendly staff seems like a authentic family owned restaurant. Very clean too! Outdoor seating environment was quirky and fun."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service and staff. Essentially family owned and operated. Very cool open kitchen. Had the vegetarian breakfast ... Just right. Get there early for breakfast. Nice baked goods too."}
{"text":"Wonderful in every way. The ingredients in my omelette were very balanced. I will definitely be back here to eat again."}
{"text":"Awesome local feel , very authentic and unique. Love the atmosphere indoors and outdoors . Food is awesome and creative ! The chefs here are culinary artisans at a cafe price !"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and crafted from angels! I'll just leave this here for you, (slides paper toward you, you take it and open, which reads), \"The Shepard's Biscuit and potato's, you're welcome!\""}
{"text":"This place was an absolute gem to find on my last trip to Arizona in early June. I had an omelette with proscuito, capicola, scallions and burrata cheese. This is absolutely one of he best things i ate on the entire trip. The flavors were absolute perfection. The omelette was cooked perfectly, the burrata cheese was an incredible touch, so mild and soft in flavor and texture. I could eat this everyday and be happy. An ace in the hole for Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! Tucked away in the historic district you wouldn't even know it's a restaurant until you see the little sign. I got the cold plate which was absolutely sublime and the bf got the shepherds biscuit which he said was amazingly delicious. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for delicious food in a great and cozy environment! We will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Wow and wow this place is FANTASTIC  BREAKFAST at another level  Worth every penny spent  Service extraordinary"}
{"text":"I have been to to this adorable tucked away breakfast joint about 7 times now (yes sometimes more than once a week) and every time the experience has been everything I could hope for!! the food is absolutely incredible. I have tried almost everything on the breakfast menu and everything is to die for. three of my favorites have been the French toast, the arepas, and the shepards biscuit. the prices are reasonable and the people are welcoming. I will definitely continue going back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  Beautiful spot with an awesome owner!  Great for coffee and delicious baked goods.    Accommodating for a walk with your dog (outside seating), date, business breakfast/lunch, and families.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Another gem in Coronado, a lovey brunch spot that closes at 2.  You order right at the counter and they bring the food to you when it's finished.  I went with the Shepard's Biscuit and my wife ordered the Crispy Breakfast Naan Bread.    The Shepard's Biscuit was good, how can you go wrong with applewood smoked bacon, Italian sausage, and brisket on a flaky biscuit with cheese and guacamole!  There was just a small portion of avocado, it would of been nice with either more guacamole or some type of sauce. Some of the bites were dry and not nearly as tasty as the bites that had guac.  The Crispy Breakfast Naan Bread was very tasty.  It was made with all fresh ingredients. Although the naan bread was not very crispy, it was still very yummy.  The price was affordable, both our meals were priced around $8 each."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant tucked inside Coronado neighborhood. Had a DELICIOUS veggie omelet. GLUTEN FREE TOAST (which you can't find everywhere). Will definitely come back to this spot. Only downside was that I couldn't find a plug in for my laptop."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great atmosphere - definitely a hidden gem. We went out of our way to drive down into the Coronado district and would make the drive again, no problem. The Parmesan toast is ridiculously amazing. :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I stumbled on it on day running some errands. So glad I did. I loved it so much I took my wife two days later to treat her to the wonderful eats."}
{"text":"What a great spot! Was on 2.5hr layover at Sky Harbor for my next flight so I decided to venture off site for something to eat. Yelp took me here and man it did not disappoint! Everything from the ambiance, friendly staff and food were spot on! Oh, and the coffee - so good! Best cup I've had in a long time! I had the breakfast special which was fried chicken with country gravy served on slice of asiago bread, homemade hash brown style potatoes and topped with 2 eggs. Delish! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars is a no brainer! I can confidently say this is the most amazing breakfast I've had in the valley!   I had the Arepas, which is something I've never heard of and it was to die for. Eggs with chorizo, sausage, giant beans and more. So so good.  Staff is friendly, small kitchen and very personable, I thanked the chef in person on the way out for the amazing experience! Very welcoming environment!  I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"How many times have I quietly cursed the nearby restaurant here for not being open for lunch? Plenty.   My curses have been overwhelmingly silenced by the arrival of Duza's Kitchen! Solidly, so warmly and joyfully solidly has this new eatery exceeded my expectations with fresh and locally-sourced ingredients, served up in a friendly atmosphere, with a wonderfully varied menu.   It's a cozy open-kitchen set-up, with a huge patio out back and a small one out front (facing 12th St.)   I had my eye on veggies and eggs but when Anna at the register suggested Crab and Shrimp Benedict, it was like she won a mental match game. Of course that's what I really want! (Always) This dish was cooked perfectly, came with a huge slab of avocado and one part of the bread (not typical English muffin) was cheese and tomato.   It. Was. Perfect.   I did get the veggies & egg bowl (potatoes & brussel sprouts, two egg, etc to go.) Same outcome, hours later. And cold. Perfect!   You can't beat a chef with a passion his heart that you can taste on the plate. Duza himself is at the flames, masterfully creating not only delicious and flavorful meal combos, but also plating them with a straightforward artistry. He popped over to a couple tables with a sweet treat. (Try the baked goods!) There is a terrific lunch menu too; breakfast served until close at 2pm."}
{"text":"Worst coffee in all of Phoenix.  Food was overpriced and only mediocre.  It has a cool atmosphere, but that's about all; my husband and I were really disappointed."}
{"text":"I was going to check this out several times because it was so close to where I was staying. Unfortunately it was never open. Once it closed early for an event and the other time it was closed for the day. So I never actually went. It's a shame their hours are so limited."}
{"text":"Really stoked we found this cute little place! Its right next to Tuck Shop in the Cornado area. You order at the counter and the staff brings your meal to your table. Being newbies we asked for recommendations and the helpful staff said the Arepas were her fav so we both ordered that. Oh my goodness it was so delish! It has these big white beans (corona beans?) a tasty thick corn pancake thing (forget what's it's called) and they cooked my eggs so they weren't runny (I do appresh). Lots of fresh flavors and clearly prepared with L-O-V-E.  And a really cute back patio. I didn't see a Bloody Mary etc option but that's ok i enjoyed their coffee. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's a must place to visit when in PHX. I stumbled across this kitchen and fell in love with it. Food menu always surprises me. I wish I could try it all.  Great quality food and service. It's making me hungry just writing this review."}
{"text":"The husband and I came here for brunch on the day after thanksgiving (after many weeks of convincing on my part) and I am so glad we did! The food here was legit. It was 2 legit. You see where I'm going. Anyway, we arrived around 11, which is usually when they stop serving breakfast, but they were serving it all day for black Friday I guess.... we ordered at the counter - he got the shepherd's biscuit and I got the breakfast pita concoction. We sat down and all of the sudden the restaurant was flooded with people, good timing on our part. We had coffee while we waited, which was fairly tasty. The food came out and the plates were huge! My pita looked so fresh and delicious. Who knew that pita, hummus, feta, over medium eggs, arugula, and prosciutto made the perfect breakfast? This thing was so good, it had a freshness from the arugula and a richness from the feta and prosciutto. The pita was warm and fluffy. I haven't had a combo this tasty in a long time. The husband's was a little less exciting, but still good. It was essential a pile of meats on a biscuit (brisket, bacon, spicy sausage, and maybe something else?). I think he was hoping for a gravy of some sort. Regardless, he seemed to like it as his plate was completely clean at the end of the meal. All of this only cost about 20$. We'll be back!  PS- If this place put pancakes on the menu, it'd be an easier sell for my husband, just sayin..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I went for breakfast for the first day of my vacation in Phoenix and it was perfect!!  We all had great meals and everything was so easy.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This is my first time here and I am visiting from NY. I discovered this place thru Yelp and decided to check it out since it has good reviews.  It's a relatively small BYOB restaurant, more like a diner. The place was busy (Sunday AM) and moderately noisy. There is an outside patio area great for groups and sunny days.  The staff is nice and helpful. But I was NOT too happy for having to wait more than 30min for my food when I came here alone!  They softened the blow by giving me a 10% discount on my order. I ordered the Shepard's biscuit, which was good and original but also felt quite greasy.   This place is good for an innovative American style breakfast, but not for healthy food or vegetarians( a few items on the menu are)."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast & lunch. The Chef has everything anyone would want X 10, the flavor is exquisite. I would go out of my way to eat there. I definitely recommend to all my friends & family."}
{"text":"I bike past Duza's in the morning on my way to work. I usually pass by before they are open at 6AM, but today their door was open so I stopped in and picked up two muffins to take with me. These great people were kind enough to take care of my order even though it was not yet 6AM. I could have received a \"sorry we're not open yet\" but that didn't happen. I am going to try to time my ride so I am there at 6 and maybe enjoy breakfast rather than rush to work.  Thanks again for going out of you way to help me this morning!!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal new neighborhood breakfast spot!  Service is always great and the food is always delicious!  Once you become a regular, there may be some tasty treats coming your way that you didn't even order!  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"This place has a weird charm to it. We sat in the back patio area and everything back there was kinda tossed together hap hazardously and looks cool. The food was really good, I got the special which was a pretty odd combination of Italian sausage, fried chicken, eggs, cheese, and bread then covered with gravy but it was super yummy. Our first waitress was a little slow but the second one that took over was super speedy and polite. Will be going back again to try everything else!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the 1st time today after I started following them in Instagram and the food looked amazing! It's tucked away in a little neighborhood that I previously wasn't familiar with- the Coronado District. Super cute!  We brought our 1yr old twins and were meeting my brother in law and his fiancé there. We got there earlier and snagged a table. Typically, you would go to the counter and order and the servers will bring you your order. But because we had the twins and a larger party, they actually came and took our order for us! Great customer service! The food was amazing! I ordered the Parmesan toast with prosciutto and asparagus and it was so flavorful and delicious. My husband had the shepherds biscuit which he loved and I ordered the twins the overnight oatmeal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after dropping my daughter off at school one morning.  What a find!!!  This place is tiny, not easy to find and the counter staff is a bit pretentious but the food is fabulous.  I had the polenta.  Skipped the accompanying eggs and added shaved parmesan on top.  It was to die for!  All the diners around me seemed equally satisfied with their meals."}
{"text":"The menu is diverse. The vibe is downtown cool and laid back. The food quality is perfect. Ingredients are fresh and delicious. Exactly what I was looking for in a breakfast café."}
{"text":"The best breakfast, by far, in he whole Phoenix area!  Here is why: - perfect balance of ingredients - delicious and well presented dishes - great service - well priced for families ( should be more expensive) - personable and caring attitude from every employee  They use best ingredients and unlike many places that just heat up already prepared food, they cook food to order and exactly as you want it!  Support them, there are not too many places like this and if we don't give them business we will be forced to eat at chain- restaurants serving unhealthy food."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, unique menu, chill place to hang for brunch!  Support local great places like this!"}
{"text":"I had an omelette with fresh tomato, baby spinach, ham, ham, and Boursin cheese. Only bothersome thing was you could only order four items before they start charging $1.99 for extra veggies. The have a limited number of sodas (2), and no iced tea!! She offered to pour hot tea over ice. It's AZ, cold tea please. Ambiance was standard. They have an outdoor patio, a bit too rustic for us to eat out there though."}
{"text":"This was a Yelp find for us and did not disappoint. We were in Phoenix with no idea where to go to breakfast and we landed here.  A neighborhood restaurant and great food, well presented, wish I lived closer so I could go there all the time. The tables are a little close together but check out the outside dining option."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast - really delicious. Interesting menu lots of choices.  I think might be the best breakfast place in Phoenix. Staff is spot on. Casual place and tiny so go early on weekends."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Coronado.  Don't be fooled by the fact that it's counter service in a yet-to-be-fully-gentrified neighborhood.  This is a small place with a big heart, attentive staff, huge value, and the most creatively conceived and beautifully prepared comfort food.    I would never have guessed in a thousand years that I would moan over quinoa porridge but this stuff is incredible - quinoa, sweet potato puree, flaxseed, agave syrup, candied pecans and a heavenly mix of baking spices and ginger.  Warms your soul from the inside out.  Hiding behind the deceptively simple name, \"Cold Plate\" is an artfully presented tapestry of cold smoked fish, heirloom tomatoes, capers, eggs, and other goodies all waiting to be placed on a light and crispy cheese lavosh.    Ever since the closing of \"My Arepas\" in Chandler, I've been on the lookout for a good Arepa. Chef Duzic's version does not disappoint.  A beautiful, thick, maize dough patty is topped with Chorizo, queso, quac, fresh green salsa, and creme fraiche.  The whole thing is nestled by giant beans and topped with - what else? - a perfectly fried egg.    All this plus a beautiful patio, serve-yourself Passport coffee, a take-away case with delicious pastries and house-made jams, and the Cardinals game playing on the house speakers on game day.  Congratulations, Duzic family!  Duza's is our new go-to Sunday brunch hangout."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great neighborhood atmosphere, and very friendly staff.   I had an omelette and it was the first true French omelette I'd had I believe.  Impeccable ingredients and perfectly seasoned.  I did learn that portion sizes are smaller, but it was well enough for me, but I would guess others might appreciate that the portions are more for building a meal than being the whole thing on its own.  Really looking forward to go back and try everything they make!"}
{"text":"Duza's was a cozy little breakfast spot right in the Coronado Historic District. The pastries and muffins are made fresh and the staff are incredibly welcoming! You can tell when a chief of a restaurant puts their heart into their work-the food was delicious!  +++Had a few tasty Gluten free options for pastries/sweets++"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Very tasty and fabulous quality. Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me tell you , dont be fooled by the outside , ones you step in this place you feel the eclectic vibe , fresh pastries and the food is absolutely fantastic , my breakfast was called Arepes I believe, a big piece of black bean patty topped with chorizo , fava beans and 2 eggs sunny side up my goodness very delish , even my teenager liked this place , if you are  looking for something different and new dont hesitate , try this place , you wont be disappointed , also the staff is super nice !"}
{"text":"i got really excited from all the reviews and got the arepas. the dish looked and smelled really good, but i think it fell a little flat for me. was expecting more meat but there wasn't that much. i did enjoy the cup of coffee i got and that there was outdoor seating. :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place.  Very cool relaxed atmosphere and the food was top notch.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here with relatives - no one had a thing left on their plate.  Very good food and very yummy coffee!!"}
{"text":"Hands-down one of the best breakfasts I have ever eaten in my life! We visited on a quiet weekday around 11 AM after landing in Phoenix from California. We were looking for a place that served real food where we could sit outside and enjoy the amazing weather.  We found it. The staff was friendly, the food was amazing, and the setting was great. We ate out front on the patio and enjoyed a wonderful meal. I had the Shepard's Biscuit and I feel like writing home to my parents to tell them how good it was.  Put this place on your list and stop here when you can!"}
{"text":"What a find!!! This hidden gem near downtown Phoenix had a nice little outdoor patio, the friendliest welcome, a delicious menu, and stellar chocolate cake!! We were greeted upon entering and could not believe all the yummy choices on their menu (very meat heavy btw.) I chose the Sausage Arepas with spicy chorizo, fresh eggs, avocado, and tangy salsa. You can cover yours with creme fraiche, but I could not. My friend had the special - chicken fried steak and creamy gravy - oh my yum. Our hot teas were refilled, the service was excellent, and when they brought out our piece of chocolate cake I thought I had died and gone straight to Godiva Heaven. Rich and fudgy with chips throughout. Wow. I can't wait to go back, and believe me... I will and I'll bring my friends too!!"}
{"text":"1st visit and it was wonderful! Happy people and great food. The Chef's special was delicious and the service was super!"}
{"text":"We were going to meet my son, daughter-in-law and amazing granddaughter #lexidanger who is 14 months old.  This looked like a different and funky place down in the Coronado District which is central located to us.  There was a bit of a wait but it was a beautiful day and they finally sat us in the front at the picnic table while we waited to order.  The chef sent out some puréed squash for #lexidanger and she ate that bowl with gusto!  NOM, NOM - she gave it a thumbs up . The son and hubby had the Shepherd's Bisquit and they said it was terrific with a very smoky brisket and sausage.  The daughter-in-law and I had the Assorted French Toasts.  This was three slices of French toast made with banana and chia breads, lots of eggs and fresh berries and syrup. Absolutely amazing and the chef came out to talk to us about her French toast creation.  #lexidanger lived the berries and we thanked the cook for the squash too!"}
{"text":"SO glad we discovered this place. Food and service was great. Friendly and pleasant atmosphere, with outside seating where you can bring your dog along, if you have one. The drip coffee was really good, as was my  Latte  . Hubby had Arepas and it was out of this world. I had the Shepherd's Biscuit and it was also excellent. Eggs were cooked perfectly on both dishes and the Applewood smoked bacon they use is increduble. Also, the presentation was as much of a feast for the eyes as the food was for our stonachs. Would highly recommend Duzas to everyone."}
{"text":"Seriously, EVERYTHING here is top-notch! Excellent quality, hearty, healthy and moderately priced. Have brought vegans & carnivores and everyone was thoroughly satisfied everytime"}
{"text":"Food and service is wonderful here, awesome staff with first class food.  You can not go wrong coming here. We are hooked with Duza's Kitchen, and guarantee you will be to."}
{"text":"Everything on Chef's menu is absolutley scrumptious!    From the Shepard's Biscuit, with a melt-in-your-mouth biscuit Chef makes daily, to the Savory Crêpe made w/ portobello mushrooms, arugula, roasted artichokes, oven-dried tomato, boursin cheese and wild mushroom cream sauce (GASP!) everything will leave you absolutely satisfied and happy The atmosphere the second you walk in is warm and friendly; I'm not just sayimg that because I work here, hehe    Duza's  Kitchen is so cute and perfect for family gatherings, friendship reunions or for feeding your employees with yummy food, the positive vibes you will recoeve will keep you coming back for more! And I say this because I even come in on my day off, lol- no joke. No wi-fi but bring a book to read or your favorite craft project; there's plenty of room in our back patio for your knitting group to relax and enjoy. Hope to see you soon!"}
{"text":"What a gem! Visiting grandma in Phoenix and we drove up from Laguna beach. Found Duzas on yelp and gave it a try. Amazing find and can't wait to go back. Went with the wife and we both had a tasty brunch with awesome service. Try the Arepas as the breakfast Naan. Super delicious."}
{"text":"Finding this restaurant was such a treat! The menu has so many creative and healthy options. I got the shepherd's biscuit (veggies substituted for eggs) and my cousin got the crispy breakfast naan bread. Both meals were beautifully plated and tasted amazing. The atmosphere is really cute with Julie Child quotes."}
{"text":"Love this place, Such a great addition to the neighborhood. Their prices are great considering I used to spend more on some crap fast food on the way to work when I could get an amazing crepe(i do no artichoke cause the tart takes away from its epic-ness) for close to the same price.   I tried a few things here so I will just list what i like and dont like:  Like: Shepherd's biscuit - Great meal to split, its awesome but filling. I like it without the avocado, even though i like avocado its better without.  Mexican Breakfast Torte - It comes with different bread sometimes but I ask for the biscuit since I am not a fan of the blue corn bread. Also filling but tasty as hell.  Savory Crepe -  (-artichoke) That borsin cheese with the tomatoes and mushrooms are so darned tasty. The mushroom sauce is amazing and should be bottle and sold in stores.  Ganache chocolate cake  their version of shepherds pie with the phyllo is great  Their ciabatta toast  Chef makes perfect scrambled eggs better than anyone  ive never had an omelette but considering how awesome the eggs are I would assume its good.    Meh but still good:  Arepas - too similar to the torte but just not a fan  Hash - its good if you want light flavor  English Breakfast - not a fan of the sausage they have but still not bad  most of the specials I tried have been too similar or not as good as I expected but this is nit picking at this point.    The staff and owners are awesome people and always nice. I know some people are impatient but when food is this good, its worth the wait and the price is right."}
{"text":"This place really takes breakfast to a whole new level. Simple yet delicious with a unique flare! It's my second time here and I'm more amazed than the first. It's no wonder they are almost always packed! We did have to wait a while to be served but the wait was worth it. I'd just recommend on continuing to invest in training your staff to be alert when the rush comes in but aside from that, the food and drinks are phenomenal!  I love their freshly pressed pear juice and they chai latte. Add an expresso shot for an extra 'wake me up' boost and enjoy! Their Tofu scramble omelet on a wheat tortilla was incredible. My 1.5yr old ate almost all of it himself!!! The seating area outside is really nice, and recommend outside seating when taking your kids because it can feel a little crammed inside. The owner is awesomely nice and cares about her customer's experience and the chef is super cool! Come by and check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place! I saw the reviews online and found that they had grits on their menu, (I am a connoisseur of grits). Whenever I see a place has grits that's automatically what I order. That being said, they were definitely disappointing. The grits tasted like they had thyme or some other kind of spice that turned me off to this dish and my eggs were over cooked. I also ordered the biscuit with sausage and brisket, but that too was not very good. Maybe because I just had some awesome brisket at Bobby Q's the night before, but this brisket was sub par by far. The pro's: the biscuit was delicious, it tasted fresh and was soft and buttery. The side of toast we ordered was also delicious. The bacon on the sand which was thick and cooked perfectly. It's an adorable little spot with a great patio and a small off street parking lot. The staff was very friendly and even offered us a free fruit infused water."}
