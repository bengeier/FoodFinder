{"text":"I would totally rate this  best coffee place in Cleveland. Plus real matcha bubble tea with no artificial ingredients."}
{"text":"i looooooovvve it  everything is perfect perfect perfect  I tried the matcha green tea latte and the waffles it was more than yummmmmmmy  it worth to try. clean quite and they have a free wifi love it"}
{"text":"Found this place randomly on Yelp. Excellent coffee and customer service. Will definitely be back if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"I'm all about supporting local coffee shops but their baristas are amateur at best, overpriced drinks for no reason..mine had no substance and they offered nothing to fix it for me. The owner should probably get the basic fundamentals of a coffee shop before opening his own.  I feel like the place is a cubicle.. I go 1 block away and get a better cup."}
{"text":"It's definitely the best tasting coffee in the town. The service and the hygiene of this shop are particularly commendable. I only wish it opened till late on the weekends."}
{"text":"really cute place. had a pour over, which was great and a raspberry croissant, which they warmed up without me even having to ask. will definitely be back to try the bubble tea and the waffles (which the folks next to me had and looked yummy)."}
{"text":"Great place-- they have a really nice selection of teas, and they offer bubble tea and Rising Star coffee.  The space is very open, with lots of natural light.  A great addition to Playhouse Square, which is lacking in locally-owned coffee shops with good seating area."}
{"text":"Match Bubble Tea.  I've died and gone to heaven.  A great little find in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Very nice shop new tea and coffee shop near Playhouse Square. The interior is very nice - very clean, with a beautiful long wooden coffee bar, high ceilings, and hanging globe lights.  They've got pre-made pour over coffee if you're in a hurry. I had a very nice Columbian + Brazillian coffee blend pour over made fresh. They use Rising Star coffee.  They've got Taiwanese, Japanese, and Chinese teas too, which I haven't tried yet.  They take cards through Square.  Overall a nice new shop that I hope does well."}
{"text":"Chill out and have some tea with those thoughts...  This a another great, local small business that offers delicious teas (all kinds, not just black or green) in a comfortable space that lets you and yours split off from the outside world for a while.  Trendy slow-pour beverages are still simple and perfect.  The service is really friendly and makes you feel welcome every time.  21st century online systems and social connectivity keep it with the times and crowds.  Parking? Not so much, as it's on a side street from bustling Euclid Avenue. This a perfect place for the walker to pop in, warm up and head out to finish the day."}
{"text":"I ordered the matcha latte and it was very rich and full of flavor which I appreciated. It was a good space to study and get work done!  The one annoying thing is that you have to pay for parking along the street and it is only for a max of 1 hr. If it had better parking options I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had an iced pour-over coffee, wife matcha latte. Both were delicious, and prepared with utmost care. We had a bagel (with black pepper thyme cream cheese) and a blueberry scone, also yummy.  Highly recommend...many types of tea as well, and boba (bubble tea) in the afternoon."}
{"text":"I can find nothing wrong with this little coffee shop. If you're lucky enough to find it, nestled on the corner of Chester and E. 12th, definitely stop in and have one of the tastiest coffee beverages in town. Serving Rising Star, they quickly won me over. Rising Star coffee is some of the best in Cleveland, if you ask me, so Vintage is certainly a treat (and really close to work!). The staff is always super friendly and they've got some really talented baristas working here. The place itself is super clean and modern without much to distract you, which is good for productive visits or quiet chats with friends."}
{"text":"Cool place.  Strictly coffee and tea (only Japanese and Taiwanese... Strange combo if you ask me).  Nothing to eat.  Plain interior with modern cold furniture.   I had a cup of latte (one size only) for $4.  Good taste but it had an acidic after taste which usually comes with packaged beans.  Not as fresh as I wish it to be. Not a bad place for takeouts."}
{"text":"More and more places are starting to brew Rising Star beans...which is a great thing.  My iced latte was good with the Brazilian single origin espresso.  Bold yet deliciously refined.  Zen-like interior design.  Nice selection of tea...thank god.  We need greater accessibility to good teas!  $4 for a 9oz latte makes it price competitive with Pour and dare I say Vintage pours better coffee than Phoenix.  Time for Phoenix to sharpen its pencil!  The major turn off was the sign on the counter.  It blatantly tells people not to reach across the counter for straws, etc.  Really?  Way to tell people you are a bunch of germophobes.  Get over yourselves and relax.  Don't tell the customer to relax."}
{"text":"If you're looking for delicious coffee without all the unnecessary frills and flavorings, this is the place! They take care to focus on the flavor of the actual bean and offer tasting notes for customers to look over before deciding. They carefully curate beans that are well-rounded. All you need is a splash of milk (or not!!)  Their coffee is pour-over style and delicious!! They also offer pastries. I selected a bagel and it was delicious - crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside!"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff. Quiet and clean. I got the matcha bubble tea and it hit the spot. They also have wifi, and some really fun art on the wall. I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"Best place in Cleveland to take a sit and hang out with friends. Barista are friendly, talkative and professional. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend a few days ago; we go to school in Oberlin and we wanted some bubble tea to celebrate the end of finals. Based on the really great reviews of this place, we decided to give it a shot.  I've had better. For the price and taste, it's really not worth driving 45 minutes to Cleveland. I got the green tea bubble tea, hot with half sugar, and my friend got the black tea bubble tea, cold. You can taste the quality of the tea, but it's not very strong tea. The boba was not good at all; spongy and squishy and just not good.   Wouldn't go back here again."}
{"text":"Passing through Cleveland and stopped here. Their tea and coffee were so yummy! I had one of the oolong teas and my husband had the Brazilian coffee. Their tea pots were very cute and you got a timer so you knew exactly how long to steep your tea for optimum flavor."}
{"text":"I really like Vintage Tea & Coffee. I've been several times and it's about time that I write a review.  First of all, the owner Jeff, apprenticed with Rising Star and learned from them for over a year about coffee. They brew and sell Rising Star beans here. I tried something new here - the barista suggested a mocha-ccino, a cross between a capuccino and mocha. Super good. Their matcha drinks are also super good.  He's also Taiwanese and has an authentic bubble tea recipe from Taiwan (no powder here!) It's pricier than other places, but it's because he uses real tea and very good ingredients. I've had the black milk tea, and it's delicious.  Then, onto the teas. Jeff selects the teas with great care and he knows a LOT about them. He has a great selection of Chinese, Japanese, and Taiwanese teas - including some that are really rare and hard to find. I've never been disappointed with any of the teas I've tried (or its presentation!)   Interior is clean, modern, and updated. I love the chalkboard art, which is all done by their barista, Loc (a CIA student). The tea menu also has beautiful Chinese and Japanese characters too!   I've grabbed things to go and I've also stayed and chatted with friends or worked on the computer (free wifi). In either case, I've always had a great experience."}
{"text":"A very cute very authentic asian coffee shop. Has a lovely and clean atmosphere. My friend and I stumbled upon it very early in the morning waiting for a bus and was pleasantly surprised. The small cup made with care definitely brightened and warmed our day in a cold Cleveland morning and they do have pastries that compliment the drinks well. Next time I really want to try their bubble teas and is excited to return."}
{"text":"Oh my god! Why I didn't visit this cool place earlier?! The coffee tasted fantastic and they do offering authentic and great quality tea from Japan, Taiwan and China. Once you tried their stuff, you wouldn't go back to Starbucks or other chain stores seriously! The space is neat and cozy! Perfect for get together, reading and study!!! I will definitely come here every time when I go back  I am saying this because I am a true tea lover. And I am so glad that we have such a wonderful place here to taste some real Asian tea.   First of all, they have variety of chose, and all of them are better than normal. You can really tell what's the difference between green, black, white and puer tea.   Enjoy tea is like enjoy wines in Western culture, it is more of a sense and concept than taste. I like the way they putting drinking in a glass pot. In that way, (to be continue )"}
{"text":"I live nearby but for quite a long time I didn't stop by to check out the place. I remember once it was a chili day and I was coming back from some outdoors event with my co-workers. At that point a cup of hot mocha was a dream :), so I finally went to the coffee shop...since then it's been one of my favorite places in Cleveland. I had a fabulous mocha and got so exited (and maybe still freezing) that went for a cup of matcha latte. That was actually the first time I tried this drink and must say I absolutely fell in love with it! After that I tried it at a couple of other places but none was as good as at Vintage Tea & Coffee. That being said, this is now my matcha latte place forever :) Also, they have a more than decent variety of tea. Continuing the story about my first visit, I should also say that I got the third drink  - a nice cup of oolong tea, which came as a compliment :) To finish, the atmosphere is nice and cozy there. Of course, I will come there again!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee and tea place that you wouldn't come across unless you were specifically looking for it. It is around the corner from the Statler arms building as you walk towards Reserve Square.   They have matcha lattes! Also, their cappuccinos are good too."}
{"text":"I really liked the look of the store. It had a very clean and modern feel, which was supported by the light wood furnitures and bright light fixtures. The store was decorated with interesting pieces of artwork.  Unfortunately, there was very limited space to get work done. I had seen a photo of the inside and had planned to stay here to study with one other person. However, the three tables available were quite small, and not the most comfortable study places.  I ordered the matcha bubble tea. The tea itself tasted fresh, but the bubbles were a little overdone--watery and chewy. Overall not bad, but on the pricey side.  The barista was really attentive though, came by and asked if I liked my drink and offered to remake it if I didn't. He also stopped by to see if we wanted any water--hot or cold too. That was really nice of him.  It was also surprising to see that they offered 5 Stars loyalty program here, which I am used to seeing back at home in California. It's nice because once you sign up, they'll constantly send you offers.  Overall, I really wanted to like this place, but as a study location, it just wasn't that great. Definitely would be a nice place to just come to chat or grab something to-go."}
{"text":"I got a matcha tea latte with almond milk and my husband got a Americano made with Slate coffee"}
{"text":"Tea and snack were both very good.  Location is a bit tucked away.  Very cool that they had some more niche options not seen many other places, but the assortment was very much limited to Asian styles."}
{"text":"Not for me. Hipster coffee shop with what felt like a 20 step process to make an overpriced mocha. I get it. It's all about the \"art\" of making a quality cup of joe, but this joe was close to $5 for a 12 oz. cup and was cold after waiting on said 20 step process to create it. I will stick to Starbucks & McDonald's...guess I'm not worthy."}
{"text":"I've gone here three times, and each time I've walked out empty handed.  I love boba/ bubble tea and was super excited to try it out.  First time I went on a Saturday around 5:30 and they were closed, even thought the website said they were open.  Second time, I went around 9:00 am on a weekday- hey don't serve bubble tea before noon.  Third time 3:00 pm on a weekday- they don't serve bubble tea over the winter. I'm giving up."}
{"text":"I had a bit of time before meeting with a friend in downtown Cleveland and decided to check out Vintage Tea & Coffee. I ordered the Matcha Latte and enjoyed reading and drinking my latte within the calm atmosphere of Vintage.   The only downfall I had with Vintage was the parking situation. The didn't have their own parking lot and there were no meters free nearby. If you decide to come here, make sure you have a couple quarters on hand to feed the machines. Or if you come after 6 pm on the weekday or anytime during the weekend, all meters are free."}
{"text":"I visited this place on a whim on my way to work and was pleasantly surprised! Very good coffee! The staff was very nice and helpful. The interior is really cute with stark white walls with brightly colored painted illustrations and geometric shapes. Very modern. It would be a cute place to bring your laptop and get some work done,nits small but roomy."}
{"text":"We popped in here after getting some awful espresso up the street. Nice clean atmosphere with friendly staff and Delicious coffee. Loved seeing bean options for different flavor profiles. Didn't get to try the tea, but there seemed like some amazing types to choose from. I'm coming back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Get the iced mocha with blend. Spotless environment and cool people"}
{"text":"A very nice little vintage tea & coffee shop. Located in the middle of apartment complexes right in downtown. Decoration is... sort of minimal but nice in its own fashion, makes it look clean. It is actually clean because the staff clears every table right after customer leaves. Staff is very polite and the service is superb. Coffee is okay to me. I have only visited once and will definitely visit again. Room for improvement: the lighting deep inside the shop could be brighter as the window space is relatively small hence not too much ambient light could go through."}
{"text":"I went here for coffee with a friend and at first was worried about getting parking because it was a Friday morning. I was pleasantly surprised to find multiple parking spots right in front on the street. I got a latte and my friend got a matcha tea. Both were delicious. Employees were very nice and friendly in the cozy hidden gem in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"I really thought I'd like this place. I ordered a chai tea with almond milk. It was not that great. It tasted like Indian Curry. I pretty much get chai tea everywhere and this was different. It wasn't terrible but it didn't blow my hair back. I would maybe try cafe latte next time.   The girl who took my order was nice and pleasant. There was an Asian guy behind the counter also who was very focused on something underneath the counter and didn't greet me or pay any attention at all which was strange.   Overall, not overly impressed but would give it another try. I always like to support local coffee shops when I'm traveling."}
{"text":"Wasn't busy at all on a Thursday afternoon, so lots of open seats. Staff was friendly and quick. I ordered a matcha bubble tea with whole milk. It was a 16oz cup for just over $5. It was really well mixed and tasty. A bit more expensive than I would like, but not too much. I will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Cute place for tea, one of the few places you can get Boba in Cleveland with real tea and not the powder stuff. The boba texture is perfect, which is so hard to find in Cleveland. I moved here from southern California and had a hard time finding places on par with the boba back home. Vintage tea is one I can count on for boba and yummy waffle ice cream dessert. If only the parking situation is better."}
{"text":"Clean, quiet coffee and tea place, with Asian options. The bubble tea was not very sweet, and I preferred the matcha to the black. The fresh vanilla waffle with ice cream was my favorite. Next time will try the matcha waffle. Atmosphere is quiet, with very low music and people working. However, talking out loud feels a little awkward. If you want a quiet and calm place to work, this is an ideal plax"}
{"text":"I'm coming here on a daily basis (when I'm in town for work of course) to get my matcha on! I came here to relax and work and ordered an affogato. Not many places seem to do this at a coffee places (mostly restaurants) so I was glad to see it on the menu. I asked for it with green tea gelato instead and it was tasty. Then the barista had an idea to try and make a matcha shot and matcha gelato affogato and it was heaven......I have found my addiction!!!!! She had let her boss try it out and then I got to be her guinea pig too. Boy was I ever glad to be part of that experiment. This is not on the menu and I asked if I could continue to come in and ask for this and they said no problem. You guys have it all. Great gracious service, great tasting drinks, a variety to choose from. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Fair warning though, I don't come here for the coffee - I come here for the tea. My favorite is their matcha latte. It's never too sweet and the actual matcha flavor is never lost - it's perfect. $4 for a 12 oz isn't too shabby.  Apart from that, I'm also a big fan of their tea menu in general. There are a lot of varieties from different Asian countries and the menu helps describe the flavors to help you make your decision. What's nice is you can get them in a smaller size or you can get a pot if you're planning on staying a while. a perfect companion if you need to get some studying done. The fact that it's within walking distance of CSU is also a bonus for any students. The downside is that this place is fairly small so there's very limited seating. However, if you are able to find a seat, this place is perfect to do work or study. The atmosphere is very calming and fairly quiet with no music playing but it never feels oppressive.   If you find a tea that you like, you can also buy the tea to brew at home - which is always nice.  Overall, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Coffee shop I never noticed, but will go out of my way to go again. Very cool vibe, great coffee, staff kicks butt"}
{"text":"I got a flyer a long time ago for Vintage Tea & Coffee, but just now got around to visiting. I'm SO glad that I finally made it over ~ my tea was delicious! I ordered a matcha latte, and it took me back to the wonderful matcha lattes I enjoyed on a visit to Japan a couple years ago. It was prepared extremely well ~ and they even offered a lactose-free milk option!  I will absolutely be back to try more on their unique tea list, and I can't wait to try their bubble tea as well!"}
{"text":"I am a huge boba (bubble tea) fan. I drink boba on average 3 days per week back home in Los Angeles. I was very excited to find a boba shop in downtown CLE within walking distance from my work.   My first impression of store was that it was very neat and clean. Gave me a very hipster LA tea shop vibe. I noticed on the menu that there were only two selections for boba: black and green tea. I asked if there was a green milk tea option, and the cashier looked at me really confused as if I was speaking a foreign language. She tried to sell the \"Jasmine Blossom\" tea drink to me... but she wasn't answering my question. \"Is there a green milk tea option?\" I also asked if Jasmine Blossom had milk in it... and she strayed away from answering my question and suggested that I order a Green Matcha drink which is very creamy. At that point, I stopped trying because she clearly didn't know what I was talking about.   I ordered the Jasmine Blossom with boba which was ok. It was very watered down and didn't have much flavor. The boba was very hard, and not fresh at all. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Imagine a clean Asian. Just think. Clean. And Asian. Ahh, there you have it. This is Vintage Tea and Coffee. Stylistically this place is neat, and clean, and Asian. And it's Quiet. QUIET. That was a command; don't talk so loud. No music, very little talking; just people reading, working and drinking. At one point the silence was so great I could have heard a raindrop.   Notice it is Vintage Tea first, then Coffee. Their tea selection is great, with lots of teas from Asia. Notice again, Asia. I tried my first matcha latte. It was prepared and placed before me as a beautiful green piece of art. I was impressed with the taste quality as well. Green tea flavor and yet, smooth and milky, like a latte. And ever so slightly textural. They do have coffee which I only looked at and did not try, yet. Rising Star coffee is the main coffee used (and Rising Star uses Vintage Teas). They have a Synesso, which is placed inconspicuously on the back counter. These combinations almost guarantee exceptional coffee.   The barista/tea sommelier was even Asian, with a bonus accent. And not only was he an Asian, he was also a very cordial Asian; and I'm assuming a clean Asian.   This must be what artisan tea and coffee looks like in places like Japan, China and Korea. In Asia."}
{"text":"Vintage Tea is a cute cafe that is great for studying or just grabbing a quick cup of tea/coffee!   I have tried the matcha latte, matcha Belgian waffle, and black bubble tea here. The matcha latte can be ordered sweetened or not - I asked for it a little bit sweet, and it turned out great. Creamy with a strong matcha flavor, subtly sweet and not grainy or powdery at all. Also comes with pretty latte art, so that's a plus :) The waffle was definitely an indulgence but oh so tasty! I didn't taste the matcha as much in the waffle, but that might have been because of the honey I added to it. Nevertheless, satisfying dessert for sure! The black bubble tea is definitely not the best I've had - it tasted pretty milky so the tea taste was not as apparent to me and the bubbles were a little bit harder than I usually like - but still decent and I would probably order it again if I was feeling milk tea next time I come.   The employees here are really friendly, and though a little small, the ambience of the cafe is great. Located in downtown, it's a little out of the way for me but if I want to camp out somewhere for a few hours in the future to study or work, I'd be happy to make the trip out to Vintage again!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday afternoon. Found metered parking right out front. Jasmine pearl tea was delicious--you can watch them create it from the hand rolled pearls! :-)  Clean, calming decor. Friendly, courteous staff. Definitely worth a visit if you're downtown!"}
{"text":"Cute spot in a great area- convenient walk from anywhere downtown. The owner is always around and very friendly. Love that they are environmentally friendly and compost!"}
{"text":"Vintage is super close to my office so I gave it a try the other day. The staff was friendly in a quiet way and the tea I was recommended was great (the Honey Scented). The inside is bright and immaculately clean.  My only qualm was that there wasn't a non-dairy milk option. I was really excited to try what was sure to be a perfect bubble tea or matcha latte, but couldn't. Having almond, soy or rice milk on hand would make Vintage a daily stop for me."}
{"text":"Their Brazil coffee mocha is really good. Bubble tea was a bit light in flavor. Nice ambience. The owners or employees were very helpful as they explained about the different teas and coffees. Definitely made us feel welcome and happy :)"}
{"text":"High quality espresso made very well! If you are a coffee lover you will like this place.  The baked goods were of great quality and taste as well."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee/tea place. Kind of hipster/modern. Three small tables and a few bar seats. $1 off the drip coffee during grumpy hour (8a-11a). The drip coffee is more acidic than I would like. Also got a bubble tea with black tea. It's on the lighter side, the tea isn't super strong and they use milk rather than milk powder, bubbles are decent. I like the tea favor, but it would be better if the tea was stronger. The matcha Belgian waffle with matcha ice cream and honey drizzle is very yummy. They also offer bagels, croissant, and Mason's ice cream. If you get their app you can earn points towards free items"}
{"text":"Goddamn they have some awesome bubble tea. Naturally derived ingredients (no powdered milk/flavors like other places). The bubbles are cooked in brown sugar and what not so they become sweet chewy little globes of heaven that make you want to cry. The lattes are also excellent. The perfect ratio of milk to espresso has flavors so deep that your mind enters a blissful state of nothingness. The teas are quality and selected by the owner from particular areas of Taiwan, China, and Japan that are known to cultivate the most succulent tea leaves known to man."}
{"text":"This is a nice hidden gem on Chester and 12th. I love their modern look, high ceiling and hanging T lights. They have an average sized space but only around 10 seats and 3 tables, plus a bar facing the baristas. But for those 3 tables (each seats one person if you work alone) you've got the best spot to work thanks to the bright storefront glass door. Their menu focuses heavy on tea with offerings of coffee and bubble tea. I had their most popular Dragon Well, a very fresh and pure green tea. I had the iced version which my amateur tea-drinking tongue won't be able to tell the difference (sigh), I'd recommend doing hot tea to preserve the taste though. Good atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"Yay! An Asian tea place!  After hearing about this place from fellow yelper, Joyce P., I had to go and try this place.  Now, the parking kind of sucks since it's downtown. However, if you work downtown or if it's not 5pm, then you'll be fine- I usually can circle the blocks once or twice and find some parking. :P  Nonetheless, you walk in and this place is cool. Hip. Clean. Modern. Nicely done.  They have a wealth of asian teas, and even some bubble teas. I haven't tried the coffee yet. Being a fan of brown rice teas, I ordered the genmaicha- it was brewed well and was delicious. There were so many other flavors I wanted to try- I'll definitely be back. But huge kudos on the authenticity! Just from that one cup, I know this place is solid on their asian teas.   Check it out if you want a good cup of asian tea- I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Totally digging the vibe and offerings at this coffee/tea shop, but I literally HAVE to leave a review about one horrible experience I had at this place. I ordered a waffle and tea. It honestly took forever, but that's definitely not why I was so upset. The cashier/barista whatever you want to call the lady was seemingly chatting up a customer while my waffle burned. I didn't really care about the chatting.. but the fact that she looked at my BURNED waffle.. blushed.. packed it up.. and GAVE it to me grinded my gears.  She said a bashful.. \"sorry for the wait\" As she handed me a package containing a charred waffle. I just stared at her because I was literally late for work and had no time to say \"what the hell is this\" I walked myself out and I will never return.. even though I literally loved this place.  And to keep it clear.. my waffle wasn't a smoldering mess, the bottom was pitch black and the top a darkened overcooked brown. I pray that wasn't the intended outcome.   It's been almost 3 weeks.. and I'm still thinking about the disrespect.. thus this review LOL."}
{"text":"A nice and lovely place to hang out with your love ones while your are enjoying the taste of your tea. Your host here takes care of you. Ask him for recommendations. :)"}
{"text":"Love their lattes. Always very creamy and delicious. Very clean place and very friendly staff"}
{"text":"The last time I was here I got coffee which ended up being Rising Star. Now knowing they serve someone else's coffee, my expectations are now appropriately set. They currently have a very nice El Salvadorian Rising Star coffee on the pour over bar which I recently tried and enjoyed, as well as a Sumatra.   I also finally tried the tea menu. I recognized a tea on the menu, Genmaicha, as a favorite of mine from Cleveland Tea Revival and so ordered that. I was met with the same roasted rice flavor which I find uniquely inciting and drawn towards.    What is more impressive to me than the drinks however is the consistent level of service. The staff doesn't let you stare at the menu for long, before offering up suggestions and detailed flavor notes, or offering to let you smell and view the tea jars. Just saying if you want tea or coffee is enough of a prompt for the very helpful staff here.   Vintage also now has a rewards program - of sorts. I've noticed these popping up at coffee shops all over town. Tracked by the Square credit card software you earn 20% off after 10 purchases. Not the biggest incentive here though with a cup of tea at $4; that's an 80 cent reward for spending $40! A free cup would be better - even if after 20 drinks."}
{"text":"First had the Vietnamese coffee at Cleveland Night Out. Was delicious, cold and came in a nice glass bottle. I've been going into the store every couple of weeks since then and always get the same. It's a little different in the store, but still tastes good."}
{"text":"This place is obviously very cute and trendy. We were lucky enough to get there when it's open. We had a green tea latte, an oolong tea latte, a bubble tea and a matcha ice cream scoop. They are all very nice and look very good in pictures. The store is new, clean and quiet too. The staff there were friendly and let me know what was ordered the most by other customers. We will definitely go back for endless times."}
{"text":"Haven't came here in a while and randomly decided to stop in. I love how modern looking and simplistic this place is. The matcha latte tastes authentic and is my go to drink. I also enjoy the pretty latte art. I'll be back soon to try the bubble tea!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quality cup of coffee or tea in the Cleveland area, THIS is the place to go. I tend to hate coffee or espresso that is bitter or overdone, but all the drinks I have had here truly are superior quality. The owner, Jeff, prides himself on only the best ingredients and methods for making his beverages. The baristas are also always very sweet and friendly. I should also mention that although the location can be a pain (parking is difficult) the inside is an oasis of relaxation away from the bustle of downtown, and very tastefully decorated with modern fittings. You can stop in to get a drink to go, or stay for a few hours and chat with the baristas. I'm looking forward to seeing this place grow and expand over time, and would highly recommend to others who appreciate a quality cup of coffee."}
