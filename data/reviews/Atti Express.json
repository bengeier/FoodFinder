{"text":"Don't let the lack of reviews fool you, this place is legit. It gets busy and a line forms at lunch, but it moves quickly.

Grab a side of kimchi to add some zing to your meal."}
{"text":"Bibimbap ! C'est un de mes collègues qui m'a fait découvrir cet endroit et je suis devenu un fervent amateur du bibimbap (au poulet pour moi, mais j'aime aussi au buf). J'ai même un jour changé le clavier de ce collègue vers le coréen pour lui donner l'idée d'y retourner ce midi-là. Ça n'a pas marché, parce qu'il avait déjà d'autres plans (ou peut-être ne voulait-il simplement pas manger avec celui qui lui avait fait une blague ce jour-là ?), mais peu importe, j'y suis retourné de nombreuses fois et la promenade d'une dizaine de minutes a valu le coup à chaque fois. Bon choix pour le lunch !"}
{"text":"Très bon spot pour le lunch si vous êtes au centre-ville, service rapide et efficace, bouffe coréenne délicieuse, portions très généreuses et excellent rapport qualité-prix (environ 9$ par assiette et vous n'avez plus faim après). J'y ai mangé le Japchae au boeuf et le bulgogi au boeuf, les deux très bons. Mais faites attention car à l'heure du lunch, la file peu être longue (c'est mieux d'arriver avant midi). Le resto est situé dans le tunnel de la Place Ville Marie. Il y a aussi le Atti BBQ Express à côté."}
{"text":"This place gets so busy at lunch time, and with good reason. This is a great fast food option serving good Korean take out at reasonable prices in the heart of business man land. 

The bibimbap may seem like an obvious choice, but it's worth trying!"}
{"text":"Meilleure option pour dîner au centre ville : Bibimbap au buf avec sauce piquante ou douce.. Un choix relativement santé, car il y a beaucoup de légumes, mais un peu trop d'huile. 

À mon avis, ça ne vaut pas la peine d'essayer les autres choses sur le menu. Attention, éviter de manger sur place car l'odeur envahit les vêtements. De toute façon, il y a peu de places assises. Il y a une grande file de 11:55 à 12:40, mais c'est quand même rapide."}
{"text":"I can't imagine there is a lot of people reading this review, when you think, quick, fast, cheap, lunch usually your mind goes to pizza or a burger or possibly a sandwich. Your mind should go directly to Korean BBQ! And the restaurant that introduced me to this is Atti. No joke! This place has become my basis for comparison for all other bimibaps anywhere else I travel.

This place offers an affordable fast and most importantly a HEALTHY LUNCH option. I still don't know what anything else on the menu is. All I know is that beef bimibaps is 10/10 or maybe 20/10, let's be honest, it's 1 million/10. It's fun, inexpensive, exotic and a great way to impress all of your burger eating idiot friends who think Asian sesame Subway is Chinese food.

I see they are opening a new location in the cours Montreal underground mall food court. I hope it does well, and I hope more people catch on to this super interesting cuisine."}
{"text":"I love this place, but I rarely get to eat there because they are closed on weekends and on weekdays they close at 5pm.  Living in Ottawa now, if I'm going to be in Montreal, it's usually over the weekend, but I was in Montreal during the week recently and got to eat at Atti Express once again.  

I went with my mom for lunch, right before the office crowd lunch rush (thankfully).  We shared a Beef Japchae $8.  I like that they don't pre-mix sesame seeds into the japchae.  They sprinkle it on top only if you want it.  The portion size of the Japchae was generous.  You get lots of noodles.  You also get lots of beef, and a bit of spinach and carrots.  The noodles were soft and full of flavour.  The whole dish was a little bit oily towards the bottom, but overall, was really good.  My mom said it was even better than Japchae she's had in Toronto!       

We ate a lot during our Montreal trip and our visit to Atti Express was towards the end of our trip, so we were good with just sharing 1 portion, but I would say that 1 order is probably not enough for 2 people in general, but more than enough for 1 person, unless you are very very hungry!  

So Atti Express is in the tunnel that connects Place Ville Marie to the Eaton Centre.  There are 2 restaurants side by side, Atti BBQ (which serves Korean Grilled items) and Atti Express which serves Bibimbap, Japchae and wraps.  Atti Express is definitely the most popular of the two.  In fact, Atti Express had a huge lineup and Atti BBQ was practically empty during the lunchtime rush.

Something else that I like about this place is that they have free serve yourself cold tea.  I think it's either corn tea or barley tea (kind of embarrassing that I can't tell, I know, lol, but it's very diluted, that's my excuse and I'm sticking with it).   

Staff were nice enough, both the cashier and the man preparing the food.  Most people were there for takeout, but they do have a number of seats, both tables for 2, and a big bench for large groups or communal eating."}
{"text":"Good korean option for a fast food. Their japcha is really good but is extremely filling. Their beef bibimbap taste good. Service is fast. For the downside. If you are not there before noon, the line is crazy long. The bibimbap  gets cold fast and the chicken bibimbap is not good. But I forgot to talk about their kimchi which is worth the price. And the sauces with the bibimbap are really good.

UPDATE: I've increased my rating to 5. I've been going there weekly and the service is really great. I also have to mention atti bbq which is just next door.  Food is great and the cashier is friendly and offers great service."}
{"text":"I have only been there once and never went back again. I don't see what's the hype about this place. Maybe because it's quick and there's no better Asian food in the complex. I took the beef deopbap. Worst meal I've had in Eaton in a long time. The beef was so so salty. Maybe they forgot that they already put soy sauce in that batch of beef and put it again or something. It came with a good quantity of rice but it wasn't enough. I was so thirsty by the middle of the meal, finishing it was actually a pain. The price is no doubt very reasonable, but for the same price I'd rather go to Kimchi in the food court, for a bigger quantity and a more even taste."}
{"text":"Very refreshing option for lunch compared to other fast food options. 
Very good Korean food, the portions are huge and the price is right!!! Had enough for lunch and dinner, the food is given in a convenient container easy to bring home.

Hard to find it is hidden in the tunnel between Eaton centrer and and Place Ville-Marie. There is a lineup for lunch...

Giving it 5 star for the fast food category and because it is the first review and they deserve it !!!!"}
{"text":"The lineup for lunch was huge but moved along nicely. I was there with a few friends and everyone was really happy with their dishes. About half got bibimbap, which is apparently the signature dish here, but the rest were extremely happy too. Not too many seats here, so we took our dishes to a nearby food court where we could get a table for 6. It's faster than sitting down in a restaurant - so great for lunchtime. I will probably come back, as this is the best Korean food I had in Montreal! I also want to try the restaurant and sit down for a proper meal when I get a chance."}
{"text":"The service is quick and the price is reasonable.  However, I found the chicken bibimbap lacking flavour.  The meat was dry, the rice was cold and it was missing the zing you would expect from Korean food.  It's a good simple option, but if you are looking for authentic Korean experience or food with some flavour I would recommend trying elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the best choice for Korean food. Bibimbap is my favourite with all the alternatives (Chicken, beef or Shrimps). Also a fan of Bokkeumbap. Usually this place is very busy at lunch time but i was served on time. Professional service at great prices."}
{"text":"Good express Korean. Quality is enough (as this is very simple) and the service is very quick.
For sure, I will never give any tips because they do not have the sense of the Service ! It's like a supply chain.

Anyhow, it stays that their plates are good. I've tried the Bibimbap (99% of their revenue) and the Japchae which is definitely my favorite (comes with beef and Pasta + carotts, salads, ...)

Even if you see many people in the queue, it goes very fast (around 5 min to take your order).

In summary, cheaper for the quality, but not a very good service level (is it what we ask for when we go to a fast food ?)."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch option at a very reasonable price. Had the beef bibimbap which included beef, rice and tons of vegetables.  Quite busy at lunch time but the line moved quickly and we did have a place to sit."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch ! It's fast and cheap and it tastes pretty legit and good ! I come here often since I work close and they even have a fidelity card to get a free bibimbap after buying 9, which let's face it, I complete every 6 months !"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful lunch option!

Even when the line seems to be never-ending, it shrinks really fast. I've been here a couple of times and the two things that impress me the most is the speed of the service and the low prices.

Food is pretty good too and different from what we eat in most other places. The choices are limited buy all of them are great! Plus, they have a loyalty card that gives you your 11th meal for free!

I would definitely recommend stopping by if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch spot located in the tunnel between Eaton Center and Place Ville Marie.  The menu is Korean and only features a handful of items but they are good.  I got a beef japchae to take back to my office and I enjoyed it.  It was well-seasoned and they didn't skimp on the beef.  The prices are on par with the food court and they did seem fair.  There are line-ups at lunch but don't be intimidated because they move fairly quickly.  Seating is limited so either arrive early or make plans to take your food elsewhere.  It isn't far from the Eaton Center food court so your best bet is to take the food there to eat."}
{"text":"In my opinion tastiest healthy lunch option available. I have been many times although I generally stick to beef bibimbap... tried chicken once, not doing that again... just not as good. Portions are big and satisfying. As for the price, pretty average for lunch. In my opinion you cant get anything better and as healthy for cheaper :) Definetly try it. One downside is that it is open just for lunch... not until 5 as it says on the website... very dissapointing going at 3h40 after class only to find out it is closed."}
{"text":"I finally made it here after attempting to go several times. The menu is simple yet something for everyone.

I was leaning towards the beef bibimbap and beef japchai and decided to go ahead with  the beef bibimbap, which is their lost popular dish. 
The presentation, taste, portion and price were great. I will definitely go back for lunch and try the beef japchai next time!


If you like Korean food, I strongly recommend this place.

Tips:
-They are only open at lunch and closed on evenings and weekends.
-Make sure to go before noon to secure a table/seat as is it does get very busy.  If not the line goes pretty fast.
- Make sure to try the beef bibimbap!"}
