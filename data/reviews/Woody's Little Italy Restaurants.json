{"text":"Excellent restaurant!  I am a McKeesport native now living in another state.  On my all-too-infrequent return visits to the area I often try to stop in to Woody's Little Italy for lunch or dinner.  I find that it has consistently offered one of the best dining experiences in the Pittsburgh area or anywhere else!  The food, from pizza to more high-end traditional Italian fare, is of high quality and typically in ample portions.  A wide range of selections are available from a variety of styles, each with its own merit.  Authentic Italian-style preparation for many of the dishes is a treat.  Service is typically very good, even when the facility is full and quite busy.  When Woody himself was still alive, he was often visible and personally attended to business not only in the kitchen but in the dining areas; his table-side chats with diners kept his finger on the pulse of their needs and opinions.  It has been my experience that the careful attention to detail and customer satisfaction has fortunately continued after his passing.  The location is neat and clean and comfortable, quite appropriate for the nature of the business. For a restaurant to attain and maintain such a consistent, high quality level of service for so many decades is impressive!  I look forward to future dining opportunities at Woody's Little Italy, and to even enjoy the \"scenic\" view of the Boston Bridge!"}

{"text":"Great food exceptional service. I have had every veal dish on the menu. I have to say they have the best veal in the city.  Weekly specials are creative and worth every penny."}
{"text":"I'm still waiting for a manager to contact me regarding the 2 inch piece of aluminum foil cutter we found in the gnocchi we purchased for my daughter's graduation party in June.  The person accepting the equipment returns from my husband seemed not to be able to care less and he asked that a manager contact me. Very disappointing when you spend over $2,000 in catering. Catering set up, people setting up, quantity and quality of food was great. The jagged piece of metal is truly tarnishing what was otherwise a great experience."}
{"text":"Restaurant full but cleared out early. Service very good. I had prime rib, wedding soup, veggies and an additional salad. Spouse had eggplant parmesan with a side of pasta. Generous portions, decent presentation."}
{"text":"Like planning any event, looking for a place to throw my sister's baby shower was difficult. We needed enough room, adequate space on the tables and, of course, delicious food. This place had it all.  It was cozy, yet elegant. There's a fireplace between the two dining areas that can be turned on and this gives it a little something special. The restaurant is just lovely. Now, getting to the important stuff. We had a standard catered buffet lunch that included their Italian Wedding Soup (delicious)  sandwich fixin's and buns/bread (delicious and fresh) a giant salad (amazing, fresh - both the ranch and Italian dressings were delicious) and we ordered a red-sauce penne for a hot side. The sauce was delicious. The penne cooked to perfection. Everything went without a hitch. Now for the really important part. The wait staff (Tracy and Tracey!) were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. There was nothing they couldn't/wouldn't do for us from the time we came to set up the shower until they were helping pack up everything at the end. I have never in my life felt so special and taken care of at an event. Wonderful. I've eaten here on many occasions (I'm from this neighborhood, so I've been eating here since I was a child) and the food, staff and atmosphere never disappoint. Especially if you're looking for a venue for an event, go here!"}
{"text":"Seated late with reservations.  Our wait for the our main course was unacceptable.  Seated at 0745 and our dinner didn't hit the table until 9pm.   Owner admitted that the chef passed over our table to serve smaller parties.  I will never step foot in Woodys ever again.    Sub par food followed by BS service.   There are too many other options  for good Italian in the area."}
{"text":"I had a very unfortunate dinner at Woody's this past weekend.  I had ordered their king cut of prime rib.  When I had got it it was tougher than leather to cut, which is really strange because of how prime rib is usually prepared.  When I got though it the meat was totally raw.  Not under cooked, but raw.    When I had alerted the waitress she had asked me if I wanted another cut or for it to be re-heated.  I asked for another piece of meat as it was really tough to begin with and I had put a large cut in the middle of the steak, so it would over cook that area.    When I had gotten it back it was the same cut of meat.  Where I had cut it the meat was well done, but cutting into it in another area it was still rare, bordering on raw and I had asked for medium rare.  When I had alerted the waitress she just asked me if I wanted something else and took it off our bill.    What upset me more than anything though was the fact nobody came over to say anything.  Does this place have a General Manager?  How does someone get their steak sent back twice and nobody comes over to the table to say anything?  Does the customer have to be rude and belligerent for someone who's job that would be to say something to the customer?  This place has really poor management to allow that to happen.  I will never return."}
{"text":"My favorite sauce, good pizza. Only wish they had wings too! Often have dinner there and also take out. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I was a small child. Back in the day when their dinning room chairs had green carpeting on the backs of the high back, white leather, swivel chairs! Those were the days. Okay so the decor is a little more up to date now but the food hasn't changed! Obviously they have a great red sauce but my personal favorite is the wedding soup. I have been eating it for over 20 years and it never gets old! Family owned by great people. My favorite dish is the chicken Isabella on my gosh it's a must have!"}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant around. Great food,large portions for the price. Staff is very nice."}
{"text":"I have loved Woody's for a long time! The food is always amazing!! I highly recommended you give it a try! My favorite in house is Zucchini Parmesean. ?. My favorite catering item is Candied Spareribs! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had a small wedding party yesterday and I can't thank you enough for making our wedding so special. The manager Dan is very professional and cool! The manager and waitress provided exceptional service and were very patient to us that day. There were 5 kids running around and they absolutely had things under control. Customer services is A++++. Every guest love their food. Huge portion of food and guests love that they could take home the left over. Highly recommended for small wedding and catering. Definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Sunday @ 5:30p. Party of 5. Very well travelled and experienced diners. The eggplant entree was disgusting with far too much breading. It was not eaten but still was on the bill. Decent restaurants would have removed it immediately with apologies.The pork chop special was floating in a dark sauce with burnt undertastes. Sad. Comical though when the fork bent in half trying to cut the chops! Why do so many Americans over cook pork? Soup was OK. Salads were ordinary with too much iceberg. Better greens are needed. We were too afraid to risk dessert. Woodys has been around a long time. Time for a complete review of its operation if it intends to present notable Italian food. Diners are becoming more sophisticated. But maybe it will just stay local for local tastes. Who knows?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local Italian places. Food is consistent, love everything from their enormous melt in your mouth prime rib dinner to the delicious chicken parm, wedding soup is excellent, as are their apps..I also love their pizza...I've not had a bad meal from Woodys and the service is always excellent!"}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest experiences we have enjoyed.  The Wedding Soup is the best in the area and the food is known by all as great.  Service is exceptional and we have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I've lived here for about three years finally stopped at Woody's and I was not disappointed. Everything was fresh, was really nice,the salad was awesome my eggplant Parmesan was cooked to perfection. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Gulp! For a dinner that started off so promising. So the fiancée and I went here on a Tuesday night (which is their $5.99 spaghetti night). We wanted to try their food because we thought they might be an option as a caterer for our wedding based on a few loose recommendations.  We pulled into the parking lot and it was fairly crowded for a Tuesday in December.  We sat quickly and Bobbi our sever was prompt with drinks and service all night.   The fiancée and I were debating on food, as we wanted to try some dishes that we saw on the catering menu. So we were going to go with chicken Marsala and baked ziti. Well Bobbi heard us talking about the chicken diablo (which is made with Marsala wine). She said it was very tasty, I asked if it was similar to the Marsala, and no was the answer.  Order was in and we were psyched!!!  Salad and wedding soup were to the table faster than the flash.   Wedding soup was above average and dinner salad well was a side salad, no issues. But the star was the blue cheese. It was CHUNKY!! Just the way I liked it, and at this point I thought we may have found a caterer, then the drop came.   Dinner came out, the Marsala and side of spaghetti for the fiancée and my Chicken Diablo. We looked at  each other with a puzzled look, which our waitress noticed. The Marsala & diablo were literally the same dish except mine had banana peppers and pasta in the dish instead of on the side.   So we ventured into this dishes hoping they would be tantalizing. The red sauce for pasta, was passable.   The Marsala and Diablo both had more bell peppers than mushrooms, (now I've never eaten my Marsala with peppers and now I know why). Mushrooms should be the star of this dish. Also the chicken in both dishes tasted like frozen chicken tenders that were heated in the microwave, with that hard microwave chicken taste. So an epic fail on entrees.  Now I will give them this Bobbi was a great server, and food came out prompt. We were there for only 45 minutes. But we thought it was weird that the parking lot was packed at 630 and at 715 it looked like a ghost town when we left.   So moral to the trip if you like American Italian from 20 years ago, (or don't like seasoning) you are in luck. But for $55 bill if rather spend my dollar elsewhere and pick a different caterer."}
{"text":"Got seated right away but they were crowded. My husband got the veal parmesan with meat sauce and I got the Mediterranean chicken pasta. Portions were huge and came with soup or salad and warm Italian bread. The dressings were excellent; we tried the honey French, the ranch and the house Italian, all three were delicious! My meal was simply delicious, but I couldn't barely put a dent in it, the was so much! My husband enjoyed his veal and said the sauce was good."}
{"text":"Celebrated Mother's Day with a group of 8.  Place is cute but they had the air conditioner blowing right on our table.  Scary start but it got better.  Banana peppers were good.  Sausage spring roll was AMAZING!!! We ordered all sorts of stuff.  Seafood risotto, lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, prime rib, and cheesesteak hoagies.  All were pretty good.  Got dessert to go.  Peanut butter pie.  Yum."}
{"text":"The wife and I have eaten hear a few times. Good Italian fare. Many folks like their pizza. The table next to us ordered a calzone which looked like it could feed a small country. Tonight our orders were absolutely fantastic. On Wednesday the special is Gnocci. Judee ordered this with red sauce and a meatball. All was very good. Their red sauce is a little on the sweet side, just the way I like it. My meal was one of the best I have ever had, the \"Grilled Chicken Carbonara\". As the menu stated is was pancetta, onions al dente with garlic in a white wine sauce - well put together and did not separate.. This was over rigatoni al dente with a chicken breast from a real charcoal grill. The flavor was to die for... House garden salad with balsamic vinaigrette was fresh and crisp.  Restrooms and restaurant is clean.  Stop in and have a meal before or after your bike ride on the Great Allegheny Passage nearby."}
{"text":"We loved our Woody's experience.  First, ambiance - it's small, but not in a quaint way, it was pretty chilly in the dining room and the tables are quite small...  the kind where if there are four of you, you put the center carousel on the next table.  Bread, so fresh and warm and good.  On to the appetizer, we had the Sicilian Spring Roll.  It was huge, savory and perfect for four of us to share.  This could be an entrée, easy.  Salads were nothing to crow about, lots of iceberg with some fresh veggies.  However, the dressings are extremely flavorful.  Potato soup was a large serving and given a big thumbs up.  I had the Chicken Isabella - it was huge and also provided lunch later in the week.  It was a beautiful presentation with cheese, sautéed spinach and topped with shrimp.  So good.  Side veggies tasted very good but were extremely soft.  Hubs had pasta with meatballs and sausage - he loved the sauce.  Friend1 had Chicken Parm and loved his meal.  Friend2 had gnocchi chicken, huge portion described as delicious!   We ordered a small pizza for our son who declared it to be a winner.  Our server was happy and engaging and attentive - we will definitely go back and so should you!"}
{"text":"Loved the lasagna however the last 2 times I ordered it was cold in middle.  First time we were given free dessert, this time nothing offered.  Food is very good --- just make sure it is hot!!!!"}
