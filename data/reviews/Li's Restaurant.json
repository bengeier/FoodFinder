{"text":"Li's restaurant is in a great location right in the middle of the town centre. It would not really be suitable for the less mobile as you need to go up loads of steep steps to get to the restaurant itself. Food is really nice and they have quite an extensive menu considering how small the restaurant actually is. Prices are good at all times but great if you can manage to get one of their set menus. They do a really reasonable set lunch which is great value for money. Less choice than main menu but still a good selection. Staff are nice and friendly and place itself is clean"}

{"text":"Brilliant little restaurant hidden in the Main Street! Had many deliveries before I eventually found it they have about 10 tables which makes for a cosy feel. All the food I've eaten has been great salt & chillier chickens wings ... Sweet n sour or curry chicken! Found the service  fast & very staff friendly."}
