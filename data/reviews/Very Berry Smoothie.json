{"text":"I personally think this place is better than pulp.   Hands down. They have such a wide variety of smoothies and that are incredibly delicious. My favorite smoothie so far is Tahini Genie. The Crantastic is really good especially if you get the energy booster with it. It has the perfect tartness. This place is definitely a must go to. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great smoothie joint that's locally owned and not just a chain store."}
{"text":"The smoothies are great and the staff always lets me make substitutes if needed especially because I don't like yogurt in my smoothies. 

Why 4 stars? They don't always open according to the hours posted. One day this didn't open until 9:30am and their hours said 9:00am. 

Other than that, I will continue to come here just in the afternoon when I'm sure they are open."}
{"text":"At the suggestion of Kathy R's Yelp review, I stopped into Very Berry Smoothie to try the Chunky Monkey smoothie... and I was not disappointed. Anything with peanut butter and banana is a winning combination for me. The flavorful peanut butter hit my taste buds just right and the consistency was nice and thick. A small size filled me up completely to the point where I wasn't hungry for lunch. It was seriously addictive. Be careful, or you'll drink it super quick and get a brain freeze.

Very Berry is tucked away in the corner of Solon Square. You can enter the door from the front (park near the corner of the parking lot near the cupcake shop) or from the back off of Station Street (park near the yoga studio). The interior is very bright and cheerful with a huge menu. If you're looking for literally any type of smoothie, you can find it here. They also have salads and wraps available, though I didn't try one.

I love having smoothies available in Solon. The gentleman helping me was very friendly and talked me through some of his favorites on the menu. I was in and out of there pretty speedily, and the prices were more than fair. I'll definitely come back in the near future! Especially if i'm taking a class at the neighboring Oasis Yoga Spa. Very Berry is very delicious."}
{"text":"Love the food and smoothies here. I was in on a Tuesday and the brunette made me the banana smoothie. It was my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Very Berry has been a great addition to Solon.  With literally no where else in the city to get a fresh made smoothie, this place was needed!  Placed in the same plaza at Planet Fitness and Oasis Yoga, it is really convenient for me to grab a smoothie after a workout! My favorite is their Hungry Monkey smoothie.  It is a combination of banana, chocolate milk, protein powder and peanut butter.  I highly recommend it.  The owner is very nice and you have the option to call them and pre order your smoothie!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to when you are feeling healthy.   Ironically, it's right next to the White Flour Cake Shop. 
 
Talk about the angel and devil on your shoulders, which do I choose?
When I do make the \"right\" choice, I love getting an avocado goddess smoothie. This is one of their performance smoothies.  They have several categories of smoothies: 
Classic, seasonal, low fat,  performance, sweet, and super smoothies.   
 
Each of thee smoothies could be enhanced with the following: 
Whey Protein (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry)
Soy Protein (vanilla)
Vitamin-C Immunity Booster 
Ground Flax Seed
Whole Grain Rolled Oats
 Energy Booster - B12
Weight Management - Fiber
 Multi-Vitamin
Chia Seeds
Peanut or Almond Butter
Nutella
Extra Fruit
 
WARNING: read the nutritional information.  Some of these smoothies can have up to 700 + calories.  Don't make the mistake I made.  I ordered one of these blindly and I was so upset for the rest of the day.  That's like half of my calories for a day!
 
They also have a decent selection of healthy wraps and sandwiches if you aren't into a liquid diet.  
Overall, the smoothies taste good, the salads are fresh, and the place is clean.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with my first visit here! My coworker came back to work yesterday with a salad and it looked so good I had to try  it! They don't have an extensive food menu but all the salads and wraps are 5 bucks! They are willing to customize your salad for you and the salads are a generous size with meat and cheese on it! They definitely have a return customer as far as salads go. Maybe next time I'll try a smoothie."}
