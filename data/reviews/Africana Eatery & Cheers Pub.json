{"text":"Always had very good, helpful service, and very much enjoy everything I've had from the menu.  Frequently recommend to others."}
{"text":"Bad service. Hours say open till 11. Got there at 1030 and was refused service. All I wanted was a plate of ribs and I was denied"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after hearing about it from a colleague. I was fold that what this place lacks in aesthetics it makes up with quality food. I was lied too. After ordering 4 different plates I'd have to say one was worth paying for (the fries). The other 3 (ribs wings and skewers ) seemed to have been fresh out of the freezer and microwaved to room temp.  The service I received was embarrassing considering there was only 3 groups in the restaurant. I'd avoid spending your hard earned cash on what seems to be pre cooked frozen food. The owner needs to change the name to afriCANTa"}
{"text":"The maharaj platter was super delicious. You get to sample: lamb, shrimp, chicken, beef kebab and ribs. It also has very little starch on the side; ie masala fries & casava!
You definitely need to order some veggies on the side which comes with roti & rice & we ordered the okra which was really really good!!
On the flip side, we asked for naan on the side & asked the meal be hot but everything was actually mildly flavored...I guess you have to dig into their sauces to add a little heat!
The platter was $45 which was a good price for all that food!!
I will most certainly go back to try a different platter!
Totally recommend the food!
Poor ambience though :S"}
