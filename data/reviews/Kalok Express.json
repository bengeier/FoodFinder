{"text":"Choose your owns options for the cart noodles is the best with the curry saurce.
HK style milk tea is not bad too"}
{"text":"If you are from HK and if you like    \" CAR BOY NOODLE\", you need to try this food court out. Authentic taste of HK!"}
{"text":"The sharks fin soup is very similar to authentic HK style imitated sharks fin soup (add the fresh fish paste)

The cart noodles take awhile to make but it has lots of variety, and how it tastes really depends on your own taste and what you put it in, it's worth a try! 

The fish balls, and HK style snacks are good and brings back lots of memories...

I always pass by this at the food court, now I always grab something from here."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite First Markham Place food court place now!! If you lived in Hong Kong before, you will understand why ??? (Cart Noodle or DIY HK Style Noodle) is so loved in the city!!  Incase you wonder what this noodle dish is, it is a dish you as the consumer can pick whatever combinations you want for your noodle soup.  Usually you pick a type of noodle with 2-3 topics from a list of selections and you have yourself a legit Cart Noodle.  If you know you stuff, getting the thick yellow noodle aka Hakka Noodle is a MUST, then top it with my personal favourite: pork skin, fish skin dumplings and fish tofu or red sausages with a little bit of curry sauce, you have yourself an amazing ???!!  The noodle texture is amazing, the curry sauce is spicy!! Reminds me of the HK curry.  Also their fish skin dumplings are one of the best I ever had in Toronto.  If you ask me, I strongly believe this is one of the best ??? places in Toronto. You can now also add $1 in exchange for a HK Style Fin Soup which is another Hong Kong local favourite street food!"}
{"text":"As far as food court spots go, this is probably one of my top 3 go to's at the First Markham Place plaza. It's Hong Kong quick meals and snack foods; all your favourites at a decent price. 

I usually just grab a skewer of curry fish balls and a skewer of curry beef balls. Their sauce has a spicy kick to it that is flavourful and a bit addicting. Be warned, there's tons of oil! But all the yummy HK snack foods usually do.

I also decided to grab dinner here one time. Normally I order a soup or something from a near by korean spot and just grab snacks from here, but this time I figured I should try other menu items being offered. Their wonton noodles were alright. The wontons were chewy, but didn't have the bounce that we love so much. The noodles tasted different. I'm not sure if it was the broth or the noodles themselves but it was a nice warm flavour to it. 

Not too salty and not over done. They just keep it quick and simple. :) 
I like the lower pricing and good portion. Portions are decent for someone like me that really doesn't eat too much anyway, but for someone who is maybe a person of larger appetite, this will most likely not be enough."}
{"text":"If one likes the idea of choosing one's own ingredients for the Noodle Soup, then this is the place to go.  The Noodle Soup comes with soy milk.  And if one is willing to pay $1.00 extra, one can get a bowl of so called \"Sharks Fin Soup\".(regular price, $3.00 per bowl)  It even offers choice of noodles, see the photos.  So this is Hong Kong style \"Cart Noodle Soup\" all about.  The 4 star rating is solely based on food."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5 stars.

Kalok Express is a noodle and snack food booth.  It sells soup noodles, cart noodles, lo meins, a few rice entrees and traditional Chinese snacks.  The pricing is on par with other noodle places in the same mall.  I ordered their cart noodle because I wanted a healthy combination.  I had vermicelli (non fried, so it was healthier than egg noodle), fish cake slices (the lower fat protein among the options) and Chinese broccoli (an usual option among cart noodle places).  The result was a cleanly and delicately tasted soup noodle in the picture.  The portion was sufficient.  The ingredients were fresh.

I rate Kalok Express as 3.5 stars because it has a relatively bigger selection of vegetables in the cart noodle menu.  I have yet to try their other wonton and dumpling soup noodles, so I shall return."}
{"text":"Looks like there has been some new stalls that recently opened in the First Markham Place food court. Kalok Express is one of two recent openings in the food court, the other being Noodle Soup.

Kalok Express serves mostly Hong Kong-style snacks, similar to the street food stalls you used to see everywhere in HK. It's a unique addition to the food court, as you can order an entree from another food stall, then order some extra snacks from Kalok Express, as the prices are quite cheap here.

The first time I tried Kalok Express, I had the cart noodles, where you get to pick your noodles and ingredients you want to add. The cart noodles are okay for food court quality, but I've had better out there. The second time, I tried their curry fish balls. Their curry is quite spicy, so if your spice tolerance is low, I would try something else. However I found it to be quite tasty and reminiscent of HK street food. 

They have a lot of other snacks that are worth trying, and I do believe this is an excellent addition to the FMP food court."}

best beef brisket noodle in toronto

great noodles too... for $7... that's the best lunch around for the price"}
{"text":"Came here at 11:50am on Sunday and the food court was still pretty quiet. But this hk style noodle place had 2 ppl working but took them 15mins to make a fishball seedwee soup. Tasted normal, not bad but not wow. For the hot hk milk tea, thry put sugar for you and its too sweet, make sure you ask for less sugar if you prefer it not as sweet."}
{"text":"Kalok is one of those foodcourt shops that you get addicted to for possibly no reason besides the fact that it's there and you know what you want.

Kalok is pretty good all around.  I do love how spicy their curry fishballs are :) 
I get their cart noodles, where you get to choose your toppings - yum.
Their deep fried fish skin is A-OK but it does get old pretty fast.  

They're pretty fast, considering they do get somewhat of a lineup during lunch. 

My #1 option in FMP."}
{"text":"Maybe I should not have that much expectation for Kalok Express as a stall in a food court. I do like the selections and the price is reasonable.

Shrimp Wonton Noodle ($5.50) was quite disappointed though. The wontons were balls of hard meat with mushy texture, I could not find those \"fresh\"  shrimps. The noodle though was cooked good with a nice bite.  That bowl of noodle is definitely a 2 star.

I might give them another try? Cart Noodle might be more promising? Just skip the wontons."}
