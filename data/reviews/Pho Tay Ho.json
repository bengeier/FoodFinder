{"text":"Sooo good! Best pho and viet. food I've have in the city so far. So flavorful and fresh! It's really amazing!"}
{"text":"Great Pho place. The service was rude, but the food will have us coming back :)

The rare beef+well done brisket was on e of the best I've tasted in Montreal.

I also tried the meat and vegetable one and it was really  good; vegetables were nicely grilled while still crunchy :) yum."}
{"text":"Came here on a sunny Sunday afternoon looking for something light and delicious to eat. 

The portion size was insane, which I loved! The broth was really light and not too salty or overpowering, or fatty. 

The beef pho was so good, wasn't so keen on the tripe but managed to eat around it as it was pretty small. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered the special chicken noodle. What makes it special? The fact that the cow rolled over the chicken that crossed the road that ended up in my bowl of noodle soup. Slices of raw beef flank topped the bowl that featured pieces of chicken both large and small. To make this order of Pho Ga double special, was the fact that I got the one chicken gizzard, liver and heart. I know what you're thinking, \"how can one bowl of noodle soup contain so much awesome without exploding singing hot soup all over your tshirt\". Subsequent soup spatter did however end up on my shirt - that's only because I'm clumsy. The added offal added a rich and deeper flavour to the soup - it's not for everyone, just the ridiculously good-looking.

Pho Tay Ho has been at this location for as long as I can remember, and as long as I can remember, the food has always tasted the same. Consistency doesn't seem to an issue for them as their formula for deliciousness cannot go wrong. Not only do they specialize in chicken pho, but subsequently all things chicken, various chicken dishes on the menu can be found. You can disagree, but like I said before, Pho is the ultimate blitz, there are so many variations that each place will surely be different from another and that's something I can guarantee. That's why you'd got to try them all before you find the one you like... like dating."}
{"text":"Best Pho and other authentic vietnamese specialities in Montreal! Its a first come first serve no reservation. Always potential line up but really worth the wait because all their food are fresh and tasty! The personel are kind, quick and professional.
Discover new authentic vietnamese food by asking chef's suggestions."}
{"text":"pho ga is best here. I've tried pho almost everywhere in montreal & this place would have to be the best. The spring rolls weren't so great but if your hungry for some good vietnamese pho, this is the place to be. The broth & chicken meat is good. The restaurant is always busy & full of vietnamese people so thats also a good sign."}
{"text":"Worth the dollars! Generous in portions. If you're like me and loves me some chicken, beef or pork with some hot steaming rice, this is the place you need to try. It's HUGE!!! Thanks Tay Ho for satisfying my hunger."}
{"text":"I ordered a summer roll and a vermicelli bowl with pork and spring rolls.

Summer roll had chicken and shrimp in it and I would have preferred no chicken (but that's just personal preference). The summer roll was very fresh and tasty. Didn't taste pre-made (i.e. the rice paper was very sticky and fresh).

The reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the fish sauce was way too sugary. I usually pour all of the fish sauce into the bowl but this time I couldn't finish the bowl because the sauce just overpowered everything with a sweet taste. However, compared to other places I've been, the quality and taste of the meat, veggies, and overall taste of the bowl (excluding the fish sauce) was very, very good. I would definitely come back and also recommend this place.

Pro - food comes out very fast.

Cons - waited a bit around lunch time for a seat. Line to pay moves slow and no one seems to be in a rush. Resto was very crowded with people and staff walking around constantly."}
{"text":"My favorite vietnamese resto, not just a Pho place...

I have been coming here for years. Back in the day, a bowl of Pho was around 5$, prices have gone up quite a bit since, but you can still get a good meal here with a drink for less than 20$ taxes and tips included, which is still a huge deal!!!

The Pho really shine here, both the Chicken and Tai Nam variety. My tip for you is: ASK THEM TO PUT KAFIR LIME LEAVES IN YOUR PHO, no matter which option you pick. The lime leaves will bring out a new dimension to all the flavors... trust me just try it :) (I'm vietnamese and grew up eating this stuff). 

For me, this is the best Pho in town, it is consistently good. Pho is a very fussy thing to make well consistently, if you ever go to a pho place regularly you will notice sometimes the taste is off. For this place though when it's off it's still good, and when it's on, there's just no better.

This place is famous for the Tay Ho special bbq dish,  (Bun cha Tay Ho), it comes with different types of grilled meats soaked in fish sauce, vermicelli and a heap of herbs, mix everything in a bowl and eat, the fun part is to mix different herbs each time, add some fish sauce and voila!!!

Another signature dish is the \"Cha ca\" dish, it's grilled tumeric spiced fish on a hot plate, served with vermicelli and a heap of fried onions and dill. This one you eat with a shrimp paste sauce. The flavors in this dish is very pungent, definitely an acquired taste, be mindful if you want to try. But those who like shrimp paste, you will like this dish.

Try also the iced coffee, viet style, yum."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Came there in late lunch times but still packed. Ordered a pho and two menus starting with Ban. The flavor of the soup was very deep and had a lot of meat inside. The soup wasn't the taste that I had when I stayed in Vietnam tbh but still very good. Ban's I ordered 27 and 31. BBQ was the best dish that  I had in the past whole month. All reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese food we've ever had. Even the won ton soup was so good we ate every drop - who does that with won ton soup? The sauces are light and fresh and flavorable, and the vegetables are plentiful. We'd go back here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Best chicken pho in Montreal. The broth is so tasty filled with herbs!"}
{"text":"Je me suis rendu ici grâce à trip advisor et quelle découverte une soupe au buf saignant délicieuse pas cher en plus beaucoup de viandes très copieuse des aliments frais un service impeccable une belle terrasse très agréable en été 
Un incontournable de Montréal pour les amateurs de soupe tonkinoise"}
{"text":"Cest un bon petit restaurant sympa mais rien de plus . La soupe est bonne le decor nice , le service est rapide et agreable."}
{"text":"When we read the adverts in the vietnamese montreal newspapers to seek out pho in montreal, it was a foreboding sign when we saw that restaurants were using \"chef from toronto\" as a marketing strategy....  we already had low expections since the realization that we might not find pho worthy of our acclimatized toronto-pho tastebuds. We initially wanted to try some of the famous pho restaurants in the chinatown area but were referred to pho tay ho by a banh mi shop owner. it's a little pho shop out of downtown but it was well worth the drive.

The pho ga (chicken) broth is excellent. It rivals the best pho in toronto and albeit pricey compared to toronto pho, the bowl is steaming hot, generous portions of onions and cilantro, the meat is fresh, and the portions mighty.  It leaves such a lasting impression that sometimes I think another bowl would be worth the 8-hour trek to montreal."}
{"text":"Excellente bouffe, pas trop cher. Légumes et herbes de qualités. Portions généreuses. Souvent, le restaurant se remplis rapidement après 17h, alors prévoyez le coup. Recommandable!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the broth here. So rich and flavourful!! I had the rare beef, chicken and giblet pho and it was delicious until I bit into a piece of liver that had not been completely cleaned of bile...every other bite was a pure delight."}
{"text":"chicken and vegetable pho.  Pho sure. 

so fresh, so soothing and healing and healthy and salty and saucy and affordable.

i've gone back for this over and over again.  

I wish they delivered as I would be getting it on a weekly basis if that were the case."}
{"text":"fantastic perfect pho and other viet favourites.

fast efficient smart service

definitely try te tay ho salad

also try the phos with vegetables- the vegetables are grilled and give a wonderful flavour the to already great broth."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Texas. Now I'm back and I can't stop thinking about that raw beef salad! So delicious!!"}
{"text":"With so many pretenders to the Tonkin soup throne in Montreal, every one has their favourite Pho place, right? Here's why this is yours. 

The breadth and depth of the stock is what sets Tay Ho apart. It's meaty and marrowy, with no trace of the false kick of MSG that so often mars that of other establishments. Served with a beautiful arrangement of thai basil, bean sprouts and lime wedges, you can season the basic meat, broth noodle combo to your taste. 

For grilled meat enthusiasts there is also a remarkable (and huge) pork bun dish, with the rare beef salad also a must."}
{"text":"Extremely soothing and comforting chicken toniknese soup! The noodle is thick and cooked to perfection, and the chicken is lean and flavorful. The Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk is a must."}
{"text":"Not sure I'm raving about this place, yes it tastes nice and flavoursome though not the best Vietnamese I've ever had akso the service was poor today. Really didn't feel welcomed, we had to tell some of our orders were missing otherwise we would have been overcharged."}
{"text":"I don't know much about Vietnamese food, but I do know that we really enjoyed what we got here: a huge dish of grilled skewers of shrimp, chicken and beef over vermicelli with an abundance of bean sprouts, herbs, and lettuce (for wrap-making, we determined, after we'd all but demolished it), another huge dish of sauteed veggies over crispy fried noodles in a sweet, light sauce, and a bowl of juicy BBQ'ed pork. Between two reasonably hungry adults (and one not-so-hungry toddler), we still had a serving of leftovers to take home with us. Friendly service, if a bit cursory (mainly involving rushing by to grab your order sheet and confirm that you've chosen what you think you've chosen). We're just visiting Montreal, but we'd likely come back again next time we're in town and staying in the area."}
{"text":"Well this was a pleasant surprise!  After suffering through many truly awful versions of purportedly Vietnamese food in Toronto and (gasp!) Florida my expectations were pretty much subterranean.

The specialty of the house is the Chicken Pho (Pho Ga) and it actually is pretty darn special here.  I had all but given up ordering the chicken variety in most places as I end up with bowls of bullion buffeted by blanched bleached bundles of chicken meat formerly known as dark. The broth here is, for lack of a more colorful descriptor - real.  The Goi Ga is also not to be missed - a cool salad that is superb for a summer day.  Or sometime in the endless winter when your just in denial.  

Surprisingly, yet highly recommended.



DEAR MONTREAL YELP FRIENDS -  

There IS excellent Vietnamese in Toronto - you just need to Yelp a few to avoid the many, many, many potential pitfalls."}
{"text":"We ate lunch here after visting Marché Jean-Talon (market).

There is seating outside in front and back. We sat in the outside in the back.

We ordered:

Appetizer: Beef tartar - this was good comes with onion, peanuts, and fried rice crackers to eat with beef
pho - this was not very good. Soup was a bit bland.
Vermincelli with shrimp shewers and pork chop - this was much better than the pho. It also comes with a good amount of mint, bean sprouds, asian basel.

They don't take credit card like most asian places."}
{"text":"Holy shit, holy shit, oh my god. terrific. that beef -- are you fucking kidding me?!? that was absolutely insane"}
{"text":"Unusually nicer and cleaner interior at Pho Tay Ho, as a Vietnamese eatery.

There isn't much talking between a waiter and you since all you need to do is to select your order on an order form and voilà, within a minute, food come out to your table, nice and hot!

Bun Bo Nuong Cha Gio - Grilled lemongrass beef, spring rolls, vermicelli noodles, pickled carrot, vegetables, piles of Thai basil, mint leaves & cilantro, crushed roasted peanuts and nuoc mam(fish sauce), all were barely fit for the bowl! Smoky and sweet flavor, I LIKE!  This restaurant is generous with its portions: piles of thick cut grilled beef was very satisfying with a bunch of - literally a bunch! - cilantro, Thai basil, and mint. I'm sure you will love it too if a herb lover like me.

Pho Dac Biet - Pho with rare and cooked beef, beef balls, tendons and tripe. Thai basil, sprouts, and two little Thai chili peppers crushed by my big spoon, into my soup; OMG it was one wonderful meal! Not the best broth compared to Pho Lien, but the rice noodles had unusual great texture; lots of basil & mint leaves & hot chili peppers are given to tables; the portion of meat was just enough; and most of all the place was nice and clean, plus recently renovated along with new tables and chairs! 9.5/10 LOL!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the great reviews, but unfortunately the place did not live up to the hype. I got the  beef and chicken mix pho .... The meat was grisselly poor quality, and really tough. It was like all the parts of the meat you throw away more skin and cartilage  than meat. I also thought the broth tasted a little bland. The raw beef salad was really tasty. I could have skipped this place and found a lot better places. Like pho Saigon vip.. they make a killer pho"}
{"text":"Small little restaurant that satisfied my pho craving. 
Came here on an extremely cold night, looking for a nice bowl of pho, I was not disappointed. The restaurant was packed at 7pm, the two of us got lucky got seated within 5 min here. Ordered two pho Dac biet and shrimp rolls. Nothing fancy but always comforting. Food came pretty fast too. Big portion, the broth do taste different from the ones in toronto, doesn't have as much flavoring, not as complex?? but still good. The tendons are very chewy, as if they were undercooked air dried tendon, we could not bite through them at all. The beef were very fatty, they weren't sliced very thinly, somehow I enjoyed the fat lol. The meal was very good overall, we were too cold and tired, we felt great afterward.

The service here was great, fast and attentive staff. One other thing I was very impressed was how clean their utensil were. The steel tea pot was shiny and spot less, not even any water mark on it. I thought it was only that single one we got. When we were paying at the front, I saw a whole stack of teapot and cups just as clean and shiny as they ones we got. They deserve an award for that!

Not the best pho I've ever had, but I was highly impressed with my meal and experience. Will recommend."}
{"text":"I hate to give places bad reviews but my experience here was disappointing starting with the customer service or lack thereof. You get a slip of paper and mark off your orders, although the food came pretty quick, no one came by to check up on is if everything was ok. They were pretty loud talking amongst themselves and as we were trying to pay, it felt like no one wanted to get up and ring us out. The place is away from the touristy places but the prices I find was still a bit high. $3.00 for ONE goi cuon? I thought that roll better be amazing, but it wasn't (scroll through pic from other yelpers). We've had really good authentic pho before, but the broth for this place was bland. I can't imagine how a place like this can have 4 1/2 stars. They're not even close. I would never come back it even recommend this place."}
{"text":"The pho here is exceptional, it is very different from other pho restaurants.

The rice noodles are thinner and a little more elastic comparing to other places, they are not shy with the coriander leaves and spring onions in the bowl. Also, they are very generous with the thai basil and the bean sprout, I love it.

The portions are huge, I had the medium bowl and it is comparable to the large size that other places serve. However, size doesn't mean anything, what makes their pho truly amazing is the broth, and it is by far the most refreshing broth I've ever had. I don't think they added anything else other than salt to that broth once it comes out of the big pot, and that's the way it should be. There is no artificial MSG taste like some of the pho restaurants in downtown.

The place is packed during dinner time and I was quite amazed with how many tables they were able to fit inside the restaurant. The place is much bigger on the inside than it seems on the outside.

The service was almost nonexistent, instead of having waiters take your orders you just write them down on a printed menu. They have all sorts of condiments and a whole plate of thai chilis, I'm assuming all this was to make it easier for the customers while not having too many waiters walking around in a confined space.

I will definitely come back to try out other dishes, apparently their pho is just the tip of the iceberg."}
{"text":"Pho is a core part of my diet. Especially on those colder fall/winter nights, nothing beats a good bowl of Pho. That's why Pho Tay Ho, has become a trusted neighbourhood spot for the fam and me. 

This place tends to get very busy, so I personally prefer coming on slower week nights. As opposed to some of the other Pho restaurants in town, the staff here is great and quite accommodating when we come, even with the newborn. 

From Pho to rice noodle bowls and tremendous rice plates, we are never disappointed when we come. If you're new to Vietnamese, go for a spring roll, the raw beef Pho or grilled porc plate. And don't forget the Vietnamese coffee. Bonne appétit!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. I've been to Vietnam so obviously I'm a bit of a snob, but this isn't even the best restaurant in the city. Worst of all I had a terrible experience with this old waiter there. He was super rude and condescending. Asked him for suggestions he just shrugged and pouted for some strange reason. My girlfriend, Amanda (hot piece of Ace) called him out on his antics and he smiled. HE KNEW THE WHOLE TIME."}
{"text":"Hands-down the absolute worst service I've had in Montreal. However, the pho was great and that's why you're coming here, isn't it? Might've just been an off day, but I'd advise against ordering fresh pork spring roll; I've had gum less chewy than the rice-paper wrapper they had stretched around it.

Again, solid pho. I got the works, and there was the better part of a cow in my bowl. None of this postage-stamp-sized-slice-of-tripe and half-blob-of-tendon. I don't know if I'd rave about it like all the other reviews, but it's the best of the three bowls (the other two were kind of disappointing) I've had in the city."}
{"text":"I came here a year ago and loved their pho, but I had forgotten the name of the restaurant. I decided to come here based on Tay Ho's high rating on Yelp. I was pleasantly surprised when I waited outside in line to get a seat to find out that this was the amazing place that I had pho a year ago. This place is always packed; this pho cannot compare to the pho in Chinatown. The broth is so delicious and fresh that there is no need to put in sriracha or hoisin (unless you need it) to make the broth taste better. The trip, personally for me, was a bit far, but definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for lunch on a Sunday. It was packed full but we were seated (party of four) i about 5 minutes. Unfortunately I was disappointed by almost everything: the beef pho broth really lacked in flavour, there were barely any noodles and way too much beef. My boyfriend got a chicken and beef pho (with chicken broth) which lacked even more in flavour and tasted as though it had been watered down. The grilled chicken dish was HUGE, so that was cool, but the chicken didn't taste that great. As well, the service wasn't the best, not very attentive and not super chaleureux. I did, however, really like the imperial rolls, those were delicious. Will not come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Très bonne nourriture portions généreuses, pas cher les combos valent vraiment la peine. Le service est rapide et les grillades sont bonnes , mon boeuf par contre était un peu sec ! Je vais y retourner assurément."}
{"text":"SIMPLY AMAZING! Great food, service and staff! Super clean too! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Étant un vietnamien qui est tombé dans la marmite du Pho quand j'étais petit et pour l'avoir goûté durant deux voyages au Vietnam, je crois pouvoir être une bonne référence en Pho et cette place est un des meilleurs à Montréal. Ils font aussi un excellent riz 3 couleurs qui est un plat traditionnel vietnamien. 

Maman qui est bien difficile sur la nourriture aime aussi cette place."}
{"text":"Ça fait quatorze ans que je viens à ce restaurant. Étant une habituée, je réfère toujours cette place à ceux qui me demandent quel restaurant vietnamien sert le meilleur phô. À ma grande déception, ce n'est plus le cas aujourd'hui. J'ai été tout récemment, et je peux dire que ça a beaucoup changé. J'ai appelé 4 fois le serveur pour prendre notre commande, il m'a répété à chaque fois que ça sera pas long. Pour finalement voir qu'il s'est mis a prendre la commande de clients qui sont arrivés vingt minutes après nous. Il s'est même permis de rigoler avec eux et parler de foot. J'ai dut intercepter un autre serveur au passage pour commander. Sans vouloir être raciste, si vous êtes des caucasiens, le service sera au top mais étant asiatique, il semble qu'on se fait moins bien servir. Clairement ils sont très mielleux avec les clients blancs. Le serveur a même versé de la soupe sur ma mère. J'ose croire qu'il ne l'a pas fait exprès, mais la moindre des choses aurait été de revenir avec des serviettes pour éponger sa gaffe, simple geste qu'il a omis de faire. Sans compter qu'on nous passait le balais dans les pieds alors que nous avions même pas fini de souper, car ils avaient hâte de fermer. Très mauvais service. Franchement dire je reviendrai plus jamais dans ce restaurant. Ce qui est vraiment dommage car j'aimais bien ce restaurant dans le passé."}
{"text":"Gi gà (chicken salad) and Ph gà (chicken noodle soup) are the \"must try\" items. Hands down! Good service and relatively cleaner than most restaurants as well. I will definitely be back to try different dishes that they offer on our next Montreal trip."}
{"text":"If vietnamese people recommend this place, must be good right? Came here after hearing so many vietnamese friends talk about this place: wasn't disappointed at all. The portions are huge. The grilled chicken was perfectly marinated and was delicious. I couldn't finish the plate. The spring roll was normal and the 3 colors dessert was good, but I've had better. 

The service is very quick and the food is relatively cheap. 

Will I come back? Oh yes I will, especially for that delicious grilled meat."}
{"text":"La soupe est excellente, sinon la meilleure à mon goût, mais c'est vraiment déplaisant que des serveurs m'aient arrêté sur le trottoir le soir quand j'étais seule pour complimenter mon apparence. Ça serait agréable que vous ayez un peu plus de respect pour les clients."}
{"text":"This place gives generous portions and they don't skimp either. The food itself is pretty good, however my bun came on a plate, yes a plate as opposed to the usual big bowl. I think the food is safe enough for people who are afraid of venturing into new cuisines. Service varied by waiter and I also recommend trying those green desserts they sell at the counter."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious pho and cheap! There are 3 sizes you can get; medium for $9, large for $10, and XL for $11. I got the large & my boyfriend got the XL, and we both agreed the portions were big enough. I consider it cheap pho cause in the states it costs about $9 for a bowl but in American dollars, so it is cheaper here. 

4 stars because it was kind of hectic, granted we went during dinner rush on a Friday night. Also, their fried spring rolls (or as they're called on the menu, imperial rolls) were not that good compared to what I'm used to. Still good overall and worth a shot."}
{"text":"Very large portions, extremely reasonable prices. All is clean and fresh. Staff is kind of robotic but efficient. Interact accepted. Be warned: they close damn early at 9pm. Sharp!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day, a week after coming back to Montreal from Vietnam. With all the Vietnamese restaurants I've tried in Montreal, a majority of them usually suck in comparison to Vietnam, and this sucks just as much too. But, it triumphs almost all of the Vietnamese pho shops in Montreal actually, which is why I'm giving it a 4 out of 5. If I were to put this in Vietnam, It would have been a 3, a me're okay, maybe even two or 1. Yet, my quest to find the best Pho in town still goes on, I hope the quest will be accomplished before I depart from this city again. 

I know you may be thinking, what does this guy know about Vietnamese food. Believe or not, despite my very English name, I am half Vietnamese, who has spent one-third of his life enjoying the beautiful sights, smells, and flavours of Vietnam. Even the women.  That's more than a lot of Vietnamese people from Montreal, actually, and I'm only 20. I take great pride in my country, and i have to find something that does justice to my home cuisine."}
{"text":"- Bouillon légèrement trop salé 
- trop peu de viande dans la 
+ bon goût de manière générale"}
{"text":"I regularly come here for two main dishes: Their Pho Dac Biet (Special Pho) and their pork vermicelli bowl. What's special about their Pho is that it's pretty legit, broth is tasty and doesn't have too much msg, and the Dac Biet style actually comes with trip, tendon, and meat balls (legit). What I like about their pork vermicelli bowl is that it comes with a generous portion of tasty pork and a variety of Vietnamese herbs and pickles. The plate of red chillies at every table is a nice touch, but be careful eating these if you're unfamiliar (dang spicy!). Weekend diners beware, long lineups are not uncommon here on Saturdays and Sundays."}
{"text":"I love Tay Ho! This is by far the best place or the only place in montreal that offers Pho Ga, Long ga. No wonder they are always busy everyday! Their service is pretty fast too! The good side is you get to order by yourself. They give you the menu and a piece of paper where you can select what you want. 

Try their pho ga long ga, goi ga! Everything on the menu is delicious. This place never disappoints! Their bubble tea & iced coffee are awesome! 

If you're in the neighbourhood and craving for some pho, tay ho is the place to be! Don't forget, they are closed on tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Enjoying the first nice weather of the year, we decided to take a walk to this place. A lot of good options to choose from. Since the weather was already pretty warm (compared to the recent winter ) I decided not to go with the pho even though it looked really good. Instead I went for the daily special. I took the grilled chicken one.
It comes with a soup. The soup is good but the issue is that the service is too fast that before the soup is done the main meal is already there.
The food is really good and the service is quick making it perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"I took the pho gà tai and it was good. Very flavourful broth yet, very simple and clear.

It's not the best pho I had. However, the location and the cleanliness of the place truly make up for it.

I would say, it's the pho place I would take somebody who is unsure about Asian food. It's delicious, clean and simple enough to make anyone a fan.

The terrace is really great."}
{"text":"My favorite pho spot in town. As a California native my standard is pretty high but since NYC doesn't have pho that hits the right spot. I get my dose at Pho Tay Ho whenever I come up. I do wish that they'd lay off or go lighter on the MSG though, you find yourself needing lots of water after."}
{"text":"Excellent resto vietnamien, large choix de plats, bons, beaux et pas chers!
Non loin du métro Beaubien, facilement accessible
Service très agréable, souriant et drôle
N'hésitez pas à demander de l'eau ''normale'' si vous n'êtes pas fan de l'eau chaude/thé
J'ai pris la soupe Pho aux crevettes, taille M, vraiment bonne et copieuse!
A essayer sans plus tarder!! :)"}
{"text":"Great place. Great staff. Great food. Lots of veggies in the soup. The food is fresh and high quality. Highly recommended. This place is busy for a reason. If you're looking for great Vietnamese food, look Pho further. I mean no further. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing place. I come to Pho Tay Ho every weekend for \"brunch\". In my opinion, this is the best pho place in Montreal. It is often busy but the service is great and the food comes out quickly as well.

Every week, I order their special pho. Recently, they decided that they will no longer include tendons/tripes in their special pho which was a bit of a let down (hence the 4-star). Also they decided to exclude one of my favourite old items - the sour pork spring roll - since it wasn't a popular menu item. I have been having their fresh spring roll with shrimp and chicken instead which is also fantastic. 

Regardless of their recent menu changes, the food here keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Whoa. This place is just...whoa. Firstly, the tables are really nice. They look like they are made of marble (Are they? I didn't bother checking. Someone find out for me please) and there is a terrace in the front AND at the back. What?? This is a Vietnamese restaurant? Usually the atmosphere is more low key, nothing extraordinary, and very simple. 

The service is good and one thing I should mention is the portion size of the food is quite unbelievably large for a Vietnamese place, especially the bun cha gio. My friend goes there often and she told me the portion sizes here are large, and boy she was not lying. The salad was good a chunk of the plate, the imperial rolls and vermicelli took up half of the plate and so on. I ordered a modest medium pho ga,..they gave me so much meat...I was very happy. 

The highlight of this restaurant, is that they have bo tai chanh which is Vietnamese beef carpaccio. This is rare because most Vietnamese restaurants do not offer this dish. Portion size, again, quite large and came with many shrimp chips and underneath big pieces of lettuce.

This place is really quite something, maybe I'm overhyping it but anyways,  eat there. The end."}
{"text":"Wow... We've had alot of Pho in Toronto and my favourite is brisket because I love the softness and flavour of the marbling.  I ordered the flank here because as there was no brisket on the menu but I was not disappointed.  The flank was cut thick (unusual compared to Toronto)... But it was so soft and some fat was left on fir flavour.  It may have been the best Pho I have ever had..."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pho in the city. If I am ever in the mood to dine out, eat healthy, and not in the mood to shell out big bucks, this is the spot. 

Good : I always order the grilled shrimp, beef and chicken combo. It's the most flavorful dish and you get a large portion size for $15. Another recommendation would be their raw beef salad, it's a great appetizer to share or just as a main on it's own (it's REALLY filling). 

Bad : Sometimes there can be a bit of a wait, especially during peak hours, but it's usually no more than 15 mins. 

Bottom Line : A must try, the restaurant is clean, well lit, and totally worth your money. No one has ever left here disappointed."}
{"text":"Great dinning experience. 
I went with a friend who eats here a lot and served as my 'menu guide'. He talked me into sharing a first course dish of raw beef with lemon, onions and peanuts that was served with a fish sauce on the side. Fan-frigging-tastic! scooping it with shrimp crispies kinda reminded me of really fresh mexican nachos (with an Asian twist to it). It was a big dish, and we didn't even finish it before our mains arrived.  By my friend recommendation I took the L size soup.  It turned out to be way too much, together with the first course... but I  loved it. I got the beef pho with everything (raw beef, flank beef, beef balls with a weird condensed texture, some sort of intestines that were too chowie for by taste). Of course there were noodles and green onions in the broth (which was good), as well as extra sprouts and holly basil on the side. Very satisfying dish. I'm glad I had it and that I got to try different types of beef additions to my soup - to find out what I like a lot and what's not really for me. 
My friend had a good beef, noodles, and veggies dish which was also a success. 
I loved this place!
It's by far the best Vietnamese restaurant place I have been to."}
{"text":"Ma visite de Pho Tay Ho fut brève... j'avais envie d'une pho rapidement entre deux autobus. Ici, l'endroit est tout en longueur avec une verrière à l'arrière (probablement intéressant l'été).

J'ai pris le spécial du midi avec un bol de pho tai (au boeuf) et des rouleaux  impériaux. J'ai trouvé la qualté du boeuf plutôt moyen et je n'aime pas qu'on me serve les nems sans une feuille de laitue digne de ce nom pour l'envelopper.

Le service était expéditif et les prix correspondent au type d'établissement. Je vois d'autres critiques qui insistent que la spécialité est le poulet ici... c'est peut-être mieux que le boeuf mais cela n'améliorera pas la situation avec les nems.

Un endroit correct si vous êtes dans les parages, mais il y a de bien meilleurs endroits à trois coins de rues, près de Jean-Talon et St-Denis."}
{"text":"Had the pho tai (rare flank steak).  The medium portion was enough for a meal.  The broth was tasty but definitely not the best pho broth I have had.  It was heavy on the lemon grass flavor and not as meaty/umami as I like it.  The meat was shaved thin and rare.  The noodles were much thicker (and closer to spaghetti) than any other Pho I've had.  The Vietnamese coffee was good, but got cold quickly since they pour and strain it table side.  Not the best pho place I have been but I have had worse....although I've never had \"bad\" pho...."}
{"text":"Wow, this is probably the best Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to. Went there craving some pho but was blown away by everything. We started with the beef salad, which was DELICIOUS - fresh meat, and the lime squeezed on was great. The onions and peanuts really highlighted the taste. 

The pho was also really great - awesome meat quality and broth. The bf ordered the grilled shrimp, pork and imperial rolls over vermicelli and LOVED it - he went in not even being super hungry but basically finished eating the entire thing. Efficient ordering system (on a sheet of paper), amazing food."}
{"text":"Totally loved this place.  The phos were extremely good -- the noodles were not overcooked (as in most other places), really \"al dente.\"   And it's not expensive either, in the lower $$.   It cost $57 for 5 people, including tip.
Does NOT accept credit cards though -- be warned."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Had to come back for the second time during our short trip from Vancouver. We had pho and vermicelli. Broth is beefy and flavourful. Noodles have the perfect texture. Flank is fatty and delicious. All the meats are seasoned and cooked just right. Plus, they are generous with all the herbs and vegetables. Maybe we will come back for the third time before we leave Montreal!"}
{"text":"Quite possible the best pho I've ever had..  I got pho with rare beef, well done flank, and soft tendon.  The broth was amazingly flavorful.  Bowls come medium, large, and extra large; be warned that the XL is freaking enormous.  I had the large for lunch (along with a very tasty spring roll) and it was more than enough for my big appetite"}
{"text":"As my partner is Vietnamese I like to think my standards in terms of a tasty pho bowl extends a little further than the average white lady, and I also like to think Pho Tay Ho does theirs pretty damn well. 

Their broth is fragrant -- it is not watery or overly salty.  Delicate bits of fat sit on the surface of their soup, decorated with fresh herbs and a decent helping of round eye.   Their noodles are neither overcooked or undercooked.  Basil, lime, and bean sprout sit on a separate plate in generous portions and are very fresh.  I haven't encountered a dried out lime here yet, which is one of my pho grudges. 

Seating is abundant -- there is atrium seating as well as patio seating in both the front and the back for sunnier days and their service is wonderful.  Come, eat here.   This is a good bowl of soup.  I often come here when it is swelteringly hot outside and that's only because it's too hard to say no."}
{"text":"This is officially the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant I've ever tried in North America (including the ones I've tried in San Jose, Boston, New York, etc). The Pho I got is very flavorful and Northern-style (which I loveeee and have been looking for a long time). The cafe sua da is beyond amazing.I was very tired when I came and the food LITERALLY came after 2 minutes. So worth walking for 40 minutes to get here. Loveeee."}
{"text":"I've only known about this restaurant through a good friend of mine.  She highly recommended this place.  She definitely knows her Vietnamese food.  The food is fresh, good and authentic.  The ambiance is casual and relaxed.  Their chicken pho is a must-try.  I haven't tried the beef pho.  Will definitely go back there again.  It's not cheap-cheap but the prices are fair considering the generous portions."}
{"text":"Tout simplement pas bon! 

Pho Ga: 2/5 goûte trop la coriandre, l'anis et pas assez salé...

Bun thit nuong: sauce de poisson fade...trop de nouilles...porc avec pleins de gras...

Com ga nuong: salade iceberg et fève germé...euhh comprend pas...d'habitude c'est un accompagnement avec les vermicelles ...

Cher, mais un affaire de fou! 
Si vous êtes prêt à payer un soupe 11$ pour un format moyen (et disons nous le...c'est petit plus que moyen)...aller essayer d'autres resto viet sur st-denis pas les meilleurs, mais oh combien mieux que celui-ci! 

P.S. Un pho est une soupe repas (un fast food vietnamien) c'est moins de 10$...ne vous faites pas avoir..."}
{"text":"Cuisine authentique et fraîche! Les portions sont généreuses! Un des meilleurs restos vietnamien de Montréal!"}
{"text":"I think it's safe to say that I've found, in my opinion, the best place for pho in Montréal. It seems to be a general trend with Asian food that the best places are often not in the downtown area, but in the less-populated and not as touristy districts. With Pho Tay Ho, I finally had a bowl that was not only deeply satisfying, but had a broth that was flavorful all on its own without needing additional seasoning.

Even though I went at an earlier time, the restaurant was already packed with an even distribution of Asians and other people, so I decided that it must be worth the ten minute wait. Once I sat down, I was given a check-off menu which made for extremely efficient service by Montréal standards. I ordered the Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk, a shrimp spring roll, and a medium bowl of pho with beef balls, tripe, and raw and cooked slices of beef. Overall, everything arrived fairly quickly, so I was able to dig in - nothing disappointed me. The iced coffee had a perfect balance between the strong brew and the sweetness of the condensed milk, and the spring roll actually had a decent amount of shrimp and, when paired with the accompanying sauce, made everything combine into an interesting salty/slightly-sweet fusion. 

The pho was undoubtedly the star of the meal here, as it should be. The tangy and savory broth, which is crucial to a good pho, was fantastic, as it really made everything better. All of the meats tasted outstanding, and even my usually least-favorite cut, the tripe, was tender and really soaked up all of the delectable broth. I could sink my teeth right into the beef balls, and they do not hold back on the beef flavor here. Also, as a huge fan of the raw beef used in pho, it cooked quite nicely and, once again, took in the flavors of the broth and elevated it to a new level. Of course, the rice noodles had a bounciness to them that made them a delight to chew on, and by the time I was done, I really wished that I had ordered a larger bowl because I didn't want to be done with it.

The next time my friends and I decide to go out for pho, I think I know which new place to bring them to. Pho Tay Ho is as good as it gets and lives up to the hype and so much more."}
{"text":"I'm not the best judge of Viet fare, but I love this place and return whenever I can, always to order the Bun Cha, soup, and/or the beef salad."}
{"text":"really good food with quick service. i highly recommend their pho ga and their bbq pork."}
{"text":"Very Authentic Vietnamese!  This is how Pho should taste like.  Less MSG more Bone Marrow floating in your broth.  If you are deciding between a M/L/X... a medium should do for lunch, a large for dinner, and a X for a big guy like me.  =)

I went with the usual Dac Biet Pho in an XL bowl.  I had trouble finishing it.  There isn't just shreds or cheap thin slices of beef, this is a legitimate proportional bowl of noodles.  X doesn't mean bigger bowl, more soup--- it means more of everything!  and gosh there was at pound of meat in my bowl (ok maybe half, but you get the gist).  It was all fresh quality ingredients and maybe one of the best pho I've had in North America.

The spring rolls were ok.  The meatball was not as dense as I would have liked but the flavors were there.  I guess the Pho is what you need to lean on here.  I love it."}
{"text":"I was out for a lovely drive and was in need for Vietnamese. Checked my Yelp app and noticed this place saved in my Bookmark selection. Walked in and about 30 patrons were inside. I was the only non-Asian in the place. Excellent. I'm at the right place for some quality Vietnamese.

Walking in, the place looks somewhat simplistic with a terrace on both sides available if it weren't fall or winter. The ambiance was nice.

I went with the Tay Ho 'Special BBQ' dish (Bun Cha Tay Ho) and it came back 10 minutes later. It was excellent. The soup was amazing, the meats hit the spot and the side order was mighty tasty. And the price tag was ridiculous for this kind of quality. I immediately felt jealous for people able to walk/order from this place on a daily basis.

On my way out, I took some Vegetarian Pho home for the wife and even with the winter tip home, she has never had Pho this good.

Would come back again... and again."}
{"text":"Of course I had to have my requisite international bowl of Pho. I tried the Pho Dac Biet, with good quality cuts of beef. The broth is reminiscent of Turtle Tower's in SF, light and homey. Noodles are the thick fresh rice noodles.

Thai chilies are on each table, for a much needed kick.

I also tried the Nem Chua Cuon, which is the sour pork spring roll. Very tasty dipped into the nuoc cham."}
{"text":"We looked forward to the authentic experience of this restaurant. We noticed many local Viet's frequented this restaurant.
We ordered both the Chicken pho and Raw beef/tripe pho. The soup base was made with chicken instead of the traditional beef, but I really liked how comparatively refreshing it was. The noodles were thicker then the usual and not as chewy as I would like.
The ice coffee was very traditional, using the Viet drip, then pouring it over ice. Not very fragrant but  strong and tasty coffee.
The four stars is for a unique Viet experience but not especially for the food."}
{"text":"Tres bon! Aucune deception, j'y retourne des que je peux. 

Nourriture: 5 etoiles, grosse portion, pas tres cher, beaucoup de saveur et de choix. 

Service et decors: 5 etoiles, tres propre et beau decors. Terrasse avant et arriere. Service rapide.

Je vous en reparle quand j'y retourne pour essayer autre chose!"}
{"text":"So yeh, this is the first time I go to the Vietnamese restaurant cuz I miss Vietnamese foods so much. I call the combo 1 which includes 2 imperial rolls and a large \"ph\" with white chicken meat. The rolls are quite good and the \"ph\" is unexpected. It is really good, of course not as perfect as in Vietnam but it tastes well. I ate the large size which is enough for me. The restaurant is crowded and we need to line up. So I rate 4 stars cuz the servants are not friendly like I expect."}
{"text":"Came back here a year later and it's just as good. I think the menu has likely changed as there are no more \"special combos\" but it's probably just re-phrased.

It's more expensive than the typical viet place but where else can you get all the herbs and good quality vermicelli from?"}
{"text":"If you're looking for montreals best Vietnamese restaurant, this is it. Excellent food excellent service, and very fast! I always get the vermicelli platter with beef and shrimp"}
{"text":"Really really delicious broth. This pho is phenominal!

Fair warning though, cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Oh man! I reviewed Pho Tay Ho so long ago and have literally eaten here one zillion times since then!! It's so good. The dish I pretty much always get here is number twenty something, it comes with these homemade ground pork rolls and noodles and broth and veggies and it's just an insane mountain of incredibly flavourful delicate wonderful food. I take home the leftovers and eat it for like 3 days, and I cheat on my vegetarian-ness here when I crave it and I ain't even sorry about it. You have to follow your heart, man, you know? 

I find the service here totally great, and very Vietnamese. They aren't all fake smily with you but they are super professional, and will crack you up and slide you a sweet grin if you're paying attention. 

This is one of the best and beloved Vietnamese places in the city so if you come at peak times you'll find a line. I recommend mid-afternoon on a weekday. Relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"Pho Tay Ho has a pretty good reputation among our Vietnamese relatives, so we came in with lofty expectations but ... we left largely disappointed. 

I'll start off with the few things that were good: their bun cha + the fact that things were reasonably priced, especially an XL bowl for $11 

Still, the servers were pretty rude, and we were wholly dissatisfied with the pho. The broth was bland and not an authentic pho broth (that's usually rich in flavor from beef bones). 

Overall, I would not come here again unless it was exclusively for their bun cha."}
{"text":"This pho place was amazing!!! BEST in town! The soup was extremely tasty, I think they also added chicken broth along with beef soup. It was soooo good! 
We also got the beef salad, it was quite special. Kind of like beef tartar but got a Vietnamese spin to it with loads of peanuts and fresh herbs. Great!
They also give you a small bowl along with your soup, it's for you to miss the sauces and dip your pho in there for some added flavour.
It was such a satisfying lunch!"}
{"text":"Quite nice Vietnamese restaurant on St. Denis. Nice ambiance. Good food and jasmine tea. Beautiful presentation. The bun vermicellis were also nice. Their fish sauce was aromatic and delicious."}
{"text":"My favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Montreal. Everything on their menu is delicious. I especially like their raw beef salad. Unlike some other places that use way too much MSG, their broth used for the pho tastes authentic."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 4 1/2.  I've been here twice now and have enjoyed their pho very much. Our cousin ordered a rice combo dish with beef and shrimp and it was gigantic! I think the price is reasonable for what you get. It's a shame the location is a bit out of our way, making it difficult to go more often. 

I have to remember to ask for the lime leaves next time as Khanh L suggested."}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas eu l'occasion de tester le restaurant car j'ai uniquement pris a emporter...Je sais que je passe régulièrement devant et que c'est souvent complet et de bonne heure.

A emporter c'est parfait quand vous prenez une soupe car c'est prêt vraiment vite. Les soupes que j'ai testés sont vraiment bonnes et la quantité plus que raisonnable. Je prends toujours la moyenne et c'est largement suffisant pour une personne qui mange bien (et pour 10$ que demander de plus). Je comprends pourquoi il y a si souvent du monde."}
{"text":"I came on a chilly night to meet up with a girlfriend over for some chicken pho. The chicken broth tastes a little different than the beef broth I am used to having and I had a banana split to end the night. 

The place doesnt get crowded until 7 pm. At this time, the restaurant is packed and it can get a little full. 

Overall, this place is a great place to eat.  The portion is generous and the staffs are helpful. Most of them speak English."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for an excellent Vietnamese lunch!  First we ordered the organs (tendon, heart, liver ...I know some FrancoAnglo people will think gross but asians love it!!) in cilantro/onions.  Then I had a rare beef pho!  Amazing broth and very quick service and quality!  Washed it down with a vietnamese coffee!!  Awesome!  Gotta come here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Most people who like Vietnamese Pho noodles (sometimes referred to as Tonkinese in Montreal) like the Pho Bo noodles, which is Beef (Bo) noodles. 

By far the beef is the most popular, and has a lot of variations. But if you like Chicken noodle soup (who doesn't, especially with a cold?) then Pho Tay Ho is known in Montreal for the best Pho Ga (chicken). 

They don't use free range chicken like Pho Ga An Nam in San Jose, CA, but they make a good Pho Ga."}
{"text":"Tired of the tourist scene, the family and I headed into the more residential portions of Montreal to get some relief from it all.  Luckily my wife found this place on Yelp and we hit the metro.

This place is POPULAR with the locals.  Packed to the brim but lucky enough to grab a seat.  They serve an extensive and authentic Viet menu and boy was it good.  The summer rolls were really fresh and tasty.  Pho was flavorful (came in 3 different sizes), grilled pork chop was massive and decadent, and the grilled pork vermicelli was chock full of fresh veggies and herbs to take the meal to another level.  

Portion sizes are very large here.  Some other Yelpers thought it was a bit pricy but not me.  Well worth it for the quality.  This place is cash only but coming from NYC what else is new for a real Viet restaurant?  Two big thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place is super-hyped as the best pho around. And it is! Ultimately satisfying. I usually get the rare-beef. My vegetarian pal claims the seafood pho is as good as in Thailand."}
{"text":"The pho was good. My only complaint is that they put so much noodles into my bowl that there was barely any soup and the noodles starting sucking up more soup which left even less soup. This ruined my meal as I did not get to enjoy a bowl of pho and was left with a bowl of noodles lol. I won't be returning as I have found better places around the city surprisingly. I eat pho cause I love the broth and want to drink the broth. This place sort of ruined the experience for me. My honest review would be 2.5 stars out of 5. Half because the food was good and lost half because they ruined my meal. But I rounded up and so they get 3 stars."}
{"text":"I read about the good reviews on line and when I entered the place, it was packed with Vietnamese. SCORE. But, having just arrived in Montreal...what a buzzzzzz kill.

I am not usually a person to slam a restaurant unless it's really warrented. This was warrented. Food is more a 3 star, the spring rolls and the fresh rolls were very good. They offer Med-Xlarge pho size. Good flavor, harty and good price.

Now, let's talk about service because that is a huge part of the experience. To be fair, I will admit, my friend is a bit demanding, but whether it's culturally acceptable or not, we tip generously and are not rude about our needs. I also need to understand maybe it's just a Canadian \"thing\" to be not very personable. I don't know, but to me, customer service is customer service! With that being said, our waiter was RUDE and his rude sarcasm was not appreciated and I LOVE sarcasm. He was quick to judge us as Americans. After ordering additional spring rolls, he ignored us and we never received them. He snubbed us the whole time and avoided eye contact. We asked for tea and he said there was none and then brought us a pot. WTF, that was not confusing at all. He could not get us out fast enough. Don't worry dude, we ate fast and left as fast as we could."}
{"text":"Really good, perfect balance quality price. The portions are big and everything is very tasty. I was amazed by the spring rolls, that means something. I found the Pho (soups) to be ok, nothing particularly amazing but still quite satisfying. Do yourself a favor, take a bubble tea, best I've had."}
{"text":"C'est un bon restaurant vietnamien avec de la nourriture quand même authentique. Leur bol signature est surtout la soupe tonkinoise (pho) au poulet je crois, mais ils ont plusieurs options intéressantes. 

Ils se méritent un 5 grâce à mes parents qui aiment bien manger à cette place, and who knows how asian parents are picky when it comes to their food ! 
Ma belle-soeur qui a récemment immigrés du Vietnam trouve ce plat comparable (pho) à celui au Vietnam.

Ils ont plusieurs options, mais je crois vraiment que leur pho est la meilleure option, le tout couronné d'un dessert che-3-mau! Je vais bien sûr siroter mon jus de coconut aussi en attendant le dessert. Le bol Medium (on a le choix en M, L et XL) est amplement assez, mais si vous avez une faim de loup, vous pouvez vous aventurez pour le xe lua aka train !!

Le service est assez rapide. Ne vous surprenez pas s'il y a une file d'attente.

Around 10$ for a good sized bowl of pho !"}
{"text":"Went on Canada day, but the service was HORRIBLE. They were slow to clean tables and seat us, and the servers were also extremely rude. It took forever to find a table, and when we told the waiters that we were ready to order, they just dismissed us and walked away.

The food was also a real let down. I had the Pho Tai, but as a Vietnamese person, this has to be some of the worst Pho I've ever had. The broth was flavorless and full of MSG. They gave very little meat, and didn't even have the little dishes to dip it into hoisin/Sriracha.

Apparently, the Bun Cha Ha Noi was good, but nevertheless, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Adorable, delicious, great value, friendly. Perfect date."}
{"text":"This is our go to local Pho place, but don't let the word \"local\" fool you into thinking it is only good for this area. There a few great things about this place. The staff is fast, friendly and good. The location is packed but well run and cozy (unless you get stuck at the tables near the door and line-up is all around you). The food is very good. The quality is good and the price is very good for the quantity. We regularly go with the whole family because it is affordable and children friendly. We have tried many things on the menu and all are good, but the favorites are the Pho, the bowls of noodles or rice and the meat platters. Check out the pictures. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Base on what other customers ordered while I was there, it seems that Tay Ho is specialized in Pho Ga` (chicken noodle soup) and it was pretty darn good. The broth was flavorful and the chicken meat was pretty good, almost tasted like free range chicken.

The good surprise for me was the Goi Ga` ( chicken salad). Unlike many places that mixed their Goi Ga with too much sugar and cabbage, Tay Ho mixed their Goi Ga just like the way people in VietNam normally do. A little onion, a little salt and peper, little sugar, a little lemon juice, peanut, and a decent amount of rau ram (which has a lemon and coriander-cilantro aroma). Their Goi Ga is something you gotta try if you visit this restaurant.

Highly recommend this place for Pho Ga and Goi Ga.

On the side note, this place does not have parking at all and it's a pain to find parking on the street."}
{"text":"This is a popular place in Rosemont. It's always full of people, and most of them are Vietnamese.

I'm not a huge pho fan, so I didn't have it here. All the stuff I did have (noodles, rolls, etc) were good, made fresh, and served quickly.

The venue itself is nothing special, but definitely not bad either. I would probably just get takeaway next time."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible services. I'm not from Canada so I had a couple of questions regarding the menu and if they have certain items. The man I spoke to was very rude giving me one word answers and kept on trying to walk away from me as I was still asking questions. Another man walked by us and my fiancé asked if we could order and he said \"yeah\" while still continuing to walk away. Rude. What kind of service is this?!  If we needed to fill out the order form ourselves just tell us don't just let us sit there not knowing what to do. By the way the order form is in Vietnamese."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Pho houses I've been to in Montreal.   Like my fellow yelpers said, the soup broth is full of flavor and the service is prompt and fast.    I've had the Bun which is like pho (soup) but without the broth inside.  You get fish sauce on the side to pour it in your bowl.   What more can I ask for?!  Be prepared to wait Sat and Sun (lunch) unless you go a bit early.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"decent food... fast delivery to your table.. if you like asian - go - u will enjoy it.."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant by far.  The food was delicious.  I scanned reviews and found Jessica's review and ordered down her list for a perfect meal!!!
The chicken soup with gizzards & liver, the raw beef salad and grilled need over noodles.   Awesome!!!
They take cash or debit only!"}
{"text":"I am a big lover of pho.  I have enjoyed it from Hanoi to Little Saigon in CA but only a few times in Canada.  Having said that, I thought this was a good version with nice noodles that aren't all lumped together, a good flavor developed broth with plenty of meat.  Also, I got the ex-large size and I couldn't finish it as it was really large.  This was the second largest bowl that I have ever gotten anywhere."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Pho Tay Ho. We were impressed that the waitstaff spoke both English and French.

There is a large dining area and a patio for al fresco dining.

We ordered two bowl of pho and one vermicelli dish. The pho was tasty, filled with plenty of beef and noodles and came with a healthy bunch of basil and plenty of bean sprouts.

The vermicelli was served on a huge platter with lots of grilled pork, 2 skewers of grilled shrimp and 2 spring rolls. There was soooo much fresh basil, mint, lettuce and bean sprouts on the side. Although we thought $15 seemed a lot for a vermicelli dish, they certainly didn't skimp on anything so we could see why it cost more than usual.

We also had an iced coffee with condensed milk. It tasted good, but there was very little condensed milk so it was quite strong and not really sweet enough (and we don't like it too sweet). 

Our son ordered a fresh lime juice with sugar and soda but they were out of soda, so they gave him 7up instead. The problem was that they still added the sugar to the lime juice, so the whole thing was way too sweet.

All in all, the meal was pretty good and we'd probably return."}
{"text":"I stopped in here during a Montreal visit, aside from the Pho being more expensive than what I'm used to, not a bad restaurant at all.

Biggest complaint would be smaller portions for higher prices when compared to Toronto's Pho places.

The good? Delicious broth, really tasty meat, the appetizers were great."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Vietnamese food in Montreal. After spending time in Vietnam it's been challenging to find real tasty Vietnamese food in North America, but this one is great. It is authentic, everything is fresh and the food is delicious.  service is very fast and the waiters are nice. We had rolls for appetizer, and pho soup after (one had the grilled beef with noodles which he loved) that were above in beyond expectations.
The downside is that they close very early (9pm) and there's always a waiting line, so go early if you don't want to be rushed out !"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for over 14 years now and food has always been amazing, the best vietnamese restaurant in town for me. But unfortunately every time I've gone in the past year, the service has been terrible, and continually gets worse. Last time we went, it took over 20 min for a waiter to take our order. We asked him 3 times before he finally came to take our order. Although he did help the people near us. It was hard not to think they gave preference to people they assumed were \"big tippers\" based off race... Well, too bad for him. He missed out on a good tip, and after such continually bad service in the recent year, I don't think I'll be returning here often like I used to do."}
{"text":"Restaurant typiquement vietnamien: on aime! L'endroit est toujours plein, à chaque fois que j'y suis allée j'ai dû faire la file durant quelques minutes pour avoir une place. On y retourne quand même puisque c'est un des rares endroits qui offre la nourriture traditionnelle (depuis 22 ans cette année!!). Tout est bon, mais j'ai un penchant pour les soupes. Par exemple, la soupe tonkinoise aux légumes sautés et crevettes est remplie de beaux légumes frais, de quelques grosses crevettes et le bouillon est à personnaliser selon notre envie (plusieurs accompagnements sont fournis à la table). Le rouleau de printemps au poulet avec sa sauce aux arachides est aussi très bon et léger. Niveau prix, c'est très abordable. Ma soupe m'a coûté 8$ et le rouleau de printemps 3$. L'endroit est plutôt bruyant et achalandé alors on n'y va pas pour un souper romantique, mais plutôt pour une bouffe d'après cinema en gang, par exemple. À essayer pour découvrir de nouvelles saveurs!"}
{"text":"I rate Vietnamese restaurants mainly based on the pho.  The pho here is delicious except that the so-called \"rare beef\" isn't rare at all."}
{"text":"Best pho ga I've ever had! When I come to this place I always order the pho ga long ga which is chicken pho with chicken innards. It might sound repulsive at first but please do give it a try because you might end up ordering it every time like me. What I absolutely love about the pho here is that they have small pieces of lemongrass which is a pleasant surprise every time you happen to bite into it. Furthermore, the pho noodles are so fresh and they feel like silk when you slurp your soup.

If you like to sunbath a little I'd recommend getting a table towards the back of the restaurant as there are huge windows there.

I almost forgot to mention that although the service is not the best, the orders come out quicker than a blink of an eye. Once an order of pho is placed, you get your bowl within 5 minutes. That's like fast food level of speed!"}
{"text":"Avec les bons commentaires, je m'attendais à une soupe exceptionnelle! Mais non, quoique mangeable, le bouillon manquait clairement de gout, de profondeur. Un bouillon de poulet maison avec trop de coriandre... triste. Loin d'être un des restaurant vietnamien de la ville."}
{"text":"Pho Tay Ho is not a bad option if you want to take a break of these rich, heavy food you might be eating during your visit to Montreal. A bowl of comforting Pho is the best remedies for hangover after bar hopping.

Bo Thai Chanh ($10) Rare Beef Salad was a huge serving which I enjoyed. House Special Pho ($10) was decent.

So nothing really stand out for a special visit but worth coming if you are in the neighbourhood and craving some solid Vietnamese food!

Pho Tay Ho can be super busy even on a week nights. But at least on a warm summer evening, the back patio is open for business."}
{"text":"Pho (boeuf saignant mon préféré!) et bo bun délicieux ! Copieux et prix plus que raisonnable. J'adore cet endroit. Seul bemol, ça ferme un peu tôt (9pm) pour moi."}
{"text":"great chicken broth very different from all the other pho i had which is usually a beef broth."}
{"text":"Cozy. Authentic. Lots of herbs.  I mean lots!
My go to place for Vietnamese food in Montreal.
Has items only real Vietnamese would order.
Although tasty, skip the items you are already familliar with and order everything else.  It's truly an authentic experience."}
{"text":"Food is really good here. only issue I have is that the price is high for Vietnamese food. And the service is just not very good. Rude and loud. But if you want authentic and good food, this is it."}
{"text":"Best pho in Montreal outside of china town, served with a HUGE portion of herbs.  I've tried nearly everything here, definitely love it all!"}
{"text":"We must be staying in a great neighborhood because everything we try is delicious.  The Pho Ga with vegetables is fresh, flavorful, and warm. The spring rolls were a perfect compliment to the Pho.  The service is very friendly and really fast."}
{"text":"Best authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Montreal!!! ordered Pho ga,  com suon nuong, bo tai chanh, bun cha ca, pho dac biet.....***HUGE PORTTION*** everything is on point!!! service is super fast, friendly and down to earth.....love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Kind of conflicted. The pho was okay. The broth tasted weird to me and their noodle choice was not what I was expecting. The meat is okay, the service is fine, and the place is clean enough. The prices are also good. I did see something like dirt still on the basil leaves so that was a downer. 

But nothing in particular stood out about this place. It's really just okay."}
{"text":"I am pretty sure that this restaurant has been open for YEARS! But my first encounter was in 2011. Where have I been??? This is the only place that I know of that has pho with unlaid eggs. The broth is clear and delicious! The plates are amazing! Portions are huge! Service is good! I usually come here after a night of partying hard with my friends. Nothing better then a pho to cure that hang over! Or I would stop by and order to go if I am in that area even if I am not hungry. It is that good people! I mean, i love me a good pho... This is one of the best!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best pho I've had in a long time. The broth tastes very authentic and the banh pho (pho noodles) are the wide type which is uncommon in most places. Being a Vietnamese person I am very picky regarding pho and I will have to say this place gets two thumbs up. Very clean inside and fast service. The ordering process is a little odd but easy. You get a menu and also a sheet to order on. Write the quantity down and someone will pick it up and put in the order. We also got the bo thai Chanh (beef salad - raw) and it is phenomenal. Lots of fresh limes, peanuts and onions. So fresh. If we find ourself in Montreal again we will make a trip here."}
{"text":"Great food, super fresh and brought out very fast even though the place was pretty filled.  Had the Bun Bo as the main meal and then fried ice cream for dessert and it was a great way to wrap up a delicious meal. Sooo much food for a great price ($29 total for 2 people and dessert)"}
