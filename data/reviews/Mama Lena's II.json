{"text":"Premium describes the food provided by mama Lena's. We have ordered delivery from here a few times and each time has been exceptional. In our neighborhood, sheraden, there aren't many delivery options that have high quality foods.   Their white pizza is perfect. You can tell that the chefs put a lot of love into the food they make.   It's not cheap by any means but if you've already committed to ordering delivery pizza, spend a few extra bucks. It will be worth it."}
{"text":"Mama Lena's unique and delicious Pizza selections pulled me in! Then I tried the Robbi Wings with dust and I got hooked! They have authentic Italian dishes that many come from all over for. I love the family friendly atmosphere and the customer service is unmatchable!! Go check them out...you will be a return customer!"}
{"text":"My brother and I have band rehearsal several blocks from here once a week, we needed a decent place to have dinner on our way. For the past year and a half we have been having dinner at Mama Lena's II every week. They a have a quiet dining room in the back, very comfortable.  We have worked our way through the menu a few times and have never had a meal that was less than great. It is always clean, the owners treat us like family. We started with Pizza, worked our way though their dinner, sandwiches and wings.   When owners of a business take pride in what they do, it shows. Mama Lena's II is a gem in the heart of McKees Rocks business district. I recommend that you stop in the next time you are in \"The Rocks\"!"}
{"text":"the food was great,but they overcharge on delivery.they say it is free delivery,but constantly add 2.00-3.00$.so enjoy the food,but check your receipt."}
{"text":"First time trying Mama Lenas \"II\"  I was a fan of the original.   Steeler Sunday so craving wings big time.  I had a tough time finding a menu online - that listed their wing flavors.  I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the flavored over the phone when I called to place the order.  There were many selections.    I chose Very Hot and Wet Cajun.  The Cajun were very good and I am indeed impressed.   The Very hot weren't that hot.   They seemed like just hot wings with red pepper flakes on them.. but they were tasty.    I ordered a side of fries.  I don't expect fresh cut fries but it seems like every pizza/hoagie establishment in the area has the exact same fries.  They are slightly coated with like a beer batter or something.  I am always looking for the place that has great fresh fries.   These were ok but just the same as any other place - meh.  Hooray for the Cajun wings. I look forward to going back and trying something else.   Thank you Mama Lena's II."}
{"text":"I love it here. The people who work here are always so nice to me and the food and service can't be beat.  Their prices are good and the quality of their food is perfect.  I go at least twice a week."}
{"text":"Ordered from here once on a Friday Night, the Food was good but being the beginning of the weekend it was busy.   I placed my order around 5 and due to the high volume of orders our food didn't show u somewhere between 45 minutes to an hour later.  Tip for the day: place your order  early enough to get it at reasonable time, around or during the weekend"}
{"text":"I was invited by some friends to meet here for supper before attending a geocaching event. My friends ate here last year and was so impress that they decided to eat here this year and invite me to join them. I was not disappointed.. I was really not prepared for this as when they gave me the menu. The menu is huge!!  But I decided on the Italian hoagie while my son ordered the lasanga. My hoagie was good and my son's lasanga looked really good.. My friends ordered a pizza and a spinach feta roll which was huge. I will return here when I am back in town and I will try some other items on their menu."}
{"text":"When a friend told me about a great Italian place in McKees Rocks that offered homemade pasta, I was skeptical.  I was even more skeptical when I parked in front of the place and went in because from the outside and first impressions, it's a pizza place.  But if you walk beyond the counter you'll find a cozy and welcoming dining room.    The service is top notch.  My friend ordered the lasagna and I went with the chicken parmesan with pasta.  My glass was never empty and neither was my belly.  We were served side salads and several slices of bread (I can only assume from nearby Mancini's) each before our meals.  The entree salads must be enormous if what we got was the \"side\" salad.  Our food came not too long after.  My friend's lasagna was beautiful and delicious.  My chicken parm was enough food for three people and fed me for several days even after I enjoyed some there.  We even met Mama Lena herself who graciously take a picture with us.  We could not praise her and the food enough.  And the cost?  $13 for each meal was a bargain considering it was enough food for 2 days.   Let this be a lesson...if you're rolling down Broadway in the Rocks, don't let Mama Lena's fool you.  It's more than just a pizza place."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.  The sauce is incredible.  Everything we have gotten here is best in class.  Garlic Knots.  Pizza. Jalape√±o poppers. Good bye to milanos and this is trouble for Julianos."}
{"text":"I made a mistake on an online order. They corrected MY mistake for free!  Their pizza is fantastic and their service is better!  It was my error and they corrected it no problem.and no cost to me!! I will always give them my business!! Thank you Mama Lena 2's!!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was as expected from a pizza shop what do you want how much and how long. Delivery was reasonable for dinner time. First off when the pizza gets to your door you can smell it and it smells good. It has a sweet taste to it, maybe the sauce? Either way it's excellent. The buffalo wings are good. They come covered in sauce just the way we like them. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places to get pizza in the area. My grandparents recommended it- super authentic Italian style pizza and ingredients! The sauces (white and red) are fantastic. We order mama Lena's now all of the time good customer service and great food. Oh! Hot garlic wings aren't super spicy get the Cajun if you want a good kick (:"}
{"text":"OK five stars for a neighborhood restaurant? Well, yes! We were going to the local funeral home and wanted to get a quick bite. I ordered the Pasta Vasoul soup. This was the best I've ever had in the city! We also ordered the Pepperoni Rolls which was a huge order and delicious. Had to take most of it home. Can't wait to have the soup again, and try the pizza."}
{"text":"Every time I eat at this place I like it more. Their stromboli is one of the best I've ever eaten, and they had a pizza with rigatoni on it. It's weird, the staff is friendly, the food rules. I'm very excited to be living ten minutes away!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to go when visiting my friend who lives nearby. The pizza is SO good, and is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Again.  GREAT food.  Fast delivery.  Fantastic wings.  Good onion rings and OUT STANDING hoagies. Thanks."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the connivence of ordering online, I would probably never order from here. Food is ALWAYS mediocre at best and delivery takes forever. Today I ordered a gyro, salad and a Dr Pepper. They didn't put the lids on the dressing tight enough so dressing got everywhere. Lovely. My gyro was lukewarm (ew, but at least they remember the tazikki sauce this time) and my Dr Pepper was a coke (no big deal, just the icing on the cake)"}
{"text":"I am really pi$$@d off right now which is either the best time or the worst time to write a review. So I ordered my lunch from this place and I am just going to warn anyone who has any specific requests to not expect them when you order from a local pizza joint. Anyway I called and ordered gnocchi on the menu it says they have marinara sauce but on the phone they said no that they didn't. I asked them if they have any sauce without meat and they said yes pizza sauce. I said I am vegan I do not eat meat please make sure there's no meat or cheese on my meal. They said there will not be. So to my surprise when my order arrived. It was covered in meat sauce with a big meat ball and covered with cheese. Now they will not return and pick up the delivery although it was their fault it was wrong. So I just paid for something that I cannot eat. The salad was covered in cheese as well. I do not understand how their are still people in this world who do not get it that their are people who do not eat the flesh of living beings. Or the secretions of one either. I will not be ordering from here again in the future!!"}
