{"text":"First time here and won't be the last. The Ceviche de Vivaneau is excellent! Service is great and atmosphere great for multiple friend dinner or just a date night. Salmon tartare was good, not the best but definitely solid. Good wine list and ex Ellen cocktails. Crepes Suzette to die for!"}
{"text":"Soirée mémorable, repas, services, ambiance tout était parfait. J'ai mangé des moules en entrée, une salade au bleu(je ne me souviens plus de son appellation) des pâtes au crevettes et lardons à la crème, à se rouler par terre. J'y retourne c'est certain, et j'ai déjà référé à plusieurs de mes amis."}
{"text":"A classic French bistro just east of the block with Foxy, Grinder etc. The decor is lovely. The food was good. I ordered the foie gras & salmon tartare. Both were good. My husband wasn't as thrilled with his burger (it had salami on it - odd topping) but enjoyed his mussels. The drinks were very good. There  was nothing wrong with the restaurant but nothing stood out to us either; so not sure if we'll be rushing back. A solid 7/10"}
{"text":"I found the decor and ambience to be quite pleasant. The virtual art across behind the car streaming snippets of old French films!   The presentation of the food was original and artistic ( we had the Tour de France cheese platter, oysters & mussels). Drinks were average - I have had way better old fashioneds for a whiskey lover. Although the bubbly was great by the glass.  This place was over-priced but I am glad I checked it out!"}
{"text":"This place had literally just opened a few days ago when we went to try it out.  We were a group of seven going to celebrate a friend's birthday.  For a place that had just opened, it had a good crowd for a Saturday night, about 2/3 full.  Decor is classic Paris bistro meets hipster, and somehow that all works just fine.  Lots of old vintage French film and music stars on the walls in distressed finishes, and lots of vintatge French music interspersed with more modern stuff like Coeur de Pirate playing as well.  Overall it had a really fun vibe.  Service was a little uneven, understandable under the circumstances, but it was always pleasant and attentive.  Our waitress in particular was very sweet and it seemed REALLY important to her that we liked our food.  Speaking of the food... menu is French bistro classics with modern touches.  I had a pretty decent bowl of mussels to start, broth was good but not outstanding, and portion was nicely sized for an appetizer.  My friend had the foie gras, which was excellent, and was a very generous portion as well.  I had the salmon tartare for my main, which was very good, with a side of a small salad and some fries which were very tasty but just a touch on the greasy side for my liking.   They have a short but decent wine list, although they were out of several bottles the night we were there, again probably reflecting early opening hiccups.  We did settle on a very nice Burgundy which worked just fine.  I didn't have dessert, but my friend had the chocolate cake and though it quite good.  A fun new addition to the hot restaurant strip on Notre Dame between Atwater and Peel.  I'd say this place is off to a great start, a solid four stars with potential for five.  Will definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the patio with my friends we only order drinks and a charcuterie platter.  Service was great !"}
{"text":"Incredible food!  The Gnocchi were little pillows of heaven in a tasty butter sauce. Accompanying shrimp were a bit tough but the Gnocchi made up for it ten-fold.   Onglet de boeuf was amazing as well. Beautifully seasoned, perfectly cooked!  Cocktails were well made.  The ambience is great and was accentuated by the wait staff. They were loving life and it is contagious."}
{"text":"Situated on Notre-Dame street, in Griffintown, this little French restaurant has its charms.   The decor is very rustic and classy. Anyway, to food: First, I had their fried duck drumstick as an entree. It was pretty good to my surprise because at first it looked dry but it wasn't at all. Then, I had their cod as the main dish. The fish is just like butter; it melts in your mouth. Combine with the sauce, I think it was a green pea paste, it's a flavour full dish.   Nothing was heavy, the food is pleasantly fulfilling. The waiter was very nice to us. Good knowledge on the drinks and was friendly enough to recommend us different cocktails to different tastes. Overall a great dining experience.  Fun fact: Tuesday oysters are a dollar each!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with a group of friends on a Sunday night. We all really liked the atmosphere, but most of all the food is really amazing. The quality of dishes you get for the prices is pretty incredible in Montreal. The waiters were very polite and nice, however the service was quite slow, but the wait is well worth it. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Expect a classic french menu in a beautiful decorated space, that screams french bistro in the late 60s, at this #griffintown restaurant.   The dishes we sampled including some lucky lime oysters, the salmon tartare, and the shrimp cocktail were fantastic! We also had the charcuterie and raclette dishes; both were underwhelming and can use some work on the presentation.   And what is a french bistro without great French wine! The recommended Sancerre was spot on.  The prices were descent for the location and the service was very warm, prompt and knowledgeable.   Overall, I loved the feel and look of this venue, and enjoyed most of the dishes we sampled. The wine was fantastic, the service was great so I'd totally go back, hopefully before the terrace up front disappears!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I see it as a solid option for lunch during the week. With the nice decor and chic vibe, im sure it'd be a good option for a night out as well. I enjoyed the salmon tartare and the chicken. I've also tried the half charcuterie plate and the duck magret, which were ok."}
{"text":"Probably the worst dining experience in all my years visiting Montreal. They're out of veal entree then ran out of cassoulet as a second choice. Frisée salads arrived without blue cheese as described on menu. It took e hour and forty minutes to be served Steak arrived cold.   Kitchen out of control. Severs confused. Owner clueless. Just a big waste of a night. Too many other good choices so do yourselves a favor and avoided this disaster."}
{"text":"Je suis définitivement charmée par l'endroit!!! Service attentionné par Patrick notre serveur, qui prend le temps de m'assigner une table au chaud comme je suis grippée, qui rigole avec nous, nous propose les meilleurs choix en matière de vins et de plats. Il a tenté toute la tablée avec le plat de crevettes et gnocchi que mes amis ont tous adoré. Personnellement, j'étais en mode viande cette soirée la et j'ai été ravie par moi choix d'onglet de buf, tendre en bouche, savoureux et cuit comme je le souhaitais. L'endroit est magnifique, beau à voir, l'ambiance y est festive et la musique pas trop assourdissante. J'ai été conquise par l'établissement. La carte de dessert un peu trop limité à mon goût, je n'ai rien trouvé qui m'a tenté moi qui ai la dent sucrée...."}
{"text":"The decor of this French bistro is so cute! I like that there's a terrace out front. The service is good. It's only been open for a couple of months and I was surprised at how busy it was when I showed up. I will definitely be back. It's close-by and the food and drinks are good. Plus $1 oysters ?! Yes please!!  They were quite big too! I don't know if they have $1 oysters every day though. The drinks we had were so tasty and so pretty! The flowers make it look like art. I started wit the French 75 (gin, simple syrup, bubbly and lemon) and my friend had the red sangria. The sangria was light and fruity and so pretty. I then had the aperol spritz followed by a bloody Caesar. I admit the latter wasn't so great. I think the bartender put too much worcestershire sauce in mine. Be sure to stick to the cocktails on the menu! I also had the salmon tartare entree and my friend and I shared the truffle fries. The tartare was good, the fries were ok. Nothing special. I wish I had ordered the tartare as a main because the main comes with salad and fries and is 8oz instead of 4 oz."}
