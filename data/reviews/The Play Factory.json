{"text":"This place is totally overrated and not at all as big as their website photos show.  If I had paid more than the 4.50 for toddler Tuesday, I would have complained to the management. Majority of kids there were unsupervised--mothers, nannies on their cell phones or tablets not paying attention to their unruly children/charges. Get rid of the TV and video games. Make the physical activity area bigger. Owner putting on the rock climbing harnesses, very sarcastic. 3-year olds do not understand sarcasm."}
{"text":"With three small children it's sometimes hard to find activities that they can all enjoy at the same time that don't break the bank. We stubled on Play Factory a few months ago when it first opened at Desert Ridge and I am thrilled that they are in the neighborhood. It's clean, air conditioned, and the layout is such that you can watch multpple children at the same time. My twins LOVE the indoor rock wall. They're 2 1/2 and the wall is designed so that older and younger kids can play. The staff also did a great job of helping them so that they could be successful (even if they only got 12 inches off the ground).  Another reason we like Play Factory is Toddler Tuesday. . .kids have unlimited play for $5/each. Not a bad deal. And Desert Ridge is an ideal location. There are tons of kid-friendly restaurants (fthere is also a snack bar at Play Factory) and a splash pad within walking distance."}
{"text":"I checked the website before loading my kids up.  It specifically said \"February 15, open 9 am-2pm.\"  When we got there at 10, we were not the only family dissapointed to see they were closed.  A half hour later we noticed an employee go in the front and I guess they were now open.  Upon getting up to the counter I told the employee that their website says they are open at 9 am today.  \"They told  us 2 days ago to not come in until 10:30 because of birthday parties.\" Um....i don't care who told you what, your website is still wrong and I am a customer.  Word to the wise, an apology for your company's mistake goes a long ways.  Once in, nothing was even blown up.  Luckily it didn't take long.  I bought a groupon, and have also gone on Toddler Tuesday.  Would not pay more than $5 though!"}
{"text":"Although my son loves the bouncy slide here, this place is pretty lame. They have a ton of space here with a lot of it just sitting empty. The staff is useless. Do not go on a weekend. The place is teaming with kids and there is hardly anything to play on so they are all crowded on the slide. The age cut off is 12 so if you have a 3 year old beware, the 12 year olds will literally run your kid over. There is not a single staff member watching over anything, they just sit at the front desk texting on their phones. I actually read the care instructions on the slide itself written by the slide manufacturer and it says the slide must be under \"professional supervision at all times.\" That is not the case and apparently there were no parents of the older kids around so they just dominated the slide pushing down the smaller kids and climbing up the slide instead of the stairs. I wouldn't say never go there, but only go during the week when the older kids are in school."}
{"text":"I brought my godkids (ages 6 and 4)  here for open play and they absolutely loved it!  They are very active kids, and with the rock wall and bounce house,  this was the perfect place to take them. We will definitely be back.  Wish they had one of these in Tucson."}
{"text":"Went to a play date here today. The kids had a blast! My LO is really too young for the big play area so we stayed in the toddler zone most of the time. She really enjoyed the bounce house. They had a nice little snack bar. The staff was very courteous and great with kids. When one of them saw I had a crawler that picked up some paper on the ground, he immediately got another staff member to vacuum. There were a lot of parents that were NOT watching their kids, but that's to be expected everywhere I suppose and is no fault of the employees of Play Factory. I will definitely be back but probably when LO is a little older."}
{"text":"I visited the play factory this weekend and was given great customer by the staff particularly Kaitlynn K. She gave me a great deal and helped me service the cake. My kids had a great time here"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place!!  First off, I am not a cheap person and am willing to pay but this place is a rip off!!!  They allowed WAY too many people in....it was a zoo!!!!  Many children were unattended while their mothers played on their iPads.  They were under staffed.  They have the smallest section for the younger toddlers.... It was chaos.  I will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"My son had his 5th birthday party here and we had a fantastic time. Staff was courteous, place was clean. All of the kids enjoyed themselves and did not want to leave. New owners have free wifi and even the NFL package for the dads to watch. Best part was that the owners came over to ensure everything was to our liking. We have been back to visit during one of their monthly themed parties to see Spider-Man.  Great time! I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Perfect size place for my bunch ages 18 months to 7 yrs.  They do great daily deals and the place is clean!!  You can also have them order pizza for you, from nearby and they have plenty of snacks, drinks on hand that won't break the bank.  The staff was awesome from the front desk to the staff helping out my kids.  Two of my boys actually knocked into each other on the slide, I was tending to my toddler at the time.  Maybe an extra staff person there would help, the kids are wanting to go down two or more at a time."}
{"text":"It was a lot smaller than I was expecting it to be, despite this the kids still had a great time. Plus points; play areas were clean and bathrooms were clean and in good working order, there was lots of comfortable seating for parents in all areas so no matter where your kids where you can sit and watch them easily. We didn't eat so can't comment on that but the kitchen looked well stocked and also tidy. There is no time limit to play and the equipment was all in good working order. Overall it was good but a little basic in it's feel and that's really the only bad point here."}
{"text":"HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE!  Six of six kids at birthday party came down with illness after birthday party.  The two guys that worked there were very nice with helping with the party.  The slides, play area and toddler bouncy were sticky like the bottom of a shoe.  If nobody would have got sick I would have given four stars. The maricopa health department said that all they regulate is that a cleaning plan is in place, not that it is clean.  So beware that you may get more than a good time at the \"play factory\"."}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to be more than what it was. It's extremely small it's states about the adults having having excitement there was nothing exciting about being crammed together. They have a whole bunch of young kids working and most of them didn't know what they were doing. When you call and ask them about their pricing and the groupon pricing I was constantly gettting different answer and I was misconstrued on the info from what they have online and what they offer on groupon. This place need better organization and people who actually know what their doing. It got to the point I didn't finish my daughter's birthday party there we left early and finished our party over at Dave and Busters. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!! Waste of my time driving all the way down and a waste of money I wish I would of had her party anywhere else but there."}
{"text":"The location of the place factory is quite convenient. The setup of the interior is very nice and very organized for children of all ages. the cleanliness of the play area and the restrooms were very nice and well kept. The children at the party did enjoy themselves probably the most exciting part was the rock climbing wall. I do recommend the place factory has a wonderful place to have a child's birthday party girl or boy."}
{"text":"2 stars since my 6 & 8 year old daughters had a blast and want to come back. No more than that since the place is a disorganized dirty mess. The employees are youngsters that know nothing about customer and/or food service, and the place is in general disrepair. There are clearly some health code violations at the snack bars and I certainly won't be snacking there if the kids do convince me to go back (unlikely). Did I mention, however, that they had a blast here. I tried to play Galaga which cost me 50 cents and the joystick didn't work. The gist of the place is a playground and rock wall. The playground is no better than one you would see at McDonald's. The rock wall looked challenging, but a guy my size, large that is, was climbing and could not release from the wall because the rope mechanism would not support his weight. He ended up releasing when he thought he was down far enough and he found out the hard way that he was still too high. Still, 2 stars since my girls put these types of criticisms aside and had a blast playing here. Of course, McDonald's Playlands give them just as good 'a time."}
{"text":"This place has the right idea sort of small but enough has a jump house, slide, and a jungle gym type thing and some video games that are not included in the 10 dollar admission.  The two stars is due to scheduling 4 birthday parties at the same time while remaining open to the public.  The younger kids basically pushed the younger ones around.  Anything over 15 kids at the very max makes it difficult to function in this place there was closer to 35 when we were in-  some chuckie cheese type security check before you leave would do this place well."}
{"text":"We came here during spring break, there are literally 2 people working here. One working the rock wall and the other is the cashier/cook. Too many kids for such a small building including teen-agers. My kids had a blast and it got us out of the house though."}
{"text":"Not worth the money charged!!  Only have one blow up slide and one large climbing item with nylon straps for a three year old to play on. Kids have to be over 40 lbs to use the rock wall and thats only if you can get someone from the front to come into the play area. If you have an infant under 15 months the only inflatable item they have is in the front area, which means you can not watch your three year old in the back. Although they have several hand sanitizers mounted on the wall, all of them were empty. If you prepay for the 5 plays to save some money, be prepared to be harassed by text messages everyday!! If you opt out of receiving their perpetual text messages you lose your prepaid plays. Save your money and take your kids for a movie and ice cream."}
{"text":"Filthy and unsafe are the 2 best descriptors. Everything is dirty. The safety harness on the rock wall is held to the ceiling by duct tape and safety caution tape like you would see at a crime site. A toddler was playing the Xbox by sitting on the counter 4 feet off the ground versus the provided chairs. When asking for assistance with anything, the employees dismissive and unhelpful.  Stay at the desert ridge splash pad if it's hot or go to a local park if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"This is the biggest waste of time and money. Hopefully it shuts down soon. The staff are horrible constantly shutting down the climbing wall randomly likely due to understaffing. They did not care about making the kids who were waiting for 20 minutes cry. Horrible"}
{"text":"Ok...the place is great for little kids, say 8 and under, but my 10 and 12 year olds were entertained for about an hour.  The rock wall is good but you have to climb it with socks.  Can of unsafe as it gets slipper.  The place was clean and the employees were friendly.  Not bad but nothing to get excited about unless it's summer time.  In the summer it would be great because it's indoors with AC.  That's a winner when it's 110 degrees out."}
{"text":"Stay away.  Arrived to a friend's birthday party a little late only to be told we needed socks for the kids to play on the equipment.  One quick trip later from a clothing store, the kids were allowed to leave the dining area.  Little did I know that the play area was closed so the children would eat...closed for the remainder of the party!  The play area was only open for 1 hour of a 2 hour party!?  Does this place even understand why it's open; hint, its not for the food or service."}
{"text":"CLOSED to the PUBLIC on weekends! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Parents want to play with their kids on weekends. Not attend ridiculously overpriced gift collections. Place is small. Place is unsafe. Parents and staff do not supervise kids. Go to the park instead...it is free!!!!"}
{"text":"So..... hummmm... well let's see... I have three daughters... ages 4 years, 8 years, and 11 years... the youngest had a blast... the middle child was not overly impressed but still managed to have fun with her baby sister and the oldest wanted to go as soon as we arrived.....  so if you have a child under 8 it \"might\" be a good place for fun. But again, I say \"might be\".... 4 year olds have fun doing anything anywhere..."}
{"text":"I am a mother of 3 young children and we all love going to The Play Factory at Desert Ridge! All of my kids love climbing up the rock climbing walls and sliding down the slides. My sons love the video game playing areas and my daughter and I have a lot of fun playing Ms. Pacman together. I think the staff members are like wonderful camp counselors with all the kids and they're very helpful and encouraging on the rock climbing walls. We also had my daughter's 4th birthday party at The Play Factory and then 5 kids in her pre-school class all had birthday parties there after that. The Play Factory has truly become the most \"in\" place to have a preschool birthday party. The kids have a great time and so do the parents. We all love the pizza that they order in for the parties. Oh - and the monthly Friday Night Character Dinners are awesome! All in all, I would highly recommend The Play Factory for great, indoor, air-conditioned FUN all year long!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here and the place is so dirty! The sofa is completely broke. It looks ran down. We will never come back!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and thought we would try this place out. It is VERY deceiving, on the website and in person. It is SO small! I turned the corner expecting it to be a huge room with numerous slides, jungles etc., but it pretty much consists of one big blow up slide, one big jungle gym type of thing and a rock wall. He had a great time for the first hour and then kind of looked around like.. \"is this it?\" They had also warned us that a group was coming in, which I appreciated, but I assumed a group would consist of maybe 20 kids. It was a group of 85 kids that were in kindergarten and first grade!!! Not only is this place not conducive for that many kids, but my son would've been trampled in there (he's 3). Anyway, long story short, I was glad that we went on \"Toddler Tuesday\" meaning it only cost us $4.50... I wouldn't pay more than that."}
{"text":"I am actually pretty shocked by all of the 5 star ratings! This place is small, overpriced, and doesn't have healthy lunch options. And if your not going to offer healthy lunch options then you should either allow re-entry or allow outside food to be brought inside. They do not allow either of these options. This is very frustrating considering the price you pay. It is $9 per child. One parent per child can play for free which is nice. But if you have multiple kids this can get very pricy. The children's museum is only $2 more and you can bring your own food or leave for lunch and come back. And it is huge so you can easily spend an entire day there. I would recommend trying that instead. But if you are in the desert ridge area and want to beat the heat, give it a try. Don't forget socks!"}
{"text":"Went there for the opening under new management. Thought it was a good start when we got in before the scheduled time but they made everyone go back outside. They finally let us in 20 minutes after the scheduled opening time.   Once in they had a very small area to buy some slime and get your face painted. They expected everyone to stay within that area and not have the kids go to the main play area.   Speaking of the play area, the main attraction was not ready and still was not when we left an hour later! They were still putting on foam around the poles and the netting.   Pricing is not good either. Pricing for passes as you get more goes up. Typically buying in bulk nets you a better price but not here! Based on normal pricing, the yearly membership only pays for itself if you go there 54 or more times!!!"}
{"text":"My son loves this place but without a Groupon it is a ripoff.  Came on a Sunday for a little fun on my son's birthday and open play was closed until 2:30.  They charged the full $9 price for a mere 1.5 hours of play time that is normally 4 hours.    If he hadn't been so excited I would have walked out for such ridiculousness."}
{"text":"Came here for a children's birthday party. I am not hosting but as a guest the atmosphere of the place in general was okay. There could be way more stuff added to enhance this place especially since Dave and Busters is right across from here. It is only 9:10 and the staff are pulling out cleaning products and started to play the song \"closing time\" really loud to a point where we could not even hear each other and the guy is sitting there laughing about this. So rude! Never would bring my kids to a place like this! I will definetly be talking tk the manager."}
{"text":"My boys had a blast! They are ages 3 & 4, we went on a discounted Toddler Tuesday and it was completely worth it! The place was mostly empty so my kids had plenty of room to run and not have to worry about bumping into someone. The net climber and blow up slide both show signs of wear but the surface wasn't dirty. The wear and tear isn't pretty to look at but the rides function and the kids have fun. My fav feature was the play til you win claw machine. Both my sons wanted to play for the playground balls and I was relieved to see I wouldn't have to overpay for a lil more fun. All in all it was a great way to spend a couple hours and let my kids wear themselves out."}
{"text":"I was l looking for a place to have a party for my niece. I found out about this place online. I happened to be in the area on a Sunday and it seemed to be open based on the doors being open. I walked in and asked if I could look around the play area real quick cause I was interested in hosting a kids birthday party there. The girl in the front told me no. She was a little rude, and said if you were hosting a private party you wouldn't want strangers wandering around. I asked her if she could escort me in just to take a look around. She once again said no and showed me a brochure and said I could look at the pictures. Duh!! I seen those online and drove 40 miles to check this place out with my own eyes. There was no manager on staff. The place looked really small with a bunch of crap I would never serve my child. Will never go there. EVER! NEVER!!"}
{"text":"Pro's - great place to burn energy when the outside temps are too hot to go to the park; love the character dinner nights;  Toddler Tuesdays are affordable.  Con's - as many have said, it is small and there is a huge separation between the baby zone and bigger kids' area, so if you have two kids that are 1 and 4, for ex, you need an extra adult with you.  Non-healthy food options and candy everywhere...I just tell my son \"no,\" but is it even necessary to have all that junk?  And the biggest Con for me is safety.  We went on a day where it was not very crowded, BUT the age range of kids on the blowup slide was probably 3-10.  My four year old got kicked in the face so hard his gums were bleeding, and the employee who was supposed to be watching the slide was oblivious and off doing something else.  I had to chase him down to get ice for my son.  He was concerned, and very nice...I just question the wisdom of allowing twelve year olds (the max age) in the same play space with three and four year olds.  I was watching my son and he still got hurt; so just be aware if you go that the age ranges vary a great deal.  Overall, we still plan to go for character nights etc."}
{"text":"Toddler Tuesday was priced okay as we had the toddler area almost to ourselves the first hour, however, it's not as clean as I would like. My boy got mad because he found snacks under the step stool of the bouncy castle. We brought our own sippycup and snack and ate it there. As there NOT a single healthy item on the menu....oh, yeah, organic milk, but what if your child is lactose intolerant...fairly common. the place is really small and gets crowded fast, brace yourself going there for the summer when school is out. Toddler Tuesdays, during summer will be only up to six years, but it can get full too easy. One other thing that took a star away is the music. Loud and obnoxious pop music with a lot of cussing. Something that shouldn't be played in a kid friendly environment.  Yes, we would go back early mornings and for the toddler Tuesday, but the parents night out and birthday parties. NEVER!"}
{"text":"The staff was extremely unhelpful and unfriendly. You would think for a children's place that they could at least hire people who smiled or wanted to be even slightly customer service oriented. There were three staff members at the front and when I asked if they sold water they all looked at each other and one finally spoke up and sighed and said yes. She then walked to the back concession stand completely bothered that I interrupted her.   Then, the rock wall was supposed to open at 1:00 and there were about five kids waiting to use it. It was now after 1 and all three staff members were at the front taking selfies and socializing. Two different parents went up to ask about opening the rock wall and they had no sense of urgency to open it. The girl finally came back and didn't smile or even talk to the kids. She has the most sour look on her face. I highly doubt we will ever return."}
{"text":"First impressions; small and cramped, very limited play equipment, toddler area barren of toys, activities and run down. Biggest turn off was that it felt dirty. I Ieft feeling creepy and went home to shower! The jump house in toddler area smelled like urine. There was NO supervision of play areas by staff or the majority of parents. I had to ask multiple children to leave toddler area because they were posing  a safety hazard for my grandchildren and well over maximum age of four. My daughter had to physically help remove a child sitting on top of another child and punching him!  Two thirds of the space is wasted for a candy/gift shop, unoccupied tables and video games. Area that could be used for much needed additional play equipment!  New husband/wife owners took over two days earlier. The husband asked and was receptive to my first impressions and concerns. He immediately had the jump house sanitized and was going to use the upcoming holiday to fully clean and sanitize the facility. He is committed to bring the place up to par.  Although I purchased a month pass on Groupon, I don't think I can make myself go back because of feeling filthy when leaving. I wish I felt differently, as I would like to be supportive of the new owners."}
{"text":"This place was OK.  I don't like how they have all these sugary selections in the front of the establishment.  I'd rather them market healthier choices.  The playground itself isn't too big compared to other ones I've been to but it's definitely unique.  I didn't like it b'c climbing that net thing hurt my feet but my toddler had a ball.  There's also a bounce house slide and rock climbing.  I heard a kid say something about an X-box so I'm guessing there's one around there as well.  There's also a toddler area.  The whole layout is just too spread out so if you had a toddler and older child (but still too young to be left unsupervised) it would be a bit of a hassle.  I didn't try any of their food so I comment on that.  It looked like they sold food though."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday party over the weekend and the kids had a great time. The facility had only the one birthday party going on (which I assume happens with all parties), so for about 15 kids and parents, this place was perfect.   The actual play area is pretty small. There is an inflatable slide, a climbing structure, and a rock wall. There is a separate toddler area with a bounce house and some toys so the little ones aren't trampled by bigger kids during open play. They have a few video game consoles and some sit down video games that you can play for an extra charge. The snack bar seemed reasonably priced and had lunchables, drink options, and it looks like you can order pizza and they bring it in from Slices.  The party was fun but I don't think that I would come back for open play. On their website it says that admission is $9 for all day, with no re-entry. Parents are free. For the size, that seems a little steep, not just because it probably gets pretty crowded but the kids would probably get bored after a couple hours."}
{"text":"I took my children there today. My 4 year old loved it. The other two had a good time, but the employees would only let the children climb the rock wall twice. That was disappointing because that isn't stated anywhere on the website or in the facility. There were two employees just chatting near the front entrance almost the entire time. As soon as my girls did the rock wall twice, the employee went back to the front to visit with the other employee. (There were only probably 10 children there total and so they all got 2 chances to climb and then they were done.) I thought that was a rip off and a general lack of customer service. What 10 year old only wants to climb a rock wall twice the entire time they are there? We ended up leaving after about an hour because there are only two structures to play on (a blow up slide and then a climbing structure). {All the video games cost money and they are out front.} The employees weren't mean, I just think they didn't want to help with the rock wall and would rather visit with each other instead--not sure how long you can stay in business that way. Another negative is that so much of the facility is dedicated to selling food. Being located in a mall, I think this is over kill. On a positive note, it appeared clean. All the parents were watching their children. There were plenty of places for parents to sit and watch their children. There weren't any crazy children running around without supervision. There was a separate toddler zone. There were places for shoes. There were ample food and beverage options."}
{"text":"There was a lot to like about The Play Factory.  The best part?  The superb customer service.  Their employees were so helpful and friendly.  They made me and my child feel right at home, despite us using a Groupon for a huge discount!   The main drawbacks?  It just got busy so quickly, which made the smallish space get a bit claustrophobic to me.  Going right at opening time and leaving by 10:30am is your best bet!  My 2 year old had a great time climbing, but I know that my 7-year-old would be bored quickly with only a couple climbers to choose from.  It is a handy escape from the heat, and worth checking out - but come EARLY!"}
{"text":"In the area and wanted to check this place out with my sons. I called ahead to make sure of the hours of operations and that it's open to the public due to any parties going on. Nothing was said when I called, we show up a little after 5 to be told there is a party in a little bit and they will be closing for it. So we wasted our time driving there for nothing, yup pretty much.  My boys were very disappointed to say the least.    Looking at other reviews for here, this seems to happen more often than not. Some sort of communication protocol needs to be put in place so families don't waste their time and money for nothing.   We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I am severely disappointed with this place. I was looking for something to do with my daughter that didn't cost an arm and a leg. So I found this place on Google and it looked pretty cool. The website listed the hours but said to call to make sure there were no parties booked. Thats exactly what I did. I was told that there was only 2 parties booked and that they would have open play at 1pm. I drove all the way up to desert ridge from avondale only to be told that they were closed all day for private parties. I told them I called not more than an hour ago and was told that they were open to the public. All I got was a shoulder shrug. I'm definately not wasting my time by coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party.  My son patiently asked three times for someone to come man the rock climbing wall.  They put him off saying \"in a minute\" for the whole party.  Last 20 minutes someone finally came over.  Hire some people who don't view the party guests as an annoyance!"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have mentioned, this place is small. Half the square footage is taken up by a candy shoppe and concession stand. No offense, but I brought my kid to play- not to eat garbage- there are plenty of restaurants at and around desert ridge that I'd rather dine at. There are also arcade games, which to me was also puzzling. If you're paying to get your kid out of the house to play, and you don't want to be in the heat, wouldn't you want them to be active instead of sitting on their behind playing video games?  Toddler area is TINY. One bounce house. Once jungle gym. The rock climbing wall was cool. The equipment was clean and in good repair, staff was courteous. I just don't think I will be back considering the lack of things to actually climb and bounce on, which for us was the purpose of coming in the first place."}
{"text":"I like this place, I have been coming here since the twins were about 18 months old.  I am glad I don't have to climb with them anymore, though.  Not a fan of all the twirling and tumbling around.  Yeah, not looking forward to roller coaster in the future, but I digress.  What I like the most is when we have birthday parties here, since it is just the friends, I can relax and chat with my mom friends while they climb, slide and tumble around.  Parties are short and sweet, just the way I like them."}
{"text":"So sad to see all these terrible reviews, but the place is under new management and let me tell you we had one awesome birthday party there today! We had 3 staff members who took care of everything! From the timing of the party to gathering up the kiddos for cake everything went perfectly. They also had someone on the rock wall as soon as we asked and the kids loved it! We purchased pizza through them from slices and everyone loved it. I also brought some snacks for the adults and The Play Factory immediately offered small appetizer plates and forks. I was of course weary about booking a party after seeing the reviews but let me tell you this was an awesome party! We had the entire place to ourselves and the kiddos had an absolute blast. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I can see how this place wouldn't be great for older kids.  I'm thinking if your kid is older than 8, then they will probably be bored with this place.  There isn't much to do in here for bigger kids (there's an inflatable slide, a rock climbing wall, and a jungle gym thing in the back) but I think they could get bored in about 20 minutes.  I come for the toddler area.  My son is one and even though he can't maintain balance or jump in the bounce house, he loves it.  I only come on toddler Tuesdays and Thursdays.  With tax it's $4.99 and a great way for the kid to get some energy out when it's too hot outside.  I do prefer going when the place is empty though- other kids who aren't supervised can cause a problem (i.e. leaving the gate open to the toddler area or being too rough with the little ones)."}
{"text":"My 16 month old and 4 year old did have fun here.    However, I do believe there this place needs some major and minor maintenance.  The toilet in the bathroom (women's handicap stall) is missing the top of the toilet.  There is a sign that says to press in the middle of the top of the toilet in order to flush.  Not only does this turn my stomach because its disgusting, but a kid could get hurt touching this open area (like the top is completely open where the water runs and has been this way for months).    The slide was dirty just like the other posts have mentioned, but what is more upsetting are two other things:  Their slide is ripping apart in many places, the climbing stairs, one was missing and I literally saw some smaller kids falling down because they could not reach to the next step level.  No one is watching the kids who tend to gather at the bottom of the slide and stay there to jump...which is fun and great but I watched 4 kids get hurt in the 1 hour I spent in that area alone.  Most parents do watch their kids but sometimes it is impossible to get up to your kid fast enough who is falling because the steps are broken on their way up!  The Play Factory would really benefit with a few more staff members.  Perhaps, you could have one of your staff members watch the slide area just when it is the busy times to help the kids get out of the way when others are sliding down the slide.    The hand sanitizer pumps were out of sanitizing solution.    The under 4 year (baby) area had exposed electrical outlets (2) that were not covered and one was coming out of the wall.  The basketball hoop was also coming out of the wall in this small area..I looked behind and saw the screws were loose.    It would really be beneficial in my opinion if you want moms, dads, caretakers to return to fix what is broken and to clean everything....everyday!  I did not see one staff member cleaning anything while I was there. We want to support our local Desert Ridge marketplace but its hard with the items I mentioned above."}
{"text":"My girls (age 6 & 8) love coming here for the Parent's Night Out.  It costs me $25 each to drop them off to play and have pizza from 7pm-11pm.    I wish the hours were 6pm to 10pm instead.  Also, my daughter said the pizza wasn't very good last time.  However, the pros outweigh the cons and we are fans."}
{"text":"It small and most of the moms don't really watch their kids. If my niece wasn't twice the size of the boy that punched her to try and get her off a thing he wanted I would have yelled at the mom that seemed more upset that her son was crying over her not moving than the fact he was trying to injury another child. However she had fun and don't seemed fazed by the boy's menacing attempts. Five dollar Friday before a holiday is crazy packed with kids."}
{"text":"This is not a place you are likely to stay all day because of the size. But with a child under six, you could spend a good two hours here. I read some other reviews that are down on it for being so small, but I imagine it costs a fortune to maintain even a small place in this economy. I'd say the concession area has to be that size for parties, which are likely a large part of the revenue stream. I look at it for what it is: an opportunity to let little ones run around and burn off some steam while the guardian gets to breathe for a minute. I was thankful for this and thought the employees were quite friendly."}
{"text":"My son just had to go hear. I promised him I would take him to a bouncy house. He is 5 and had a ball. But in my opinion the place could be much better. There is potential, but the biggest problem I could was understaffing. There seemed to be only 2 employees trying to run the whole place.  While they were great with the kids, there was just too much for them to do. Supervision, checkin, food and many more things to do. Give your employees more help and you should do great."}
{"text":"We love the Play Factory!   We come here all the time with my 3 year old and 8 month old. It's nice that they have a smaller children's area where she can crawl around safely while my son can burn off tons of energy without burning himself on the scorching park playgrounds.   This place is always clean, they keep the air down low, and if you go on Toddler Tuesdays/Thursdays (half off), it's an affordable way to keep your kids busy.   My only complaint is the lack of seating within visual range of the bigger play area, and the fact that you can't bring your own snacks. I know that they want to make money off of the crackers and cookies, but I prefer to bring my son fresh fruit or a sandwich so he doesn't come home with a sugar high.   Groupon always has great summer deals, we just purchased an unlimited month for $19, so check them for deals too."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic birthday party here on 6/27/15 for my twins girls' 1st birthday! I was worried about a few reviews I read prior to our party but I'm so glad we decided to try it out and judge for ourselves!  The staff that worked our party was Nathan, Summer and Colin. The manager I worked with on the phone prior to the party was Desiree. It's my understanding that Management is not usually there for the evening parties.  We had a great experience! Here are the details:  -Awesome and attentive staff -Management and staff were professional, organized & very accommodating.  -Facility was very clean and well maintained. -All special requests for our party were fulfilled.  -I was able to call multiple times to go over info and they were always very friendly and professional.  -Staff was attentive to those eating and playing (especially the rock climbing wall.)  -Food was a hit! Pizza is ordered from a place called Slices. DELICIOUS!!  Two days before our party Desiree called to review all details about the birthday party.   -Kids and adults had a fantastic time  -Reasonably priced   -This is our new birthday party spot now that we live in AZ! My family and friends feel the same way! Wish we discover this place sooner."}
{"text":"I stopped by here tonight with my five year old son with the idea of having a fun night for him with other kids and me eating at North.  The price is simply outrageous at over $25 per child for a few hours of pizza and playing with other children.  My son complained that the portion was tiny and I had to take him out to eat afterwards.  The women who operate are simply rude and obnoxious.  Once the place is full they shoo kids and parents out of there like flies on a horse.  This place is small and cramped and not worth leaving your child.  Next time my boy is joining us for dinner.  Avoid this overpriced trap at all costs."}
{"text":"So this place needs a good deep clean. All they do is have kids running this place. My son asked one of him to climb the walk wall and he told my son he was busy and he will go over there later. Then this kids went to the front desk to start text messaging on his phone. He is lucky I didn't pick him up and throw him off the rock wall for talking to my kid like that. They get a one star because one of the girls put the tv on sports center for me."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time or money taking your children here. The McDonald's playplace is nicer! Took my son here seeing they only charge $5 for entry. When I walk in, I was mortified. All the games they have are extremely old. The rides are terrible. They have one small play structure and a bouncy house. I've been to many backyard birthday parties that have nicer bounce houses than this. My son  was bored within a couple minutes of being there. Also, a child threw up on the floor. A parent went to inform the staff member. He walked back from the counter to the vomit several times looking completely lost about about what to do & was on his phone probably seeking some guidance and didn't do anything to address the situation. Didn't clear the kids out of the play area, attempt to block off the mess so kids wouldn't run through it, or clean it up in any way. After watching this for several moments, I was completely disgusted and just left. NEVER AGAIN. This place shouldn't cost more than $1 for entry if that. The rock wall they advertise was also closed down."}
{"text":"The place is under new ownership & the young lady & her family are motivated to upgrade the place & bring it back to life so kids can have a fun, safe, memorable experience! The employees are awesome too! Great people!! Looking forward to The Play Factory in the future!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to let the kids run during the hot summer temps. The inside/play area is smaller than I anticipated, but my kids don't seem to care.   The only employee I've seen has the patience of a saint. Taking payments at the front door, hooking kids up to the climbing wall, supervising the kids of parents who can't be bothered, vacuuming and cleaning...she's doing it all."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm easy to please, but this place isn't bad.   Being that I wasn't brave enough to have more than one child, my daughter needs to get out of the house if she wants to play with people her age. The Play Factory is a decent place to accomplish that goal.  Now, being that my daughter is only three, we get to enjoy the awesome Toddler Tuesday pricing ($4.00). At that price, I feel like I'm getting a bargain. I mean, she gets interaction from peers, and she burns off all kinds of energy with all of the running and climbing. That ends up benefiting EVERYBODY!  Now, the place (for toddlers) isn't all that extensive. If you have a child with a shorter than average attention span, they might run out of things to do in a hurry. Thankfully, my daughter only suffers from light to moderate A.D.D., so she enjoys herself immensely.  One really cool feature about this place is the indoor rock wall. I was a little apprehensive to let my daughter try it, but I'm glad I did. She LOVED it. Of course, there are plenty of safery precautions, so there really wasn't any reason to be nervous.  After reading some of the negative reviews about this place, I can only assume that they were from the parents of older children. This place has a FEW things for them to do, but for the price, it's probably better to find something else. There are a few video games and whatnot, but older kids aren't really afforded the same energy-expending opportunities as the toddlers.  If you have low-maintenance toddlers, they'll certainly enjoy running circles around this place for an hour or two."}
{"text":"Took my 2 year old nephew here for \"Toddler Tuesday\" (where you pay half-price for kids under 4: $4.50 vs. reg. $9). We read the rules before hand and left all snacks and drinks at home, and walk it to find parents drinking lattes from Starbucks... The front lobby includes a huge (in comparison to the size of the building) candy store (of course where the candy is low enough for the children to get into) and the snack bar serves mostly junk food: candy, pizza, cotton candy, soda, icees, etc. although they did have juice box, organic milk and gogurt. The parent seating was limited unless you wanted to be in the snack area (a separate room from the play area and this would be necessary if busy)  Was disappointed that the \"Play\" factory had a video game and movie set up... Although I saw the staff vacuuming play area and cleaning the restrooms, overall the play area felt dirty (dust under and around back of play area, netting in play area is brown), and I was extremely displeased to see the exposed electrical outlets, unpadded wall corners and the 1ft step to get in and out of the main play area (difficult for a 2 year old to get over)  Overall, I feel like deep down there is a great idea here, unfortunately the execution was cheap and poorly done...  Hope they use their profit to destroy this play area and try again, otherwise not sure we will be back..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed after not being here for a few years!! There aren't many things to do. One smaller climbing structure and one inflatable slide. Very small and pricey. Definitely do not recommend this place. Take a drive and head to the other play places in the valley. The Children's Museum, Makutus island, Luv 2 Play in Surprise as well as others I'm sure I don't know of. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Just an update. My last review was not a good one.. Returned for yet another birthday party..its allot better. They put some money into the establishment. There's tvs,couches and abit more color. Same play stuff for the kids ..which is why its a 3 star review. Its just a limited place to do anything."}
{"text":"Very unhelpful unfriendly downright rude staff. Yes, I realize this isn't your dream job folks, but you do Work here. Staff were socializing with other teens (non staff or customers) at the front desk despite a line at the snack bar. Once finally summoned the exchange was atrocious. Staff were eating food behind the counter while preparing food for customers. Yuck and a health code violation I'm sure. We'll never go back after such a poor experience"}
{"text":"Perfect place for younger kids! I was looking for a place to take my two grandkids (3 and 1 year old) to have fun and beat the AZ  heat.  WOW! This is the perfect place particularly on Toddler Tuesday and Thursday.  When we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by the Manager/Owner Simon.  The place is open, not huge and not too small.  The bright red sparkly entry floors just made you want to smile and got the children excited from the moment we entered.  Areas are separated for different activities.  We were lucky as it was a toddler day and since we arrived late morning we did not have to worry about separating the little ones from older kids. However, there is a separate gated area for the littlest ones--our one-year old spend most of his time here. Our three-year-old loved the climbing slides and meshed floor climber.    Pros:   Open, clean, colorful, little-child friendly environment. Great place to work-off energy with lots of bouncy things to do. Most everything is trimmed in rubber for safety.  Toddler-Day pricing is reasonable to allow for more frequent visits. Caretaker can remove shoes and join the younger ones to help them navigate the more challenging spots. It is small enough to keep track of the kids easily. Separate toddler area with its own bounce house. The climber has lots of different and fun activities throughout.  This is about a 1.5 to 2 hour activity including a snack break. The parents and caretakers all seemed to be watching their kids and involved.    Cautions: Lots of candy for sale.  Yes, they have applesauce and some healthy choices but the candy and treats are so colorfully displayed (and within kids reach) that it make the fruit look dull by comparison.  You can order Pizza. If you are going to do this you might order when you first arrive and request it for a specific time.  I think hot-dogs were also available.  We purchased some crackers and informed the kids that we would be going next store for lunch after play.  That seemed to satisfy everyone.  Sans a medical condition, outside food is not allowed but personal water is fine.  Tip:  Show kids how to walk on the webbing--and alert them what to do if and when they mis-step and their foot goes thru a space.  I saw this happen to  a little girl and she (understandably) panicked thinking her leg had been gobbled up."}
{"text":"Nice little place to let the kids burn energy and the parents to relax,  watch them play all while watching the game lol place is pretty clean everytime me, my daughter and her cousins come here....and cheap on $5 Fridays, never threw a birthday party here but I like it, judge for yourself, some \"Yelppers\" expect too much for something chill and cheap lol me I'm a simple Dad."}
{"text":"There are several things that went wrong here and because of this experience I will never have a party outside of my home.  This year I was not planning on throwing my daughter her party,as her dad wanted to this year. Well, unexpectedly he was no longer able to do so and I was given a months notice of this. On March 15th I booked an opening at The Play Factory and problem 1 happened. I received a call either later that day or the following saying I was not able to have my party at that time because it was booked already. Umm, then why was I able to book it online? Also, I had been looking at my  options for a week and this slot had been open throughout that week as well. Not to mention the voicemail that was left was just..terrible! So, I call back and let them know this was very inconvenient for me since I had sent out the invitations to be made already and had set up an event on Facebook with that time. I was told after a brief hold that I would be getting my price cut to half of the total ( the total was given to me online after booking because I had already selected everything I wanted in regards to food and extras) I thought \"Okay terrific! They are willing to work with me, I will continue my service there.\" A few days went by and I came across Yelp, I read the reviews and was just HORRIFIED , I began to get worried that my daughters party was going to be a disaster so I called the manager, Jessie, who I went over a list with of things I wanted to do or take to make sure it was okay to do so. I also asked him if hes aware of the reviews on Yelp and seemed rather annoyed to hear me say this. He said yes to all of my requests over the phone but once the day came I knew nothing was written out for me. Before I get to the actual day of the party, I also want to point out that I made the drive there a couple weeks before the actual date to see the place and go over everything with the staff. I arrived and they couldnt find my reservation!! WHY? Well, I was put down for an incorrect time slot!! (IMAGINE IF I WOULD HAVE NEVER WENT IN TO CHECK IN). The manager was called and they said the time could be moved to where it should have been (per phone call). Okay great, also I asked how long in advance can I be there to help decorate for the party.. I even explained that I am big on D.I.Y decorations and have several little things that need attention before the party begins. These two boys told me I would be able to get there as early as an hour because there were no other parties reserved and because of the confusion with the reservation time..Okay great, I leave thinking the trip there should have smoothed everything out for the party, forget the bad reviews.. the party was going to be great.  The day arrives, I call 35 minutes before the party time to see if things were okay and to le them know im on the way and due to the rain and traffic I would be late. Hung up and called back once I got off the freeway and was around the corner.. they told me they were still trying to get people out. I ask for their help and they say theyd be out with a cart. I arrived, no cart noone waiting.....after 10 minutes of being outside, I went inside and one was surprised about my request.. I grab the cart and head down for the things to my car with one of the girls trailing behind me. Once we grabbed everything, we went inside and it was 10 minutes untill my party time (or less) and there were still people inside for open play, tables dirty, floor a mess, things out of place...Finally everyone's out and I have to move the tables myself then my friend shows up.. and if it wasnt for her... it would have been so much worse. The staff members had zero pep in there step. One taking her time vacuuming, another taking her time with computer.. I let them know right off the bat I needed help with labeling, setting up the table, setting up the balloons, setting up the special decorations I made. My friend helped me with most of this..4 guests arrived while we were still decorating. So throughout the party, there was no one available for the rock climbing wall and I had to be on their backs about what I ordered. (I.e- hey I had this for snack, extra balloons, etc) I had the manager called so much because the girls were clueless about my special requests (the ones i spoke with with the manager directly). They could tell I was flustered and kept telling me to relax and enjoy the party but how could I? Everything was behind schedule and they werent doing anything but wait for me to command something of them.. The manager was aware of this craziness going on and refused to give me a good price to extend the party further. let me shorten this up, I had to end up paying so much more than what I was told because  I had no proof of the conversation I had when I was given the half off quote because of the inconvenience. the manager was called again and he was annoyed and passed me over to his wife. The price only got higher and higher."}
{"text":"This play has gone down hill in the past few  years. The equipments is torn and patched with tape over tape.  The biggest thing that caught my eye is how dirty the place is. ...  see the pictures. ....   kids love playing here but until they clean there place I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Best place for a Toddlers Party.   We held our 4 yr old's birthday party here. The party was an absolute blast. The kids had so much fun and the place easily accommodated the 24 kids and the 35+ Parents that accompanied them.  Staff were amazing. The three ladies and the guy running around and serving the guests and cleaning up behind the kids and the adults alike were absolutely fantastic.   They arranged everything for us including food and drinks, setup the place and cleaned up with amazing efficiency.   They kids had four big areas to play, two bouncy areas, one jump and climb area with a huge slide and a rock climbing wall. The staff were so good to the kids and helped our party to be successful.  Would definitely recommend this place for private parties. Would not recommend the public play time for small kids as it is a bit chaotic with the mixed age kids."}
{"text":"My son is 19 month old and I clarify this to be fair with the business   The place should not be targeted to toddlers! They do have a chalk board and some letter tiles but those are not worth $9 admission. It would be ok if I come with a 6 yr old and a toddler and the toddler gets free entry but to come in with a toddler only is certainly not worth the time or money.  Also - even for older kids - I saw a few enjoy the climbing wall and the castle and the slide BUT they were there only for maybe 30 min and then some went to play at the arcade type area. If the arcade section is included in the price then I'd say it's worth it but If those are charged per use then NO.  Recommendation for the business: reconsider including walking toddlers in the free entry"}
{"text":"Our girls love the play factory! Great place for your kids to have fun and burn some energy!"}
{"text":"This place should go out of busines. It's dirty and small with only one employee working. My kids hated it."}
{"text":"Website and staff both provided misinformation about the time this business opens today. The result of this was that we had to lead our two disappointed children away crying.   Very disappointed in the lack of accountability and accurate information, especially from this business that we have patronized often over the past 2+ years"}
{"text":"I am a mom of 3.  Our first visit here was very frustrating.  There was a fieldtrip there during our visit and it was way too crowded.  We gave it another shot and it was better but there are still some really irritating things about it. I find it so frustrating that they do not allow you to bring your own food when all they offer is junk. Also, having to walk by the candy to go in is just stupid.  Clearly this is not a place that cares about the well-being of children but is looking for every angle to make money.  It is also unnecessary to have TVs on while kids are jumping and playing.  When parents are paying a lot to enter they certainly don't want their kids sitting and watching TV.  I think there are some good roots to this place. I only hope they take some steps to make it a positive experience for parents and children."}
{"text":"I posted a review on Facebook that the owner responded to but completely missed my points so I'm going to post here in order to make sure others understand the concerns I had as they weigh their options for play places in the area. One of the attendants working the day we were there was SCREAMING at the kids to get their attention for those who did not have socks on. It's fine that socks are required but there were literally no signs posted indicating that but that does NOT excuse their employee from screaming at a group of 6 to 10 year olds about it. Had we not been there to attend a friend's birthday, I would have left with my son at that point. I won't patronize any business that treats kids this way especially when it's a business geared to children. A few minutes later this same employee started SCREAMING AGAIN at a couple of the kids who were trying to climb up the soft slide. I understand it's a safety hazard if someone is coming down the slide at that time, but there wasn't anyone coming down. Again, I don't have an issue with safety concerns being addressed but screaming at paying guests is not the way any employee should behave no matter what. For those reasons alone, we'll never return, however, I should also mention that the place could use a thorough cleaning. The rock wall in particular looked sketchy from a cleanliness standpoint and was missing several grips so it doesn't appear to be maintained well. Last but not least, the place is small with very limited play equipment (literally it has one rock wall, one jungle type gym and one blow up slide) so if you're expecting something more, you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've had my son's birthday party there and it was great. But today was a complete disappointment. Hours are posted that they open at 10am for open play. I show up at just after 10, their doors are locked. So I wait for 20 minutes in Barnes and Nobles. At 10:20, their doors are unlocked. We go inside only to be ushered out because it's booked for a birthday party. Nothing is posted on the door. Nothing is on their website. I just wouldn't have come rather than deal with a screaming child. Ultimately, if you go to the place, either do it for a birthday party or check, double check triple check when their open play hours start."}
{"text":"I would love to say how wonderful this place is and how much fun my children had... however that's not the case. We have tried to come.and play twice, and both times were told that they have a private party starting in 20 minutes and they'll be closing to the public..keep in mind that the website States that they have open play until 6 pm on Sunday, and we showed up 3 hours before.  The moral to this story is call first. However I won't be visiting this establishment anymore."}
{"text":"My daughter has a lot of fun here. They have lots of random activities for kids here. If you get a Groupon the price isn't bad, but otherwise it's expensive. My one complaint is that it is not very secure. Your kid could basically just walk out the door and no one would notice."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I brought my active 21 month old boy and the big blow up slide and jungle gym were too scary to him. The other area for babies with a bounce house and some toys was more his style but he grew bored of that quickly as it was a tiny area. That was pretty much all they had to do here for kids. I'm glad we came on a discounted admission day because there isn't much here for kids in my opinion, even for the older ones. I've seen a similar jungle gym at mcdonald's playgrounds to use for free. I may try bringing my boy back when he's older to see if it is a place he would enjoy - but again - not much selection for the price."}
{"text":"Kinda lame. It's a large space with not as many things for the kids to do as you would think. The rock climbing was closed, so there was one bouncy slide and one jungle gym. One toddler bounce house that was small. Also, a girl fell out of the slide entrance and hit her head on the hard plastic stool, then floor. Put a mat down!"}
{"text":"This is the bottom of the barrel as far as kids \"play zone\" businesses go.  The place is dark, filthy and borderline dangerous.  The main climbing structure has numerous damaged areas on it, including one area that is designed for kids to jump up and down - with a steel pipe running directly underneath it - with the padding piece hanging off.   All of the couches are discolored like they haven't been cleaned in years, and the \"bounce house\" is PITCH BLACK inside because there are dozens of lights out.  We asked the employee to turn some lights on in the bounce house since our 2 year old was scared to go inside, and she said \"yeah, we told our manager about the lights and he said they are really expensive to replace\". Lol - they charge NINE dollars per kid, and over 50% of the square footage in the place is just arcade games you have to pay extra for.  Don't even bother going in the bathrooms. It's very surprising that the Maricopa county health inspector has not closed this place down already."}
{"text":"Can I give a thousand stars!      New owners! As of last few weeks this amazing place is under new ownership! New everything! New jungle gym and bounce house! The jungle gym has many fun obstacle courses and a huge slide! The bounce house has a basketball bounce area and a slide! The toddler station is all new too! Great fun learning toys! My baby loved the balls and the colorful rocking toys! My daughter loved the play food and of course the big kid play area! This place is perfect for physical excercise and social and brain development. They also have a huge chalk board and three rock climbing walls, arcade and big screens for video games! I am beyond impressed by the customer service here! The owners are absolutely wonderful as well as their wonderful employees! This place is so kid friendly and adult friendly. So nice for parents if they just want to relax when watching their kids. There is seating everywhere and in their eating area. They sell snacks and drinks and homemade Cotten candy which my daughter loved!!  Most importantly It is extremely clean. It is clear that the owners take pride in their new business. I was told that they are going to start doing special events too! I love the great prices!"}
{"text":"I did not feel that addressing the poor experience we had at the Play Factory would improve anything, and didn't feel the need to make things even more unpleasant for us and our guest. The fact is that I have 5 children and have had many birthday parties at several other kid venues around the valley and yours was lacking to say the least. So please allow me to clarify your confusion.   1. You called to confirm our reservation, and yet when we arrived, at 3:10p, there was no party set up and all the tables were dirty.  So what exactly did my $50 groupon pay for? The three balloons and use of your nasty tables? ANY other venue would have a table set up and ready for our arrival. 2. I paid an additional $50 for 1 pepperoni pizza, 4 pitchers of soda, and 1 small gluten free pizza for 6 kids....I've paid far less, for much more. 3.I then paid an additional $50 for admission and use of your facility which we found to be subpar. The floors and over all cleanliness of your facility was poor.... And the bathrooms were gross.  4. I didn't mention this in my review about the fact that your staff allowed such rough behavior by other patrons, to include the fact that my daughter was choked on the slide and another of our guest was pushed and bullied to the point that we had to intervene to prevent this 2 year old from being injured was Unsatisfactory indeed. In closing I paid $150 for no decorations, over priced food and a small & subpar facility with poor customer service.  I understand that you must deal with unhappy customers on a regular basis, and normally I would say nothing, but it is wrong to post a groupon in order to scam people out of their hard earned money. And it is my duty as a parent and fellow grouponer to make sure that anyone considering to purchase that groupon, be aware that the Play Factory is a complete rip off!   Sincerely, Carrey Vacha"}
{"text":"We went to a birthday party here just this past weekend. There's a lot to like about this place; it's small and there was only 1 party going on during the time we were there. Our friends had a LOT of kids there-so I can't imagine during open play, how crowded this place must get. Like other reviewers have said, it's small, so it's fairly limited. My toddler rode on the couple of coin operated cars and we hung out in the toddler section. That had some balls, pads to crawl on, a mini jump section, and some other toys. I like that they had high chairs during food time. Staff was friendly and attentive. Bathroom was spotless!! There is a changing table, and when I told the attendant there was no bag in the diaper bin, she promptly put one in. Cute place!"}
{"text":"This place looks like it could be more fun. They have a play place more gravitated towards the video game crowd. It has a very small space for toddlers and too much cafeteria space. We come here for the rock wall and that takes about 10 minutes of our time. It would be nice to see them change the layout for the age group they are trying to attract."}
{"text":"Review Part 1, the adult perspective: The Play Factory was expensive, looked dirty and did not have a good variety of activities. The $9 admission included the use of one large inflatable slide and a large obstacle course play structure. If you are a toddler there is a separate area with a bounce house (Toddlers also cost $9). There are other video games and rides that you can also pay for and a snack bar with plenty of seating. There are better indoor playgrounds to choose from but if you are at desert ridge and need to escape the heat for a little bit it will suffice.   Review Part 2, the kid perspective: After going through the large obstacle course a few times, I was told by a 5-year old \"this is awesome\"!!   Basically, kids will have fun anywhere. However, the adults pay for it, so please know there are much better and more well kept indoor playgrounds in Phoenix but it's not the end of the world if you go here."}
{"text":"This place is very good, with a caveat:  it is not the kind of place to let your toddler / young child run free while you stare at your smart phone.    This may come as a shock, but parents, you should supervise your child!  I have 4 year old twins and I kept a constant eye on them not only to make sure they were not misbehaving but also to keep them out of harms way from the other kids who were running a bit wild.  There are only a few activities here so when it gets busy things get crowded, I am amazed that many parents do not tell their kids to wait their turn, not shove in front of other kids, be careful around the little ones, not walk up the face of a slide when other kids are sliding down them, etc.    If you want them to babysit for you this place will be a disappointment.  If you want a nice air-conditoned activity to keep your kids happy and let them expend some energy with you supervising then you will really like this place.  Also, children need to weigh 40 lbs to use the climbing wall."}
{"text":"I took my 2-year-old here for the first time last week. He enjoyed it, but was ready to leave after about 45 minutes. I might go here from time to time, but I don't think it will be a regular place for us. It didn't seem like there was enough to keep him busy. I was really turned off by the coin operated video games and rides too. After paying to get in, I don't want to pay for anything else. Also, the layout was a little disjointed. There are two main play areas and they are completely separate from each other, so whenever my little one wanted to go the the other area I had to pick up and move with him."}
{"text":"For a while this place took a bit of a dip in most areas. This kids started bugging me to go again so we stopped in today and the old, original owner is back!! The place is cleaned up nice and staff much nicer. It was great to get out of the heat for a bit and the kids had a blast. Mine are 5 & 6 years old."}
{"text":"Everyone must read before planning on booking a party here. You guys knew it was coming. Okay so let me start off by saying we are not a picky family. We chose this place because it gets down to business, feed the kids and let them have fun for a little while. The price was decent (didn't cost an arm and a leg) and it really looked like a fun place to throw a 3 year olds birthday party without all the stress that comes from hosting a big party at home. Booking was a breeze so I was very happy about that. I was also stress free because they offer to decorate your party any theme for a fee which was well worth it for us. So fast forward to the day of the event. This was our first time visiting and it was really hard for us to find the place because it's in a big shopping center where it is surrounded by stores, most of our guests had never been there either so mostly everyone showed up late.  As I was walking in I was expecting to see a little section decorated (because that's what we paid for) and everything ready to go. Boy was I wrong. As we were walking in (right when the party was set to start and guests were supposed to arrive) I noticed that the employees were barely putting the table cloths on the table. They looked so careless and didn't even look like they cared that the party was about to start. So I asked to see a manager but guess what yelp, no manager on duty. It was just those 2 kids running that whole building by themselves!!! No wonder they were behind!!! So I then ask to speak to a manager over the phone, I expressed to her my disappointment in having to walk in and basically set up everything myself because those kids were busy helping other customers! There were a few people from our party already there and I couldn't even converse with them or offer them a place to sit or drinks because I still had to set everything up!!! Okay, so i set everything up and we order the food and I still don't have a chance to sit down and mingle with our family and friends because the employees are busy tending to other customers to where they could care less what is happening with our party. I assumed that booking a party at a place of business meant you would have someone making sure everything is taken care of such as filling pitchers and offering assistance. Nope, every party for themselves there.  The kids from our party kept running up to me and said they really wanted to try the rock climbing but that the employee told them they had to wait for him. I had to ask him 3 times for him to actually go let them rock climb and even then he was only there for 5 minutes and then ran off to do other things. So the kids only got to climb the wall once.  It's just so inconvenient to throw a party somewhere where they promise to have things ready and it's far from that. To make matters worse, they booked a party right at the time ours was supposed to end, the employees came up to me and said \"we have another party coming in 5 minutes so you guys have to be gone.\" It was 4 35 and we were booked until 4 45. Uh excuse you, I'm paying for 2 hours and I spent the first 20 doing things that should have already been done, so im using up every single minute I paid for!!!! I can't not believe that an establishment that prides themselves on throwing great parties would book a party back to back with no time in between to get things sorted out!!! You know what, from this place its believable.  I booked this place because I thought it would put less strain on an already stressful day, but being that the employees were left to fend for themselves because there was no manager on duty left me doing everything for my sons party. I wouldn't mind having done everything myself, but I would have appreciated a heads up!! It was so embarrassing to have to apologize to our guests for the lack of prep and for not having much time to actually enjoy their company. Most of our guests looked upset and annoyed at the way things went down, and that really sucks because we just wanted everyone to enjoy themselves. I'm am just so frustrated at the fact that they would even book a part this size with only 2 employees to run this entire establishment! Why on earth would management think that is okay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why would they not have at least one person dedicated to the party, why would they not even have a manager on duty on a weekend when it's the busiest!!!!!! I will never again book a party here. I would much rather pay more and actually get to enjoy my son and our guests. Don't book here. Unless they make some serious changes in their management and training their employees on how to handle party's, don't waste your time or money!!!!!! Actually the best thing you can do if you plan to book here, look on google for a park near by, and celebrate there. You will save money and I guarantee it would be less stressful than this place, I know because we have celebrated my sons birthday at a park before and it was less stressful than this place!"}
{"text":"We wanted to do something that would allow my daughter time to run around and hang out with other kids. I thought it was a great deal for $5. After dinner and shopping we arrived at 915pm. It closes at 10pm. When we were first greeted, we were asked how could they help us. Of course we came in to use the play area, we were then told by the young man in the front \"Are you sure you want to pay, we close at 10pm\" I think if a customer comes in willing to try out your facility you should have some better customer service skills. I knew the facility hours and I think $5 is not a bad price to pay for 45 minutes of play time.Some customer service training may be needed to avoid future loss of business. Desert Ridge has many options for us to enjoy, our business will be going else where in the future. The only reason I gave this facility 2 stars is beause my daughter did have a good time."}
{"text":"I took my kids, ages 6, 2, and 9 months, one day because it was just too hot to play outside. They all three had a really great time! We went on a Tuesday so my two year old got in at a discounted price (and my 9 month old was free anyway) so I paid very little for unlimited play. There was a large blow up slide, a rock climbing wall, and a large climbing structure with slides. It was enough to tire the kids out and I liked that they were open all day rather than just having a two hour period with open play like many bounce house places do.   I was slightly disappointed that the play area was as small as it was. I would probably make a point to only go on Tuesdays and Thursdays for the discounted toddler price. There was limited seating in the immediate area for parents so many people were kind of standing around awkwardly  trying to dodge the playing kids. There was additional seating in the snack bar area, but I wasn't personally comfortable moving that far away from where my two year old was playing (I would have had to completely leave the main area to take my younger kids over to the smaller area). I also with the toddler play area was a bit closer, but I can also see the benefit of separating it from the larger play area so that the employees aren't constantly having to ask older kids to stay out of it."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon for 5 visits while visiting Arizona, my 3 yr old loved it, great place for jumping, climbing and using up energy. Perfect for 2-5 year old range."}
{"text":"My kids had so much fun here! I got to shop around a little and then take them to play. It was really convenient. I love that they have an attendant at the rock climbing wall at all times making sure the kids are taking turns and being safe. He's also really nice as well. The kids loved tumbling around on the indoor climbing unit. The video games are a great addition as well. Bought some passes and will be coming back again soon. Don't forget socks for the kiddos!"}
{"text":"Three stars because it started out as five, but I wasn't happy about two things. Yes, it was fun for the kids and nice and all, but the employees/customer service needs working on. Like many other reviews state about misinformation or general unhelpfulness, I experienced that before we even got here.   We called because we were lost inside the center and couldn't find the place. The guy that answered the phone was having a side convo and was VERY unhelpful. He said this place was south of albertson's by target in the marketplace. Uh, no. That would be incorrect. 15 minutes later, I call back and the girl says to park across from barn's & Nobel and walk into the center and the play factory is across from Dave and busters. Ok, that's more like it. Definitely someone more helpful. We find the place. We come in, we're greeted by mr. Unhelpful. We get a plate of food and sit down and let our kid play. Second thing I didn't like at all is the kid behind the concession counter was the drink nazi. For $10 for a small pancake and some fake eggs, we should get a little lousy drink without being harassed. I poured a cup of coffee that was like water and went to grad a juice for my kid and the guy says, \"one per person, ONE PER PERSON!\" Sheesh, you would have thought he paid for them out of his own pocket. Plus, they are the mini sized kid's drinks, so come on, boy, chill!   Everything seemed clean and it was ok because my son is older (8.5) so I didn't have to follow him around like a Sargent, but the employees are definitely LAZY. They all sit around or stand behind the counter and chit chat. People, it's a JOB, WORK!! Help supervise the kids, run the rock wall, go around and play, don't just stand there with your arms crossed and talk all day."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places, but it really seems to have gone downhill.  Everything used to be spotless and the facility was always well lit, cool, and airy.   Today it feels dirty and gloomy.   Bulbs are burnt out, lots of things are in need of minor repair, stock is low, it's warm.   It feels neglected.   So sad.   :-("}
{"text":"I took my 3 year old grandson & 1 year old granddaughter for an afternoon.  It was a great time.  The tall slide is fast and fun.  My  grandson was able to maneuver himself in the climbing nets and jumping areas.  The big draw was the climbing wall.  The gentleman working was more than happy to put the climbing belt on him and give him the basics of climbing.  My grandson loved it.  There is an area for little tykes like my 1 year old.  She had a good time in the baby play area that was more mellow.  There are arcade games and a concession area for lunch.  Everything seemed in tip top shape.  They offer kids foods like mac & cheese, lunchables, hot dogs, nachos, ice cream, juice, milk & more.  The staff was very attentive.  They were very happy and helpful.  We had a great time.  We will go again."}
{"text":"This place is TINY.  It's quite deceiving from the outside.  The front area is quite large - it has a concession stand and seating area for birthday parties.  There's also a corner to play video games and a small area for toddlers to play in. But when you walk around the corner to the actual \"play area\", it shocks you to how small it is.  It consists of one giant bounce slide (the one's you can rent for your home parties) and 1 jungle gym play area.  That's it.  That's it, folks.  Oh, and there's a rock climbing wall.    I purchased a groupon for $20 for 10 visits.  I think it was $20.  My 5YO loved it there and after 2.5 hours he still didn't want to leave.  So as long as he enjoyed it, that's all that matters to me."}
