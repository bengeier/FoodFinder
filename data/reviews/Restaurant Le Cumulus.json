{"text":"This is a great place to go for a big family meal. I've gone twice, at lunch on the weekends, and it has been perfect for what we're looking for.  It's convenient for people driving in from all over, has lots of space, and isn't crowded at lunch.  The food is good and there's something for everyone.  One star off because I find it a touch too pricey for what it is, but otherwise this place is great."}
{"text":"Terrible place. They try to make EVERYTHING... And they do... Just poorly. This is some kind of Cheesecake Factory rip off. 

The menu have 77 pages. Seriously, after page 10 I'm done. I'm ready to walk out the door. You can't make everything good. You just can't. 

If you're at 10/30 try something else. 

PS: avowing their Press Cafe."}
{"text":"Un large choix de cuisines, chacun y trouve son goût du jour. Très bien en famille, une diversité de cuisine maîtrisée et appréciée.
Les plats sont frais, très bien préparés, mentions spéciales pour les lasagnes, le pouding chômeur, la soupe gratinée à l'oignon. Un adresse recommandée sur la place, cela change des chaînes traditionnelles.
A noter, un service très rapide."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience at this restaurant from food to service. From entree to dessert, no one was disappointed with their meal."}
