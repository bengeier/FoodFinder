{"text":"My dad bought a lot of rice when they went on sale, after a couple months, two of the bags have mold so we took them to return, they didn't even give us the return and also blame it on us. 
Don't ever shop at that supermarket. 
Just in case you do, check all the expiration date because there are a lot of stuff expired. 
Careful with this store, the best thing is don't shop over there. Waste your money and time for nothing."}
{"text":"Decent little grocery but the meat section is disgusting. Was in there today and and all the chicken products looked dried out and very not fresh! :( I am sick of Asian grocers lacking in cleanliness and quality. Get with it! I only frequent this place for their Filipino offerings. They need to get the ube ice cream back in stock."}
{"text":"i love it great Costumer  service   a very enjoyable experience when i get a chance to go i have nothing bad to say about this store"}
{"text":"I had a very good experience yesterday at this store. They have all the isles clearly marked which was so helpful since I am just learning to cook global cuisine. Their produce was wonderful. 
The staff was so helpful and friendly. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place for a couple of reasons. The first is proximity. I live in the north central valley, and this is one of two Asian markets closest to me. The second reason I like this place is because it caters more to a southeast Asian, Chinese and Vietnamese populace. For that reason alone it trumps Asiana, which to be honest is actually closer to my home.

Why is this important? Because I'm a South East Asian Chinese. (I actually hail from Singapore, if anybody is curious). So when I want to cook the food of the motherland, I'll want brands and ingredients from that culture. Asiana's products lean very strongly towards a Korean and Japanese background, with a good smattering of Indian. Yes, that is weird, don't ask me why. I think it's pure economics, there must a decent sized Indian population in the area.

But before LF opened, I've driven myself batty going to Asiana, walking the aisles forever trying to find Pho mix, or the right brand of my chinese soy sauce, or the correct brand of Thai curry paste. You think it's funny, but I swear after the first time, my patience for that #$%!@# is pretty low. When it's a weeknight and I'm craving Thai curry, the last thing I want to do is get there and realize that aw jeez, we just don't carry it. WTF. 

Never had that problem with LF. It's new, so the aisles are wide and clean. Their produce section is huge, and they have the usual well stocked butcher. I've picked up giant beef leg bones for my dog, and slabs of pork belly to make my favorite Red Cooked Pork. I'm also pretty sure LF is cheaper.

IMO, this is the better of the two Asian markets in the area. Go to this one, don't bother with Asiana."}
{"text":"Whoa - I'm impressed!

Perhaps it's a mistake on my behalf, but I did not anticipate finding a decent Asian grocery in Glendale. It's no secret that many Asians are moving into the Phoenix area, particularly to escape the high costs in California, but I'm really not used to anything being comparable to California when it comes to Asian anything. Haven't really found good pho, haven't even tried to find ramen, etc. etc.... but this store is excellent.

Anyhow, I was definitely impressed. There were things that I have trouble finding in San Diego on a regular basis that were easily found and in abundance in this store, and all my favorite Filipino brands were there. I went home with pork longganisa, pork siopao, and some Jufran... it was heavenly!

There's also a pretty decent fish selection and we took home some octopus for appetizers. Delicious. I can't wait to get some bangus on my next visit.

I can't say that it's the most comprehensive Asian grocer around - I haven't had the time to look at all of it, and I doubt I ever will! - but I'll be back when I visit my parents and need the proper ingredients for a good Asian meal.

Also: the service was pretty good, and fellow patrons were friendly! Always a bonus!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian market in the Valley. Its just the right size and the empolyees are more helpful to this white boy than at other locations. I'm always looking for some crazy ingredient (lime leaf or galanga or certain noodles or plantains or whatever).

Prices are excellent for produce. You can buy limes and garlic and squash for pennies on the dollar compared to the chain stores. You can also find some off beat beers here.

It think its just the right size too and laid out well. I can get lost for hours at Lee Lee.

Yes, it does smell like every other Asian market I've ever been to. God I hate it, but for some reason I don't think I would trust the place."}
{"text":"Their products are over priced and not handled well. My mochi ice cream were smooshed!!"}
{"text":"A new Asian market on Bell Road between 51st and 59th avenues. I found this place by accident one day and it turns out it has been here already for a few months. The word hasn't really gotten out yet so every time I've been there it has never been crowded. Lots of Vietnamese, Filipino, Indian, Chinese, and Japanese food products. A few Eastern European products in the sausage area. Good selection of fish and meats. I even found smoked turkey tail - last time I had that was at a Samoan deli in San Diego. They have a few selections of sashimi in the fish section - sort of like what 99 Ranch Market has. No real ready-to-eat offerings like Asiana has in their deli. Decent selection of fruits and vegetables. It's become my go-to place when I'm not in a mood for shopping and dealing with crowds. There's no alcohol though - docking one star for that."}
{"text":"I love the selection of asian style foods. I get a certain brand of instant coffee there I used to have to drive across town for. They have an excellent selection of produce and their rices are everything I might want at a good price. I live on the Northwest side of Phoenix near Bell Road and 29th Avenue, so I am glad they are close by."}
{"text":"Not a bad Oriental store located Glendale. The store isn't as big as Lee Lee's and also doesn't offer the same items as Lee Lee's. Some things are reasonably priced, but other items like the Filipino seasonings and frozen items are cheaper at Lee Lee's. But, we come here if we need basic things that we know they carry. It is frustrating when you buy seasonings here and you come back and they are all out. There are times that they do not re-stock the Filipino items for a couple weeks so, we end up going to the other market. The store is clean and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"LF Market is on the Northside of Bell just a few shops to the east of Kohls.  They have a huge variety of spices, sauces, marinades, noodles, snacks, and all things Asian related when it comes to food.  

The produce section is decently sized with some unique products.  The fish section is pretty small and the meat section is about average.  

If there is any kind of spice or sauce you are looking for to make an Asian dish this place is almost sure to have it.  The down side is the store smells.  There is a funky odor throughout the store.  There were also boxes on top of boxes that needed to be unpacked in several aisles.  This combined with boxes being used as aisle caps instead of shelving makes the store look very cheap.  

Another thing that needs to be corrected is the organization of products.  The same products can be found in multiple aisles.  To be specific fish sauce was EVERYWHERE.  I mean on 5 or 6 end caps, in two or three aisles, and also near the check out lane.  Pick a place and keep it all there.  If there is a special sure have an endcap but to have it in so many places was just confusing and disorganized.  

If you have been to Lee Lees then LF Market will have a similar feel but much smaller.  If you are looking to make an Asian meal this is a one stop shop.  If you are looking for a clean and organized grocery store keep looking."}
{"text":"I stopped by at this store because I needed some things and I knew they would have it. I read other reviews on another store named Lee Lee, I have never been to that store so I can't compare. I found the store pleasant and didn't at all feel overwhelmed. The veggies looked fresh and overall the store wasn't that bad. The prices I felt were ok,I can't compare to any other Asian store but I thought overall this place was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Glad to have an Asian market close to my home. I have been to many different market such as this one. This is by far one of the cleanest Asian markets that I have been to. The store settles in a nice location. I was able to find everything I wanted. Things that cannot be brought at American stores us as Walmart or Target. Will be back for my \"special Asian food and species\". ;)"}
{"text":"This is going to be my new place to get ingredients when I'm in a fix and not wanting to drive down into the valley. There are only a few places up here and some of them are a bit scary.

Inside is always clean and well organized. They go out of their way to make sure there is not a lot of crap spread all over the place like some of the other stores. Some stores (43rd and Union H) are so bad that I will no longer return and hope they quietly go out of business.

LF's has all the sauces, things in cans, bottles or tubs that I normally get at Lee Lee's or Mekong. The produce here always seems fresh and they have a nice selection as well.

Usually pick up some Chinese Celery or whatever I'm needing at the moment. They even have Curry leaves as well as several of the exotic items that you may see on the Bizarre Foods TV show.

They also have a unique butcher case with meat cuts that have not made it on my plate yet. Not sure what to do with Beef Testicals and Penis. Do you cook them in the same pan? Probably needs to be pretty spicy so that you do not get that FUNK going on?

Nice selection of stuffs without going overboard. Just remember that when you are cooking something and you are missing a key ingredient ... a poor substitution can be your worst nightmare.

Just curious ... but let me know if you have any experience cooking the Johnson parts mentioned above. SCHWING!

4 STARS"}
{"text":"The butcher at LF ROCKS! The ground pork and ground beef is superior. When I want to make bulgogi or Korean spicy pork, I go so often that the butcher knows me and anticipates what I want. I can tell the butcher, and he slices the meats to restaurant quality paper thickness. LF is clean and organized. I can find the items that I want really quickly and get out of the store. I give this asian market thumbs up for cleanliness and good customer service."}
{"text":"The store is simple and not overwhelming with Asian products. You can pick out ingredients that your missing from a dish and check out. I like the fact that it doesn't smell fishy inside. The aisle are well stock with ethnic food and good selection of frozen products."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the businesses in this part of the Valley. This large store is clean, spacious, and has a very wide variety of fresh produce, meats (including many kinds of organ meats), seafood, cooking utensils, and other items. Here you can find packaged and canned goods from several countries, including India, Africa, and the Mediterranean area. As with any big Asian food store, part of the pleasure in shopping here is discovering many items that you will not find in most food stores, big or small. The prices are good, so load up on stuff like coconut milk, curries, dried seaweed, exotic spices and seasonings, and other items for your culinary adventures."}
{"text":"The best Asian store around. Love the selection. Awesome aisle for sauces. Everything is so much cheaper and better than any other Asian store I've been."}
{"text":"My office recently relocated near this grocery store. They have live lobsters for sale; the price I saw was $10.99/lbs. Not horrible, not great but hey, finding a place with live lobsters in the Phoenix area is not too common. When you walk in to the store, go to the right to find the lobster tanks etc. They also have some other live fish too plus a good selection of other seafood. I did think it smelled fishy unlike other reviewers, but for a place with an abundance of seafood... well, umm what do you expect? It's not a bad thing so why make it sound bad - you don't walk into a butchers and complain it smells like beef right. Back to the review... many options for Asian foods. The only bit of caution in this place and others like it is to check exp. dates. I picked up several packaged food items that were already expired so I had to look around for valid dates. The girls at check out girls were friendly too. I'll be back for my lobster fix at some point."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  They have a very strong selection of foods from around the world, not just oriental food.  The shelves are heavily stocked yet well organized, not cluttered.  Service is pretty good, if you need to ask for something there's usually someone around.  Prices are decent."}
{"text":"This store is awesome! i just moved from cali and was looking for some fresh seafood and came across LF market, Wow there seafood selection would blow you away with so many variety, I thought this would only be in cali, but i guess they proved me wrong! This oriental market has  fresh produce from all over the world like  rambutan to Dragon fruit and things that i have never seen before in my life. which is AWESOME!! I would highly recommend anyone to come and check it out."}
{"text":"I had to return the Fish I purchased for dinner just a few hours ago because it smelled bad. I was not able to smell bad fish over the counter. This place still smells clean. This is the second spoiled fish purchase for me from here. The manager said yes that fish smells so the fish monger knowingly gave me bad fish.

 I will still stop in for produce or dry goods because I like them here but I can no longer trust them for fish."}
{"text":"I like that I can come here and find item you'll not find in the average grocery store. It brings back good memories of our travels abroad. 
From Kimchi, Fish and Shrimp paste. Cuttlefish to Squid, all kinds of fresh fruits and vegetables. 

LF oriental market has a variety of different items from Chinese, Philippines, Thailand, Laos, Vietnamese, South America, Burmese, Indian, Jamaican, Cambodian and African. ... Not the best Asian market that I've ever been to but it's convenient. 
Check this place out next time you looking to eat something different.

{"text":"Cleanest and best Asian Market in the Valley. I've been each and one of the them. You can't compare it to any Asian/Filipino Market(Seafood Market) in California but seriously this is the only choice I have in Phoenix. LeeLee's sucks. A lot of empty aisle and smells funky. Although most of the Asian Markets are because of the seafood, but atleast LF Market keep it low, lol."}
{"text":"I like Lee Lee's. To me, this place is like Lee Lee's, but closer to my house."}
{"text":"I was very happy to find this market so close to my place. It has more to offer in Japanese fare than Mitsuwa did back in Illinois, sans the sushi and food court. 

Of course, as people have mentioned in previous reviews, there is that distinct Asian market smell inside. I can get past it after a couple of minutes, but I don't think non-Asian shoppers could.

The aisle signs weren't clear; the aisle for condiments for example was a candy/sweets aisle, and the condiments were actually in the next aisle over.
A lot of goods were kept in their shipping boxes instead of properly placed on shelves. Frozen items weren't properly lined up. I would find that acceptable in a small strip mall store, but not in such a spacious place like this.

I was ecstatic when I found Filipino products like hot dogs, siopao, egg roll wrappers, polvoron, etc. So I loaded up on those. The sales are decent, but the regular price on some things were over the top. $7.99 for a small bottle of Kewpie mayonnaise is ridiculous.

The cashier didn't appear too enthusiastic about her job and didn't say a word to me when ringing up my purchase. She also didn't say anything to the customer before me who disputed a price on something--she mumbled into a walkie talkie and continued to ring items up. 

All in all, I don't like the lackadaisical appearance and attitude of the workers, but I will be back here for more Filipino groceries."}
{"text":"Not the best Asian style market around but it does have a nice selection of fish and meat. Produce section is a little small, but I am also not sure what kind of business volumes they do. It is more than adequate so I don't need to drive to Mesa."}
{"text":"For the most Variety of Oriental/Asian/Filipino Groceries LF Market Oriental and Seafood is one of the best in Arizona,  fresh, seafood, Fresh Produce,  you'll be amazed to find some Tropical Fruits you won't find anywhere else,  Like Mangosteen (you can only buy the liquid form coming from overseas,  but at LF's Market, you will find that and more,  Plus Mr Phu and And Mr Michael (General Managers) are the friendliest and willing to go above and beyond to help you,  they get 5 well deserved Stars,  Keep up the Good Work,  Lam's Family."}
{"text":"Gotta downgrade my rating slightly. The prices have risen on their seafood, meat and produce and the store has become even more disorganized. They don't stock Ting! anymore, either. I find myself down at Lee Lee more than LF nowadays, even though LF is 5 mins from my house."}
{"text":"I've stopped by here a few times and like the fact that it's cleaner than most asian market but that's probably because it's still new. Their produce selection was ok, the snack aisle was excellent, the market felt a bit cramped, and they have no live seafood. However, the thing that really got me hooked was their sashimi. I LOVE their salmon sashimi! Surprisingly fresh and better than most sushi restaurant I tried in AZ, and I've tried a lot. Plus it's so cheap! I think I bought that for dinner 3-4 times in the last 3 weeks. 

Before this place, I go to Lee Lee's  (don't like Asiana even though it's so much closer) for my groceries. LF is a little pricier than Lee Lee's but I find myself driving here more often since Lee Lee's is 7-10 min farther. If sashimi and distance aren't factors, Lee Lee is a better market to shop at with live seafood and bigger produce selection. Still, I don't have a lot to complain about this place."}
{"text":"The way they have everything lay out is kinda confusing. They will have a whole row of chips and snack down one lane. Some more in a totally different lane that's label something different. Not the most organized but they have a lot of different type of fruits and Asian food, that you won't find at your local Walmart Frys or Safeway. Staff is not very helpful but very nice."}
{"text":"I expected much more being a brand new store. 

All of the previous reviews were surprisingly good, but I doubt they shop at Asian store every week to know the small differences. It may not smell *yet*, because it just opened, but I saw a lot of fly in the store, and meats/ vegetables did not look \"amazingly fresh\". (I noticed brown spots on meat)

Their price weren't impressive either. Everything I saw today was more expensive (compare to what I usually purchase from other stores). Also thought their aisles were unorganized. It just seemed like everything was scattered everywhere. 

We'll see how they keep up."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Lee Lee's is king of the Valley Oriental markets.  That said, LF's is my 1B.  LF's has a nice selection of produce, seafood/fish, beverages, and everything else you can think of that an Oriental market would offer.  The prices I find are competitive, and overall appearance very clean.  Competition is a good thing and LF's is a winner."}
{"text":"This market is close to where I work so  it is very convenient for me unlike Lee-Lee's.  The market is smaller than Lee-Lee's but it is easy to get around.  The prices are somewhat close to the other asian markets and the selection is great.  The only thing that i didnt like about this place is that when i asked the butcher to slice my pork butt to about the same thickness as the pork chops that they sell, the guy tells me he can't do it.  Or should I say, he wouldnt do it b/c he's being lazy perhaps?  When you go to Lee'Lee's you can have anything you want cut, sliceed, chopped etc. and even though Lee Lee's is far from where I am it sure is better service and nicer people."}
{"text":"As we were new to the area and just really passing through, as we live in the SE Valley, I saw this place and made a note to come back later in the day.  One of the things of going into an Asian market is the smell of fish, seafood, and other meats, which I don't like.  LF didn't have any smell that was strong as the other markets we've been to that are Asian.  A huge plus.

I would give this store a 5 star, but their produce section is a bit limited and doesn't have the variety as Mekong.  However, it's really more like 4.5 stars for this store because things aren't overcrowded.  

LF is more of like a Safeway in the Asian markets where things are reasonably priced with plenty of room and space to maneuver your carts (unlike Mekong that stuffs their aisles), a variety of prices for the same item rather than all the same price as in Lee Lee's.  

Every person I needed help from at LF was super friendly and Asian, treated me well and with respect.  The owner of Lee Lee's is always nice to me, but not usually his employees.  At LF's, every employee was courteous and polite and I almost thought I was in a white store.

We weren't planning on buying anything, but I ended up getting several bags of stuff that were reasonably priced.  Too bad this store is over 50 miles from my house, but they would probably get my business because of the cleanliness and great customer service they have over the Asian stores I do go to."}
{"text":"LF oriental market has a variety of different items from Chinese, Philippines, Thailand, Laos, Vietnamese, South America, Burmese, Indian, Jamaican, Cambodian and African. I particularly went here for my \"Alhoa\" island fruit drink (island blues and I have become addicted to the cane sugar). LF had at least 6 of the different Aloha flavors. They actually had more flavors then most of the local hawaiian shops we went to when we were on the island. 

I picked up some fresh mango that was so delicous. They also had some fresh bamboo sticks on sale for $1.99. Pricing all around is pretty reasonable and they have a wide selection of items."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to find your Asian ingredients at an affordable price, this may NOT be the best option for you.  A lot of items are ridiculously overpriced and can be found at another supermarket for a better price (including WinCo and Fry's).  For example Garlic Chili Sauce here is ~$3.49 here vs. ~$1.50 at WinCo. You would think Asian ingredients at an Asian market would be more affordable. Also, some items are bought from another area (ie California) and are re-sold here at a different price. Really not a problem for me since I would gladly take Vietnamese food/ingredients from Little Saigon in Orange County. HOWEVER, it does become a problem when the old price is listed on the item, which can be confusing since you're not sure what the true price actually is.

If you're in a pinch and need something in the area, LF is a good option. However, if you can find it elsewhere I would suggest doing so."}
{"text":"I have gone to this market a few times now and even though it's nice to have another Asian market besides Lee Lees this one disappoints. 

If your looking for your ingredient etc of course it's here however it's not the cleanest or most sanitary place to buy everything. 

Some of the freezers have mold, and the everything  just looks uncared for. I would only purchase your seasoning or dry goods he"}
{"text":"LF Asian Market is located in the same shopping center where Kohl's is located. It is a lot smaller than Lee Lee's, but I like that it isn't too massive. They have a great selection of products and is easy to find (if you know what you are looking for). It was very clean too! Prices are very reasonable. The cashier spoke English and was very friendly. My favorite Asian grocery store!"}
{"text":"Fish was good. I moved here from central Wisconsin and it was a delight to see so many fish varieties. Vegetables were good too. If you want what you want, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"There aren't many Asian/Oriental markets in the area and had to check this one out!

LF is a decently sized market that carries a variety of Asian foods i.e. Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino and Vietnamese. One thing that I noticed was how clean the market was, it also didn't smell too bad either. They have a big variety of fresh produce, meat section was questionable but their fish looked pretty fresh to me. They also have a good majority dedicated to frozen products that are hard to come by.

In comparison to Lee Lee; LF is slightly smaller, carries less items, doesn't seem too busy but it' the next best thing on the West side. Though, I'm not complaining! I was able to walk out with food items from Vietnam, Phillipines & Japan without putting a huge dent in my wallet."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Utah, white as it is, there are still several ethnic markets, though most are hole-in-the-wall establishments.  Quaint, small and cozy.  LF Market is _not_ one of those places.  Man, this store seems to have EVERYTHING...and it can be overwhelming.

The organization of the store is interesting, and I think I've figured it out.  It seems most items are sorted by origin/audience; this is, Filipino products are on an aisle, and Vietnamese are on another.  To some extent things are organized by item, such as sauces and produce.  Still, this pattern leads to some odd placements.  For example. you can find duplicate spices for different prices on neighboring aisles.  I found this to be the case with pepper and another spice that I can't presently recall...maybe cumin?  I also had a helluva time finding peanut oil.  I looked and looked and looked.  And then the cashier (more on this in a moment) looked and looked.  And then someone else looked and looked and found something I didn't want.  And then I stumbled across what I did want...behind an aisle end display?  It was all a lot for very little.

Back to the cashier helping me.  That was great.  But what sucks is that he was the ONLY employee I could find to ask.  No one stocking shelves.  No one wandering the aisles.  Not a soul.  For a large store it has often felt very empty...granted I've always been after dark.  Still, its a pain, especially with their quirky design, to find what one is looking for.  I'm getting better though.  And, so far, this is the best I've found.  Though they, too, don't stock the thick wheat noodles we like. Sad face.

Prices are fair.  Almost forgot about that.

All said, we'll be back.  And maybe someday I'll have more to add here."}
{"text":"Not the best Asian market that I've ever been to but it's convenient. Honestly, while I was looking through the fresh produce section, you can see the shelves they sit on. It is so filthy back there. I'm just wondering when was the last time that area has been clean? & to think that this area is so filthy, how clean could the meat department be? I definitely wouldn't trust any of their fresh produce or meat here at all by the look of the conditions the food is stored in. 

The only stuff this place is actually good for & that I could trust are the product in their Dry aisles. They carry certain products here that I can NOT find available at other Asian markets."}
{"text":"This place carries all of my Asian goodies at such a great price. I do wish it was closer to me but I can't knock stars off for that."}
{"text":"a great place to spend some time educating yourself about foods a world away...very authentic.
they carry pork belly...a must eat pork product...take the time to learn the right way to cook it.
i love the sauce ilse. i could spend years trying them all."}
{"text":"Its not bad here, nothing like the 99 ranch, Mitsuya and other Asian markets back home in Cali, but it gets the job done. I mainly come here for my aloe vera drinks, Shin Ramyun noodles and random Asian snacks (dried seaweed, calpico, etc.). But my Viet roommate made Bun Rieu the other night and was able to find everything she needed here. Selection is not as good as Asiana or Lee Lees as someone else pointed out but I think they are trying to get a feel for what the public wants.

I LOLed at all the comments about \"fishy smells\" I didn't realize that that was even a big deal for people. It ain't a good Asian market if it doesn't smell like fish is what I say! That probably means that they don't carry/clean/fry fish in house . Bummer. Maybe the proprietors of Asian markets fail in Arizona because the locals fear fishy smells haha. And it would be nice if someones sole purpose was to give samples of  yummy Asian food and teach customers how to cook... but last time I checked, Fry's wasn't cooking up a Thanksgiving meal to those who don't know how to cook a traditional Thanksgiving dinner! That's what the internet is for! The exception may be Costco :P

But I digress. I support local businesses. Especially ethnic ones since the Peoria/Glendale area is seriously lacking some culture/good food. Check it out, I promise it doesn't smell."}
{"text":"Love a good Asian market! I came here to get some curry paste and left with an armful of goodies! I didn't visit their fresh food sections, so no comment there, but they had a great variety of spices, curry pastes, sauces, noodles, and general non perishables. If I were in the West valley, I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Meh..I wanted to like this place and give this place a chance because I had never been there and it was a tad bit closer than my usual store which is lee lees but this store was smaller,more expensive,and some of the frozen meats didn't look that fresh..i guess i'll go the extra distance and stick with lee lees"}
{"text":"First time to an Asian market. Needed items for sushi, fresh spring rolls, boba tea & moon swirl taro filled pastries. Happy to find everything I needed. The check out clerks were really nice.
Place was a tad smelly-but their seafood seems pretty dang fresh! Lol

Also I couldn't get down some isle with my cart because of employees stocking shelves.

Overall, I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"I frequently shop at Asiana on 43rd & Union Hills, so I was glad to see a new Asian market opening in the neighborhood. I stopped in a few weeks back and was not disappointed. The obvious standout here is the seafood counter. The entire store is impeccably clean but the seafood counter is immaculate. They carry a large variety of seafood and all of it appeared quite fresh. No odd fishy odors, which is always a good sign.

The store is smaller than Asiana, so they don't carry quite as large a variety of products. In particular they don't have an abundance of Indian products, but they do carry Gup Shup peanuts so that's enough right there to keep me coming back...oh, and the ice. A 20 pound bag of ice is always a must in my house (even if it is Reddy ice - Boo!).

A great produce section too, with all the items that a good Asian market should have and more. It's good to see a little competition in the neighborhood, and it appears to be working. Asiana's prices seem to have come down a little and it looks like they're trying to clean up their store a bit as well - hooray me!"}
{"text":"good place to shop for veggies, seafood and other asian food products. you have the option to have the staff clean, cut, or fry the fish you'd like to buy. staff are helpful."}
