{"text":"The worst experience ever. Been there before and the place was ok. But last night just did it for me and my family to never return. One the salad bar was worst than other days. Normally we have to pick thru all the bad lettuce, but rhis time the lettuce was worst. About 80% of the condiments on the salad bar were all gone and what was there was full of water from the condensation. I asked the manager if she was going to refill the condiments and said yes and starting refilling everything without first removing all the old watered down condiment containers. So our salads were all watered down from the water. The potato salad was so watered down it poured like soup. So after paying close to $100 for dinner which included 2 large pizzas, 4 salads  4 drinks. We tried to go back for more salad after we got to the bottom of our salads and saw all the water. When we asked for a new plate we were told the salad bar is no longer all you can eat. Never was this told to us at the time of purchase. So after getting really upset i asked the manager for a corporate number to file a complaint. Her answer was I can give you the number but nobody will see it because the complaint will jisy be forwarded to our store. At that point I said I no longer wish to dine there and asked for a refund. The pizza came and my family started eating. So i walked over and told them to stop eating because we were leaving. The manager said she spoke to someone above her and was told to only refund the salads. I did not accept and i told her i wanted a full refund and was willing to pay for the 4 slices my family ate. So after arguing back and forth she charged me about $8 for the 4 slices and was going to refund me the rest to my card. PETER PIPER PIZZA was a way better choice for dinner last night. Even saved me about $30. Oh and by the way there were only about 5 groups at Chuck e cheese and i saw at least 4 workers including the manager and not one could keep the salad bar stocked."}
{"text":"So we LOVE Chuck E Cheese. Have had many birthday parties over the last 10 years. Our usual location on Alma School in Mesa has really declined, and we recently moved closer to this one.   Service is bad. I have been here on 3 occasions. There is only 1 person on front counter duty, often also running the door. With a line of 4 families waiting, 2 employees are standing at front counter talking while 1 person tries to take orders. And this one person isn't even qualified, has to keep running into the back to ask questions. I'm assuming the manager is in the back instead of supporting her crew when it's slammed. One dude in a black polo just wanders around aimlessly.  As some trained and experienced in food service management, it's appalling."}
{"text":"Amazing when it was open. I felt like I was walking in to the closed CEC store in Scottsdale. But as of 10/9/15 it closed down."}
{"text":"This is still one of the better CEC in the valley.   My little cutie pie wanted to have his birthday bash here...hopefully the last time.  \"I promise to have my next birthday somewhere else next year.\"  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  He absolutely loves the Ticket Blaster, only reserved for the birthday kid.  They should never do away with this, it may be the only thing they've got going!  The pizza was not bad and party platters were decent.  All in all, the kiddos had a fun time, that's all that really mattered."}
{"text":"This Chuck E. Cheese is not as big as some so don't expect the stage and a big performance. The pizza was decent and the servers were very nice and accommodating to our little one. It was clean all EXCEPT for the climbing tubes which smelled and had trash in them. I'm sure they're not easy to clean but this must be done!   When it's all said and done the kids love this place and it's an inexpensive place to celebrate a birthday.  They provide the food and fun and clean up the mess when you leave."}
{"text":"Management needs to wake up.  This location is full of lazy, slovenly, disinterested and unhappy looking employees.  Bathrooms need more regular maintenance as do all of the games.  Just about every game has something wrong with it.  Instead of fixing the game when I reported a problem, they just gave me a coin.  No apology and no effort to put a sign on the machine or fix it was made on any of my visits here.  You can spend $50 playing games here and not earn enough to buy anything worthwhile at the prize counter.  This place is a racket!    Salad bar is neglected, but surprisingly the pizza service has been OK the last few times I've been here.  To put that in context, the pizza is of course not good, but at least it was hot and edible.  2 stars is generous and I only give it that because at least the kids have been happy.  Get a competent manager who cares and this location can be decent."}
{"text":"Either I'm growing up or the games aren't what they use to be.  I believe the latter as I really haven't grown up that much.  For one, most of the video games have been replaced by small mechanical rides.  The rides seem really lame, but my daughter has a compulsive need to try each one.  Most of the non-ride token consuming devices spit out limited amounts of tickets unless faced with an extreme display of skill or the slightest bit of luck.  Many of the ticket games are kiss your token good-bye in two seconds or less and see what happens.  Otherwise, there were some mediocre racing games.  I conducted a thorough search of the premises.  The ball pit has shrunk, but with an increase in the second floor tunnel system.  The decor now includes Chuck E Cheese parities of TV shows and movies like The C Files, Chuckfeld, and Chuck Trek that are amusing.  My daughter loves the blue screen where her image appears on some screens in the dining area in front of whatever is playing.  As with most times we come, we came for a birthday.  The Chuck E Cheese balloon that greets you at the table is really cool.  It's fun to watch the little ones try and grasp tickets in the wind tube, a must see.  And the pizza is pizza.  The caffeinated apple soda was interesting.  After realizing there was no coke, I had root beer.  All in all, the location is small and needs better video games, but is fun for the kids.  Too bad they don't Yelp."}
{"text":"i had not been inside a Chuck E Cheese for evvverrr until just a few days ago and geez it sure has changed since i was a kid!  Kids go bonkers in this place and they do a really good job of making the kids feel special and all that jazz. They have the table sections for each party and do a group birthday celebration when chuck e comes out. The birthday kids also get to go into a wind blower and try to catch a bunch of tickets.. my friends son got the $1000 ticket (only one in there) and he freaked out haha! Good place for the young kids for sure and a decently priced place to throw a bday bash so you don't break the bank."}
{"text":"While I absolutely hate going here, it's dirty, noisy and full of kids, my sweet pea loves it so we had his last two birthday parties here.  They took good care of us and were in charge so I didn't have to heard kids around.  I just wish the place weren't so dirty."}
{"text":"Why on earth would anyone come to this location?    I don't know where to begin with my issues with this establishment.  From the salad bar that needed maintenance to the restrooms.  This is a place with kids, most of the them under the age of 12, the bathrooms need to have a regular schedule for cleaning and restocking, especially on the weekends!  Kids in general are messy, but now you have a couple hundred running through a restroom, it needs to be cleaned regularly.  I was so disappointed to see that the staff only appeared for the birthday party and to drop off food, but when I looked around, I only saw one person out sweeping and trying to clean up and the person at the entrance.  Other than that, I would occasionally see a person come from the back and look around and go back to the back..  You have kids running around wildly.  Everyone at work that's not cooking should be out trying to man the restaurant floor.    Hand sanitizers ran out in the play area, but people working there were waking around doing nothing.  I will return if a kid I know is having a party there, but I won't be eating the food."}
