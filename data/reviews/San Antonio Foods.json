{"text":"Home made Italian food. Great /fast service, great portions for the price!! Amazing. Done and done!!"}
{"text":"I wandered in here for a quick lunch one day while volunteering nearby and was happy to see that the menu had multiple vegetarian options. I got the spicy veggie sandwich (to go) which is roasted veggies on a really nice bun. It was a good size and nice and warm and really hit the spot (I was also super hungry that day). The staff was really nice and helped me navigate their menus and gave me tips on what to order (in terms of spiciness etc.). The wait was not long at all and they churned out multiple orders real quick while I waited for my own.  Price was also very reasonable.   Would definitely venture back here to try pasta dishes and pizza!"}
{"text":"Love the veal sandwich! Better than San Francisco or California!!!! Also better that Ninos. The sauce is perfect!!"}
{"text":"Great fresh seafood & amazing quality.  Paul and the entire family at San Antonio treat you like part of their extended family. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food from real Italians! The pizza is among the best we've ever had. I don't know whether they use a different kind of cheese, or it's just how everything is proportioned, but it's perfect. Of course, the delicious sauce goes a long way toward making that the case.  Their famous \"veal ideal\" sandwich is a favorite of my wife's and my uncle's. I like it, but think it can use more of their amazing sauce on it.  Also worth having is the panzeroti and if you're so inclined, the tripe. If you don't know what it is, don't ask. Note that the tripe, while amazing, is priced a little too high IMHO."}
{"text":"The sure know how to make pizza! Everything about it was just perfect: crispy thin crust, lots of cheese and delicious tomato sauce. Their olives were very good as well. Loved the place and will certainly come back!"}
{"text":"In my quest to find the best steak sandwich in Toronto, I still haven't found any place better than Vicentini Meats on Edilcan (Jane north of Langstaff). At the suggestion of a friend, I gave San Antonio Foods a try. It is located in the same plaza at Texas Pit on Hwy 7, east of Martingrove.  The steak sandwich is ok, however it tastes like a veal sandwich and that's the issue I have with a lot of Italian sandwich shops. Loaded with onions, mushrooms and cheese the topping overpower the taste of the steak. And at $15 with a soft drink, it is quite expensive. If I'm craving steak in a bun or a wrap, my two favorite places close by are Osteria Berto and Vicentini Meats. Both have steak wraps and sandwiches that are far better at the same or lower prices.  I assume that other Italian favorites such as veal, pizza and pasta are largely pretty good, with the emphasis being on \"largely\". The sandwiches are big however I wouldn't give up taste for quantity. The veal sandwiches look like California Sandwiches and that may be because the owners have some relationship to the original location.   So for pizza, pasta and veal, I believe that San Antonio could be a good spot, But as for the steak sandwich, I probably wouldn't order that again. Next time it will be the veal sandwich or pizza, that the other reviewers rave so much about.  The interior is old school with well used tables and walls painted with scenic pictures of the old country. The service is good and they seem to be friendly, even to newbies."}
{"text":"From what I've been told this place is owned by the same family who originally owned the famous San Francisco sandwiches on Clinton. They do all the Italian hot table classics, but with their own signature twists. The veal sandwich has the ultra thin slices of crispy, greasy veal that goes down really easy. Their pizzas are tasty, and I love when you get a place with pepperoni that curls up into little grease bowls. You can't forget your veggies, so make sure you pair all that with a side of fragrant and aromatic tomato salad. Old school benchmark."}
{"text":"Really good veal sandwiches and steak sandwiches.  Better for takeout or a quick bite."}
