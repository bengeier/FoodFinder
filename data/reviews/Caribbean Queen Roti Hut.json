{"text":"Great food. The price is okay. The curry was delicious! And that damn jerk chicken. Too bad they run out. Get there at noon for a great lunch to go!"}
{"text":"This place looks like a hole in the wall on the outside, but the food is amazing! Super flavourful and authentic; huge portions and super cheap! So glad to find a simple place to get great West Indian food from! Service isn't the greatest but the food is sooooo worth it! Will be returning when I need my curry fix!  I had the Boneless chicken curry Roti; my best friends mom is from Trini and she makes the best homemade chicken curry and Roti, and this tastes identical to her food, brought back great memories!  My boyfriend had the jerk chicken and said its the best jerk chicken he's ever had. I'm not a fan of jerk chicken and I thought his was delicious!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the restaurant, but ordered delivery 2 times and the food was great.  The roti's both times we had to add a bit of salt to them, but other than that it was delicious.  Doubles, Aloo pie, Pholori balls, all good and huge portions. Thank you!"}
{"text":"To me, this place is A-OK, but alas, that's it. I really had a hankering for some jerk but it was crappy weather and Mitzie's was just a little too far to go. So I came to Yelp and this place seemed to have the highest ratings in the immediate vicinity.  Since it was my first visit, I wanted to sample various menu items so I ordered a boneless chicken roti, a jerk chicken dinner with rice n' peas and a double. I also asked for extra hot sauce. All of this was to-go.  The food was prepared and my wait was not long. The gentleman who served me was pleasant and conversational. The restaurant is extremely old school with affixed stools running all the way down a long bar. What appeared to be an early 90's episode of Jerry Springer played on the mounted television. It was about a woman who cheated on her girlfriend with a guy. Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!  My bag came and the three items came to $23. (The prices of most menu items just went up $1.00 and they haven't yet printed the new menus). It weighed about 8 pounds.  When I got home, I was eager to try everything. My thoughts:  The Jerk chicken was two full legs, broken down to the drums and thighs. They were served over the rice n' peas which had a light topping of brown gravy. There was also a garden salad in the corner simply drenched in what appeared to be ranch dressing. It was a pile of mush by the time I got home due to its proximity to the hot food. It went into the trash. The jerk was obviously oven roasted. It had no bark whatsoever. It almost seemed stewed to a degree. It was somewhat tasty with a nice hit of heat. It did, however, seem to have hints of East Indian flavours (I believe the owners are East, not West Indian). The hot sauce too had East Indian flavours, quite sweet and sour, not reminscent of Scotch Bonnet flavoured sauces I'm used to at other Caribbean spots.  The roti was simply massive. Bigger than any other I have ever had. Perhaps twice the size of most places, BUT... The roti wrap itself was folded over on itself at least three times. There was so much of it. It was, however, supple and flavourful. The innards were less spicy and less flavourful than the jerk and was comprised mostly of potato.  The double was my favourite of all the items. The chana within had a gentle curry flavour and was quite spicy. The bread was wonderfully chewy, a textural treat with the mushy garbanzos inside.  On my way to Caribbean Queen, I noticed two other Caribbean establishments I have never seen before. Neither of them appeared in my prior Yelp search. When I looked them up on Yelp, they both were actually here but under \"Imported Food\"! Duh? That doesn't help when searching for a restaurant. Get your cuisine types right when adding businesses folks! Anyways, I've changed them both and hopefully they will now appear under restaurants.  I look forward to trying these other two places in hopes that I will find a hidden gem closer to home than Mitzie's. I will not be back to Caribbean Queen. Not because it was bad but because there are many other options and I know there's better food out there."}
{"text":"Oh Mimico - I just want to hate you so much but you consistently lure me back! Okay if it wasn't for my Mom living there lets be honest - we wouldn't be friends.  We were on our way to the usual Thai place for lunch when my Mom threw me the \"Want Roti instead?\" loop that I pretty much jumped at.   All in all Caribbean Queen looks like a divey diner with booths that are really only supposed to hold people that are 120lbs or less. Seriously I felt like a fat man in a little coat sitting in that thing. The place is run by one woman who does it all - waitress, host, cook and mom (since it seemed by the early afternoon her place was crawling with her kids and her kids friends).   I ordered the boneless curry chicken roti and a couple of doubles for the hubs for dinner (since the dim sum debacle hes such a whining baby!). My roti was pretty tasty and for ONCE my boneless chicken actually had NO bones, and a decent amount of meat! For only $7 I was really surprised at how much filling there was.   So all in all despite the ambiance and the fact that since it was a one woman show, getting service was difficult to say the least, I would totally come back to order take out, cause there's no way I'm fitting in that booth again."}
{"text":"We ordered Jerk Chicken and Stew Chicken rice dishes as take-out and got it delivered by Skip The Dishes. The food came promptly and was still warm. The portions were extremely generous (we food coma afterward). Both the chicken dishes and the rice and peas were extremely delicious. I found the stew chicken to have the most exceptionally done - the flavour was great. Would order from them again."}
{"text":"The portions are big and great tasting!! The best Caribbean restaurant in Etobicoke!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This food was waaaay to salty. Not in taste, taste was decent. A little dry. But the next couple days.... you'll need gallons of water to combat the excessive sodium levels in your body. Not worth it"}
{"text":"Portions are enough for dinner and lunch the next day. The curry goat is my absolute favourite - the doubles are a close second. I have the food often as it is very hearty food and at great prices! Run by a very friendly family as well."}
{"text":"The food was okay - large portions, affordable and tasted fine. The service was subpar. Based on the previous reviews, my friend and I expected more."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick snap because I was in the area. Old school tavern atmosphere turning out some very tasty Trini treats. The doubles are spot-on, and the fluffy, savoury parathas really hit the spot. The boneless chicken roti is big winner, and ordering it extra spicy is a must if you're as serious about your pepper sauce as I am."}
{"text":"I think my review is more so closer to the 3.5. Not because of the food but tge atmosphere but then again I'm not a regular so really i dont get a say. The place is extremely old, here is a karaoke dive bar next door so often those smelly day drinkers are in this establishment as well. When we walked in the table we sat at smelled a bit like old urine. Yup, quite qross. But the bf was hungry and we trust oir fellow Yelpers. While we read over the menu a man walks in slaps 5$ on the bar and asks for \"a cold brewsky w no questions asked\". Lol he was def a reg and gave high praises. But the  again he looked like the type of dude that drank beer and smoked cig for dinner.  Anywho, we ordered a small chicken soup, a large curry chicken roti(comes boneless) and 2 doubles to go.  They are very friendly and are from Trinidad. The food was ready in about 15 mins and came out pipping hot. The Roti was huge, alot of just the shell wrapped over a few times. But the ratio to meat was quite substantial. I would recommend more gravy though as you need something to combat the mouth full of carbs. The doubles were perfect even after having to microwave it was still tasty. The consistency of the dough and the sweetness of the chutney was just perfect. Spice on the side as always so you can adjust to your liking. I hvent had time to try the soup yet but will update once i do."}
{"text":"I grew up having roti's as a child and this was the best I've had in years since my favourite downtown spots closed down. Way better than what I've had in little Jamaica too. It is mimico but I'll travel from Leslieville for this or get off the gardiner on my way west for the boneless curry chicken roti for sure. I asked for it spicy and still needed hot sauce which was killer-- but I love heat. It was homemade I believe  Wicked For $8 and I brought home half -- a steal!"}
{"text":"Roti's were bland and lacking flavour. They probably should have used double the amount of curry as the food was severely lacking in taste. It's too bad as the prices are quite reasonable here. The quest for great West Indian roti in the west end continues until Barb's Roti reopens."}
