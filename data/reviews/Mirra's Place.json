{"text":"As a personal blogger of my eating habits It's pretty rare that I give a place 4-5 stars only because I follow the formula that every place can be improved. With that said I was extremely satisfied with my service and meal. The food was very authentic and served hot. My server or host was friendly and even gave me a free birthday desert. My meal was about $35 including my glass of pop. Music in the background was perfect although.   I would recommend for sure :)"}
{"text":"I'm seldom in the Lawrence/Dufferin area, but our work Christmas party was held here tonight (Friday) so I found myself at Mirra's.  I was late for the party and found parking to be a female dog. There's a lot on site, but there are not enough parking spaces considering... I managed to find a parking space by blocking a car from exiting. Oh well, you gotta do what you gotta do.  The service was excellent. I think it's a family business and the fam all work here. We had a set menu as there was about 40 of us eating here. The chicken was delish.  I think I might just have to come back to check the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to coming to this place, but sadly did not even get close to my expectations. Their photos made this place look great, and it had decent reviews. But...man...no. not worth it at all. Tried 5 dishes to make sure. None of them were good. I could go into more detail about why for each one but it would take me too long. Maybe I'll update this post in the future to explain. In the mean time just take my word for it. Good points are the staff were nice and very helpful that's why I gave it 2 points."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian food, one of the few in the city where you can get real homemade food.  Caesar salad is made from scratch, zuppa di pesce is so amazing you can lick the bowl.   Great ambience, feels like you stepped back in time to an old-school Italian restaurant from the 70s."}
