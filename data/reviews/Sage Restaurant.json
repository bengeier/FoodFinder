{"text":"We had a late lunch here after the Jameson Experience. I had the #12 mile Share board (for 1) which had ham, goat cheese, another cheese, smoked salmon, small salad, black pudding, bread accompanied with honey and a bit of oil on the side. It was absolutely amazing, I wish WISH I could have waited for dinner!"}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant. The food is excellent and locally sourced. The staff is great and very friendly. I highly recommend the caramel tart dessert, it's so good!"}
{"text":"Nice,  quiet restaurant with very good food and service.  I went for an early lunch. It was quiet at first but the space quickly filled up.  We had the duck and the gnocchi. Both were perfectly cooked and flavorful.  The ambiance is very comfortable and it's a cute looking space."}
{"text":"Sadly Sage doesn't live up to their own hype. A complete waist of time and MONEY. 

We had a 5:30 pm reservation in order to beat the dinner crowd as a suggestion from the employee taking our reservation. Once seated it was quite clear that the Resturant hadn't finished setting up given the level of noise from the kitchen and the long wait for drinks. We had both decided on the Top Sirloin (medium rare) with a grilled onion and leaks & potato tart. One of the steaks was rare and the other steak was closer to charred raw (with about 25% of it being gristle and Inedible), the grilled onion was burnt and hard and the leaks and potato tart were over cooked and flavorless. All in all, I would describe the meal as a FAILURE, a shameful excuse for a dinner. At this point we both decided to bypass dessert, and politely request our bill. The bill we received had been combined with the table next to us (good thing I reviewed it!), after hunting down the waitress to have the bill amended we paid and left (without so much a apology)...........

My suggestion to this Establishment is to remove the \"grill cook\" and replace him with a \"proper chef\" who knows how to trim meets and prepare them to order. To the wait staff, I would suggest they try being a little more inviting as well as aware of the table they are serving. 

A lesson / phrase learned a long time ago \"Just because people are foolish enough to over pay doesn't make you a good Resturant\""}
