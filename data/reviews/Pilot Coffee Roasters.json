{"text":"Located conveniently in the great hall.  Great place to get coffee during the rush. Got a latte and it was delicious! It is a bit closer than Sam James for me so I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you like a very, very acidic tasting coffee, then you may like this. Much too acidic for my taste. Had to throw throw the whole cup away. Left a bad after taste too. Quick service."}
{"text":"I was always a fan of Pilot until I saw their barista overfill his portafilter and remove some of the coffee by sticking his bare fingers in and pulling the grounds out. I nearly fainted. Please, please re-train your employees on health and safety standards."}
{"text":"If you dare order an overpriced coffee at Pilot, be prepared to wait in getting it. Below average coffee, and a blueberry banana cow pat scone to keep it company.
A word to the wise...go elsewhere, save your money."}
{"text":"Located in the great hall in Union Station, commuters and other frequenters of Union Station finally have a convenient option for really good coffee. The only downside is that it's more expensive than its sister location in Leslieville, Te Aro."}
{"text":"The coffee here is quite good. After three hours, I still found myself sipping on my cold coffee instead of tossing it out as it's very full bodied and tasty! Even after adding a lot of milk I can still taste the coffee, mmm. There's little acidity and I normally don't love coffee (or I just go to McDs).

I also had a chai latte here. Tastes \"in-house\", i.e. not the gross syrupy kind, and I just had it \"as is\". Whether they make it from scratch, who knows. Their mocha though - OMG...it's like a latte with a mild cocoa taste, tastes almost like the nutella latte I've come to love so much at Black Canary. It's OMG-good. 

There's also a small selection of food here. I had a blueberry scone and it tastes much like the scones you get at other (good) coffee shops. Tasted fresh and yummy enough! The sea salt chocolate chip cookie was to die for though, and was nice and chewy too. Overall though for food there is not a huge selection so if you're looking for breakfast you might want to hit up York Concourse instead. 

One wish: that the cups here were a little bigger, but given the location, quality, and decent service... this is a keeper."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place considering the reviews and marketing which suggests a connoisseur level product. The coffee does meet expectations, it's full bodied with sufficient crema. Unfortunately, like a lot of coffee places in North America, the macchiato has too much milk which ultimately overwhelms the coffee itself."}
{"text":"Incredibly amazing vanilla almond milk latte! Cool vibe and the Gluten Free Rosemary Orange Muffin was DIVINE!"}
{"text":"My absolute coffee roaster in Toronto. Great quality coffee beans. I used to drive to Pilot coffee's roastery in the Riverdale area to purchase their beans. I am go glad that they have since then opened up a few stores in the downtown core, so I could buy beans straight from the stores instead."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by one morning before work. There was no line at all and the staff are super friendly. 

I ordered a small coffee which came out to $2.50. I thought the coffee was very smooth and not overpowering like how Starbucks coffee can be. Location is very convenient for those commuters who pass by union station but may be a little pricey to go regularly! 

I will definitely return to try other drinks on their small selected menu in the future."}
{"text":"New location in Union Station (street level right by Front street entrance). 

It looks like a permanent food stall... There is no seating etc. 

Cappuccino ($3.5) was decent. It did taste a little weaker than what I'm used to though. 

Even though this is closer to my office, I'll stick with Sam James coffee bar"}
{"text":"Hidden in the labyrinth that is Union station, this quick grab n' go coffee shop really bring a little bit of sunshine to your day. They roast their own beans and the level of quality definitely reflects in the products they serve. I ordered a cappuccino and was pleasantly surprised.

The coffee was bliss. Rich and full bodied. I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur nor do I claim to be. I love my coffees taken like desserts- I actually prefer my caffeinated drinks to be sweeter than most desserts I enjoy. I dislike bitterness and quite a baby about it. However, this is one of the rare occasions that I was able to enjoy the cappuccino as is without added sugar. The coffee had a very pleasant taste and the expected bitterness was muted, there was a slight enjoyable aftertaste of sweet notes following each sip. The foam provided a nice yet rich mouth feel with every sip. I quite enjoy the addictive quality of the different range bitter to sweet progression. I've never had quite the experience, it was good to the very last drop. 

The price is a lot steeper, but almost expected for the area. However, in fairness the service and quality will somewhat justify the tag. I love watching the barista artfully pour out the foam art. 

Overall, I love the experience. I would go back from time to time, when I'm not too broke. Would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to experience good coffee. Their menu is not extensive but cover all the basis for drip coffee and espresso drinks-I appreciate that I didn't need to stand there and stress over too many options when I'm yet to be functional (aka uncaffeinated)."}
{"text":"Visited on 18 June 2016, after Saturday lunch.
The staffs were doing great job. The two boys were providing a great service even within a short moment of taking order and deliver the coffee.

The daily brew I got was more acidic than I expected. Perhaps should ask the staffs before place your order."}
{"text":"I wanted to try coffee that's very different from my usual purchases. I walked by Union and I saw Pilot. I heard great things about this place, so I gave them a try. I ordered a brew coffee in medium size. I should of waited before I took a sip, which is what I usually do. (Per that statement, I didn't let it sit.) Anyhow, I let it cool off and sipped it. It is very different than my usual purchases from a bigger chain. They have only 1 flavour. So there are no alternative. Back to the coffee... I like the flavour as it is not overpowering. However I noticed my first sip, the flavour was sour at first? But after I let it sit, the flavour is very acceptable. The venue is clean and well lit. As this was a take out, there's not much to comment on the venue. Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"This is some amazing coffee! I work in a cafe/ bar so I drink espresso for free all the time. But when I have to pay I'm so picky!!! I like two places in Toronto. And why I love pilot is for the coffee but also you get some great staff=service. A great cupa   
Without the attitude! You can tell these guys really care about your coffee experience!!!"}
{"text":"A really good cappuccino. Convenient and easy if you are at Union Station. Easy to miss, so be on then lookout."}
{"text":"I am very happy to welcome this new addition to Union Station. They provide exceptional service and great espresso! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not a big coffee drinker, so I won't rate the coffee itself. What I will rate is the supremely slow rate the two baristas at this location work at. I get this isn't a Starbucks, but c'mon. Rush hour is for rushing."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw this little shop in the middle of Union Station!  I fell in love with the coffee from IQ Food Co., who uses Pilot beans.  I was going to order them online but then I discovered this shop!  How perfect and convenient!!  The espresso-based drinks are delicious; not too acidic, not too strong.  The perfect balance for my taste.
Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This location has improved insurmountably in customer service, attitude, and efficiency since it first popped up at Union Station earlier last year. Note that their space is limited; it is, essentially, a food stall. There are no surrounding tables, so no spots for chit-chatting and people-watching dedicated to Pilot's space specifically. But there are available seats within the stall's vicinity that belong to Union Station, where you can enjoy your coffee, if you plan on sticking around for a bit!

I usually come by in the mornings after getting off my GO train and I go for their regular brew ($2.25 for a small, $2.50 for a medium, $3.00 for a large). 

The brew itself is consistently made of AWESOME. Really, really, good coffee. Delicious, no burnt aftertaste. Sweet yet tarte. Interesting flavour, and completely addicting. 

In short, I love the coffee here. Still deep and bold, but the flavours aren't as slap-you-in-the-face burnt-coffee-heavy as other brews. Very complex flavours, absolutely delicious. As long as this spot sticks around at Union, I'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"I really don't see how Pilot has the best roast coffee. I tried a regular brew coffee this morning with nothing added- it was incredibly acidic and watery. Unimpressed by their lack of decent brew.

I might return to try their espresso based beverages but I don't see myself coming back any time soon. Would not go out of my way to visit any of the Pilot locations."}
{"text":"Pilot is located in the Great Hall in Union Station where I pass every morning getting off the GO. Before I tried Pilot's coffee and their specialty drinks, I thought it was too pricey for just a cup of joe so I stuck with my McDonald's coffee. I decided to treat myself to one of their flat whites ($3.50) and now I can't go back. It was worth every dollar and I am sorry I compared Pilot to McDonald's. I am happy to pay a premium for Pilot coffee. 

For the flat white, great steamed milk to espresso ratio, smooth, and not overpowering in coffee taste. I can go without adding in any sugar. Best of all, it doesn't leave a sour acidic aftertaste (like Starbucks). Their brewed coffee and americano are also quite good.

Note, there is no seating. It's a standalone booth in the station. There is sometimes a line in the morning during rush hour but they have a system down. Staff is friendly and it's an open space so you could watch them do their barista magic while you wait for your drink."}
{"text":"They make an amazing Americano, I look forward to getting Pilot's every time I'm near Union station!"}
{"text":"Came here because IQ uses their coffee and pulls really nice espressos, so wanted to try the drinks from the roasters. Espressos are rich and creamy but I often get slightly sour shots not as hot as I would like. Still like the end result but with the same beans IQ makes better coffee. 

I tried their drips, the holiday blend and el cadejo. Holiday blend, you should skip. El cadejo was actually pretty nice! 

Their baked goods are alright. I tried blueberry vanilla scone and blueberry banana muffin. Ate them after few hours of buying them and they were decent. Probably was better when it was warmer. 

This is a coffee place I can't help but go especially there are not many places that do better. Def top 2 in the area."}
{"text":"Quick, excellent coffee in a busy train station. 
On top of that, friendly service! 
They even explained the \"mod bar\" (their special espresso) setup to me. Supposedly 25 across Canada... more in the US (the only other I've seen is in Hawaii)."}
{"text":"So far my favorite handcrafted coffee place!  I pass by it every morning and I could smell the coffee from far away.  It is located on the ground level of Union Station close to the exit facing Fairmont Royal York hotel. 

I always order the Soy Latte which is $4 tax included.  I've been noticing the long wait for drinks because it is getting more popular! 

However, it is sometimes difficult to know who's drink is next because it seems like 80% of the time people order the same thing.  This makes it hard to see who should pick up their drink first since there's no official \"lineup\" for pickup.  People just stand around and sometimes I just wonder if random people would walk up to grab a \"free\" drink.  

If you haven't tried it yet, you should! It's definitely better than Tims, Starbucks and McD!"}
{"text":"Delicious espresso based coffee drinks. Late and Americano have both been great during several visits.

Also offer roasted beans - the espresso blend I purchased once was tasty.

Small shop located inside the station. Friendly staff - sometimes dancing to latin music, sometimes looking somewhat hipster-ish (good/bad/doesn't matter?). 

There is also a location outside at \"Union Summer\" during the warmer months of 2016."}
{"text":"After googling the best coffees in downtown Toronto, my cousin was telling me about Pilot and how he met the owners or cofounders and how they were pretty chills and how Pilot was known for the BEST COFFEE ROAST. I had time to spare before jumping on the train up north and wanted to try this new place.

They have a cute little kiosk at Union station,  closer to Front Street. Pretty organized and the staff are nice and chatty. 

This is my second time here. The first time, I tried the Chai Latte and it was okay. I love Chai Lattes and had them better other places. This morning, I tried the Mocha and got the sea salt chocolate chip cookie. The mocha was amazing, absolutely delicious, it was wasn't too sweet and you can still taste the strong coffee. 

All of their baked goods - looked scrumptious. My sea salt chocolate chip cookie was a perfect medium between sweet, salty and crunchy yet so soft. DO TRY THE COOKIE!! I'm going to save half for my boyfriend for him to try it. It is so yummy!

The next time that I do come here, I will try their fresh roasted coffee, should have been the first thing to try before all the other drinks."}
{"text":"Great 3 wave coffee spot right in union station I went out of my way everyday I was in town to make it to pilot. The staff were very friendly and fast. I had the drip coffee and the espresso every morning both were spot on. Thanks for being apart of my AM routine while in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Tried my first Pilot cappuccino this morning and I can say it won't be my last! The taste was very smooth, the coffee was not bitter, and the wait was very reasonable for 8:15 am.  It took ~ 5 minutes from ordering to having a coffee in hand, given there were about 5 or 6 people ahead of me. 

They were very efficient and it was probably one of the top cappuccinos I have tasted in Toronto."}
{"text":"Pilot Coffee Roasters' coffee stand inside Union Station's Great Hall probably one of the best addition or one of the best changes that happened at Union Station.

I always like Pilot Coffee and this location though small but coffee is well made and with nice latte art.

I was lucky there was no line up at all when I was there and services was friendly.

Just happy to have one of our local indie coffeeshop/roastery that able to open up in one of the busiest travel hub in Toronto. Not another Starbucks or Tim Horton's! Now maybe we should have one at YYZ?"}
{"text":"Pilot is currently a large stand located on the main floor of Union Station. The lineup varies from day to day, but what's consistent is the quality of coffee that they serve. I usually order a mocha and I find it to be very light, sweet, tasty. I think the coffee is not as strong as other places I usually frequent. However, the lightness of the coffee and the flavor is what wins me over. It's currently ranked 2nd on my list of best coffee in Toronto."}
{"text":"I actually look forward to going to Union Station to stop at Pilot Coffee.  Very few other reasons for happiness at Union. . . 

The espresso beverages and the baked goods are excellent.  Probably in my top 5 favourite coffee places in the Downtown Core."}
