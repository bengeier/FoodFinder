{"text":"Repairs on your house are never fun! I needed an outlet outlet replaced & a friend gave Keith's number   Heath and his son Zack came out and did the job in minutes! No nonsense, great guy!! I highly highly recommend these guys!"}
{"text":"We had some work done, and my only issue was getting yelled at. Every time I said something Keith very abrasively yelled at me and cut me off. The customer wishes should be listened to. I really let it go, until my child said something about the electrician yelling at me. Then I decided to leave a review. He should try to learn customer service as well as electricity. Just put on a thick skin before calling him."}
{"text":"I have had Keith do several projects for me recently.  He has always worked with my schedule and done the work quickly and at a reasonable fee.  Keith is a true professional and it is very apparent he knows his craft well.  It is always impressive to watch how easy he makes the most difficult tasks look.  I would highly recommend him if you are in need of an honest, fair and very experienced electrician."}
{"text":"Had Keith come out again for another problem we were having (dryer wasn't heating up).  We called him in the afternoon, and he came out when all his other jobs were finished at 8:30pm and fixed the problem in less than thirty minutes. I don't know of another electrician who would have come out so late at such late notice. Keith is dedicated, great at his job, and has reasonable prices. I don't know a single reason why anyone would choose a different electrician."}
{"text":"Keith and his son did a great job mounting two flood lights on the backside and front of my house. I was also having trouble setting my pool timer and Keith took the time and showed me how to reset. They were very prompt, professional, and reasonably priced. Definitely will call again for future electrical needs. Thanks very much!"}
{"text":"I called Keith for an electrical quote, he answered 'hello?'. He seemed bothered by my call initially as he was in a meeting, he asked me to text him, I texted him as requested and waited...for a few days. He finally responded late one evening and asked for my address to see if he would be in the area and could POSSIBLY stop by , I texted him the address and have not heard from him again.(Sorry you don't want to make money dude)..I can't speak for the quality of work he does but I would not hire him if he cannot communicate properly with potential clients. My job was not a little job either, money could have been made."}
{"text":"Great work!! I had my entry way rewired removed my recessed cans and installed a chandelier. Rewired my pool room... No problems, fast and friendly!!!!"}
{"text":"I hired Top of the Hill Electrical services since a friend had them out to his house and said they were reasonable and did their job well.  They showed up a few minutes early and Keith and Chris got right to work.  They installed a large TV stand in the wall of my Master Bedroom, hung the 48 inch TV, installed a new outlet & cable receptacle up high behind the TV.  They did a great job! I felt that they respected my home and furnishings. I will definitely call them again!   :)"}
{"text":"I am very pleased with the work Top of the Hill Electric performed on my house. Keith was on time, extremely friendly, and also the best price I could find. While shopping on my own for the security motion sensor lights I was buying he answered all of my questions via email and text. The job was done quickly and professionally. I was very pleased and now I feel a little bit safer taking my puppies out back at night and having a beautifully lit back yard. 

Thank you guys."}
{"text":"Yesterday at 4:30 PM,  a bulb exploded in the bathroom.  Power was gone.  I checked the fuses.  All were good.  Checked everything I could think of but still no power.
Called Keith at Top of the Hill Electric.  I got his name from Yelp by asking for top rated electricians.  
After explaining to Keith the problem, he said he was working on a project till about 8:00 but would stop by afterward on his way home,  How impressive is that?  I expected that he'd put me off until the next morning at the least but same day?
Anyway, he arrived a little before 8:00 and set to work.  In no time he'd found the problem and fixed it.  
All this was simply amazing but more amazing was the very reasonable bill he presented me with.
Seems his day started at 6:00 am and here he was working at past 8 pm.  How tired he must have been but he put his customer first.!
Fast, dedicated service and reasonable price!  What more can you ask?
Thank you Keith and thank you Yelp for putting us together."}
{"text":"I called Top of the Hill to help with a circuit breaker that would not reset.  Keith answered and gave me advice on what could be causing the problem, and was onsite within an hour.  After reviewing the issue, and what I had already done, he decided to check a couple outlets to find the problem source.  He found the problem on the first outlet he checked - a little luck but definitely a lot of experience with troubleshooting electric circuits.  The cost was a service charge that was very reasonable, I'll be having him back for additional electrical work in the future."}
{"text":"I called Top of The Hill based on Yelp Reviews .. Wish I could give them more stars.. I had 4 can lights installed in a dark room around my pool table and a box for a future pool table light .. Fast .. On time .. Very reasonable prices and very very professional ... I will have Keith and his son install a Fan fixture box in another room that has no switches or lights in it soon..  Thanks Guys .."}
{"text":"Moved into a new home that had been previously owned by a supposed retired electrician and it had multiple unique and questionable wiring issues throughout the house inside and out. Called and had Keith come out to see if he could correct these issues and bring everything up to code. 
WOW! Did I make the right call. Keith and his son came out to looked things over and came up with solutions to every issue making sure things were up to code and just the way I wanted them. Outstanding job and there will be nobody else I will ever call to have any electrical work done in the future."}
{"text":"Keith was in my house for tops 10 minutes and solved both of my electrical problems. He even made a guess over the phone about the first one (and he was right!). I will definitely be using him again."}
{"text":"Keith is extremely knowledgeable,  an expert in his field. He explains things well and thoroughly, he's extremely efficient, responsive, communicative, and overall a pleasure to work with. Most importantly, his estimate was SPOT ON and affordable compared to others I obtained for the same job. I will be requiring additional electrical services in the near future, and I will only be calling Keith/Top of the Hill. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Thank you, Keith."}
{"text":"We needed a ceiling fan and light switch installed. Keith and his son were quick and efficient to get the job done with no obstacles along the way. He even assembled the fan for us before he installed it. My husband and I are pleased with his service and plan to use him for our future electrical projects."}
{"text":"I called Top of the Hill Electric because of the good reviews on Yelp.

I have been attempting to arrange an appointment with Keith for the last three days.  After a lot of back and forth, I ended up calling a different electrician.  His availability time was limited, there were a lot of excuses, and he seemed uninterested in the job.  What ended up being the deal-breaker was that he refused to provide an on-site quote with my designer as I had other business to attend to.      

Poor communication and poor customer service."}
{"text":"Pedro and Adam came out today to do some minor work on our house. Little things that other electricians have missed. Pedro knew exactly what the issue was and fixed them so quickly. He is very knowledgeable. Adam was in training but he knew more than previous electricians that we have had out to the house. The price was also very reasonable. They installed a new chandelier and fixed some outdoor lights for us. They also explained how all the gfcis are working with which rooms. Very friendly and also arrived on time."}
{"text":"Keith installed 3 outlets for me. He was prompt, courteous, professional, and reasonable. Great service, great experience! I would absolutely use him again for any future electrical needs!"}
{"text":"I hired Keith install 2 spot lights on the side of my home and change out a switch to an automatic timer on my exterior lights.  The total cost was very reasonable considering he climbed into my attic to install the lights and run the wire through the wall so that my switch looked installed very clean.  I was surprised how little time it took him and his extensive knowledge of his work.  I also found out he has running his own electrical company for the past 20 years in New York and is starting a branch out here."}
{"text":"Wow, Keith and his son are the best.  Had problems with sockets and switches not working.  Keith came out and identified and fixed it all in less than an hour.   His price was really reasonable.  I had paid a family member who was an electrician apprentice more than that to come out, rip out my switches then tell me he could not figure it out!    Keith is my new family member!  One who is reliable and good at what he does.  Thank you, Keith and son!"}
{"text":"Keith is the best electrician I have ever worked with. I own a local real estate property management company and there isn't another electrician I trust more in handling the issues that arise for us or our clients on a regular basis. Keith keeps it simple and cost effective. He isn't some large electrical contractor where you never know what kind of electric service you are getting or where you wonder who is showing up at your door. He services his clients. He takes care of us. Shoot, I've even referred him to even some of our most unforgiving clients, and he provided exceptional service with a smile. I always trust what Keith says and take his recommendation above all other electricians because I know he is giving me honest feedback. Great service AND pricing is really hard to find in this industry. Thank you Top of the Hill."}
