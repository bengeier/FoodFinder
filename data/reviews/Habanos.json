{"text":"Great food,warm ambiance,however as a lunch destination its hit or miss as to whether the place is open"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and everything was flavourful. The shrimp was so good.   The people were friendly and welcoming , a homey sort of feeling.  The service a little slow , but we had plenty of time and it was relatively busy.   The Cuban espresso was amazing !!  We will definitely go back .  I know I will back even just for a cup of that wonderful coffee."}
