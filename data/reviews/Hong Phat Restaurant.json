{"text":"Location: 2/5
Definitely a little hard to spot. It's on the corner and easy to drive by a couple of times.

Atmosphere / Ambiance: 1.5/5
Don't come here for the atmosphere. It doesn't exist. It's take-out only so don't come here for a date. The decor is extremely dated. There's an 85.0 rating posted but eh, that seems a little high.

Cleanliness: 2.5/5
See the skeptical 85.0 rating mention above. This place is less of a Chinese restaurant, more of a corner-store / bodega. You might even be able to even get a pack of Newports there. 

Service: 3/5
Miss Lee is your quintessential Chinese restaurant owner. Makes me feel like I'm back home in Brooklyn. She's cordial if you are as well and pretty hilarious if you get her sense of humor.

Food: 4/5
The wings. The hot wings. They are the truth. I love wings and I've got to say that these rank pretty high for me. There's Mac's Speed Shop for smoked wings, then there's Miss Lee's hot wings. You've got to give it a try if you're a fan of wings. I need to try the other menu one day.

Value: 5/5
20 wings for under $14.00. Do the math. That's a great price."}

{"text":"I was looking for a \"hole in a wall spot\" and this is it. This spot is not for everyone. Very small, very sketchy, cash only, extremely  slow serves in a neighborhood  that most will not go. Lucky for me I'm not most. I felt right at home.

As for the the food...everything looked good that I seen but my rating is all about the WINGS. I got the 6 pc. W/ fries and 6 pc. W/ fried rice. Total was only $11.75. Tried both the mild and medium sauce and.... Wow!!! Very good. Will I go back...MOST DEFINITELY!!

Quick tips: bring cash, be patient and order by phone. If not wait time may be an hour or more. Orders by phone get priority."}
{"text":"I do believe that Hong Phat is permanently closed this time! If anyone who is a frequent visitor as I am, you can recall that the family has closed the restaurant for long periods in the last two years. I heard that Ms. Lee's husband, the cook has not been well. Today I called the # and the phone is disconnected!! That has never happened before in the past. I think they're out of business."}
{"text":"They got good chicken wings that's really the only thing that I've ever ate from here is chicken wings and french fries. I just wish it didn't look like a one bedroom apartment lol"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you. This place has some of the best chicken Wings and rice in CLT. Definitely is a local spot. Sad that is not open anymore. Hope all is well with Mrs. Lee."}
{"text":"Great hot wings and shrimp friend rice. The facade is deceiving. Don't expect awesome service, just appreciate the food."}
{"text":"Excellent wings and pork fried rice they are so good that ive been there several times and always get the same thing big pieces of pork in the rice"}
{"text":"This place has the best wings in town! Their vegetable fried rice is the absolute best!! The place has been there for years and need some work done. Ms Lee has been there for years. If you can get past the way the building looks...then you have found some goood food!!"}
