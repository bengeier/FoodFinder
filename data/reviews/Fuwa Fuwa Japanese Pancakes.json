{"text":"My first experience at Fuwa Fuwa has been really positive. I have already tried two of their item, the Raspberries & Caramelized banana pancake and the Tiramisu Pancake both surprisingly delicious. The good thing about these pancakes is that they are not too sweet and really soft. The Tiramisu one makes you feel that you really are eating a tiramisu because of the right choice of the ingredients. The other item i tried has a lighter taste that makes you enjoy the caramelized banana and Raspberries. For each itrem you can add ice cream if you want. I had matcha and also vanilla ice cream for the perfect pairing. The overall experience made me really happy and i'm willing to go back asap."}
{"text":"This place is overhyped . Since the business is fairly new, it's pretty disorganized and small inside. There is a line outside due to the lack of space inside. The pancakes are nothing special. Tastes like uncle tetsu type of texture. Overall, it is good but kind of pricey and you only get two pancakes"}
{"text":"Good food. But very poor service. The server or manager was rather rude and passive aggressive."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend this past weekend. When we arrived, we waited approximately 30 minutes to get in. I ordered the matcha red bean pancake and he got the raspberry and caramelized banana pancake. The presentation was ok, but the taste was really bland, and the fruits were sour. The WORST part is that we both started experiencing stomachaches in the day after.  Will not be returning in the future."}
{"text":"I had won two free pancake coupons through Instagram, which meant that a visit to Fuwa Fuwa was well on its way! Given the many droolworthy Instagram shots circulating the Internet, my body was definitely ready for this day.  Bad rhymes aside, I really was excited to finally try these well promoted Japanese souffle pancakes! I had come a couple weeks before for the free pancakes on its grand opening, but upon seeing the dreadfully long line, had decided to return another time. This time, I was well prepared and so chose to come right at 11am sharp, when the shop was officially open for operations. Holy cow, can you believe that despite coming this early, there was already a line?! The doors had just opened, and we were already table #15 in line. Ultimately, we waited over an hour before we were seated.  Operations run quite interestingly here. After being seated, you go to the counter to order your food, which the servers then bring to your table. Unfortunately, we were seated on the ledger facing the wall, but that just meant that I was able to see the entire kitchen operations! It's run like an assembly line - they literally take portions amounts, place it on the grill for a set time, whip up cream and top as desired.  We saw a very interesting menu item being served - it had the soufflé pancakes, but topped with whipped cream and sugar, and served with a massive amount of sliced strawberries with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I really wanted to order this, but it's apparently a secret menu item and therefore off limits for the free coupon (it's called Strawberry Forest, and is $23).  I ended up getting the tiramisu (was debating between that and the matcha red beans, but the cashier recommended the tiramisu as the bestseller) while my sister got the crème brulee. Her friends both ordered the original signature; one with an additional scoop of ice cream and one without.  Be sure to eat the pancakes fast, as the texture hardens and stiffens with every passing moment! Moreover, as stated by the other reviews, there isn't much taste to the pancakes - the flavour really depends on your toppings and sauce. I would also recommend getting ice cream on the side, as the varying texture and flavour helps lighten up the otherwise dense and bland pancake.  Original Signature: This was by far the most aesthetically pleasing! It was also the lightest in flavour (both the tiramisu and crème brulee got heavier with every bite); therefore, the two companions that ordered this finished their pancakes in record time. The addition of the whipped cream and strawberries make this a Japanese classic!  Crème Brulee: I found this to be the heaviest in flavour. It doesn't really taste like crème brulee (missing the vanilla fragrance), and there really isn't much variance in flavour. At the end of it, the semisweet custard just all tasted like one mush of who knows what. To be honest, I wasn't a fan of the caramelized banana, as the flavour and taste was sickeningly overpowering. This was my least favourite, but the ice cream was a wonderful and welcome addition!  Tiramisu: Oh, how I regret not adding ice cream to this! It would've made everything better. You're given coffee syrup on the side; eating the pancake along with the syrup, cream, and cocoa powder really gives off the tiramisu vibe. It's interesting, but again, on the heavy side. I didn't manage to finish mine!  Overall, it was a good experience. The food was decent and fun and Insta-worthy, and the servers and employees were super friendly and accommodating! Will definitely come again to share a dish with a friend (my small appetite meant I couldn't finish it all), and will definitely get the signature with ice cream on the side!"}
{"text":"30-40 min wait ....Way too long for take out. The flow from the welcoming to the ordering and seating is awkward. First and last visit for sure, it's not even a busy day, I can't even imagine a busy day. For $15 this is what I got."}
{"text":"Exquisite and heavenly are only a few words to describe the experience at Fuwa Fuwa. The silky smooth pancakes are great and the staff were very friendly!  Try the Creme Brûlée Pancake with Vanilla Ice Cream for a true experience!"}
{"text":"Really cool place! Super nice staff and really nice inside. We had to take it to go as we had our dog with us so we are it in the car. It was super light and fluffy and a great flavour. The whipped cream was fresh and good fruit on top. Will be back to try out the tiramisu version as that looked good too!"}
{"text":"This place is an interesting addition to the dessert scene. I am not familiar with souffle pancakes out of Japan. However being a fan Japanese food was looking forward to this visit. The space is tight with a couple of counter areas and some tables. The behind the counter looked cramped as quite a few people were behind it. The made to order approach is enticing given this approach to pancakes. After a bit of observation they are using a similar technique to le mere poulard legendary souffle omelettes. Folks this is one labour intensive approach to making an otherwise simple item. We are talking about half an hour or so to make an omelette!  Anyway there are a few options on offer when ordering and one can add a scoop of ice cream as well. I went the simple route and ordered the original.  As expected the wait is long. The pancakes look like an Instagram dream. The taste matches as well. Light and fluffy. The maple syrup and cream help. The butter is wasted IMO as they are a bit cold to melt on the top. Top marks here folks and I will be back. I do suggest one not be put off with the wait time as this is a quality product."}
{"text":"These pancakes were insanely soft and delicious. I've never tasted anything like this before, not even in Japan. Great location and service was very friendly and professional. Highly recommended for a special treat for a special someone."}
{"text":"I came here late afternoon on a weekday and it was pretty busy but managed to get a table. The interior is clean, bright and modern.   I decided to try the Crème Brûlée pancake with matcha ice cream since they ran out of vanilla ice cream and I could pick between strawberry and matcha ice cream. The pancake came out nice and fluffy in which I had some fun jiggling them before eating. I like that it wasn't too sweet and paired well with my iced matcha latte which tasted so refreshing on a hot afternoon. Overall, I might come back again soon with some friends to try the other flavours!"}
{"text":"I was a bit taken aback by the line up outside of Fuwa Fuwa when I came to visit on a Sunday afternoon. There were around 6 groups ahead of us but we had no choice. The space was small, only a few tables to accommodate small groups. After waiting for about 20 minutes or so one of the staffs served all of us in line with a cup of water. I thought that was a nice, heartwarming gesture. Once I got in (after another 10 minutes or so), I realized I had to order my food at the front counter. As I was contemplating which flavours to choose from, the front counter staff suggested to me that they also have a secret menu item for strawberry lovers at a cost of $23. It was tempting but I ended up ordering their signature pancakes with strawberry and a plate of tiramisu pancakes to share with my husband.  The pancakes themselves were very fluffy and jiggly. They didn't really have a strong eggy flavour that I thought they would have. The tiramisu pancakes tasted better than the signature strawberry pancakes. Strong espresso flavour and the chocolate drizzle was a great touch. We ended up adding the chocolate drizzle to the signature as well for extra punch. We ordered 2 scoops of vanilla and matcha ice creams ($2) to go with  both of the pancakes. And they made sure the flavour of the ice cream pair well with the pancake flavours that I was ordering. The vanilla went with the strawberry signature and the matcha went with the tiramisu. I do recommend adding ice creams (even though it costs $2  for a small scoop) to the pancakes because they just really go well together. Without the ice cream, the pancakes would be quite bland.  Overall, the service was great despite seeing them quite hectic fulfilling orders non stop. The price was a bit pricey for two slices of pancakes however. And, since they were so light, you'd feel like nothing's in your stomach even though you just dropped over $10 for food."}
{"text":"Warning: this place is small and busy. Be ready to line up for it!  I am not really into sweet stuff but I really like this place. Their souffle pancake were really fluffy and very tasty. I had the macha and creme brulee pancake for the first time. I would prefer the macha one over the creme brulee one because the creme brulee is a little too sweet for me. Also their macha ice cream is very tasty and it goes well with the pancake. Then I went back on the same week to try their Tiramisu pancake and I would say the Tiramisu pancake is my favourite. The coffee sauce on the side goes really well with the cream and chocolate on the pancake.Overall it was a very good match.  Value wise I would like say this place is on the pricey side but I would say it was worth it. I would definitely go back many times when I crave for souffle pancakes."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of people mentioned this newly opened cafe recently so I went to try. The place is very tiny and seats are really narrow. The Japanese pancake is not as good as I imaged. It tastes like cotton candy and the cream on top is very sweet."}
{"text":"Tiny but trendy place in Toronto. It took me approximately an hour to be seated..but it was totally worth to wait..when u found the traditional Japanese soufflé pancake fluffily and softly melting in ur mouth..what a perfect match with fresh fruits.. Must order: the signature soufflé pancake.."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was just decent for the price. Came with a friend during a short stay in Toronto - - we got the signature and the crème brulee pancakes to share, and I got a london fog. Everything was good, but the hype had us expecting to be blown away. We weren't, but it was still a good meal - - nothing was heavy or too sweet, the flavors were balanced. The servers were really friendly too!"}
{"text":"We went there during their soft opening and the whole experience was underwhelming.   Without knowing it was more of a self-serve/order at the counter type of restaurant, we called a few days earlier to make a reservation for 4 people for a weekend. We were not told anything about that the restaurant is not really a sit down brunch place, especially for big group. We arrived at the restaurant and it was very busy. We were told the next big table that became available would be us but we waited for about 30-45min and still not available. We ended up taking a two-people small table and asked to borrow two chairs from nearby tables and made ourselves seated.   While we were waiting for the table, we ordered the food at the counter since it takes a bit time to make. For a breakfast/bakery place, I asked for tea but they only have canned cold tea beverage :( The POS machine asked for 15%,18% and 20% tips by defaults even though there's minimal service.   Finally our coffee and pancakes arrived. The pancakes themselves were as advertised, but the coffee mug was very dirty on the rim from the splashes generated from the coffee machine and possibly during its being brought to our table. We were then told they ran out of proper utensils and we could only use take-out fork and spoon. Everything seems to be falling apart and we complained to the manager. He offered us some free infused fruits water and an egg pudding. It's a nice gesture. The pudding was actually quite delicious.   Over all, I think the experience, price and service is only worth 2 stars but the food itself is worth 3.5 stars. So I'm giving 3 starts after giving everything into thoughts."}
{"text":"Honestly, I do not understand the hype. I was really excited to drive all the way to downtown to try their souffle pancake. However, I was super disappointed.   Firstly, the souffle pancake did not jiggle... at all. So it was like eating a thick pancake. Why would I pay for $10+ just for that?? When I could be eating a full brunch....   Next, the Kyoto matcha latte was sooo weak. I expected a way stronger green tea base especially for something that cost almost $6; I would rather go to Starbucks.   Not only that, I ordered hot lattes too for the latte art as I saw in some pictures... but mine barely had it? You can look at the photo for reference. I don't even know how to describe. The best thing about the latte is that it was smooth however made really weak...  I don't really know what to compliment here. I guess the best thing about this little cafe is their service. I doubt I'll be back though. Next!!   LET ME DO AN UPDATE, a clarification, to the response of the business:  It's definitely not my first time having souffle pancakes. The first thing we did, the SECOND it arrived to the table, was to see if they jiggle, for BOTH orders. We were ready and was doing it for the IG, but to be led to disappointment. The business suggest the tiramisu or creme brulee because its stacked only means it should be more noticeable but doesn't mean the others shouldn't jiggle.  When it jiggles,  it shows how fluffy and on point it is made. By the way, eating it right away has nothing to do with the jiggle-ness of a souffle pancake.   Oh and by the way, if somethings are made, and doesn't meet requirements, don't serve it then. If you serve it, well then be prepared that it'll hurt your reputation, good or bad. For example, your latte art.   I'm extremely disappointed with the business response. If you failed, apologize and say you'll take the criticism and improve and do better in the future. Turning the review around isn't going to help your business.   Thanks to your response, it went from 2 star to 1. Also, deleting your first response to this, doesn't mean I didn't read it either. Just to let you know, I had my fair shares of souffle pancakes in Asia and other newly open cafes in Toronto. I'm pretty sure I know what I'm eating. Just to let you know, I wasn't there alone. I had 3 other friends who felt the same.  JUST SAYING."}
{"text":"We've ordered the tiramisu and creme brûlée pancake. As we walk in, they inform us the wait time is approximately 30-40 mins. They actually meant the wait time is for the pancakes.  The seats are just first come first serve. I think this japanese pancake place heavily depends on what you choose as the flavour, for example, the creme brûlée or tiramisu, otherwise the pancake itself just have that egg flavour. Whereas the other comparable Japanese pancake place, the actual pancake has flavour. Overall not a bad experience."}
{"text":"We ordered the original and a tropical tonic. The pancake was fluffy, eggy and creamy though not all that heavy or greasy. Could be too light for a sweet tooth but I enjoyed it. The gold fork was fancy, but it couldn't quite cut through the butter or the mint leaf (might be the case that the leaf was not meant to be eaten but...)  The tonic though feels really overly priced. The presentation is certainly vibrant and all, but that alone does not warrant the price of a bubble tea or Starbucks unless I significantly underestimated the price of tonic water and fruits. Pretty good drink for a hot day all being said.  The service was pleasing and quick. The place was spacious and decently quiet, a good place to chat and idle."}
{"text":"Decided to bring my boyfriend here since he doesn't live in town and we both loved them!!! We got the creme brûlée, tiramisu and the signature soufflé and it was so good!  The waiter when serving jiggled both our plates and told us to eat them right away because than it stops jiggling as much.   The kitchen is right at the counter so it smells really good when you enter! It's about a 30 min wait after you place your order."}
{"text":"Fuwa Fuwa was one of the foodie destinations we were excited to try during our trip to Toronto. Unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. Like some of the reviews mentioned here, the staff (mostly the cashier really for us) was not well trained at all. We waited over an hour in line to dine in. Once we sat down and ordered, the cashier ran over to us and said in order to dine in we had to order the same number of items as the number of people in the party. Maybe it was because it was we had a party of 5. So we were forced to order 5 items total or had to leave. Fine. So we ordered 5. Then we realized everyone around us ordered less than the number of people in their party. That already left a sour taste in our mouth but we didn't say anything.  Then the store manager came over and said we had to wait about 15 mins for our food since there was a large takeout order. We understood it was very busy so we were ok with that. We waited then realized everyone who ordered after us got the food and we still didn't. We went to ask the cashier and that's when  it got really intolerable. So basically we ordered twice because he forced us to order 5 things in total. We never got the pancakes we ordered in the first order. Then when asked they said they didn't have the order.  So basically the cashier forgot to send in the first order. Then when we complained to him he blatantly denied it was his fault at all and said it is because it was too busy and asked if we understood them. Yea man I understood it was busy but you were already 45 mins late when we were told 15 minutes. He kept on arguing with us and we got fed up and said we wanted our money back. They wasted 2 hours of our time and the cashier didn't apologize at all. If this is how they want to treat customers then that's hugely disappointing.  The manager said he would refund us and the cashier only gave us back the money for the first order because they already gave us the pancakes from the second order. He said he couldn't refund it because we started eating it. Sir, we never touched it. The manager did try to apologize and said would give us the meal for free and give money back so I give him props for that. But by the time we were done arguing we had no more appetite to eat.   It was such a disappointing experience and until they improve I wouldn't recommend going."}
{"text":"Went there on a weekday to avoid the line and it was a good call. There was a small line when I arrived but it got pretty busy once I sat down. The place is tiny with about 5 tables and 10 bar table seats. Although it was small, I prefer to eat in as the service is great.  When we sat down on the bar seats near the cash, it was tight when people are passing. One suggestion is to have people preorder with the menu near middle area and pay one at a time as it could clog the walkway going to the washroom. another suggestion is to have hooks or a basket under those seats to store bags or jackets.  In terms of our order, we ordered the creme brulee pancake with strawberry ice cream as they ran out of vanilla. The pancake came with some fruits as well as the sugar coating on top of the pancake and banana. Although it was somewhat pricey, it's good to share with someone as it is very fluffy and filling.  I also ordered a tropic detox water which had pineapple, apples and pear. It was just ok but I was in need of a detox. I will try to come again as long as it's not too busy. The website states that they take reservations as a private party booking the entire place. Not sure what the details to do that."}
{"text":"Please note this is a Product Review so I received these items for free for a product review of this company.  I've been meaning to come here to try their delicious fluffy pancakes so finally had a chance at last! Seems like the Creme Brulee Pancake is their signature dish and the most popular here. Basically you get 2 ultra fluffy eggy pancakes stacked on each other. The dish is also served with torched slices of banana, a scoop of ice cream (green tea) and fresh fruit.  I simply loved it! It was freshly made and was simply delicious. I definitely would have eaten more. Nice presentation on the plate. You can definitely taste a lot of egg in this kind of pancake and the texture is much more soft than your average pancake. The sauce on the pancake was pretty good and not too sweet. I also ordered the green tea latte which was alright- nothing too unique about it   The price point is a bit steep for a pancake though but seems to attract a good crowd as it got busy as I was finishing up around 2. Seems like dining in is the only option. Make sure to arrive early as there is limited seating.   Overall, it was a great dining experience. Service fron the staff was great and loved the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Fuwa Fuwa's pancakes are by far the fluffiest, softest ones I've ever had! Matcha ice cream and earl grey on the side just made my time there perfect! Great service and very friendly staff. The only thing is I wish the restaurant is bigger to fit more people in, because I can see them being popular! I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The service was awful. We waited for 40 minutes for our takeout order. They served people behind us first. They did not put in red bean for our matcha red bean pancake, and was very begrudging even when we asked about it. There was a hair in our takeout box."}
{"text":"There's been an influx of Insta posts on souffle pancakes lately so ofc, I had to try Toronto's latest food trend xD. I was surprised to see how small the store was when we arrived. There were only 4-5 small tables with 2 rows of bar seats. It was especially cramped at the back where there were people lining up, others waiting around, some at the bar seat, and the staff working in the kitchen. Luckily, my friend and I were able to get a seat at one of the tables closer to the front of the store. She ordered the strawberry, blueberry, and banana pancake while I had the tiramisu one.   The tiramisu pancake came with cocoa powder, mascarpone-infused whipped cream, dark chocolate drizzle, and a couple of berries. It did fairly well in mimicking the flavors of a tiramisu. And I liked having the drizzle on the side so that it's not drowned in syrup. As for the pancakes themselves, they were quite fluffy; almost like an airier version of uncle tetsu's cheesecake after it's been fridged. And as someone else commented, the taste does vary a lot depending on what you compliment it with; otherwise, it's just eggy with a hint of sweetness.   Overall, I found the price ($15ish after tax) to be a bit steep for what it is, but it's worth a try. And it'll be better to visit on a weekday if you don't want to line up and be cramped."}
{"text":"This place is from Japan where they do stuff with precision and high standards.  Quality was good as was execution: fluffy, very light pancakes, sauces are also light and the sweetness is subtle  Ice creams are also of good quality.  Staff are earnest and friendly  Nice clean modern space"}
{"text":"Really super nice staff at Fuwa Fuwa, I came in wearing my baby and was greeted by great staff members.  The cafe is adorable, clean lines, minimal and cute.  We got there early afternoon on a weekday and it was packed!    But we did find a bar seat and before our order came up we got a regular table seat (which is much easier when wearing a newborn child).   Their menu of super fluffy Japanese pancakes is all variations on their original pancakes.  Their menu ranges from $11 to $15.80 .... and it features their original pancake with maple syrup, to some of their more fun toppings like creme brûlée and tiramisu!    However, they have a secret menu.   They have a dish that's called strawberry forest and I didn't know what to expect so I ordered it.  At $22 a plate before tax, it seemed pricy so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm a sucker for secret menus so I tried it anyways.   Holy strawberry forest is a pretty accurate description.  It is their 2 original pancakes, topped with whipped cream, strawberries and some strawberry sauce, surrounded by about a pound of perfectly ripe sweet summer strawberries.    Considering a pound of strawberries, depending on the season ranges from 2.99 to 7.99 at the supermarket and most of the time they aren't guaranteed to be sweet....I don't think it's that expensive for this dish.   It's definitely a sharing plate for 2, and the least sweet option of everything the offer....and we loved it.    So I've talked about the fruit, but I haven't talked about Japanese soufflé pancakes.   It was my first time trying soufflé pancakes, after seeing it countless times on instagram.   Soufflé pancakes are really light fluffy (and when warm, jiggly and slightly foamy) light cakes.   It's more of a soufflé super light cake texture then your traditional pancake, it's also more on the sweeter side then a traditional pancake.   I enjoyed it as a fun dessert...it went well with the pile of fresh strawberries and complimented well with freshly whipped cream.    I also got their iced matcha latte.  It's a simple latte and the sweetness was up to me to add (which I just left unsweetened).  Refreshing and light, so I can appreciate the the dessert.   Just keep in mind that Japanese soufflé pancakes batter is really really thick , and they take a long time to cook!   Don't be surprised if you are waiting for at least 20 mins for your order... it needs to be fresh and it needs all that time to cook.  Those who are looking for a quick dessert should be warned and not complain about how long it takes."}
{"text":"My first time trying these Japanese fluffy pancakes after seeing it online for so long! They didn't disappoint. The pancakes were not sweet so it was perfect for my friend who didn't have much of a sweet tooth like me.   I highly recommend getting ice cream with your pancake because it just makes it better! The pancakes are warm and tastes sooo good paired with ice cream!   It is on the little more pricey side for a dessert but because of the portion, it's easily to be shared between 2-3 people, and I would definitely recommend it being shared! Overall I think it's worth to try!"}
{"text":"Check ahead to see their hours. It's their soft opening and Google doesn't have the correct hours, it says closed but I saw it was open from BlogTo.  Taste wise I can't tell the difference between this place any other shop that offers the soufflé pancakes (like Tsujiri). You can try for the novelty. This place is definitely cute and has the Japanese aesthetics. I'd recommend the plain 'original' one or the berry one.   Personally I'm not very into the soufflé pancake hype that's coming to Toronto, but these are decent for less than $15. Serving size is okay but I wouldn't call it a meal.   And I'm guessing after BlogTo's publicity post today, this place may be flooded with customers, won't be surprised if lines start to form."}
{"text":"A delightful dessert! I ordered the Tiramisu Pancake and they incorporated the cocoa power, whipped cream and coffee drizzle very well to mimic the flavours of tiramisu.   The pancakes are very light and airy, and a little sweet with a slight hint of egg. The toppings contribute to most of the flavour. Downside for me is the lack of flavour in the pancakes with an overwhelming amount of cocoa (the dish started to taste bitter) and the more raw batter compared to Hanabusa.   The wait for the pancakes near their closing was about 15 minutes - not too bad for a full shop. Definitely would come back to try another flavour!"}
{"text":"The Fuwa Fuwa Signature was pretty good - the strawberries, blueberries and bananas were very sweet and fresh. I also liked the Tiramisu pancake with cream and chocolate syrup! The texture of the pancake itself is fluffy like sponge cake.   The flat white was a bit too strong for my liking.   Interior is quite small, expect some wait time."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday evening with some friends, the place was fairly narrow, packed in like canned sardines. So they gave us menus as we came in and we basically went to the counter to order our pancakes and pay, then they would bring us our order. We ended up sitting at the counter area across from the cashier and kitchen? I ordered their Fuwa Fuwa Signature and it was meh, it was too overhyped. They stated wait time for the pancakes can be from 20-30 mins but I think our order came under or around 10 minutes.  This place lost 2 stars because of these reasons: - Staff handling and making food wore no hairnets nor gloves from what I was observing - If gloves were worn...there was no change of gloves which is bad because possible cross contamination - Inconsistent pancake texture, mine came almost completely raw as I cut into it, most of the batter seeped out and sort of clung to the plate vs another friend who had a completely cooked perfect pancake - Steep price to pay for pancakes  - Ended up quite sick after having due reasons above  Overall, your choice if you would like to see what the hype is and I, myself, might give this place another chance, in a few months to see if the consistency of pancakes improves"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Fuwa Fuwa but unfortunately, after my experience today, I will not be coming back.  After an hour of waiting outside on the sidewalk, a couple decided to bypass the long line and just stroll right up to the cashier to order. Clearly, the staff have not yet implemented a fair system to keep track of waiting customers as the couple was allowed to order and pay without waiting... When we informed the employee, they simply replied by saying \"sorry, but they already paid....\" Rather than handling the situation professionally and at the expense of their customers waiting patiently for over an hour, they just told the couple they would receive their order, but it would have to be to-go. I informed them that the restaurant should return their order until everyone else in the line had been served. Instead, I had to watch this inconsiderate couple get their pancakes and full service before anyone else waiting in line had... the staff didn't even apologize to the customers waiting!! The employees clearly preferred to avoid a potentially awkward situation than to address the issue professionally. The experience left a bad taste in my mouth and was probably more disappointing than the mediocre meal we had."}
{"text":"I came Toronto for vacations and my friend brought me here to try the hottest dessert trend at Toronto downtown.   There was a short line when I arrived the shop around 1045am. The shop opened at 11 sharp and the staffs gave us a number to order with.   I ordered a cream brûlée pancakes and wait about 15 mins as cashier told. The pancake is so soft and fluffy as well. Portion is large and not too sweet for me. Unfortunately, yelp is not allowed me to post the fluffy pancake video... I made brunch of videos of its fluffiness....  Surprisingly, Fuwa Fuwa is extremely underrated. I was so surprised to have high quality Japanese dessert for my day and I would defiantly come back Toronto just for this. Willing to try their various product for consistency (seems they are having peach pancake recently) ."}
{"text":"Delicious, very fluffy pancakes, friendly and helpful staff - this place is great! Tried the creme brûlée and the tiramisu pancakes. Both were phenomenal."}
{"text":"Made a trip to Fuwa Fuwa to try their signature Soufflé Pancakes and they were so drool worthy. It was predictable though seeing the astonished reactions on other customers faces once they took their very first bite.  The pancake itself was fluffy and moist. Both my sister and I loved the Creme Brulee version the most because its top layer of hard caramel constrasted well with the soft texture of the pancake. Moreover, the cold vanilla icecream also soaked nicely into it as it melted over time. . *Origin: Soufflé Pancakes were served in weddings in Japan to bring happiness with its fluffy textures and adorable silhouette."}
{"text":"Service is slow but they took preparation serious. Store staff not very experienced with customer service and crowd management. Food was worth the wait. Coffee was great too."}
{"text":"I tried the creme brulee Japanese pancakes here as it is their house special.  I noticed a sign at the front to say that there is no takeout option for the creme brulee and that convinced me that it must be so good that it has to be eaten immediately.  The creme brulee Japanese pancake can be described as two ultra fluffy and eggy pancakes stacked with a not-too-sweet custard topped with a hard torched sugar piece.  The dish is served with two small pieces of torched bananas, a scoop of ice cream and fresh fruit garnish.  I loved it and I think I can honestly eat two of these plates to myself.  I think they should offer a \"double my pancake order\" for fatties like me.  The pancake is unlike your typical breakfast pancake in that it has a lot of egg taste to it, and even the colour of the batter looks to be more yellow.    The in-house drinks - we tried the matcha and earl grey milk teas iced and they came unsweetened.  The serving mug is a bit small for an iced drink, but I like that they leave it unsweetened so that extra sugar can be added to taste.  My advice is to skip the drinks and order double pancakes!"}
{"text":"I had the fuwa fuwa signature without ice cream. it jiggled a little when moving the plate left and right. after the first bite, I think it is the best pancake I ever had. Cream on the top and pancake filling are way SOO perfect. Not too sweet:)  Be prepared to wait for more than 15 mins blc pancakes are made right after you ordered. no need to be impatient and the pancakes worth the waiting time. Plus the staff is really nice. I ordered another take out after having one at the dessert place, but I picked it up later than expected and cream was unfortunately melt. Staff insisted to make me a new one and like to ensure customers can enjoy takeout experiences too."}
{"text":"This is everything I've dreamed a souffle pancake to be.  You have to order first and they'll bring the order to your table. Seems like other people had nightmare wait times but it only took 15-20 minutes to get my order.  I ordered the creme brulee version hoping it'd be really sweet, but it wasn't. The pancakes were super soft and had a prominent egg flavour. The creme brulee sauce had a gentle flavour that perfectly complemented the egginess of the pancake instead of overpowering it. I got my sweet tooth fix from the vanilla ice cream and caramelized banana pairing.  If you're into fluffy desserts like Japanese style cheesecake, this is right up your alley.  And yes, it jiggles!"}
{"text":"I waited in line for about 15 minutes around 1pm on a Saturday - the line moved pretty fast considering how small the place actually is. I'm not really used to the set-up, and maybe it's a Japanese thing, but apparently you're supposed to go up and order, though no one bothered to tell us this. As I was about to order, the cashier turned to someone who butt in line and took her order instead, which was incredibly annoying because it led to me getting my pancakes at least 10-15 minutes after my friends did.   When my order finally arrived, it wasn't too bad, but it's not something I would try more than once. At ~$15-$19 after tax and tip, it wasn't filling either and I felt like I needed another meal to keep me going. And the other soufflé pancake place in Kensington Market gives you 3 pancakes for about the same price."}
{"text":"it was TWO hours from the moment i started lining up outside til i was actually served my first pancake. the wait was stupid LONGGGGGGGGG. majority (if not all) of us spent more time waiting than eating. they obviously could not keep up with the demand for their pancakes yet they still encouraged take out orders to those in line on top of the dine in customers. would i wait two hours for them again? NO. they messed up a couple orders which also contributed to the extended wait time but i don't understand how they did because everyone that ordered had table numbers that should match their order.   surprisingly the souffle pancakes i had in markham at dazzling cafe tasted way better than the ones at fuwa fuwa which are allegedly the first authentic souffle pancake chain from japan. i had high hopes for these and imagined them to be airy, moist and fluffy. they were not :(. yes they were a bit more risen than normal pancakes but that's about it. i was desperately looking forward to the tiramisu pancakes but of course they were sold out. i'd say other than the tiramisu pancakes, the rest would probably taste the EXACT same so the variety of pancakes is just a gimmick as well as an excuse to charge you more. i asked the cashier if i should get the raspberry pancakes or the signature and he said i should get the raspberry if i wanted a stronger flavour but the signature if i wanted something mild. my bf ordered the creme brulee one and LITERALLY the only difference between the two is that his had carmelized sugar on top and mine had three dots of raspberry sauce on the side. the \"stronger\" flavour that the cashier spoke of was non existent. in terms of the pancakes itself, they both tasted the EXACT same. they were bland with no distinct flavour on their own...."}
{"text":"The crème brûlée souffle pancake was quite good and the portion isn't too small or large, loved the hard sugar on top contrasted with the fluffy soft soufflé pancake, also it came with your choice of ice cream (matcha or vanilla). I chose the vanilla ice cream and it was lovely, not too sweet like a traditional Crème Brûlée so non sweet tooths should def give it a chance.  My friend got the Tiramisu one and it was very right, loved the deep espresso with the mascarpone, which created a fluffier and lighter texture than the actual pancake. Also the chocolate sauce they offer on the side is perfect for drizzling and controlling how much chocolate you want ( I liked that it wasn't too sweet either). I did notice the tiramisu feeling a lot heavier to consume than the Crème Brûlée so if you want more dessert choose this one     the only down side to Fuwa Fuwa is if you wanna come with a group larger than 4 prepare to wait a decent time esp bc the line up is a little long during the weekends, also seating space is very small and tight (Fuwa Fuwa is located Bloor Spadina so you can walk around and explore the stores and wait your turn, they'll call your phone to let you know that they are ready)   The system of Fuwa Fuwa is to order first (takes 20-30min to make the pancakes) and then wait for seating, this is believe to guarantee for you to eat the pancakes fresh"}
{"text":"At first I was unsure about this place because people have complained about its service being slow. Although that is true because it took 20-30 mins to receive our food, the pancakes have exceeded the quality I was expecting. The pancakes are soft and not overly thick. The amount of whip cream is balanced with fresh fruits. Nothing is too sweet and its coffee is good as well. Be mindful that the restaurant does not have many seats so I wouldn't be surprised if there are long line ups during the weekend."}
{"text":"Super nice staff and really friendly people! Wonderful food such as the creme brulee Japanese pancakes and the wonderful atmosphere I really enjoyed visiting this location my friends also enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Fuwa fuwa's Japanese soufflé pancakes are delicious!!  They're so light and fluffy they literally melt in your mouth. I love how everything here is made to order. It takes a bit of a wait but it's soooo worth it because this is unlike any other pancake you've ever had. I highly recommend the caramelized banana and green tea ice cream as a match-a (pun intended) made in heaven."}
{"text":"The restaurant/ cafe is located right off Bloor street and there is one step at the entrance. There's a bike lane and It's close to the TTC Spadina Station. There's probably parking in the area but that might be trickier to find.  I ordered the original pancakes with strawberries, banana, and blueberries. I loved it, the whipped cream and pancake are so much lighter than the Canadian version. It really is like a souffle. Everyone who worked there was nice. Just keep in mind that they're still operating under their soft launch hours so the hours might change later."}
{"text":"Maybe because they are a new kid on the block, they seemed a little chaotic on not only the process, but servers were not well trained to understand the steps and length it takes for a simple basic pancake to be ready. Questions weren't clearly answered, when asked and was soon delegated to someone who at least knows a thing or two.I Butownie points are definitely given for ' trying'. Trying to pacify customers. I always like to try the most basic classic dish whenever I head to a dessert restaurant. It's simple, if you can't even make your basic coreline well, how would your other dishes be good? Basic Japanese pancake with maple syrup. And this took 45 minutes to be ready. No toppings, no frills of fancy smeancy deco, just plain good old maple syrup with the two pancakes ordered. Maybe it was a day - Monday that I picked to come. But be warned, a minimum wait time is half an hour, so only come when you have time to kill and if you're not on a time crunch.  Seats are limited, they were doing some product photo shoot on a day that I came in. But instead of attending to your customers first. Apparently the photo shoot, takes precedence. Pancakes were made for the photo shoot first as I see three nicely decorated pancake plates were brought for the photo shoot.  When I started complaining, they told me another 10 minutes. So all in wait time for two pancakes ... Takes an hour. Or at least 45minutes. Also, the weird thing is, people who came 15 minutes after me, got theirs the same time. Now, go figure....  They're serving free pancakes in May 18 & 19. And this makes me wonder, if you cannot even cope with day to day operational needs, how would you be able to cater to mass's needs of celebrating your opening by serving free pancakes.  They were polite, apologetic & trying to appease, though, which was nice. My advice, go after the teething stage, unless time is not something you'd be concern with."}
{"text":"awesome pancakes. first time trying japanese pancakes. really fluffy and a decent amount of fruit given. little cramped but not a problem"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to their grand opening pancake giveaway yesterday. We waited about an hour in line, and was surprised that the pancakes were already made and were given a plastic plate with the pancake and big dollop of whip cream, decorated with few fruits.   The pancake... Well... it didn't look quite like the ones I have seen in other people's reviews. Ours looked more flatter and not as jiggly. The taste of the cake was bland, and very much tasted like a huge scrambled egg. Therefore, to sum it up... it was a giant fluffy scrambled egg. Definitely not worth paying regular price for it. The whip creamed tasted better than the cake itself to be honest.  HOWEVER, here comes the reason why I gave such a low rating. All 3 of us got STOMACH ACHE not long after. We suspected that because they had to make the pancakes as quickly as possible, the eggs weren't cooked through."}
{"text":"This place was super hyped up, I went with friends yesterday. The store was very small and felt very congested inside.  I ordered the creme brulee souflee pancake.  It took about 20 min or so to arrive which is not bad. At first glance it looked like perfection, I took a bite and the taste was decent but not what it was hyped up to be. It had a eggy taste,and not too sweet.   However at further glance I noticed a speck of hair on my plate. It was not mines as my hair is dyed blond.  I took a look at the staff and noticed they were not wearing hairnets.  I'm not sure if this goes against any health standards but most restaurants recquire the chefs or anyone who had direct contact with food to wear hair nets.   Additionally, my friends pancakes were half cooked. It was still raw as some of the souflee were moist and looked like batter. It was sticking on the plate.  They later told me they got stomach aches after eating it and I had stomach problems as well as throwing up.   Overall, this place has failed to impress me and I would advise not coming here. The price was pretty steep for what it was."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying soufflé pancake and Fuwa fuwa has set a high standard. I ordered their original pancake. It is so fluffy and soft. It was really good! My friend had pancake with Matcha cream and red bean. I like their matcha whipped cream as it has a matcha flavour but not too creamy. Just a perfect one to eat with this pillowy pancake.I would go back and try the creme brûlée next time!"}
{"text":"I went to this place after all of the hype on social media. We got the matcha pancake and the berries one. They are good! they are really fluffy and look amazing! (very Instagramable). I was a little disappointed? as I thought I would get a traditional pancake flavor?, however it tastes just like Japanese cheesecake.  The attention is very good! They are very kind and receive you with a big smile :)   It is a little bit overpriced for what you get. Also,? the place is very very small, they only have 3-4 tables and no A/C! but it's definitely? worth trying it once (not twice)."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday afternoon. It is a very tiny spot with about 4 tables, all of which were taken.   I ordered the Signature option with vanilla ice cream.The pancakes were light and fluffy. They weren't that sweet, which is great! All the toppings were also light and fresh. Overall the pancakes and the ice cream were delicious, but what bothered me is the strong eggy smell of the pancakes. They smelled like a pan on which you made omelettes and left in the sink for a few hours, which in my opinion was very unpleasant and disrupted the experience as a whole.  I am not sure if I will be back considering the smell and the steep prices."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Japanese Dessert fan and this is probably my favorite place in Toronto. Travelled from California to Toronto with my girlfriend last weekend for vacation, dropped by Fuwa Fuwa for some dessert, their tiramisu pancake was marvelously delicious. All I can say is \"OMG this is phenomenal\"!  These pancakes have to be heaven on earth! Will definitely revisit Toronto JUST FOR Fuwa Fuwa!!"}
{"text":"We waited for an hour and half and still hasn't been seated. They are just not equipped with the staff and cooking equipment to be able to handle the influx of people from their promotional stunt. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I asked about the Fuwa Fuwa secret menu, and they said they have now changed it from strawberries forest to peach peach forest. I tried the peach dessert a lot of time in Japan and this peach dessert is not disappointing at all but taste just like what I had in Tokyo! Good job guys  Food: pancakes are Light as air, fluffy as cloud  Ambiance: people are happy and they love the food. The place is a little bit hot though. And table are close to each other.  Services: Good looking staff, extra credits   Tips: Ask about the secret menu. It is made fresh every time you order so it takes a bit longer and it is limited in quantity every day."}
{"text":"It was delicious very different from traditional western pancakes. It was very light and fluffy and perfect with whipping cream on the side. The place is very cozy and inviting, great place for girls afternoon tea."}
