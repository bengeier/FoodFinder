{"text":"I wish there was a way I could give it 0 stars...  We went tonight, ordered off the menu (of course)...waitress didn't even understand what we were trying to order.  It's funny, Burrito Supreme is exactly how it is written on the menu.  Waited 40 minutes for the food to arrive before we finally got up and walked out.  The place wasn't busy at all (maybe 3 tables plus us).  I won't go back, recommend you don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the better TexMex restaurants in the area. The portions are big, the presentation is great, and the salsa is just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"I'm not much on eating El Mexicano, but this place was quite good.   I had steak fajitas and they were outstanding.  Nice portion size and friendly service.  The prices were lower than expected.  Also, the salsa was delicious!  Three thumbs up!  Edit: the last three times I've gone there, it has gone way downhill.  Cold fajitas, funny tasting beans & burned chips this last time.  I can no longer recommend this place.  Sanitation score of 90.5 too!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Mexican restaurants and they're my guilty-pleasure-go-to food joints.  I was extremely excited when Cactus Rose closed and I saw a sign for a new Mexican Restaurant (El Patron).  Every time I would go grocery shopping, I'd drive by El Patron eagerly anticipating it's opening.  Today, we finally got a chance to experience the dining and I was NOT disappointed.  The decor inside the restaurant is beautiful and elegant.  It feels like you're in Guadalajara at an actual Mexican restaurant, but you still get to enjoy the \"Americanized\" cheesy goodness we've come to know as Mexican food.  We ordered the chimichanga lunch special # 16, and the tacos lunch special # 6.  These were definitely average dishes, but I happen to enjoy average, and they were really good.  The chimichanga came smothered in cheese sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream (a must) served with rice.  Not one complaint or flaw about the taste or seasoning.  The beef tacos were about 50% beef and 50% cheese.  In my eyes, this was a little too much cheese for the average taco and I would have preferred some tomatoes, but the taco was seasoned well, and for $5.25, who can complain?  The chips and salsa were also average, but delicious.  The chips were crisped to perfectness and the salsa came in mild & medium (in my eyes), which was great because my husband likes mild and I prefer the spicy.  The hostess was very kind, prompt with water and ordering, but the service itself was slow for a \"mexican restaurant\" (i.e the food was served 10 minutes after ordering instead of 2 minutes).  I actually enjoyed the more laid back service as it gave my husband and myself a more enjoyable, relaxing experience.    Will I go back?  You bet!!  Are there coupons?!?!  I haven't found any yet, but I'll keep on checking back."}
{"text":"This location has been through 2 other franchises, and management. So far so good with El Patron! They improved the overall look on the inside. Much larger eating area and a nice bar. The food was very good, and the portion sizes were huge! The one thing, I could say, needs some improvement, is the waiter/waitresses. I believe once everyone gets settled in, it will be much better!"}
{"text":"This is our local go to spot for Mexican. We have gone here about once a week for the last few months. New renovated with a nice big bar and lots of seating. The owners are always there working and do a great job with service and food. Salsa and guac is amazing! Staff is always attentive as well.   Keep up the great service El Patron!"}
{"text":"They just opened a few days ago so I figured I'd check out.  Nice open place with huge booths, long L shape bar which is where I sat.  The bar stools are nice but either they are short or the bar is tall...felt sorta like a kid sitting there almost reaching up.  Was greeted promptly by a nice young man, I asked about beer prices (drafts) which took asking several people.  They did have Dos Equis draft $2.50 for a 16 ounce so excellent!  Salsa and chips were good but average, I asked about some salsa verde which seemed to cause some confusion and they don't have any. :(   Anyway, ordered the basic #11 (oddly this combo is almost always the same items no matter where you go), I really enjoyed it.  I got all beef and while the beef itself could have had a little more flavor, the sauces were excellent...  Right now they need more training, especially if they get busier as several questions took a group for an answer, and it took a while to get my check and pay.  I'll be back in a couple weeks, hopefully they will be working the bugs out."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service.  This restaurant was a little understaffed but has been excellent after the first week or so.   The decor is nice and every dish we have tried has been excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely worst service and food ever. So I am a regular of Mexican restaurants. I have found good and bad Mexican, this one is probably the worst.  The margaritas (you can only get lime flavor) are made from a mix and are not worth the money. The corn chips are the same as you get anywhere and the salsa is runny and gross. The staff is very unorganized. They take exceedingly long and bring the food out not all at once but in bits and pieces. My wife ordered a fajita and they forgot the tortillas. My 6 year old ordered a number six and the barely able to speak English waiter brought out a number two (burrito) and then had brought out a number 5. Since the order was still wrong - he had him pull out the fried chicken fingers out of the gross beans while he went back to make the fries. He then tried taking my margarita when I wasn't finished.  50 dollars wasted. Don't waste your time or money. Taco Bell is a much better investment than this crappy place."}
{"text":"Food is decent, about on par with most other Mexican places.  Generally same menu as you see in the other generic Mexican restaurants, same dishes and combo platters.    The disappointment was that the service was extremely slow, and the place wasn't even half full the night we went.  The order was messed up and then they messed up the bill.    Definitely better options around for a quick Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Great food, love the staff, my food comes very quickly. Have had a number of dishes and never disappointed!! Shrimp dishes are my favorite, fresh, large and crisp to cut or bite into. Highly recommend the chicken soup, the Fajitas Texanas and two shrimp dishes I have had that I really enjoy."}
{"text":"Not my favorite.... or even close.... the chips were ok and the salsa is ok but the food is not Mexican by any stretch of the imagination.   I stopped in during my son's music lessons in the same shopping center for a quick bite and I'm sorry to sal that it was a let down.... I ordered the chicken tacos which are served on a soft flour shell (no bueno) and smothered in shredded American white cheese.  They charge extra for sour cream (really no bueno). They have inexpensive cocktails (which I didn't try) but I imagine would be a draw and they have a full bar.   The presentation of the tacos was enough for me to know that this was not my type of restaurant.  I will probably not be back unless given a specific recommendation.  But by first impression, this is not Mexican food.  Sorry"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best,  with really slow service. But the really big square plates are very cool."}
{"text":"Very spacious restaurant with modern warm decor. Inviting bar area with several large televisions. Mix of Lively Spanish music playing on monitors and sports on others.  Menu is very basic. Has a restaurant chain feel.   My daughter ordered the quesadilla. She took one bite and refused to eat the rest. It was not made with the Mexican cheese she is used to.  I ordered three tacos. Options were hard or soft filled with either chicken or beef. I went with soft chicken tacos. Soft is flour tortillas. (At this point, I realized if soft corn tortillas are not an option, then I should not expect true authentic Mexican food cooking here.) Trimmings are lettuce and mixed cheeses. I only ate one. Shredded chicken was bland. Not a fan of flour tacos.  Rice and refried beans were more of an authentic Mexican flavor. Passable.  Only salsa offerings is red- tomato base in mild or hot. No green salsa, if you prefer that one.    It was carryout and came with fresh chips, which was the only item I liked.   If you like a very toned down version of Mexican food in a nice warm spacious setting to include a large bar area with big tv's, then this would do it for you. Not what I am looking for when I want to eat \"Mexican\" food."}
{"text":"Great dinner. Pollo loco was very satisfying as was the beef chimichanga. We'll go back."}
{"text":"I would give this place negative stars if I could. First, we walked in and waited 5 minutes to be seated, there were two couples already seated. Not a single waitress was in sight. Finally one comes out, doesn't say a word to us but apparently expected us to follow her. We sit down and she takes our drink order and she brings our drinks back with some chips and salsa. I ask for mild salsa because I don't like spicy salsa. It took her 13 minutes to bring it back. She basically tosses it down and goes to another table despite 2 other people in my group voicing that we were ready for her to take our order. I ordered the lunch fajitas, my mom ordered a chilli poblano, and my sister ordered a beef burrito with no cheese sauce, just red sauce. Right after she took our order I asked for a refill and she never brought it back. I had to go refill my drink myself. The food came out relatively fast but it was TERRIBLE! The lunch fajita was literally just charred steak, onions and peppers with refried beans. No sour cream or guacamole and it was placed on a plate, it didn't come out on a skillet. The \"chilli poblano\" was just a green pepper, not a poblano pepper, it wasn't battered like it's supposed to be and they thought it was supposed to be stuffed with beef. That's a chilli relleno that's supposed to be stuffed with beef. The burrito came out with brown sauce, not red sauce. The waitress brought out some ice cold red salsa that's supposed to be for chips. We asked to speak to the manager. And he explained that the lunch fajita NEVER comes with sour cream and guacamole(you ain't gunna last long then) and the cooks must have mixed up the peppers in the back. We will NEVER be going back there."}
{"text":"We took friends from out of town...service was horrible and the salsa was out of a can and bland...so was everyone's meal...yuk....never to go back."}
{"text":"El Patron was the saltiest Mexican food I have ever had. Not only that but I ordered a bean, cheese, and rice burrito. Standard right? First time they brought it with red sauce so I had them remake it. Second time they brought it back with white sauce after I repeated that I only wanted 3 ingredients. I did not have them remake it a third time because I was so over it and hungry at that point. The burrito was very sub par. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food was cold and when I requested to heat it back up, it was still cold.  Very bland food for a Mexican restaurant.  Service was average if at best."}
{"text":"I like to give a new restaurant at least 3-months to get its bearing before going live with an opinion.  That said, this location has been \"live\" since September, so I stopped in yesterday for a bite.  I am happy to report I had a great experience. This place is exactly what a neighborhood Tex Mex place should be, or aspire to be:  Convenient location, friendly service, clean environment, good and fresh food, and affordable.  I have no special interest in posting this review, save for my desire to support local, small businesses (and to keep a local Mexican restaurant within a stone's throw distance for those nights that the wife and I don't feel like cooking, and seek a decent meal at a decent price)."}
{"text":"Food and staff are normally great but Cinco de Mayo clearly caught them by surprise.  25 min wait for table which is fine but waiting another 50+ min in addition for food with 3 children on tow.  Sure hope they can get it together.    6-9-16. Came back a month later and service was slow to non-existent.  The place was empty when we arrived.  Items were forgotten. Kept having to ask for refills on chips, salsa, and drinks.  Food was super slow arriving in spurts and one meal wasn't correct.  Instead of offering to replacing it, we were offered queso to put on it.  They did take it off the meal because we were ready to go by that point.  Off to a great start so not sure what has happened but we will most likely not be back.  It's a great location and a new owner could do well with the right food and staff."}
{"text":"After reading some earlier reviews, we weren't quite sure what to expect but ventured to El Patron last Saturday to give it a try. Contrary to other posts, we found the waiting staff to be wonderful. It seemed like many of them were new or fresh off of recent training (which again, may have stemmed from some earlier reviews). Good to think they may be taking the feedback and actually working on improving! The food was great, my margarita was awesome and our server Gabe was helpful but not overbearing. Even the hostess stepped in to keep things running smoothly by helping to refill chips, etc. We will definitely be going back! Oh, and we didn't wait longer than 10-15 minutes for food. It was perfect!"}
