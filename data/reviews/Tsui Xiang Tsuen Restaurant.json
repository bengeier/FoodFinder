{"text":"Went back again recently and I found the food to be only acceptable this time around.  The beef ho fun was huge again in terms of portions but the beef was far too chewy and didn't taste very good either.  I could only eat a small portion of it.  Disappointing after having several good meals here."}
{"text":"Reminds me of First Markham Place and the Dragon Centre. There are plenty of menu items and the portions are insane!   I ordered the spicy fried fish on fried rice based on one of the reviews here, and it was soooo goooood. And I'm not kidding about the portions. The container couldn't even be closed. I pigged out, and there was still enough leftover for my husband to have for dinner....for $7.50 cash. Wut.   This is going to be a regular spot from now on. Next time, I'm getting the beef ho fun. It looked so good when I was there (others ordered it) but I didn't have enough cash!   Next time, I'm bringing more cash!!"}
{"text":"Won Ton Noodle soup for $6.00, Ma Po Tofu with rice for $7.50 and Shrimp and Lobster sauce on rice for $7.50 is our take-out dinner tonight; taxes extra and cash payment only.  Great service and food.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Tsui Xiang Tsuen is located in the food court of the Mississauga Chinese Centre (a.k.a. Sino Mall).  Like I mentioned in another review, the food court at the Mississauga Chinese Centre is like a much smaller, dirtier and sadder version of the food court at First Markham Place.  It's all independent vendors, no big name chains.     I went here with my parents and we got food from different vendors and then shared.  At Tsui Xiang Tsuen we got the Cantonese Chow Mein ($6.95).  My parents enjoyed it but I didn't like it all that much.    The noodles tasted a bit rancid to me.  Like either the wheat used to make the noodles was old, or the oil used to fry the noodles was old.  I was surprised by this because this vendor seemed to be the busiest of all the vendors in the food court.  Anyway, the noodles were not that crispy and tasted stale to me.  The toppings though were good.  The Cantonese Chow Mein had BBQ pork, chicken, shrimp and squid in it, as well as carrots, onions, and bok choy.  The portion was large.    They have a hot tea dispenser where you can help yourself to free hot tea.  Like I said, this vendor was the most popular, so maybe we just got a dud of a dish.  I would not order the Cantonese Chow Mein again here.      FYI: They do catering.  When we were there, we saw some people come and pick up huge platters of food."}
{"text":"Iv been coming here for years! Iv gotten the same exact thing and thats the Spicy Fried Fish with fried rice. I am IN LOVE WITH IT!  The fish is battered and fried with chilli's on it and it comes with seafood sauce (which I usually get on the side). It also comes with bokchoy but I go without. They also have really really good chicken wings and general tao. Great price for what you get! Always come here when Im feeling a bit of Chinese."}
{"text":"Large amounts of food for a cheap price.  Tucked inside the mall at Mississauga Chinatown, this small but amazing restaurant is where you will find some great chinese food.  If you look at the place you'd be like HELL no but when you see so many people ordering from this place you just know somethings up. And of course there is, the food is very cheap and if you were to order just one dish it can easily feed a family of four for less than $5. I know what you're thinking, its cheap so it must not taste that good. Well you're wrong the quality of the food is excellent almost up to par with some of the top Chinese restaurants in the GTA.  The two ladies at the front are very sweet. If you've never gone here you would think that they are very aggressive b/c they're always trying to attract customers by shoving their menu in your face. But trust me they are not, very friendly and love to chat it up when they're not busy.  There is a wide variety of food available; noodles, rice dishes, sweet and sour items, soup, deep fried goodness. They also offer huge party trays for a very good price.  Items to definetly get  - wonton noodle soup - shanghai noodles - japanese udon noodles - singapore noodles - shrimp fried rice - beef ho fun - deep fried spicy squid"}
{"text":"I had some type of black bean beef on top of rice noodles. It arrived piping hot and the serving was huge.  Noodles were really overcooked though and some of the pieces of beef were a bit on the rare side.  However, if I'm back that way again, I'll order something else because Ted B.'s pics of the black pepper chicken and spicy calamari with fried rice looked awesome."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years,  Hot and sour soup - they changed the bowls to larger bowls but it's now paper so it falls through the take away cup pretty fast - but it's very flavourful and authentic  I've had lots of other items but the chow mien has changed maybe the oil is old but sometimes the chow mien doesn't taste that great   ON THE WEEKEND CHOW MIEN IS ALWAYS GOOD   wonton soup big portions lots of wontons   It's always the busiest location in the food court and they offer catering take out.   Been at least 7 years I been coming here as an adult, my mom used to take me here when I was a child and teen as well  Huge selection you can't go wrong  6.50 for a chow mien and most other dishes that can feed 2 people huge servings   4.50 for most soups"}
{"text":"Love going here before work. Their rice with lobster sauce is great. Lots of variety unless you go here all the time then you're probably used to it haha!"}
