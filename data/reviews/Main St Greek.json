{"text":"Unlike usual Greek spots, you walk into Main Street Greek and you feel comfortable. The decor is simple yet fresh. It's a small restaurant but it feels spacious, so it's nice and quaint. 

Prices aren't bad but not cheap. Food was fresh, which is a high priority for me. 

We tried one of the dips, the pork souvlaki dinner, and the spanakopita. Warm garlic bread was served once we ordered, along with a bottle of tap water. 

The pork souvlaki was the tastiest out of the three items. Very tender and juicy! The dip came with warm pita bread, yum! The spanakopita, though, was a bit cold and hard. 

All in all, it was a nice experience. Food was good and service was friendly. Plus they serve some of the foods on pretty plates!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in tonight and wow!! This place is better than anything on the Danforth. Had the pork gyro my girlfriend had the chicken gyro, both very tender and juicy pieces of meat with fries, very generous portions, great quality and priced very reasonably. 
Decor was nice and modern. Excellent service, staff very friendly. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The fried calimari was so fresh and soooo good. Best greek food i ever had!  Coming here again when im craving greek."}
{"text":"Love love love the pork gyros. Lots of flavour, even though I got some really \"roasted\" pieces it was never burned or dried out.  So yummy"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek food in Markham!! Amazing food and great decor for a cute lunch or dinner out. And their Greek fries are to die for! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Delicious pork gyros that melts in your mouth. Huge portions and the dinner takeout is so generous with delicious potatoes and rice. The tzatziki is made in house, thick, garlicky and authentic. I don't recommend the calamari, I was surprised it wasn't that good since I believe they have ties to Mezes Greek restaurant on the Danforth. I didn't like the chicken kebabs, too dry. The spanakopita could be improved, the filo pastry was undercooked and a little soggy. Then again I'm comparing it to Athens Pastries so that could be unfair."}
{"text":"The salad was drenched with salad dressing and the food was quite salty. Ordered a side of fries but they were like Costco breaded fries, not your typical fries that you get a Greek restaurants. Service was quick though."}
{"text":"Glad to see a great quality Greek restaurant open up near my house.

I had the chicken souvlaki wrap and it was delicious.

The portion size was generous and the price reasonable.

A great addition to Main St. Markham."}
{"text":"Owner, Danny, made me a GF meal. Excellent food!!! Ate grilled octopus... soooo tender & delicious!! Greek Salad had tons of yummy feta (FYI, didn't want olives and onions). Will definitely be back!! Opa!!!"}
{"text":"A favourite on Main St, this family-run Greek joint keeps the feta fresh and pork souvlaki tender. I always get the greek fries when I'm here - it has a unique zest to it that is just Nothing here feels greasy or too heavy, there's definitely a balance of flavour and quality present in every item. Staff here are friendly and keep the glasses full and free bread coming."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4.  We ordered pork gyro in a pita ($6) and my dad, chicken in a pita ($7). We also added a side of fries for $3. 

The food portions were generous and proportion of meat in the gyro was awesome. The fries were really good - simple but crispy. My only feedback about the pork gyro is that it was more greasy than I'd like. I wasn't impressed with the price of a can of pop which was $2 so stuck with the water. 

The place itself wasn't busy and got a seat right away.  It was clean and service attentive. I love the location just along Main St Markham. 

I'll definitely be back. I hope this place keeps up with the good service and generous portions - if so, I'm sure I'll become a regular!"}
{"text":"I've visited twice in two weeks and both times have turned out good. Both visits combined we had ordered the pork gyro dinner, main st burger, chicken souvlaki dinner, and chicken gyro dinner. They come with a generous amount of rice, potatoes, and salad. The potatoes are made to have a sour taste which I prefer, its not as filling as regular potatoes. You also get a side of grilled buttered bread for the table.

The chicken souvlaki is my favorite as it's really juicy and flavourful. I favour the pork gyro over the chicken gyro because it has more flavour. The gyros are not as juicy as the souvlaki since they are cooked differently. I had made the mistake of ordering the burger from a Greek place. Stick with what the restaurant specialty is.

The service was great both times. The only thing that's keeping this from being a 5 star is the wait time for our mains. Other than that I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious, best Greek place in town.

Ordered a spanakopita, chicken souvlaki, and pork gyro. The spanakopita was good and the portion was reasonable. It came with 2 pieces (each about the size of a hand) and had a good pastry to filling ratio. However, there was price discrepancy for the spanakopita, on the menu it is listed for $4.50, the board in store was listed as $4.75, but when the bill came it was actually $5. The chicken souvlaki was seasoned well, moist, and the Tzatziki on the side was delicious. The best item was the pork gyro, it was fresh, seasoned and cooked perfectly, and PACKED full of meat, and a very good price. The only thing I would prefer is maybe some lettuce but that's just personal preference. There are very few Greek places in North Scarborough and Markham and am glad to have found this one. Will definitely come back!

As an aside, the decor was very nice (quiet and cafe like) and the restaurant was clean. The woman who served us which I assume is one of the owners was also very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm 3 1/2 stars on this. Most of the time the food is amazing and the service is at par. But there's been a few times where the potatoes were mushy, the chicken was too fatty (gyro). But the other 99 times it's been great. The price seems a bit on the higher side of Greek food - I would say around 20% more than other similar Greek restaurants in the same area. But it's the best restaurant in Markham when it comes to the Greek kitchen and they are always busy so I can't be the only one feeling that way."}
{"text":"Walked out because no one served us!! Even though there was only 1 table of 2 ppl in the whole restaurant, they didn't acknowledge us for 5 mins. When you're hungry and the restaurant is dead, 5 minutes wait feels like an eternity. Therefore, we decided to leave and as we reached the door, the lady behind the counter says: Thank you for coming! Ummm right? All I said to her was; oh no! We didn't eat or order. There was no service? 

Too bad! Because I've been there once and the food was good. I'll give it another try next time I'm craving for greek food in Markham. I mean, what a bad feeling to feel pressured to tip a server when the service is bad or excited to eat at a restaurant but nobody wants to serve you?"}
{"text":"The pork souvlaki in the pita sandwich was moist.  I can see myself craving the sandwich later on... the fries inside the sandwich made it even more appealing.  My husband had the lemon chicken soup.  Refreshing yet comforting.  
Very friendly service and cute interior. I can imagine this place would be a nice casual date spot especially with the gelato place across the street."}
{"text":"Came here a few nights ago with a bunch of friends. I reserved in advance for a table of 8. The interior is really cute, just a simple eat-in and take out diner. 

We ordered a variety of the appetizers such as the calamaria, squid, the three dips as well as greek poutine. The spinach dip was the best. 

For the main course, I had the chicken souvlaki. The entrees came with a large greek salad, potatoes and rice. I like how their potatoes aren't saturated with oil. The rice was also very flavourful and moist. I also tried the chicken gyros and my friend's mousaka. Overall, the meats were really juicy and tender. My favourite was definitely the mousaka, which reminded me of shepherds pie. The portions are also really big too. Will definitely come back next time!"}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday lunch after wanting to try out this place for the longest time. The restaurant is in the heart of Main Street Markham. The decor of the restaurant is simple but comfortable.

My wife and I were seated and given a bottle of cold water, which was much appreciated on such a hot summer day. We ordered a chicken souvlaki  with a side of fries and a pork souvlaki as well.

Both the sandwiches were excellent and the meat and the toppings were fresh. The fries could have been better, as they weren't really seasoned. 

The service was good and the waitress was attentive and polite. I would definitely return when I have a craving for Greek!"}
{"text":"Some context before you read on: I've had my fair share of Greek fare from around the world and a lot homemade from my Mom.

Came here ravenous and expected something to be on par with Loui's Kouzina, but left with major disappointment. 

Ordered the pork gyro main ($14) and the chicken souvlaki main ($15). Take out portions were pretty small (lots of empty space in the aluminum containers) and the salad literally consisted of 75% ice burg lettuce,  1/4 of a small tomato, couple of slices of green bell peppers, a small sprinkling of feta, and a meager addition of olives. The potatoes were good, but not  special in any sort.

The pork gyro is something you'd expect from Jimmy the Greek, but wasn't seasoned very well. The chicken souvlaki, on the other hand, was delicious, but I do think serving sizes could be improved for this price point. Rice was really good as well (much better than Loui's) and the salad was alright (mall food is about the same quality). 

All in all, I think the flavour's there somewhat, but the prices could be reduced to make up for \"smaller\" serving size. Their salad is a bit pitiful. 

Don't think I'll be returning..."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Came here for a weekday dinner and got the Greek fries and pork souvlaki dinner with rice and potatoes. There was so much food we couldn't finish. The pork was cooked perfectly so juicy and tender. 
I usually go to Louis kouzina on woodbine for Greek because it is closer to home. The food here blows them out of the water the service quality is about the same (pretty good) but the food here is way better and worth the distance. 
This is a great Greek restaurant the value for money is amazing I would not even care if they raised the prices cause it was that good."}
{"text":"Excellent value.  I come for the chicken and pork gyro all the time. Good price for portion."}
{"text":"Holy Hera!!! What a meal! I wasn't sure what to expect when I ventured into Main St Greek last week but the end result was absolutely worthy of the gods! Truth be told there are a lot of would-be greek restaurants in the 905 (cough cough... Mr. Greek) who are Greek only in branding but the food and experience fall flat. Having visited the islands of Greece as well as Athens, I can safely say I'm confident I can spot the real deal from afar.

Main St Greek is as real as they get. From the simple design of the business, which reminds me of many restaurants I visited around Athens, to the hearty delicious portions to the staff who, after speaking with them I came to realise are ACTUALLY from Greece, and not just anywhere in Greece... Rhodes!!!

We were just stopping in for lunch and while it's not as fancy as some downtown spots they're focused on executing the classic on a high level. We went for the Gyros (Yee-ros) me the pork, she the chicken and shared a Greek Salad. 

Meals came quick and man was they ever massive and authentic. Unlike many greek restaurants, the Gyros was actually shaved/chopped meat was taken right off the spit (instead of little thin slices) the pork had excellent crackling on it and was so juicy. The meat was loaded into the pita heavy and topped with my choices of toppings. The real authentic piece that sold me on the Gyros pita was seeing french fries mixed into the gyro and topping. Sounds weird but that's how they do it in Greece folks - and it's excellent.

Salad and Tzatziki were also very well done. I really enjoyed my experience here at Main St Greek and I cannot wait to come back again soon to try out more of their menu

Efcharistó (thank you)

Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Tried this cute little spot in Main Street Markham a little before Christmas with my boyfriend. The interior is very simple, clean and modern. The food is moderately priced and the portions come fairly big. We both didn't finish our meals and were stuffed like turkey when we left. We highly recommend the pork gyro!"}
{"text":"Great Gyros!!! Trust me! No need to drive down to the Danforth anymore. So nice to have these guys right here in Markham.

The pork Gyro is amazing, the meat is cooked just right where it's got crisp but still juicy. Add that together with all the stuffings including fries, game over.

We've always wanted more selection in our neighbourhood so it's great to have Main St Greek in our backyard.

And don't forget to finish it off with a Baklava!

As of this review it has a perfect 5 star rating for a reason. I really hope they get enough traffic to stick around and become a staple on Main St."}
{"text":"Great local joint and our go to place for Greek food. Fresh food, delicious and friendly staff"}
{"text":"A much needed addition to an area littered with Italian restaurants.  The place has a nice decor and is spotless.  Most importantly the food here is spectacular.  It has authentic Greek dishes like moussaka and grilled octopus, both of which are incredible.  Gyros and souvlaki on a pita both have fries stuffed in them which is how it should be.  You rarely find this in supposed Greek restaurants, so it's nice to see someone finally doing it. What I'm most impressed by is that they actually use pork tenderloin for their souvlaki,  most places use some disgusting throw away pork product from their food source and have the nerve to sell a fatty inedible piece of meat.

Service is very friendly, price and portion are perfect.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"For the sake of full disclosure, I typically don't care from Greek food. Maybe it's just because I've been hustled by friends with questionable tastes into sub par experiences. Whatever the case may be, my hopes were not super high when walking into Main St. Greek. 
I was in a rush to get some quick lunch, so I stuck with a standard and ordered a chicken gyro. (\"Euro\"? \"Giro\"? Whatever floats your boat.) After a short wait, I was pleasantly surprised with how deeply satisfying this gyro was. It's served on thick pita bread, spread with a healthy amount of tzatziki, sprinkled with diced tomatoes and onions, and heaping with chicken and fries. Though the ingredients seem pretty simple, it started to nudge my emotions a bit with the flavourful, yet still mild tzatziki. (I've been bored by simply mild tzatziki way too many times before.) I have to thank the guys at Main St. for the borderline unreasonable amount of chicken that they pack in this guy. They're fighting the good fight against skimpy meat portions. Bless them.

Aside from the food, the decor of the restaurant is really nice to look at. There are large windows bordering much of the space, and the decor in general has a simple, clean feel. I'd be happy to come back and see how much I enjoy the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight.   Just walking in the smell will get you.

This place is really good.  From the friendly staff to the delicious food, this place us definately going to be a repeat.    

Starters we had hummus, greek sausage and spanakopita.   Spanakopita was fresh and crispy and sausage was packed with flavour.   1 suggestion dont fill up on the tasty bread.   Dinners here are very large portions.  

Food takes a little long to arrive, but it is worth the wait  I had the lamb (lil dry but very tasty) my wife had the souvlaki  chicken , that was really good.   Really nice flavour and chicken was cooked very nicely . just a warning, portions are quite large.  I was pretty full before the mains even arrived.

I am surprised this place didnt get very busy, i was there around 7.   I would definately go again, this is a great spot with great food and great people."}
{"text":"I was slightly disappointed with how long it took for the food to arrive. It was 6:45pm on a Sunday evening and there were only two other tables filled at the time. 

Thankfully, the food made up for it. I had a chicken gyro on a pita and it was great! It was actually better than the one I had during Taste of Danforth (annual Greek street festival in Toronto). Filled to the brim with shredded chicken, tomatoes, fries, and this delicious sauce, it was super filling! The chicken had a very tasty rotisserie-smoky flavour to it while the onion-white sauce really tied everything together so it wasn't too dry.

The atmosphere was also surprisingly nice. I thought it was just a self-serve fast food joint but it turned out to be a very comfy and modern looking sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"Bad food even worse service do not waste your money or time. Staff do not care 

Watery bland salad, dry gyro. Server did not come to our table at all, we assign based on our body language and not eating our food they could tell we did not enjoy it. when she finally came to bring the bill we told her how unhappy we were she said she would speak with management and then just did not come back to the table at all. After 10 mins of waiting for our bill we finally went to the counter to pay. The server had not spoke to anyone about our complaint and just avoided the issues all together

When we sat down the table beside us was also complaining and the server avoided there table as well 

Bad food is one thing and kitchens have bad days but terrible service and the experience we have is awful"}
{"text":"Decoration isn't dated or tacky like most Greek restaurants. Very modern and well lit. Menu had all the Greek staples and done very well. Had the chicken gyro dinner and it came with garlic bread (on it's own), Greek salad (on it's own plate, the feta cheese was good ), and a plate of  rice and potatoes with the chicken. Portion was big and definitely worth the $15 especially when you compare it to Jimmy the Greek etc. Tldr version would be this is for sure my go to Greek establishment now."}
{"text":"Love this place they have amazing authentic food. They are huge portions too I can hardly finish when I order my own plate. The last time I came I think their ac was broken so it was super hot in there but other than that little hiccup. I would deg come back for food."}
{"text":"The service was good and friendly. Gyro pork was a bit dry, but the chicken souvlaki was perfect and moist."}
{"text":"I came here with a party of 10 for dinner and we reserved a spot a few days ahead of time. It was a small restaurant so I was afraid we would be tight on space, but they set up a nice long table near the window for us and everyone sat comfortably. The restaurant decor was clean and simplistic, it felt very Greek with the blues, whites and occasional Opas! 

We ordered a few appetizers to share - the hummus, olives and cheese plate and calamari. For my main, I ordered the chicken gyro pita ($7). My friend couldn't decide between the pork or chicken gyro pita so the waitress suggested that she get a mix of both meats in the pita! The rest of my party ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner ($16) and the mousaka ($16). 

The food came in such a timely manner! The appetizers were delicious, they gave complimentary garlic bread and warm pita which was so yummy with the hummus. I loved my chicken gyro pita! There was so much meat and every piece was tender with some crispy bits. Usually I am not a fan of white sauces (I know... I'm weird) but the tzatziki sauce added a nice richness that wasn't overwhelming. It was exciting to get a bite with some fries in it, they definitely add points for awesomeness to the pita! At the end, we were all full and extremely satisfied. Some of us had to bring home leftovers because the portion sizes for the meals were huge. 

I hope to go to Greece one day but for now, Main St Greek shall be my little escape to Greece!"}
{"text":"Literally the best gyro I have had outside of Greece. Pork gyro is Devine.  I can only hope they remain consistent with the quality and offering size."}
{"text":"Ok if you read my reviews I don't hand out a lot of 5 stars. So this is a must read.

So this date night and we're out for Greek. Found this little gem on Main Street. Not much to look at. Looks like a Greek diner. 
Self seating. Super friendly staff hands you a menu. (1st star)
Ordering takes place again very helpful staff. Food comes out uber fast (2nd star). 
We ordered a large Greek salad ($10), extra kalamata olives($5), a pork gyro($6) and a grilled octopus($15). Ok prices seemed fair. Until I actually saw the grilled octopus. It was 1 tentacle. 
I was like WTF I'm paying $15 for 1 tentacle of an octopus? Most places give you a whole small octopus for that price! 
Then I took a bite. OMG I was back in Mykonos and all of the Greek isles! (3 stars for the food, while I'll admit 2 of 3 was for that tentacle)
I decided I'm totally willing to pay the price for that mouth watering, tender, fresh piece of octopus. 
I'm definitely going back if nothing for that tentacle alone!"}
{"text":"Always have a great experience here. Staff are always so kind and the food is fantastic. Price is definitely worth the portion size. 

Greek Fries and Calamaria apps are a MUST TRY. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was here with my family and brother over the long Thanksgiving weekend (Sunday night around 7pm). This restaurant opened it's doors in April 2016.  We like Greek food and decided to give it a try. It's a restaurant with take out counter. It's clean and the staff is pretty friendly. They offered complimentary garlic bread to start....for our meal we ordered Chicken and Pork Souvlaki dinners, Greek Fries and Calamari. The food was very fresh and the portions are decent, except the calamari dish which i found to be abit small for the price. The dinners come with potato, rice and salad.  The only thing I didn't like was the smell because it's an open concept kitchen so the food smell travels into the dining room. It was a bit smoky i found as more people came into the restaurant and the kitchen was busy cooking other meals. They close at 8pm on Sundays so get here early if you don't want to feel rushed. The server gave us our bill even though we didn't ask for it. We took our time and didn't pay for it right away because I was waiting for my son to finish his meal. There is street parking available (at no cost). It's a nice location and you can stroll along old main street Markham after filling your bellies. We would come back again the next time we want Greek."}
{"text":"Excellent experience here when I went the other day with my friend.  The server was super nice and attentive and the food was absolutely amazing.

We started with he Greek salad and it was absolutely fresh with good quality ingredients such as cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, olives, and big pieces of feta cheese that was to die for.  We had the Greek fries which were done to perfection again the Feta cheese is what makes all the difference in the world.  We ordered the pork gyro and it was flavourful and absolutely worth trying.  It was an absolutely amazing experience and would have no hesitation in going back."}
{"text":"Really fresh and delicious chicken souvlaki. My new favourite as this place has a modern and fresh vibe to it but also is very traditional in its family warmth and service."}
{"text":"Really good gyros and souvlaki on pita's.  Greek said was just ok, could be better but overall excellent quality food and nice decor. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Opa! Where there is an unsuspecting Greek Restaurant (and almost generic) on Main St lies some amazing authentic Greek food. 

I came here with my friend who is Greek and says this place is as good as it gets. And he's not wrong. I'm really impressed and would easily make this my go to place for Greek food in Markham. 

As you come in, the place is simple, clean, and modern and are greeted by friendly staff here. I loved their menu and we went the saganaki appetizer and the souvlaki on a pita for our main course.

It was my first time having saganaki and it is a must-order if you like cheese. It is served table side and is flambeed, with a squeeze of lemon. Our waitress said Opa! As she did this. The cheese is Greek goat cheese and is quite sharp tasting, almost like cheddar. Since it is fried, it has a nice crust on it that is crisp. It is on the saltier side, but cheese is sometimes like that so I understand. It tastes absolutely amazing with their garlic loaf here. 

Their souvlaki on a pita was really good. The pork was really juicy. Everything was really fresh and you could tell. There was a good amount of tomatoes there and the tzatziki sauce was also sublime. I loved how there were french fries in the pita it just shows how authentic this place is!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come here for ages. I went for the first time last night and every table was filled. Good sign!

We must have waited over 10 minutes to receive menus and only did because my dad complained to the people behind the bar. 

Our waiter was nice but she was a really terrible waitress. Didn't bring enough glasses and then didn't bring enough menus. My mom ordered an app as her main but the waitress brought it with the apps. My mom had to ask for her wine about 4x before the waitress remembered. Just really ridiculous. 

One of the oddest moments was that my dad, not wanting to wait a century for the waitress to check on us, went up to the counter and asked the fellow to cut his pita sandwich in half. The fellow took the plate, disappeared for a moment, came back and handed the plate to my dad. Dad comes to sit back down and unwraps his pita and it was whole. Not cut. I have no idea wtf the fellow was doing with the pita?

So with that, I score this place a 2. The food was excellent. So much better than a take out Greek place. Portions were generous, and they have one of the best Greek salads I've ever tasted. The pita was soft and fluffy. 5 star food. 

Such a shame but the service was so bad and it really made for an annoying experience."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to go back to Main St Greek. This time we didn't get take out and actually ate in.

I decided to try the pork souvlaki dinner this time and my hubby had the gyros dinner because he really liked the quality of the meat the first time we were there.

Pork souvlaki dinner - quality of meat is really good. My rice was overcooked and very oily. I still don't care much for the potatoes as they are over seasoned and too mushy.

Gyros dinner - same great quality of pork as the souvlaki dinner. My hubby also felt that the rice was mushy and oily. As if they did something to revive it, but it was a major fail because it didn't work. He ordered fries instead of potatoes.

Both dinners came with \"Greek\" salad. It was smothered in dressing which is still too bland. Maybe a hint of lemon can freshen it up? I took a couple of pictures of the meals - i'll post them shortly.

Food came fairly quickly, service was good. BUT we were never asked if we enjoyed the food or if we would like another soft drink or more water. It wasn't busy, only 2 other tables with 4 or more people that were waited on and looked after more frequently than our server came to our table.

The only thing that stands out for me is the quality of the pork for the dinners - it's so tender & seasoned well.  Next time i'm going to try souvlaki on a pita. Maybe that will add another star, but for now they've moved up from 2 to 3 stars. 

Back to Greek town i go!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch after church.  Beautiful little restaurant in a quaint part of Markham.  We ordered a nice mix of appetizers.  Loukaniko was on point with a very traditional fresh orange and cumin flavour.  Greek fries were crisp and hot and the feta slightly melted into them.  Soooo good.  Pork gyro plate was everything we love about real meat (not ground meat) gyro.  Every piece was charred, flavourful, meaty goodness.  Hummus , a large horiakiti (Greek village salad) and a couple of chicken skewers rounded out our meal for 4 people.  we ate until we were stuffed and still took enough home for a full dinner for at least 3 people.  Everyone at the restaurant were friendly and service was quick.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Greek restaurants that I've been too. Ordered the grilled octopus, chicken gyro wrap, chicken souvlaski dinner, and baklava. They also served bread with our meal. Not just regular bread with  butter but toasted garlic bread! Thevoctopus wasn't chewy, as it usually is, and didn't have a fishy taste which I personally like. The wrap was huge and the chicken in both dishes were cooked perfectly. All the dishes were reasonably priced as our bill came up $40. Would've definitely come back again"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, you haven't had good greek fries. It was, in one word UNBELIEVABLE! I love love love their greek fries, or even just their regular fires. Perfectly crispy, greasy, but not too greasy, and best of all, they taste like heaven. I recommend the chicken souvlaki and, when you get it on pita it is the greatest. They're heavenly fries are stuffed IN the delicious wrap. You must, must, must go here!"}
{"text":"Walking up and down Main Street Markham we were starting to get hungry; Yelp comes to the rescue again! In this little strip comprised of three short blocks there are a number of quaint restaurants BUT what draws people to Main Street Greek is comfort food at reasonable prices.

I had the Spanokopita for $4.75 (Spinach, feta and phyllo pastry) and my friend had the Chicken Gyro ($7) with a side of fries ($3). The Spanokopita tasted good but I think it would have been better if it was warmed up. The Gyro was tasty (had fries inside) but the pita was a little harder than I'm used to. Now the fries were sooooo delicious - crisp and hot right out of the fryer. 

Main Street Greek is comfortable, homey and clean, with friendly wait staff, serving up good food at a good price. With happy full bellies we continued our leisurely tour of Main Street Markham."}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood restaurant. The prices are very reasonable, and the staff are super friendly. It's not a huge menu, but they do every item well. The souvlaki is tender and the fries are nice and crispy. They also bring you some complimentary garlic bread, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! If I'm looking for good Greek food I usually would drive down on the danforth and take my pick... about 3 weeks ago I decided to give this place a try and have been back 4 times since!

Chicken beautifully seasoned and cooked to perfection. Calamari lightly breaded and deep fried to get that amazing crunch.

Fairly priced and located right in the heart of Main Street Markham, the setting just adds to the richness of flavours !

Chicken gyro in a pita will not disappoint you!"}
{"text":"Amazing.   Will be back.  Only downfall was that they had run out of moussaka by 7 pm     We will be back"}
{"text":"I was craving grilled octopus so I checked out Main St Greek. I wasn't sure if it was sit down or takeout but was pleasantly surprised when I saw that they did both. The food was really great!  If you sit down you get a basket of garlic bread which is nice and warm. The grilled octopus was $17 for just one tentacle and I would have been very disappointed if I hadn't ordered a side salad.  The chicken souvlaki was very good and the potatoes were amazing, but apparently the rice tasted just like Uncle Ben's boxed mix which is disappointing for a nice restaurant. The service was also quite amazing, as the server was very attentive and kind. Although I didn't have any, the baklava looked phenomenal. My only recommendation would be adding descriptions of the dips/traditional dishes because I'm not sure what they were and had to google them."}
{"text":"Good quality greek food on main st markham."}
{"text":"This place is small and cozy, there decoration is beautiful. There chicken souvlaki is moist, and there salad is DELICIOUS. Though, the potatoes were decent and the rice was good. Usually the rice in several Greek restaurants I've been to compared to fast food Greek is that there's no vegetables like carrots and peas. But overall, really good. Wished they still had the loukoumades. Really good service too!"}
{"text":"Delicious Greek food. We tried the chicken and pork gyro as well as the grilled octopus and calamaria, all were great!"}
{"text":"Great service, price well and most importantly food is 8-9/10 most of the time, highly recommend"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a few times and have thought to myself that I need to come back to try the place out but didn't have a chance to until this week.  It did not disappoint! I love the feel - fairly casual, great lighting,  just love the atmosphere.  Great for a chill dinner  (we were on a double date with a close friend). Food was great.  I had the pork souvlaki dinner and substituted the rice for grilled veggies - great idea because the rice would have been way too heavy. My boyfriend had the chicken gyros wrap and was still talking about it the next day, which never happens. They have a beer called 'Fix' which was really good. The waitress was great - attentive and my friend wanted to know what something looked like so the waitress pulled up a Google Image on her phone. Never had someone do that before. Highly recommend this new hot spot!"}
{"text":"My dining companions for the evening, and I, were looking for a place to eat when one of them suggested \"that Greek place on Main St\". I thought \"What Greek place on Main St.? Unionville? Markham?\" They got my attention so off to Main St. Markham we went.

Main St. Greek. Nice simple appropriate name. We could smell the food as we approached. Mmm. The small dining room was full but a couple had just left and we got the last two tables. Yay! The space is clean and cozy, with an open grill/kitchen. It still feels new. Nice.

We ordered a bunch of appetizers and the Pikilia platter for five of us. The platter includes 2 lamb chops, 1 loukaniko (sausage), 2 chicken and 2 pork souvlaki, 2 bifteki (beef patties), Greek salad, tzatziki, and bread.

The food started arriving and my companions were patient enough to wait until I took some pictures. It's okay, they know the routine by now and are used to eating cold food. LOL!

The Tiropita (feta, flaky phyllo pastry) was very good, perfectly flaky, not too salty. The Saganaki yielded huge flames! Opa! The Pork Gyros was excellent, perhaps my favourite dish of the evening. It was made with real pork, not the preformed cones of ground meat you see in food courts. We ordered a second serving later. I'll have to try the chicken version another time. The Calamaria was crispy and well done. The Greek salad, fries, and bread were all standard fare but good.

The main event arrived last. All the meat was cooked very well, tender and moist. Everything was seasoned well. There was a flavour in the sausage that I couldn't pinpoint but it made it my least favourite item on the platter. I didn't dislike it but I probably wouldn't order it as a meal. The platter was a good way to sample several of their dishes at once. It could probably serve 3-4 people. Their house-made tzatziki was very good.

Although I don't live in Markham, I'm a frequent visitor and diner. I know I'll be visiting Main St. Greek again."}
{"text":"Since the beginning of time (okay more like the past 5 years) I've been looking for a decent greek restaurant in markham. THIS PLACE HAS BLOWN IT OUT OF THE PARK. The location is still kind of far for me but definitely worth it. If i lived closer I would probably be here everyday. Definitely get the gyro, calamari and taramasalata."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and made from scratch. You can tell from tasting it. 

We've gone here now 4 times and every time service is quick. Food is tasty. 

This Greek place is s welcome break from what it seems like only Italian places on Markham main street. 

The dips are all delicious. Chicken souvlaki is good. And not just chicken on a stick. Clearly marinated and nice and juicy. 

Salads are fresh and simple. Good dressing. 

Nothing fancy here. Just good simple Greek food."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD! Highly recommend Greek Family Restaurant! The staff is super friendly and always making sure you are well taken care of!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! A greek restaurant that is just as good as ones on the Danforth, outside of the city! Main St Greek is just as good, maybe even better, than most greek take out type places on Danforth. The pork gyro is outstanding. Love the Greek feta fries, the saganaki, the calamari, etc etc. 

This is coming from a greek....please try this place, you will not be disappointed.

And to the owners of the restaurant....please don't let your standards slide. Keep up the great work and keep it family run. It makes all the difference."}
{"text":"Really good! Ordered take out from here twice. Food is fast, fresh and good quality. I enjoy the potatos, rice, Greek salad, and moussaka (sometimes a bit heavy on the nutmeg in the bechamel but generally good).

In particular, I would like to praise the Greek salad. At most places this is a poorly composed, throwaway item. However at Main St Greek, the salad is generous, with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers and tons of feta. I greatly appreciate this. In fact, even my husband - who pretty much never eats salad - will eat this one without my nagging him! 

The chicken is occasionally dry. 

Overall, Portions are generous and I often have enough for lunch the next day. 

Nice place!"}
{"text":"After what seemed like ages, this place finally opened. Located on Main St in Markham, parking is typically not too difficult to come by. 

The place was filled when we came in to order takeout.  I opted for the roasted lamb dinner and my partner, the chicken souvlaki dinner. Not wanting the starch heavy meal combos of potatoes AND rice, we inquired if we could substitute the potatoes and the rice for side salad instead. 

We are told that we can do this for a charge of four dollars each. Hmmmm. We don't want the potatoes or rice and are charged for that in the cost of the dinner 'combo' but have to pay an extra four dollars apiece for salad. Worth mentioning is that this 'salad' consists merely of chopped iceberg lettuce, slightly browning, red onion, equivalent of quarter tomato and one olive with a very seemingly hesitant sprinkling of feta atop. 

The food was ok.  Nothing remarkable. We won't return as $54 dollars was ridiculous for the amount/quality of food we received."}
{"text":"This delightful authentic Greek restaurant does not disappoint. It's clean and simple decor makes the experience relaxing. The staff make you feel at ease and welcomed. The owners/cooks are true Greeks and know how to prepare and serve a delicious, hearty meal. The portions are generous. The prices are reasonable. We always return."}
{"text":"Horrible, High price point and small portion. I would rather go to Greek Stop instead. Although I work around the corner, but I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Main Street Greek is probably the BEST Greek place I've ever been to. The service was great, the food was great, the prices are worth it, and above all, the atmosphere there was amazing. It felt very welcoming and so family-friendly, almost as if I were travelling in another country! And the Greek salad there is DELICIOUS. 

Our server, an older blonde lady wearing glasses (I don't remember her name), was extremely attentive and noticed what we needed before we even asked. 

For example, we got three salads that came with our meals (we had four people) and she immediately asked me if I wanted another plate to share. 
Also when she noticed my friend using a butter knife to cut his meat, she quickly brought up a sharper knife and told him it would be easier to cut with. 

Overall, I have to say I'm extremely impressed with the service, the food, and the atmosphere of the restaurant. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Friday night dinner.

First time eating in.

Come early, its full house by 6:30-7pm

They take reservations! Make a reservation!


Service was very good!
The 2 ladies were 4-5star service!!

The pork gyros dinner was good, bit salty, potatoes could have been better.

Calamari was good! For the price, should be a bit more on quantity.

Pork souvlaki dinner was good!! Meat is good!

Salad was ok.
The tzaziki was much better this time around!

4.5 stars for overall experience.

Parking is a pain, main street rush hour is bumper to bumper."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by to pick up a chicken gyro. It is a nice clean restaurant. The staff was friendly and it did not take long for the gyro to be ready. The price was also reasonable.
I had take out and the food smelled great all the way home. Every bite tasted delicious and the chicken was well cooked. 
Would like to go back and eat in next time."}
{"text":"Main Street Greek just opened this past Monday. I have been driving by waiting for this day since I saw the sign a few months back. 

We decided to try some takeout for dinner tonight. I had the Pork Gyros on a Pita. This is the real deal folks. It's not the hamburger style. It's fresh meat seasoned and piled high on top of its self on the vertical spits. I like the hamburger style but for me this is the traditional Gyros that you would get in Greece. 

I usually would go for the chicken gyros but today decided to switch it up and go for the pork. My gyros was served on a nice soft pita with the typical tzatziki, tomato and of course fries. (No onions for me!). The meat was crispy and tender. With a nice mix of lean and semi lean pieces. The tzatiki was definitely home made and had an excellent balance. Not too garlicky and just enough cucumber. 

As I waited I checked out the menu and it looks like they have a great selection of food. Some of the things that caught my eye was oven baked lamb, grilled octopus, and my favorite calamari. The prices were fair. You can check out the menu below on their website. 

I will definitely returning and wish all the best to our new favorite Greek restaurant in Markham."}
{"text":"The Greek food here is pretty good. They have great service with friendly staff. I have only been here once but it felt like 30 degrees inside and they just had doors open with no AC. I would just takeout next time if they still don't have AC as it was super uncomfortable, especially with the heat from cooking food added to the heat from outside."}
{"text":"This nice Greek restaurant in downtown Markham has good food and a laidback vibe. The restaurant is located in the heart of Markham, next to many other shops and eateries. The interior is nicely decorated and feels very open. The staff was a bit curt, but that didn't detract much from the overall experience.

You can get your food for takeaway or for dine-in - I chose the latter. They have a nice variety of Greek dishes, including gyro sandwiches, souvlaki, lamb, moussaka, and more. I ended up getting the roast lamb, which was tender, delicious, and a large portion size. Most dinner meals come with potatoes, rice, and salad - but in my opinion potatoes AND rice is just too much carbs, so you can substitute out one of them for roasted vegetables, which is what I did. The roasted vegetables were quite good, though the potatoes were pretty bland - they could've used more seasoning. The salad was very nice - I got the horiatiki salad instead of the traditional Greek salad.

Overall it was tasty food and a relaxing meal. Check it out if you're in the area and want something other than Asian."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Some of the best Greek food I've had in a long time.  Much better than the Danforth.  Food was very fresh, hot and seasoned well.  We will be back many times as it's great value for the price and the overall quality is awesome.  

Congratulations to the owners and staff on a job well done."}
{"text":"Have been there couple of days when I was craving for Greek salad. I have to say that compares to the other  greek restaurants, this restaurant is a bit over-priced. The chicken Greek salad I ordered only has few piece of chicken on it. And it cost me 17 CAD in total(tax&tips). The waitress is very friendly and the atmosphere is just fine tho."}
{"text":"PORK GYRO ON A PITA IS A MUST!
Main St Greek is an affordable and now my favourite Greek restaurant I have ever tried in Markham! I got the Pork Gyro on a pita and it was very tasty, the best in Markham. The pork was savoury and not dry, the fries and tomatoes inside were good, and their was a right amount of tzatziki inside. I have also tried the greek salad and it was delicious too. Will definitely come back again to get a Pork Gyro on a pita. Service was also friendly and environment had a cozy-touch."}
{"text":"Very munch enjoyed the food, atmosphere and service today at Greek on Main. Perfect lunch for our Sunday afternoon. Thank you. Kim and Doug, Scottsdale AZ"}
{"text":"This Greek restaurant was really good. The restaurant itself has pretty plates on the wall but it feels very clean, service was friendly, and their souvlaki platter is amazing! 

We got their Taramosalata spread (with pita) which is this pink, cured roe dip, perfect for anyone who likes that fishy, salty flavour! Although I describe it as salty, the salt was not overbearing at all. Only thing is I wish they provided more pita because we had half the spread left (but of course I brought it home to have for later). 

We also got their pork souvlaki dinner and WOW I cannot believe how juicy and flavourful the pork was!!! I mean, I like Jimmy the Greek (Judge all you want)...their dinner plate satisfies me. But Main St. Greek has redefined what a legitimate souvlaki dinner is for me!

Their spanakopita was pretty bland though. That was the one dish I did not like. 

I will definitely be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars only because the quality of their meat is really good. Otherwise i would say they are not far off from food court standard dinners. I've been there 2x now in the past 2 months. I've had the chicken souvlaki dinner and the gyros dinner. My chicken souvlaki was dry and heavily seasoned with pepper?!? The rice tasted like Uncle Bens rice and the potatoes looked NOTHING like the photos other people have posted on here. Mine were mushy and had the same pepper overkill as my chicken. The gyros dinner meat was really, i chose fries as my side. The fries were ok, but if you're serving pork tenderloin as meat at a Greek restaurant, fresh cut fries should be served, NOT frozen. The salad...was swimming in a tasteless dressing that i didn't bother to try after 2 tastes. Lastly, the pricing. I was expecting a lot more considering that dinner for 2 can set you back around $60 after an app & 2 dinners. Portions need to be a bit bigger for what they charge. Service was not as amazing as some have posted about. It was slow and we weren't asked how our food was or if we needed another drink. We had to flag down our server a couple of times and it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"AWESOME Greek restaurant on main. The interior is simple yet so beautiful- makes the whole place bright and refreshing. Chairs, decorations and even the plates give it a very authentic vibe. 

Food we got: 
- greek fries: crunchy and topped with fresh feta cheese
- gyros chicken pita: ive never had it with fries inside but took the chance and decided to try it... was not disappointed at all!!! Complimented the dish perfectly.
- chicken souvlaki dinner: huge portion and extremely filling. Came with rice and potato's as sides, with tzatziki sauce. Chicken was juicy and delicious with the sauce. 

What surprised us was the bread and salad that came with my chicken meal. It filled me up so much that I had to pack my entree to go. Bread was delicious and the salad was also really good (perfect sauce!) 

Service was incredible. Even though there were many tables and only one server on the floor, her service was still impeccable!"}
{"text":"I had a real hankering for some Greek food, so we decided to check in for a crush-craving meal. I have been here one time before and was a bit hesitant to try it again. From my prior experience, the staff were very friendly, and the food was decent. The only thing that left a sour taste in my mouth was that the portions of lamb were very inconsistent. For $20 I had 2 of the smallest pieces of lamb I had ever been served, not to mention more than half of it was bone. Yet one of my fellow diners who ordered the same, had 2 large meaty hunks of lamb. 

Willing to give it another shot, we dropped by. Fair warning, the portions here are quite large, so if you plan on ordering appetizers, you're more than likely going to be taking home leftovers. We had the spanakopita and calamaria to start, and the chicken souvlaki dinner. The server was very friendly, and checked on us quite often, so kudos for that.

The garlic bread we were given to start was okay. The bread was chewy and a bit lacking in garlic and butter. The calamari is served with a side of lemon and tzatziki.  It was well fried and paired very well with the tzatziki. The breading had a slight bitterness, like it had been beer battered. The spanakopita was decent. Spinach flavour was on point, but it was a bit dry and could have used more cheese. 

The salad was probably my favourite. They have the BEST Greek salad I've ever had. Crisp iceberg lettuce, with a creamy white sauce and feta cheese. However, when the server had come to clear a few plates, we didn't notice she took away our salad plate. There may have been only a little left, but without asking us if we were finished she took it away. By no means did I expect a free new salad, but it's really disheartening when you want to take take a quick bite of salad with your souvlaki and rice and find it missing. We asked the server if she cleared it, and she was kind enough to bring us a new one (1/3 plate, same as we had left).

The chicken souvlaki was good. Juicy with a nice charred flavour. The potatoes were very lemony, but a bit lacking in the herbs that Greek potatoes are known for. The rice, was very wet, and kind of mushy; too overcooked for my liking. 

Overall, a decent meal with friendly service."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Super cute little place! Very new and clean. The server was super friendly and efficient, really liked her!;) The prices were decent and everything was pretty spot on. Definitely will be my new Greek spot!;)"}
{"text":"3.5 around up to 4 because Main St Greek is probably the only decent sit down Greek Restaurant in the area.

Greek food in Markham is hard to find. Main St Greek is definitely a welcome addition in the neighbourhood. My dine in experience was decent but does have room for improvement.

Spanokopita ($4.50) Not as fresh as the bottom of the pastry was hard and crumbled together

Loukariko ($7) Pork Sausage Flavored with Orange Peel

Pork Souvlaki on Pita ($6)

Loukoumades ($4) which was supposed to serve with Vanilla Ice Cream but no one told us they don't have ice cream till they served us. I would not have order this without the ice cream and we still charged the full price

The menu though limited but does have most of the Greek Classic. But I am not really sure if I want to spend on the more expensive item like Lamb Chops or Grilled Octopus. I will be back for sure though.... 

They still owes me my ice cream!!"}
{"text":"Main St Greek, such a hidden place to find for a decent meal. Parking is not easy to find around this place, but nice place to walk around during the summer after dinner. Some bars around the area on the same street, so it does get busy during the summer time. The food was pretty tasty, and the portion wasn't bad either. It isn't easy to find a good Greek restaurant in Markham, consider Greektown is at Danforth. I order the Chicken Souvlaki dinner. The chicken was cooked perfectly on the grill served with their rice and Greek salad, everything went really well together. This dinner isn't really big, max capacity around 20 people. Small place to dinner, but really friend staffs."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner for takeout and I have to say that it was some of the best Greek food I have had thus far. 

The food itself deserves 5 stars because it was very fresh and the portion size was very generous. It came with chicken, rice and a lot of potatoes. You also get a Greek salad and some bread on the side too. 

This place is definitely a hidden gem in Markham for Greek food and I'm glad I tried them out.  I still think, despite the delicious food, that maybe it's a tad bit on the pricier end. My order was about $18 after tax.  Some people may find that reasonable however, so I still highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food here was great. From the salad to the garlic bread to the entree was nothing but deliciousness.

Service was fast and friendly
Portion size was huge (ordered bifteki) which comes with salad, garlic bread, entree (beef patties, potatoes and rice). 

Overall 5/5

Highly recommended: Honestly, this is the best Greek Salad I've ever had."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great addition to Main Street Markham. Service was friendly and food was quite good. Restaurant is bright and clean with an open kitchen where you can see through it from the sitting area. 
We had chicken souvlaki dinner with came with one skewer of chicken, generous portion of rice and potatoes and a good size salad. Chicken was perfectly done, juicy and good flavour. Potatoes were ok; rice was well seasoned. The Greek salad got served first before they brought out the rest of the entree; which was perfect. Salad was fresh and tasted so refreshing; good amount of lettuce and cheese. The salad paired nicely with the complimentary garlic bread. Garlic bread was not oily; tasted great when it was warm.  
Calamari was quite well done too; perfectly cooked. Not chewy. 

Overall, we enjoyed our first visit. Good food and friendly service.  Will return"}
{"text":"Very nice gyro ; and the Greek fries were tasty. The salad was nice, not too much dressing which was good. Greek coffee was great. They turned off music a bit earlier on Saturday but otherwise was awesome."}
{"text":"I've not had true Greek food before, and Main St. Greek has set the bar super high. As we were driving down Main Street Markham, we spotted this little store front for \"authentic\" Greek food. Not sure what I was expecting, we walked in, and we were greeted by cute blue and white decor. It spoke Greek loudly, but in the classiest and simplest way. 

We ordered a Greek salad and I had the chicken gyros and my buddy had the pork version. It came in a timely manner and we had some of the loveliest service I've had in a while. I believe it was a family run business and the woman was actually Greek and the whole experience was genuine. Unbeknownst to me, the fries actually came INSIDE the gyro, which Kris told me was the authentic way. Interesting.  He let me have a bite of his pork, which I have to say topped my chicken. It was incredibly juicy and was roasted on the spit which you can see from your seat. If I came again: pork over chicken. I found my chicken a taaad dry, which is why I'm knocking it down 0.5. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and I would come back again if I was ever in the area. It definitely felt authentic and the service was amazing. 4.5/5."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Main St Greek if you're craving for some authentic Greek cuisine. I've only been here three or four times from 2017 until now but I've had (almost) perfect experiences each time. 

I've ordered the Chicken Gyros Pita, Chicken Souvlaki Dinner, Mousaka, Calimari, the Greek Salad and the Village Salad. The prices are reasonable and the portions are large. I always need my boyfriend to help me finish my meal. If you're only ordering one main, it comes to about $20 after tax and tip. 

The meat is so soft and juicy. The potatoes are made to perfection - extremely soft but not falling apart and so full of flavour. I love the rice because, again, it's so soft (I'm sensing a theme here!) I've tried many places (not just Greek restaurants) where the texture of the rice is so hard that it makes me wonder if it's even been cooked properly.

The salad is delicious though I wish they would add more tomatoes! 

The Mousaka is the best I've tried (so far) in the GTA but still doesn't compare to what I had in Greece :(

One thing I didn't like is that during my most recent visit for dinner, my friend and I had stopped eating because we were chatting. The server came over with a take out box and asked if we needed one. Shortly after, she came over with the bill. It felt like we were being rushed out of the place. They still had a little over an hour before closing, there were many tables available, nobody was in line to be seated, and we still had a full glass of wine on the table. 

Overall I'd definitely recommend this restaurant. It's great for what it is. My friend who's lived in Greece for most of her life also thinks this is one of the best in the GTA!"}
{"text":"Situated on Main Street markham in a newly built building amongst other shops, this place is in a prime location. 

Fairly new, I have pasted by here on several occasions without popping in to try it. So tonight, for dinner, I decided to give it a go. 

For an appetizer, I wanted to order a spinach dip, but was told that it was served cold. So I passed on that and ordered a chicken souvlaki dinner. My SO ordered the chicken gyro. 

My meal started with a salad and some bread.  Salad was okay, toppings just placed on top of the salad in a plate. With some stale bread on the side. 

On to the meal, which came with potatoes and rice.. the serving size was tiny. Couple potatoes and a scoop and a half of rice. Literally. 5-6 pieces of chicken. For the price, you get ALOT more at Loui's Kouzina. So I wasn't impressed at all. 

In regards to the foods overall taste, it was decent. Potatoes weren't bathed in tomatoe sauce but rather in lemon. The rice was thick and heavy. The chicken also good and cooked perfectly, but again for the price. Better can be had. 

Overall.. I'd come back, simply for the food. But since the price is equal to that of other Greek places I frequent, i probably won't be back as more \"bang for buck\" can be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Greek place in and out of Danforth.

Had the calamari.  It was so perfectly tender... the little squid didn't resist at all as my teeth went through it... They damn near said \"eaaaattt meeee\"... but like... less creepy...

The chicken Souvlaki was so juicy.  Seriously, I hate over cooked chicken which is found way too often with Souvlaki.  But these little babies are so damn juicy inside.  Seriously Juicy pieces hugged in a nice brown exterior with only touches char.  Yeah, I said hugged... cuz something this good gotta be made with love.  amirite?

The potatoes were so creamy.  The rice was nice and flavourful.  The salad were well balanced... not too sour... and no shortage of cheese. 

The place was bright and clean.  The staff were stars.  The plates on the wall were lovely and, not to mention, a nice conversation starter with my 3 yr old daughter.  \"Daddy?  Why are there plates on the walls?\"  \"ummmm...\""}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, fresh and delicious. Service with a smile.   Atmosphere welcoming.  And the gyro....Just like I've had in Greece....The real deal with the fries inside. Yum"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation and their food is pretty delicious. I got the pork souvlaki which came with Greek salad and each table had complimentary garlic bread so that's a plus. The portion for the main dish was pretty big as well we couldn't even finish and had to take the rest to go. The pork was very tender and juicy and the plate definitely had more potatoes than I expected (very filling). The only thing I would suggest is maybe some hot sauce on the side for some extra kick. The restaurant is relatively small but it does feel pretty welcoming when you go in. Most of the servers are a bit older and the cooks are in the front right beside the counter. Prices are fair as well, not extra expensive. I often crave for Greek food and this place definitely hits the spot!"}
