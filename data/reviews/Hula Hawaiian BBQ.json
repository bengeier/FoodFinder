{"text":"I guess the tiki gods smiled down upon this out of the way Hawaiian restaurant, because I was sure pleasantly surprised.  They offer chicken and pork dishes that are quite good for a chain restaraunt in a mini-mall.  I doubt this is the 'real deal' when it comes to ethnic Hawaiian fare, but still I found it to be a good value and yummy food."}
{"text":"Had the kalua pig n cabbage. Not like home but it was close and tasted pretty good. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Its affordable and good. The bbq chicken burger and short ribs and chicken were good. The chicken was tender and had good flavor. The mural on the wall was nice to look at and good location."}
{"text":"I agree with J.L about this restaurant. Definitely worth trying if you're looking for something different in the area. They offer togo (No drive-thru) and the place is very clean inside. Definitely a better alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Yummy in the tummy. I really like the shrimp. This place is clean the staff helpful. No complaints."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and enjoyed myself plenty.  Had the spicy terriyaki with some siracha (on the side) and it was dynomite!  Would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Chicken teriyaki mini meal was just what I needed. It was reasonably priced and reasonably tasty. We stopped here because we were shopping in the same complex. It was clean and pleasant inside and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Food here is excellent! I've only had their chicken, steak and short ribs, but they were all excellent. The short ribs are tender and so flavorful you don't even need to add the side teriyaki sauce, but you just have to because it's some of the best sauce I've had! Combo plates are served with a side of white rice and macaroni salad. Salad is just okay, but both sides go excellent with the meat. The lady at the register always greets me with a friendly smile, but she's never really been the friendliest when taking my order. With food so good, I don't even care. I've kept coming back!"}
