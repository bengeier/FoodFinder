All the old ladies love ABC Country (and LL Cool J). I go to a church where 80% of the congregation is over the age of 55, and they all love coming here for special occasions. Every now and then, I'd hear, \"we're going to ABC for a special Sunday brunch.\" \"My daughter is in town and she's taking me to ABC!\" \"It's our anniversary and we're going to ABC.\"

So my nephew and I walk over one day, and are immediately greeted by a warm and friendly staff. The decor is very much out of a Country Living magazine circa 1994, but clean and inviting. He ordered a pulled pork sandwich, I got an order of yam fries and the spinach pecan salad.

The food here isn't amazing, but it is pleasant. I can see why senior citizens love it here. The coffee is surprisingly tasty for a chain restaurant! And I drink my coffee black, so there's nothing to mask the flavor. The friendliness of the staff is 100% genuine. Solid 3 stars. I've been back a few times for coffee and hangs."}
{"text":"ABC Country Restaurant is an esthetically pleasing little restaurant that is right off of Deerfoot South on 24th Street.  I have driven by it for years and acknowledged it, but have only recently stopped in, because I was starving, and the Bull and Finch $3.99 breakfast was not open yet.

When I walked in, the staff were extremely pleasant and the restaurant was about half full.  It was extremely clean and the decor is pleasant and quaint.  The decor, matter of fact, is exactly what you would expect of a place with \"Country Restaurant\" in the name.

The menu was diverse with lots of choices, and I ended up getting Traditional Eggs benedict.  I was given a choice of hash browns or sliced tomatoes, and I chose the sliced tomatoes.  When they arrived, they looked delicious and I looked forward to digging in.  They tasted pretty good.  They weren't the best eggs benny that I had, but they were good.  The hollodaise could have used some more zing, but I was not disappointed with my meal.  Within about 10-15 minutes, every last bit was gone.

So why only 3 stars?  Why only an \"A-OK\" rating?

In my opinion, this restaurant is extremely overpriced.  Its not overpriced for \"Calgary\", but it is overpriced for the Douglasdale/Riverbend area.  The pricing of this breakfast menu, was comparable to downtown/marda loop/eau claire area, without the trendiness factor. For two people, our breakfast was $38, plus tip. 

The quality of the eats?  Well, it was okay. I would eat there again, from the standpoint that the food was okay, but the reality is, it was \"breakfast\", so it was as good as most places that I go for breakfast.  

The highlight to me, was the staff.  Everyone that acknowledged us, their face genuinely lit up.  I have not been to a friendlier restaurant in some time.  In reality, my opinion is that I expect to pay almost $40 for breakfast inner city when I am sitting in a trendy neighborhood, lined out the door.  But I don't expect that in a suburban, middle class neighborhood.  I enjoyed what I ate. It was only the bill that left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This is a fine little family restaurant with very good food for the price. My wife and I love taking our kids here mostly because they really have a great kids menu. As well Wednesday kids eat free which is always a bonus. We moved from cougar ridge and this is what was lacking in that area. A restaurant with great food that the kids can come too that mom and dad can still enjoy a cold beer or a glass of wine. 

The staff here are very friendly as well. 

Always a family favourite."}
