{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. Wait staff is always very attentive, constantly refilling drinks, etc. Lunch rush does make for a bit of a wait, but there are only so many tables. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've tried lots of Asian restaurants and this one is by far the best one.  Every time I have to go in the office is where I go for lunch.  Prices are very good too."}
{"text":"I work across the street from this place, it serves very consistent, tasty Chinese Food. I usually call in for takeout, but the dining in experience is very enjoyable. 

They have very gracious hostesses/cashier's. 

You can't go wrong with their Chicken Fried Rice or Black Pepper Steak, those are my favorites. 

They have your standard Chinese Food menu and it is nothing like a Panda Queen located in a strip mall, MUCH better than that nonsense. 

Side Note: If you want to see efficiency at its finest, go during lunch time and watch the two cashier's work their magic, they can do so many things at once it will seriously impress you."}
{"text":"The veggies look freah but everything is bland. Very bland. Very very bland. Not much pineapple in the chicken pineapple dish. Nor is there any hint of a true Thai taste. I also ordered the curry chicken noodle bowl. Again, VERY bland. Not much of a coconut taste either. Thai food is my favorite and this just flat out does not taste like thai food.  The 2 starts are just because the broccoli looks fresh."}
{"text":"Went here for my One of my Anniversary meals and we loved it.  They let us sample wines before we bought a bottle.  The restaurant staff was really friendly and made you feel like you've been here several times.  They really love to conversation and get to know you.  The food was pretty good for Asian cuisine in the south.  I'm form the north and I'm very particular about my Asian cuisine.  I recommend the Tower platter and the calamari for Apps.  I chose to have the General Tao as an entree which was fresh and had a lot of flavor.  It was basically a premium version of General Tso that you would get from any neighborhood Chinese restaurant.  I would def come again when I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a couple of times since moving to this neighborhood. Staff are super nice. Would love to see this place do better. A couple of words to think about ... Restaurant Impossible ..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area. It's an easy walk from anywhere in downtown. The food is delicious (I have had the Mongolian beef, my favorite, as well as several chicken dishes). All the food was hot, and per my request, not too spicy. Tasty salads and a good wine list to choose from. The service is fast and friendly but not annoying."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food, not great but, very good by Charlotte options.  In a big city it would just be a decent place, but with limited options in Charlotte, it is very good."}
{"text":"Price on the menu is not what they charge. Never give u the actual receipt. When asked they said the owners change the price. In reality they are owners but don't admit.  If they screw up then also they don't admit or even say sorry. No next time."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here was on a Sunday evening around 7pm. The food was terrible--chicken tasted like leftover bits from the week before and diced to be almost the size of grains of rice. Everything was bland and coated in too much corn starch, and I thought I would never eat here again; however, my opinion of the place has greatly changed in the last week. 

I decided to give this place another shot, to be fair. My second order was Monday at noon. Take out was ready in 10 minutes. Chicken in the eggplant special was overcooked, but flavor was great and you could tell everything was fresh and handmade. I've eaten here several (12) times since then, and it is my new favorite lunch spot. If you want authentic Chinese that reminds you of the homeland, this isn't it; however, it is good for what it is.

Pros:
-Fast
-Flavor is good and distinctive between dishes
-No food poisoning or emergency bathroom trips
-Brown rice or fried rice offered as sides with no upcharge
-Can order online without requiring credit card payment
-Lunch specials come with spring rolls 
-Can customize any dish without complaints--add veggies, change sauce, you name it! No upcharge for substitutions
-Portions large for the price.
-Everything on lunch menu under $8
-Everything is homemade--even wontons in wonton soup use whole wheat flour!
-Restaurant looks clean
-Food not swimming in grease, fried items are nicely fried
-Everybody knows your name (well, kind of--the two sister owners have incredible memory)

Cons:
-American-style Chinese food, so there is sometimes scary red food coloring in your food
-Dumplings, while homemade, have no filling. Filling is awesome and tasty if you get some, but I just got dough. 
-Meat is cooked inconsistently--sometimes I get dishes right on the verge of being cooked; other times it's overcooked. Shrimp and veggies are always perfect (yeah, I don't get it either).
-Weekday lunch chef A+++; other chefs not so good. 

Moral of the story? Go here for a quick, tasty, sometimes healthier alternative to the Epicenter at lunch. Stay away at dinner."}
{"text":"I'd say this is one of the more consistent lunch places in uptown. I usually get the dynasty noodles with a side hot sauce and the food always comes out pretty quickly. I guess they've got to keep the food moving since there's always a crowd during lunch hour. I wouldn't say that it's the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it definitely is one of the best Chinese places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"In brief: Snarky attitude, mediocre food (literally where's the beef?! in my beef dish?), generic Asian fusion decor, but convenient location in downtown Charlotte.

I came here with some people and hoped for passable Asian food. Being that I live in NYC, I am Asian, I travel to East Asia to basically worship food and such, I ADORE food. I figured I will lower my expectations for what is delicious due to its proximity away from Asian-centric epicenters. I don't want to be unfair and judge them due to circumstances beyond their reach. 

Yes, I love authentic Chinese food but I am also cool with Americanized Chinese food too. Please note the fact that the restaurant serves Americanized Chinese food isn't the reason for the low rating. I regularly order Americanized Chinese food when I want to confuse my mother and talk about crab rangoon. *smiles*

Here is the problem- our server has a major attitude problem! The two sisters who own the place need to keep in mind they are in the SERVICE industry- snarky comments won't help you. If you asked my table what we want to drink and one of us said hot and sour soup, don't roll your eyes and repeat your question as if my dining companion is an idiot! She wants to drink soup, so be it! What happened to the motto, \"The (thirsty) customer is always right?\" ;)

There were only a few slices of beef in my beef dish, super miserly it seemed about their portions overall.  The vegetables have seen better days and yikes, I can taste the MSG. Presentation was non-existent. At least the food came to us piping hot! 

It seemed that other people dining there had to flag down the waitstaff for simple requests such as water refills as well. 

I will definitely NOT return."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Holiday Inn Center City for a trip and happened to visit Soho Bistro for dinner on a rainy evening. The restaurant is clean, well laid out and appealing. The staff was exceptionally friendly and our waiter was a young man who was very eager to please. Unfortunately, the food was sub-par. The egg roll and scallion pancakes were hot and tasty, but our entrees were disappointing. I ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp. This wouldn't have been a big deal, but I have a shellfish allergy. They corrected the error, but when the chicken was served, it was burned and it was clear that the veggie garnishes were transferred from one plate to the other. My dinner companion ordered noodles which he described as tasting like watered down spaghetti with weak curry sauce. I can't stress how nice the people were, but the food portion could use a visit from Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"Raw deal. Uncooked omelet. Felt queasy all afternoon. They acted as if they were doing me a big favour when they didn't charge me for it.  When you feed a customer raw egg, you should really try to make it up to them."}
{"text":"Short and simple - one of places I eat when I'm Charlotte on business. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"In town for the week . One of the best General Tso's chicken I've had. Good service. Will be back this week."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. Sesame chicken was delicious and rice was on point. Egg rolls were average and $15 minimum on delivery is annoying if you just want something for one person."}
{"text":"While the food is tasty, service is fast, the person at the counter is a THIEF!! I went there with my friend & both ordered dishes worth 7.25 each. They don't ask if you need separate checks & usually get the check within few mins after lunch arrives. Final bill was 7.25+7.25+1.20(tax) = 15.7
We asked to split the check between 2 cards & guess what.. Our bills were 8.19 each. 
This is the second time this happened & I would suggest anyone going there watch their bill especially while splitting checks.
I went there today after around 2 years.. & same person at the counter, doing the same thing again. I just paid & walked away & I don't plan on going there again!"}
{"text":"Ordered Mongolian chicken for lunch, got oily tasteless heap of onions with some chicken in it. Not sure if the fried rice would actually meet the definition of fried rice as there was a lack of salt or seasoning. Not sure if I'll try again."}
{"text":"Superb service and reliably fine food from this family owned restaurant. Briskly busy at lunchtime, relaxed at night, always comfortable. A pleasure!"}
{"text":"For awhile this was our go to neighbourhood joint. Every time we went, we enjoyed the food and the prices are very reasonable. But we have recently figured out that the reason we liked it in the beginning is because we always went for brunch. Everything we have tried on the brunch menu has been good. 

We have now gone for dinner a couple of times. While some of the dishes are good, others are supremely bland (I am talking about you mushroom risotto). As a result, we only go for brunch now."}
{"text":"Very impressed with certain items like the ' Sauteed Bean Sprouts w/ Ginger'. Could not believe that Bean sprouts could taste that good. Also liked the Buddha Roll and the Asian Summer Roll. Brocolli With Garlic Sauce was not that great and neither was Thai Curry Tofu. Veggie Lo mein was good too.

{"text":"Pathetic food...Absolutely no taste. Pls dont waste your time and money"}
{"text":"After almost two years of living in Charlotte, I have finally found Chinese food that rivals my favorite restaurants in NYC. I must have tried 20 different places before finally ending up at this place that has been right under my nose this whole time. As good as it gets in Charlotte! The uptowntogo tool works great so I can submit my order online at work, walk over (have my food ready), pay and bring it back to my desk. Haven't braved trying to get a table or go during the lunch rush at noon though after reading some of these reviews. Definitely a fan! Delicious!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try the first night my wife and I were in Charlotte for a conference / vacation. The decor instantly puts you at ease. Very comfortable, not crowded at all around 7pm on a Thursday. This place has a good selection of beer and wine as well.

My wife and I are vegan, and we had no problems finding something to eat. I ordered the General Tao Tofu, my wife got the curried tofu and veg. Simply put, our dinner was perfect. Perfect portion sizes (not too big, not too little), served hot, and fresh. Wait-staff was always available and helpful, water glasses were always full.

A great place to eat out."}
{"text":"Finally a place I can find good Chinese food. I've been looking for a consistently decent Chinese joint in Charlotte and I believe I have found it. I ordered the shrimp and broccoli w/white rice to-go and it was great. Better than other places around the area"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and we were the only ones in there. We got great service because of it, but I wondered why no one else was in there? I got the eggplant special, as I always order eggplant in a Chinese restaurant.   The food was pretty good although the portions were small compared to some. I will likely return sometime."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but service is no good. I was here before a couple of years and did not want to go back because of the service. Unfortunately, went in for lunch today and had a similar experience with service. I know I won't make the same mistake again!"}
{"text":"I did not have high expectations for a Chinese restaurant called 'Soho Bistro' in Charlotte, but my expectations were blown away. The menu has a lot of vegetarian and vegan options, both appetizers and entrees. One of the servers is even vegetarian, so she can help navigate the menu. The lunch specials are a solid bargain. I had the kung pao tofu, and it was nice and spicy. I'll definitely be going back when I'm Uptown again."}
{"text":"This is located in the heart of downtown. Food is average and service is not bad. Will be busy during peak lunch hours from 11:30 to 1:30 PM. But take out is very fast. 

I have been going here for past 7 years and one thing that sucks big time is the two Cantonese women who manages this place.  They have no idea what is a good service in a restaurant means. They are rude. Literally rude. Half the time you don't understand what they speak in English. No in this restaurant are polite. They serve food as if they are serving people in homeless place. And they never treat you as patrons by the way. 

Am I eating and dining there ? \"No\". I am try taking out? \"Yes\"

{"text":"Menu has nothing special and food wasnt the greatest. 
Came here for bfs surprise bday. Staff were super nice. But i was a little peeved they didnt even offer us a deal for a party of 15. Only available if on one bill...um..no. 
Also this place closes up early at like 11pm, not the greatest for hosting events. I would say either improve your food or turn into a bar. 

I see this place going out of business quick. Hardly ever see anyone inside when i pass by. Sad because it's a great location and nice venue."}
{"text":"Great asian food, excellent service and close to uptown businesses.  The only downside is that during lunch it can be difficult to get a table with the lunch rush.  Arrive early or late in order to get in."}
{"text":"Soho is my go-to lunch spot at least once a week. The lovely sisters who own and run the place are friendly and charming. The service is fast and the menu has something for everyone at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I have had Chinese food in a bunch of different cities, including NYC and San Francisco to name a few. So far I have not found a good Chinese food place here in Charlotte. If you go to Soho for pick up don't follow their address to the T because it is actually on the other side of the building next to Fuel Pizza. Call ahead when you are about 5 minutes away and they will come outside to deliver your food. As far as the food goes, the dumplings are a little too doughy but the sauce is quite good. I would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland. I am not going to X this place out just yet I may give it another shot. Still looking for a good Chinese Food place here in Charlotte wish me luck!"}
{"text":"Sad to have to give a negative review, but like Sean I really feel like everything has slipped. I used to love going for their chicken caesar salad but twice recently my family has stopped for dinner based on location and convenience and I don't think we'll be back.

On one occasion I ordered that salad and it was swimming in dressing that tasted more bland than anything, the last thing caesar salad should be. We also had a burger which was dry and odd tasting.

We had creme brulee for dessert which was just sad, the top so over bruleed that you could barely crack the crust and and hot on the top and freezer cold on the bottom.

I have had better brunches there, but I'd say definitely skip supper."}
{"text":"In a lunch rush? You can count on Soho to delivery hot, plentiful edibles in the time it takes some people to get through a long drive-through line. Husband and I met up for lunch just a couple minutes after noon. By 12:30, we'd dined and had the check in hand.

Service is prompt, and polite/friendly in a rushed kind of way - they know how to get people in and out, on the double. We were checked on by three different servers, plus one more at the end of our meal after we'd finished eating and the plates had been cleared, who wanted to make sure someone had taken our order!

Husband likes the sweet & sour chicken, which always looks well prepared, though I've never tried it since it's not a favorite of mine. This time I went for the Thai Curry Shrimp ($6.99). The curry sauce tasted more in line with flavors I'd expect from Indian food - sweet and heavy on the turmeric - and like it maaay have had its origins in a bottle or package of some kind, but it was still good, and pleasantly, mildly spiced. There were large chunks of vegetables in the mix, and they are not stingy with the shrimp. The brown rice was good and chewy, and spring rolls served piping hot and crispy, straight from the fryer.

It may not be the most authentic international cuisine you'll ever eat, but when pressed for time and watching your budget, Soho is as great as anything you could want.

One last thing - be care with the address! While the city may put it on Tryon, the entrance is actually on College. I spent several minutes walking up and down Tryon between 5th and 6th, looking to no avail before finally calling Husband, who directed me down to the next street."}
{"text":"In the past, I LOVED Soho Bistro.. unfortunately, I got sick recently from eating there, and my boyfriend did too, the same night.  I decided that it was probably unrelated, so I ordered again. When I got the food it was cold and I was so disappointed. They used to be my go-to! If you're looking to drop a few pounds from being so sick that you can't keep anything in your stomach, then this might be the perfect place for you! Otherwise, I don't think I'll order from there again."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on 1/20/2012 with friends. Atmosphere isn't overly fancy like some places downtown, but definitely way nicer than your average take out Chinese.

Ordered sesame tofu since it's my old faithful at any Chinese restaurant... and boy was I impressed!  Definitely the best sesame tofu I've had since \"House\" on Independence closed down. Tofu was a perfect amount of chewy and crispy and not overly sauced. 

Steamed white rice was delish and spring rolls were definitely superior than any other I've had, but I couldn't put my finger on exactly why.

Vegetarian friendly.

The only down to this restaurant, like any business in downtown Charlotte, is that you have to park in a deck or meter on the street (if you can find one). I know for sure that Hearst Tower parking tickets can be validated by Soho so that parking is free!"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience there. It was a great restaurant two years ago. 
Old lettuce. Eggs overlooked in egg sandwich. Server was nice but cook was terrible. I wish this restaurant was better as its around the corner."}
{"text":"Awesome! Went for dinner last night with a group of four.  Two chicken dishes, two shrimp dishes: Sesame shrimp, Szechuan shrimp, Honey Lemon Chicken, Tangerine Chicken.  The flavors were amazing, but I hate eating dark meat.  I'm deducting a star for that.  We had a great little server and we couldn't have been happier!!! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love the food here, and I've been eating here for at least five of the almost ten years I've worked uptown.  The food is always hot, fresh, delicious, and perfectly spiced to order!  All of that considered, it's not the point of my review today.  I'm writing to commend them for their amazing service! 

Today my office needed a lunch order delivered.  It was huge and last minute... we needed to feed at least thirty people.  Soho Bistro got it packaged neatly (with name tags on each order for ease of distribution), and delivered SUPER hot and fast to our office!

Everyone here was VERY pleased and extremely grateful to Soho!  Our bellies are full and our afternoon is bearable thanks to you guys!!  AND it was delicious!!  

PS - thanks for the extra doughnuts!!"}
{"text":"Spring Roll - Tasted funny. It had a strange flavor. It was made with carrots & cabbage. I took one bite and spit it out."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese food in uptown, though I think that's an indictment of the overall quality of Chinese food in Charlotte.  The food here is average to good, and is always packed during the work week at lunchtime.  Service is fast, but otherwise forgettable.  Prices are very good as well, you can get out of there if you sit down for about 10-12 bucks with tip.  

I normally get the Tangerine chicken, or the beef and broccoli.  The chicken sometimes comes with too much sauce, but it has the right level of spiciness.  

Overall, a good place to sate your craving for Chinese, but if you are looking for a great meal, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a few years now, and every time I go it loses another star and another chance. It used to be the best place to get Chinese food but recently it has gotten really gross. Today was the last straw. I got the Steamed Chicken Dumplings and a order of Edamame to go. The dumplings had no taste other than salt,  the dough was so think and chewy I didn't eat my last two. The worst part were the soy beans. Half of them rotten, no salt, no seasonings, just plan nasty and I tossed about half of the order. Come on guys I know you can do better!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars for the extraordinary service. They make repeat customers feel like cherished friends. The sesame tofu is the best I've had in Charlotte. Breaded and super crispy... Yum!"}
{"text":"I tried Soho Bistro for the first time and am pretty happy with what I got. The Buddha rolls (basically spring rolls with just veggies) are huge and good and you get 3 in one order.  They come with a sweet sauce, which is not peanutty.  The scallion pancake is really super fried so it's definitely a rare occasion treat.  The soups (hot and sour and veg tofu) were both excellent and I would get them again in a heartbeat.  The sesame tofu was to die for.  I was hoping it wasn't a super fried dish and it did seem fried, but it didn't make me sick at all, which fried food often does.  It is addictive and I ate way more than I planned to.  The only dish that disappointed me and that I wouldn't get again was the mongolian beef.  The beef was either fatty or tendon-y so there was very little meat that was edible in the dish.  Maybe I just lucked out with it?  Everything else was so great, though, that I won't hesitate to return.  One more criticism - where are the chopsticks?  Every Chinese restaurant should provide them!"}
{"text":"Excellent foods! Wonderful people! Great location! Reasonable price! Good environment!"}
{"text":"The absolute best Chinese food in Charlotte! In fact, it's one of the only places we get Chinese food from down here. We ordered the General Tao chicken. It was well cooked and had plenty of spicy sauce. The staff is very friendly as well and the prices are fair. I would 100% recommend this place."}
{"text":"Usually recieve great service for delivery and my go to place for asian cuisne. This time the fried rice we ordered with our sesame chicken was a bit off. It tasted very old and had a funny smell. I called to request some brown rice instead. Poor customer service from the lady. She insisted that there was not a delivery to the address and was arguing with me about it. Will not be ordering from here again. All I wanted was some decent tasting rice to go with my sesame chicken."}
{"text":"Went to Soho Bistro for the first time today. The place is super busy during lunch time. We went in there after 12:30: there were lots of people waiting to pick up their take out orders by the door. There were also a line of people waiting in line to pay their bills after dining in. After waiting for awhile, we were able to get a table. Half of the tables were occupied, and most people were almost done with their food. The waiter was quick to get our drinks. He gave us some time to look at the menu (which I was ready to order when he brought us our drinks, but the waiter was too fast and I couldn't catch him in time to place our orders). The food on the other hand, took forever! It was a good 20-25 mins before we got our food. While we were waiting, I saw lots of take out orders coming out of the kitchen. I don't think I am gonna go back to this restaurant, but I guess if I do, I will just order take out early. 
Review for the food: I love that they have Okra on the menu! I got the Okra lunch special with beef and fried rice. The brown sauce they used for the okra and beef was good, but definitely high in sodium. I am kinda annoyed by the fried rice. I was totally expecting at least some carrots and onions with my fried rice. But fried rice at Soho bistro is merely white rice stir fried with soy sauce. I guess the stir fry made this fried rice, but all the other Chinese restaurants I have been to (which is a lot because 1. I am Chinese and I love Chinese food 2. I travel around the country and have my fair share of Chinese food from different restaurants) have veggies with their fried rice and often included BBQ pork."}
{"text":"I've dined and ordered take-outs from here about 20 or so times. I consider one of the perks of working in Hearst tower as having Soho just downstairs :)

Super quick service + consistently good food = good experience. My favorite dish at this place is black pepper beef. 

Tip - you can order your food without MSG, if you'd like."}
{"text":"When I use to work in Uptown Charlotte, I would typically eat here almost once a week.  It is rather small restaurant, and always has a line around Noon, but it's worth checking out.  Typically, I order the Tangerine Chicken with white rice and egg roll (substitute from spring roll); the wait time varies 5-10 minutes from order to table.  The portions are good compared to price and I never had any issues.  There is outside seating available, but its on the street and it can be pretty loud.  Overall, worth checking out if in the area and have a hankering for good Chinese food; if you go during the Lunch rush, try to go early or late."}
{"text":"The interior is nice so you'd think you are walking into a nice restaurant. There were a lot of other Asians so that was a good sign of authenticity. I almost wonder what type of Chinese food it was? Maybe cantonese? The food was very disappointing. I ordered steamed veggies with sauce and crab rangoon. Let me start off by saying no one can get egg drop soup or crab rangoon horribly wrong but I wasn't very fond of the sauce that came with my veggies. It was reddish in color a bit tangy and sweet. I would have liked some alternatives. I saw other people's food and it looked like food you could order from the local American style Chinese food...However it wasn't as greasy as looking here. Maybe I just don't know bit Ive Been around plenty of Chinese food and this just didn't give the vibe of the style I like, that's all. Not necessarily bad here but for my tastes it just wasn't right. Prices were very reasonable. Tea options were only Jasmine. Which makes me think this place is Thai or Vietnamese owned maybe? They didn't have any other varieties. Not sure she understood my broken Chinese."}
{"text":"It is my opinion there are no good Chinese restaurants Uptown, and Soho Bistro continues to prove me right.

I have been here two or three times now, and I tend to order the more \"authentic,\" or less popular items such as the beef noodle soup, Japanese ramen, and they have both let me down.

Also, whenever I come here for dinner I am literally the only customer in the dining area. I think that Soho Bistro must really be only a lunch place."}
{"text":"\"Say, Schwan, How's the Chinese Food Around Here?\"

Soho Bistro is exactly what we were looking for - quick and easy predictable Chinese delivery.

\"Quick\" understates the speed of this place.  We called them minutes after placing the order to ask for utensils, and the driver had already left the restaurant (with utensils).

As for \"easy\", you can't beat online ordering that works as well in practice as in theory.

And all the flavors were exactly as they should be - potstickers/dumplings, fried rice, etc.

The food was a little greasier than I would have preferred, but if you order Chinese delivery, that's to be expected.

Confucius say, \"Four tune cookies for Soho Bistro.\"  A little less oil, and Tao/Tso would be a five star general."}
{"text":"I had carryout. Very quick but kinda confusing to find the place. I was expecting good things because the reviews seem to rave about this place but honestly I was really disappointed. The food is mediocre, I have had WAY better and I can't say that anything I had was really that great. I'll be looking for a different chinese place to eat at."}
{"text":"Varied menu from what you usually encounter in an Asian diner. Food was good and portions were the right size."}
{"text":"Tasty appetizers and dishes. Pungent sauces. Quick delivery. Excellent choice for Chinese food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food came out very soon after we ordered. The menu is extensive and has many different options of Thai and Chinese dishes. The menu offers anything from soup to noodle dishes to stir fry. I ordered their spicy soup with shrimp and it was very good and actually spicy and had a lot of veggies in it. The restaurant itself is but small but went during the week and it wasn't crowded at all! I would definitely eat here again and it's very close to the arena!"}
{"text":"Seeing that I'm Asian and originally from NYC, I know what \"authentic Asian food is\". The food by best is subpar and barely mediocre. The lady at the front desk is absolutely RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE. Disgusting phone etiquette and completely APPALLING. Not only that ? I asked for $2 more extra meat. Does 5 slices of beef equal $2 ON TOP of what I originally ordered ? NO. I also asked the rude lady for a side of sriracha, but she purposely gave me hot chili oil. I rarely ever write such negative reviews, but the quality, quantity and disgusting attitude makes me NEVER want to return. They lost out on catering opportunity for my team at B of A as well. So sad."}
{"text":"This restaruant seems like it might be a local character spot. The food however, was so terrible, that my husband and I actaully felt violated somehow!  We went there for breakfast, and we were shocked by the poor quality of our meals. The home fries were fried beyond belief, chewy, hard, potato-less...we might as well have been chewing on plastic. The hollandaise sauce on my eggs benny was congealed!!! It sat rigid, dry, and suspended on top. My husband's bacon was fatty, dry, and tasteless. They serve cheap toast you could probaby by for 79cents a loaf, and the eggs arrived cold and dry. We eat out for breakfast a lot, and understand there can be a wide variance on quality, but we have nevery eaten breakfast that was THIS BAD! At $13/per meal + tax and coffey they don't refill, it was outrageous. We would have done much better eating fast food."}
{"text":"Soho is not on my list of places to go for lunch uptown, but occasionally group lunches leave you no choice, so I end up having to come here once or twice a year and my view of them still has not changed........average."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Noodle soup.  Again, feeling under the weather an want soup.  It far exceeded my expectations.  I used to get chicken rice soup from TinTin and was never impressed.  The chicken there was always a little \"iffy\".  Soho's CNS is delightful.  I was greeted with large broccoli florets, slices of zucchini, bok choy and LOTS of good quality chicken. The chicken had a good texture and was cut-able with a spoon.  I ordered with rice noodles which came nestled in the bottom of the container and were not over done.  The broth was light and full of flavor.  It wasn't too salty and was a delicious end of soup drink.  As a happy bonus I got fried wontons with the soup.  They were large and fresh; A tasty crunch. Once again, Soho Bistro knocks it out of the park!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for the weekend and wanted some good Chinese food. Saw reviews for this place on yelp..was less than impressed.  Everything we ordered was very very bland. And the egg roll had a weird sour flavor. Very disappointed in my Charlotte Chinese. Won't be back."}
{"text":"***BE WARNED! THE ADDRESS IS TRYON STREET BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ON COLLEGE STREET. YOU CANNOT GET HERE FROM TRYON***

Four years after leaving south Charlotte I finally find a Chinese place with reasonable enough prices and good enough food to rival Taipei South!

Everything I've tried at this place is fantastic! Several months back I brought my mom in here for a lunch break while showing her around town and now every time she comes to visit and lunch or dinner time rolls around she wants to go to Soho. It's only the large number of other great restaurants in the area that keeps us from eating here every time. 

The egg rolls are perfectly crispy without being greasy. If you order something with shrimp you actually get a decent amount of shrimp. This alone is enough to make Soho stand out among all the other Chinese restaurants in the same price range and even some that are considerably more expensive."}
{"text":"The lady who answered the phone, has a Nasty attitude!!!! Seriously, why would I spend money to get mistreated? 
Friday night, I ordered food for me and my business partners, after a long day of training for business and a VERY full day ahead of us, we just wanted to have food delivered to us at the hotel, then go to bed. I ordered my food at 8:05 pm, the receptionist quoted that our food would be delivered in 30 minutes...it took a  hour and 45 minutes!!!! After waiting a hour, I called to check on the status of our delivery, the receptionist told me, \"it hasn't been a hour!\", I was flabbergast! Why would she lie to me? What happened to good customer service?! I told her, \"Ma'am, I'm looking at my call times, it's now 9:05.\" She replied, \"well your food's on the way!\". I said, \"Is it en route or are you just saying that?\"....THEN...THE LADY HUNG UP ON ME!!! WHAT??!!!!
If it was just my food, I would have cancelled the order! When the delivery guy came, I snapped and made clear that I would write a scathing review, b/c the receptionist is HORRIBLE! I concluded it was unfair to project on him, my frustrations for his sorry co-worker(his name is Gaston and he was VERY nice actually); I tipped him and sent him on his way! The food was good, too bad morally, I cannot bare to patronize this place again...because phone girl is a heffer! :-)"}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese restaurant in the world. It's not even Chinese. I ordered mapo tofu and it's a stew of medium-firm tofu with bell peppers and white onions. There's no Sichuan peppers or any other spices, just regular chilli peppers. The oil it was cooked in smells rancid. In fact everything that came smells rancid. I also got the \"vegetable tofu soup\" which is a few cabbage leaves, two bean sprouts, 2 pieces of tofu in hot water. Too bad I'm home and can't return it. It smells disgusting."}
{"text":"I rarely eat Chinese and when I do it is a treat. I ordered here based on the good reviews. Firstly, my order took nearly an hour and it was a pick up order. Ordered sesame chicken and crab ragoons. The sesame chicken was so sweet and sugary I could eat no more than two or three pieces. The ragoons were inedible; they did not have that warm creamy mixture you expect. Instead, it was dry and tasteless I know filling. Waste of a cheat meal."}
{"text":"Great little spot with great food and pleasant atmosphere.  Soho Bistro is definitely more of an elevated Chinese cuisine with Cantonese influence. Not quite exactly like the NY style Chinese food I grew up with, but it's definitely a great place to eat and have never been disappointed.

Not only is the food reasonably priced for its higher quality, but the service here is excellent as well. The family who runs this place are friendly people who have always made me feel welcome when I'm there. If anyone hasn't yet tried this place I would definitely recommend giving it a shot while in Uptown."}
{"text":"I agree with a reviewer below, the food was similar to Panda Express. I paid $11 for broccoli and chicken and got a very small portion. Definitely not worth what I paid and I will not return."}
{"text":"I just moved here to Charlotte from NorCal and one of my favorite foods to eat back in Cali was Chinese food.  So I was excited to find this place.  I have to say it does NOT compare to Chinese back at home. 
I ordered potstickers (called dumplings here) and the skin was too thick and there was barely any meat inside.  Not a good first impression. 
I wanted chow mein so I ordered the House Lo Mein...too salty.  They put too much oyster sauce or soy sauce.  This also made the noodles squirmy.  
I ordered broccoli on the side and at least that was good.  
I hope there are better Chinese food spots out here.  Since this place was in Uptown I hope this isnt the best they got...

3 stars because their service was good"}
{"text":"Perfect relax spot, food is affordable and extremely good. I love the general tso chicken with white rice. I have easy eaten at this spot more than 20 times. Parking is free of you park in hersh towers and have them stamp your parking tickets."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese delivery/takeout I've had in my 29 years of existence. Everything I've had was great and everyone that works there is super friendly. Totally worth the price. Most of the meals I've gotten lasted 3+ meals. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best affordable ethnic places to eat in uptown, I think this kicks Basil's butt any day. 

I usually come here for a dinner date, it is usually quiet.

Oh and did I mention the best fried egg rolls I've had. Ever. Fresh crispy crunch, worth having at least once a month if diet is not a question for you."}
{"text":"We had lunch here during a rather unbusy Saturday.  Most places in this area seem to only serve dinner on Saturday so this was one the few seemingly vegan-friendly Saturday lunch spots.

Sad to say, my entree was a little bland. It was a tofu, vegetables, and wide rice noodles entree.  It surely looked spectacular with the varied vibrant colors and large portion size, but it failed to delivery on tastiness!  No bother, I drowned the sucker in chile sauce and soy sauce until it was more edible. The tofu spring rolls appetizer suffered from a similar tastelessness.  

At least service was prompt and everything was salvageable with a little doctoring up.  I suspect that the omnivore dishes may be more palatable as my companion didn't seem bothered, but she is polite gal, so who knows!  The large portion size did permit me to chow down again later, which is always appreciated when I am about to possibly spend all night throwing back drinks, with little or no vegan options immediately available.  

I don't know, I'm willing to gander Soho Bistro is probably not too bad for most diners, but it just didn't do it for me!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard Chinese variety food, exactly what were were looking for. For being uptown the prices and portions were very reasonable. The service was incredibly fast, which I appreciate. They have lots of options on the menu so you really can find something you like, and the classics are of course great. Only gripe would be that the chicken was dark meat for breaded dishes so I'll be sure to order a different meat for those in the future. Definitely will be back, and definitely will recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese Restuant downtown 2 blocks from the Epicenter .  I first ordered take out from here and it was so good I had to try dining in and yes it was even better.  

We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese and modern quiet atmosphere.  The service was excellent as well, thanks to Yan.  Strongly recommend the Soho Platter."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Coming from NY where I've been spoiled with great chinese food, SoHo Bistro is the best that I've found in charlotte.  Their prices are very reasonable too.  The servers are sweet and great.  We came in with a party of 13 and the waitress memorized everyone's orders (and drinks).  I was quite surprised when everything came back perfect.  I would definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"This is what an authentic Chinese restaurant is. I discovered this bistro in Uptown on a walk back in 2013, not a week after I got food poisoning from another Chinese restaurant two blocks away from this location. The price is extremely reasonable, the food is excellent and the customer service is top-notch, with a beautiful touch of Chinese characteristics."}
{"text":"We have been customers of Soho Bistro for 11 years.  Their food is always fresh and delicious. The service is exceptional and with dozens of take out orders in these 11 years everything is always accurate.  The restaurant is very kid friendly but also a great place for a business lunch."}
{"text":"I ordered several items for take out. I very rarely have American Chinese cuisine, and I was pleasantly surprised - food was overall pretty tasty. The kitchen was also really fast in making the food after I ordered. I would recommend if you want quick service. My one complaint is that their fortune cookies do not taste good..."}
{"text":"I love this place! I started going here when I was doing my internship with the Bobcats. It's a 5 minute walk from the arena. Everyone is so friendly and the food is great not to mention cheap! I never spent more than $8 on lunch. The chicken and broccoli is by far my favorite thing on the menu. If you're going for lunch, I would plan on taking a late one cause they are always packed during the week. Between 1:30 and 2:00 is when it dies down and is a little bit quieter."}
{"text":"Ew. Ordered a Mongolian beef. All I got was almost 2 lbs of sautéed onions on a greasy saúde which was completely different from the Mongolian beef you can find anywhere else. That came with perhaps 5 small pieces of beef. My dish either has a wrong description online, the chef or I don't have a good understanding of what's a Mongolian beef. Reminding my understanding was based on previous experiences from different places ordering the same dish... In addition the recipe as well the website dish's description called for scallions which I didn't receive a single one. A complete disappointment. Would never order from it again."}
{"text":"WOW! Very good food!!!!! The wait staff was very friendly and quick!  I always love the sharing family style of chinese restaurants!  You must go here!!! AWESOME PLACE!!!!!  And the person who suggested the donuts!!! THANK YOU!!!! THEY WERE AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand with all the bad review from people about this place because I've found this place only about six months ago and my family and I have been here for quite a few times.  We enjoyed the food very much and the price is unbelievable good.  The service is great too.  We even took our oversea family from England here and they loved it too.  So, two thumbs up from us!!!"}
{"text":"Always amazing. Food is way above the average Chinese restaurant. Real Quality here! And the ladies who work there are super sweet and always so nice! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First for the price and portions downtown I don't know if you'll find better value. All the ingredients are fresh. Service was fantastic. The dumpling sauce is tasty! Would reccomend."}
{"text":"Great Chinese in uptown that actually stays open on the weekends! The women who own and manage Soho are very pleasant and welcoming. They recognize regulars and make you feel special. Tip: online ordering available. 

I have been to Soho for both work lunches and weekend takeout. I have never had a bad experience. The portions are large and the prices are fair. I usually go with the Kung Pao chicken or Mongolian beef; classic Americanized recipes. I appreciate the plentiful amount of peanuts they use in the Kung Pao. 

They are experts at the lunch rush hour - I can be seated, served, and billed all around 30 minutes. You can tell they have been doing this a while. 

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place has been a steady lunch time to-go option for years.
The food is always consistent for me and right on time when I order it online. I like the Lo Mein, General Tso's and Sesame Chicken as well as a few other things I've had. I look forward to trying their Ramen when it's colder.

Years ago I would pick up a meal and meet my friends for lunch elsewhere. I used to always ask for a cup of water to take with me. After about a year and half of working elsewhere, I came back to Uptown and put in an online order but forgot to add the water (always had to write the request in the instructions. However, even after the time away, they somehow remembered me and my usual cup of water was waiting for me. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular visitor of Soho practically since they opened, which is probably close to 10 years ago at this point.

In all of my travels around the world, Soho's chinese food is just about at the top of the charts.  They use fresh ingredients, have a fantastic staff, and will alter any dish to your likings.  They have an extensive vegetarian menu, and also will make the standard meat dishes vegetarian.

Ownership and staff is top-notch. It's not your run of the mill chinese place with generic sauces and formerly-frozen veggies.  Everything is fresh and wonderful."}
{"text":"Looking for authentic Chinese food? If so, then you'll want to take a pass on this place. I found the food to be bland and lacking in any kind of flavor--even the Szechuan dishes.  The dumplings are doughy and heavy-disappointing. I gave it two stars because the waitress was friendly and funny and the Jasmine tea was nice."}
{"text":"Soho Bistro is great Chinese food at a great price. I used to get take-out from here every couple of weeks when I worked uptown. I make it by there less frequently now, but I have been back a few times. It's worth the trip!

My favorite lunch special is the Cantonese rice noodles without the chicken and shrimp. It's spicy, and it seems healthy. I'm sure it's cooked in a lot of oil, but it's a healthier option that a lot of the quick lunch alternatives.

It can get crowded at Soho for lunch, so we usually ordered online or called in and went to pick it up. Parking can be kind of a pain in this area of uptown, so we usually took two people in the car and left one to wait while the other ran inside.

Another great reason for going to Soho if you're ordering with an office is that it's located pretty close to the PIta Pit and the uptown Fuel. We'd sometimes stop at all three to get something for everybody.

The prices are good, and the service is quick and friendly. I've never been let down by Soho."}
{"text":"This would have to be the best Chinese food I've had in Charlotte, which isn't saying a whole ton, but it was solid. Not busy at all on a Wednesday night. Service was quick enough. Located at the backside of the building, so not really on N Tryon St. 

Had the Shrimp and Chive Dumpling appetizer and definitely satisfies any craving for leek I've had, but definitely too oily. Had the Spicy Thai Curry with Tofu and it was flavorful and wonderfully spicy! Also tried the Garlic Shrimp and Scallop dish, which was also nicely flavored. 

Felt weird eating Chinese food with a fork, so I asked for a pair of chopsticks, but the chopsticks were crap, you know the kind that break apart at a strange place and taste like chemically treated wood. Bah! 

Overall a good place to soothe my major Chinese food cravings!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  They have a great dish called tangerine chicken - it is so good.  Their scallion pancakes are great also.  If you plan on coming here during lunch arrive early - this place gets crowded and has a wait.  Dinner time it isnt so bad and you can usually score a table pretty quickly.  It is good chinese food and not too bad on the wallet!"}
{"text":"Got chicken lo mein and tangerine beef with fried rice. We enjoyed the chicken lo mein but the beef was way too heavily breaded and some big pieces had NO meat in it. The fried rice had no veggies in it and smelled like it was made from stale rice. We let the server know the situation and he offered new rice but we declined and he went to tell the chef but nothing was done by the management to fix the situation. We will be spending our hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Typical, quick in and quick out style Chinese food joint.  I've only had the lunch here and each time I've been pleased.  Portion sizes are a bit large and they keep the drinks coming.  Avoid getting a soda here, they tend to be flat.  I think they just buy 2 liters probably.  Service is always quick, almost too quick, they love to push the check to the table ASAP.  I understand that though because this place does get pretty packed during lunch."}
{"text":"This place needs consistency.

Ordered delivery on 2 nights and while the first night's order was a big success (spicy ramen and mapo tofu), the second night was unbelievably terrible. My colleague ordered curry noodles and it had NO taste/salt in it whatsoever, and their $5.95 dessert cakes are small pieces of store-bought cakes that were horribly overcharged."}
{"text":"Our server was very polite and sweet. Service took forever and felt like she was not paying any attention to us. vegetables were soggy and old. eggs were sock hard and cover in crud. 
wouldn't even go back for a drink."}
{"text":"If you haven't had the eggplant dish, you're missing out. I was craving some non-green veggies and it totally hit the spot. I wiped the whole plate clean. 

One disappointing thing to note is that the eggrolls are horrible. :( How can you mess that up at a chinese restaurant? The filling seemed to be made out of leftover scraps (tiny bitty pieces of ground meat (or not meat? i couldn't even tell), and barely any cabbage). It did not taste good at all no matter how much duck sauce I poured to cover the weird taste."}
{"text":"If only the food was as good as the look of the restaurant and the service....

We had five people, and the bill came out to $145. Yikes.

We ordered the potato leek and garlic soup, which tasted more like pepper and watery potato leek essence than anything else. It was slightly improved by adding a bit of cheese. The bowl was also very shallow, and not worth the price we paid. Especially considering the taste.

I ordered a salad which looked nice, however lacked in any main flavor, kick, or any feeling of refreshment and nice crunch from anything. The ingredients seemed fresh, however it just couldn't come together. It was topped with a mango \"salsa\" which turned out just to be cubed mango bits. As a native of Los Angeles, I take issue with this definition of salsa.

I ordered a pasta with lemon creme sauce and sliced tomatoes. Salmon was supposed to have been part of the original dish, however I requested that it stay out. The dish wasn't badly cooked, it was just supremely bland. They could have at least added basil or capers to disguise this inherent flavour-void or something.

I tried my sister's mushroom ravioli. It too was remarkably bland. My grandmother's vegetables were also very plainly steamed, and the piece of salmon she had paid a hefty price for was very skinny and thin. I would not have charged more than $9 for the dish- sadly we paid more than double that. At that price, we expected the vegetables to have been done with more care or perhaps lightly buttered, and for the salmon piece to have been far larger and jucier.

My brother's fish and chips were okay. They should make more of that sort of thing, since pasta and fish are obviously not strong points here.

It was sort of remarkable how bland the food was...I mean, it was actually an achievement to me, how lacking in anything good or bad it was. The chef didn't suffer some sort of muscle spasm which caused him to add too much sage or whatever to the food- it's like he was afraid to add it at all.

I really want to see what goes on back there. Are they running chronically low in their spice cabinet? Is the chef keeping this tastiness to himself? Is there a secret word I must utter to get spiced food? The world may never know.

Anyways, after the meal, we asked them for tiramisu. They had none. I was very disappointed, seeing as this is my favourite Italian desserts, though I am admitedly very poor in my knowledge of those desserts....yet I was sort of glad they didn't have a chance to mess this up too.

I would definitley not come back here."}
{"text":"I just called  our delivery order in after ringing MANY local establishments that do not deliver. Their customer service is friendly and quick"}
{"text":"I can't imagine how this place has 4 stars.  The only good thing is that the order was actually correct - which is always a concern with delivery.  Fried dumplings were thick and mushy.  The actual flavor of the inside was good but the texture was off-putting.  The ramen soup was bland.  Lo mein was below average.  Egg roll was sour of all things.  Hot and sour soup also bland.  I would not eat here again based on this experiance."}
{"text":"the appetizers are great. i had the soup and spinach dip, and both were delicious. the main courses were mediocre. i wasn't impressed with the pasta dish.

the service was very friendly and always checking up."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Charlotte on a business trip from STL and have been craving some Chinese like crazy! This place is right across the street from my hotel but after a long day I just didn't feel like evening my room. I used their online ordering system which is super-easy and user friendly. Food arrived not even 20 minutes later on a Friday night. The beef with broccoli was in a plastic fridge/microwave-friendly to-go box and the crab wontons are delicious; not overly cream-cheesy. I'm here for two more weeks and will definitely be ordering again. Reasonably priced as well. ONLY bummer: they don't have Moo-Shoo Pork :-("}
{"text":"Me, the fine newcomer Elizabeth A. and Heather X., went here on a rainy Friday at 330pm and I left wanting to come back the next day.

They still were serving lunch at 330 which ROCKED for moi, who is a chronic late luncher since my job lets me sleep in a bit :) Parking in the Hearst Tower lot is the best idea since they validate your ticket, so be sure to bring it in with you!

A smaller place than I expected, there's a great, mellow vibe here. The lights that hang over the tables are beautifully warm with medium colored wood and soft white bulbs inside frosted glass. While empty when we arrived, I can definitely see this place being crowded at lunchtime between 1130-130 so heads up on that! Calling it in seemed to be a pretty good option and one that was utilized alot while we were there!

Starting off with crab ragoons and asian fresh rolls, we shared and IMO the crab ragoons really shone about and beyond. The fresh rolls were good, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce they came with (reminded me of an Indian fig sort of thick sauce) and the duck sauce wasn't meshing well with it either.

I ordered the General Tofu and while I feel like I'm piggy-backing onto Elizabeth's review, it was true that the tofu was PERFECT. I mean, HOLYYYY MOTHER THIS IS PERFECT. From the fry (not overly but not soggy under), to the sauce (I asked for it extra spicy, and they delivered!), to the picking of your own veggie (I choose brocoli which came out not mushy, not stiff but the almost unreachable middle ground) and the delish spring roll (something is added to this that is not in most - no clue what but it makes it hearty but still light).

The service was attentive, kind and accommodating, the space was intimate yet casual and the food was stellar. That's a WIN WIN WIN in my book! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was definitely underwhelmed with this food. The service was super quick and it was delivered to me in less than 30 minutes (I only live 4 or 5 blocks from the place).
The sesame chicken was decent. It was the best part of the meal. The spring roll was tasty but the egg roll was blah.
I did not enjoy the house lo mein. The meat in it was gray and chewy. It lacked any flavor. The beef and broccoli also had a very strange taste to it....almost lemony? 
Overall, I will not be coming back to SoHo Bistro. I ordered from them for the convenience but I'd prefer to drive somewhere and get decent Chinese food."}
{"text":"Ordered some take out on Sunday night. 
I would actually give this place 3.5 stars if it allowed me to.

I ordered the following:
Wonton noodle soup 3/5
Chicken lo Mein 4/5
Egg rolls 4/5 good but small
Chicken with broccoli 2/5 -- this is usually my go to and I was pretty disappointed. Chicken and broccoli were cooked fine, but the sauce was very \"pinkish/orangish\" vs the standard darker brown sauce in accustomed to. It just didn't taste right. Idk how else to explain it.


I will give them another shot next time I want Chinese take out. It will ultimately let me know if I will continue to order from there, or if I need to start looking for a new takeout spot."}
{"text":"Visited Charlotte during my vacation and must say this is one of the nicest more friendly people I met during my road trip and the service at this restaurant was par to none.  My server was very polite and helpful.  My comment to her after passing the menu right back to her was \"Suprise Me\".
   What she started me off with perfectly stuffed fresh spring rolls.  I have had rolls from many asian restaurants, but non had this much shrimp inside.  Being use to other places that slice the shrimp and put less than half at times in the roll.  These were filled very nice and had great flavor.
   She kept my tea glass full, which might I add I did not use any sugar.  It was fresh and tasted right.
   My entree came out and it was pepper beef I think.  Crispy beef.  Great flavor, done so well with great seasoning and the rice was tender and nice.
   I thoroughly enjoyed this visit to this business.  Stop in and enjoy."}
{"text":"My family's go to restaurant. Been coming here for over 10 years! Love the owners, they remember us each time. Delicious house fried rice, fried calamari, egg rolls, and more!"}
{"text":"I tried it the first time I visited Charlotte because it was across from my hotel. Great service great food and lots of menu choices.
It was both family-friendly and date family-though not when my family is there! 
Very good spot with great variety!"}
{"text":"This has been my go-to spot for the last 10 years!  The food and service are always consistent and I love the quick and easy online order option as well as the ambiance when dining in.  My favorite dishes are the crab wontons, teriyaki chicken, pineapple chicken fried rice, vegetable fried rice, sesame chicken or the sauteed mixed vegetables when I feel like walking on the vegetarian side.  They're great for lunch or dinner and the owners (which are twins) are always so personable!"}
{"text":"Neat little Chinese bistro in the heart of Uptown. Service was excellent and the atmosphere is intimate. 

I'm guessing this is a Hong Kong style place? A fair mix of Cantonese and Mandarin dishes, including some Curry Noodles, Cantonese Rice Noodles, Sha Cha Chicken and a ton of seafood dishes including (!) Mahi Mahi.

I went with the Cantonese Noodles and they were around a B/B+. I think they could have made the noodles much spicier and gone heavier on the seasonings. My friend ordered a General Tso's Tofu, which was delightfully crispy and sweet on the outside but perfectly soft on the inside. He also ordered the Teriyaki Chicken appetizer which was served satay-style on a skewer. This again was good, though fairly dumbed-down for what (I assume) the owners think is a spice-averse audience in Charlotte.

So, in spite of the good review, my message to SoHo is this: DON'T BE AFRAID TO MAKE THE FOOD MORE AUTHENTIC. BE BRAVE! Look, you might be thinking most Americans want bland Chinese food - but, the times, they are a changin'. There are a ton of culturally educated, adventurous foodies out there and they are DYING for legit Chinese cuisine. Go forth and give us a place to call home!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice in the restaurant.  We had a very tentative waiter all the way until it was time for the check.  He never came back to the table after dropping off the check.  I wonder if he was telling us that the food was free because it was just OK?  Well, when the gal at the front saw me looking around she finally came by to get the check.  Then we ordered a to go lunch which took forever.  Come to find out it was already sitting at the front waiting.  I caught the same girls eyes which is when she finally motioned that the food was there already.  Really? You couldn't come over to the table to tell us?  I can see why she wouldn't hand the to go food to us before we paid but at least tell me it is there already.

The food was just OK.  Considering I live in California where we have a lot of true Asian restaurants.  I ordered the noodle soup with egg noodles and the noodles they used were the  fat noodles rather than the thin egg noodles which is what you would normally see in a true Asian restaurant.  It had a good flavor but fat noodles do not do anything for me.  Then I thought, let me try their house fried rice. I normally judge the Chinese Restaurant by the presentation of their house fried rice.  Have you ever ordered a regular fried rice from a Chinese restaurant?  Normally the regular fried rice they just in a frying pan add some soy sauce and that's it.  This was they also added some meat, shrimp and bean sprouts.  I wonder if I should give them my recipe for Yang Chow Fried Rice?  The house fried rice flavor was just OK and I would not call it anything better.  

Just OK food is exactly what it is.  There you have it."}
{"text":"Great customer service. I had a hard time finding good places to eat in the Uptown area, visiting Charlotte. I live in the DC area, and it's hard to find quality service in the restaurant industry. I think this place was on point with service, food and scenery. When I come back to visit, I will be coming here"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat uptown before a show that is fast and hast decent food?  Well you may want to check out Soho Bistro.

This restaurant is located in the Hearst Tower but the entrance is on College Street across from the Holiday Inn and Merts.  

The place has nice decor, the seating is a little uncomfortable though.  Chairs are the right height but the tables seemed low.

The menu has plenty of selections for meat eaters and vegetarians.  There are like 40 (exageration) types of soup and several appetizers.  Portions are huge!

On a visit before a concert at Spirit Square, I had the Chicken with Garlic Sauce with brown rice.  The presentation was outstanding with a carrot in ribbon form displayed on my plate for color.  The chicken dish had peppers and other veggies is a light brown sauce.  Unfortunately, this was supposed to be a spicy dish.  Why is it so hard for Chinese restaurants to do spicy?  On a scale of 1 to five on spice, this was about a 1/2.   Flavor was ok, I just wanted heat!  

Prices are great for what you get and the staff is super friendly here.  Our waiter had to ask twice on what I ordered and still missed the brown rice. But he was great at refilling water glasses."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open for over 10 years,  and the food and staff has been great and very consistent.  My favorite is the Tangerine Chicken,  and my wife loves their Honey Walnut Shrimp. I've never been disappointed with my food."}
{"text":"I went during lunch time, i gets really busy so go around 11:30. Cheap for lunch, but I have had better Chinese food. But it's good for the price you get. I ordered Kung Pao Tofu with fried Rice, and it came with a springroll."}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick, relatively authentic Chinese lunch in a nicer setting. I had the Beef Chow Foon, which was pretty good, just a tad salty. Very reasonable price though and service was extremely friendly and fast. They validate parking in the Hearst Tower."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I had heard rave reviews so I finally decided to check it out for some takeout. Soho Bistro is run by the nicest people and the food was delicious. Not too greasy/heavy, and the fried pork dumplings were awesome. The food was ready really quickly, too. Definitely coming back here whenever I want Chinese!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim for lunch with a friend for her birthday. 

We went at 12:00 and were immediately seated.  I was surprised they weren't busier!!  I wanted something healthy.  I told the waiter chicken and veggies grilled or steamed.  He brought me the chicken and veggie steamer with the sauce on the side.  My friend went with the chicken and broccoli .

My steamer plate was so  delicious and healthy.  I was excited because I wasn't expecting it at all .

The lunch menu prices are really reasonable and the service is quick!"}
{"text":"First pointer: Although the address says N. Tryon, the entrance to this place is on College St (back side of Hearst Tower) so you can decide where to park. We parked at Church and 5th thinking it was just around the corner but then had to walk two blocks which wasn't a pleasant walk on our way back from dinner when it got chilly and rainy.

Ambiance: Intimate. Soft lighting and pleasant music. We went at a time when the restaurant wasn't crowded. Only 4 tables were occupied, but I believe this place must be packed for lunch.

Service was courteous and our food arrived in reasonable time. Our server kept our glasses full.

We ordered the Summer Roll and Hot and Sour Soup. The Summer Rolls were as good as any others (they all taste the same) but the veggies were fresh. The Hot and Sour soup was good (we split it). For the entree we had the Mongolian chicken, which was mind blowing. It had just the right amount of spice, hot enough to open up my blocked sinuses, but not overly spicy. The flavors perfectly melded. The portions were large enough. Me and my boyfriend left the place with full tummies and some leftover Mongolian chicken."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for an egg roll one day. Sometimes these things happen. If you don't judge me, I won't judge you. I poked around on my Yelp App until I found a decent place near to where I was lurking that day. Soho Bistro has a rather fancy website that I found I couldn't resist!

I ordered a few things, because you can't just get egg rolls. What about when you are also craving crab rangoon? And, hey, look they've got honey walnut prawns on the menu. Seaweed salad? That sounds healthful, and I tend to like seaweed. Let's do it!

- Egg rolls - straightforward. did the job.
- Crab rangoon - really really mushy and had.. carrot in there? shredded carrot? I can't say I liked it.
- Honey walnut prawns - No. They were fried and came in a thick brown sauce with vegetables. This is not what it's supposed to look like. These were definitely NOT the droids I was looking for.
- Seaweed salad - Awesome, if a bit plain. I could have done without the pointless bed of shredded lettuce on the bottom. But the seaweed itself was awesome.
- Sauce - The sweet and sour sauce that generally comes with the fried goodies was really weird here. It was really dark red and syrupy, and did not taste very pleasant. I can't recommend it.

Huge bonus points for 
1. having a great website 
2. having a menu on the website. 
3. being able to order online. 
4. having a REALLY awesome staff person answer the phone, answer questions, and even brought my food to the curb before I even slowed to a stop.

The place is definitely different, but I'm willing to give some of the other stuff a try. Being Chinese, I'm really picky about my Chinese food, and I've already rejected most of the other joints in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. Great food whether you are dining in, ordering take out or delivery. Service is excellent: very friendly staff and food is delivered promptly. Menu selection is authentic and has a lot of choices. Whenever I am in Charlotte, I always make sure I have at least one meal at Soho Bistro."}
{"text":"Is there a decent, authentic Chinese restaurant in Uptown?  Soho reminds me of a Panda Express / mall kiosk kitchen with seating.  Food is bland.  I mean, if the Hot and Sour soup is neither Hot nor Sour, what am I eating?  Had the Kung Pao Tofu hoping it was something different from the Sweet and Sour Chicken, General Tao Chicken standards.  Didn't help.  

Please, please recommend better alternatives Uptown."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese take-out/delivery spots I've found in Charlotte. Can't speak to the dine-in experience. 

Like many Chinese restaurants, their spiciness scale could use some calibration--the food is never as spicy as I'd like. 

However, the flavors and quality more than makes up for that. They are very speedy and the food is always cooked to perfection (no over-cooked, mushy veggies like you'll get at some places). The meat and produce is always good quality and I really like that they don't drown their dishes in sauce."}
{"text":"A solid place for some good American Chinese food! I came here for lunch and was quite happy with my Sha Cha Beef & Shrimp!"}
{"text":"I was teetering between 3 stars and 4 stars, but went with 4 stars!

Came here during lunch hour with co-workers to grab a birthday lunch - nothing super-fancy, but something solid.  I appreciated it since no one likes to go eat lunch wif me *sniffle* (They all pack their own lunches or don't eat - \"Lunch is for wimps!).  But yesterday, I had lunch buddies, yay!

We all had the lunch special which came out in a timely manner and the place was poppin'.  It was a birthday, so I asked the manager/server if they had anything special for birfdays, she said No.  I said, okay, makes sense - who comes here for birthday lunch.  I ordered a chocolake cake though anyways.  

Lunch was solid, maybe a little on the sweet side.  I had the chicken/shrimp/mixed vegetables and the sauce was a little sweet.  General Tsao's chicken (?) was also a little sweet my buddy said.  Oh yeah, AVOID the innocuous looking mustard bottle.  It's not your average mustard sauce that comes in the little packets from Chinese restaurants.  This one was sinus-clearing, eyes-water, fire-breathing. Yeah, it was so hot.

At the end, they brought out the cake.  Low and behold, it had a witto candle on top which the manager/owner had to keep from blowing out with the wine glass (damn, asian people are smart!).  It was a nice way to end the impromptu birfday lunch.

Will I go here again?  Prob after I've dated a GF for a few months. It's a dimly lit, quaint comfortable Chinese food spot - like a solid 8th dinner date or a 4-year-been-with-the-ball-&-chain(wifey)-and-we-need-to-pretend-we-still-have-romantic-dates place. 

dmo out."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've had in a while. This place use to be good, not sure what happened?"}
{"text":"Lunch time!  A few co-workers and I ventured over to Soho last week for lunch.  So close to my former work space, and CROWDED if you go right at noon.  The tables seem to turn fast, but I'd recommend going before or after the lunch rush.  We had to wait a good 10 minutes for a table that could hold a group of 4 people.  We had two more peeps, but we needed to take what we could get.  After being seated, a bigger table opened up and asked if we could move so all 6 of us could sit together.  They kindly said we could!

Ordered the garlic shrimp dish and it was so good!  Food came out about 10 to 15 minutes after ordering! Prices are decent for the portion size.  

Small interior and cramped tables.  Wouldn't recommend for parties over 4 if you are going at lunch."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Holiday Inn for a business trip and this place was within walking distance.  For convenience, I actually had food from Soho twice during my short trip.  They were A-OK... is the best I can describe it.  Is the food hot and fresh, yes.  Is it very yummy... eh, not really.  I've tried a duck dish, a kung pao chicken dish, wonton soup, fried rice.  Nothing was bad, but nothing wow'd me either.  So, given the location and price point, I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I have never had better Chinese food. The food was fresh and no hint of MSG. The location is fantastic and centrally located to everything. It is small and intimate and they even offer vegetarian meals. I had the Lo Mein and it was so delicious. They offer drinks as well including beer and wine. The staff there is so friendly and the wait for our meal was minimal. The food was so delicious I've gone back again and again introducing it to friends and they love it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Ordered some delivery from here while I was in Charlotte for work. The food was delivered quickly and it was actually pretty good, if not run of the mill.  I ordered the spring rolls, scallion pancakes and house special lo-mein.  The spring rolls were pretty tasty although I didnt have enough dipping sauce for all 3 of them.  The scallion pancakes were unlike any I have seen before and almost seemed on the edge of burnt but they were edible if not a little tough.

The house special lo-mein was quite tasty and had lots of good crunchy veggies in it to complement the shrimp, chicken and beef but I just didn't go \"WoW!\" this is really good, it just seemed ok.

I would order from here again if I stayed at the same hotel just outside of downtown and it was a rainy night, otherwise I might venture back downtown in search of more satisfying grub."}
{"text":"Summary: Always nice. Always fast. Always good. They stay open until 10 now.

Important for me: They have brown rice and don't charge extra for it. 

I'm impressed by how fast this place can be. I walked in on a weekend night and the place was packed. People were waiting for tables to empty. I just wanted some takeout. I was expecting a longer than normal wait. But no. Five minutes or so after walking in, I had a bag in my hand full of piping hot food and was walking back to the office. 

I have limited options - for health reasons - on what I can order, so I should not be the last word on the menu in any place. So I have mainly stuck to some of the healthier items like Sa Cha chicken or the steamer plates. Even though it's fast, it's always good. (Side note: That level of consistency beats the hell out of just about any \"fast-food\" restaurant I have ever been in.)"}
{"text":"Pretty good overall. I ordered a spring roll and an egg roll - both were a little bland (and greasy) for my taste. 
The steamed veggies were perfectly cooked - a combination of broccoli , zucchini, carrots, sugar peas, and napa cabbage. (Heavy on the broccoli.) The white rice that came with my steamed veggies was also perfectly cooked. 
I also tried the teriyaki chicken skewers - the flavor was excellent, as was the quality of the chicken (lean breast meat) - unfortunately it was a tad dry. I enjoyed it by adding an excess of dipping sauce :) I would try this restaurant again if I'm in the mood for Chinese food.  
*On a side note, be aware that your delivery may not arrive when you request - my delivery came 25 min PRIOR to my requested time... just as I was getting out of the shower- yikes :)"}
{"text":"Old reliable. This place knows how to fit my lunch needs in a major way. I try to get here atleast once a week. They have some of the best chinese food in town.

The twins that work the front are awesome and transition everybody in and out as efficiently as possible. They have yet to mess up my order, despite being extremely overcrowded.

The food is tremendous and fresh. Their edimames are to die for. The steam them and salt them to perfection. If you are uptown and are craving chinese food, go to soho bistro.

7 on the legitimate big dog scale here. This place is as reliable as you can ever imagine. That's what's good."}
{"text":"So, we decided to enjoy Soho today, during the lunch rush, ugh! The place was very crowded, but as others mentioned the service is definitely quick, a little too quick.  We all chose different entrees, which included rice, white, brown, or fried, and a spring roll. I ordered the Chicken & Shrimp with vegetables, and fried rice. The spring roll was a little disappointing, no real filler.  As for the veggies and chicken, delish, but skimpy on the baby shrimp, will pass on that option next time. And, unfortunately I was given brown rice, or maybe it was fried, if so, not great, and on the colder side. Overall, it is a quick lunch, with good prices, but nothing stood out in my mind."}
{"text":"I last reviewed Soho Bistro in mid-2011, and last night my young daughter and I popped in there for dinner before a show.  I thought I'd provide an updated review!

The place is still awesome.  The atmosphere is still peaceful and quiet, and the wait staff efficient and polite.

We ordered four items off the menu: scallion pancakes, crab wontons, tangerine chicken and sesame shrimp.  The scallion pancakes were just as good as they ever were.  The crab wontons were a bit disappointing - we were expecting something closer to crab Rangoon (based on the description) but these are more grainy than creamy.  The filling almost looked like cous cous or quinoa.  Despite this, we ate all but two of them, so they were still good.

My tangerine chicken was OUTSTANDING.  From first bite to last, it was delicious and is my new favorite thing.  My daughter's sesame shrimp was also delicious (she let me have a bite) although she thought it was a little too sweet.

Staff was quick to refill drinks throughout the meal, and our total bill for dinner was $38 - a relative bargain considering we had two appetizers, two entrees and multiple refills on my daughter's soda.  

I continue to recommend this place for good Chinese food at a great price.  Can't wait until my next event uptown so that I can dine here again!"}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful environment. Not super authentic but as far as Americanized Chinese food goes this place was super good. Also lots of veggie options and sizable quantities."}
{"text":"We ordered the lunch fried rice to go last week and were pleasantly surprised by Soho, definitely want to come in for a sit down dinner. We really wanted to sit down for lunch but, didn't feel like we were dressed. I wasn't too hungry so we ordered a chicken fried rice to split for about $6-7. The food came out pretty quickly while we waited at the bar. The place was pretty packed for lunch service also. The container held a good amount of fried rice, a better deal than the Asian place off of trade street we get curry rice from. It was very flavorful! Had the perfect amount of spice for me, extra spicy! 

Will be back for sure, cheers!"}
{"text":"The name doesn't sound like a Chinese restaurant, but it is.  It is located in the heart of downtown Charlotte and is open for lunch and dinner every day.  Cloth napkins, relaxed quiet atmosphere, excellent food well presented and outstanding attentive service.  Lunch menu in the $8 range.  We've eaten in a lot of Chinese restaurants; this is our all time favorite.

{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Hands down! I always eat here and bring anyone from out of town to this restaurant! I've never had anyone complain about anything here. Love love love it! Customer service is superb!"}
{"text":"I love Soho Bistro. I've eaten here for years, but never written a review. The staff here is super nice and the food has always been excellent. Like I say, I've eaten here off and on for over 10 years and never been disappointed. They are a great place for lunch takeout if you work downtown. And they are great for an intimate dinner at night. Also, fine to bring your old kids here also. All the dishes I've had are very tasty, with reasonable portion sizes."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place one day. The food was really great and fast. The setting was cozy. everything from the lighting to waitstaff made for an enjoyable meal. In the busy Uptown area, it's nice to know I can grab a quick lunch that I know will be great. Everything on the lunch menu is in the $5-$7 dollar range so, it won't hurt the wallet either! The location right next to Time Warner Cable makes Soho a great stop after a Bobcats game!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese you'll find in Charlotte by far! Hands down my go to on certain nights. They deliver to uptown and very close ends of South End. Expect 1 hour delivery."}
{"text":"- Spring roll was good
- Crab ragoon was good
- I ordered beef and shrimp sha cha extra spicy... it was not spicy but it was good my wife ate most of it
- my wife got the curry noodles and i ate most of hers

Was not happy with the bug i saw on my check but it wasn't on my food so I'm still good!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I stopped in here for dinner because we wanted something easy and this was across the street from our hotel.  It was pretty quiet when we arrived but busier as the night progressed.

We ordered some edamame to start.  The server recommended that we dip them in a mix of chili sauce and soy sauce.  I hadn't tried that before but I really appreciated the extra flavor punch.  

I had the Soho Twin Delight which was a combo plate of Sesame Shrimp and Spicy Sha-cha Beef.  The dish was beautifully plated.  Both parts of the dish were well-seasoned.  It was served with a large pot of rice that was well-cooked.

The banter with our server was great and perfect for dinner at the end of a long day.  I'd recommend Soho Bistro for a good dinner/lunch if you're in the area."}
