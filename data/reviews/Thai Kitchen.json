{"text":"Great little restaurant. Not to many tables and its byob, which is awesome. We had the Pad Thai and the coconut curry noodles and it was absolutely fantastic. I would absolutely recommend this on a cool day when you want to warm up!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say our experience was completely different than the rest of the Yelpers.  Save yourself from a bad meal and skip this place.  Go to any of the other local Thai places.  I recommend Brown Sugar.  Take out food was terrible.  Pad See Ew was made with the wrong (cheap) noodles.  The sauce was bland and watery.  There was only broccoli stems in it.  Crispy spring rolls were grease bombs.  The lady who took my order quoted 45 minutes for it to be ready.  We got a call 15-20 minutes later saying the food was ready.  Unfortunately we were planning on picking up at the time originally quoted, as we live 20 minutes away.  When I told that to the male employee who called, he said the food would stay warm in the containers, and at least they let us know hat the food was done, other restaurants would not.  The employee was dismissive and did not care to be accountable for the pick up time originally provided."}
{"text":"Very nice first visit. The waitress was very friendly and helpful with recomendations. The food was prepared fresh and quickly.  The lunch menu was comped of 10 different dishes. My wife had the Spicy Basil rice with chicken while I went with a recommendation from the waitress. I was so busy enjoying it i forgot the name of the dish. Both my wife and myself enjoyed the food. It was delicious. I will definitely be coming back to check out the other lunch items and the dinner items as well"}
{"text":"Thai Kitchen has easily become one of my go-to spots for spicy hot comfort food.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  They are very accomodating and gracious hosts.  The place is tiny (maybe 8 tables at most), but it has a nice vibe and you can see them making the food in the kitchen.  You can always get your order to go if you don't want to dine in.  Cash only, but its worth the stop to the ATM beforehand.  I'm a sucker for the spring rolls, Tom Kar - coconut chicken soup and Pad Curry Powder.  But I can assume everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"Sooooooo slow! Granted it was a Saturday night for dinner, but still. It took about 35 minutes for me to get a TomKah soup, no meat. I ordered a sweet sticky rice with mango to go and that only took 25 minutes. The soup was mediocre. The rice in my dessert was greenish color and not so sweet. I opted to go here because it was super close but as long as I had to wait, I could have driven down to my favorite Thai Spices on Main and Dobson, and I probably would have still been done sooner! I didn't taste many of their menu items but from what I did have I would say this.. If you are used to great Thai food, don't go here."}
{"text":"First time here and we will definitely be coming back. Great food, friendly staff, clean atmosphere. Had the Panaeng Curry, Pad Thai, and Thai fried rice. Highly recommend anything here!"}
{"text":"Thai Kitchen was AMAZING. It was clean, with friendly staff, and quick service. My family and I tried the yellow curry (my favorite out of what I tried), sweet & sour pork, Thai fried rice, and potstickers. Everything was fragrant and delicious. I have a pretty high spice tolerance, but the medium spice level was good enough for me. I would recommend trying lower spice levels first. I already can't wait to come back! I also thought the lunch special was a great deal, and the portions were big. 11/10"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and it's amazing! One of the best Thai food restaurants that I have been too. I normally get the coconut shrimp which is delicious and also the red curry mild. I have tried the red curry medium and its a lot spicier than other Thai food places. So remember that when you tell them the level of spicy that it's all spicier than other Thai places. But other than that the food is always amazing!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that this is by no means a fancy restaurant. Thai Kitchen is a place for Date Night, not a first date.   The location is the size of the average Bay Village closet, which is to say around 1000 square feet. You will hear other people's conversations; you will worry that you take up too much space simply by sitting down. But if you're comfortable trading a little razzle-dazzle for some truly exceptional food (especially for this price range), prepare your palate for the symphony of flavours offered at Thai Kitchen.  Celiac disease robbed me of the ability to properly handle gluten, so asian restaurants are a special part of the landmine that is dining-out. But Thai Kitchen? Totally groovy with that. The staff are well-acquainted with what gluten is and where it's found, and will steer you clear of potential hazards. Even better, the GF options are something other than salad, rice, and rice salad. I feel like a real person, and not a public nuisance, when I ask for GF fare, and that makes all the difference.  Though I'm a woman of simple tastes (I am regularly hassled for ordering Pad Thai every single time, but it caresses my taste buds with such exquisite delicacy!) I have tried a great many dishes offered here: there's a yellow curry that tastes like the sun dancing across the side of a building on a warm summer evening as the scent of wildflowers hangs in the breeze; the basil fried rice kicks the tongue as it goes down,  delicious even the more for its heady spices.  I've only been disappointed twice: a cashew, chicken, and rice dish that was essentially those ingredients sitting brown and unadorned on plain china, and one memorable event where I chose to put spice on an already spicy dish (it overwhelms the flavours, rather than enhance. Poor choice.)  Spice, of all things, is what Thai Kitchen does best, and when used carefully and in consideration of existing spice in the dish, can make a meal tremendous. The spice scale is 1-10, 10 being \"Thai hot.\" What they don't tell you (but you soon learn) is that the number is directly correlated with the number of thai peppers sliced and added to your meal.  Patrons have been known to go higher than 10; I myself briefly held the record for 41 peppers in the (delicious at any level) Thai Kitchen Tom Yum soup. It took an entire pot to fit the arsenal of peppers, but it was an experience both invigorating and terrifying--though the latter only because I didn't think I could fit a gallon of soup in my body. (The fallout, such as it were, was not as drastic as one may have thought.)  Absolutely recommended to anyone looking for a new place to try in the Lakewood area, or for that matter anywhere in greater CLE."}
{"text":"The best Thai I've ever had and the owner loves to talk to you!!! Made feel totally at home!! Ask her about the Thai chillies that she grows!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre flavors of basic american thai. I love spicy foods, always get thai hot in thai restaurants but thai hot here is just SUPER HEAT with NO other flavor. Ordered the tofu rad nar last night and I couldnt tell if I was eating a piece of tofu or a piece of broccoli. Was very disappointed....  Husband got the garlic eggplant with veggies in a medium and that was very delicious....next time probably stick with with a hot or a medium.  Child was happy with his pad thai !! Thats his go to meal at every thai restaurant.  Also ordered the veggie rolls and tofu spring rolls....both were fresh and satisfying !!   Also had there panang curry last time but honestly dont remember it.... :(  Not authentic enough, therefore the 3 stars.  Nice staff though and clean establishment with vegetarian oprions is a big plus."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place to eat or order take out.  This hole in a wall joint is perfect for a quiet dinner for two or a movie night at home with the family.  After eating at various Thai restaurants in the Cleveland area, this one is by far my favorite.  It does not need a fancy, expensive setting or delicate silverware to overcompensate for the fact that the food is simply authentic.  Kwan was born and raised in Thailand and has been back since moving to America to further expand her knowledge on the cuisine- and it shows.    The portions are perfect and everything is deliciously cooked to perfection.   The spring rolls with their light crispy flavor and sweet sauce are a must have.  You cannot go wrong with the Pad Thai although my favorite by far is the shrimp pad see ew.  Be careful with the spicy scale... A 3 on a scale of 10 may seem weak but that is the max that I can handle!  If you like spicy food, this restaurant will give your taste buds a run for their money.  I highly recommend this joint and refuse to get my Thai fix anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have had.  Love the Thai Kitchen Tom Yum soup and the red curry.  The curry can be really spicy, but the pad Thai is usually more mild and a great dish.  Very small place, but I hope she expands as more people find this great spot."}
{"text":"The food is a 5 but the owner is a 1! It's unfortunate. We would love to eat here all of the time but we've never had a good experience."}
{"text":"The service is good, restaurant is clean and fresh. However, food is not even close to authentic Thai and it is more pricey comparing with other Thai restaurants surrounding.  If you look for a more authentic taste, then I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times. This place tends to be spicier (and maybe more authentic) than your average Thai place. I believe the owner is married to a Thai woman and is pretty into Thai culture - and I really felt like he knew his stuff. The inside is small and cute. Many of the decorations inside had things I saw for sale at markets in Thailand. For me, that adds a star for authenticity to the dining atmosphere.   However, food-wise nothing really stood out to me besides that it's spicier than most. There's a 1 to 10 scale which gives you a higher degree of customization to your spice level - but scales are all relative to a person so it can be hit or miss depending on your personal taste and perception. Also, I have ordered the same spice level on occasion and there was a dramatic difference in what came out of the kitchen each time. Not a huge fan of the gamble.  Their menu is pretty extensive. The Pad Thai is tasty and pretty unique (in a good way).   Lastly, they do not accept American Express. Minus a star for me."}
{"text":"My friend from work referred me and I absolutely love it. Definitely a family favorite. Love the location, finally something in the East Valley! The food is delicious and the staff is awesome. Highly recommend. I have to have it at least 1X a week... so great"}
{"text":"Thai kitchen has improved with the new ownership than it was 5 some years ago when i started eating here. Now I come here on a weekly basis to get my Thai fixings. The taste has improved 110% from the old owners, (the old owners, an older married couple are related to the new owners as well. they are cousins).  The menu has new additions, and my favorite is H2, the bangkok lo-mein, followed by KS5 the basil fried rice, and KS2 green with duck, amazing can't go wrong !! No MSG, they can make meals according to your spice capabilities, they have brown rice as well (and it's really good, never had anything like it before), and spring rolls freshly made on a daily basis. This women works hard to make her food taste good, and it shows. I like that the servers (two who switch off with each other) don't come annoying you every 5 minutes as they do in other chain restaurants. When they see you're running low on water they fill it propmply, and still follow up just enough times that you have an enjoyable meal. And i still wonder how they have time to do their homework in the back corner sometimes, their both serious about school. The food is great, the atmosphere is great. It almost feel as if you're in Thailand by with all the decorations and pictures on the wall.  I recommend to all the people who said it's not good, go back and try again, because i have yet to be disappointing, and whenever i am dining in other customers say the same as me.   A great hole in the wall joint."}
{"text":"I've picked up dinner from here a few times. Their coconut noodle soup is good and their fried rice was good. I've tried a few other things here and they've been good.   But that one time I feel their crunchy spring roll were bad, a bad taste and seemed stale. I've had it in the past and it was never so bad. Hope they fix it and it consistent all the time."}
{"text":"I would venture to say that this is the best Thai food in Cleveland if you are looking for authentic flavors, spice level, and a restaurant that considers dietary restrictions. Almost all options can be made vegan and gluten free which is a huge bonus. Thai iced coffee that is to die for. Highly recommend any of the curry dishes!"}
{"text":"Heard this place opened so we were eager to check it out.  We went on a Saturday night around 7 and almost didn't go in because there was only one table with diners. Boy am I glad we gave it a chance. Really delicious food (I had the spicy basil with chicken and my husband the massaman curry, we shared egg rolls to start).  The service was great, food fresh and music and atmosphere very welcoming and relaxing.  I wanted to try the sticky rice with mango but she checked the mango and apologized they weren't quite ripe enough. While I was ready to end the meal with a sweet treat, I appreciated even more they opted not to serve me something that wouldn't have met their high standards.  I recommended this as a great Thai place in the far east valley.  I understand they just opened so won't be surprised to expect to wait for a table next time as I'm certain the word will spread quickly!"}
{"text":"Finally! A good Thai food restaurant in the area. Thai kitchen has great Thai food that is on par with any other Thai restaurant that I've ate at."}
{"text":"I've been going to Thai Kitchen sporadically (perhaps 4 times) over the last 15 years. Every time I go I thoroughly enjoy the cozy ambiance and the fine, fresh cooked food. The place seats only 13 people and you can bring your own beer which goes very well with the food. The heat scale is 1 to 10 and I find that 7 is about as hot as I can tolerate (and it's ridiculously hot for most people).   Beware, this place is not for those in a hurry. Every dish seems to be cooked to order in the small kitchen. Hence, a dinner can last between 60 and 120 minutes for 2 to 4 people. If you're going to go to Thai Kitchen, go there with people that you enjoy being around for that amount of time. Relax, have a drink (which you've brought!), and enjoy some of the finest Thai food in Cleveland.  TZ"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received. Took 20 minute just to play my drink order. One waitress who was running the take out counter and doing the tables.  I noticed several people come in and place take out orders and receive them before I was even able to place my order!!  Took almost 3 hours for my visit total and the lady only checked on me once after I got my food.  Ordered mild pad Thai and it was def not mild.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Won't go back.  Not very good.  Boiled beef not stir fried -- gross. Small portion for the money. Expected tip for carryout."}
{"text":"I think This is the most authentic thai food in cleveland. The menu is a bit different and they have some menu which other thai restaurants here don't have , my favorite are hung-lay curry, papaya salad served in mortar. Pork with basil (real thai basil)  and larb and sticky rice. And for dessert ; mango with sticky rice is a must!"}
{"text":"I stop here every time I am in town.  The owners run the place, and are extremely friendly.  They make their curry paste from scratch, and it shows.  Their attention to detail and passion for great food is beyond compare.  They are very conscious of vegan options, often reminding me to request \"no eggs\" in their tofu pad thai.  The dining area is small but comfortable.  I have ordered take out and dined in for lunch and dinner.  Every experience has exceeded my expectations.  Be careful where you park though.  If you park in the neighbors lot it could ruin an otherwise perfect meal."}
{"text":"I ordered a pad kee mao (level 2 spicy which is mild). The amount of hot peppers that was in the entree was overwhelming. It was more like level 8 or 9. I was able to eat less than half and had to stop.   I let them know that there was a mistake and the entree was overly spicy and they were instantly defensive saying that's how they make it. I've been to Thai Kitchen many times for the past few years so I know what mild is supposed to be. I was rather shocked at their reaction.   We paid the complete check and will never return."}
{"text":"Great. Tastes just like in Thailand, comes with the seasoning carousel most places don't"}
{"text":"I love this place! I finally tried other items besides the Pad Thai and am very happy. I would have never know what to order if the staff didn't help me. I'm glad I asked."}
{"text":"We spotted this place while heading over to another restaurant and figured we'd give it a try. The night started off a bit rocky with the waiting staff and continued to get worse as the night progressed. We were there for 45 minutes before we received our potstickers, they were okay, I get the same tasting potstickers from the boxes I buy at costco. 15 minutes later one of the entrees came out, the garlic chicken was only warm and it was dry, like it had been sitting under a warmer for some time, the flavor was pretty good though. 10 minutes later the rest of the clan received their food. My daughters sweet and sour shrimp had a great sauce but the shrimp batter was soggy and undercooked. The last dish was shrimp curry with medium spice, the shrimp was rubbery but once again the flavor was good. The best part of the night was the thai tea. That was good. It was a long night waiting for food that wasn't fantastic but only okay, Im sure we will give it another shot sometime, just not anytime soon. They have a few bugs to work out yet, and even then we will most likely get take out."}
{"text":"Service was kind and courteous I would encourage a to go order and eat at Edgewater park. Although the combination pad thai didn't have all the promised ingredients."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in the Cleveland area... Probably the most \"authentic\"... as much as I could possibly know what that means, having never been to Thailand.  I like the curries and crispy spring rolls the best.  There are some dishes I haven't seen on the menus of other Thai restaurants.  The owner/ chef automatically makes vegetarian/ tofu dishes vegan (unless they come with egg... ask for no egg to make it vegan).  It is somewhat inconsistent at times, but I hardly know of a place that isn't.  I am more often very pleased with what I get.  It seems like they have  been making portions smaller for take out... Maybe the new containers?  That's okay, I still like it the best.  If you like things super-spicy, they will make things 30/10 spice level.  I usually get take-out.  The restaurant can be crowded and the kitchen is right there... in way I like this, but I don't really like the smell of meat cooking.  This probably doesn't bother most people.  Overall, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great early dinner with my wife.  Curry was excellent and the new coconut sorbet was just right as a dessert.  Not too sweet and not over powering. Staff are friendly and helpful.  Food is great,  atmosphere is awesome and price is affordable.  2nd time here and will be going back until I have tasted everything the authentic Thai chef and owner have to offer"}
{"text":"This place is very small- just a few tables. As other have said no parking and they do not take credit cards.  The food was just so so. We had service issues (service is slow). The place could be a lot cleaner. Just below average in all regards ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in town. It is very small as others have said, but I find it cozy. The walls are covered in pictures and knickknacks from the family's vacations to Thailand. Some of their dishes are even served in some of the family's souvenirs!   The food is also really good. I can taste the difference in the quality of the spices used here pretty easily. Nothing in town really compares. I will warn you to be cautious about heat level if you don't like hot food. The owner and his wife will be happy to accommodate you. That being said, the food is really a lot better if you get it hot!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything we've gotten has been excellent, the pad thai is delicious. Very small place, great for a date night."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat at the \"Thai Kitchen\" last night as it was their first day open and they are rather close to the house. The wife and I walked over about six o'clock.  The dining area is very clean with a comfortable atmosphere and had some nice jazz playing. Tables aren't crowded and there were a few other people already eating or waiting for a take home order.    I really liked the spacious feel of the place, the kitchen is set back from the dining area but open to it so you can see the food being prepared. Everything was spotlessly clean and everyone was smiling and friendly! It was easy to hold a quiet conversation at the table.  I ordered a Garlic and Thai Eggplant dish that was absolutely delicious, presented beautifully and generously portioned. Not a fan of very spicy/hot food so I asked for it mild and that was exactly what I got.  My wife ordered a Rice and Beef entree on the medium spicy side and again the food was delicious, beautifully plated and seasoned perfectly.  Service was phenomenal - attentive without being annoying and our drinks never got less then halfway full. Thanks Sara!  I really feel this intersection needed a place to eat that wasn't a large chain or too \"fast foody\" and Thai Kitchen really fits the bill. Four stars for now as I have only eaten here once so far but hope to upgrade to five after a few more experiences.  If you live in the area please support this new business and stop by for a bite to eat, the bill was less then $30.00 including a 20% tip that was definitely deserved."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent! The restaurant itself is very clean. The staff I've met is very friendly. Food is excellent and well priced. Our favorites are the phad Thai, phad see ew & green+yellow curries. The mango sticky rice is also great. Can't wait to try more and will be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here on Monday for the first time. My husband recommended it knowing I love to try new restaurants. We came in for lunch and had a wonderful experience. Our server was very helpful explaining all the different dishes. We had an appetizer, and since I couldn't decide...we shared 3 entrees. Everything was wonderful. The curry (level 2) was not too spicy. I will definitely be heading back the next time I get a Thai food craving!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The curry made my mouth soooo happy with all the distinct flavors. The service was super friendly and fast. The restaurant is very small (only a few tables for four and a few for two) but clean.  We had the yellow curry, massaman curry, pad Thai, fresh spring rolls, and crispy spring rolls. We had a combination of the meats and the spice levels. Everything came out perfectly. We would absolutely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I drive over an hour to go here. That should say in of itself how good their food is!! Pad Thai and Coconut Curry Soup is my favorite."}
{"text":"food: 5/5 service: 3/5 for the long wait, 5/5 for how nice they were  Delicious Thai food! I have eaten at a couple of the Thai places in town and this by far has the best food, and it isn't expensive either. 6 of us showed up and we unfortunately had to wait 45 minutes for our food, but the wait was worth it. The spiciness levels they offer (1-10) are legit; I have a pretty low tolerance and was sweating at 4/10. I sampled the Thai Todmun (fish cakes, tasty), the Yum Woonsen (very good) and the Seafood Hot Plate, which was delicious. The staff were friendly and tried to accommodate us, but it wasn't possible due to the TINY size off the place. I will definitely be back and eat here to experience Thai Kitchen fully."}
{"text":"We were very happy to see a Thai restaurant added to our neighborhood.  The food was amazing  and the server was very knowledgable about the menu and our questions. I had the Massaman Curry while my wife and son tried the Pad See Ew. Unlike other area Thai establishments, this one actually adds some heat when you ask for Thai hot. We will be going again."}
{"text":"Really good tasting food. Small establishment but can order to go. Like the Thai fried rice, Tom Yum Soup and potstickers. Would highly recommend this place. Closes for a bit during the day in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Have eaten there at least 6 times never been disappointed, my favorite is the garlic eggplant the basil is so fresh and fragrant! Also the spring rolls are amazing fresh as well. My wife likes some dish? with crystal noodles. Only thing I don't care for there is the chairs, for me very hard and uncomfortable. But other then that I'll continue to eat there....."}
{"text":"Amazing! Do not let the appearance and location throw you off! This is by far the best Thai food I have found in Northeast Ohio. The chef has been making amazing dishes for over 30 years. A must try for Thai food enthusiasts."}
{"text":"Best place in Cleveland to get Thai food. It seriously doesn't get any better than this! Ignore the super small interiors; obviously, the service and the food here are what matters. It's a great family run hole-in-the-wall joint, and they pride themselves on serving authentic food.  My favorite item on their menu is #43- kuit tiao. It's a Thai noodle soup and every Thai establishment alters the dish in a different way. The secret is to ask Kwan to add peanuts to the dish. The portions are huge for the great price you're paying.  Be warned: if you ask for a 10 on the spice scale, it will be spicy! :)  If I visit Cleveland again, I will definitely stop by this joint."}
{"text":"Fabulous Thai food, and great service.  A variety of Thai dishes and teas.  Staff was attentive and very knowledgeable about vegan options."}
{"text":"Best Thai on west side.  Nice variety of options, with excellent Pad woon sen, a personal fave."}
{"text":"This was an amazing Thai Spot...mild is pretty much no spice so go for the medium spice level"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best part of my experience was the service, the people who own this place are awesome!   I had the Chicken Pad Thai at a level 3 (yep, I'm weak) and it was awesome! The Thai Coconut Curry soup there is amazingly delicious!   *Portion sizes are great! *Prices are fair for quantity and quality  *Staff is awesome *Family owned and operated  *Authentic  *Overall great atmosphere  We will definitely be going back to this pace time and again!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to see a Thai Restaurant open up in the far east part of Mesa as I live in Gold Canyon.  My husband and I went for lunch and ordered green curry and pad thai.  The soup that was served with it had a lot of different flavors going on which is what I love about Thai food.  Problem is, it was served lukewarm and there were various hard chewy things like ginger that I had to keep pulling out of my mouth.  The curry was quite good and vegetables were very fresh and it was served with a good portion of rice.  Then there was the Pad Thai.  I've NEVER had pad thai that was so completely devoid of flavor.  Since I order this dish my first time at every Thai restaurant I go to, I have a lot to compare to and I can honestly say it was the worst pad thai I've ever eaten.  I will try this restaurant again since they are so new but my initial reaction is disappointment."}
{"text":"A great little Thai restaurant find to the east.  I find it refreshing when restaurants have a focus, knowing specifically what they are about.  This little gem is that.  The menu isn't multi-pages of combos, but a discrete set of appetizers, soups, salads, curry, proteins and noodles.  The decor is clean, simple, and neat.  I thoroughly enjoyed the vegetarian spring rolls, the Panaeng curry, and a Thai iced tea.  The Panaeng stood out as being very flavorful and well balanced, with medium spice providing a nice complimentary heat to the red curry in the dish.  Delicious.   I will certainly be returning soon!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and we were not dissapointed. Started with the pot stickers and for entrees had the Sweet and Sour Pork the Green Curry Beef and the Cashew chicken. All of them a little different but all very tasty. Very friendly service and food came out quickly. Nice small family restaurant atmosphere. We can't wait to go back and try a different dish."}
{"text":"I'm sad about the rice.   Thai Kitchen started out more like a three-star: tom kha gai that had actual lemongrass, galangal and Kaffir lime leaves still in it. That's hard to find; many a restaurant worker has told us that too many folks complain about it.  The soup had too much coconut milk, and it was that sort of canned coconut milk that has sodium benzoate or some other preservative mixed in. Hey, I've used it in a pinch. But I've never so clearly tasted it before at a restaurant.   But the rice was simply awful. Minute rice? Something like that. It wasn't jasmine, basmati or even grocery-store medium-grain. It was nasty. I didn't like the green curry (because of the coconut milk again), but the chili-basil dish was pretty good, especially with the prik nam pla that kept arriving to spice it up. But, in all honesty, nothing can cover up for bad rice."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! Be sure to try the Thai Kitchen Tom Yum soup."}
{"text":"So delicious! I recommend the Thai kitchen Tom yum soup. It's the perfect combination of spicy, citrus, and sweet. I crave it from the moment I finish the bowl. The service is always friendly and the food is made fresh."}
{"text":"I give it an A+!  I ordered sweet - sour chicken.  Egg rolls as an appetizer. Large portion of the sweet & sour chicken. Very reasonable prices. Service was great. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Very fresh and not expensive at all. The staff is very friendly and explains the food to you should you have any questions. Very good will def eat there again!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my wife and daughter. It was delicious. We were quite hungry and ordered lots of food for the three of us to share. Spring rolls, fresh rolls, chicken satay, papaya salad, stir-fried red curry with peppercorn, bell pepper, onion, green bean, basil, seasoned veggies, and chicken (H 4), and Beef Ta-Krite, a stir-fried beef with lemon grass, chili paste and string bean (H 6). Everything was SO good, but the spring rolls (and yummy sauce) and H 4 stole the show. Highly recommended! It is a tiny, family-run restaurant run by super nice people. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lets see  what can i say about this place.. First of all i'm in the restaurant business 19 years to date and maybe thats y i care so much... Went to thai kitchen tonight to have a lovely dinner with my wife on our day off. we love thai food and we have experienced thai places worldwide and of course they cant b the same quality so i'm not here to advertise better places in the area. Appetizers were good but when it came time for my favorite shrimp pad thai, it was way different from the one that actually thai kitchen served us since the last time(before their renovation), and that\"s ok. At the end we decided to order desert and i assume the owner(dark shirt mid 50s) took our order for desert which was custard. 3 mins later he brings us the check before we got desert but that.s fine. Desert comes and we tried it and honestly it had zero taste. My wife stood up and went to the kitchen window(since we had the check before desert) and asked if we can switch desert, and the owner told her that that's the way the chef want the custard to taste and also that we were going to be charged anyways (4,99 $). So my wife said that's fine bc for us in order to get another desert , meant to pay the first and the second one. So we said never mind and decided to pay.Then a very polite member of the staff came and explained that recipes are diffrent from region to region and did comp the desert, but the dammage is done. Now.. i work in a bistro and saturday a lady was unhappy with her dish so i had to comp it( 24$ with my manager approval)and she picked something else..that is the risky part of the business...not always dishes are meant to b liked...but the crazy part is that this place charges anything and expecting that the customers leave happy and come back... not happening tonight thai kitchen!!! p.s: dear owner come and get served by me and see what means to make ur night great with food made with passion and served to u with a smile!!!"}
{"text":"A tiny, hole-in-the-wall place on Madison that doesn't accept credit cards and has a maximum occupancy of about 10 people. I'm not terribly familiar with authentic Thai cuisine, but of the various restaurants around Cleveland, Thai Kitchen had by far the most distinctive dishes and flavors. Whereas most places have a standard offering of flavors (you could go to any restaurant, anywhere, and have a similar dish), Thai Kitchen's menu has greater depth of flavor than the competition. The seasonings are  my favorite of Cleveland's Thai restaurants, and the food comes on a scale of zero to 'Thai' (10). I had mine prepared as a 5 and it had plenty of kick!  The only downsides are the limited seating (as I said, fewer than a dozen seats) and the longer time required to make dishes from a smaller kitchen (45 minute wait for a group of 6). Overall, definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"It was good but just not great. I have had excellent Thai food and this stacks ups with the good ones. Wish I could give 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Best Thai so far in the Cleveland area! My favorite is the keang panang. Have had the pad thai which was fine but not as good as the panang. And this is the place where you can get actual Thai spicy and not marginal 'American' spicy at other places. And the prices are so CHEAP! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is authentic as it gets! The menu is a little overwhelming and if you like spicy this is your place! I love the ginger tea and The Thai Kitchen Tom Yum!!! I usually try a different specialty dish every time in go. Service can be a little to laid back, but the family there is so pleasant."}
{"text":"Probably best Thai food in Cleveland. But you have to know that it's probably the size if your kitchen. Literally."}
{"text":"OK....so this place might not have the \"perfect\" authentic Thai food but it's really, really good.  GOOD STUFF:  Really good Thai food at cheap prices.  BYOB (awsome).  Super nice couple that owns and operates this small restaurant.  The husband is the waiter and the wife does the cooking.  You feel like you're in their kitchen given the very small size of the whole place (may be six tables or so)  BAD STUFF:  If you're looking for fancy, this place is not your place.  Kind of hole in the wallish but clean.  PRICE:  Cheap.  About 25$ for two people.  OVERALL:  Really great place if you like cheap Thai food.  Definitely worth a try.  Careful about asking for stuff really spicy cause it can come out on fire.....!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Food was nasty. Looked and taste like left-overs, very dry, and old tasting."}
{"text":"This place is great.  We have since moved from the Cleveland area, but still yearn for their delicious meals.  The spring rolls and dipping sauce are excellent as are the Pad Thai and any of the curries we've tried.  Highly recommended.  We don't know of a better Thai place around.  As others have mentioned, don't expect to eat in a nice restaurant, or even to eat in the restaurant as they only have a handful of tables (when in doubt, takeout).  The quality of the food more than makes up for any of these deficiencies."}
{"text":"Good Thai food!  Not great, but quite good.  Sampled the fried rice, the dessert sticky rice, and the Thai iced tea.  All good!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Extremely good. Love the Pad Thai, Yellow Curry and the Thai Tea is the best ever! Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Thai Kitchen is something I miss so much after moving away from Cleveland. It's a gem with delicious food and friendly service!   A few points:   - I recommend the Shrimp in a Clay Pot. I still fantasize about it 500 miles away, and I can't find it anywhere else.   - Also, order a pot of ginger tea (if you're into that kind of thing) or any of their curries, and/or essentially anything and everything on the menu.  - You will order your food on a spiciness scale of 1-10, 10 being \"Thai Hot,\" and they do not mess around. If you like spicy, you've come to the right place :) But if you don't, there's something for you too.   - It's BYOB: Do it.   - Thai Kitchen is not a fancy place, it's a cozy one with few tables. It's great for takeout, but I wouldn't bring a group. Just for a 1-on-1, the little table by the window is my favorite!  Yum."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for a casual date night based on the reviews by fellow yelpers. I don't know what traditional Thai food is like but I do know what good Thai food tastes like and this place hit the mark.   This place is extremely affordable. We ordered the spring rolls, a small soup and 2 entrees and our bill was $30! The Tom Kar soup was very flavorful and really hit the spot even on a hot summer day. The spice level was perfect. I ordered the Pad Se Ew with combination meat with a level 3 spice and ate all of it! I could probably eat that dish everyday! The spice level was perfect for me and the soy sauce was perfect and not too salty. My boyfriend ordered the Pad Woon-Sen and while he enjoyed it he had wished there was a little bit more flavor like my dish had. Overall our food was delicious and we will be back!  *Quick shout out to the yelpers who wrote about the spice levels being hotter than most places, I think you saved us from ordering something we wouldn't have been able to eat!"}
{"text":"Going into Thai Kitchen was like walking into a nice cafe. The decorations were modern, and it was clean. My family came in and ordered the green curry and ginger lover lunch specials. The special's first came with a small bowl of soup, an appropriate size for an appetizer. It was tom kha soup and had a delicious broth as well as tofu with a generous portion of vegetables. The green curry was a little bit different, for one thing it looked like it had a small portion of sour cream on top, but it was nevertheless very good. It came with a generous portion of rice and the vegetables were tender! Something which can be pretty rare in some restaraunts. The ginger lover was good because it did not have a ginger sauce but instead had strips of ginger in it. The specials were a bit pricey, but we will likely come back because of the great service and good food."}
{"text":"THai Kitchen Tom YUM!(w/ tofu) literally the best soup I have ever consumed in my 26 years on this soup filled planet I call home. The currys and pad thais I've had are also delicious."}
{"text":"It was a worst service we have ever had in restaurants We ordered Garlic eggplant, Pad thai and Panang Curry,  but Pad Thai was so salty that  we could not eat. The waitress just walked away after hearing our complain and never came back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. It is a shame to say this place discriminates against black minorities. I ordered and paid for food and was forced to leave the restaurant because they needed to \"make room for customers \" it is very unprofessional to ask a paying customer to leave for other customers who are also paying. I see no difference and why I was asked to leave. Also this food is very process and high in sodium. I refuse to patronize a facility that conducts this sort of business. Also when I spoke to the woman who is the manager there she offered no reconciliation. Not a place of business I would recommend. You're better off cooking at home."}
{"text":"Placed order for pickup they said 25 minutes, 45 minutes still not ready. I give this place another few months to live for the bad service when they were not that busy"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and it was great. It's a cozy little place, great for a date or small group of people. I got the Thai Kitchen Tom Yum and it was so good. I'm super excited that they do takeout, I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall, but clean. You can eat in if you want without a complaint. However, I have only ever done take-out because I think half of eating out is the atmosphere and this place is too small for me to find it worth dining in. I suppose that is up to one's personal opinion.   The food is good and not expensive. If you are looking to try a Lakewood Thai place for the first time, Thai Kitchen is your best bet.   I don't believe they accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch menu at a fair price. I ordered red curry Thai hot which was spicy but not so much you can't taste anything else. I got tofu with my curry which was very firm and delicious. The mango sticky rice is wonderful and not overly sweet. Small restaurant with good food and service."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great food, great food and good service too.  Recommend this place to be added on your list.  The Pad Se ew is great.  The Curries are bomb."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been hoping for a good Thai place near us for a while now. We heard about Thai Kitchen through a friend and are SO glad we gave it a try! The food is OUTSTANDING and some of the best Thai food I've ever had. We enjoyed the yellow curry with shrimp and chicken, egg rolls, and Tom Yum soup. Excellent!"}
{"text":"As always, excellent food and service. Spice level 5 is perfect for me. Chose #23 on the menu this time with chicken and of course had to order spring rolls.  Yummy."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was great. We are traveling to Thailand in March and not that knowledgeable about Thai food. We asked the owners advice for a selection of three different common dishes we could expect in Thailand. We had a curry dish, a noodle dish and a rice dish. Some with chicken and some with shrimp. All were great with plenty left over for the next days lunch."}
{"text":"I was excited about this place, reading about their willingness to make meals vegan and their unique authenticity in a sea full of Thai restaurants. I tried the pad thai and was delighted by the mound of food and the overall presentation. It looked phenomenal, but that's about it. It was probably the most lackluster dish I've had under the label of \"pad thai\". There simply wasn't much flavor. I powered through my main dish but really enjoyed what my boyfriend ordered, the coconut curry soup. Now THAT was beyond delicious! The layered flavors from the coconut milk and curry were complemented by the added spice. That small taste of soup changed the trajectory of my meal. Then, wrapping up with dessert, the mango with sticky rice was amazing! Simplicity wins with this dessert. It wasn't overly sweet and made me feel virtuous, you know, fruit (with rice) for dessert isn't so bad...Right?!"}
{"text":"I went here to try my standard - vegetarian pad thai. As other reviewers say, it's a teeny tiny dining space - but the staff are personable, friendly, and they make it work.  Pad thai is never spicy enough for me. Ever. So I walked in and asked for a 12 out of 10 on their spicy scale (which does warn you that if you cry, you asked for it). They thought I was kidding, but I ensured them I wanted it that hot.  So we made a deal:  if they could make me cry with their spice level, I would come back in and re-order another dish the following day.   I got some fantastically hot pad thai (with a :-P drawn on the take-out box) BUT it still had a fantastic flavor! The tofu was good - but there were no veggies, which was a little saddening.  I will definitely go back - the food was good, they give you exactly like you ask, and they are such a friendly, family-run business that I would go and support that alone.  And for the record, I didn't cry.  Bring it on, 12 out of 10!"}
{"text":"The food was OK. It just wasn't what I was expecting. I got  the green curry and the only real flavor was the spice, not the sweet coconut you expect. I also thought the portion size was quite small. I ordered to go. Charm  Thai in Parma was waaayyy better."}
{"text":"The single complaint I ever would have considered allowing the merest possibility of crossing my mind about Thai Kitchen was that they didn't take credit cards. Because the food is so good, it was a minor inconvenience to stop for cash, but this is now a thing of the past. We were there last night and they NOW ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS.  I tried the Tom Kar soup last night and it was delicious, I may make it a permanent feature of my visits. It was spicy and delicious, perfect for a cold night."}
{"text":"Oh my, where should I start?  I was extremely ecstatic when I saw a Thai restaurant opened up in East Mesa and even more excited when they serve extremely delicious food.  I've eaten here plenty of times and each time was suburb!!! One night our party of 10 came in for my sister's birthday dinner after we were told the wait for another restaurant was at least an hour, and Thai kitchen staff gave us no fuss at all. They rearrange to accommodate our large party and serve us with smiling faces. After I checked in on Yelp, I realize they close in half an hour which made me appreciate them even more.   My favorite is the chicken pad thai (medium spice) and beef green curry (medium spice). I eat pretty spicy and I felt like medium was perfect for me.   Pros: + prices are VERY reasonable, especially for lunch + wait staff is always friendly and accommodating  + decor is cute with elephant pillows at the booths + mango sticky rice, need I say more?   Cons: - they close between lunch and dinner   I definitely would come back, only place I want my Thai food."}
{"text":"For the number of Thai places in Cleveland area this place is not bad and relatively authentic.  The food is good enough to attract and please the local crowd as well as leave the Thai curry fiends with the necessary fix.    I personally wasn't a fan of their spring rolls, tasted generic and not really Thai style.  Also for those who can handle the heat, their spice level is not what you'd think.  The 10 and 1 both didn't burn or make u sweat but they have dry peppers and chili oil you can add. Just no fresh peppers.  I'd give this place a 3.5 for what it is and a 4 for being in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Tried their spicy fried rice, it was really good."}
{"text":"This is a great local option for takeout Thai food. The Panaeng curry chicken had some atypical veggies thrown in, but it was good. The pad Thai is decent. Everything we've ordered has been well flavored and tasty  I would give five stars, but the takeout portions are a little small for the cost."}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite dishes are the green Thai curry and the papaya salad. Their flavors remind me of Thailand quality! They have stayed true to their cuisine."}
{"text":"Excellent food and always fabulous service! Everything we've eaten has been tasty and satisfying. The portions are generous and eating the lunch menu is great bang for your buck! We've eaten here 6 times and have always left full and happy!"}
{"text":"My sister recommended this restaurant. She's pregnant and has an odd craving for Thai fried rice. You know you can't argue with a pregnant woman on what you're going to pick up for lunch.    The atmosphere: it has a farmhouse theme to it. It's really cute but feels oddly decorated. It's clean though so I shouldn't complain.  The food: my sister enjoyed her beef fried rice. My pad siew was unfortunately salty. The Thai ice tea I had was lacking flavor and watered down even the first sip. It took me so long to finish my lunch portion the waiter asked if I needed a box.   The price: a little under $30 for 2 lunch specials which comes with a mini veggie eggroll, a small portion of entree added 2 drinks and a side of rice. I left unsatisfied but I'm willing to try something different in the future and maybe a dinner plate will fit the craving.   The staff: our waiter was pleasant and attentive which I greatly appreciate."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is delicious! The order is always correct & the staff is always very friendly. Our office always orders the crystal noodles, yellow curry and the mussaman curry is the best! We highly recommend this place for anyone that loves Thai food!"}
{"text":"Great food - tiny space! Got take out from here which was very good and I'm glad I did, this place is really tiny. They have about 8 tables in a very narrow space about half of which is divided off as the kitchen. When I called they said it would be about 40 min. It was a Friday night and when I got there I could see why. The kitchen can't be very big either, in its half of the room. Main thing is food is very tasty. It was ready when I got there, based on what I was told. Everything was nicely packaged up and warm and fresh when I got back to my place. Very fresh ingredients. The heat is to your order and very vegetarian friendly. Great find thanks to yelp."}
{"text":"Family Owned!! Very clean and overall a nice place with great healthy choices. Everyone local was happy when this place opened because it was something different in the East Valley and my household has been extremely happy with the food and selections. Some things have changed since they first opened like the portions have gotten smaller but you expect things like that with a new business. Not so new anymore but they seem to have gotten things down pretty well now and they've always been quick, courteous and accurate with our take-out orders. Our favs the Pad See Ew and Green Chicken Curry omg special  ~Support Family Business~  \"Phat si-io also transliterated as pad see ew, pad siew, or pad siu, Thai: , or is a Chinese-influenced stir fried noodle dish that is commonly eaten in Thailand. Wikipedia\""}
{"text":"This is a hidden treasure that I hope for my sake stays hidden. Upon appearance we didn't want to eat there, could use some updating/cleaning. However, the aroma kept us there. The Pad Thai is some of the best I ever had, next to the Veggie Curry. On hot days we ride out bike here just to pick up an Iced Thai Tea...so good! It's family owned and literally just the family works there. Mom/wife is the brilliant chef, husband and daughter are the front of the house. This place makes magic."}
{"text":"I'm going back and forth between offering 3 or  4 stars. The food was good, and absolutely took care of my craving for Thai, but it wasn't \"knock your socks off good\", so I definitely can't give5 stars. It was really quite the standard menu, so I don't know if I can say it is truly better than average ( which would be 4 stars to me.) So I guess it's 3 stars, though the friendly service and the cleanliness of the restaurant make me feel like 3 is a little low. Ultimately I enjoyed my pad se-iew ( wide noodles in sweet black soy with broccoli and chicken) and my Thai tea and am certain I will be back. I guess it boils down to decent food closer to home than other spots we enjoy. Convenience counts for something, right?"}
{"text":"It's rare to see good asian restaurants in the valley that hone in on the fundamentals of asian cooking. Specifically with thai, you must work with fresh ingredients, hence my preference to them. I ordered the mango sticky rice and massuman curry.  Mango sticky rice came out with a fresh mango. You could taste it. The rice? Cooked to just the point past an Italian \"al dente\" but with the light sweetness to be expected that pairs perfectly well with the mango.  The massuman curry came in a large size. THIS demands a highlight. Most thai places in the valley cheap out on the quantity of curry provided. Curry is relatively cheap to make. Is it as cheap as ramen? No, but it's not a filet mignon either. So I was pleasantly surprised when my order of massuman curry weighed nearly a pound. (We did take out and I placed the curry on a scale and it was pretty close there).   The massuman curry had plenty of meat in it, and had the right infusion of spice and coconut milk. Very meaty curry, which is what massuman should be like.  Also, the side of rice is required and should not cost extra. And it didn't."}
{"text":"The absolute best Thai food in Cleveland. Growing up in a Thai household and living in Thailand in 2012.... Chef Kwan brings authenticity to a new level. Try the som tan and gai yang (chicken) for a staple Thai dish. All the dishes taste like they come from the famous street vendors in Thailand. Enjoy the pictures hanging on the wall for a true feel of Thailand. The service is great and I always look forward to a great conversation! Arroi Mak!"}
{"text":"Great little place in east Mesa with a great price!  Everyone here is extremely friendly and they make you feel right at home the minute you walk in! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's in the mood for good Thai food!"}
{"text":"If you like atmosphere in a restaurant, then you're out of luck. This is like dining in someone's living room.  It's small (I think there are five tables total), you can hear the clatter of the kitchen, and one time an errant air conditioner dripped down my back the whole time.  On more than one occasion they've seemed vaguely surprised that we actually sat down.  But if you're looking for solid Thai food, then you're in luck!    The only barometer of real Thai cuisine is, of course, the Thai iced tea - that sticky-sweet, caffeinated hand grenade of a drink.  Their iced tea varies quite a bit, but it's generally solidly sweet with a touch of water about it, and a strange subtle aftertaste that's unlike any other Thai tea I've had.  (Note: another review claims it's sodium benzoate.) I can't decide if I like that aftertaste or not, but if you're looking for a Thai iced tea, it's pretty good.   The main dishes are fine, with fresh ingredients and tasty sauces - a bit mild for my tastes, but certainly flavorful.  Their peanut sauce is four stars verging on five, and pretty much any main dish you order is going to satisfy.    You can, however, skip the crab rangoon appetizers - they're fried too deep, making them like crispy cardboard, and the crab in the middle is mealy.    This won't win awards for fine cuisine, but if you're looking for the moral equivalent of diner food - stick-to-your-ribs, cheap Thai food - then this will, and does, satisfy."}
{"text":"Super excited to see a Thai kitchen finally open up near me. Came in by myself for lunch. Ordered a lunch special \"green curry\" for 7.50. I am a huge green curry fan. It was pretty good but I didn't like the eggplant in it.  Ice tea is very weak but not a big deal. The restaurant is super cute, modern and clean. Friendly server. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good! Went with my family on a Friday night and it was packed with a wait-- it's pretty small, but recommend you get there early.  I had the spicy noodle with chicken, which lived up to its name! My husband had the red curry with beef, my father had chicken cashew, my sister had tofu fried rice and my BIL had spicy beef. Very good. Would go back!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town. We love Thai food and searched  Yelp. We were in the area and swung over to Thai Kitchen. We got there right at 5\"00. Greeted and seated. Orders taken. Restaurant filled up quickly so new this was a good place. Excellent food. Prices great. Service was good. Staff did not talk much - but good service.  Kept the water glasses full. All 4 of us in party very happy  with our visit. Would certainly come back again when back in town.  Food served quickly piping hot and spicy to the degree we requested a time we placed order."}
{"text":"A pleasant, modestly-sized, family run restaurant.  Since we live east of this place, it is our \"go to\" Thai choice; that having said my partner, daughter, & I have all enjoyed the food -- we've been there something like a dozen times."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food I ever had. The Pad Woon Sen aka \"Crystal noodles\" was disgusting. They put pad Thai orange sweet and sour sauce all over it! It's supposed to be made with oyster sauce.   To top it off, I found a long black hair in the middle of my dish. And they charged me $1 to add cabbage to a plate that should have cabbage in it. We will never return here. AVOID."}
{"text":"I just cannot get enough of this place. It is hands down, the best Thai food I've ever had. The way she does Massaman and Panang Curry is incredible. So creamy and full of flavor! So much more complex than any other place in town. Please stop in and tell your friends."}
{"text":"The place is really small, but very cute. It was not super busy until after I ordered. Call in take out orders came streaming in. I got lucky. Next time I will call my order in first.   I decided to play 'order something random off the menu' and I did not have good luck. I ordered #42 Pad Se Ew. It was not good. I liked the Chinese broccoli that was about it otherwise it was slime-y. Maybe it was supposed to be that way. I have no idea. I can't even eat the rest. The flat noodles just didn't do it for me. My stomach already hurts and I didn't even eat a quarter of my meal.   The spring rolls were super good though. So eh my lunch wasn't all that good. Maybe I will try this place again and just order Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Sadly, I went back ordered Thai fried rice, & chicken pad Thai. The rice was okay, however this time I got the worst tasting pad Thai ever. It had a weird flavor, was completely missing the sweetness and was almost bitter. Due to the extreme inconsistency of flavor, I don't think I will attempt this one again. :(  I was rooting for this business!"}
{"text":"Excellent family run business!! The food is consistent and affordable, the staff is attentive, friendly, and fast, and I always leave satisfied!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered the Spicy Noodle. I ordered medium and he ordered as spicy as they come. One of us ended up sweating and the other one focused on how absolutely delicious it is! I'd order this again and tell my friends about it too. We did take out and the ladies were really nice and laughed at my jokes. Which is a definite plus. Keep doing you Thai Kitchen, keep doing you."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  My fiancé had the yellow curry with chicken. The portion is easily enough for 2 meals. Best curry we have ever had!  I had the pad Thai chicken, it was excellent as well. The service was great. They were busy, & have only been open for 5 days, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Everybody in the restaurant seemed to enjoy their food. This restaurant is a must have if you enjoy Thai food. A great addition to this part of town that lacks good restaurants, we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Its rare that I give a place 5 stars so you KNOW it's a great place if I do! I'm so excited to rant about this place! Everything from the time I entered the door till I left ths place was on point. Service was lighting fast & courteous. I ordered the Pineapple Curry, medium spicey, & it was yummo with a side of delish. I wanted to drink the curry sauce out of the bowl with a straw, but there were other people around. I got there at 5ish and was out by 5:40. I wanted to stay & hang out but they'd probably think i was weird or friendless. Anywho, go here, sit down & try their curry, it's straight up amazingness."}
{"text":"I'd say that a 4-star is about right, but could have gone with 5. I had the panang curry with chicken. It was very good but not the best I've ever had, but I can't really say what would make it better. My son really enjoyed the pad thai with chicken and my step-father enjoyed the broccoli on wok with chicken. His was more spicy and just perfect for him. Price was good too as our three meals came to only $30 including tax."}
{"text":"Holy cannoli batman, this place is my new go to Thai restaurant when visiting this part of AZ.  Yeah, it's THAT good!!!  Scottish homie and I were craving lunchables late in the day, so as usual, I bust out my trusty Yelp app and do a quick bookmark search of places I've been wanting to try in AJ.  I'm easily sold on Thai, since I've already been craving it, so we jump on the bikes and head on over.  We roll in around 3pm, are warmly greeted and order up a couple of Thai Iced Coffees (no cerveza here, so thank goodness for cawfee).  The addictive beverages arrive.  They look delicious and oh so silky brown in color.  We sip.  We savor.  We are utterly delighted at how fucking delicious this coffee is.  Probably one of the best I've ever had......anywhere.  Homie orders yellow curry with chicken and I order the Thai fried rice.  Food arrives.  We sample.  We savor.  We are floored at how delicious and fresh everything is.  I am happy.  Homie is happy.  Life is good.  Aye lad, life is good.   Add to it the relaxing decor and friendly service and you've got yourself a winner.  This is the kind of place that you go out of your way to try because as I said before, it's THAT good.  Next time, I will save room for some coconut ice cream.  I'm sure it'll be as good as the one served up by Fanny at Burma Superstar in sF.  Kahp Kuhn Krahp y'all."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! Favorites are chicken Thai fried rice, sweet sticky rice with mango and their Thai tea! Food is excellent every time! Wish they'd deliver though.. :) Highly recommend to anyone wanting a great meal!!"}
{"text":"Good food and good prices. We always leave full . Kinda of small but that makes it a more cozy and quaint atmosphere. Chicken larb is great but I get rice instead of the cabbage. Not overwhelmingly busy even with the snowbirds in town.  Be aware tho they are closed between 3-5pm on weekdays and I believe they're closed Sunday's."}
{"text":"Most authentic Thai food in CLVLND!  Be sure to order off the white insert menu titled HomeStyle. Also, I really enjoy the generous use of pickled mustard greens and hope you do too - greens are good for you!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was acceptable. We were seated very quickly however our server didn't come to ask us for our drinks until we decided what we wanted to eat. The food came out shortly afterwards which was nice. The waitress then asked if we wanted dessert. We said no. Then we waited like 10-15 minutes and I turned in my chair to find her and then she came up to my table and said \"I thought you didn't want dessert. \" I thought me not wanting dessert means I want the check. In short, the service could have been better.  The food was okay. My boyfriend ordered the pad Thai with a spice level of 3 and I liked it a lot. I ordered the pad see ew with pork and it was okay. I finished it all; however, I felt the pork was a bit gamey. It was not my cup of tea but definitely could be someone else's."}
{"text":"Only been here once, ordered the thai fried rice. It wasnt as good as I expected, there wasnt enough salt. Rice also was a bit greasy. The chicken satay on the other hand was very good. May give them another try."}
{"text":"I'm no Thai food \"expert\". But, I've probably eaten at 8-9 different Thai restaraunts in my life. We LOVE this place, \"Thai Kitchen\".  Service is Awesome. Unless, they are super duper, ridiculously busy. Most Thai places I've eaten at seem to want to get by with less labor, using, maybe 1 Server, who also is the Host & Cashier. When this place is half full or less, you are good. If this place is over half full, don't expect your drink to be refilled as much as you'd like. Which, I like my Thai ridiculously HOT, so, I need the Water & Diet Coke on point. This place is Awesome. Clean. Friendly. Killer food. Nice ambiance. You'll dig it :)"}
{"text":"Out exploring the town looking for a place eat &stumble across Thai Kitchen. We got there 20mins before closing, I was amazed at how many people were coming in to eat or take out. I kinda knew it would be good and to my surprised we enjoyed everything we ordered. The papaya salad was a little different to my tasting but others liked it! The restaurant is a little small for the amount of business that was coming in as I was there. However I would definitely go back &try other foods!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable once again. Thai iced tea was unusually good. Not sure how to describe it. Sweet, I guess, but not overwhelmingly. I get Thai iced tea at a lot of places and it rarely tastes that perfect. The spring rolls were unusually fresh. Coconut curry noodle soup was tremendous. I ordered it pretty spicy (7 on their 0 out of 10) - my goodness, that was hot but so superbly flavored. Love the texture of the noodles. The slight taste of coconut. The heat. Tried my friends' dishes as well and loved all of them, especially the panang and massaman. The owner is also a gem."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and the man and I were looking for a new Thai place to try. Looking over the reviews here on yelp, we decided to give Thai kitchen a shot.  As pointed out in most reviews, this place is small. It's definitely a locally owned place, I could watch them wash the dishes from my seat.  We ordered the spring rolls, and they were delicious! Nice and crispy, filled with vegetables that had a sweetness to them. We both ordered curry. Sorry, I stink at the names, I order the way I paint. By the numbers. We went with a heat level of 4 which was good for us. Nice size serving of rice and curry. Very fragrant. It had a complex taste, layer upon layer of heat sweet savory...downside for me was that the tofu was not browned at all. Just looked like cubes of tofu tossed in the sauce. The man can eat tofu in all shapes, me? Not so much. There was a decent amount of vegetables, but not enough to make me happy about losing all the tofu to soy crispness dysfunction.  To sum it up, we would probably go back here, maybe do a take out. Flavor is very good, I will definitely ask for extra crispy tofu next time. Good flavor for a good price."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and did not have to wait  lucky timing if you ask me since the wait for a table quickly went up to 30 minutes. We had several question about the menu and th e friendly staff answered them all. Now as other reviews stated the wait time for the food was about 30 minutes not too bad for the volume this place does. We had the spring rolls fried and they are pretty kick ass. The spice level on my dish was a 10 and as a hot head I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Thai Kitchen for the first time today.  I had garlic eggplant with chicken which was absolutely heavenly.  The broth was rich, smokey sweet and the eggplant was cooked to perfection.  Generous amounts of chicken in the dish.  One of the best Thai entrees I've ever had - and I can't believe I ate the whole thing.  I'm not kidding, I can hardly breathe.  My husband had the vegetable delight with chicken and ordered it 'Thai hot.'  His was fantastic too, lighter (much hotter) than mine but delicious.  He cleaned his plate too.  Clean, pleasant and no waiting?   We will definitely be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"First time my better half and I went here.   We have really enjoyed Thai food in other restaurants and this opened across from our neighborhood.  I would have given it 5 stars but I dinged them for comfort of their chairs.  They are very hard with little support and padding (not enough to be a deal breaker).  We started with coconut shrimp, followed by spicy noodles with shrimp and fried rice with pork, and finished with the coconut ice cream and creamy rice for dessert.  Everything was absolutely excellent.  The price point is very reasonable (believe around $10 a main plate).  The desserts were awesome!  The portion sizes were excellent, not to little and not to much.  The restaurant was very clean, including what we could see of the kitchen.  Our server was prompt and very personable.  Would recommend to everyone and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Teeny Tiny Thai...  THE UP-SIDE:  Really tasty Thai food at reasonable prices!  THE DOWN-SIDE:  This place is tiny.   ...as in TINY!!!  However, it's never really soooo busy that you cannot get a table (one of five.)  THE SUM-IT-UP:  A great place to hang out and eat yummy Thai food.  If you're taking a date, make a reservation for the table by the window; the only one with any view and not directly in the aisle.  Or, you can opt for take-out and enjoy the great food somewhere with more room."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place because yelp listed as gluten free and they did not disappoint! Entire menu can be gluten free. Split a curry and pad Thai - both outstanding. Also had the mango sticky rice , exquisite ! On top of that , great staff and the owners daughter stopped by our table and spoke with us for a quite a while recommending things to do since we were from out of town. Definitely recommend and will definitely return if in town !"}
{"text":"Would be a 5 for food and service but the crowded tables made it a bit uncomfortable with people bumping into us.  Excellent and abundant food.  Excellent friendly service."}
{"text":"I've been a Banana Blossom fan for a long time but Thai Kitchen has taken over my top spot for best Thai food in Cleveland.  I love this place.  It's a hole-in-the-wall joint  that feels and smells like you're walking down a Bangkok street.  I spent some time in Bangkok so walking in here made me feel like I was traveling again.  It's low on \"ambiance\" but high on quality food and charm - just like the random and friendly Thai vendors in the streets of Bangkok.   Love it.   Also, this place is BYOB.  How freakin' awesome is that?    So, for starters my husband and I ordered the spring rolls, the fresh rolls and a bowl of tom yum soup to share.  The fresh rolls were good but  a little heavy on the lettuce.  I wouldn't order them again.  Spring rolls were amazing:   light, fresh, crisp, straight from the fryer and served with a delicious tangy, spice sauce.  Mmmm.  The soup was absolutely unforgettable. The flavors were layered perfectly and the soup was rich, creamy but light all at once. I first tried this dish in Bangkok and it quickly became one of my favorites.  It has such a unique flavor and tastes so different from American cuisine.  For mains we ordered the pad thai and chicken prik king (spicy chicken with green beans, thai curry and thai spices).  Our food came out quickly and piping hot and the cook leaned over and told me she was so jealous of my dish.  Apparently it was one of her favorites and reminded her of home and she hadn't made it in such a long time so she was so glad I ordered it and that she made it special for me.  Let me tell you, she made the HELL out of that chicken.  MY god it was delicious.  I got it at spice level 5 - which was enough to clear my sinuses but not so hot that I couldn't scarf it down while my husband watched greedily.   All in all, this was an amazing meal. Everything was cooked to perfection and either met or exceeded my expectations (except the fresh rolls).   Amazing food, great service and - bonus! - close to public transit (for all those BYOB wines I plan on carting into this place).    Only negative:  this place is tiny so go with a friend, not a group of friends.  Or get takeout."}
{"text":"Great little gem of a restaurant on Madison in Lakewood, Oh set in a small store front that is easy to drive by if your not looking for this spot. Took my Mother out for lunch and we both enjoyed our meals. My mother started with the Thia Kitchen Tom Yum soup while I went for the traditional Tom Yum. The traditional Tom Yum had nice flavor with a dash of heat, nothing overpowering but noticeable and wanted.   My mother went with one of the curry dishes on a heat level of 4 as her choice, sorry I forgot which one she ordered. I had the H4 option Kitchen Herb and Spice with Chicken at a heat level 5. Both dishes came out shortly after our soup, with enough time not to feel rushed. Got to write I enjoyed the dish. We both added a bit more spice that was brought out with our meals. Next time out I'll crank up the heat but YMMV when it comes to tolerance to spicy hot foods.   Looking forward to coming back and trying some other dishes. The menu is extensive with vegan and once living proteins options. The only minor issue I had was the lack of beer and wine as a beverage choice. I see they have a $2.50 B.Y.O. Beverage options listed on the take home menu per person, per table."}
{"text":"I used to call this one of my favorite restaurants in Lakewood.I guess it still is in my top 10. That's back when the original old man and lady ran the shop. I heard they moved back home and the store was taken over by family. The other night me and my roommates ordered some to-go food. I got the Tofu Pad Thai and soup. The soup was a gamble and I knew it. It was pickled or something.It had tofu and was very interesting.I did not enjoy it so much, however I will not count this against them knowing it just may not be my thing.I just wanted to try it! We ordered at 8:30pm knowing they closed at 9:00pm. Looking back , maybe we should have not ordered right before they closed. The vegetables were very fresh! The Pad Thai was very dry with little to no sauce and bland.I poured some coconut curry soup in it and it was really good.My roommates also complained their meals were a bit dry as well. The next day I ordered Pad Thai again, mentioned it was a bit dry and I had ordered last night. When I got it It was really good and saucy and fresh just like I hoped it would be! Oh the fresh rolls were really good and the spring rolls are amazing. This just went from a 3 star to a 4 realizing they almost always have excellent food. So maybe don't order too late!"}
{"text":"Great curry!   The menu is small but everything I have ever ordered has been fantastic.  It's a family owned place and the curry is grandma's recipe.  Service is polite and helpful but can be overwhelmed during a rush.  I've never seen more than two employees serving tables, but I frequently see all the tables full and a busy carryout service as well so If it's busy settle in for a wait.  You'll like the food here, give it a try."}
{"text":"Everything we have eaten here has been exceptional! The owners are very nice and the prices are fair. Be forewarned though; the food is incredibly spicy. I asked for medium spice and it was still almost too much for me! Delicious nonetheless though :-)"}
{"text":"Thai kitchen does a great job with food allergies and can make almost the entire menu gluten free. There were so many options that I had a hard time deciding which was a nice problem to have. I ended up going with the Thai basil fried rice which was ok. The flavor didn't seem as developed or as spicy as the Thai I'm used to."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch yesterday, it was our fourth visit.   The summer rolls are the best I highly recommend them.   My husband had the curry in mild and loved it.   I had the noodle salad it is a generous portion, I could only eat half, my husband ate the other half for dinner he loved all the peanuts.   Stop by and try it you won't be disappointed.   Leave room for the mango sticky rice for dessert its yummy."}
{"text":"They have the best curry!  The green is my fav.  I'm told that hey make all of the curry pastes from scratch.  The family is super nice and are very inviting.  They bring the heat if you ask for it, I like to cry a little bit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely atrocious!   I had ordered 2 take aways - Pad Thai and Panang Curry... the noodles were like ramen noodles.. had no flavor and were not even mixed well with the vegetables and tofu.. in fact there were barely any vegetables and tofu in the pad thai! The crushed peanuts added were a joke! The panang curry was avoidable! :("}
{"text":"A coupon (buy 1 entree, get 1 free via Verizon points) and great reviews on Yelp led us to Thai Kitchen & we now have our new favorite Thai spot.. Hands down. It also won best curry in CLE for 2015.  Some tips to keep in mind; it is BYOB for $2.50 a person (a store a couple doors down has an ok beer selection). Also, the dishes can be prepared as spicy as you like them on a scale of 1-10; we overheard a table saying 3 is \"pretty hot\" which is what we like.. Got the green curry chicken w/ noodles a 3 and the pad Thai a 2, both AWESOME dishes but I would do the pad Thai spicier next time (a 3) and we can't imagine going any spicier than a 3, or 4 max, for the Green Curry. The appetizer rolls were mostly iceberg lettuce, wouldn't get those again, but because the entrees were so delish and the service, awesome - definitely a 5 star."}
{"text":"Forget the size, atmosphere, etc...the food here is simply awesome.  I got the ginger pork and a Tom Yum soup. The soup was very flavorful, had shrimp and squid in it; both in generous amounts. The ginger pork was simply fantastic! The meat was very soft and the flavors were out of this world. I got a 7/10 on the spicy scale, and as someone who thoroughly enjoys spicy food, 7 was almost too much--I was sweating a bit. So I think I found my ceiling at 7, just enough to make me feel it, not enough to burn a hole in my stomach.   I will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Just a nice place to eat lunch. No panang curry on the lunch specials. But, the ingredients are fresh and decent portions. Friendly and attentive staff. I think this is the eastern most Thai place in the valley, and right off the 60, if that matters to anyone."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!!  The food is delicious, fresh, healthy and tasty!  The atmosphere is warm and unique.  The owner/chef and workers are friendly, kind and welcoming.  The prices are very reasonable as well.   A++++++"}
{"text":"Look past the exterior and try out this Thai joint. The food was awesome and they had a great selection. It is on the smaller side inside but they still have a fair amount of tables. Almost everyone that came in for pickup knew the workers which means.. lot of regular customers (always a great sign). They had a young staff all very very friendly. The food took a while but it was worth it because it was delicious. I had the Pad Thai which was awesome, but next time I go I will probably ask for a level 4 or 5 spice. I did not ask for any spice and it could use some (& I LOVE spice so that was a miss on my part). They also have bubble tea which I know is pretty popular right now. I did not have any but it seemed like a popular order at the tables around me."}
{"text":"Good, the only thing I would say is that it's really cramped inside, but the food was delicious and it came out in a decent amount of time.  The waitstaff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious! As soon as soon as you walk in you are hit with the most amazing aroma. The spicy beer salad was wonderful, all the flavors combined were just perfect! It was a little heavy on the sesame seeds but I'm not complaining. Great dish! The spicy basil with garlic sauce was very good although it was a little salty but still tasty. I ordered it hot and  to me it was more medium I had to add a little more to it. It does have jalapeño so watch out to not get a mouthful. The curry dish (panang curry) is probable the most authentic curry I have tasted in the United States. It tasted just like Thailand. I recommend the curry all the way, superb!!!!  A couple recommendations don't be afraid to ask for Hot or even Thai hot because it really is not that hot. A recommendation to the restaurant if you're going to say that something is thai hot make it thai hot. But all in all this place is wonderful... BRAVO!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant bar none- my favorite used to be Cilantro in Akron. Their massaman curry is to die for. They have the best bubble tea I have ever had- not like the over-sugared drinks you usually get. I highly recommend the melon bubble tea. It does have very limited seating, and we ended up waiting a little for our food, but the chef prepares and creates all of her dishes- she lived in Thailand and went to a prestigious cullinary school. One of the people working there (he might be an owner?) Stopped over and talked to us, telling us about the chef. Very personal and cozy. One of my favorite places to eat. :-)"}
{"text":"Thai Kitchen is the shizzzz!  Seriously...  It's run by a sweet couple who speak broken English. They have some of the best Thai food in town. Service is always great and they are super friendly. When I lived on the west side, this was my go-to place. I love the Pad Thai, the curries and the rice paper rolls.  I can't say a whole lot for the ambiance, it's a bit cramped in there. But I have eaten in plenty of times.  I can't imagine they could accommodate a large group, so if you are entertaining, I would go elsewhere.  If you want some great Thai food at a reasonable price, this is THE place."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during the work week; ordered the chicken pad thai with peanut sauce on the side. Although I was a little dismayed by the outside appearance of the place and fact that the dining room was tiny, with the kitchen right next to some of the tables, the food more than made up for appearances. The portion was large and very flavorful, in addition to being a great value for the price, and it was made exactly how I would have liked it with a choice of spice level. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped  for lunch , could not eat the spring roll, too tough.,both of them.  Dressing on salad was warm, never had it served hot.  Chicken was tough in our dish.  Told the waitress and was not even given an apology."}
{"text":"Lots of vegan choices!!! They had larb tofu on special when I was there - one of my favorites. Also, you can get the Thai coffees and teas vegan as well. The menu offerings are really authentic, with lots of dishes not found at other places. The flavor of the food was fresh. I ordered the red curry with tofu (very good) and was disappointed at the small amount of brown rice served with it. The curry comes in a platter-sized dish, but the rice was barely 1.5 cups. It's a soupy dish- I had to order a second portion of rice to soak up the curry. Good service, but nothing remarkable. It's a little bit pricier than some Thai places, but it shows in the quality of the food. It's worth it for an occasional treat."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've ever had. Prices are fantastic.  The young Thai waitresses are, believe it or not, attentive, fast, and chatty if you want to have a conversation. In between serving tables, they sat playing cards at a table next to my party, and we had a great conversation while we ate.  Everyone who says it's not a \"nice\" atmosphere -- I have no idea what you're talking about. I guess you like overdesigned interiors with fancy silverware and waterfalls and impersonal mood lighting and stuff. Forget all that. This place is FRIENDLY which in my book makes for the \"nicest\" atmosphere I've ever encountered in a Thai restaurant.  The guy complaining about the rice had a good point but whatever. Not enough to drop a star in my book with everything else being perfect."}
{"text":"Friendly and Clean! Super excited to Thai so far out east! My son( he's six) had the chicken fried rice and loved it! I had the soup and it was very good! The portion size for the price is spot on! Definitely give this place a try. We will be back to try other items as well!"}
{"text":"We ate 3 times during the last 4 weeks at this restaurant. This review and the 1 star is for the last time we went there and left again without ordering anything after being treated in a rude way by the female Thai  server. We will probably not come back even if the quality of the food is very good. We would give the cook 4-5 stars. Keep in mind that \"medium\" is more likely \"hot\", I assume that if you order \"hot\", you'd probably get \"fire\". The arrangement of the tables is horrible, you might consider to order your food to go if you want to eat in a nice environment. Even a school canteen is more inviting. The male waiter who serves the food during lunch hours was friendly and polite but the waitress who serves the food in the evening has the customer service skills of a prison guard."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, if you want some of the best traditional Thai food you can find in the Cleveland area this is the place to be. Amazingly large selection of items, and options from beef/chicken/shrimp/tofu. I always get the Pad Thai and Spring Rolls, so delicious, I never am disappointed by them.   My only concern is its a tiny place in an appartment and it doesn't look too...clean, and the large menu kind of questions the freshness of the items they prepare, how many people can be possibly ordering for them to continue having a large menu. I really would wish for them have a large decent spot to offer they're good food."}
{"text":"Yum.  Got Tom Kar and Pad Kee Mao to go and both were fantastic."}
{"text":"This is a 'Straight Ahead Jazz' Thai Restaurant.   Good solid Thai cooking, should hit East Mesa square in the jaw.  I will be back for another ... swing!"}
{"text":"Is there anything better in the world than a small thai restaurant?  My fiance and I went to the Thai kitchen on a \"I don't feel like cooking tonight\" whim. I am so glad we did. Fine dining it is not but it is one of the best thai places in the city. He had Pad Thai. I had one of their many curries. When ordering I was very impressed that the owner/cook/wait person asked for a 1-10 rating of how hot we wanted the food. I asked for a 6, and I received a dish with the perfect level of hot for the curry. MY fiance being a spicy food junkie went for an 8 and well his was spiced accordingly. The chicken in the curry was so tender it nearly melted in your mouth. The veggies were nothing spectacular but coated in that manna from the heavens sauce it really didn't matter. The pad thai was perfectly done. The noodles were not sticky nor chewy which is usually the culprit of a bad pad thai.   Do not miss this little Lakewood gem."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. I love Thai food but it's not easy finding a good restaurant, especially in Mesa. I don't mind spicy but found medium a little too much. I'll order mild next time and there will be a next time."}
{"text":"I loved it!  My partner enjoyed the food, but not so much the strong food smells in such a small place and the sticky table we sat at.    I am sure we will order take out from Thai Kitchen again in the future because the food was good, but I don't know if we'll go back to eat in."}
{"text":"Have dined in and had takeout. Both times I got the coconut curry noodle soup. It is outstanding. I've had coconut curry soup from many places before and this is pretty high up there. The staff is also extremely friendly. If you like Thai I definitely recommend Thai kitchen."}
{"text":"This is a great Bangkok style Thai restaurant. Smallish menu, but the items they serve are prepared correct and delicious! . The Shrimp was not sweet but it was very fresh! The curry was perfect and the Pad Thai was excellent! Aroy jung loi!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for an early supper and it was amazing food!!!  The Thai iced coffee was the best ever!!!"}
{"text":"I just had the best Thai meal that I've ever had in my life at the Thai Kitchen you'll  have to come and try it here the flavors are right on point. The atmosphere is great the people are friendly it's a jewel. I never realized it was here until this year and now I can't stop coming to it."}
{"text":"The portion sizes are small for the price.  My tom yum soup didn't have enough depth of flavor.  More galangal and kaffir lime are needed.  It wasn't acidic/sour enough, nor was it very spicy.  In my opinion, that makes it inauthentic.  Also, there was not much protein (8 half pieces of shrimp, or 4 total shrimp) and hardly any vegetable.  The pot was a clay pot that is much smaller than the large ceramic bowl that you would see in Thailand.  I saw another table with a noodle soup that came in the right kind of bowl for tom yum.  The clay pot mine came in is usually seen for the richer coconut based soup.  The khao soi (a specialty from chiang mai area) was a completely different flavor profile (too much sweetness from peanuts) and resembled more of an african peanut stew.  The service was slow with only one server who doubled as a cashier, but the atmosphere was nice.  While the menu sounded authentic, I probably would not return, though it is the only place I've seen with jungle curry (a red curry without coconut milk)."}
{"text":"My friends & I were in town for the tough mudder & have a tradition of having Thai as a celebratory post run meal. We chose Thai kitchen due to its proximity to our rental.   Pros:  Pad Thai  Thai iced tea (sadly, no refills) Ginger chicken Papaya salad Sweet server who reminds me of my mom   Cons: Our food arrived at various times so by the time one person received their meal, another had finished theirs.   Save room for the coconut ice cream. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Damn good!!!!  Have tried 5 multiple items on the menu and they were all good.  The curry dishes are so good!!!!  Staff is friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm back to the 5-star review because this place has excellent food. Try the jungle curry. It is amazing. This is one of my favorite Thai places in Cleveland.    I am updating my review until next time. I tried to use a coupon from the entertainment book and they refused to take it. I have a real problem with businesses turning down a coupon, because they CHOOSE to be featured in those kinds of promotions. Groupon, Entertainment, etc do not just create coupons for businesses.  If they decide they no longer want to participate, they should cancel their agreement with the website. I just bought my coupon today. The coupon was a buy-one-get-one deal up to $8. Also, none of their entrees are $8. Most are in the $10-$13 range.   I love trying different Thai restaurants. Thai kitchen really impressed me last night when I came in for dinner with my family and a friend. We all ordered something different, so I got to sample 5 different dishes and they were all unique and delicious. I ordered red curry, which is my go to Thai dish when I try a new place. It was very flavorful and had a lot of ginger and lemongrass in it. It wasn't as creamy as some curries I've had but i considered it a nice change and I would definitely order it again. Same with my moms dish, the green curry.  We also had two soups, pad se ew, and a coconut chicken curry at the table. I can't wait to come back and try my favorite Thai dish, the tom yum soup. It looks amazing in photos.  There didn't seem to be a parking lot for the restaurant anywhere nearby, but we found street parking on Madison about a block away. The place is small, only a handful of tables, but we were here around 8pm on a Friday night and we didn't have to wait in line. Most tables were filled as we were there though. Also, prices were right! $10-$12 for most entrees - which is pretty cheap for Thai!"}
{"text":"I'm a Thai food buff from out of town and this place more than met my expectations. Food is served by a sweet Thai lady right on the spot; her daughters are usually staffing the place. The service is great, food is the best in Cleveland by far, and I love how the place is a hole-in-the-wall type joint. The spice level is on-point, I tried a nine and it was all that I could handle. The house-special curries are all favorites of mine and the Tom-Yum soup is spectacular no matter what meat you get."}
{"text":"the bubble tea the mango smoothie the Massaman curry are Beyond delicious. Everyone should come here!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Excellent good. Fantastic service. Thank god it's close to my hospital. And they are open later then a lot of places!"}
{"text":"This place serves my favorite Thai food in the Cleveland area and is among the contenders for best Thai food I've eaten.  In fact, I would say this restaurant contends for the best *food* I've ever eaten.  One of the meals I've had here was among the most memorable meals of my life.  The food here is just amazing.  They don't have the biggest menu, but everything I've tried has been outstanding.  I've had the best luck with ordering the specials--the people who run this place know what's fresh.  The curries are excellent...it doesn't matter what you put in them.  There's just the right amount of spice...everything is balanced...the vegetables are cooked just perfect.  It's so nuanced...but has kick too.  The soups are amazing...and I almost always order the \"fresh rolls\"...the sauce for it is done just right, with a little zing to it.  The atmosphere...the name says it all.  This place is a kitchen (neatly hidden behind a partition) with a few tables out front.  It's nice, but tiny.  It can be hard to get a table on busy nights.  The tables seat two and one of the tables can possibly seat more than two but the bottom line--this is not a place for large groups."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food in Cleveland, fresh, tasty, memorable.  Let John recommend a choice for dinner and spice level.  Love the new decor and ambiance."}
{"text":"This is so far the best Thai food I ever had in the U.S. Everything is authentic!!! Their peanut sauce, fresh roll even the ice tea! I tried the ice tea, satay and PadThai which are just the same taste I had when I was in Chiangmai, Thailand. The decorations may look a little bit outdated and incomparable to those bling bling extravagant Thai restaurants, but this is the place where authentic flavors come! Don't miss it!   The waiter John is excellently friendly and courteously too!"}
{"text":"Thai Kitchen With a Few Tables In It, is probably the best name for the joint. I've been saying it for about a decade: I want Thai food that someone's Thai grandma would make if they didn't know if it was for a white girl that they may think couldn't handle the awesomeitude that is Thai spice.   Done. I mean, they knew I was white but they didn't spare the spice or the love.  I rolled in to order take out about 15 minutes before closing like a jerk, right as they were beginning to break down. No attitude, just wondering what I wanted. I ordered my litmus test: Panang with tofu (the ONLY time I eat tofu, ever) medium spicy. She narrowed her eyes, looked at me and asked on a scale of 1-10 spice so I thought I'd play it safe for now and say 6. Well friends, if that was 6 I don't want to know what 9 may be. The spring rolls were packed with fresh basil, big ol shrimps, cilantro and lots of lettuce and were great counterpoint to the spices.  That said, it was DELICIOUS. It's a tiny operation so you're in for the real family atmosphere but it's cool. Just sit back and relax, order your stuff a little under what you'd consider too spicy for your palate and enjoy. Thai Kitchen: thus furthering my hypothesis that the best ethnic foods are found in dives and strip malls."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I had the summer rolls and pad Thai, both were delicious!! Adorable place, clean and friendly staff. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai food I've had yet! Every single dish we have tried has been amazing! Staff is friendly and atmosphere is cozy. You must try this place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  We stopped in for a quick bite and it looked like the healthiest option in the area.  The ginger root chicken was good,  mild sauce was pretty spicy though.  The summer rolls with shrimp were good.  The lettuce in the rolls was much better than the lettuce in their side salad.  One shrimp per piece in the roll.  Not bad.  Skip the side salad."}
{"text":"If you're not doing take-out, Thai Kitchen is a very very small restaurant with probably 6 or 7 tables that can seat 12 to 14 people max, though I can't imagine it being safe to serve food while stuffing that many people into that small of a space.  If you're looking to dine and there are more than 2 of you, I'd strongly consider either figuring out a plan for take-out or finding another establishment.  The bathrooms--which appear to be community bathrooms used by building's tenants--are out the backdoor.  The food is decent overall--I think a tiny step above what you would get at cookie-cutter take-out place.  I liked the Thai Kitchen Fresh Rolls with the basil, cilantro, mint, and lettuce wrapped in translucent rice paper with your choice of vegetables, chicken, or shrimp.  The peanut sauce for the Chicken Satay was also pretty good, but the actual pieces of grilled and marinated chicken were cut a lot thinner than I've ever seen for a chicken satay.  Our order of a large bowl of Wonton Soup was screwed up, and instead we got some sort of large ramen noodle soup with pieces of barbecue pork.  It tasted okay but wasn't what we ordered (though we were too hungry at the time to wait for a replacement).  For entree dishes, we got salmon in a nice brown curry that came with a side of white rice put directly on the dish.  I was skeptical of the salmon/curry combination but it goes to show you really can put that curry sauce on just about anything.  The shrimp Pad Thai was probably the best dish of the night--particularly because it was not as oily as you often find at other take-out places.  Our last dish was the Khao Goon Chieng, which was fried rice with onions, maybe a small amount of other vegetables, and Chinese sausage.  Together with the satay and the soup, the fried rice was one of the more disappointing dishes of our visit.  Some things to remember:  Thai Kitchen is cash only, and there are no refills on drinks (including your $1.75 glass of Sprite half full of ice).  Overall, I went with two stars based on (1) the space, which is admittedly intimate and cozy in a hole-in-the-wall kind of way, but can quickly spiral out to claustrophobic and impractical and (2) the food, which, as I mentioned before, is probably above a standard take-out place but had a few misses on its own."}
{"text":"My review starts with my over the phone ordering experience. The woman who I initially spoke with was quite kind and helpful. She was willing to explain exactly what was in each dish I inquired about as I have several food limitations and a few allergies. At this point, no complaints at all.   The food was mediocre in my opinion. The one item I was able to try was the pad Thai, and it certainly wasn't the best I've had in Cleveland  and it's not the worst either. The rice noodles were well prepared, chicken well cooked, but overall a bit on the dry side.   My issue with this restaurant came when the order was brought home and it was discovered that a dish that I had specifically ordered with certain things omitted had ALL of those omitted items in the dish. I immediately called to explain the situation and that I would not be able to eat the dish, and that I had specifically asked for these items to be omitted from the dish. This time, I was speaking with a different woman. Her response was not one of apology over the mistake in the order. She put me on hold and I heard her ask someone else about my order (I'm assuming that it was the first woman I spoke with). When she came back to the phone, she said \"well, you have to pick out the stuff that you can't eat.\"  Are you serious? No offer to remake the dish that was their mistake, no apology... I most definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this joint I leave a happy camper!!! I usually order a curry that I'm in the mood for, or a noodle dish - Pad Thai is my favorite noodle dish to get and I'm never disappointed! I wish the curries came in a bowl that was larger, but the rice helps fill you up and if you have leftovers and rice at home, it makes amazing leftovers!!! Make sure you save that sauce no matter what!!! Their Thai Iced Tea is also delicious and doesn't taste artificial at all! Definitely recommend giving this place a try, you won't be disappointed (hopefully)!!"}
{"text":"Newest addition to the list of restaurants in East Mesa. Thai Kitchen offers descent Thai food. I've had better ones. I think their curries are very good. We enjoyed a Tom Yum soup with shrimp (amazing!) Red Curry with chicken, Yellow Curry with beef, Lard Na with chicken and sweet and sour chicken and a Thai Iced tea of course! Everything was delicious. I just think serving them with a little more rice would be nice. Also, while the lunch specials during the week are fabulous, I think that offering kid's size meals for a reasonable price would be excellent...especially for families like us that have several kids. Overall, the food is good and the place is super clean with nice decor!!!"}
{"text":"We come from San Diego where Thai food eateries proliferate with successful establishments. The place is average. Salad with lunch is iceberg lettuce with some bland peanut sauce. The rest ok. Thai Patio  on Power Rd in Mesa  is now  our choice. It rocks. Same price and excellent food. I wish for them to succeed but for now we go to Thai Patio even though it is further from Gold Canyon."}
{"text":"Pad Thai amazing, Red Curry amazing, egg rolls amazing. I'm so glad we have a great Thai place so close to use. I lived in La for 11 years and never found a place this good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem! The ingredients are fresh and the sauce is original and amazing!   The lime water was also great, not as good at the roots \"lemon juice water\" made by gabby on the secret menu, but worth noting!  You can't go wrong - 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time here and we expected excellent food, good sized portions, etc.  from reading all the reviews.  Outcome: Beyond disappointed!!  Small portions of meat and, they messed up our order - we asked them to eliminate certain vegetables from the dishes and they did not, even after repeating our order when we placed it; All the meats were bone dry and overcooked in the combos (beef, chicken, pork and shrimp).  There was no sauce for the noodles and rice.  And, for each entree we asked for the combo meat (chicken, pork, beef and shrimp).  There were two pieces of each and they were so small and all were dry and overcooked.  We will never go to Thai Kitchen again or recommend this place.  Take note, if you're craving awesome Thai food, head to Payne Avenue (Map of Thailand) or Tremont  (Thai Fun Bistro) or Charm Thai if in North Royalton/Parma/Strongsville area, if you're craving  awesome Thai food.  Stay away from Thai Kitchen!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I gave this restaurant 2 stars is because the service was good, the employees were friendly, and the food was actually spicy upon request. Other than that, I would not return here unfortunately  We ordered 2 pad thai dishes, one with chicken, one with beef. One red beef curry dish. One Pad Se Ew with chicken  The meat portions are ridiculously small compared to everything else in the dishes. On top of that, the chicken was way overcooked and dry, and I swear the beef in one of our pad thai dishes smelled \"funky\" (the only way I can describe it). The noodles were just ok, the little bit of sauce on the bottom was flavorful but the dishes overall were so lackluster.  The pad se ew was probably my favorite of all the dishes because it was a great mix of sweet and spicy (5/10 requested) and the chinese broccoli had a nice crunch. But, like the other dishes, there was barely any meat. I definitely kept eating tofu and egg thinking that it was chicken and kept being disappointed =(  The red curry was also pretty good and flavorful, but I wouldn't have been surprised if they mixed our dish up with a vegetarian dish....that's how little beef there actually was."}
{"text":"Loved this place when we went there. Eating in had a very home-like atmosphere, like being at a friends house. The staff was friendly, and took the time to answer the numerous questions we had about the menu. The food was top notch, both entree and dessert. I'd say this is hands down the best Thai food I've had in the area. If you're around here, make sure to stop in!"}
{"text":"We ate here last evening, excited to find such a close Thai restaurant. The staff seated us immediately and took our drink order. We both had excellent Thai tea and then the spring rolls that were outstanding. Our main courses were a bit disappointing. I ordered beef massoman, medium spicy, and my husband ordered panang with chicken, hot spicy. Mine arrived and it was super spicy!  My husband's panang was super hot which he loved. Mine was so spicy that I was only able to eat a small amount. When tasted by my husband, he agreed that it was hot, not medium spice. So only order mild if you can't eat it hot,hot, hot!!! The flavor in both dishes was just OK, and mine was lacking enough beef with my husband's loaded with chicken. Our dessert was Thai coconut ice cream. It was just like we had in Thailand - not overly sweet, and loaded with shredded coconut. Very refreshing. Overall, I will come back to try other dishes in order to give this restaurant a second chance."}
{"text":"This quaint little spot in Lakewood is for sure more than meets the eye. The place probably sits no more than 20 people but it's well worth the limited seating. Went here for a quick dinner with my Girlfriend yesterday. We started off with spring rolls which were small but very good. The dipping sauce really hit the spot. Afterwards for the main course, I ordered a coconut Thai curry soup. The spice level can vary  from  1-10. I chose 7 and it was just the right amount of spice without overtaking the flavor. The broth itself (which is what makes the dish in my opinion) was fantastic."}
{"text":"First time I had great experience.. Great food good service ! Second time not so.. I ordered green curry which the guy himself suggested at level 4 spiciness. It's was burning my mouth and stomach. When I politely asked them to fix it, they suggested I add sugar to it.. I ended up paying for the food and leaving right away. So do try the restaurant but be very careful of their spice level scale."}
{"text":"The future Mr and I checked out this place for the first time. It came recommended by a coworker of mine. As other reviewers have stated it is small and cramped inside. I get the feeling that most of their business is take out.   My fiance ordered the Thai salad with the ginger dressing and the basil kitchen speciality. The dressing on the salad was amazing and should be bottled! His main dish was good nothing special. Tasted good but had little spice.   I ordered the crispy spring rolls and chicken pad tai. The rolls with the peanut dipping sauce were great. Wish there had been more than just 2 with the order. The pad tai was good, nice subtle heat. However I have had better. I also had a thai iced tea with my dinner which was very tastey and delicious! For dessert we ordered the vanilla ice cream over the sweetened sticky rice...definitely nothing to write homr about.   Overall our first experience here was good. Not sure that we will be back anytime soon. And if/when we do return, more than likely will be for take out."}
{"text":"Nice little spot, convenient to the Griffin Cider House across the street. Service was friendly but not very professional. The food was good but not great, and a little on the pricey side for the quantity served. It was clean, and the open kitchen concept was good. Probably would not go back, given the many options in the area."}
{"text":"I continue to be wowed by the food from this restaurant.  It is the best Thai I have eaten. I feel like a little bit of gourmet Thailand came to Cleveland. Can't wait to eat my way through the menu."}
{"text":"This is aunt incredible restaurant that anyone in the area needs to visit! The food is fresh, everyone is very friendly and helpful. Everything is extremely affordable. I will always return here."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I had a craving for some pad thai and was BLOWN away. I called and ordered and the gentleman on the phone was incredibly helpful and nice. He assisted me in the spiciness on a scale 1-10 and broke it all down for me. We decided to go with a 3 to try first. I also ordered a side of spring rolls. Not know where this place actually was of Madison, not going to lie, little weary of the outside, but inside was adorable. They have about 5/6 tables and were all FULL! I definitely want to come back here and eat inside. As I took my food and left about 4 minutes later they gentleman called me and mentioned he actually gave me a 4 on the spice scale and told me what to do if it was to spicy. I said it was ok and was def impressed by the customer service. If ever have a Thai craving...this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"5 stars for this hidden gem!! So healthy and delicious - Kwan (the chef) buys all of the produce fresh and prepares the meals right as they are ordered. Nothing is frozen (even the salmon!)   The flavors in the red chicken curry dish that I ordered were so authentic and delicious!  Don't be deterred by the size of this joint - it's AMAZING :)"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service hasn't changed. Instructions on no onion were ignored. Asked for refill of iced tea but didn't give me sugar they monitor their caddies very carefully apparently, and didn't give me anymore when they refilled my tea"}
{"text":"Against my better judgement, I decided to go here for. The food has always been subpar but my husband really wanted Thai food.  Amongst the things were ordered was the 'khao rad  nar '. Guys, this was so bad, bland and tasteless. I literally took one bite and sent it back.   Well, at the end of the 'dining' experience, my bill included this awful entree. From past experiences, Restaurants usually absorb this cost as a courtesy. I pointed this out to the waitress and I heard the cook say, \"it's not my fault she doesn't like it\". Her cavalier comment was so off putting and definitely solidified my resolution to never go here again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  The real deal for authentic Thai food.  We recently hosted a dinner party for 18 and their menu suggestions were perfect.  So much better than what I had chosen.  Everyone loved the food.  Their Pad Thai is excellent!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here countless times. Every dish is delicious, and it is the best Thai food in the Cleveland area. I have tried about 1/3 of the menu, the curry's are superb, the pad Thai is delicious. Kwan, the cook, makes several house and hometown specials that I think are the best of all. Thai Kitchen caters to vegans, allergies, and can make most dishes gluten free.  I come here about once a week, and highly recommend it as a must stop in Lakewood."}
{"text":"My family and I went a couple of weeks ago. I got the Egg Noodles and it was AMAZING!!!! I can't wait to go back! Delicious! Friendly staff! Everyone left happy :)"}
{"text":"Today we tried some different items at Thai Kitchen. I'll back up a minute and say that since day one, this restaurant has been relaxed and comfortable, clean and friendly. I love chatting with the staff while waiting for takeout.   Today's choice was pad Thai shrimp, pad Thai tofu and pineapple fried rice with pork. Of course, we never leave without sweet sticky rice and a Thai iced tea. Both of those are always perfection.  The pad Thai was spiced perfectly to order. The shrimp and tofu were plentiful in their respective dishes. For my taste, these were too many onions and sprouts and not enough noodle, but it was perfect for my husband's taste. The pineapple fried rice was a pleasant surprise. It was sweet and salty, perfectly cooked, with a little kick at the end (again spiced to order).  Though I was not entirely impressed when I first tried Thai Kitchen, this place has grown on me. I certainly appreciate any local businesses that values customer service and remembers regulars. We will certainly be back to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Really good food, home cooked, at a reasonable price - it's not dirt cheap, but neither is the quality. This place is a neighborhood staple that has made some capital improvements over the years, but it still feels like the food is from a grandmother's recipe book. I've never had any dish here that seemed anything other than freshly made, fresh vegetables, etc. They serve you the spice level that you request, so be cautious if you're thinking of ordering an 8 or 9!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I just don't like Thai food in general, but the food here was disgusting. Sure presentation was pretty, service was friendly and attentive but food was gross!!! From the appetizers (egg rolls in what looked like plastic wrap and lettuce wraps with a gross orange peanut filling) to their pad see ey (salty mushy flavor) to their iced coffee that was wayyyy too sweet.  Yuck won't be back. Also we couldn't use their bathroom b/c it had no light?? wth?"}
{"text":"I was excited to see some Thai food come to my neck of the woods. Once I saw the \"OPEN\" sign flick on, I wandered in to fix my Curry Craving. I thought the décor was cute! It's comfortable, and inviting; A place I would meet a friend for a casual lunch. The employees were more than polite, and happy to help with any questions. You are able to see straight into the kitchen, which always gives me an odd sense of  trust. The food was good, but I felt it to be slightly bland for Thai Food. If I'm on a mission for a quick fix, I may stop in, but there are a few places I may choose first. - This is a fairly new business, so they may need a little trial and error before they're able to nail it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost a year and tonight would be the last time that I'm going here, At first it was a great place to go for a meal, Now the quality and quantity of the food has gone downhill, I always order pad Thai , tonight I ordered it , was just a slimy plate of brown noodles with grease at bottom of plate! The one other thing that did it for me was the order of shrimp spring rolls which was a lot of lettuce and ONE shrimp!!! In each one, long time customer but DONE!! This this place!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was really small, but service was pretty good. Staff were nice and friendly. Food took a little to arrive. Tasted really good and world definitely go back again."}
{"text":"As a first time customer I was very satisfied. It's a cute little restaurant tucked into a shopping center. I ordered the yellow curry chicken and it was perfect. Just perfect. The flavor and the spiciness were absolutely  on point. My husband ordered the spicy basil dish and he might as well have licked the plate he loved it so much.  The food came out  very quickly. The waitress was very nice and helpful with suggestions. She even noticed my husband on the phone writing on his napkin and brought him a notepad! It was a thoughtful gesture. I definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"We found a LIVE WORM on the larb. Despite that, the owner was extremely rude and was not apologetic what so ever. God knows how many worms we have ingested before discovering that green worm crawling around. With that being said the owner was completely rude instead of apologizing for this predicament. And yes I hd frequented this restaurant before as the food is tasty but never again"}
{"text":"First time eating Thai- very good. Got a spicy level 10, not the spiciest I've ever had, but still very tasty."}
{"text":"We're having a family gathering in Mesa this week and staying close to Thai Kitchen. We decided to place an order to go and also decided on all vegetarian. Once I explained that we wanted only vegetarian, the person who took my call totally understood. We ordered 8 different dishes - red/green/yellow curries, pad thai, pineapple fried rice, vegy deluxe,  sweet & sour veggies, & crystal noodles. They rocked this order. Each dish was delicious. In order to accommodate everyone, we had all dishes mild and they gave us extra chile for those of us who wanted our food more spicy. Perfect. I will definitely be going back before we leave at the end of our week."}
{"text":"Very delicious Thai food !!! The noodle soups on their menu are my personnel favorite. They're all amazing and come in nice big portions. I recommend my go to order which is always the coconut curry noodle soup."}
{"text":"I freakin love Thai Kitchen and I can't believe I haven't given them a proper shout out on Yelp.  I've had Pad Thai all over Cleveland and I find that Thai Kitchen has the best.  I don't order anything else because we (Pad Thai and I) have such a committed relationship.  I would feel disrespectful, dishonest, disturbed...pretty much all the disses in the dictionary if I cheated on the Pad Thai at Thai Kitchen.  I usually get carry out, but they have a nice little dining area.  This place gets pretty crowded at dinner time on Friday.  Came here around 6:15 PM to dine in without having to wait for a table.  However, 15 minutes into my meal I noticed a lot of people coming in, only to leave because there were no tables available and waiting was kind of awkward, because there is no where to sit while you wait for an open table. Service is quick, but can be a little rushed and spotty as the place fills up. Trust me though, it's worth it. Just be patient and make sure you bring some beer/wine from home (It's BYOB, and they only charge $2.50 per person)"}
{"text":"Visiting OH for an overnight business trip and found this on Yelp.  What a pleasant surprise!   Tasty food and family service, love this place!  Will come again when I visit Cleveland next!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Thai in the city. Fresh, delicious and great service to boot. This is my new go-to place for Thai."}
{"text":"The food was dry and terrible-no sauce whatsoever. We ordered this take out so we could have a relaxing night in. When we called to tell them about it, the manager told us to bring the food back in so they could refund us. We told her that we were in for the night and not making the drive back to show them how bad the food was. When she told us she wouldn't do anything unless we brought the food back in and we told her we would just write a bad review she said \"ok\". Worst customer service ever! Will never eat from this place again."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! I've eaten here at least a dozen times and the food is consistently great. Great service and reasonably priced. This is one of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"Bad food. Had high hopes but it was disgusting pad Thai. It tasted like it was 3 days old"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai food that we have found in east valley. Always friendly, always quick, never mess up an order and most importantly... delicious food!  I always get either the green curry tofu or the Pad Thai tofu. My husband likes the pad see ew which is also great. I really like the eggplant that they add to their green curry, a major pregnancy craving these past 9 months! Haha and you can't go wrong with a couple of Thai teas. If you dine in they come in some cute little glasses. The decor is different than many other Thai places that I'm used to. It's much more modern, love the elephant pillows, the lighting and chalkboard. Love it and I highly recommend this place for some exceptional Thai food."}
{"text":"Thai kitchen used to be a little slice of heaven in a world of shit. Well the world caught up with it. The real Thai Kitchen folks sold it to this new cadre about two years ago. Saddest day since I had to put my friend's dog to sleep for him (he was out of town) in 2006.  My favorite birthday present in my adult life was a Thai Kitchen gift certificate.  Walking in I used to be happy immediately. Now the vibe has changed. Magic is no longer on the radio, now its something annoying.  They've tried to fancy it up and jacked up the prices (and put a dumb sign up). If its gonna be fancy put vegetables in the vegetarian dishes. For real, what the fuck? Tofu on noodles? It used to be broccoli, cauliflower, carrot flowers, mustard greens. Killer. Now sad lonely tofu without a veggie friend. And I feel like an asshole because I used to rave about the place. Once this wasted hillbilly hippie wigger stubbled in shoving money at the former cook lady saying \"just give me whatever for this much. Here's some more.\" He turned to me and my pal and said \"Best Asian Food in Birdtown.\" \"Damn straight\" we replied.  Now those words make me cry."}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful and sleekly designed.  Everything was fresh and seasoned well.   We had the beef salad, red curry, tom Kai soup, and spicy noodles.   Everything was so good!!"}
{"text":"Best thai food in the Phoenix area!  I love all the decorations it's very cute! I had the thai coffee and honestly it's better than any coffee on starbucks menu, and the pineapple fried rice was on point.  Lastly, coconut ice cream was THE BEST, it tastes just right and not too sweet!"}
{"text":"First visit I had green curry chicken with veggies, brown rice, hot tea, and a green tea bubble smoothie for dessert. Word of mouth brought me here and I love these small, unassuming places!  I tried somthing different off the menu all three times I've been here.  The curry, the slow cooked chicken soup and the pad Thai.  All were good, not great, but very good.  Went back again per the suggestion of another Yelper.  Ordered the chicken satay with peanut sauce (very good) and the coconut curry soup with chicken because other reviews said it was good.  The server asked how spicy I wanted It, I told her that I dont mind a little heat, but want to taste the other flavors as well.  Soup came out way to spicy and  so temperature hot it took the ice out of my water and 10 minutes before I could eat it.  SorryThai Kitchen after 4 trips you're a three star."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner here.  Mom had Grandma's chicken soup and loved it.  I had the awesome Tom Yum soup.  Ordered it hot.  It was HOT!  It was almost too hot but not quite.  The atmosphere was very nice.   I would recommend it.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"First visit, last visit.   I checked out their website to see what they have as their house specialty dishes. They have listed on their website 3 house specialty items.  When I arrived about 8:35 pm I asked the guy at the counter to tell me about their house specialty dishes. He said they don't offer any house specialty dishes. Ok, maybe you should learn your restaurants specialties, or maybe you just put those on your website to occupy space, who knows.  Anyway, I decided to skip that if he wasnt familiar with it. I decided to order the beef red chili curry in coconut milk with pumpkin, broccoli, bell pepper and basil, Thai Spicy. I also ordered pad se-iew.  Let me preface this by saying I am no stranger to spice in food, nor the effects of it. I thrive on spicy food. I eat meals with heat spices daily, up and including to the holy grail ghost peppers.  To me there wasn't a tremendous amount of heat to their thai spicy version. Now I can say the average person would probably be in trouble.  The noodles were pretty darn good.  However, that isnt my issue, these two are and the 2nd even more so.  There was only 3 slices of beef in the red curry dish, very few vegetables. It was filled only half way. A quarter of the way up with the veggies and beef and the rest was liquid to the center of the quart container. That is unacceptable for $10.  However, within about 2 hours of eating, my stomach was hurting. Not from spices, but bad food feel. Within an hour of that time the porcelain was calling. For the next 18 hours I was visiting there 2-3 times an hour. I finally had to take some pills to get it to stop. I am not sure what you are doing, as I see on other reviews also and I am certainly not the only one who has experienced this at your establishment, but figure it out. That was a nightmare."}
{"text":"Wow. Absolutely love this little hole in the wall. Thai kitchen tom yum is better than the traditional tom yum, and spicier. The papaya salad was perfect at 5. Refreshing and spicy. Can't beat pad thai with chicken and mango with sticky rice to finish. My only tip, the hibiscus tea is amazing! What kills it for me is the level of sweetness. Order with ice water to dilute to iced tea perfection if you don't have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"We spent 3 months in the area, this is the only restaurant we visited more than once.   The food was excellent, presentation good and personable, efficient service.  Price is great - especially at lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent flavors, I had the Panang curry with chicken, medium spice & a Thai ice tea. Spice level was just right. Good service, very friendly. I love Thai food and eat it a lot, so I've had Thai all over the valley. I'm on the far East side at the moment, so I'm very happy to have found a place close to me that has such good food!!! I will definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"Awesome friendly service,  very clean, always Fresh and Tasty food.  We Love going once every couple weeks.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town! Everything is fresh and authentic. You can taste the freshness in the ingredients, it's not made with a readymade paste. Will definitely be back more often."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food! Very friendly staff. We had the Green Curry and the Tom Yum soup (medium hot). Both were delicious and there was some heat for it being medium. Glad to have a Thai restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"So on Wednesdays they allegedly close at 9...we showed up at 8:40 and the door was locked? I absolutely hate when businesses do that...some service and regard for your customers."}
{"text":"Cute little place yo eat in or take out.  Pad Thai with shrimp hot was delicious.  Great menu!  Love it They do not use pad Thai noodles anymore.  Total bummer."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The Thai hot is amazingly HOTT!! Nice environment, family friendly. Very much enjoyed ourselves here!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. Still love it after years of getting food from here. Still our favorite Thai place in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent spot for Thai food. I didn't care for the potstickers, they seemed very bready and thick but my main dish was good. I personally like a lot of veggies in my spicy noodles and they definitely fell short on that but the flavor was good and service was good too. I would give 3.5 if I could give half points but since I can't I went with a three. Extra veggies or better potstickers would have earned a 4 and if both were improved then I would have given a 5."}
{"text":"Owned by a genuinely nice Thai couple for the past 14 years, Thai Kitchen is disappointing if you're looking for a nice atmosphere.  However, if you're willing to look past the unassuming exterior and small and cozy interior, you'll find some tasty home-cooked genuine Thai food.  Just glance at the menu and you'll know that you've come to an authentic place.  I found a lot of items that I haven't seen since I was in Thailand - basil chicken fried rice, a slew of noodles and curries, and an amazing ginger tea.  On top of all that, I found that the cooking didn't use a lot of MSG, which is usually used as much as salt in most Thai restaurants.  We had Tom Yum Koong, Green Curry with Shrimp, Basil Chicken Fried Rice, and a Ginger Tea - all of which came out to $31 incl. tip.  I can imagine that most people probably take-out from here, but I highly suggest eating at the restaurant - there's a charm to the place that makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"I've been patronizing Thai Kitchen for years.  Mostly takeout.  My favorite is Pad Thai.  Just for kicks I'd occasionally try it from other places.  And you know what?  *NOBODY* makes is as good as the Thai Kitchen!  The new owners use a slightly different recipe, but it s still as good as the old one.  Thai Kitchen is small.  You get the feeling that you've actually been invited to a friend's HOME when you  go there.  Service is very personal.  You can't beat it!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here yesterday since our usual Thai place was closed. This place is a little bit of a drive for us from baseline and higley but it was totally worth it. We had egg rolls, chicken satay, pineapple fried rice, gyoza, yellow chicken curry. Everything was spot on and just awesome. The lady who catered to us was extremely pleasant and smiling which made the experience so much more better. We would highly recommend this place and we are going back here again for sure."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience of my life. Was the food any good? Don't know because the level 3/10 spice Green Curry was so spicy i couldn't eat it. I went there tonight with my son who praised the food based upon a previous visit.   I ordered Green Curry w shrimp, a dish I've had and enjoyed many times over the past 35 years all over the world. The server asked how spicy i would like it, on a 1-10 scale. I know Green Curry can have some kick (not as severe as Red) so i said 3. My son ordered Masaman, level 2.   My dish arrived 10 minutes after my son's. A good while later,the Masaman arrived. It looked great. Then i took the first bite. Whoa!!!. This was intensely spicy, hardly a 3/10 level for Green Curry. More like a 6-7. I couldn't eat it without fits of hiccups.   I tried it with rice without any difference so I tactfully asked the server to come over and explained that the curry was so spicy i couldn't eat it. I explained that I ordered  a 3/10 level, which should be mild. He sent someone over with sugar and suggested i sprinkle that on the curry to reduce the spiciness. Huh?  Server comes back and i said it was too spicy to eat, repeating that this 3 tasted like a 7 or like Red Curry heat level.   Manager comes by and i repeat my explanation. Does she offer to remake it, suggest another dish, offer a refund or apologize? Nope. Instead, i get a lecture on Green Curry being spicy, that the menu described it that way and i should've  known better. She said \"they cooked it as it was described, there was nothing they could do, that they did their job.\"   I asked her why they asked what spiciness 1-10, if a 3 is too spicy to eat. It's their restaurant.  If it's impossible to prepare a Green Curry mild, then don't offer your customers 1-10 spice levels. Say the least spicy they can make that dish is medium, 5+ level. Offer a refund, another dish, show some customer service and respect instead of telling a customer \"too bad, nothing we can do.  Rude, condescending, hostile. Worst customer service ever with absolutely no interest  in resolution. Tough luck customer. We've got your money and don't give a damn if you ever come back  Oh, and when my son called to speak to the owner a half hour after we left to discuss it, she used repeated profanity and told him F you.  Yeah, don't think I'll set foot in that dump again in my lifetime.      Way to give Lakewood fining a black eye."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Thai food, and I read good things about this restaurant so me and my friends decide to try. It is a Friday night they were pretty busy, a lot people ordered take out. we ordered spring roll, tom yum soup pad thai and yellow curry. Their Menu has a lot choices, the spring roll was fine come with typical Thai chilli sauce. The Tom yum soup was below par. I ordered with tofu , it is pre-fried tofu with a not too warm center. The vegetable in there are a lot inedible white part of green onion, and napa cabbage that you can buy for 69 cents in an Asian grocery store.it with one piece of mushroom. it wasn't flavorful enough at all. I was pretty disappointed but I was still looking forward to my Pad Thai. I wanted it a bit spicy and the waiter told me I can put my own spice.  when my pad thai came I know it was another disappointment, It looks really plain with not much color. which I was right, the sauce was very watery, feels like they boil the noodle in water and didn't drain it properly  and put the sauce on it. they barely stir-fried it.. when I mentioned this to the owner, he started to trying to give me a lesson saying every Thai restaurant has a different way to make pad thai blah blah .... this is how they make it.. I didn't want to argue with him and being polite.... but I at least been to 10 Thai restaurants around the area. and I have been to Thailand, I at least know Pad Thai should be s stir fry noodle not noodle topped with water sauce....My friends curry was fine ... I would not go back to this place ... But pad thai is a benchmark dish for a Thai Restaurant...and the owner was too full of himself .... not recommended ..  it is really cold inside since their door open directly to the outside.. food gets cold too."}
{"text":"Horrible Disrespectful Customer service!!  First off let me start off and say I am not one to leave many reviews good or bad but I had to take the time to share my experience. Yesterday evening I visited this restaurant about 8:45pm in the evening. When I first walked in I was greeted by a pleasant young gentlemen who offered me a menu for take out. I have been to this restaurant maybe 3 or 4 times in the past but it had been at least 6 months since my last visit. I am not very familiar with the menu as this not a place I frequent. Shortly after receiving my menu a tall European man approaches me to let me know that the restaurant stops taking orders at 8:45 for take out and that I need to place my order promptly. I said sure no problem with a smile and the gentlemen then walked away. The pervious time I was there I had ordered some kind of spicy beef dish with stir fried noodles but I was not quite sure on the name. I then go on to describe the dish to the cashier and he suggested a 2 different dishes both of which had peanuts that of which I was not really fond of. Fast forward about 4 minutes later the Tall European man approaches me again this time in a very aggressive tone like someone who is scolding there child \"YOU NEED TO PLACE YOUR ORDER LIKE NOW!  I MEAN RIGHT NOW! Now mind you they have a very large menu at least 5-6 pages and the young man at the register was very nice but was not very helpful in identifying the dish I was looking for.  I have never in my 35 years of living receive such poor customer service. I try my best to always respect people no matter where I go. I have worked in the hospitality business so I understand every one wants to get home to there family but at the same time why not come over and help them figure out what they are looking for. Appreciate your customers there the ones who keep you in business. Don't treat them like there bad little children.  Needless to say I thanked the young gentleman at the register and quietly waked out. I then got in my car and drove right down the street to Thai Thai. They were thankful for my business and got my order out quickly. Sad to say I will not be returning to Thai kitchen, They have pretty good food but you just cant treat people that way."}
{"text":"For Lakewood, OH this is pretty good Thai.  I'm sorry but if you're used to eating Thai in Boston, NYC, SF or Seattle you'll be a little let down.  The prices are reasonable and the food is good enough to bring you back when you need to get your Pad Thai on.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly staff, uncomfortable seating. Loved the intimate feel and the proximity to home!"}
{"text":"Small and charming, the food was really good and the service extremely caring. If you're looking for a first date place, this might not be it, as the ambience isn't very impressive, but the food absolutely is!"}
{"text":"Best pad thai I've had in the East Valley, and the potstickers were great too! I also had fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"I visited Thai Kitchen for the first time last Friday evening for the first time, and I am sure it will not be my last.  Certainly I found the quality to be the best of any Thai restaurants in the metropolitan area, and I have been to all of them.  The portion sizes were quite generous and the prices were reasonable.  The only problem is that I asked for \"Thai hot,\" or 9 on the 10 scale and I was warned not to do that, I was talked down to \"6,\" and it was sort of bland.  Next time I will asked for 10.  Unlike Emet D., I thought the Spring Rolls were unique, very large and tasty.  Everything was very fresh.  If you like Thai food and live in the Greater Cleveland area you owe yourself a visit to Thai Kitchen.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"By far the best Yellow Curry I've ever had.  Friendly staff and cozy atmosphere. Will be back loved it."}
{"text":"The Thai Kitchen is a tradition for my family. When it's cold and wet outside, we all bundle up and head over to Birdtown for a yummy plate of Thai food.  They have a huge selection of food. Soups, curries and traditional dishes are their main fare. My usual order is a pot of jasmine tea, spring rolls and a big bowl of Ba-Mee Moo Daeng. On my last visit, I had some sort of chicken cashew stir-fry. it was pretty good, but it didn't really hit the spot for me. I found myself missing my usual order.    The restaurant itself is pretty small, so it's best for smaller groups. That being said, it is a step up from their old space which sat around 10 people total. I'm so happy that this restaurant has  really come into its own. It's definitely one of Lakewood's hidden gems."}
{"text":"Horrible experience I have never written a review before but this place left me so upset!!! Went in with my mom and my 2 kids and the server roled her eyes when I asked if we needed to wait to be seated. She them said (frustrated) that she would clean a table so we waited. She was kicking chairs out of her way and looking at my kids with a disgusted look on her face and rudely told them to move. Obviously she doesn't have kids. The few other tables that were already seated were staring at her and it was obvious they noticed her behavior. My mom and I didn't wait for her to clean a table off we got my kids and left. Before I left I went up to her and told her she should be nicer to people. I understand having bad days. I'm a server too. But she was just plain rude. It's a shame because I live down the street and was excited to try this place. I'll never go back and I have told several friends about this place. They won't be trying it either. Maybe they need to hire staff that actually wants to work? Just a thought."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and eat it quite often. Thai Kitchen (TK) recently opened in my neighborhood and I couldn't be more excited. The food is delicious and fresh and the restaurant owners are very nice and easy to deal with. I generally visit Thai Kitchen 1 time a week and I have also referred my co-worker and her family to TK and they may frequent it more than I do. :)"}
{"text":"I stopped at Thai Kitchen last night for the first time, and got take-out. The spring rolls and Pad Thai were both delicious! I will probably choose a lower spice level next time, as I was a bit surprised by some of the spices used. This is very authentic food, and not \"Americanized\" pad thai that you might get at a fusion restaurant.  If you want to dine in, be advised that the space is VERY small. There is one table that can accommodate a group of 6, and then there are 3 or 4 tables for two, and that's it. I actually waited outside while they prepared my food, because I felt cramped. I will definitely phone ahead next time."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and even though this is our second visit, our experience still isn't stellar. The Panang is good and you can never go wrong with a good Tom Yom soup. The service is so so and nothing makes our experience fantastic. So if you are looking for decent food and mediocre experience,  this is the place."}
{"text":"I'm actually obsessed with this place, after having only been here once. The owners are adorable, a true family business. The food was delicious. I started with Thai iced tea, and my friends and I ordered a few appetizers. The peanut sauce for Tver chicken satay was so flavorful. It was the peanutiest peanut sauce I've ever had. I also tried the pad kee mao. Delicious, yet again. I ordered a side of the sticky rice as well. So good. Stickiest sticky rice I've ever had. Gotta love that starch. For dessert, I ordered bua loy, an option I've never seen a Thai restaurant before. Absolutely amazing. Rice balls in warm coconut milk. Not too sweet. Just perfection. Highly recommend this place. I left with the desire to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last week Thursday (7 September 2017) with a friend and I loved it. I realized that I came here before about 3 weeks ago on a weeknight when I ordered takeout. The meal I had this time around was much better. I can't remember what I ordered the last time.  Customer service is so awesome. I can't tell you how many times a waiter stopped by the table to check on my friend and I. Very hospitable.  This time, I ordered the Pad Khing (Ginger) rice platter which is stir fry vegetables with bell pepper, ginger, onions and snow peas. I got mine with no onions because I hate onions...lol. I think my friend Billie got the Pad Kra-Tiem Prik Thai (Garlic & Pepper) which according to the menu has \"Stir fry with garlic, bell pepper, snow peas, onions, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.\"  We both LOVED our meals. The flavour on mine was on point and very tasty. I will defintely be back.  Absoutely DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"Started the evening with Thai Iced Tea and Satay. Both were delicious the peanut sauce and cucumber relish that come with the Satay are amazing. The tea is a must have item. I ordered the Green Curry with beef spice level hot, my wife chose Pad Se-Ew spice level medium. We also ordered Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango this is a dessert item but I like to have it with the meal, cools the tongue and refreshes the pallet. All dishes cooked to perfection and spiced properly, the perfect balance of heat and sweet. Closing the meal we had Coconut Ice Cream and Thai Iced Coffee. Every aspect of the meal was perfect from preparation to service. This is a small non descript eatery easily passed over nestled in a strip mall. The family owned attention to customer service is a breath of fresh air. Decor is modest but adequate, if you are looking for fancy dining this is not the place. However if great food and fabulous service are your goal this is the place. The price point is spot on for the quantity and quality of all items served."}
{"text":"My friend recommended we should go here for lunch. Her and her boyfriend came here about 3 times had really good food.  We decided to try the lunch special yellow curry chicken. I ordered the Thai hot and she ordered the Medium Thai spicy.   The server told us this is the medium so that one to my friend and the hot went to me. My friend took a bit of her and hers was surprising really spicy. And mine didn't even have a bite. Come to find out that he accidentally gave us the wrong meal.   We were in a hurry so we just decided to switch plates instead of waiting for a new one.  The meal didn't have much chicken in it, it had lots of potatoes and carrots that came with a side of rice. I thought hey it's lunch I shouldn't eat too much anyways.  Half way through my meal my stomach felt upset. I finished my meal and instantly ran to the restroom.. I think you guys know what happened from there.   I ate at 1230pm and I've gone to the restroom about 10 or more times. FOOD POISONING!  Honestly, the food didn't taste bad at all. But apparently, my body rejected the food."}
{"text":"Hard to believe in this area you can find a decent Thai restaurant but believe it or not we actually have one!! The food is very good and priced accordingly, the wait is sometimes longer than people will like but that is the nature of the business when you have good food! You can eat inside or do take out, it doesn't have a huge sitting area, just about a dozen tables so if the wait is long for a table you can always grab take out."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3.5 if i could. This place is tiny and super simple with friendly staff. Their spring rolls are good, a bit oily for my taste though. Keang Panaeng was really good but Pad Thai was a definite miss. But overall, not disappointing. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this place since it has opened we have eaten there at least once a week. We are newbies when it comes to Thai food so I really have nothing to compare it to.  The people are friendly, the food is GOOD and the place is CLEAN!!! We have tried multiple menu items and have like them all so far!"}
{"text":"When I give a little joint 5 stars, I'm giving it 5 stars for what it is.    Thai kitchen is a teeny-tiny, cheap, awesome little Mom 'n' Pop joint that serves seriously amazing, freshly prepared food that tastes great at the tiny little tables, or as take away.  Mom cooks, Dad takes orders. The service is supremely polite and genial.  You can ask for the spicy dishes mild, medium or hot.  NB: no checks, no credit cards, BYOB.  I had a pork curry with ginger and pineapple.  The flavors sang.  The finely julienned ginger was fresh and crisp.  The sauce was vibrant and complex and the pork was tender.  Miss 6 Year Old Queen of Every Little Thing had the chicken Pad Thai which was tasty and not at all greasy.  Mon cher chou had the cashew chicken.  The chicken was very tender and the flavors were subtle and well balanced.  The real stand out were the summer rolls appetizer.  These are tender strips of chicken and whole shrimp, wrapped in mint leaves, lettuce and basil, then wrapped in a rice paper wrapping.  It is accompanied bu the ubiquitous sweet and spicy thai chili dipping sauce and a few peices of warmed pineapple.  No frying involved.  This would be the perfect summer lunch along with a bit of soup.  Nom.  So yeah, I'm sure there are fancier places that taste like you just spent one night in Bangkok, but for the money and the charm, Thai Kitchen deserves every one of its stars."}
{"text":"So I'll be honest about this place.  If you're expecting Banana Blossom ambiance, you won't find it here. If you expect fast service, you won't find it here.  What you will find, if you open your mind, is the best Thai food in the Cleveland area.  The Good: The food here is simply put, the best Thai food I've ever eaten.  I always get pad thai at a solid medium spice level.  Here, I ordered a level 5, and it is the perfect blend of heat and sweet. It's inexpensive, and the food arrives as if it is individually cooked in a home kitchen just for you. 5-stars  The Bad:  The food arrives like it is individually cooked in a home kitchen because it is.  Right in front of you for you to see the dirt, grime, and mess.  The decor is very cheap, with dust covering everything.  Our visit lasted 2 hours, with over an hour of wait time until the food was served.  Take out orders were consistently 20-30 minutes late, which happened the time we bought takeout as well.  I don't think I'll dine in again, because the scene is disturbing.  1-star  Overall, I'm giving a rating of 3 because the food is too good not to have again.  I just wish they would go into a new location so I could enjoy the atmosphere as much as the food."}
{"text":"Spicy Basil Thai Hot is the goods. Nice, chill ambiance. Small menu, but everything we've had has been very good!"}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences here at the restaurant so I can't give this place a five star review. The service here is always good so no complaints there. The food comes out fast and the staff is always attentive. The restaurant is a little small but its very clean and its never been so busy that it felt too crowded. I think people primarily get take out here. I ordered the Tom Yum soup and the thai basil chicken before here and both were great. I know not many people like Tom Yum soup because of the vinegary taste of it but its delicious in my opinion. I would recommend these two dishes if your going here. I however would not recommend the number 24. I forget the name but its chicken and veggies in a \"thai gravy\". The gravy was bland and a little too thick for my taste. The whole meal between the veggies and the amount of chicken in it was ok and the portion was pretty small compared to what I can get at other thai places for the same price. So check this place out but know its hit or miss."}
{"text":"My brother used to love this place when he lived on Newman. Back when he penned the song \"New Man on Newman\". He said that since the new owners came, they barely put veggies in the vegan dishes. I can't really speak on that and told him he needs to give it a try again because maybe they ran out of veggies that night. I have been coming here a lot more lately. THEY DO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS NOW! Like some dude once said \"Best Asian food in Birdtown!\"."}
{"text":"My friend and I had spent the entire day driving from Boston so we were very hungry and tired by the time we reached to Cleveland. I had searched online and this place had good reviews so we decided to come here for dinner. The food was alright-it wasn't incredibly amazing but it wasn't horrible either. We ordered the pad see ew (chicken and beef.) The service was nice and we received our food quickly. The reason for the one star rating is because we realized that we both got HORRIBLE food poisoning. Not sure if this just happened to be a one time thing for this restaurant but it was not fun to spend the night throwing up and paralyzed with abdominal pain the next day."}
{"text":"Just a FYI.  This restaurant changed ownership since this past summer.  The previous owners retired and returned to Thailand and the current restaurant is in my opinion the best restaurant in Cleveland.  Take it from someone who knows what good authentic Thai food is.  The food is delicious.  The prices are reasonable and match up to the prices at major metropolitan cities.  I've been to other Thai restaurants in the Cleveland area and they are way overpriced.  Some places are charging $15 a plate (we are talking Manhattan prices...I'm sure you know which restaurant I'm talking about)!!!!  Restaurants in LA and Chicago are charging 7-8 bucks a plate.  All the dishes are good...just ask them to make it \"Thai style\" and you are good to go.  If your dish isnt spicy enough, ask them for Thai peppers (whole peppers or a powder form).  This place only takes cash btw."}
{"text":"We ordered iced tea, iced coffee, pad Thai and yellow curry. The pad Thai is tooooooo salty and we need to drink plenty of water. I would like to come again because I like the environment. Next time i would ask hem to add less salt/soy sauce. The iced tea and iced coffee is sweet, not too bad."}
{"text":"whatever you do - DO NOT GO HERE - I don't want to wait in LINE for the best Thai in AZ.... and I get cranky when I'm hungry..... . Quick service and damn good food! . Very small cafe so call ahead if you have a group. .  Busy dinner rush can get pretty noisy."}
{"text":"Super good!!!! Have gone many times. I would have rated five stars only if they didn't rip you off for take out. As long as we are eating in, you will have a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I have a craving for Thai food, but rarely have I been so pleased! The coconut curry was delicious and the pad Thai was cooked to perfection. Seriously, this is the best pad Thai I've ever had.  Do yourself a favor and explore the exceptional menu! I know I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"When I lived farther in town I use to go to a lot of Thai restaurants and I never had the experience I had eating at this restaurant. I was actually excited to see there was a Thai place opening up closer to aj and signal butte area! What a shame though. Went to lunch w my mother. My pad Thai was sticky and clumpy. Strange, anyways, I ate it (not all of it) and ended up getting sick few hours later. My mother was smart enough to not eat her pad Thai and did not get sick. I will not be returning. I really wanted this to be a good location to eat instead of driving to the other side of Mesa, Scottsdale, oh well seemed to good to be true. Next time I'll go to in and out.."}
{"text":"This place really surprised me. Food was authentic, nothing sickeningly sweet...heat level 1-10...I think 6-7 is great. Ugh wish they had a place like this in Ann Arbor!   Ordered take out. Pad Thai, Green Curry w/Tofu, and Kitchen Herbs w/Chicken. Whooo spicy but it burned so good!"}
{"text":"Thai Kitchen is hands down my favorite restaurant in the Cleveland area. I literally crave it all the time. I could easily eat here every day, but I resist.   My go-to dish is the Masaman Curry level 4 spice. It's spicy, savory, rich, a little sweet, creamy - I could go on and on. I usually go back and forth between the crispy spring rolls and the Thai Kitchen Tom Yum. The soup is so good, the rolls so crispy and the sauce is better than any spring roll/egg roll sauce I've ever had.   I love all of the food so much that I just started asking Chef Kwan to surprise me. I have loved everything she has ever made me. She knows me by name and knows my preferences. She always hits a home run!  If you haven't eaten here yet, you are truly missing out. I know, that's what everyone says about their favorite restaurants. But I'm serious. Best Thai food I have ever had. Ever. Eat here now!"}
{"text":"The food at Thai kitchen was so good with great flavor. I had the Ginger Lover with Chicken and Tom Kha soup which was the best soup I have ever had! The staff there was kind and very attentive! I wish I had found this place sooner!"}
{"text":"Cannot get enough of the Coconut Curry Noodle Soup! I get level three spice--listen to the reviews, even the low spice levels are pretty spicy in my opinion.  Great customer service, all the servers are extremely knowledgeable about the good. I am presuming it is a family business.  I must say I was disappointed in the Pad Thai though."}
{"text":"I gave them two stars because the lady served us was very nice. I have to say this is the worst Thai food I've ever had in my life. I have not travelled to many areas in the world, but I tried Thai food in different cities in Australia, in Singapore, and different cities in this country,  I have never expected Thai food to be like this. The beef in all dishes we ordered are dry, chewy and flavorless; drunken noodle was more like \"kway teow\" without bean sprouts, and the shrimp in it was over-cooked; even \"Mama tom yum instant noodle\" is more tasty than the \"thai kitchen tom yum soup\".  If you have high expectation in Thai food as I do, don't come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"So excited a Thai place opened up close to home.  The decor is comfortable and cute, service is friendly and food is always fast and good.  We have been back more times than I can count since they opened."}
{"text":"The spring rolls were great and my papaya salad was tasty (Sweet Mango's is better, but Thai Kitchen's is still good). I got it with salty crab though, which I was overcharged for (server fixed it immediately)... It was a large shelled spider that I wasn't expecting. No crab meat for me. I'm going to chalk this up to my own ignorance. Overall, a good experience. Not the best Thai I've had, but good! (I'm a big fan of Ty Fun in Tremont)"}
{"text":"First time at Thai Kitchen, and can proclaim that this is a legitimate alternative to the pricier TyFun in Tremont.  I had the Pad See Ew, which I've been told is the true national noodle dish of Thailand (versus Pad Thai), and also the dish I usually order at a Thai restaurant to rate quality.  Thai Kitchen's Pad See Ew had a lot more gravy than I'm used to, and thinner noodles.  But otherwise, the flavors were on target (though a little underspiced) and the greens were fresh and not overcooked.  The portion was also extremely generous--plenty of leftovers.      This modest dive is run by a very friendly and attentive staff--upon whom you can jovially practice your Mandarin Chinese or Siamese (the Caucasian owner speaks both and has lived and travelled widely in Asia)."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better. We take all our out of town guests here and there's always something to please even the pickiest of eaters. The staff is excellent and the food is so good. We come here whenever we can. And all our guests request we take them back!"}
{"text":"Excellent thai food. I eat a lot so I have to get extras. I got khao rad na with extra veggies, chicken, and rice. It was delicious, but I could've done another of the same. Worth it for sure, but not enough food for me. It was $12.99 total.  Also, I'm not a big fan of really spicy foods, a little jalapeños are usually enough for me. I got spicy level 4 and it was really mellow. May go up to 6 next time.  I got carry out and the people there were fast, polite, and helpful. The guy on the phone was easy to understand, which is something I always worry about when calling Thai/Chinese restaurants.  If you are going to eat there, be aware that the place is VERY small."}
{"text":"Our experience was atrocious.  I have worked in a Thai restaurant before and I can not believe how some of these dishes were prepared and served.  Pad Thai: too much sugar and watered down sauce was used.  The Green Curry was too thick and dry.  It was also served on a PLATE.  Thai Curry goes into  a bowl, it should have a consistency similar to soup.    Our order came out at different times, by a large margin.  One person was able to finish off half of their dish before the other dish came out.  The Thai tea was a shame both in size and quality.  It was 70% half-n-half, it should be 50/50 and poured CAREFULLY over the ice to not mix the two.  Overall I should have walked out."}
{"text":"There is no other restaurant in the entire country that I have as much fondness for as Thai Kitchen. I dream of their curry, their fried rice has no right to be as good as it is, the desert is a mellow but delicious end to the meal. Best of all is the owner. She is sweet, kind, pure, and too good for this world. Eat at Thai kitchen!"}
{"text":"Choo Che dish was excellent.   Service friendly and made it an event to take my two kids out for dinner.  T  We even tried the durian dessert.   It was delicious and the famous odor was present enough to give us a whiff but not overpowering- the fruit was deliciously sweet and exotic.   Mind the warnings on the spice scale.   I usually order everything extra spicy.  I recommend 7-8 here.  The place seats 12 and does carryout."}
{"text":"This was our first time and we loved it!  The Pad Thai, Pad Se Iew, and Chicken lettuce wraps were phenomenal!!  We called it in and it was ready when we arrived for pickup.  Yum yum is all we can say!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Fresh food fast. I liked that they speak good English and understood what gluten-free means. They were very accommodating to our gluten intolerance and used a gluten-free soy sauce to prepare our meals. We will definitely make this our go-to Thai place!"}
{"text":"To be fair - I've had takeout from here and I LOVED it.   Then (dun, dun, dun...) we decided to eat in. It's small. Very small. That doesn't really scare me though. It was also filthy. We were seated right next to the kitchen doors and every time they walked in and out i saw the inside of the kitchen. Someone had sneakers underneath the sink with dirty socks sticking out of them. I saw rotten tomatoes sitting on the counter. Worse? They \"decorated\" with outdoor lattice above your head and fake flowers and colored lights. It looks like it hasn't been dusted since the place opened... it was literally caked with dust and grease. It made me lose my appetite before I even got my food.   The service was SLOW. It took an hour after ordering just to get our appetizers (spring rolls). Then about another 20 minutes to get our food. The boy had pad thai and I had green curry. Objectively, they were both good. But, I couldn't help but worry that I was getting food poisoning and wondering why I didn't leave an hour ago.   I don't think I can come back here. I have a mental block because it was so dirty. I'm not a health inspector... but I have a feeling if one visits, none of us will be back here."}
{"text":"The garlic eggplant is my favorite, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Also the mango sticky rice is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great family owned Thai restaurant. There isn't much seating inside, but it is very cozy and welcoming nonetheless. The prices are extremely reasonable, especially for Thai food and for the portion size... I ordered a Thai iced tea, fish cake appetizer and an entree and my bill was somehow only $17. This place would be great for lunch takeout or a casual dinner. I am happy to recommend this place and will definitely be back for more! Also, make sure you leave room for dessert :)"}
{"text":"I just enjoyed the most flavorful and scrumptious lunch. Considering the quality of food and service I am very surprised this place isn't packed! The staff was very pleasant and quick to serve, restaurant was impeccably clean, the elephant pillows are adorable. You can see the kitchen staff in the back prepping food and cleanliness and sanitation is superb which makes me confident I won't be experiencing an upset tummy later.   The thai iced tea is the best that I have had in over 4 years. The plates are beautiful and the food tasted so fresh. Perfect blend of spices and flavors! I highly recommend dining here. Food is underpriced considering the quality, you are getting more then what you pay for."}
