{"text":"The food was good. But it took forever to get our orders!!!. But overall still would go back there, just for the food"}
{"text":"Went twice to this restaurant. During the first time we were given French menus and had to wait for another table for them to order and take their menus and they were taking long. Also, there was no pizza which is one of the signature dishes. The service was very slow.  The second experience was even worse. The service was slow and bad. We were the first to be in the restaurant and were the last to get our food. The food came cold. The ambiance was weird, from well-known symphonies to radio station music and shows. It sounded like we were in the gas station across the street. There are some good dishes but it wasn't worth the bad service and weird ambiance.  Finally, this restaurant is defiantly overpriced."}
{"text":"If only I could give this place 0 stars!  - gummy gnocchi that looked like it came out of a plastic packet - bland sauces - place feel like a fake Italian restaurant  If you want delicious Italian - go to Venti in old Montreal"}
{"text":"This place has delicious Italian food and is BYOB.  It's a great place to go for large groups, but the service can be very slow.   The thin-crust pizzas and pastas are all great."}
{"text":"This restaurant has really good food! Had the risotto and it was delicious.  Very generous portions. My friends had shrimp & veg, penne, and cannelloni.  All were very well received.  The waiter came by often and gave very good service.  The only downside was that a party of about 40 came in after us and brought dozens of bottles of wine and got very loud. They were sitting across the room and got unpleasantly noisy.  Very disappointing.   This restaurant has a party room in the basement and should have been used."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner. Really enjoyed everything, from calamari apps, fungi pizza and house salad, all the way to dessert. Would come back whenever I visit Montreal.. (I came in from Toronto to visit family)."}
{"text":"The restaurant was beautiful and open and hit it's stride with plenty of people later in the night. Good to know is that you can bring your own wine here for no charge whatsoever! \"Free\" wine= happy people. Nice touch, Trattoria.   I went for the $10 extra to make an entrée include soup or salad, dessert with coffee or tea.  The minestrone soup was decent and it was appreciated that they didn't put in soggy noodles like so many restaurants do. I heard the salad was very nice.   For the main I got the gnocchi with a spicy rose sauce and spinach. I felt kind of bad asking but I asked for an extra dash of whatever vegetables they had and it was no problem! The gnocchi were a good deal firmer that I would have liked and the sauce had some good spice at first bite. I don't know if I just got used to it very quickly or what but I stopped noticing shortly after. Maybe not so spicy after all?   The server was very diligent serving our table of ten at the beginning. I must mention, I have quite a boisterous family and as the night went on I saw the server's patience wane. She just didn't want to be there any more and it was written all over her face with every serving and request after the appetizers came.   Dessert was a bit disappointing too. I LOVE crème brulée. This one came in a wide and shallow dish that looked so inviting, I squealed. But underneath the delicious crackling, the custard was piecey and running in the wrong places. Not the creamy goodness I was expecting.    It's sad that a couple things make this a more negative review because we really did have a great time at the restaurant. They accommodated the assorted taste buds and we all walked out very full!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was picked as a plan b, since we had difficulty finding a restaurant that would take in a group of 20. We were presented a table d'hôte at 35$. I believe the choices were two different pasta dishes(one in rose the other a type of alfredo sauce), a porcini mushroom pizza, a veal marsala and a risotto. I can't speak for the rest of the dishes, since I don't know of anyone at our table ordering them, but I can relate my own experience and that of the diners at my section of the table. Basically, generic, bland and overpriced. The cut focaccia flatbread with grated parmesan was good, but it's bread. The bruscetta was already soggy when we received it, but the flavors were well balanced enough to make it edible. Our chef's salad was soggy mixed greens with a wedge of tomato that did not look healthy (being winter in Montreal, I guess we get what we can). The real disappointment of the evening came with the mains. Between being served our salads (a good 45 minutes into our meal), I waited between 25 and 30 minutes for my main. I ordered the veal marsala. Seeing as I had waited this long for my plate,  I checked the temperature of the veal and found it to vary between an acceptable temperature to \"this is getting cold\". I have had veal marsala in many restaurants, and can even make a decent version of it myself. This was not veal marsala! I would call it \"veal in brown sauce\", as undepronounced as the flavors were. The veal was accompanied by three tiny wrinkled potatoes, a couple of slices of roasted yellow pepper, a slice of roasted eggplant and a balsamic coulis. Despite the mediocrity of my main, I feel I came out on top, because I saw the risotto. A few diners at our table had ordered it, expecting what you would expect, a nice flavorful risotto with a nice creamy texture. This, however, was described as \"mushy, bland, cream-of-wheat-ish\". From my perspective, it didn't look as if they had used arborio rice, or had used it it, but ignored the dish while it was cooking. I didn't ask to try it, so I went by the testimonial of my friend that it was not good. We ended with a coffee and a slither of a cheesecake with a couple of berries in the plate. Thoroughly disappointing to \"I'm never coming here again\" was the range of opinions about the meal. Regarding the service, everything was fine until the mains, but I think they were dealing with an out of control kitchen. Then everything just got slow and no waiter can to our table for a good 15 minutes (we were 20!). Finally, I do not like an in-bill service charge. I would like to be able to determine the tip for my meal myself, although I know that I would have probably given the same tip. Not because the service was great (it was adequate at best, and not very warm), but because I felt sorry for any waiter who chose to work in such a mediocre and pretentiously overpriced restaurant where, just because you use Italian naming in your menu, doesn't make it delicious or authentic by default. One tip for the chef (re: sous chef, re: cook), marsala sauce is supposed to have notes of actual marsala wine."}
{"text":"En ce se baladant sur Notre Dame, on s'est arrêtés  à La Trattoria. On a choisi une table d'hôte car je voulais goûter le menu. Alors j'ai choisi, une soupe cremeuse de choux-fleurs et pomme de terre, avec des focacias...une pizza prociutto garni de salade arugula au milieu relevee de sauce vinaigrette balsamique legerement sucré. En dessert, le tiramisu, que j'ai trouvé passable. C'etait bon mais sans plus...si je suis dans le coin je m'arrêterai volontiers mais je ne  me deplacerai pas juste pour cela. Le plus c'est un apportez-votre-vin donc c'est dommage on ne le savait pas a l'avance."}
{"text":"It was a family affair! My father's birthday! We were about 30 people. I was very happy that the restaurant provided parking spot. The service was nice; the waiters were very amiable. The food was average, when it came to the taste. As Italian restaurant, where you expect the greatest pizza and pasta, sadly it was bland. Service and amenities yippee! Food is just ok. The restaurant is very cozy. The decor is just average."}
{"text":"went there last night with friends and really enjoyed it. From the calamri to the veal scallopini, the service & price were very good."}
{"text":"Nice bring your own wine. Decent decor inside. Food is pretty good though some people think it is not the best. Waiter was entertaining but slow."}
{"text":"Came here with work for a retirement dinner. We had one of their \"private group rooms\". The food was great, a large and diversified selection. I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars taking in consideration that it is a low-medium budget, bring your own wine type of place (to compare with someplace like a Casa-Greque).  The food was great, the service was great. The waiters knew their menus, specials du jour and ingredients perfectly. It was what I expected from a small, inexpensive italian restaurant like this. The place is beautiful, great for groups and family. If you think this place is what it's not, then you'll give this  place a bad review."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's birthday.  Service was fast and staff was friendly.  The food was ok.  Not the best Italian food I've ever had.  A bit overpriced for what it is. They charged a corkage fee for the bottes as its BYOW and even charged it to a pregnant girl who didn't drink.  At the end they brought us a plate with complimentary desserts which was quite nice. At 11pm they turned the lights on and basically pushed us out.  Overall it was an average supper."}
{"text":"The food is not bad but a bit pricy for what you're getting. It is BYOW though so that does make the restaurant more appealing when deciding what to eat for girls night out."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've ever had during my 5 years in Montreal.    Arrived there a couple minutes before my reservation and was completely ignored by the entire staff for a good 10 minutes. Finally, after flagging down a waiter, was shown to a table. The rest of my dining party were also ignored by the staff upon arrival, until I saw them and asked them to be seated myself.   Were left with the menus for almost 45 minutes before going out of our way to call the staff to finally take down our orders. Felt like we were being a nuisance to them by having the audacity to dare place an order.   Food was mediocre at best, and very overpriced for the quality, service and time it took to prepare. Waiter came over to our table to tell us off for for talking with raised voices halfway into our meal, while another birthday party was screaming at the top of their lungs on the other side of the restaurant. I guess we weren't flirting with them so our business didn't matter nearly as much.   Finally got our bills and were again ignored for more than half an hour before we had to flag down another waiter to ask if we could pay. The staff turned up the lights and started glaring at us before even giving us the chance to settle our bills  I have dined in hundreds of restaurants across the globe, ranging from food courts to Cordon Bleu restaurants, poor to amazing service. Never have I ever come across such a terrible dining experience in that time. Definitely not worth the prices they charge for the average food and worse than crap service."}
{"text":"First off I was surprised this place scored such low grade from a few people, I went here last night and it was actually really good! I have been here before under new owners, this place now looks more modern and revamped. We took a calamari and bruschetta to start, before that they brought us home made focaccia it was delicious! The calamari were also great, the batter nice and light. There were 2 types of bruschetta on the plate, standard tomato  and  a goat cheese and roasted peppers, this one was amazing! The goat cheese compliments the roasted peppers perfectly.  My buddy took the pasta arabiatta and a prochutto and arugula pizza and I took a margarita pizza, the only flaw here was the pasta, arabiata supposed to be spicy and this wasn't, well not for me anyway. The pizza dough was perfect, nicely cooked with a little chew! That the way I love it!   For desert we tryed the Nutella panacotta , simply devine, I have no words  The service here is impeccable, our waiters name was Emile and he was very pleasant and did everything to make our dinner great!  Ps it's a bring your own wine!"}
{"text":"Dans le monde des \"apportez votre vin\", le choix de restaurants italiens est assez large. Celui-ci, pas trop loin de chez moi, nous a été suggéré par des amis qui voulaient y célébrer leurs fiançailles. On était une bonne vingtaine de personnes et on avait avec nous autant de bouteilles de vins que de personnes à table! J'imagine que pour un serveur, c'est pas le type de groupe le plus facile à servir. Pourtant, je n'aurais pas pu demander mieux. Même si je suis arrivée après que tout le monde ai commandé, mon repas est quand même arrivé en même temps. Deux autres invités sont arrivés un peu après moi, et presque le même scénario c'est produit. Je trouve ça impressionnant vu le nombre d'assiettes différentes qui ont été demandées. Le bouffe comme telle est correcte et j'aimerais y retourner pour essayer d'autres plats. Le prix aussi est pas mal raisonnable. Puis le serveur, il ressemble beaucoup, beaucoup, beaucoup à Hubert de Occupation Double, mais c'est pas lui. Il se le fait demander au moins 2 fois par jour ces temps-ci!"}
{"text":"This is my wife and i's absolute favorite restaurant.  The food is exceptional and the staff extremely helpful.    Perfect place for a romantic dinner, or a birthday that lasts just a little too long."}
