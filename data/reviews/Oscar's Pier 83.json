{"text":"We ordered the 2 fish combo and fish burrito. I found the best idem to be their cocktail sauce. Over priced. Small portions."}
{"text":"Soooooo good.  They need to open one at Bell Rd. & Loop 303.  Check it out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get seafood in the valley. Everything I've tried is a hit. Great po boy with big portions of shrimp/oysters. Clam strips, oysters, clam chowder all delish! Even my kids chx fingers were tasty. Staff is always friendly, it's nice & clean."}
{"text":"Holy mother of Cod, this is by far some of the best fish I have had here in Arizona. Fresh, beautifully cleaned, melts in your mouth after the initial wonderful crunch of the light, flavorful shell. We were very much pleasantly surprised; considering, for one, we live in Arizona of all places (doesn't exactly scream \"seafood\" to me), and that the shop itself is nothing too special. Just a modest little restaurant behind a CVS; super simple interior, you go up to a counter to order. Nothing crazy, so the food being that amazing was an absolutely delightful experience. Not to mention the staff was highly personable and efficient, even within a half an hour of their closing time; always super appreciated. Thank you for the outstanding meal!"}
{"text":"Came here with a groupon, and was very pleased with the food and service. I ordered broiled salmon and a few scallops on the side. Everything was delicious, although the scallops were fried and I would have preferred them broiled. I don't think the menu mentioned they were fried so be careful when ordering.  The food was very good quality considering the quickness in which they cooked it, and the service was superb."}
{"text":"Very good food! I had the fish taco and the seafood pasta. Delicious! The place was clean and the staff helpful & friendly.  There were a lot of people but service was fast.  Definitely a great place and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really good food reasonable price. Had all you can eat catfish and the breading on it was perfectly done and not too thick. We will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"I am a realtor and had a showing a few blocks from Oscars.  So afterwards I did a Yelp search and thought to myself, \"Hey...this could be good.\"  It had low dollar signs and 4 and a half stars so I figured it had to be a winner.  I was wrong.  Now I'll be honest.  I probably didnt order the right thing....although the guy taking my order acted like what I was ordering was off the charts.  It wasnt close.  I wanted something that wasnt fried so my selections were limited and they were all really expensive for a fast food \"Order at a counter\" kinda place.  I had the trout.  It came with a strange macaroni salad which I wouldn't touch if my life depended on it, but I am strange that way.  No other options were offered and I walked out $14 poorer and hungrier than when I arrived.    I would guess that the combo platters would have been more satisfying or even just the straight up fried cod with fries.  But I wasnt looking to feel like a walking grease pit on my way home so I wanted to stick with something fairly healthy.    Once again...with the reviews the way that they were I figured I'd give this place a shot even when I saw the menu.  I mean it seemed like it had to be awesome.  But what I ordered really left me unsatisfied.    I figured I'd at least head over to the yogurt place at the other end of the strip mall for dessert.  Darned if it wasn't out of business!  I think it just \"Wasn't my night...\"  Oh well!  So like I said...the two reasons I went there were a \"fail\"  I thought it was gonna be inexpensive and awesome.  Instead it was pricey and \"blah\".    I guess a fast food fish place in the desert is sort of a novelty anyway.  But it sure isnt worth going to again."}
{"text":"So looking forward to trying the fish & chips, couldn't have been more dissatisfied, the fish had absolutely no flavor, probably due to the fact that it was over cooked. My first and last time------ so disappointed."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and scoped out the place before I went in. Clean and efficient, good customer service. I ordered the two piece fish and chips. Pretty tasty. Portions were a little small, but did not disappoint me. Thanks"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips.  I also like the service, ... order at the counter (food and drinks including beer) and they bring the food to your table.  Inside and outside seating and the decoration on the walls makes for an interesting meal.  One of our favourites when we get to the West side."}
{"text":"Love love love this place food is amazing quick service. Lol eat it 4-5 times a week!!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a true gem! The best fish and chowder. The food is served hot and fresh. If you frequent nation fish food chains... You will be ashamed to say that you did after eating here. There are everyday specials and... All you can eat fish on Sundays. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great! Love their lunch specials. I'm particularly fond of the catfish sandwich and the fish tacos. French fries are definitely a plus. Condiment selection is also good, including a variety of hot sauces, tartar sauce, and chipotle sauce in addition to ketchup and vinegar for fries"}
{"text":"Loved the fish and chips.  The clam chowder with sourdough bread bowl was also delicious. Cole slaw was a little too sweet, but good if you like your cole slaw that way."}
{"text":"Great food! You order at the counter but the staff is nice. It's very casual and reasonable prices. I recommend very much. It is great for the family too! I hope you get to enjoy the food here. Please try this place for your own good!"}
{"text":"Fresh! Fresh! Fresh! Their food is so very fresh and tasty. Freshest crispy fish I've ever had.  Loved the crab cakes too. Very friendly staff and prompt service.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything was top notch   From the fish to the fries to the hush puppies and especially the tarter sauce."}
{"text":"Thought it would be really crowded for Good Friday and while there was a line, it moved quickly. After ordering, we maybe waited ten minutes for our to-go order. On the ride back to the hotel (we're from NJ) the car smelled SO good. The food did not disappoint and the portions were huge. I will definitely go back when I'm in AZ for spring training next year."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and the service is friendly and attentive.   The crab cakes are amazing, they use a good amount of crab and they are cooked to perfection.  The fish tacos are huge and taste great, they are battered just right so they are not to doughy and you can taste the fish.  They have a wide variety menu and everything we have had so far tastes great."}
{"text":"Born and raised in New England and this is definitely the best fish and chips in the valley. Crispy but not greasy. Good chips. A proper selection of condiments and while not really New England the hush puppies are a must.  Plus if you are feeling fancy they have catfish,  Mahi Mahi even Salmon or Halibut. Have not had the chowder or broiled fish yet but definitely going to try them soon"}
{"text":"Perfect fish and chips every time I go. Super nice people and fast service. The fish tacos are amazing! They even have little baggies to take a lemon wedge in the go. Great specials everyday!"}
{"text":"Really good, fresh food. Thick clam chowder with lots of clams. Try hush puppies substitute for coleslaw and steak fries instead of thin fries."}
{"text":"We used to go to Taylor's Chowder House for fish and chips, but after my family and I ate at Oscar's, we are hooked! The salmon is good, the fish and chips are great, and the hush puppies are to die for. The best item is definitely the clam chowder. The decor may be a bit lacking,but for the price and the flavor, it really can't be beat.  My family and I eat there every other week. These guys know what they're doing! For being in a landlocked state, there is no better place."}
{"text":"We've been trying local eateries rather than the chain restaurants.  We are so glad we found Pier 83!  Great fish tacos, and the kids meal portions are excellent!  One taco is plenty for a meal - two big pieces of golden fried Cod, shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, yummy sauce. Perfect!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Perfect experience every single time. Not only is this the best fish I've had in Arizona (Florida  native) the service is phenomenal,  prices are excellent and I've actually burned my fingers as my food came out so hot. I've never had a visit where a manager hasn't personally checked on me and the staff is equally as hospitable."}
{"text":"No place to sit, ordered 3 pieces of fish and coke and it was 12.00.  Too much for what i got which is basically fast food"}
{"text":"We walked into this place and thought we were about to experience a local, strip-mall version of Long John Silver's. But we were pleasantly surprised at the quality and variety of the menu offerings. I had the daily special, monchong, which I was told is a Hawaiian fish, along with a healthy portion of sauteed vegetables and some tasty seafood salad. Good stuff! My husband liked his cod-oyster combo but thought the coleslaw was a bit bland for his taste, although fresh and crisp. The staff were engaging, fun and helpful, which added to a pleasurable dining experience. This concept could go far if franchised!"}
{"text":"My better half discovered this little gem and it was a wonderful day for me when she shared it. Located in a strip mall this place has to have the best jumbo deep fried shrimp I have had since Puerto Vallarta. Fish and chips, cole slaw and much more. You can order by the individual piece or in meals to suit yourself. Friendly and clean. Nothing fancy but they take pride in their establishment and it shows."}
{"text":"The food was actually pretty good, but kind of pricey for what you get and the d√©cor is a little shabby. I think this would be more of a take-out place for me than a date night. I got the fried tilapia with fries and a drink for $15 ... a little rich I think for a couple pieces of fish."}
{"text":"Quick and fresh.  I like the shrimp tacos. Th ey are much larger than most tacos.  1 is just the right amount for lunch."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant today for the 1st time.  I had the Fish (Cod) Taco and my friend had the Catfish & Chips.  The fish at this place was the best fish I have had in Phoenix without going to a very expensive fish restaurant.  They had a great batter on the fish and it was cooked in clean oil.  I come from the Midwest where the catfish tastes like Mud.  Had a sample of this catfish and was surprised how good it tasted.  My friend loves catfish and said it was the best he has ever had.  He normally goes to Pete's and says it is OK.  Can't wait to revisit."}
{"text":"First time here since living in AZ since 2012. Decided to check out this cafe.  The reason I gave a 3 star because my catfish was mushy meat, no flavor and so greasy. I knew ahead I wanted catfish but just never thought it would be like this.  It was a huge portion though.  Plus the coleslaw was very good and tasty. Saved the 10% on the bill.  Came here with my friend Tom!  Plus Tom's meal was just fine."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with the food here. It's my favorite fish place, no question. I started out ordering fish and chips - very yummy, comes with their delicious coleslaw. One day I ordered the fried cod fish taco and OMG I can't seem to order anything else now. It's easily THE BEST fish taco I've ever had. The tortilla is grilled and holds up well. It's stuffed with cod, coleslaw, with a mild spicy sauce and a side of pico de gallo that you must pour into the top of the taco. Excellent! My son loves their clam chowder bread bowl - and I also love the chowder but I get a small cup to go with my taco. They also have really tasty hush puppies. The service is friendly and I can't wait to go back soon. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really Good Fish and Chips I had the Cod and the Shrimp was Great I will surely return for more. Good service also!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best Seafood place in the state of Arizona!  I love the Clam Chowder Bread bowl."}
{"text":"Sad that I didn't know about this place until after living in AZ for 3 years. This place has great fish and chips and an amazing daily special menu. Would recommend checking it out if you're craving fish for lunch! Very clean and laid back environment."}
{"text":"Since we found this little gem last spring, we have been going for lunch every couple of weeks.  If we lived closer, we would probably go more often.  I love their fried oysters. The fried shrimp are also excellent, as well as the cod. My husband loves the Po Boy sandwiches.  Food is prepared quickly and served piping hot. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you like fish and chips, this is the only place in Phx metro area I would ever take you to - always made super fresh to order, comes out piping hot, and has all the accoutrements: tarter sauce, malt vinegar, cocktail sauce, lemon, and as much as you want of them. My bf always eats way too much when we go here, and honestly so do I...no regrets. The hush puppies and clam chowder are great too!"}
{"text":"Good and healthy foods on the menu with reasonable prices. I tried the tuna sandwich and it was great."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Atmosphere was decent for a land locked seafood place. There is no mistaking what kind of food you would get.  I thought the food was just decent, very greasy and deep fried. I had the sample platter and probably would go for something more fresh next time.  Sauces were great, especially the chipotle sauce. A little pricy for lunch but overall it was an average experience."}
{"text":"Finally a great place in the Arrowhead area for fish n chips! This isnt no ordinary place..you have a choice of fish: Icelandic cod, Alaskan cod, Salmon, Tilapia, Haddock, Catfish. Plus many other menu items, Like soft shell crab,shrimp,scallops, calamari,oysters and clams. They also have hamburgers and chicken if someone in your group is not into seafood. Salads and taco's here as well. I always go for the fish and shrimp combo. The fish is moist on the inside and the light batter on the outside is crunchy. The shrimp by far are some of the best..BIG shrimp that are not all batter. Just a light coat and crunchy, yet not overcooked. I like the huspuppies there but you can use it as a substitute or buy them separate. The \"chips\" (fries) are just ok. Generic shoestring fries. But I can live with that. They have a great kids menu here as well. Friendly staff too. And the place is clean and tastefully decorated. Check out their website for coupons or specials. Lunch specials, and taco tuesday, monday madness on appetizers, and all u can eat fish sunday."}
{"text":"I Just recently came across this sea food place came in tonight on a Saturday night it was pretty full waited on a table for about less than 10 minutes so wasn't to bad  I went in with a few family members it was our first time we had the broiled salmon meal Amazing!!   the tacos where HUGE ..the clam chowder was a little to thick but overall food was amazing very clean environment the girl working the counter was on top of everything will definitely be back they offer outdoor seating to"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!  We are new to Arizona and really thought we'd have trouble finding a good place for fish.  Really common where we're from to have dozens of good places for battered fish.  Clean, reasonably priced and prompt service.  Food was served hot, and the fish was meaty, flaky and moist and was not all deep fried batter.  It's not far from where we live so we will definitely be back.  Someone else mentioned that the cod was bland and needed more seasoning, well cod is a mild tasting fish, I don't think you'd want a lot of seasoning."}
{"text":"I had the Mahi and husband had the cod. Both were ok. Liked the coleslaw a lot. Good tarter.  On the other side of town so probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We like coming to Oscars Pier 83 for a fish fry. I love their catfish. But they have a bunch of things on their menu to pick from. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"OMG! The best seafood we've tasted in a very long time.  We had the combo meal; 1 Piece Cod & 4 Jumbo Shrimp and it was sooooo good. Cod and shrimp were tempura style and very fresh.  The French fries and coleslaw that came with it was also good making for a very excellent meal.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I love, love, love their food.  In a strip mall, on the SE corner of Union Hills and 59th Ave., behind the Sonic and the CVS Drug Store, you will find some of the tastiest seafood in the valley.  Keep your eyes open as you walk in because they post short term specials on the glass door.  Step up to the counter, read the the menu on the wall, and feel your jaw drop at the variety on offer.  AND they are willing to do it your way.  For example, last time I was there, they turned the fried, soft shell crab special into a poor boy sandwich with ripe, sliced tomato, and a generous amount of lettuce.  The giant roll is soft, and grill/toasted on all sides. I got their house-made Louie sauce on the side since I love to dip into it.  Note, if you get the shrimp poor boy, it comes over flowing with shrimp.  You can add sides and additions to any meal or item.  I will get a piece of fried catfish (it's huge) and sweet potato fries and be stuffed.   After you order and pay (there is a customer reward program plus a 10% off app for your phone),  go to the back counter and get your fountain drink, (beer, wine and bottled drinks are available at the counter) Then pick your cocktail sauce, ketchup, lemons, napkins and plasticware. (Mayonnaise based tarter sauce and Louis dressing are delivered to your table with your food) Note: a large part of their service is take-out. Pick a table inside or out on the patio, and ENJOY."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter have been to this restaurant for a while. So they deserve a five star. It is very hard to find a good fish place in Arizona. It taste fresh, It look fresh. When they fried it. It isn't resting on a bed a grease. So for the one who like destroyed small businesses just because you are ignorant or think your voice matter and that make you feel important. Please understand that restaurant are human been and they are not machines so stop acting like little brat and have some tolerance. I glade the place is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love this place. Really good fish and chips. Their fish and shrimp tacos are amazing as well. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a casual Fish spot for a while now, tis fit the bill perfectly. My wife who I've been trying eat a fish taco forever LOVED them here, I thought they were good not great but the chipotle sauce was awesome and went with everything we had. We got a fish taco, shrimp po boy and calamari appetizer. The taco was good size and right mix of fish and cabbage, shrimp in po boy was good but bread was disappointing just ordinary bagged French roll not even toasted, loved the calamari app  should have gotten two orders and bounced the Po boy.  Will come back probably more of a 3.5 than a 3."}
{"text":"Let's not fool ourselves.  Seafood joints in landlocked states are always a dicey proposition.  Seafood joints in the middle of the desert seem almost insane.  Somehow though, there is one tucked away right here that can almost completely make you forget where you are.  Blink and you'll miss this restaurant, nestled in a strip center at the southeast corner of 59th Avenue and Union Hills.  The parking in front is insufficient, with two large handicapped spots and three regular spots full at almost all hours.  Other parking in the large parking lot is always available for those brave enough to walk fifty paces in the heat.  The restaurant itself is small and simple.  Not much more than a counter to order at, a self-serve beverage and condiment area, and about a dozen tables inside a clean and nautically-themed room.  The theme is cute without being over-the-top, there's even a picture of me in a sailor's hat on the wall if you look closely enough.  I had heard tell that the decor here was overpowering but found that not to be the case.  Perhaps it was toned down in recent months.  The staff here is friendly, there were two persons on duty at the late hour in which I stopped for dinner.  While going over the menu, the counter clerk made polite suggestions and even offered a substitution at no additional cost.  Let me just say that things like this are getting fewer and farther between as the Great Recession drags on.  I appreciated his suggestions and his help, and found that his offer to substitute something else in order to completely please a customer was a wonderful breath of fresh air.  I was feeling good about that when I took my seat, but feeling even better when the food arrived.  This place does not mess around.  Your battered items will be served to you piping hot with a perfect batter shell.  It isn't too light, it isn't too thick, it is just the way it should be and it tastes delicious.  They do not skimp with their fish, either.  You order something, you're going to get the full cut.  I found the shrimp cocktail to be among the best I have ever had, and couldn't believe I thought that.  As a longtime clam chowder aficionado, I had to try it here just to see where it stood.  My chowtime companion who hails from San Francisco (the home of clam chowder no matter what those silly chowda-swilling Bostonians say) and I were stunned to admit that the stuff here ranks right up there with the best of what is offered in seafaring towns.  I didn't want to admit that but I had to.  It was just that good.  The soup was thick without being syrupy, and flavorful without being explosive.  The bread bowl it was served in was nicely soft and tasty.  I would highly recommend this soup.  I was able to thoroughly enjoy seafood while staring at a cactus out the window.  For bending my mind that way, Pier 83 deserves a full five stars!"}
{"text":"Some of the best clam chowder I've ever had. East coast seafood served in Glendale Arizona. No disappointments at this place. Everyone loved the crab cakes and fried shrimp as well. Casual dining delicious seafood. They also serve beer and wine."}
{"text":"Excellent. Amazing quality and fast service with no detriment to the tastiness of food. Hot and fresh. Used to have amazing HUGE scallops but due to price of scallops they were discontinued. I actually appreciate that instead of them choosing to have them be so expensive everyone would lose. No disappointment here ever"}
{"text":"Locally owned and operated! Best fish in town as well as friendliest staff. Highly recommend trying this place out! Always busy during lunch time so you know it is good. Has food for non-fish eaters too :) come try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The sea food is prepared to make you smile when you take your first bite. Try it you'll like it!!"}
{"text":"Got fish and chips and nothing to complain about.  Wasn't the best seafood I've ever had but it was reasonable.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful, family-owned fish & chips restaurant. The fish is fresh, delicious and served with a smile.  We started with the calamari appetizer. They pound out their own calamari steaks, then cut them into strips. You can have this served with cocktail sauce, tartar sauce or their house made chipotle.   Catfish sandwhich served on fresh, house-made buns.   Jumbo fish taco made with delicious cod served with a very light, house made chipotle sauce and shredded cabbage."}
{"text":"I would have to say the food is pretty decent. They do have a good fish & chips and the clam chowder is above average. The biggest reason we don't go there much is because it can be tough to find a seat, which depending on perspective may not actually be a bad thing."}
{"text":"Fish you want to consume with relish (....or tartar sauce). Comfort seafood.Prices are doable . Pacific cod fish and chips are my go to (add a fried oyster or three and I'm ready to go see Elizabeth..we miss you Redd Foxx )  Fried fish is not super greasy and is crispy  goodness. Safe ,strip mall location with safe strip mall patronage.   Recommend this place if you want more fish than breading and  want to skip the high overhead costs of full service restaurant.  When it's busy, be prepared to wait in line for a few minutes to place your order"}
{"text":"Greatest mom and pop seafood place around. Most amazing chicken sandwich ever!!!!  If your looking for great seafood this is the place to go."}
{"text":"super delicious food and amazing service. Taco tuesdays are the best! =)"}
{"text":"OMG! The BEST shrimp PO-Boy I have ever had. I have had them in New Orleans and this is better!!! My husband and I checked them out based on the yelp reviews. This place did not disappoint!! If we could have eaten more we would have. We shared between us and our littles. We started with the clam chowder..SHUT UP! SOOO good. Yes we ate warm chowder in this AZ heat but was it worth it?? Um..YAASSS! We had a shrimp Po-Boy, hush puppies and a side salad.  The shrimp was perfectly light and fresh. Top with some hot sauce and the house \"tartar\" that comes with it and you are in southern heaven!! The bread was soft, yet toasty and had this amazing yeast flavor that I love in a good bread.  The hush puppies were full of flavor and our littles loved them!! The experience was far from disappointing!! We will DEFINITELY return!!"}
{"text":"First time we tried this place, not too far from Mid-western University. I had the cod with shrimp combo and really enjoyed it. Fish was fried with nice clean oil. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to Maui, thought we would get great sea food, we were wrong!  Better fish at Pier 83.  Could not wait to get home to eat there. The best fish tacos ever!"}
{"text":"Very good. Get the ultimate combo excellent to try a bit of everything. Great stuffed salmon, broiled halibit, and my 4 ya old loved the kids shrimp."}
{"text":"A great little seafood restaurant!  Very informal with a walk up ordering counter offering very tasty fish and chips and other seafood.  In addition to the inside tables an outdoor eating area is available.  Beer in bottles/cans and limited wine selection available.  Most selections served with skinny french fries and a creamy coleslaw.  Food all seemed to be freshly fried to order in a very light breading that did not mask the flavor of the fish was very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Just read all the reviews on Oscar's Pier 83 and decided that as Mainahs with a hankerin' for some haddock we'd give it a whirl.  Was shocked to find how close it was to where we live and that we've been driving past it all the time we were whining about how much we missed seafood!  We had the haddock fish and chips since haddock is hard to find anywhere around here.  It was great!  The fish and chips came with fries and coleslaw.  The coleslaw was excellent, the fries a little on the thin side for us.  The tartar sauce was a very nice flavor as well.  The gentleman at the counter was very welcoming and made some small talk with my husband about New England and being from Maine.  We will be back!  Cant wait to try the fish tacos, the shrimp and the broiled seafood options!  Eh-yup, it was \"some wicked good.\""}
{"text":"I feel I may have been a bit harsh in my first review. For somebody that rated this spot three stars, I find myself going often. I mean, a lot.  I enjoy the fish tacos and the shrimp prepared any way. Their shrimp cocktails, fried shrimp, shrimp tacos are all very good. The tacos actually come with a great tasting salsa and fresh, crunchy cabbage.  The staff has always been kind and accommodating.  High quality sea food is hard to find and Oscar's is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Impressed - first time... chowder was Xcellent,  thick and chunky.  Big tacos.... went there because of the 4.5 star rating it lives up to it.  Want to eat there again..."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I took the chance coming here because the fish and chips are some of the most delicious I've ever had! It's surprisingly atmospheric and the staff was very pleasant- it has the convinces of a fast food restaurant but the quality of the food is anything but! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First of all....you know it's going to be good when you Google \"the best fish and chips phoenix az\" and this is the first place it pulls up. I was craving f&c so we had to go and it did NOT disappoint.   I got the catfish and hub got the Icelandic. Big portions -- nice crunchy crust -- fries were delish -- looooove their coleslaw --the Jasmine tea is off the chain good.   You order at the counter and they bring it out in flash.  We will be returning...for sure..."}
{"text":"If you need a fish and chips fix in the desert this will work.  The clam chowdah was good, the fried oysters were good (if you like that kind of thing), the fried cod was good and the fries were tasty and not greasy.  In fact, nothing was greasy. Would this place warrant 4 stars on either coast?  Who knows if they'd even survive, but for the desert, it's a good enough place to get a fish fix."}
{"text":"Oscar's Pier 83 is very good Phoenix seafood. My only issue with the food is the seemingly lack of seasoning on the batter. It doesn't seem to matter what I get there, the batter is always bland. You can spice it up with tarter sauce, cocktail sauce or malt vinegar, but the food would be better with seasoning in the batter."}
{"text":"Great seafood restaurant in the west valley! Lots of different choices. Reasonably priced. Will come back for sure! Used their 10% off Yelp offer."}
{"text":"This place is great!  We have consistently had fresh, delicious fish meals there.  The fried shrimp taco is my favorite, along with their clam chowder.  They will occasionally have Seafood Soup, which is amazing.  And of course their fish-and-chips is great, although they seem to have changed it a bit in our most recent visits and it's a little smaller and less tasty.  My husband's \"go-to\" meal there is the salmon (always delicious) with vegetables.  Paired with a good selection of beers and it's a great meal.  Looking forward to sitting outside in cooler weather."}
{"text":"We live in Mesa, but wife had to see a specialist Doctor on 59th ave.  While waiting for her I found this place and we went for lunch.  I had the 3 piece Cod fish & chips, she had the calamari.  The fish was excellent and their cole slaw was perfect amount of vinegar and sugar - good portions too for the price.   A few pieces of the calamari were a bit chewy but overall very good.  We give it a 5 star and plan to be back.  I would like to try the clam chowder.   JGH"}
{"text":"This is the best fish place for the price, period.  It's a step up from Pete's, even though they really do great job for what they are; a fast food fish and chips place.  And of course, it's a step down from a place like McCormick and Schmick's, since they don't fly their fish in fresh twice daily.  But for the cost of one entr√©e there, I can feed my whole family, I don't have to worry about a tip, and there is no waiting for your waiter to take his time refilling your drinks either.  The portions here are extremely generous.  They have ton's of variety (where else can you get a soft-shelled crab dinner for 7 bucks?), even including a fresh and juicy  1/2 pound burger (you can blame my wife for that one).  Everything is hot and well executed.  The service is very friendly.  The restaurant itself is extremely clean inside, and they even have a nice little patio area if you choose to dine outside.    So if you are in the Arrowhead area and you want a great selection of seafood for reasonable prices, don't be discouraged by the sea of chain restaurants in every direction.  Just look a little further for Oscar's, all tucked away in the back of a strip mall.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good fish and chips restaurant . I've been to most all of the fish and chips in town, This is among the best. Fried shrimp are truly jumbo. Calamari is very tender. This is my third trip to Oscar\"s. Will be back on one of my trips to Phx."}
{"text":"I went there today for the first time with my husband and mom.  We were greeted upon walking in, which I appreciate. We walked right up to the register to order, but the restaurant was almost full. We ordered a combo that came with cod, jumbo shrimp, fries, and coleslaw. We also ordered a fried shrimp taco, a fried cod taco, a mahi-mahi taco, and clam chowder. The food came out nice and hot! Everything was awesome!! I think the most impressive part of the meal was that the portion size was good. They didn't skimp on the fish at all. The best tasting item in my opinion was the jumbo shrimp. There was a good ratio of batter to fish, and it was almost sweet tasting, not overly greasy. The second most impressive part was the clam chowder because you get nice bits of clam in it.  We will be back 100% for sure! So happy we tried this place!"}
{"text":"The fish and chips are very good. Great homemade clam chowder, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best seafood in the area!! Got the shrimp burrito and the didn't skimp with the avocado. Crab cakes are on point as well, overall a great atmosphere and even better food!"}
{"text":"Yup, definitely a winner.  My companion has dementia and getting her to eat is a constant uphill battle. I watched her put away more fried food in one sitting than I've seen her eat in months.   And I wish I'd gotten the name of the extraordinarily patient and kind young woman at the counter - she was sweet as we took a bit longer than typical to figure out our orders.  Next time I'm in Glendale and wanting fish & chips, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great Service, Great Staff!  Very Friendly  And the Best Fish in Chips I have ever had.  Affordable Prices and Fast Service.  I recommend to any fish lovers!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the d√©cor.  They are trying way too hard.  Now with that said, the fish and chips here are rather good.  I especially love the salmon fish and chips.  At around $10 a plate you could expect to leave decently full.  Every time I have been here I have not left disappointed."}
{"text":"First time there.... Will be back!! Was very pleased with the fresh fish, portions & prices!! Great help at the counter when ordering too!"}
{"text":"I hate fish.  That being said.  After after a trip to Evanston, Illinois and trying fish taco's my world changed a little bit.  I have tried them a few times around the valley and these are to die for.  They do have a kick (you've been warned).  My husband and daugher have gone several times now and some days are busier than others.  They do have a patio - but with the summer heat I wouldn't recommend it.  If it had shade & misters maybe it would be a little more inviting.  I do ancestry... Im pretty sure those pictures of ship captains around the resturant are dead realatives of Capt Ron... well the resemblance is uncanny just saying..."}
{"text":"OMG !! We would typically have to goto San Diego for seafood this good, but not anymore. We had the calamari, tilapia & shrimp tacos .   It was out of this world good.   The GM who took our order was extremely friendly and helpful.  We will definitely be back for more.   Oscars sets a very high bar. From now on this is our GoTo for seafood in NW phoenix, without a doubt."}
{"text":"Our first visit. Had the clam strips, good but a little dark. Fish and chips: absolutely outstanding as was the calamari. The calamari was cut in \"steak strips\" ...crispy on the outside soft and tender on the inside....worth coming here just for the calamari. The \"sauces\" are \"serve yourself\"...cocktail, ketsup, sriracha etc. Order at the counter, served at the table. Tuesday night and they were busy, busy...still gave quick service. Didn't do desert, they have a cooler with what appears to be a variety of nice (but not made on the premises) deserts. Two complete meals (fries coleslaw), & two sides of 1/4 lb clam strips. $31. Worth it, will return to try the crab cakes."}
{"text":"Random find by using yelp to look up close by restaurants.  This place is amazing. I had Icelandic cod with chips (fries). My other friend had the same and we also had a clam chowder in a bowl. The chips were crispy and not greasy. The fish was thick and fried in a light batter. Absolutely delicious. I even took a clam chowder bowl to go for my roomie. This is my new go to chippy.    The place has ample seating. Very clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Fish & Chips, then this should be your next stop ! I have lived in Glendale since 2002 and have tried many others. This place has the best fish in town. You should also try their Fried Calamari. The BEST I have ever tasted. Soft shell Crab and Fish Tacos are AWESOME also."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I ordered the all you can eat catfish.  The customer service was excellent as well as the food.  The catfish wasn't super fishy tasting as many tend to be.  Even my wife tasted it as stated she would eat it (she isn't a seafood lover at all).  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"2 words: Awe. Some.   Great fish & Chips, great Po' Boys, so far have loved everything I have tried."}
{"text":"yum....love the crispy fried cod and clam chowder......nothing fancy here, good food, great service...affordable...clean...inviting."}
{"text":"Visiting my folks and am in town from Los Angeles. This place is better than California Fish Grill. They are reasonably priced and the fish, veggies, and pasta salad (with shrimp!) are clean and healthy eats!  We ordered the clam chowder-- excellent and not salty. They clams are HUGE and the soup is not saturated with potatoes. The broiled haddock and cod are light, clean and not fishy at all and cooked perfectly. The fried clam strips are a great side dish and a nice contrast in mouth feel when eaten along with the broiled fish.   The staff and managers are incredibly kind and hospitable. This is a very comfortable place to eat. And, this place is extremely clean and the customers all did a good job of keeping the self-serve drink area clean and neat.  Also, the place does not smell fishy and does not have that 'oil in the air' smell that some seafood joints have.   We will be back as the portions are huge and healthy and were packed perfectly for our to go order.   Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Very good would highly recommend to anyone looking for good seafood and reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's not cheap, so don't expect Long John Silvers type of fare. They do offer, and have outstanding quality fried seafood, yes. They also have broiled fish as well. Great menu, offering a large variety of things such as shrimp, clams, oysters, etc. Do not let the strip mall dive vibe turn you off of this place. If you are craving super fresh, large portioned fish fry, you need to give this place a try.  Hint: the place gets super packed right around 6pm, so be prepared!"}
{"text":"The combo platter is a must try if you like a little bit of everything...also try the crab cakes ."}
{"text":"Love this place, wish I found it sooner! Always friendly and willing to answer questions about there food. And the flavors are on point! Very clean as well."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious!  Try the hush pupies, sweet potato fries with any of the fish dishes."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved the fresh fish! Amazing good food and the sour dough bread bowl was to die for! Probably one of the better sour doughs I've found in Phx. It's a little pricey but worth it in the end because the food is so good. The manager on hand was super friendly and accommodating he put the cherry on top for the all over good review because he made us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good local seafood place, found this the other day on Yelp figured I'd get away from Petes fish and chips. A little hard to find, but once you do it will not be disappointing! Once you walk in you get that instance beach feel, staff was very friendly and made some great recommendations! I had the Mahi-Mahi fish and chips plate, the fish tasted really fresh and had a very thin layer of batter, (which I love) but what got my most of all was that it wasn't greasy at all! I will defiantly be back to try the clam chowder!"}
{"text":"My brother and I and the wives  found this place on yelp and it was amazing! This is the first place I have found in Arizona with top notch clam chowder. The chowder was in a yummy bread bowl and it was as fresh as it gets. Additionally, we ordered the shrimp tacos. They were also great with a nice crunch from the topped cabbage and tomatoes. The wife says the sauce on the fish tacos was superb. My brother ordered the fish and chips with a combination of cod and mahi mahi.  This was also very delicious and fresh. The fish was crunchy and not greasy. About the only thing we forgot on the trip was to order hush puppies.  If you are in search for great seafood come to this place. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED! We have been here several times...have always enjoyed it and that is why we return. MONDAY IS CLEARLY NOT THE DAY TO GO!! We noticed none of the regular staff were there. We should of ran!! I'm now just wondering if these are the new folks running the place??? If so I'll never go back!! Food was dry and over cooked, the place was dirty and trash flowing over! Yuk!!! What just happened?"}
{"text":"My favorite fish and chips in The Valley and my single favorite takeout near home. Located next to a decent sub shop and greasy fast burger drive thru so you can have a killer meal and still please the whole fam damily if needed.  Great food starting with outstanding ingredients. Perfectly prepared. Timed down to the minute when I call ahead for takeout so that it is still too hot to eat when I get it home."}
{"text":"Yum... they have a crazy amount of options on the menu, and everything was crispy, hot, and done perfectly. Portions are super generous as well. It was a little crowded when we came in, but it's pretty clear why and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. I would rate it 3.5 stars if I could. Not enough indoor seating for a place that offers all you can eat meals because people take longer to eat. Went for lunch on a Sun. and it was packed. No open seats so we ordered it to go but ended up getting a seat right before our food was done. Ordered fried cod and husband ordered broiled cod. Waited awhile for food but it was piping hot and fresh. Fried cod was good, but I would have liked it more with a bit more flavor or seasoning. Pieces were nice size and thick. Cole slaw was great, and fries were ok. Would try the steak fries next time. Hubby liked his broiled cod (I thought it was bland). It came with veggies and seafood pasta salad, which he said was awesome. I would try it again and get something different next time. I would recommend others try it."}
{"text":"A fantastic local restaurant that does everything right!  I have enjoyed many meals there with the same result---leaving full and totally satisfied. The menu is fairly straightforward with a good selection of items.  I find the fish hot, fresh and flavorful.  Try the fried cod and fried clams combo--comes with fries and a delicious side of coleslaw- the best in town!!! Tuesday fish taco special is equally great! The only downside is the lack of parking in the front lot. United Blood Services is located in the shopping center and is usually very busy...I suggest you park behind the restaurant..."}
{"text":"First time here and the staff is amazing as well as the owner - super friendly and GREAT service. I think that's very important in a company l. The food was the best seafood I've had! Definitely coming back. :)"}
{"text":"Went with a couple of friends,  fast and friendly service and great food. The ambiance is more of a fast food restaurant. Their tacos (fish/shrimp) were pretty good, but too much cabbage and only flour tortillas (corn tastes better with seafood in my opinion). Their fish and chips are pretty great though. Everything came out hot and fresh. If you're craving deep fried seafood, definitely give this place a try! I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"For a fish place they have great chicken tenders and chicken sandwichs. Alittle pricey but still good food."}
{"text":"I have to say I think I just chose poorly.   If you eat here do NOT get a shrimp burrito.   It is more than half cabbage with a few shrimp and a couple pieces of avocado for $10!!  When I complained and asked for something else, the rude little girl behind the counter rolled her eyes at me, pointed to the menu and said it was served as described.  She said there was nothing wrong with it and refused to refund or replace my meal.  I think the help here could use an education in customer service!  The clam chowder was decent, my husband's oyster po boy was good,  but the customer service was terrible!!  Not a great first experience, not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Food was good but expensive. Not a full service restaurant, not what we expected. Will not go back"}
{"text":"The quality has only improved,  and the staff is as friendly as ever. Well done, plus the 10% off coupons come in handy!"}
{"text":"Everything in this place is wonderful.  We never ever visit the Glendale, Az area without a stop in for the fried prawns.  The very best in the WORLD and I am not kidding.   The people that own the place are so organized and together.  The place is spotless and only as long as it takes a table to finish is someone there wiping it down.  I wish I could give this place a 100 for food quality, taste and value.   Awesome to say the least"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Had their Shrimp Louie salad and god-awful frozen shrimp on top. The shrimp was water-logged and \"leaked\" when I bit into them. For $9.99 I'll take frozen shrimp in landlocked AZ but bordering on freezer burn? Come on. Maybe they're better at deep fried dishes."}
{"text":"Ok, I was really expecting more from this place . I ordered cod , it came out crisp, with a bunch of grease at the bottom. I got one small container of tarter sauce... I asked for extra. The clam chowder ..ave at best . I would take pappadeaux any day over theirs. The coleslaw ... Room temp. Salad fresh, but not enough dressing. I see they have po boys next time I will try them."}
{"text":"Great place for sea food. Only place I will go to for sea food in Phoenix, AZ.  I only order Oscars ultimate combo with a little bit of everything. Fish, chicken, oyster, shrimp, fried clam strips, fries, coke slaw, and calamari. It's a great assortment of sea food.   Great customer service.  Clean restaurant.  Great food."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! First time here and the food was delicious. The batter was light and not greasy. We had te sandwich, the bread was a great combination to the fish. The fries were crispy and very good. Calamari was huge and Delish. Customer service was friendly and we felt very welcome. We will be coming back and bringing the whole family."}
{"text":"We just moved to this part of Glendale and had read the reviews so decided to try it . I must say the prices and fish are pretty damn good. We will be back often as we now live down the street ."}
{"text":"Solid meal, the Pacific Coast fish & chips are quite good. The calamari appetizer was the best. They served a dipping sauce that seemed like a spicy ranch that is the perfect complement to the calamari. Decor is good, restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"After reading the raving reviews, I was ready to share a birthday dinner with my husband. He ordered the special and I had the clam chowder that I heard so much about. The atmosphere is fun with lots of personal pictures. The service is friendly and welcoming. Even though you order at the counter, our meals were delivered to our table. Although the food was nice, we didn't feel that it was a place we will be frequenting again. We continue to search for a good seafood restaurant in the desert (maybe an oxymoron)."}
{"text":"Great fried seafood, the shrimp are jumbo and the oysters are perfectly cooked. Halibut and the cod atree my fish of choice. The clam chowder though has a lot to be corrected. New England clam chowder is not pasty and also the broth should be from the clams liquor, in addition it needs proper seasoning. Other than that they are quick with the orders.very polite staff."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best fish and chip places I've ever experienced.  Kind of mad at myself because we've lived by here for years and well only started going a few months ago.  I'm always looking for a good value when eating out.  This place is on the $$$ for fish and chips, but the value is in the freshness and quality so I don't mind paying the premium.  Service is terrific.  The staff is friendly and they really know their menu.  I guess if I had to make a suggestion the dining room could use some modernization."}
{"text":"Great food. The salmon is fantastic. Fish & chips are excellent. We will definitely add Oscar's to our favorites list."}
{"text":"Place is good. If you want some good fish tacos I would consider this place! It's quite but it's nice the variety of drinks is nice too. The workers look like they don't wanna be there but it doesn't bother me. I would consider this place if you want something different but good!"}
{"text":"Food always comes out hot. Fish and chips are delicious. Never smells fishy which is a good sign that the fish is fresh. We love this place."}
{"text":"Love the salads. Wow, the fried shrimp is excellent, lightly breaded and they tasted so fresh. This is a small independently owned neighborhood restaurant serving great food. Oh, try the little bundt cakes, strawberry is my fave!"}
{"text":"This is our new fried Seafood place in this part of town. It was the fried Oysters that got my attention. The prices here are reasonable and the food is fresh and tasty. They even have an all you can eat fried fish special that is worth checking out.  Inside is decorated with a fishing theme and there are several cool photos on the wall. Just go up and place your order and pick out a table. The condiment bar is really groovy and has one of those nifty fork dispensers. There is also a nice selection of hot sauces and even malt vinegar.  Started with a Oscar's Ultimate Combo with a side of Soft Shell Crab to get my feet wet. It is a deep fried Captain's dish with a little bit of everything. So good I brought my wife back for a Sunday throw down. She ordered the 2 pc Cod plate with fries and coleslaw. Yours truly went with some Cod, Oysters and Catfish. It was simply delightful.  They also have Salads, Sandwiches, Burritos, Tacos, and so on. Burgers and Chicken for you land lovers. Some of the items can also be broiled instead of deep fried. This is not a fancy Scottsdale restaurant. Just good food with a nice casual vibe. There was football playing on our last visit.  Excellent service and a very clean restaurant. We both agreed we would be returning sooner than later. Can't wait to try out some of their homemade Clam Chowder and possibly an Oyster Po-boy or a Giant Catfish Sandwich. DEEP FRY ME BABY!  4.75 STARS"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great staff and superb food. Catfish is so flaky and large portions. Slightly expensive but when it comes to seafood, you get what you pay for and I don't mind spending a little more for quality seafood. Chipotle ranch is amazing with everything! Definitely a go to place."}
{"text":"I must say the food is pretty decent. Arizona is not known for fish but this place definitely has my vote. I got Oscar's Ultimate Combo Meal and it filled me up which isn't normal when it comes to meals. This was my first time eating here, so this was the perfect meal to try out the menu. It had clams, oyster, chicken strip, calamari, shrimp and cod with a side of coleslaw. The cod was just okay and the oyster had a slight ocean flavor (but I don't like oysters). The rest was great and would definitely order the calamari and clams again as they were my favorite."}
{"text":"Pier 83 is the perfect place to go on a rainy night! Their clam chowder is better than any I have ever tasted and that includes some Alaskan restaurants that boasted having the best in the world. It's thick and creamy as you would expect, but they also know that people want some substance to their soups and so you'll also find nice silver dollar sized chunks of potatoes in your cup ($3.50/cup during Monday Madness) But who wants just a cup of this delicious goodness?! I suggest living a little and going for the sourdough bread bowl. If chowder's not your thing, you can't go wrong with anything else on the menu. Want something on the lighter side? The clam strips are tasty and their side salads are made with beautiful green leaf lettuce rather than iceberg."}
{"text":"Great place had the soft Shell crab sandwich and it was great also had the fish and chips it was also fantastic good place to eat if you love seafood"}
{"text":"Tip: 10% Off with Yelp Check-In!  Great fish and chips, terrific clam chowder! After searching for a fish 'n chips place for three years, I have found a place that I will come back to. Why?  Friendly service. The guys serving behind the counter are enthusiastic about their product. They were so helpful in helping us place our order. They have different discount specials daily. For Saturday, it was a dollar off sides. We got an order of hushpuppies ($1.99) for $1. You can't beat that.  Fish 'n Chips. They offer a variety of fish: Icelandic Cod, Haddock, Mahi-Mahi, Tilapia, Catfish and Salmon. Hubby got the 2 Cod combo. I got 1 Cod and clams. They came also with fries, Cole Slaw. Fresh tasting cod, firm texture, nice and flaky. The batter wasn't super flavorful, but it highlighted the sweetness of the fish. I am a fan of their tartar sauce. I usually don't care for it but it was tangy. They also have a 1000 Island style house sauce that I didn't like as much, but my son did. The clams were standard tasting clam strips, lightly coated, not over salted. They were good-sized clam strips. At the condiment counter, they have kick-ass cocktail sauce, rich with horseradish. Yum! They also have Heinz malt vinegar, Sriracha Hot Sauce, Louisiana Red Hot sauce, salt and pepper at the table. The Cole Slaw was tasty, too, not swimming in mayo.  Our highlight was the clam chowder. Have I had better? Yeah, but at a fancy restaurant in Portland in 1988. It was thick, tasty and, satisfying and came in a generous cup for $3.50. Bowls are $6.50. You could also get the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl for $9.99. My cup came with Zesty oyster crackers.  Will we be back? You betcha! Thank you, Norm R. for your review. I got the clam chowder because of you."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp Poorboy and it was the bomb! The bread taste like it was just baked & it was loaded with shrimp. A defiant must try & I can't wait to try other selections on the menu."}
{"text":"Found this place through a Groupon they did and I love it. Hard to find good seafood at a affordable price. Been back a bunch more times and never leave unhappy. Prices are good and seafood is great. Dont miss this one."}
{"text":"First time...and I will be back. I'm almost disappointed in myself for seeing this place come up in my Yelp searches before and deciding to go somewhere else. Shame on me for sticking to \"what I know.\" My boyfriend and I have lived right around the corner for the last two years, and have been neglecting this gem. We looked over the menu before we arrived because we knew we'd be standing at the counter, trying to make a decision otherwise. We ordered the combo basket to get a little bit of everything and a cod taco to round out our experience. Everything was perfect. I'm a sucker for seafood but I hate the \"fishy\" smell/taste or that \"over-priced seafood restaurant\" experience and you won't find either one of those things here."}
{"text":"We've been to this place a few times, my husband loves the oyster po' boy and I usually get hush puppies and some jumbo shrimp and fries. Tonight however, I wasn't feeling well so my husband went to pickup the order and bring it home and that must be where we made our mistake. We normally go there to eat and everything is good, but tonight, my meal was not so good. He ordered me the combo, 1 cod filet and 4 jumbo shrimp which also comes with Cole slaw and fries which costs $12.99. When I opened the box, I did not see a meal worth that price! Not sure if it's because we got it to go or what, but I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing. Simply amazing, I Iove the food here. I remember eating here about 3 yrs. ago and it's still just as great as the first time I tried it. The employees are sweet, the food comes quickly, and best of all the food is fresh and delicious. It's a cute little place and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any seafood lovers. They have many different types of fish and also a little bit of chicken as well if you're somehow not there for fish. And a side note, their French Fries aren't soggy! (Thank the heavens.) Give the place a try!:)"}
{"text":"My partner and I split Oscar's Ultimate Combo, which includes 2 jumbo shrimp, 2 calamari strips, 2 pieces cod, 1/4 pound fried clam strips served with fries and coleslaw.  In other words, the Ultimate Combo is big enough to share! My partner was an employee several years ago, so I trusted his menu expertise and was quite pleased at how fresh and clean tasting our meal turned out! The shrimp and cod were juicy, and they have a solid collection of cocktail dips and such. Make sure to check out their daily specials!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously!!!! I can't deal with how AMAZING this place is!   1) The customer service is phenomenal! The gentleman that took our order was great. He suggested menu items that were delicious. He made sure we were taken care of start to finish. There were many other customers as we came around lunch time on Black Friday, not once did his customer service change. He stayed on his \"A game\" the entire time. I haven't had this type of customer service ever in a restaurant! That alone sold me to eat here.  2) The food. To die for!! We ordered their Oscar's Ultimate Combo, a Mahi Mahi Taco, and the Jumbo Shrimp Combo. Everything was fresh and hot, meaning it wasn't done till we ordered it. By the time we got our drinks some condiments and sat down our food came right after us. Perfect timing!   This is by far the best place I've been to. We traveled all the way from west of the 303 fwy because of the reviews. It's obvious that this is the spot to satisfy your sea food cravings.   100% satisfied."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and always consistent.  The staff is friendly  and this restaurant also carries delicious desserts.  One of my favorite spots to eat. You have to try the jumbo shrimp! Will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  The people are so nice there and the food is insanely good!  My family and I were in there yesterday (us and our 2 kiddos) and ordered 2 of each kind of taco (8 total), all fried, and almost ate all of them!  These tacos are huge too so you're actually getting what you paid for, big bonus!  I'd recommend this place to anyone, so happy my friend showed it to me, another satisfying visit to Oscar's Pier 83!"}
{"text":"Looking for a restaurant that had fish and chips, my husband came across Oscar's Pier 83. He had the mahi mahi and I had their tilapia special. The fish was tasty and the service was great. We will definitely be back. Very impressed with how quickly they took the orders and delivered the food! Staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Gosh, this place is awesome! Their fish n chips are my go to. I like that you can substitute sides. I'm not the biggest fan of cole slaw and was able to get veggies. They have a good selection of items on the menu. They have two large screens showing it off. Once you order they will give you a number and you can sit where ever you want. When your food is ready they will bring it right to you. That is some good service there.  Everyone that works here is so nice and helpful. They really know there stuff.   This is a nice area the restaurant is in too. While there isn't any parking in front of the restaurant the parking lot is very large and you won't need to walk far.  If you are craving some fish this place is amazing. Definitely hit it up."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in town order the Mahimahi it is a 10"}
{"text":"Excellent food, everything I have tried is very good. The broiled salmon plate or Cod are my favorites."}
{"text":"Great location with inside and patio seating.  The employees are very friendly and helpful.  Very busy but everyone is extremely efficient. We ordered the cod and shrimp and sat outside. The prices are very reasonable and they offer beer and wine. The food was amazing! Absolutely delicious. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"great food and great customer service. never disappoints. Try taco tuesday"}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood fish restaurant with wild caught selections. The coleslaw was delicious and so were the French fries. Not a large dining room but they do a big Carry out business."}
{"text":"Had the Cod strips, jumbo shrimp and the calamari and it was great! Best calamari in the valley and we'll be going back to try the rest of the menu!  A bit pricey tho."}
{"text":"3 piece tilapia- very good, crispy and not greasy. Hush puppies were great!  Worth the drive, we'll be back for the jumbo shrimp taco."}
{"text":"The soft shell crab was really tasty but that is where it stops. The chipotle sauce that they provided for the po-boy and the crab tasted more like hidden valley ranch w/ paprika mixed in and the sandwich itself was just okay."}
{"text":"When people feel a cold coming, they pop a zinc lozenge or tablet to boost the immune system. I have a much better way to get my zinc supplementation: I head over to Pier 83 for their terrific fried oysters. With the first crunchy bite I begin to feel so much better. Placebo effect, probably. But hey ... as long as I get that feel-good boost, I don't care. The fish and chips are also the best I've had in the Valley. And to think that I've previously been trying to get my fish 'n chips fix from the likes of Pete's ... yikes! And their clam chowder is delicious; I don't need to feel under the weather to have an excuse for ordering this tasty bowl of comfort. The friendly staff and comfortable informal atmosphere complete the enticement for many return visits."}
{"text":"I've gone here many times and have really liked the place.  The fish is good and the customer service is always good.  The owner has been there at times when I've gone in and he has always been incredibly nice and even would remember my dad and myself orders that we normally get."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place been in search for five years since we left CA for a great fish and chip place.  Cole slaw was out of this world.  Everything was wonderful and prices were reasonable.  We live over an hour away but will be returning often.  Thank you for a great lunch."}
{"text":"So far the best seafood I've had in Phoenix/Glendale. Had the the best Clam chowder and really good Mahi-Mahi grilled fish tacos. Went with a family member who had the fish and some Colossal Shrimp. The guy who took our order was very nice and came over to ask how the food was. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"We have been many times since we wrote that first review, but went last week and they raised the price $4.00 on the meal I described! And the amount received was less! I guess prices go up everywhere but will be looking for alternative seafood, elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!!! The food is amazing and the people make you want to keep coming back. And come back we have!! My husband's favorite is the shrimp burrito. This is definitely our go-to place. You won't regret trying it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Three words:  Crab Stuffed Salmon.    Now that I have your attention, please kindly direct your gaze upon an otherwise non-descript strip center in the west valley.  On the southeast corner of 59th Ave and Union Hills lies Oscar's.  It's small restaurant with an interior that somewhat closely resembles a seafood shack setup you'd expect to find along the shores of New England.  Simple wooden seating, photos and fishing emblems all over the walls, and oh yeah, dynamite seafood.  I had been looking for a new lunch spot to try during the work day and it just so happens Yelpers were giving this place solid marks for the food and especially for Ron, the owner.  When I walked in this time, sure enough Ron was manning the register.  Super nice guy who is super passionate about his product.  Based on my experience it's easy to see why.  When you come in, you order at the counter and grab a table as they bring the food out to you.  The place looks like it seats about 40-50 people including the outdoor patio.  Be warned, the menu is lengthy with a ton of different items to choose from.  Ron can recommend items depending on your taste.  And if you're a regular, chances are Ron remembers what you like as he was naming off customer's favorite dishes in succession.  The place was about half full the whole time I was there with people steadily streaming in and out.  I just got a small table near the register since it was just me by myself this time.  I had done my research in advance and decided to go with one of their big feature dishes.  A crab stuffed salmon dish with sides of crab pasta salad and mixed veggies.  They have a 10% Yelp check in discount you can apply to your meal.  Total price for the meal plus drink after the discount was about $17.  My meal came out in about 10 minutes.  I believe most of their dishes take less time, but mine is probably among the more complex on their menu.  Ron enthusiastically brought it out to my table.  Looked and smelled heavenly (see my photo).  First off, let me praise Ron on the crab pasta salad.  They did not skimp on the crab with this.  I was able to get my fork on nice big chunks of rich crab (and even some shrimp) with every bite.  The cooked veggies were prepared very simple.  A little salt and pepper and include green beans, squash, and zucchini.  And of course, the main event.  The salmon.  A nice fillet with a line of crab stuffed in the middle from top to bottom.  Fantastic texture mixing the gentle subtle flavor of the salmon with the richness of the crab.  Seriously, I think this might be the best way I've ever seen salmon presented.  I pretty much crushed my meal in record time.  I was plenty full and happy when all was said and done.  As I mentioned earlier, most of their dishes come out pretty quick and the prices for most of their dishes looked to be around $10.  They also have specials on a regular basis (today they had a grilled swordfish special).  They also have a decent selection of beers and wines to choose from at the front (as well as plenty of soft drink choices).  This place would definitely work as a lunch or dinner spot for sure.  Big time props to you Ron.  You hit it out of the park on my first visit here.  It certainly won't be my last, though it might take me awhile to try everything on the menu.  Or I might just dominate that salmon again.  Either way it's a win-win."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and all I can say Wow! The food came piping hot and really fresh. I had the platter with a little bit of everything. Not being a calamari fan I was surprised it was amazing and the food wasn't at all greasy. We would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at Oscar's Pier 83 more than a half dozen times this year alone, and every time the service is great, the food even better. Whether it's their Shrimp Louie Salad, or their Fish and Chips, Oscar's Pier 83 delivers consistent good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Ooh wee. This place was good. The service was outstanding. Manager dude was a class act. Atmosphere was comfortable.  Went for the fish fry on Friday. I got more than my money's worth. The fish was hot fresh and tasted amazing. Only thing was the catfish was battered and I'm used to cornmeal breaded catfish.  Nonetheless they made it taste good. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I running some errands and saw Pier 83. I love fish and can eat it everyday of I can. The place was not fancy but clean. I don't care about fancy. I ordered the cod and clam strips. Decided on the seafood pasta in place of the fries. A cup of chowder and a drink. $21 and change, pretty expensive but I don't mind if it's good. I get my meal and I was like...I paid $21 for this? That piece of cod was 2 bites, 1 bite if I was a man. The clam strips quantity were ok.  Took a bite and man was I disappointed. Not a hint of spice. No salt, pepper or anything. The breading was so thick you couldn't taste the fish or clams. I'm one that does not add anything to the meal, no sauces either. I had to drench the clams with lemon and sprinkle salt to be able to eat it. What made it even worse, I can't get over this, the SEAFOOD pasta salad 2 pieces of crab...IMITATION CRAB at that. I've never had IMITATION crab in a seafood restaurant. Oh I was angry. Next time I want fast food seafood I'm going to Long John Silver, and for a nice sit down to Pappadeaux. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I got the fish and shrimp combo. I love how the fish and shrimp are lightly coated with batter! So fresh!"}
{"text":"I went here today. The food was good. I had fish tacos. The service was rude. Edit: I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because I did like the tacos."}
{"text":"Delicious fish tacos and incredibly good cole slaw. Fries are remarkably tasty, too. Great special on Taco Tuesday. I am tempted to go five stars, but the restaurant lacks ambiance, and I've twice noticed the same employee doing a very lackluster \"cleaning\" around the beverage island."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Friday night with two friends that recommended the place.  Chowder - Excellent. Thick and creamy base with lots of clam bits and the right amount of veggies. Not filled with potatoes like others I have had.  Fish - Excellent. Crisp batter crust in the right proportions. More fish than crust. But just enough crust to absorb the malt vinegar that I like on fish.  Scallops - Excellent. Thin panko crust and huge juicy scallop inside.  Shrimp - Excellent. Fried. Big. No complaints here.  Fries - Excellent. Thin (Like I like) and fried perfectly. I like them with lots of salt and the malt vinegar.  I will be back."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise: an unpretentious fast-food-style layout, but clean and pleasant ambiance. Orders delivered to your table after you stand at a counter to order (prices reasonable to modest). Then you eat...YUM! The food is SENSATIONAL!  Best fish (I prefer their haddock) and chips I've ever had. Excellent slaw! Shoestring fries crisp and golden on the outside, tender on the inside. Or try the crab cakes - excellent, and served with a marvelous seafood salad.   The place is now one of our favorite \"finds\" on the west side of the Valley."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Good seafood in a casual atmosphere with reasonable prices. I had the one crab cake meal and it was plenty. The clam chowder was thick and creamy and definitely not from a can. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch with my hubby, food was excellent! Had fish and chips and clam strips, hubby had shrimp taco, and their tres leche cake was to die for!"}
{"text":"great place for sea food plus they offer MWU discounts."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! I have been longing for a casual place to get seafood and I have found it. Great food and completely worth the prices. I can't wait to try everything. If you are not sure get Oscar's Ultimate, it has a little bit of everything. All you can eat fish & chips for $10......Nice and welcoming staff and fast service."}
{"text":"Spent $15 on small piece of fish and some fried clam strips.  Came with mediocre cole slaw and less than mediocre fries.  Fish and clam strips were good, but not worth the price, should've been half of what it was."}
{"text":"Great meal and awesome customer service!  We've eaten here a few times and always had a good experience.  Reminds me of the fish-n-chips we'd have growing up on the coast."}
{"text":"Seafood in the desert? I know it sounds like an oxymoron. Oscar's pier is a small seafood establishment located in a strip mall right next to Midwestern. I've been here often but just found out they also offer a student discount, which I am definitely going to take advantage of from now on. I've had quite a bit of their food but I think their three best offerings are, in no particular order, the crab cakes, the seafood pasta salad, and the fish tacos.   Crab cakes are tough, lots of places in my opinion do it wrong. Oscar's is not one of them. Perfectly fried and seasoned I could probably eat 4-5 of them if I had a big enough stomach.   I really enjoy their seafood pasta salad with the real shrimp and crab in it. It's mildly creamy giving it more flavor and heft while not being heavy. Would definitely recommend it as a side over their generic fries.  Lastly their tacos. I'm sure a lot of you a familiar with lots of establishments offering cheap tacos on Tuesdays. Oscar's does the same but they're 4 dollars. I know it seems like a lot but it's quite a big taco. Really actually quite worth it. You'd probably only ever really order 2, MAYBE 3 if you were absolutely starving. The tacos are generally served with cabbage, tomatoes, a side of salsa and a chipotle drizzle on top of it all. I usually forego the cabbage and chipotle sauce but that's just me. The tacos they use are also warm, incredibly fresh and flakey while maintaining a doughy texture. These are just fantastic. Definitely stop by for some seafood if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Most friendly staff, decent food, clean environment & bloody cheap. Must try the endless catfish fries & coleslaw on Sundays."}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos, fish sandwiches and hush puppies! I have only tried these three things, but will definitely be back for more.  The fish tacos are huge, I can eat only one, where at Rubios, I can eat three.  I think they are better than any other fish taco I have ever had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Employees don't know the meaning of customer service so spend your dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Very casual - order at the counter and seat yourself kind of deal. It definitely lives up to the other reviews. Pretty much everything is fried though which wasn't exactly expecting. Nonetheless, it was delicious. The hush puppies were heavenly. Crab cakes were good and not overly breaded. Their sauces take the cake - the tarter sauce and chipotle sauce were so so good!"}
{"text":"Great local place with excellent service and even better food. The PO-boys are almost as good as they are in Louisiana and everything else we've tried is excellent. We usually do takeout as the place is a bit noisy at peak times but the food is great and always on time. Tip: call in an order early on weekend evenings, as the place is packed and stays that way. Love this place for all things seafood!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed here.  This glorified Long John Silvers fell way short of the expectations other Yelpers have set.  It's a walk up and order type of place and I guess could be called a fast casual but the fish quality or flavor was nothing spectacular.  Temper your expectations and it is a fine place to grab a quick and cheap fish dinner but don't expect fine dining, high quality or flavorful fish!   D."}
{"text":"Wanted fish n chips, food was good. Little spend for the amount. Would go back to try other menu items when in mood for fish. Fish was nice light batter, coleslaw was average."}
{"text":"I wanted to get a good cross section of Oscar's offerings so I chose the Ultimate Combo.   I have to say the batter on all of the fish, crustacean and bivalve items was one of the best I have had in recent memory.    I like their Monday and Tuesday specials and the fact that they close later so I can hit them on the way home from work.    I am already looking forward to trying their $3.50 jumbo fish taco on Tuesday.    Being my first time I was a little confused when I couldn't find tartar sauce at the help yourself condiment counter, then relieved when it was delivered with the food.   I have to say, I have never used less tartar sauce before, I enjoyed the batter and the fish without covering up the flavor with the tartar sauce however, the cocktail sauce was great with the jumbo shrimp.     I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dang. Duh -HAng   This is goo foo!   My mom is deathly allergic to shellfish. That, and I grew up in a desert for 10 of my formative years. When I think of shellfish, I think of slightly forbidden, delicious little delicacies. While growing up the idea of lobster and crab was the ultimate indulgence in haught cuisine, it seemed.  .  The only time my Mom liked fish is when it didn't taste like fish. \"I like swordfish because it's not fishy\", or \"ooh orange roughy is so good! It's not fishy at all\".   I wanted fishy fish. I wanted something that tasted like the ocean. I wanted to see why lobster and crab was so expensive.   In more selfish and morbid moments I hoped a chef would accidentally drop a shrimp into her food so she would die, and I could eat all the seafood I wanted.   There's no lobster at Oscar's Pier 83, but you can get things here that are really rare in Arizona, and plenty of it is exquisitely fishy, in the freshest way imaginable.   I did takeout and I ordered a lot of food:  Oscar's Ultimate Combo (1 Jumbo Shrimp, 1 Jumbo Sea Scallop, 1 Oyster, 1 House Fish, 1 Chicken Strip, 1/4 pound Fried Clam Strips, Fries, Cole Slaw)  THEN  Fried Soft-shell Crab  Crab cake  Clam Chowder   It was all at least 4 stars.   The Exquisite:  The Fried Oyster- My god this was good. Keep in mind I told you I like fishy fish, but this thing was fresh, juicy, full of meat, and perfectly matched my seafood craving. I thought it was a scallop at first, which is one of my favorite things on earth- but it was so much better than any scallop I've ever had.  The Fried Soft Shell Crab- This was served with a pink remoulade like sauce that was divine. This thing was meaty, a little salted, and perfectly flavored. The remoulade was excellent.  The Crab cake- It had a ton of crab in it. The only one I've had that was better was in Maryland overlooking the water. Dipped in the remoulade this more than just good.  The Clam Chowder- It spilled in the car, in the bag, so I brought it in and ate the chowder with a spoon out of the bag. It was that good.   The Very Good-  The House Fish- Really good. Probably the best I've had. What's weird is that I think the excellence of the oyster and soft shell crab overshadowed this. Had I had this on it's own I'd probably be raving about it. It wasn't fishy at all.  The Scallop- It was a little dry and bland. Very big however.  The Shrimp- Better than a lot of shrimp I've had in Arizona- but not the best I've ever had.  The Chicken Strip- Had I been more present at the time of ordering I would have tried to substitute this for something else.   When I go again, I will order the soft shell crab, 3 oysters, and some clam chowder.   Maybe I'll bring in my mom and Oscar will be the one to finally do her in with a stray piece of shrimp (DEVIL LAUGH). I kid, I kid."}
{"text":"This place has excellent fish and chips.  it's very delicious. The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the inconsistent size of fish.  I was there on a thursday night, and the fish was excellent. They were a nice size battered fish. The batter was so delicious, crunchy and tastey and the inside was juicy and soft and flaky. SOOO GOOD!!  BUT, when I went back on Friday, I was disappointed that the battered fish I got was much smaller. The batter was not as good, maybe not as cruncy.  The fish was much smaller and I was alarmed. It looked like a double size fish stick. whereas the night before they looked like a normal restaurant size battered fish pieces that you would expect to pay for.  I was a little disappointed. Especially since I got an extra ala carte fish piece for about $3.99 or so and it looked like a double size fish stick (for that price??) WTF???!!  I then opened up my cod meal to find out all my fish pieces were about that double fish stick size. Much smaller then normal. WTF! I thought to myself.  Nonetheless I ate my battered fish and it was excellent.  But I felt a little confused about the size difference from the night before and felt a little jipped that I paid 20 dollars for 4 battered cod fishes that looked like double size fish sticks. (That included 2 french fries and coleslaw)   I'm going to try going back during the week when the crowds are not there and hope I get the size of fish I got previously the two times I was there.  Hopefully the chef on Friday night is not there the other nights.  If the same thing happens again, I am afraid I may not come back.  Hopefully I get the delicious and nice size battered cod that I got on Thursday night again in the future. The batter was better prepared, the fish cut better sized, and overall just better. Friday night lame night.  I won't be returning on a weekend night again. I will try it one more time during the week. Thursday was good. But, if it's like what I had friday night, then I will have to pass as my money is better spent somewhere else. It was delicious, but the other night was soooo much better."}
{"text":"The fish is very heavily breaded y actual fish per serving is greasy fried fish. Nothing healthy about this place.y not so good. All you can eat is skimpy not so quick to come around to see if you want more. You will have to ask each time you want more  fish or anything else. It is not more than a two star place to eat."}
{"text":"Fresh seafood in Arizona?!!? You heard that right, this place brings the fresh fish that ex coastal dwellers crave.  Oscar's Pier has a large menu that does fried, back and broiled seafood options. They have local Arizona favorites like catfish but for a New Englander myself, they have the elusive Haddock. Haddock is a white fish that is indigenous to the New England region. The reason I'm mentioning this is because this is one of the only places you can find this in the middle of the desert. This fish is so tasty and getting it fried is the best! Their chowdah is pretty good, has a decent amount of cream and the clams are fresh. I'm super picky when it comes to chowdah but this chowdah has a good homestyle taste!  The prices are the best when it comes to seafood in Arizona. I bought a cup of chowdah with one piece of haddock for less than 8 dollars. Plus unlimited tartar sauce, which is a must when eating seafood. I've had their onion rings before and I loved them! They do the thin style which is what I'm accustomed to back home.  Tons of free parking in the parking lot and its in a good location. The decor is fun, tells a story about the restaurant and the staff are friendly. I love that the owner was working in the front and taking orders, shows he is involved in his business and explained to me where they get their seafood source from. Overall, I love this place, it reminds me of a small seafood shack on the boardwalks in Massachusetts. Enough of me talking, go get some good seafood!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and each time is just as amazing. First time I have the fish and shrimp basket and everything was amazing. The second time I just went back for the shrimp. If you want amazing fried shrimp go here. It's a quaint little strip mall restaurant and well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"We went here tonight. Such a great selection to choose from. My Husband and I each had the Ultimate Combo and our kids got the chicken tenders. Everything that was on our plates was huge and super tasty. I worried it would be like Long John Silvers but it surpassed all my expectations. We will surely be back to Pier 83!"}
{"text":"Came here with my 8 year old daughter.  Oscars now has a fan for life.  She loved their food.  She had crunchy cod, as she calls it.  She says it is a big step up from Mandys fish.  I had their cod taco and was very impressed.  Fish was flaky and moist, cooked perfectly.  I also tried the crab cake, very good."}
{"text":"This is the best seafood place we have found since coming to Az 5 yrs ago.  The prices a reasonable for the quality and portions they serve."}
{"text":"This place is EXCELLENT! Ty at the register is awesome!!! He deserves a big tip, he has great customer service skills!!! Delicious Food! Great Service! What more can you ask for? Live it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty shocked at all the rave reviews. I'll say the food is okay, but I must be missing something because it's far from five stars. The staff is friendly and cleans up tables quickly which is nice because the place is small and indoor seating is very limited. I've eaten here twice now. I think the food is just average. The jumbo shrimp are medium in size and the cod is average in flavor. I enjoyed the fish taco (picture) more than the fish n chips. Both the chicken tenders and grilled cheese (picture) from the kids menu were bad news. My daughter is not picky and would barely eat either one. I don't blame her. I don't think we'll be back. This might be a good place for a hangover, but there's better seafood with less grease and bigger portions elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I've had their jumbo shrimp and the crab cakes and I would recommend to a friend as my sister told me about this place."}
{"text":"We came here for a much needed date night on Satuday and really wanting to have some good fish. We we read the good reviews. But the fish was a let down. I got the 3 piece cod with steak fries and huch puppys. The fish was very very oily and not crispy at all. It seemed like the oil was not hot enough and soaked up the oil.  The frys and huch puppys were good. My wife got the fish cod and shrimp with onion rings her fish was a little better but still oilly and a little crisper but not much better. Her shimp was good. We told her about tge fish and she said \"Its the most popular iteam we have I can ask them ti cook longer if you want\" lol Service was slow and was hard to get get refiles and food took a long time to come out. A table across from us got there food before us and ordered after us. (Had a different server and seemed very out going) This was just a let down for us becouse we have 2 special needs daughters and its hard for us to get date nights. We were really disappointed.."}
{"text":"Love it. Great for take out seafood! Very nice people and the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Found this place by looking for places near me on Yelp while driving through.  Food looks exactly how they do in photos.  Very fresh food and overall very clean restaurant! Finally found me a great fish 'n chips place I plan on returning to soon! Where have you been hiding Pier 83?!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, good prices.  Best seafood in the area!  The family eats here almost weekly"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic. I actually like their food better than Pappadeaux's on Black Canyon. There are oyster Poor Boy sandwiches for lunch are to die for. Best seafood in town and I used to eat at Taylor's chowder house all the time."}
{"text":"Hands down the best local restaurant in the Valley. My family eats here regularly. We love it! The fish is quality fish and its served hot! We love seeing the same familiar smiling faces of their employees. The manager always checks on us, and one can see the pride in making sure we are happy. Please don't change anything!!  PS- we miss the lobster!!!!"}
{"text":"This is positively our new go to seafood place!   Had a craving for fresh seafood so we googled places near our location and Oscar's came up.  We decided to take a chance and are so very glad we did!    We had a wonderful experience from the service, to the cleanliness.  The atmosphere to the quality and quantity.   Prices were very fair and they even make their very own desserts and bread!!!!    Daily specials and great choices on the menu!  You deserve to treat yourself to Oscar's Pier 83!     And by the way- the shrimp tacos are to die for!!"}
{"text":"This is a very casual family owned seafood restaurant where you order at the counter and they run the food to you. Most of the seafood is fried but they do offer broiled  seafood too and many people come for the all you can eat seafood specials. The special of the day was called jumbo halibut taco for $6.75 so I ordered it and had my choice of broiled or fried. I didn't think one taco would be enough so I added on a side salad for somewhere around $3.00. My taco was very packed with LOTS of very fresh shredded cabbage but my fish was terribly dry but edible and was plain but on the top of all that cabbage and some diced tomatoes was a tasty creamy chipotle sauce and on the side was a fresh made pico. They called it jumbo and it was big but it was the same size as the other tacos my husband ordered. The side salad was freshly made and not from a bag.  The fried fish tacos my husband had (shrimp and maui maui) were much better than the  halibut. They were set up the same way but he asked for the creamy sauce of the side. For my husband he thought they had too much cabbage in them and he scooped half the cabbage out.   I've been here before but it was a while back. I'll go back because they offer many other tasty things to try but it is too soon to be a fan (4 stars) because of the very dry halibut but I do note maybe they normally cook it better and I just got an over cooked one?  The person at the counter was very patient and helpful in the ordering process.  I hope to up them a star on my next visit."}
{"text":"We had a really good meal here. Thanks fellow Yelpers for the tip. Your reviews led us here.   First off, this place was HOPPING when we arrived! Super busy. When we received our order we discovered why; the food is outrageously good! The wife had the two piece cod fish n chips with sweet potato fries and coleslaw. I had the Oscars Combo - two pieces of cod, two, jumbo shrimp, two calamari strips, 1/4 lb of clam strips, two hush puppies, coleslaw and fries.  The cod was dense. Almost heavy for its size. The batter was light, crispy and flavorful. The inside was white, delicately flavored and flaky. Perfection! The jumbo shrimp were some of THE BEST fried shrimp I've ever eaten! The calamari was served in an unique way; big thick, long strips, lightly battered and fried to perfection. Calamari is one of those things that must be cooked just right or it becomes tough. This was cooked as it should be - not tough in the slightest. My clam strips were the usual fare that you can get anywhere. Nothing special. Same for the hush puppies and coleslaw. The fries however were nice and thin, just the way I like 'em. Oh, and very crispy too.  Try the cocktail sauce. It has a bit of a bite with some horseradish. I wasn't a fan of their tartar sauce but the wife loved it.   If we lived in this area they would be a regular stop for dinner. Try them out. You won't be disappointed.   By the way, they have a nice selection of salads and offer broiled versions of their seafood, if fried food isn't your thing."}
{"text":"Seafood in AZ is always a dodgy proposition; very happy we came by. Good fried shrimp (my 6 yr old's dinner), hush puppies where light and tasty. As an East Coaster reading that they had New England clam chowder got by BS radar going, but it was very nice. Warm and think, light clam flavor, definitely a reorder but next time BREAD BOWL baby!  Whoa Mahi-Mahi taco, really the highlight order. It was BIG, the fish was cooked right (still moist), and some sort of sauce that was a knockout. Really good on the fish."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 3 star rating because I think it's a tad over priced for what it is.  Don't get me wrong the food is good and customer service is good BUT you have have to weigh price verses food and this is definitely high priced....however I would go back, maybe not as much as I would if it was priced better though....that's my take on this place, like it or not."}
{"text":"This is a nice local restaurant that's somewhat hidden in a shopping center. I've driven by on a few occasions and did not see it.   The staff was helpful and friendly. The food was the highlight of the visit.  I had fried shrimp which were big and tasty. My wife had fried soft shelled crab which was good but, a bit small.   Overall not fancy but, a nice family restaurant."}
{"text":"We are snow birds who have been eating here  for four seasons. We have tried many of the selections and have found all of them excellent!  Of course we have our favorites like the fried shrimp and fried oysters! We had a shrimp poboy and a mahi mahi sandwich tonight....really good...plus on Wednesdays, sandwiches are 20 % off!  There are specials throughout the week. For good seafood, Pier 83 blows Red Lobster out of the water!  The place is not fancy but their service and seafood is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Was expecting more but was disappointed and will not be back. I felt as they nuclear and dime you. I ordered the shrimp poor boy for 11 bucks, j asked the girl at the counter if it came with anything and she said no. I asked so it's a la cart? And she said yes. So I decided to order a side of coleslaw and 4 shrimps. I also ordered two cocktail Sauces for the shrimp. When my good arrived I was surprised that the poor boy came with only lettuce and tomato and the fried shrimp no sauces whatsoever. It was the driest sandwich I've ever earned. I had to grab some mayo for it. The shrimp was as expected but what posted me off the most was that the sandwich h did come with fries but the girl at the counter reflected to  tell me that. I also noticed complementary cocktail sauce by the soda machine which would've been free. Unfortunately I saw that after I had paid. In addition the food came without my coleslaw so I had to ask for it despite already paying for it. Will not recommend it be returning."}
{"text":"Can't wait to take my mom! I remember when they first opened and we checked it out... it's a tough little corner but they must have loyal clients. I STRONGLY urge you to check it out.   I was craving a Shrimp Po Boy Sandwhich and that's what I got! With some hush puppies! DELICIOUS! Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient service. Ordered the cod and shrimp combo and it was delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place while on the west side, I love fried seafood so I decided to try it, it honestly good but not over the top great..  you honestly don't get to much for the money you spend. The ambiance was ok nothing spectacular.. I wouldn't go out of my way to seek my seafood craving."}
{"text":"Happy to have finally found a fresh seafood restaurant in Phoenix. The guys behind the counter were very welcoming and nice. The quality of the food is top notch!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal at one of our new favorite places!! Always wonderfully friendly service there! The staff is always helpful and remember us! It feels like our home away from home...only with better seafood!! Thanks everyone at Oscar's for always making it a fun and yummy experience!!"}
{"text":"The fish was cooked to order and was hit and delicious. The tartar sauce and coleslaw was delish. Would definitely come back again.  They have an all you can eat tilapia special!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent cod. Great batter. Hush puppies are very good. Never going back to long john silvers. Even my 5 year old loved it."}
{"text":"After eating this shrimp po-boy, I was ready to walk the plank.  Stopped in here on a hot sunny Arizona day around noon. As I passed the threshold into the establishment, I was whisked away to the spirit of Long John Silver's big brother, Long Oscar Silver.   The signage on the walls, the smell of the salty ocean air (could have been a fart, not sure), the seagulls flying around the room. It was like a vacation trip to the set of Deadliest Catch.   I ordered the shrimp po-boy as I previously mentioned, with a side of french style fries. The sandwich was very tasty. A hot-buttered hoagie style roll, crispy fried shrimp, and a little cajon mayo were the stars of this little three-ring circus. A delicate balance of taste and sensual adventure.  I would love to bump this one up to five stars... but the price was just a little beyond my comfort zone. You can expect to pay at least $10 if you want a real meal. That being said, most people won't have an issue forking over a little green for some of this mean surf."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the service and the food.  We read the reviews here and a large group went to eat at Oscars.  The cod fish and chips were a frozen pre breaded product.  Looked and tasted like the fish you get in the grocery store in the freezer aisle.  The salmon was too expensive for the portion size.  The garbage can on the patio is an open household rubbermaid can.  It was overflowing and attracting flies.  The server brought the food to the table and told us to go inside to get our utensils."}
{"text":"Jo said she just needed a newspaper wrapping and she would have been in Dublin.  Well, I think that's a bit exagerrated.   First, sorry to all you chowder lovers, but this would never make it in New England.  Too thick with flour.  Never again. Catfish - wonderful.  4.5 star, for sure.  Thin crust...just like it should be.  Fine piece of fish. Fries - excellent.  Not english style - more like McDonalds, but they were good. Hush puppies - forget it.  Throw 'em out.  Maybe if they provided lots of butter, but they don't. Service - fine.  We had a little confusion with the order.  I think the guy was a little new and I won't blame him....but in general, much better than you would expect in this type of casual place.  They could do a bit better cleaning off the tables between customers, but you know what?  That's a very minor complaint. Price - a bit high.  But we don't have much choice for good \"chip shops\" (as they say in Glasgow) do we?"}
{"text":"I love seafood and its been a while since I've had some. (Excluding Long John Silvers). And I was taking my family out for a Friday night feast.   We found this little hole in the wall restaurant randomly around 59th ave and Union Hills. And we decided to try it out.  At first glance, the interior was.....kinda plain. It didn't really have a \"pier\" feel to it and take away the small amount of wall decorations, you get an empty room with cheep tables and chairs everywhere. But it was busy. And everyone seemed happy with what they were eating.   I noticed the rather large beer selection they had going on. Cool little spot to have a social brunch with some friends, plus they had a flat screen which probably played sports.   Also it smelled good in there. I and my family were really hungry, (especially my daughter), and nothing teased our appetites like the lingering smell of fresh seafood being cooked in the back.   So we made our choices, sat down and our food arrived. We got the platter sampler, which had a variety of fried sea foods. We got the large clam chowder inside of the fresh baked bread bowl. And we got a large fried shrimp burrito. The kids got a kids meal plate each which was very small. So warning to anybody, if you have a kid 7 and up, get him or her a normal plate because I promise you they will be disappointed.   On the flip side, our sampler plate was huge. April and I had a concern that we couldn't share our platter since only one of each seafood was in the description on the menu, but our fears were put to rest when we were rewarded with very large samples. So the sampler plate was delicious. The hush puppies we fresh. Also the sampler had chicken, which was OK. A little dry.   The clam chowder was very good. So was the bread bowl. But We felt like it was too cold. Like they should have heated it up more. And in fact when I asked them too, they gave us another free bowl of hotter chowder which was pretty cool. The staff was very friendly by the way. They answered all our questions. They didn't argue. The checked in on us every once in a while. Good staff.   The highlight food was the fried shrimp burrito. April and I both loved it. We used to get our shrimp burritos from Rubios but after the one from Pier 83, we may have found our new provider. It was well made too. Not too soggy, (until around the end of it). Good amount of shrimp. Not over fried. Perfect.   Overall this place was a fantastic find. A little pricey for us average people, but not too pricey for a family out night. Will I be back? Yes. Oh and also I believe Weds is all you can eat fried fish night."}
{"text":"Everything is great about this place, down to the cashier, who happens to be the owner. It's a very casual, friendly spot. Haddock fish and chips are the best I've had in Arizona. 6 different kinds of fish, along with a great variety of menu items. Can't wait to take the long drive out here soon."}
{"text":"Being from the North Carolina coast and now living in Glendale, Arizona I find that the food I miss the most is seafood. Clearly living in Arizona limits my ability to find good, fresh seafood-let alone trying to find well prepared seafood. Tonight I found fresh seafood that was prepared just the way I like it-fried with extra sides of tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, coleslaw (mayo not red), and a healthy selection of domestic beer.   Ty, the server at the counter, was helpful and very interested in making sure the dining experience was met with great service. While the atmosphere left you feeling like you may end up with a pirate cap (e.g. Long John Silver), the beach music on the radio made me feel like I was home.   This wonderful little find came to me by pure accident as my wife was giving me directions to Next Place Coffee (see my next review) and mistakenly gave me 59th and Union Hills as cross-streets. Great mistake, babe, because we were treated to a little bit of home.   I'd recommend Oscar's Pier 83 to anyone in the market for a quick, well prepared dinner."}
{"text":"After stopping by Sole Sports running store next door, we started walking to our car parked directly in front of Pier 83. We had been to Pier 83 a couple times before, yet we forget it's right there!   Today, in spite of having a large breakfast, I was craving a bread bowl with New England clam chowder. The chowder is creamy and thick, just how I like it! Instead of just warming the bread bowl, they actually toasted it, so it had that nice crisp to the edges. They did a great job scooping out the middle of the bread bowl so that they could fit more chowder inside, which is something other places that serve bread bowls don't take the time to do.   My husband enjoyed the fried oysters. He had the large order of 6 fried oysters. The batter to him was just right but since there were only 6, he did not share them with me. He was nice enough to share some of his fries, which I thought were prepared well! The cut was about the same size cut as McDonald's fries but I'm only comparing size. The taste of these fries were obviously superior and same goes for texture.  If you wanted to spicy anything up, they had Sriracha, Louisiana hot sauce and some other spicy varieties.   The restaurant is very spacious and clean. No seafood scent present either despite being a seafood restaurant. The atmosphere is laid back. Typical order at the counter and have your food delivered later situation. We need to come here more often! I hear the fish and chips are great so I'll have to order that next time!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in town best soft crab shell tacos on Town best employees ever they take care of you they know you by name they remember what you like won't go anywhere else for fish"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips! Fish wasn't over cooked at all, tasted quite fresh and the fries were also fresh and crispy! This place is also really clean also... Like spotless... Employees are very nice too, which is great.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Living in AZ, it's hard to find reasonably-priced seafood! Oscar's Pier 83 is by far, the best in the West Valley. The menu is priced well, and the awesome service is just as good. Highly recommend this place! Looking forward to dining here more often!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chip place I've been to in a long time. Super clean and smells good. Food was on point and nothing was ... Ehhh ok. It was all great. Now it's time to explore the rest of the menu. Great job guys."}
{"text":"After we finished eating and were heading to the car hubby declared \"this was fish done right.\" Followed by \"that was good.\" This came from a man who considers \"it was okay\" high praise. I had fish with calamari and hubby had fish. We both substituted clam chowder for the fries - well worth the $2 up charge. Coleslaw also came with.  The food was great. The crew was friendly. The music was pleasing and not too loud. The tvs were tuned to sports (no establishment should ever be tuned to news). The restaurant was very clean. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Really great fish and chips, great amount of food for good price, fresh as it can be. The mahi-mahi had great tease"}
{"text":"The fish here is good, however, the portions are far less than good. The $7 Halibut taco that claims a portion size of 4oz weighed in at 1.3oz and the Mahi Mahi taco weighed in at 1.8oz.  We have talked with the establishment on more than one occasion about this, but they do not seem to care. All they will say is \"it loses a little broiling it\".  It does not lose over half Oscar! See photos."}
{"text":"Great fish & chips, excellent scallop, excellent oyster!!  Had the sampler for my first visit!!  The only thing that did not hook me was the chicken tender, but what the hey its white chicken so I don't expect much!  Next visit I will stick to the fish & chips.   I did not care for the fried clam strips but all else was great!!"}
{"text":"Average, would go again if I was passing by.  Shrimp and clam strips where good but fried, and I am not one for a completely fried meal."}
{"text":"Visited this place while my mother in law was in town. She picked it out while looking up restaurants in the area that were rated well. So we wondered on in, and by the looks of it I honestly didn't think I was going to be impressed with the food. I usually prefer more of an \"upscale\" ambiance when going to dinner because I like that experience.  I ordered the catfish tacos....the most amazing catfish I have ever eaten. The taco was huge. My husband got the shrimp po-boy. He LOVED IT. he said he wants to go back every day. My mother in law ordered the shrimp Louie salad and was impressed with how much shrimp she got on the salad.  I topped off the meal with their hand made bundt cakes that some local lady makes and takes in there daily. The hardest decision was picking out the flavor because everything sounded delicious but I settled with the Almond Joy Bundt Cake and took it home to drink a cup of coffee with it. AMAZING!  Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"This place has been a half mile away from me for a year and a half. I can't believe I just barely came to try it. BIG THUMBS UP! The soft shell crab is a must try! Everything was great. Clean restaurant and friendly staff ."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  My only regret is not finding this place sooner!  I love broiled fish tacos and this is the only place in the valley that I can honestly say has the best!!  Next time I come I will definitely try the clam chowder....having 2 Mahi Mahi tacos, I have no room to try the soup....lol."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review after eating here tonight. Basically, the staff are super-friendly, but apart from not having enough tables, their prices are way too high for what you get, in my experience of getting similar food elsewhere.  Here's my bill:  2 piece cod and fries: $9.99 Upgrade thin fries for thick fries: $ .50 2 Jumbo Shrimp: $3.20 ($1.60 each) 1 regular drink: $1.89  Sub-Total: $15.58 Tax: $1.59 Grand Total: $17.17  Yes, over $17 dollars for one meal!  As for the discount coupon in the Phoenix New Times, well, apparently after I published my original review letting people know how to save some money from this expensive place, they haven't offered any more coupons in the New Times since.  The food is good, but is marked up approximately 25% higher then what I would consider to be reasonable.  Also, the receipt they hand you does not list anything you ordered. Only the sub-total, tax and grand total. It's impossible to confirm if what you were charged is accurate without breaking out a calculator and doing the math yourself while you are there looking at the menu with prices listed on the wall behind the counter.  Again, the food is good and the staff are friendly, but neither is good enough to justify these prices and to stand around waiting for a table to become available."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today. when I got there their was not even one customer in the restaurant. continue reading to find out why. this is what I learned. I found they serve very small portions for VERY LARGE PRICES , But I do have to give credit where credit is due I had two small pcs of halibut and a small hand full of very thin French fries the fish tasted like it was fresh caught today Very impressive. the price $14.99  OUCH !  This was my first and last visit to Oscars. If you want that kind on money for the small portions  I Recommend you move to Scottsdale where us POOR people cant afford to eat."}
{"text":"Very glad to come across this place on yelp. Very friendly and clean, most importantly the food is great. Definitely will be back to try something else on the menu. A great place to have seafood."}
{"text":"best poor boy sandwich i've ever had, period.  ever!!!!!!! We almost didn't go in because it's in a strip mall. Don't make that mistake.  Go, you'll LOVE it"}
{"text":"The mahi mahi taco is delicious, however I was not a fan of the clam chowder it was way to thick for my liking."}
{"text":"They now offer all u can eat but watch the times. It is something like Mon-Sat 3-5 and 7-9 and all day Sunday.   If you have not been here yet. Check it out. There is something for everyone here.   Today we had the 3 piece with Fry's and slaw, but since the pieces were small he gave us #4. That was really cool. Everything was cooked perfectly and we had a great lunch."}
{"text":"WOW! Tried this place for the first time and had the fish taco special. It was awesome! My son has the kids chicken and it had a nice lite batter and was tasty too. Definitely try this place. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for several years and it is without a doubt one of the best places in Phoenix for fresh seafood. Outstanding quality at a reasonable price. The Pacific Cod fish-n-chips are excellent. White, flaky, light, not greasy and perfectly breaded.  I prefer steak fries ($1 extra) over the regular fries.  Fish Tacos are huge and delicious (one of my favorites).  Clam Chowder has a nice balance of clams and potatoes with a creamy consistency and rich flavor.  Oscar's Ultimate Combo offers a taste of just about everything and requires a fairly healthy appetite.  Beverages are self serve and alcohol (beer & wine) are available.  Seating is limited inside, but there is additional seating outside.  It can get really crowded during the lunch time rush."}
{"text":"One of our favorite little fish places. The clam chowder is delicious. The broiled salmon meal is, too. They get very busy on Friday and Saturday evenings. However, the line moves quickly."}
{"text":"The food was great. I ordered the shrimp and Cod combo and it was delicious. Highly recommend this place. A bit pricey but it's worth it."}
{"text":"back again for my fish fry.  I decided to try the catfish.  It was butter tender, not a SINGLE bone and melted in my mouth with a light tempura like batter coating.  It was HUGE!.  I thought I could not finish but it was more than delectable, hot and crispy, light and tasty.  I don't know if they make their own tartar sauce but it was very tasty as well.  The fries, as usual, are very hot and crispy and the thin cut that I like as well.  The place is always hopping and I can see why.  Will keep coming."}
{"text":"Had dinner there the last two weeks, food consistently awesome!! Fantastic fish taco! Katie waited on us again, great service!!"}
{"text":"Been here once few years ago. It was an awesome little place with great food. Definitely need to go back really soon."}
{"text":"Did NOT like this place at all. Food was decent but service was lousy. Was disappointed. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food arrived very fast and very fresh. Everything tasted amazing and was so much food! Portions were awesome, especially the po boy! Best of all, I asked for extra tartar and lemme tell ya, they came through! So much tartar sauce and extra chipotle! Your food rocks and I look forward to ordering again (and my leftovers!)"}
{"text":"I was looking for something different for my husband's birthday and happened upon this place. It's not visible from the street and, although we drive by there a lot, we never saw it. Considering the prices other places charge for seafood, this was a diamond in the rough. The fish was fresh, the veggies weren't cooked to death and the shrimp Louie was wonderful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There are some great pier seafood joints in Cali.  I think that's what the place is going for but it ends up being closer to a food truck vibe as they serve everything in a hard paper container.  They have fish and chips as well as tacos.  I had the fish & chips.  The fish was nicely cooked, although I prefer it crispier, and the portions were reasonable for the price.  They have a variety of sides if you aren't into chips and slaw.  Malt vinegar is on the table as you would expect but it was pretty weak for malt vinegar."}
{"text":"People in this town wouldn't know good seafood if it knocked on their door and bit 'em on the nose. I guess I'm somewhat of a seafood snob being from NY and having spent my youth vacationing in Cape Cod. Now, don't get me wrong, this place doesn't have BAD food. It's just not as good as everyone makes it out to be.   Let's be clear in one thing: The service was top notch and the restaurant was overall clean and casually decorated. I have no beef with the folks who run the place... Except for ONE thing...   If you're going to tout your \"signature dish\" as being \"crab stuffed salmon,\" it had better be stuffed with REAL crab. (Not krab) $16 for salmon that is stuffed with imitation crab doesn't sit well with me. Let's be honest and call a spade a spade. And it doesn't stop there. The crab in the seafood salad is also imitation. That can hardly be classified as fresh seafood.  So, to conclude my little trip to Pier 83 I leave with a heavy disappointment. The service I'd rate a 5. The food I give a 3. I may come back and try something else but not the salmon again. And I would love it if they were honest and clarified on the menu that they don't use real crab in some of their dishes. It's just tad misleading."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, more meat than batter, light and crispy. Fries didn't taste like fish, Cole slaw was excellent, atmosphere was casual and clean, fast and great service. Would go again!"}
{"text":"The best item on the menu is the claim chowder. The other items ( fried cod & scallops) was bland - needed some serious seasoning."}
{"text":"I love this place. If I lived closer, I would eat there at least once a week. Everything I have tried is good, especially the huge fried shrimp  with homemade spicy cocktail sauce. Their soup and bread is delicious, too. Had a great King Louie salad there once when I was being virtuous. I still need to try their fish tacos which I hear are yummy.  Just as good as the food is the friendly cashier (not sure if he's the owner) who just always seems to be in a good mood. Definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Hubby had oyster poor boy and I had fish tacos. Great food. Great place to be good, bad or good-ish. Will be back to try the broiled fish and shrimp baskets"}
{"text":"OYSTERS are outstanding!  Clean welcoming place to enjoy your seafood experience!  Always pleasant service and friendly employees !  Not close to my home so have to drive a distance but so worth the drive !"}
{"text":"I really like fresh seafood. It's hard to find good quality seafood in landlocked states.   We found this place on yelp. So we decided to cruise over and check it out. When we arrived the place was clean. The guy behind the counter was kind and patient with us as we had 5 kids with us. The pricing was about right for seafood.  Our food came out pretty quick. Large cuts of fish and the flavor was absolutely delicious. They place is like eating on the pier in a coastal area. I'm so bummed out we don't have a place like this here in Colorado.   Next time we're in the area we will eat here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best fish and chips in the west valley. There is a vast variety of fish to be eaten. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Oscar's was a nice find for us. Live just down the street but first time here, We'll be back. Wife had the fish taco and loved it, cod was moist and tender and just the proper texture. They were a bit heavy on the sauce that was put on but not enough to distract from the flavor. I had the fish n chips with cod, it was cooked very well, not over fried and also moist and tender. I really like the variety of seafood that is available here, and the menu is straight forward and simple. Great place for this type of food especially if your not in the mood for a full scale restaurant. Well be back often."}
{"text":"Great food, great employees and a casual atmosphere! Never disappointed in the quality or flavor. If you love fish and chips, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. Will be back for sure.  Love the salmon and crab cakes.  Defiantly worth the money."}
{"text":"Excellent Fish & Chips with the Cod, I upgraded the fries to Clam Chowder and it was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"I had the cod fish and chips with coleslaw. It was OK. One of the pieces I bit in to squirted hot water on me. My friend had a crab cake which she said was really good. Even early in the evening the inside was packed so we ate on the patio. It was cold without heaters, luckily I had a hoodie in the car I went and grabbed. I would probably go back."}
{"text":"Best fried fish that I've found in Phoenix! Even my boyfriend, a Seattle native, was surprised and complimented the quality/flavor.  Highly recommend the seafood salad and the fried cod.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just had a delicious jumbo shrimp taco. I also ordered their  New England style clam chowder to go. I've had it here before. It's good Having owned a restaurant in the 1990's I know how tough the Biz. I got out after 10 years  Everyone is an effin critic. Here is my two cents Does the owner know that his employees are closing down 30 mins before 9pm!!! My pet peeve is sweeping mopping Etc while People are dining. For me that's just a no go Food is great and I'll be back Oh also counter girl should ask customers to check in on Yelp and save 10 percent. Guess I'll save mine for next time All these things I have just described are training issues"}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi fried to crispy golden-ness....  Oh my!  It was so good, but the wait was SOOO long.  Sat on the patio and enjoyed the night skies."}
{"text":"This is a super cute place! We sure didn't mind driving 25 min to check it out. I had a fish taco and sweet potato fries. The fish taco was big enough to fill me up. Very good customer service and we sure will return for all you can eat catfish on sundays (i believe)!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently ate lunch here. We haven't been here in a few years. It remains a good place to go for lunch or dinner. I ordered the one piece fish and chips with coleslaw and fries. My husband chose the bowl of clam chowder. I had ice tea and he had water. The cod was fresh and fried in a tasty batter until crispy. The coleslaw was creamy. The fries were hot and fresh, not greasy or oily. The ice tea was really good.  My husband's clam chowder was fresh, creamy and tasty. He enjoyed every bite of it. We will definitely return in the future and this time we won't wait several years between visits. I really missed this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and a great price. The wife and I truly enjoyed it. The place was packed too!  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I agree with you going to San Diego can be pricey! So save your money and use it locally at this wonderful eatery where you can tell it is a locally owned business. The food here is better than you would find at a chain restaurant! SUPPORT THE LOCALLY OWNED BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"Not even worth 1 star wife and I looking for a good valentine's dinner. I ordered the  AHI tuna dinner the tuna was NOT fresh but obviously frozen was dry like cardboard. Wife had crab cakes which were also not fresh and we're like sawdust. Pasta salad had that artificial seafood mix you can buy at Frys for $1.00 a pound. It's amazing how a place like the can get 4 stars"}
{"text":"Best place in town for a quick fish dinner. Wish they had smelt. Very friendly staff. Packed during Lent."}
{"text":"I used to work across the street at Honeywell and we ate at Oscar's fairly regularly. When I hit Phoenix there are two places I must hit for grub and Oscar's is one of them. Best fried fish I have ever had, and that includes Ireland and the U.K.    Their batter is light and the fish is thick. No cheapo cuts here. The fries are lightly seasoned and the tartar sauce is fantastic. I am no coleslaw lover so I ask for hushpuppies instead and those too are excellent.  The decor is simple with a lot of seagoing junk on the walls surrounded by a few lame imaginary water scenes, think dolphins swimming through some underwater otherworld. Whatever. The food trumps it all and you will simply love the place.   Price is about $10 unless you hit a lunch special but you get a lot of goodness for that ten-spot you just dropped.  There are quite a few choices but I have come to prefer the cod minis. Give'em a try why dontcha?  The staff is excellent and the owner is a delight. I called in an order and they asked where I was so they could drop in the food at just the right time so it was piping hot. Outstanding fellas!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good, but a bit overpriced. If not for the coupon I had, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return when there are so many other places closer to home."}
{"text":"This is a great place for seafood on the westside of town. Fresh. Fries and hush puppies are very tasty too. Order ahead. This place is always packed."}
{"text":"We originally hailed from Northern Virginia, very close to Baltimore Maryland which is famous for their seafood.  Thanks to Yelp, we found the pier. I was wondering where the pier was, but heck in the desert I knew that was improbable. :)  As mentioned in other reviews, it is off the beaten trail. My GPS did its job and got us there. It is in a hidden strip mall, and very unassuming. Looks can be deceiving. After searching the menu, you place your order, and then your meal will be delivered in turn. Okay where do I go from here? The clam chowder is delicious. I am very particular about my chowder. The fish tacos according to my husband are very good. The fish (fried) is delectable. I am partial to the fried oysters and the clams. Both of which were plump and very tasteful. There is so much to say---their coleslaw is terrific. I tried to bribe them for their recipe, but was politely declined. LOL We generally go on off hours to avoid the crowds. I have noticed quite a few people getting their call ahead orders for take-out. The staff is friendly and helpful. They know of what they speak. The tarter and cocktail sauce are great. I know it must be made in house. The salads are fresh. (I have yet to have the Crab Louie), but am looking forward to it. Hush-Puppies were great. Don't forget to take a look at the little bunt cakes that are in the cooler at the end of the line. I can't remember her name, but I spoke to her, and she makes those for in-house. Soooo, if you are craving seafood in the desert, you will not be disappointed. This is a must have for sea-food lovers. *Addition to my original review. One time in our multiple visits, my  husband ordered the cheeseburger. It was huge and juicy, one of the best that I ever had...(I got a huge bite)...So if you are a landlubber, check it out...I still vote for the coleslaw...."}
{"text":"Great people great food great price! We awarded the crab Louie salad in the broiled tuna plate. Our friends ordered the grilled salmon salad instead it was fantastic plus they have really great gluten-free options."}
{"text":"Best Fish and Chips around. Fish was fresh and flaky. Melted in my mouth. Gave us a lot of fry's recommend sharing with someone."}
{"text":"Always great service, and the food is excellent! The shrimp louie sandwich is my go-to, but everything is great :)"}
{"text":"Great little quick seafood gem in Northern Glendale. Finally made it here after having it bookmarked forever.  Only had the fried oysters for seafood which I loved.  Perfect timing for me cause they had over ordered on the oysters so they were on special. Delicious, yes on the small side but they threw in a few extra cause they were small. Also tasted the hush puppies which were good. Friends had the fish and chips and there was no disappointment. Time to go again."}
{"text":"I was very very happy with this whole experience! The place was easy to find and parking was great! The decor inside was super cute and looked like it would be a restaurant in New England. I'm from Maine and I'm very picky with my seafood, that being said I was impressed with ALL of the food we got! We got the fishwich, the jumbo fish taco, a crab cake and an order of the calamari strips! To our surprise they had a specials board and we got all the items accept the sandwich for $3.50 each!! We both agreed that our favorite was the CRAB CAKE and close to follow was the tender CALAMARI STRIP APP. The chipotle sauce that comes with the crab cakes was to die for! We will for surely be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here before, and loved the food! The fish and chips were very large, and were very tasty and were a decent price.  Yesterday, I don't know what happened, but the fish was worse than the fish sticks you'd make at home. It tasted microwaved, was rubbery, and VERY fishy.  I ordered the Monday special of Calamari, and it was like I paid $4 to have super salty fried rubber bands. We spent $37 for two people, and ended up throwing it out.  We were still hungry so went down the parking lot to The Rogue Tomato- it was delicious, and about the same price (but for GREAT food)."}
{"text":"The food is great and the place is local! I had the fried shrimp meal with a side of hush puppies. The hush puppies were  seasoned nicely and came with a good dipping sauce. The shrimp were huge and fried perfectly. My hubby got the combo platter. The platter could easily feed two people. I tasted the cod, chicken and clams, they were all great! We will definitely be back to try other items on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"First time lunch here. It's a casual order at the counter place. Very clean and the service was fast! We tried their 3 piece cod fish fry with fries and coleslaw. Everything was great! No complaints. I'll be back :-)"}
{"text":"Every year the place is still consistently fresh and wonderful tasting!  Feel free to read my previous reviews for a complete review of all the dishes I've had.  This time I tried the crab cakes and Soft Shell Crab.  The soft shell crab is soooooo yummy, perfectly fried.  The crab cakes are very flavorful, not all real crab, but it was on special that day and it tastes great and is held together well. If you enjoy real crab cakes, don't order these, I probably won't in the future. But if you just want a good crab cake for an affordable price, get them."}
{"text":"Delicious, hot and fresh out of the fryer.  The fish batter is light, fluffy with a nice crunch on the outside.  The manager was a ray of sunshine and took great care of us, despite it being a simple counter service model.  The tartar sauce is stellar, hush puppies delightful and the skinny fries were perfect.  A+"}
{"text":"If what you were looking for is low-key ambience with a patio, great food and friendly staff, then this is it!  I highly recommend Oscars fried jumbo shrimp. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. Seafood was fresh and on point. Not too much batter to fish ratio, just right. We ordered fried oysters, cod, fries and hush puppies. Large portion and seasoned perfectly.  I must aay, the condiment bar and fountain drink area was VERY clean. (Something I pay a lot of attention to) even the bathroom was kept very clean and had a fresh scent I  there. Anyway, you know the food is good when my very picky five yr enjoys it. Must try!!"}
{"text":"Food was hot, however the fries had more seasoning than food. Simple We had Catfish, Calamari, and Shrimp."}
{"text":"Good seafood. Tilapia is a little fishy for me so I recommend the catfish or cod. A little pricey but fresh so it balances out. All you can eat was the way to go. Fries were great. Clam Chowder was fantastic. So we're the hush puppies. Nice and clean and great seating."}
{"text":"Order from the counter, very friendly service and very tasty food! Stopped in because of the Yelp recommendations and were not disappointed. Had the fish and chips and wife had the cod taco. Both very good. I had the three piece fish and chips but next time would do the two piece. Very generous portions."}
{"text":"Found this place based on a recommendation from a friend, and it was quite a surprise to find a very good fish and chips place in the desert. On Sunday's they have all you can eat catfish/fries/cole slaw for 12.99 which is a really solid deal!   The pieces of cat fish are pretty large and they're all made fresh to order. The fries are very similar to McDonald's fries and there are no complaints about the Cole slaw. I would say the tartar sauce they served is not anything that I would write home about and didn't end up using too much of it. They have a variety of hot sauces at the table and offer both ketchup and cocktail sauce in the condiment bar. When you want more cat fish or fries, you simply tell the person at the front and they bring it out in about 5-8 minutes.   I would definitely come back to this place if I have a craving for fish and chips in the valley!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place and went based on positive yelp reviews and local media. We ordered the shrimp po boy, fish tacos, calamari, shrimp cocktail and crab stuffed salmon. By far the salmon was the best, but the crab is imitation crab (we asked, they confirmed). All other dishes were fried, except shrimp cocktail which were small previously frozen shrimp served in a to go sauce cup. The calamari were \"stick\" shaped, like large fries, rather than rings, so we wondered what it was. We eat calamari often and have never seen it like that.   It's not that it's horrible though. Okay for a quick lunch to satisfy the urge for fried seafood. The atmosphere is very casual...overall just a step up from fast food. But If you're looking for truly fresh seafood this isn't the place."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood, only complaint would be a little on the steep side in price. But would not change a thing in quality."}
{"text":"Yum! If you like sea food then try this place. So far I haven't had anything that tasted anything less than great.  Clean and friendly establishment."}
{"text":"Whoa! Crazy generous portions here! Thankfully I only ordered one broiled cod taco as it was huge and tasty! Kids really liked their shrimp po boys, which were also ginormous. Perfectly fried seafood here. Nice, clean, casual setting. Nice, friendly staff."}
{"text":"We ordered cod fish and chip with some drinks. The food was good but it was overpriced. Probably not going back for that reason."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for lunch at noon on a Friday. Place was not too busy when we arrived, but people were waiting for tables by the time we left. We were greeted by owner, who pushed two tables together for us to accommodate our group. Food was excellent. The upgrade to sweet potato fries was worth it, as was the upgrade to the seafood pasta salad. It seemed to have krab in it, but was delicious. Most ordered fish, and were pleased. One girl had shrimp, and it looked wonderful. I had clams, which were good, but I will go with oysters next time. Clam chowder was super thick and good. We had a great time. Food was better than expected, staff was friendly. Place was clean and pleasant. Prices were reasonable. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Cod fish n chips were very good.   Service outstanding.  Very busy but line moves fast.  We left stuffed to the gills and would come back again."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times!  Their seafood...anything from fish to scallops to clam strips tasted fresh each and every time.  Clam chowder bread bowl is even more amazing.  You can taste real clams with great flavors, and their sourdough bowl is the best I have ever had.  Everything for a very reasonable price and is often filled with senior citizens (you know it's good!).  Friendly owner and workers...and they do bring your food to you when they call your number.  They also have a patio area to sit outside on a warm night.  I rarely give a 5 star to a restaurant that is not full service, but I will make an exception for this place.  Think of it as a place for great fresh seafood minus the beach view and white table cloths."}
{"text":"If high quality, fresh fish and seafood is what your fishing for, head to the Pier! Oscar's Pier 83 has one of the selections of not only food, and cooking styles, but beverages as well. Along with the typical line of American beers, they also have several smaller brews like Alaskan, and imports from all over. They also serve wine, soda, and bottled water. As for the \"meat\", they have several types of fish, soft shell crabs, oysters, scallops, shrimp and more. Price wise figure about $10 for the average seafood dish. Portion size is not great, but you won't be looking for more either. I was highly impressed with their slaw, and tarter sauce (made with dill!). If a member of your party isn't into food from the sea, Oscar's has a nice menu of sandwiches, and salads. Coming from NY, this is one of the best places to eat if you want some offerings from the sea in the desert."}
{"text":"The style of this restaurant is order at the counter and they bring it to your table. The service was very friendly and fast. The gentleman at the counter offered many suggestions including don't forget to get your 10% off coupon from yelp. No one can say they don't have their beer batter down to a science!  We had fish and chips along with calamari strips and shrimp. All were battered and all were crispy and delicious. Even at the end of the meal when the fries were starting to get cool there was no sogginess or greasiness. They use Cole products here as well as sell bottled beer."}
{"text":"Apparently it's strange to have a fish and chips place in AZ so it was a surprise to my friends to see this one.  Had the fish and chips (cod) with a piece of mahi mahi and catfish.  Cod and mahi mahi was good.  The mahi mahi was a rec from the guy at the counter.  I am not a fan usually but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was moist and not overly dense like I've had before.  Friends got their shrimp tacos.  While they were huge in size, we all agreed it's better when it's made with a corn tortilla (they used a flour one). The 'chips' were the skinny fries and not the thick kind which i liked. Great service.  The guy was very helpful and came to check up on us."}
{"text":"Very good find! Prices are right, food was great with huge portions, service was awesome and speed of service was outstanding.  Atmosphere was great as well. There was three in my party and none of us had been there before. We decided to try it after reading reviews on yelp. Very happy and all of us were very glad we found this little jewel. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Killer fish and shrimp burritos and tacos the chipotle sauce is really good and service is fast"}
{"text":"This was a great find in the West Valley. I eat here regularly and am working my way around the whole menu. I have had the calamari strips which are more like calamari stalks. They are so meaty, sweet and cooked perfectly. Never over cooked. My go to is the fish and chips. I have had both the catfish and the cod. I usually have left overs since I enjoy the cole slaw and can't resist an app. The fish tacos are a weekly special and the first time I ordered two thinking they were the size most commonly served. No skimping on portions here. 1 taco is quite enough to make a meal out of. They also serve a small selection of beer and wine. I almost forgot to mention the staff is always awesome, friendly and super efficient. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The momma wanted to give this place a try back in November, so we did. I think momma might go back but we won't... Too far to drive for the cost, freezing cold dining room, and moderate quality. I really think we would have done better at Long John Silvers.  It pains me to lob a bad review to a local joint, but when I have to peel my fish out of the overly thick, greasy breading to find a total of less than 3 oz of meat inside, for over $12, I can't give any better... And I froze half to death while doing it!"}
{"text":"Clean place, nice employees. Food was ok, got the oysters,hush puppies,and sweet potato fries. Hush puppies rolled too tight and middle was raw. Oysters had too much batter on them and the inside of the batter was raw,so therefore the oysters weren't cooked completely. The nice lady at the ordering counter said that's how they cook their oysters. Batter should of been thinner would of been perfect then. She said she'd tell the cooks. Raw batter on the oysters and mushy hush puppies just aren't my thing! Sweet potato fries were perfect. Might go back, just request thinner batter and longer cooking time for the hush puppies. By the way they charge .50 extra for the hush puppies and $1.00 extra for the sweet potato fries, otherwise you get french fries and Coleslaw."}
{"text":"I discovered Oscar's Pier 83 a few years ago and had a recent chance to go back. In short, it was just as good as I remember.   I had an Oscar's Ultimate Combo plus a soft shell crab. I had them substitute hush puppies and the pasta salad. Wow the seafood pasta salad was delicious. Well worth the nominal charge above coleslaw. The hush puppies were good as usual.   The fried fish here is excellent. As good as you will find anywhere really. What surprised me was how good the chicken was. I liked the chicken strip better than some places that specialize in chicken strips.   The fried oysters are big and juicy. I had an oyster po' boy before so I knew they were great.  The fried shrimp are also excellent. I try and avoid farm raised shrimp since they usually taste bad. I don't know if these were farmed or wild but they were very sweet and clean tasting. Also I have to mention the clam strips were quite good.   About the only thing I didn't like was the calamari. Honestly I'm not a huge fan of squid to begin with, and the way they cut the pieces here into strips, it is especially thick. I thought it was hard to chew. I'd prefer conventional rings. But everything else was good enough, I will still give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Essentially fast food seafood. Mostly deep fried. Was pretty good. I had the Jumbo Combo which includes deep fried scallop, chicken breast, oyster, cod, shrimp, with fries and deep fried clam strips. It was good, not great as if we were in Boston or London but good. Love the fact I can order beer and wine. Decor is simple. People are friendly. The best part is price to taste ratio: the quality for the price is unbeatable. We spent $24 for Jumbo Combo, shrimp taco (which is quite large), beer and soda. I love seafood, eaten seafood all over the world from Vietnam, France, Italy, Baja California, and many more, and this is good food especially landlocked and for the price. Would certainly come again."}
{"text":"Best seafood in Phoenix in a long time. The breading on the fish and shrimp is light and crisp and the fries are crunchy and yummy with malt vinegar. The onion rings a have the perfect balance of onion and breading. My husband loved the clam chowder. The only thing I was not impressed with was the tartar sauce. It had a funky flavor I couldn't nail down. My husband wasn't a fan either. All in all it was great. I love the atmosphere because it was quiet with some light music and the tv had the diamondback's game. Staff was polite and knowledgeable. Will return"}
{"text":"It was a little different then I thought it'd be.   For some reason I thought it was a fancy seafood restaurant but it's definitely more casual. The food here is pretty solid.   It was like the quick grab pier food in San Fran but instead of ocean views you have strip mall views lol.  If you're in the mood for fish and chips or some shrimp. This is a good option.   Portions were solid for the price. It'd be worth exploring other menu options in the future."}
{"text":"I have a wheat allergy which limits my selection at a place like this. I ordered the crab Louie salad and it was delicious!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The best place in town for huge fresh shrimp and  everything on the menu is delicious.   Please try this lit'l neighborhood restaurant you WILL NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"My BF and I tried this for the first time we were super impressed, especially for being people from Washington.   I had the fish sandwich and it was Bomb.com for sure!  My Boyfriend had Fish Tacos and ended up ordering 2nds because he loved them so much. The place gets busy but there is a reason....it is soo worth it.  They even have TV's to watch a game and eat lunch. Annnnd they serve beer at good prices! Definitely worth checking out!  I believe it's family owned because the manager was working the front counter and register with the other employees. Very nice people!  Kudos Oscar's Pier 83!"}
{"text":"Love the Po Boys here and the clam chowder.  It's great having an affordable seafood place in Glendale and this one has been around for a while."}
{"text":"Old lady and I were in the mood for some fish. Found this place on yelp. Right down the street for us. We walked in on a Wednesday, 20% off sandwiches! She got the fishwich (cod sandwich) and I got a shrimp PoBoy. Both sandwiches were great! Fries with the fishwich were hot and crispy. Place is very clean. Very simple. Love it! Found our new fish and chips place we think!"}
{"text":"For a small place almost like fast food the fish I had was very good. Not fancy inside so if you are just looking for good fish to eat in or take out this is the place."}
{"text":"Hubby was looking for something new while we were in the area.  He found this, so we decided to give it a try.  The restaurant is in a strip mall, and not too big.  It's definitely decorated like a fish place, with loads of boat/captain pictures and a gigantic swordfish on the wall.  It wasn't \"fancy\", but it was very clean (including the restrooms, which is a big tell in smaller places).  We ordered at the counter with a very friendly young man, got our drinks and stuff (cocktail sauce, ketchup, forks, spoons, napkins), then sat down.  In a few minutes, the place was packed, and all the tables were full.  We got there just in time!  Our food was brought to us...hubby got the clam chowder, which he said was alright, but he's had better.  He ate it all, though.  Then, the rest of our food was brought over.  Hubby had ordered fried catfish and chips with cole slaw.  His catfish was huge!  He loved it!!  I got the clam strips, hush puppies (one of my favorite things) and cole slaw.  Everything was really tasty!  I have to say, I loved their cocktail sauce, which I dipped everything in.  Plus, everything came to us piping hot!  The cole slaw was nice, cool and refreshing.  If we're in the area, we'd definitely love to come back here again."}
{"text":"After a relaxing float at TruRest we stopped into Oscars for food. Our first time here but definitely not our last! The food was delicious! Super fresh tasting, lots of food and easy, comfortable atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"This place is good. I get the Po-boy with clams. They give you a good amount of clams in your sandwich and the sauce brings it all together. I made the mistake of getting oysters once.. It turns out those are not my thing. I am always happy with the clams though"}
{"text":"Okay.  Start off by getting a fried cod taco w/ fries. If that's not your cup of tea, Then by fish of choice.. id suggest doing a fish and chips combo.  If you've tried both, and somehow don't like either... We can't be friends.  (: Love ya Oscar! 5/5!!!"}
{"text":"The fish is really good! The place is fairly new and for some reason came onto Yelp as a steak eatery. One orders from the menu standing up at the register and it's a little pricey for that type of order but the food is good. They also have alcoholic drinks if you want mix up a beef burger and red wine!"}
{"text":"We were in Arizona for a football game and came across this place. Seafood isn't exactly your first thought in Arizona but glad we stopped. The food was delicious. Fish and chips were good size portions and breaded perfectly. They have a ton of different fish to choose from which is pretty cool. Hush puppies were good as well. Had the strawberry cake for dessert and it was very good! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It totally wasn't what I expected! I had visions of a fish house restaurant stand alone type of place. It's small and amazing, their food was fresh and delicious and the cape hatteras, NC decor reminded me home!!!! Oh and they have beer!!! I loved it take care of these folks you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite fish restaurant in the Valley of the Sun!  I've  been coming to Oscar's Pier 83 for many years and the food is always consistently hot and  delicious! It's only prepared after you order it!  And it is reasonably priced! Also the staff is courteous and helpful! I highly recommend you check it out! I don't think you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in town. Add a soft shell crab for 4.99."}
{"text":"Another find through Yelp that my roommate and I tried out. No disappointment here! I had the catfish and chips, with the last sea bass taco. The catfish was good, the fries are good, the tartar sauce was the only underwhelming part. My roommate liked it though.   The sea bass taco was THE BOMB. I'm definitely sold on the fish tacos here. We will come back for those absolutely. Ty the manager was awesome helping us decide on what to have. The fish was great, the batter was great, definitely a top notch place!"}
{"text":"Excellent! First time here so have only had the shrimp and cod but on both the batter was perfect. The shrimp were jumbo as described and the cod was as good as any I've had. Coleslaw was my favorite kind - creamy. Cocktail sauce where you could tell they actually know that horseradish is essential. Looking forward to a return visit. Prices very reasonable considering the quality. Good food is never cheap and cheap food is never good!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by eating $$$ fried seafood off of paper plates, although this seems to be common in all the seafood joints.  I thought maybe it was just me because others rave about the place but my wife didn't like it either."}
{"text":"If you like fried food this is the place for you. I ordered the fish fry with french fries and it was good. They do serve beer, which goes along well with the fried dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The dishes are a hit and miss. I really enjoy the shrimp Po' boy sandwich. My friend really likes the oyster Po' boy. The fries are really good. Not seasoned and has a very nice potato-y taste (which I like).  However, I don't like the taco special. Too much vegetable mixture, not enough sauce, and too dry."}
{"text":"The fish taco=wow. The service was excellent and the food was ready fast. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since it opened. Their quality, flavor and portions have not changed from the beginning. Clam chowder, OMG. Fish and chips, ditto. Taco, buritto, por boy, all first rate. Oscar, please bring back the lobster roll!!!"}
{"text":"Yes. Everything about it. Just yes to all these questions. Great prices? Delicious authentic seafood? Fantastic clam chowder? perfectly made cod? I wish you guys weren't so far away, but every time I am in the west valley, i will be dining here. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Great seafood restaurant . They have many choices like tacos, All you can and salads. Their specialty is fried fish. Pricing is very good for their Quality. Their Service was fast and cheerful."}
{"text":"Love this place best...Best fish and chips we've had, not greasy, light batter, coleslaw yummy! We have to drive very far to come here but it is definitely worth the trip!!! The manager is so nice always talks to us and will recommend different fish choices and specials!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, fish and chips are done perfectly. If you are in the mood for fish, go here. Not greasy or messy. Golden piping hot steaming fish. Great slaw too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Portions are well worth it. Owner is very friendly and is always there when I've been here. Definitely recommend. Go here NOW and your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"Excellent! This is the best fish and chips! At our table we had cod, carfish, shrimp, xalamari, oysters and clams. They hand bread everything themselves. All 4 of us loved it! Try it once and you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"The best fish in the area! I love the French fries and the coleslaw & the hush puppies!!!!! The place is small but does have outdoor seating, but the offer desserts and adult beverages.  We go there at least once a month!!!  The people there know their foods and very friendly!"}
{"text":"This is the best fish & chips place in town. It reminds me of the UK when I was studying abroad. I love going on Tuesdays for the $3.50 fish tacos - they're huge. I like the combo meals. I also enjoy Oscar's Ultimate Combo because it consists of a little bit of everything: shrimp, calamari strips, cod, chicken strip, oyster, and fried clam strips in addition to fries & coleslaw. It's a whole package of fried goodies. The clam chowder has a good consistency that is not too watery or too thick - just perfect. Food is fantastic, but service is very slow. Be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes or more on busy days.   If you're a Midwestern student, you can get a student discount on your order. Remember to mention that to them at check-out. You can also get 10% off your entire order for checking in on yelp."}
{"text":"Hidden gem that offers tasty seafood. Very friendly and informative staff. The place always packed with regulars during lunch time. A nice couple invite us to sit with them because it was all you can eat catfish Friday and it was so busy. Average about $30 for two and it's not bad for the quality."}
{"text":"The crab cake dinner was exceptional! Have enjoyed grilled Mahi tacos, also delish! Nice little gem in Glendale."}
{"text":"Ordered oyster's & fish to go.What a . Deliciousness. Chowder really tasty also. I think prices are fair for what you get..  be back again"}
{"text":"I will come here again. The food was delicious, and the guy at the counter had tremendous customer service. The food was really good. I did just feel that it was a tad bit over priced. However, the food and customer service was amazing."}
{"text":"This is the very best place for fish. I love just about everything they have. Great service and great food. You can't beat that. I love this place. Prices are just right. Especially love the jumbo fish taco. Will frequent this place for sure."}
{"text":"To sum it up delicious, casual and friendly. I definitely enjoyed every bite of my fish and chips. Not to mention the clam chowder is great too!   Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I'm tough to please when it comes to seafood, probably has something to do with growing up on an island...  I must say that Oscar's is very clean and the staff is extremely friendly and courteous, overall it was a nice experience.  I had the broiled Cod; I would say it's mediocre.  My husband had the Ahi sandwich, which was better than the Cod, but not the best I've had. In both cases you could clearly taste the 'frozen' fish. We got a side of clam chowder to share; it was full of flavor and the best item out of everything we ordered (still not the best I've had...I will say the best in AZ so far).    It seems that the thing to get at Oscar's is the fish and chips.  Frying a fish can make any bad fish taste good so I'll take everyone's word for it.   Not sure what kind of expectations I had, perhaps I NEED to remind myself that we ARE in Arizona.  For what it's worth, my husband seemed to really like it!  My three stars are for 1) a clean restaurant and friendly staff, 2) my husband liked it and 3) the decent clam chowder"}
{"text":"The food is consistent, staff is super chill. It's a great pick for settling your fried food craving."}
{"text":"Best seafood you can find outside of a fine dining restaurant.  Friendly service.  Great interior.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I would eat here every single day if my wife would let me.  Their fish tacos are great!  I haven't had a bad meal here and I doubt I will.  If you enjoy seafood...definitely try this place out.  Oh yeah, its very affordable!"}
{"text":"Nothing that amazing. Coleslaw was really heavy on the mayonnaise an tastes store bought. Fries were crispy but didn't get much fish"}
{"text":"Nice little yummy & reasonably priced seafood joint. Try the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl- you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars! Just go... I love the deep fried shrimp! The big combo plate is underpriced as far as I'm concerned. As for the post that compared Oscars to Long John Silvers? Seriously lol  That probably means Taco Bell is favorite for Mexican food too. My Mom had a hamburger there and loved it. They have the best Cole slaw, creamy but not watery and ice cold. I love the condiment bar and appreciate the silverware dispensary. Very Sanitary. Restrooms are spotless and thanks to the employees and owners! We are always welcomed and thanked! The owners take pride in their restaurant and it shows! Great Job! And try dipping the shrimp in a little Hot chili sauce! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great stuff!!   Oscar's is a small, but very clean little place. Located in a strip mall in the Arrowhead area. The guy at the counter was very nice, which in my book is a huge plus. It's no frills either. Order at the counter and get your own drink, (plastic) silverware, condiments, etc. Sit down and they bring your food to you. Most of the fare is fried so I don't think I'll be going here every day...or every week for that matter.  However, the food was great. Really good. My GF had fish tacos and fries. She said they were \"excellent\". The sauce they put on the tacos had a little kick to it. I had some cod and fried shrimp with a small cup of clam chowder. All were very good.   Yep, I'm a fan and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best fried fish I've had around here. Husband didn't care for the coleslaw. Chowder was great too! Staff is super nice. I recommend the cod basket"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop by this place for over a year.  Thankfully I was in the area and it happened to be around lunch time...  The place is tastefully decorated and you definitely feel like your in for a seafood treat.  The man who took our order was friendly, we told him this was our first time and he suggested we try the clam chowder, which we did and it was very good.  We got the Cod and clam strips combo.  Shrimp PO' boy.  1 giant fried shrimp.  The fish is a standout, fresh tasting, cooked to perfection.  The giant fried shrimp was also noteworthy.    I seriously am craving this place and wish they were closer.  Best fish and chips around!!"}
{"text":"This place was not what I expected based on the other reviews. The pictures posted were a little misleading. But this turned out to be a locals hidden gem.  The patio is dog friendly and that brought my review up to 4 stars for a small place that looks better for take out.  I agree with most of the other reviewers the sourdough clam chowder bowl was awesome. the crab Louie salad was great, everything was fresh. There was real crab and a lot of it.  Three of us shared and there was some left over. I had the fried assortment, it was very filling and I had a lot of leftovers.  All in all I would not search this place out but if you're near it's definitely a place to eat."}
{"text":"Have lived in many states where the seafood goes directly from the boat to the kitchento your plate in minutes, not days, and this place can hang with the best of them. My girlfriend grew up in Alaska and she loved the food here. I had the clam Po-Boy and there was enough clam on it to make it hard to close. My new go to place for that seafood craving."}
{"text":"Had a really great seafood lunch here back in March. Left hungry though, very pricey and not filling."}
{"text":"Love this place.  If you love fried clams.. Best in town.  No heavy batter on fried fish.. More like tempura.  Have broiled fish also.  Service great.. People very personable.. Reminds me of a family neighborhood restaurant with great food.   Have found NOTHING on the menu I don't like.... :-)"}
{"text":"IMHO, San Diego has the best fish spots on the west coast. This place is just as good as anything I've had there. Burgers and Chicken tenders are good too.(My kids don't do fish)  Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  We tried just about everything on this menu and was excited over everything!!! I wanted more and more. I was stuffed and I still wanted more!! I came back the next day by myself to sneak in a meal. Shhhhh don't tell the wife . But halibut, cod, shrimp, oysters, clams, I mean it all was spot on dang good!! Very very impressed and I can't wait to come back. Even writing this my mouth is waters and I might even droll on my phone!! If you like Fried seafood and its lightly fried and NOT oily what so ever go here. If you don't like it something is wrong with your taste buds seriously! Okay I'm going tomorrow now because thinking about it all after this review I have to!"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday, husband ordered cod sandwich and complained there was too much fish! LOL. I had the fish and shrimp combo, very good and fresh."}
{"text":"Last minute choice for dinner based on the 4.5 star rating... so thrilled we opted to try it. We are already planning out next trip back. The food was amazing and the staff was fabulous."}
{"text":"Their fish tacos are delicious, check them out every Tuesday for their fish taco special absolutely amazing. Best. Was I've had"}
{"text":"If you want a casual restaurant for tasty seafood, this is the place. Glad we checked it out. The mahi mahi taco is delicious. The clam chowder is excellent. The service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Five stars for the fish.  Fries and coleslaw? Not so great.  Worth checking it out.   The Pier 83 in the name must be something personal to Oscar.  The Restaurant is not on a Pier, and it is not on 83rd Street or 83rd Avenue. Like most restaurants in the Phoenix metro, it is in a strip mall. Order and pay at the counter when you walk in, get a number and they bring your food out to you. Beer and wine are available, no hard liquor.   I was thinking of getting fish tacos, but decided on Fish-n-Chips with the standard Icelandic Cod instead. The fish was delicious. Very lightly fried with a moist and flaky filet. If I was just eating the fish this review might have gotten the extra star. However, the coleslaw was dry and bland. Maybe it is my personal preference, but I prefer thick cut skin-on fries with my Fish-n-Chips. These fries reminded me of what you get at McDonald's or Burger King, but not that good.   My dining companion said the fish tacos were the best ever. I'll be trying those next year if I make it back there."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner tonight on the phone. It was ready in 10 minutes! We loved the shrimp poorboys"}
{"text":"I popped in here with a coupon because it was the last opportunity I had to check it out before heading out of town.  Everyone else in my family hates seafood, so I ditched 'em for this trip.  The owner was ringing people up, and was quite pleasant and personable.  I barely beat the lunch rush so it was busy but never got out-of-hand.   They had no issues making substitutions for my food allergies. When I received my tuna, it was cooked perfectly.  The mixed veggies could have been hotter but the fries were great.  They have free refills on fountain drinks and teas. Alcoholic beverages available. In the cold case by the register you can purchase take-home size containers of their signature tartar and chipotle sauces or desserts.   The best testament to the quality of the food served? Employees sitting at the tables on break eating there, too."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips for the price in Phoenix. The clam chowder is amazing. The Atmosphere isn't very extravagant and is a order at the counter deal. But overall had a good experience. I will go back."}
{"text":"Foods great, but just wish the prices were a bit cheaper. Otherwise I'll be here more often."}
{"text":"Where does this place get their fish from?  Is there a dock out back?  Read my review for more....  Location & Aesthetics - located on corner of N 59th Ave & W Union Hills Drive, in the same compound as CVS Pharmacy.  In fact, the restaurant is right behind it, and isn't difficult to miss, with good signage. There's lots of parking in the surrounding parking lots though not too many directly in front of the restaurant as the restaurant does share parking (in front) with other businesses.   Lots of seating within the restaurant and outside though I didn't notice the presence of misters for folks sitting outside. The restaurant was very clean -- floors and tables.  Adequate light from outside.  Music levels weren't too loud and there were two flat-screened TV's tuned to sports channels which was muted.  Menus - located above the cashier, where your order is also placed.  Very easy to read and comprehend.  Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming.  We were greeted when we came in. Staff answered any questions we had about the menu, and even made recommendations which was much appreciated. When you're ordering to dine in, staff (very friendly) will bring your food to you and ask if there's any sauces or extra condiments you'd like (a variety of condiments available on the table too).  Food - I had the broiled Atlantic salmon which came with \"fresh vegetable medley\" and \"homemade seafood pasta salad\". First off, the fresh vegetable medley was actually steamed vegetables and they were very fresh, not soggy at all, but very crunchy and served hot! The seafood pasta salad really tasted like it was homemade -- lots pasta, shrimp, and pieces of lobster meat with green beans, and served slightly chilled as it should be! The Atlantic salon was fresh like it was just caught, brought in from the dock, cleaned, and immediately placed in whatever apparatus you use for broiling stuff -- a broiler?  It was served hot, well seasoned (not over/under seasoned), soft, tender, and moist, not dry.  When cutting into it, it wasn't breaking apart on the fork which I think fish should being consumed, but that's me. Truly a savory dish!!!  If you check in with your Yelp app, there's 10% off your order so be sure to check in! I like that fact that they have all-you-can-eat fish-days.  I believe it's on Sunday (catfish) and everyday (tilapia) which is something I'm highly interested in. I most definitely will be back to eat here.  I can't say how much I loved the broiled dish I had today, and would love to try other broiled options like the Mahi Mahi or Pacific cod, and many others on their menu. I'll also like to return to sample their many and varied fried dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Great fried cod.  Just a little place.  Not a lot in ambiance but the food and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Great place for fish and chips getting Oscar's ultimate platter and a 2 piece cod with sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my family because we felt like fish and the valley lacks any selection of fish restaurants. Thankfully, Oscar's Pier 83 is very good.  I ordered the 2 piece cod fish and chips and my wife had the tilapia fish and chips. We shared so we could both sample some of their offerings.  Both meals were cooked to perfection. The tilapia was soft and tasty while the cod was meaty and also flavorful.   The staff was polite and the table service was a nice treat especially considering that I was expecting a more fast food experience. I was also very excited that they were happy to alter our order after it was placed because we had forgotten to upgrade to steak fries and sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries were a nice treat because I normally hate sweet potato but the few my wife fed me were very delectable.   The coleslaw was good and I enjoyed the cocktail sauce as well.  Overall I would rate this as a very good place for a quick meal for lunch or dinner. I would happily return to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I visited Oscar's for the first time about two weeks ago. My boyfriend has been a patron for years. The vibe is very casual. You go to the counter to order and then they bring your food out to your table. I ordered some type of fish taco ($6 I think?) and my boyfriend ordered the Oscar's Ultimate Combo ($17.99) which included 2 jumbo shrimp, 2 calamari strips. 2 pieces of cod, 1/4 lb friend clam strips, fries, and coleslaw. We shared each other's meals and while his was tasty I thought my fish taco was better because of the sauce. :)  I do have to say that out of all of the sea food places I have tried in Phoenix this has been my favorite so far. The staff was very friendly, the prices are decent, and the food tasted outstanding. Shout out to Oscar's for being so rad. :)"}
{"text":"Have been all AROUND Arizona... for a land locked state. Oscar's has just what I need. No Salt Lick RED Lobster.  So to our Surprise we bought a house one block south literally in bicycle distance.  We are in trouble in 2015."}
{"text":"I've  been here a few times now and I obviously continue to go back because although small and not in a easily viewed location, it's simply and consistently delicious. I've  lived in the coast so have an issue eating seafood not being close to the water. The place is always clean, customer service is always impeccable. Food is #Fantastic and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Food was great! However I hate eating great food when the owner was a jerk. The cooks lost an order ( not mine) which coming from 15 years in the industry happens at lunch time. No biggie. To top it off it was an older lady who was obviously on her work lunch break. The lady asks the owner if she should wait (this place is counter service) and he turns and looks at her and snaps \"staring at me isn't going to make it faster!\" Wow... Great food.... Horrible ownership (FYI he wears a name tag stating \"owner\")"}
{"text":"Apparently this place has been in business for 10 years but we just discovered it.  I had the combo basket which consisted of cod, clams, shrimp, oyster, chicken, and scallops.  I always see a plate like this as the ultimate test of a restaurants commitment to quality as most times they will cook everything together so most of the items are overcooked. Not the case here, everything was fresh and cooked to perfection.  I actually let out a faint moan when I tried the scallop.   My wife had a cup of clam chowder which was very good and we split an order of Hush Puppies that were nice and crispy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside.  My only wish is that we had found this place sooner."}
{"text":"Pier 83 is my favorite fish restaurant in Arizona! They have a variety to choose from the menu,but I'm mostly interested in the fish tacos and fish sandwiches. You can get them fried or broiled depending on how healthy you want the meal to be. The sandwiches also come in a variety of different fish like ahi tuna is my personal favorite or cod, and to make it even more healthy and Tasty, I get sweet potato fries instead of regular. This place is one of my favorites restaurants all time"}
{"text":"Quick easy seafood! The fried clams and cod are amazing I could eat my weight in the clams they are not tuff or chewy, just perfect!"}
{"text":"It's just ok. We shared the fish and chips and grilled mahi sandwich. Fish was not very crispy and the mahi wasn't well seasoned. If we give it another try the fried shrimp looked yummy."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff! We ordered the fried oysters + chips and the fried shrimp + fish and chips. They actually got my order wrong and gave me the oysters + fish and chips, but I didn't realize it until I got home. The seafood was great, but the fries weren't anything special. The coleslaw was also average, but the seafood pasta salad was tasty. The shrimp were huge and not overly breaded, same with the oysters. It was a little pricey for the amount of food but it is fish that seems to be pretty high quality. I would probably come back!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a low key seafood restaurant and I've finally found it. Fish and chips were some of the best I've had. Clam chowder was excellent as well."}
{"text":"This was a great experience! I ordered the sourdough bowl and clam chowder. The bread was undeniably fresh and soooo delicious, and the soup was just as amazing. The facility was clean and the staff was nice. We ordered our food and in less than 10 minutes they were bringing it out. It was quite busy there, and it's a little on the pricier side for lunch stuff, but the food was worth it. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Being from a place where fresh fish is available I was skeptical ordering the fish tacos and didn't have high hopes. I was pleasantly surprised, it wasn't the best fish, but good for Arizona standards. Went there on a Tuesday and got the \"Taco Tuesday\" special."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I had the cod and shrimp combo. They were cooked to perfection , possibly the best I have ever had and the fries and slow were excellent as well.  I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in Phoenix! I can't remember who recommended this place to us but wow, they are owed a thank you. We had the traditional fish and chips and a shrimp po boy. I don't remember ever having such fresh fried fish. The po boy had so many shrimp that they were falling out.   It was a Tuesday about 2 and it was packed. Tells you it's a great place! We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Bought lunch for my family visiting from WA.  Had soggy red snapper.  Bill was over $90!.  For lunch.  Will never go back.  I was totally embarrassed."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! Had never been here, but we'll be regulars from now on!!!! So fresh and good! The seafood pasta salad is amazing!! So is the clam chowder."}
{"text":"Best cocktail sauce I've had outside of a high end steakhouse!!  It's the real \"atomic\" kind where you get the horseradish burn in your nose...love it!!  The shrimp are HUGE and you can tell they are fresh...we will be back for more."}
{"text":"Yum! Definitely did not expect DELICIOUS fish n' chips in the desert!  I LOVE the fry of all the fish here... does not taste oily and as heavy as you would expect fish n' chips to be. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I've had fish that was much tastier (super fresh) but if you gave these guys a fresh caught fish, they'd be the perfect ones for the job!  I tried:  cod & 1/2 lb clam strips + seafood pasta -This is a good amount of food for what you pay for. -The clams weren't AMAZING but pretty decent -Cod fry was not oily and very juicy inside. It's just missing some flavoring (maybe not super fresh like you'd get at places by the coast, but very good for AZ!) -I wished they had a lighter side other than seafood pasta (or cole slaw) that's mixed w/ mayo? It definitely got too heavy after a while. In fact, the fried cod tasted lighter than this pasta!   catfish n' chips -I was hoping the fries would be the thicker fries (like steak) but they're not (they're like McD's size)... so didn't reach my usual expectations of \"chips\" -I personally really like catfish so I really liked this one a lot. Crunchy & not oily. Although again, no extra seasoning on catfish, but I'm ok w/ that since I like catfish & it has a more pronounced flavor than cod   Definitely looking forward to coming back here! I feel like this is probably the best fish n chips in town... but in an overall scheme, they're solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Love the clam chowder bread bowl!! Delicious and filling. Amazing spot. The tacos are ahhhmazing. :)"}
{"text":"This is the best place for fried seafood.  Being from New England, it's difficult to find decent fried fish.  The fried haddock dinner is outstanding. I would really like if they did some sort of daily special. I.e lobster roll."}
{"text":"I have such a wonderful meal at Pier 83 yesterday. I ordered the clam chowder soup which was excellent and a crab Louie salad. The salad came with a really a delicious homemade dressing and the tomatoes tasted like real tomatoes.  And of course the crab salad was great. But the desserts oh my gosh golly. I ordered a small strawberry Bundt cake. They are all homemade and tasted fabulous. Pier 83 had eight or 9 varieties of small homemade bundt cakes.  Lastly I'm an iced tea drinker and Pier 83 has iced tea that truly tastes like iced tea, not the week stuff you purchase at most restaurants.  My only regret was that I spent some money there and did not use my 10% discount from Yelp so be sure to take advantage when you try this restaurant. It's the only Pier 83 in town.  Back again one week later and again forgot to use my 10% discount. On Tuesdays they have $5 fish tacos so I ordered one. The flour tortilla was light and fresh as well as the fish. Also couldn't forget The clam chowder and the crab Louie salad and two homemade Bundt cakes one strawberry and the other was lemon blueberry.  Staff is very friendly and helpful. Give it a try.???"}
{"text":"Definite casual dining option. Cod fish sandwich, sweet potato fries, clam chowder were all well prepared and tasty.  A few beers available in addition to tea and soda drinks. Food specials each night.  Staff friendly and customer oriented."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for the past 2 years.  I found this place while looking for clam chowder on google.  I decided to try it out and I have no regrets.  The chowder was satisfying. Although, there was a time when the chowder tasted kind of buttery(?). The flavor was kind of off, but nevertheless, I decided to try other items on the menu and ended up going back for their calamari, fish tacos, their sandwiches and salads.  I have tried their all you can eat fish & fries, BUT the fish seems to lack flavor.  It's quite bland.  While my brother was visiting from out of state last year, I treated him to a meal there.  He ordered the fish & fries, and he also felt like the fish could use more seasoning.  Maybe, they can season it with the seasoning stuff they use on the fries.  Idk. Just a thought."}
{"text":"The biggest and best Fish Tacos in the state! They are huge and cheap for what you get.  Love the catfish, cod, shrimp, and clams.  Ill try them all one day.  This place is better then some places I have been to on the coast.  If you like this place sign up for their texts alerts so you know when specials are or limited time items."}
{"text":"Best shrimp and fish n chips on the westside!!!! We love this place and when ever we want sea food we go to Pier 83. Five Stars"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim. We werent looking for another chain spot. We were not disappointed. The Food was good. Fries were really good"}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch special. Succulent broiled fish taco with extra cabbage and side salad substituted for fries. I love a place that is so nice about working with my food allergies...and it tastes great!"}
{"text":"Finally a seafood restaurant worthy of the name! Small but clean with friendly staff, Wife and I stopped in for our 1st visit and as ol' Arnold said WE'LL BE BACK!! Tried the two piece Cod fish n chips they were hot,moist,and tender to the point they almost fell apart ,a bit bland but that's the nature of Cod next time will be trying the Haddock... the chips (fries) were hot. Crisp and delicious and not the least bit greasy. Also another thing is full menus to take with you in a rack by the front door."}
{"text":"Looking for something different, found this place on Yelp with good reviews. Food was very good, fresh, just a bit pricey."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the broiled cod with double vegetables. Also ordered tilapia w/vegetables and fish & chips. Everything was excellent. I loved the tartar sauce!"}
{"text":"I had the oysters with fish it was more than enough food with the large oysters. Mailed it will return soon i need more pier 83."}
{"text":"We were in the area and looking for a place to have dinner, pulled Yelp and searched for places near by and this place came so we decided to give it a try and what a pleasant surprise truly a hidden gem. Every thing about this restaurant is AWESOME!!!!!!! The food, service everything about this place spectacular. I ordered their Monday special which is humongous fish taco, crab cake, mounds of calamari  strips and shrimp cocktail all for $14 and some change my wife had their fish special and it was awesome too. We will definitely be making special trips to this restaurant from Anthem. Everybody on yelp who are bitching about the prices at this restaurant you pay for quality specialy in desert you have to pay premium for good quality sea food CAPISH!!!! For you cheap skates I believe there are still some Long John Silver open go get your sea food fix over there."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in town . Jumbo shrimp and new england style clam chowder are excellent as well ."}
{"text":"This was are first time. The place was clean. The patio is a nice size, just wish it had misters. Very limited in seating on the inside. Service friendly and fast. Shrimp was good. My family had the fish they weren't super impressed. It didn't have any flavor."}
{"text":"New favorite place? I think so. I've only tried the Baja style cod fish taco and it was so good. I will definitely have to try everything else."}
{"text":"Great food and the only place, in the middle of the desert, I know around here to get great fish n chips and shrimp n chips. We eat here about once a month and we'll definitely be back.   If I had one suggestion, it would be to fry the fries longer or double fry them. I'm personally not a big fan of limp fries.   All in all this place is really good."}
{"text":"Yummy hot food. Casual dinning. Staff greeted us at door and where egar to help. For a quick bite of something made to order it was good."}
{"text":"First timers and it was delish!!! Damn it was so good! I got the shrimp taco, huge by the way! Wifey got the cod taco and we split the calamari. Awesome!!!! Found them on yelp and so glad we stopped in. The staff was absolutely amazing. So friendly and just literally 5 star customer service. Prices are very reasonable also. We'll be back and are already looking forward to it."}
{"text":"We sure enjoyed our fish and chip combos with shrimp and clams. Excellent food and a nice clean little restaurant.  We are glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Oscar's Pier 83 has to be the best place in Phoenix for fried fish. This is my 5th? 6th trip and I haven't come close to having even an average meal! They have ALL been exceptional! I usually get the Cod but the  Catfish is exceptional too. Tender moist and flavorful every time. The sides are even amazing. Fries, crisp and golden brown with that tender core, perfect. The Hush puppy's  have great flavor as does the Cole Slaw. The Tarter sauce is very good and the Chilpotle Ranch is so good I end up looking around to see of anyone is watching me lick the container dry. This place deserves your  consideration anytime you think of having fish, or a meal out or just any excuse!! EAT MORE FISH!  P.S. I am not an employee or friend, just a guy hungry for Good fish!!"}
{"text":"Best fast food seafood restaurant in town. I lived in Boston and have eaten seafood all up and down the east coast from Portland Maine south. Ambiance nothing to look at but very clean. Location in a inconspicuous strip mall. $3.50 fish tacos are worth the price with 2 large strips of fish inside. Some people would say this is expensive but you get what you pay for and you never want to eat cheap seafood! It's worth visiting"}
{"text":"It was pretty good considering it's a small fast food place. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Got the all you can eat Tilapia. Delicious, crispy, not overly battered.  Tarter sauce is perfect, with some malt vinegar and lemon juice.  The pasta salad is always good here, and today is no exception.   I wish they had Styrofoam cups instead of paper so it would keep my drink cold longer and make the ice last longer in drinks."}
{"text":"Best seafood in Phoenix! This place is great. Everything tastes very fresh and they have a cool selection of craft beers to try!"}
{"text":"Don't let the casual atmosphere fool you....this place has quality fish and seafood. Pretty much anything you want from the water, mostly fried but some grilled. Occasionally brings in specialty items like walleye. Fish tacos are awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered the fried cod fish, jumbo shrimp and new England clam chorder. The chorder was delicious and buttery. The batter for the cod and shrimp is perfect light and non-greasy. The only let down was the fries  they didn't measure up to the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"Came here tonight around 6:30pm for some fish and chips with my family. The place was PACKED but it makes me really happy to see that! This place deserves it! We did have to wait for a table for a little while but finally got one and our food was delivered a short time after we were able to sit down. We love this place and don't come enough!! The employees are top notch too!"}
{"text":"Well, I say this place is a big winner and usual stop for me, especially after donating blood right next door. the Crab Louie salad is a fav for me but I know a lot of people are into the fish and chips here. no matter what the choice , services is Grand and the owners are phenomenal people . don't miss out on this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fish joint in the city ,hands down.great decor great service.I love the different fish of the day variety they have,I'm always asking for the red snapper which os tough to come by,I've eaten at least 8 different items & all were fantastic ,very well cooked.I love this place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for fish n chips! I've been coming here for years and I'm never disappointed. I've taken out-of-town friends to Oscar's and they raved about how tasty the meals were. (These friends were from San Diego & certainly wouldn't have trouble finding fresh seafood back home. They loved Oscar's).   I usually order the cod fillet (sometimes tilapia) with coleslaw, fries, hush puppies, and a beer. The menu is moderately priced w/ fish, shrimp, chowders, & more, the restaurant is clean, and staff is friendly. I love the nautical sea-shack vibe of my favorite little seafood place. In fact, this is my go-to spot for fresh, hot fish that melts in my mouth. Will be a long time customer!"}
