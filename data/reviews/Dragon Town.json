{"text":"Dragon Town offers a wide variety of delicious food with lots of flavor! I like the fact that they offer both traditional Chinese food, as well as some Thai dishes.  We have both dined inside the restaurant and ordered takeout, and the service has been excellent.  A definite improvement in food quality and service from the previous establishment!  We're glad to have a tasty Chinese restaurant in Bellevue!"}
{"text":"Came here with family for a late lunch. Clean, friendly and affordable BUT not worth a return visit. Food was tasteless, warm but had a nice presentation. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. We were the only ones in the restaurant  (should have been a clue) service was very slow (especially being the only ones there) the food all tasted the same. Like grease from the stove. GROSS!!! Nothing was good!! I would never go back!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite delivery Chinese.best crab Rangoon I've found and they always include extra sauce."}
{"text":"The first time I went there, all I had was won ton soup and I didn't think much of it. But then my boyfriend and I went back one day for general tso chicken, and it was INCREDIBLE. We order out from here at least once a week / bi-weekly. It doesn't hurt that they're located on the main strip of Bellevue, and their staff are super friendly. Best chinese food in Bellevue!"}
{"text":"The service at Dragon Town is quite pleasant. Came in today after passing the restaurant in the car yesterday and I'm glad I did. The prices are fair and portion sizes are great. Free delivery is also nice if you live nearby! Will definitely come back and highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in the area. I love, love, love their hot and sour soup. They even garnish it with crispy fried noodles. They have excellent food from crab Rangoon to cashew chicken to yummy fried rice. Everything always arrives hot and in a reasonable delivery time.  Excellent customer service too!"}
{"text":"I have been sick as hell every since i ate that fried rice. It was the only thing i ate the day before yesterday. Im laying in bed still not able too eat. Stomach upset want too vomit but i can. Been in the bathroom all night. I normally wouldnt write a really bad review but this business really has hurt me. Be careful. Would call and complain but im too sick."}
{"text":"I FINALLY found some excellent chinese food close to home. I placed an order for delivery and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived [ very quick delivery]  it was still piping hot. I was thrilled with the first bite. Steaming egg drop soup, lo mein, shrimp toast, crab rangoons, and egg rolls. Every bite either met or exceeded my expectations. Would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Yikes. Gave them a second chance today, and it was bad. Hot and sour soup was actually sludge. Sludge. Everything else was bland. Paid $15, and all I could eat was a little chicken and \"fried\" rice.  People taking the order were nice, as was delivery lady."}
{"text":"First On my way! Trying since it changed ownership from Uncle Chen's. It didn't disappoint! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered through Yelp Eat 24 Saturday night and while the delivery was quick, I realized too late that I was given the wrong order. I would have been fine with this because I typically will eat any Chinese dish, however the dish I got instead was not even appetizing enough to eat. Please check your orders more carefully before making them."}
{"text":"The food is always good but there is just no reason why my delivery should take an hour.  I live less than a mile away, and this long of a wait is just insane.  Last time it took 75+minutes.  This time it's been over an hour as well. Please work on your delivery times.  I called to ask why this takes so long and the woman said it takes an hour from when the driver gets there at 11.  Then why did you tell me at 1045 if would be an hour?  Will not be ordering delivery ever again.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! And the price is certainly right! The wonton soup was more beef broth than chicken and had a hint of spice. The wonton dumplings were huge and amazing! I would've liked a few more but I was being greedy. The vegetable mai fun...holy crap. Crack in the sauce! We also got crab Rangoon but they weren't for me haha but they looked and smelled delicious. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. What I had was honestly better than the other Chinese takeout in the area. I just wish the Amazing Chicken had a bit more crunch to it. But other than that, pretty good. I'll try it again!"}
{"text":"The pork egg rolls are delicious. However, I have a hard time ordering and getting through. Sometimes it feels like more of a hassle to order from here than it would to drive farther to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Today I ordered General Tso's Tofu and it was SO GOOD. Most Chinese take out places serve really awful tasting tofu but this was awesome. It was crispy on the outside and super juicy on the inside. The sauce wasn't anything special, a little on the sweet side but i liked it. I also got a veggie egg roll which was just okay. Nice & crunchy, but almost no filling inside. They have a decent amount of vegetarian options here."}
{"text":"Dragon  Town a must try in Bellevue PA.  The owner is personable and provides excellent service,  Introducing herself to her customers.  The food was exceptionally fresh with a beautiful presentation.  They have taken the familiar menu items to a whole new level.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"So I had high hopes for this Chinese restaurant. I thought maybe finally we got a good Chinese restaurant in Bellevue. Well I was wrong. It was horrible food. The wonton soup dumplings were soggy and the egg roll was gummy not crispy. I ordered the donuts which I was really disappointed in. A soggy doughy mess. The fried rice and lomein was bland. Never again will I order from here and nor do I recommend. I called to give feedback and all they could say was \" oh well we will try to Improve the next time\". Well there will not be a next time for me"}
{"text":"The crab rangoons were fine. Edible. Not very flavorful. The chow mein tastes good but the main reason for the low rating is that I specifically asked if they gave crispy noodles, they said yes, and they gave me the smallest bag I've ever seen that was half full. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed"}
{"text":"I would like to give 3.5 stars.  This was our first visit since the new owners took over.  We met someone who appeared to be one of the owners.  He was extremely friendly and seemed very excited about his new venture.  I really wanted to love the food here, but it was just Okay. I have definitely had worse Chinese food.  I got the sesame chicken.  There seemed to be a flavor that I wasn't use to being in this dish.  It took me off guard,  but I did get use to it.  The chicken wasn't really the problem, and based on that alone, I would give it 4 stars.   Unfortunately the fried rice was just so -so, but cost an extra dollar.   It's definitely the best place for Chinese in the nearby area and I will be eating there again.  When I do,  I'll be getting the white rice and saving a dollar.  I'm hoping that next time,  I can give a better rating."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here (the restaurant is 2 miles from my house) and it took 90 freaking minutes. The restaurant originally quoted an hour and 15 minutes past that time, I had to contact the restaurant to find out where my food was. When the food arrived, it was mostly cold. I contacted the restaurant for a discount and they refused.   The food was okay, but I couldn't really tell because it was COLD. I would not order from here again, especially with their terrible customer service. If you're looking for great Chinese food - I recommend Sesame Inn (Ross), Chinatown Inn (Downtown), or How Lee (Squirrel Hill). Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I have no idea what people are complaining about.  This is very good Chinese food, which is always hard to come by.  The General Tsos was perfectly crispy, the honey chicken wasn't overly sweet, and the garlic broccoli was perfect.  And delivery was fast and on-time.  I absolutely will order here from now on!"}
