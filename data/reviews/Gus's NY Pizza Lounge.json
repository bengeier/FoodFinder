{"text":"These guys gave my pizza to someone else without a second thought! There was a WWE RAW show going on and the manager had such a hard on for the girls wrastling that he didn't even care that people were getting the wrong pizzas. No apologies at all. They sent my pizza off with someone else and said nothing. Just ducked their heads and took another 20 minutes making mine after I came in for a pickup. Nice customer service! They don't even give you red pepper or parm! Who does that?!? Fuggetabout it!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and this place looked intresting, it was clean, ( a major plus in my  search for food places) i got my pizza quick, i ordered a veggi, and the veggies were fresh and overall the pizza was yummy!!! but it was HUGE!!!  but the atmospher was fun, great to meet people, where you can actuly hear them.  overall i would totaly recomend and will totaly go there. i was talking to the guy at the counter, and heard that it was under new ownership , so maybe thats why my experience was diffrent then the rest."}
{"text":"Was treated to Gus's last night after a basketball game. Tried so many so called New York Style Pizzas. I can honestly say that this is how I remember NY pizza. You can instantly tell that the quality of ingredients are top notch and the crust is the key, they nailed it. I live in Tempe but will definitely be making a pizza run to Scottsdale. Thanks for doing what you do."}
{"text":"The pizza is your typical NY thin crust pizza and they usually have a variety to choose from.  This pizza usually hits the spot after a night out.  However, the only reason I rated two stars is due to this being the 3rd time(6mnths) of me being stiffed by charging me $32 for two slices of pizza.  *remember to keep your receipts so they don't include their own tip!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I have ever received.  After 4 calls and 1.5 hours of not receiving our pizza we were finally told that it had been delivered to the wrong residence and we would have to wait another 1 hr.  It was the absolute worst service that we could be offered.   I recommend fast food before I recommend Gus's and I HATE fast food. 

Signed,"}
{"text":"absolute bullshit, ordered food for delivery, the damn driver called me countless times and couldnt find my place somehow...IF YOU OFFER DELIVERY, MAKE SURE YOUR DRIVERS CAN LOCATE WHERE THEY NEED TO DELIVER TO
that is all."}
{"text":"After an hour and half I finally received my food. I received raw, uncooked fries and boiling hot soda. No ketchup, was charged a deliver fee and the deliver man ask for a tip. HE ASK!!! I would never again order from this place."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza around 8PM on a Saturday. No more than 5 minutes after I placed my order I called back and cancelled my order. I was assured that I would not be charged and to have a great night. 

Fast forward to when I received my credit card statement and was surprised to see a charge for pizza I never received. I called Gus and calmly explained that there had been an error and my card was incorrectly charged. I provided my cell phone number and the date of the charge. 

When she asked for the CC number I explained that my card had been stolen since this charge and I don't have access to that number anymore. She then accused me of lying and asked if I even remembered ordering the pizza. I asked if there was any other way that this could be looked up as it seemed a bit weird that the ONLY information they would choose to keep on file would be my CC number. She then went on about how it seemed a bit fishy to her that I wouldn't have it and that it sounded like I had a lot of money if I was willing to front my credit card being stolen. WHAT DOES THAT EVENT MEAN?! 

Let's be real. This pizza I never got was only 31.75. However, the way this employee spoke to me was incredibly disrespectful and inappropriate. I told her she could take up her concerns with Discover and opened a case where Gus will now have to prove delivery. I've never had this pizza and after this experience you can guarantee I never will."}
{"text":"What a filthy smelly dump. The place looks like  the food tastes.....awful... Horrid disgusting foul garbage served by obnoxious barely literate trash. I would rather eat a handful of dog sh**. I will never ever consider going back.  Steer clear of this place unless you enjoy a high likelihood of food poisoning. Apparently I'm not the only person who feels like this. The place is empty always... always. Look at the other stunning reviews they get... do yourself a favor.... Go to JOE'S."}
{"text":"Gyro is HORRIBLE! All lettuce no meat! If I wanted a salad that is what I would have ordered! Never again!"}
{"text":"We got a small pizza French fries and a chicken salad delivered.  He told us 15 then was an hour.  The French fries and pizza we're disgustingly cold.  Then to top of off the driver says what no tip when they tack on a $6 delivery.  Had the food been hot maybe we would have tipped more.  How rude and nasty I will not recommend nor eat there ever again!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, we called and miraculously our pizza got to us 3 hours later! We called not once but 4 times asking where our order was and received the same answer of \"It'll be there shortly\". When it finally came half of it was spilled on the sidewalk and I refused to pay for a cold pizza. The wings that the delivery guy took (since they were half on the ground) with him ended up splattered all over our back fence. Very classy and a nice touch to a terrible experience."}
{"text":"It took them an hour and a half (literally) to deliver a pizza on a Tuesday night- I was told I would get my pizza in about 45 minutes. I was about to get in my car and go get other food because they took such a ridiculously long time. I had to call them 3 times to see when I would be getting my food. I am extremely irritated and will never ever order from this terribly run business again. I highly recommend Chizona's Pizza (in Scottsdale) or Oreganos Pizza (never a let down)."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE!!!!

We ordered online through EatStreet for Gus's a meatball sub and a Philly cheese steak with a cheese fry with the cheese on the side.

We enter our location and room number but still received a call from Gus's for the room number and the location of our hotel.

The order arrived cold and incorrect! We err given an Italian sub and steak sub with raw veges on both.....

We called the store and was told that what is written on the container \"Italian\" is not what's inside the styrofoam box is a meatball sub. I asked for the food to be remade and sent out but upon arrival the meatball sub was cold and literally had three meatballs cut in half and placed on an extra large roll that was burnt and hard.

The next mornings we drove the .7 miles to Gus's and the day manager stated that we had to speak with the night manager. I left my business card but never heard from anyone.

I have never had such horrible service in all my life and to be blown off my management as though my complaint is not worthy of a phone call!"}
{"text":"Living in the Valley for over 10 years and had pizza everywhere BUT Gus's until tonight.  Being from the East Coast we know what good pizza is!  What a wasted 10 years of eating so called \"good\" pizza.  Not to say every place out here is not ok, but Gus's absolutely rocks.  If you want non-bubble gum cheese, thin chewy New York style crust with just the right amount of sauce, then Gus's is the place! We live in Scottsdale, have a retail shop on 5th Ave. and will NEVER order pizza anywhere else! THANK YOU GUS!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for: relatively inexpensive pizza -- and it tastes like it.

We ordered a white pizza, garlic knots & cheesecake from Gus's the other night. We wanted to try Gus's because we refuse to ever order from the chains: Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa John's and the like and wanted to find a new local spot. 

About an hour later the delivery guy arrived, dropped off the pie, and right after he left, we realized they brought us the wrong pizza. 

I called Gus's and was put on hold for about 5 minutes, the guy who answered the phone then told me that when they ring up orders they put the white pizza in the system the same exact way they ring up a cheese pizza and are expected to just tell the cook beforehand \"this one is a white pizza\" - he said he forgot to do this and he was sorry.

This system probably has failed them more than once before, so I hope that these mix ups and my review will encourage them to improve the way they ring up orders. 

Anyway, hey, it's cool, we all make mistakes, life goes on. He told me he would talk to a manager to see if they could do anything and call me back in 5 minutes. I waited about 15 minutes and gave them a call back and asked to speak with the manager. The manager said they would deliver us the right pizza ... in about 45 minutes. 

When we finally got our pizza, we were disappointed because it was just not good. Other reviews on Yelp mentioned that they serve up a greasy pizza and I didn't mind, but my girlfriend made sure to thoroughly sopp up the grease with a paper towel before trying it. 

The garlic knots tasted like undercooked dough and weren't flavorful. They came with two little cups: corn syrup and canola oil disguised as tomato & garlic sauce. Yuck. The cheesecake was a thin slice in a package - it wasn't bad, but I am guessing that none of their desserts are homemade. 

As these events unfolded and we tasted the food, I didn't feel like I just ordered from a local pizza place. It was a legitimately mediocre experience and we are bummed and are now back to our quest to find good local pizza spots.  

To recap: the incorrect order, the lack of follow-through, the delay in rectifying the situation & mostly: the quality of the pizza and garlic knots are what makes this a 1-star pizza place.

To add insult to injury - after this experience, I came home to find that Gus's came in my neighborhood and jammed flyers in everyone's front door. Thank you for littering our complex with your junk mail..."}
{"text":"Terrible! The biker bouncer guy physically put his hands on me because I was eating a taco in line to buy a pizza. Such an asshole. I will never walk in his place again. Extremely downgrading to females!"}
{"text":"Ok. Went in after the W down the street. Ordered a slice and a beer. Nobody was in there and it was 10 o'clock. We went there specifically because they served beers. The guy working the counter refused to sell me beers because of HIS religion. And he was serious, i thought it was a joke..........why does some one that \"can't\" serve beers; work in a place that serves beers?Why is he working the register where the beers are served?
I get freedom of religion, this is what makes our country great, but i feel MY religion (atheist) was infringed upon. That dude needs to work at a pizza place in Raqqa, Syria where he can not serve beers all day to anyone because ISIS says you shouldn't."}
{"text":"They got Roaches! Me and two other friends seen two baby roaches crawling on the glass display case. If I could, I would give this place -10 stars for being dirty. If you want some decent pizza with the possibility of a roach on the side, Gus's pizza is the place for you. I hope they read this so they can clean up their act. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but will not wait 2 hours for a pizza to be delivered. KRISTA is the one that took the order and assured me that it would be 45 to an hour, okay. But 2 hours later on a \"non busy\" night is not good. And then to be yelled at when it finally does come is absolutely unacceptable. I was charged and told that I will not pay, she told me she would take the pizza back. Got the store managers name and number, made a call and will be getting a full refund. 
Glad I got to speak with someone in charge because I don't think he is aware of what a rude person she is."}
{"text":"[My original review from 6/2010]

a 24-hr pizza lounge are you kidding me? am i in heaven?? NO. well, this place is next to uhhh myst? whatever that place is with the flames. would love it if those flames catch this shithole on FIRE (used to be sultry dogs). never before seen this building busy or close to having more than a few customers at a time at any given time with any given name...not surprised it SUCKED.

easily the worst pizza place i have eaten in town. granted i was a bit tipsy and its near 2am.. but, i ordered what looked like a sausage/pepperoni slice and some garlic knots, at $2.99, cause the breadstix usually tells me how a place fairs on food. the bill was $8 even. turns out i got the meat lovers slice for $5.01(?). could barely tell. it took them at least 5 minutes to heat up the slice.

the knots came out a solid 15 minutes after i ordered. jeez okay. wonder how long their so-called 32\" giant pizza takes to cook. this is supposed to be a 24-hr after-hour club party refuge?? jokes.

anyway the knots did look impressive for only 3 bucks. 5 fat knots. to be honest they were cooked near perfect flaky on the outside, extra doughy on the inside. and the texture was amazing oh yeah!.. WAIT. eating them however was quite the opposite. completely and utterly tasteless. neither/nor with their garlic brush, garlic dip, or extra garlic salt. everything was so bland. the bread taste just terrible. even the marinara dipping was terrible and blannnd as well. i thought i had cancer or was having a stroke for a minute. i tried to concentrate on making it taste good, taste at all. not happening.

now back to the slice. not impressed at all. to be fair, it did have a minimal 'taste'. for 5 bucks i should be able to see and taste the other 3 toppings i didnt see in the first place though. weak as eff.

now the menu looks impressive with salad sandwiches calzones etc. the 'we serve beer & wine' graphic jumped out first thing. great advertising! \"ill have a...\" except the part where THEY DO NOT SERVE BEER OR WINE YET. ok. idiots. oh there was a girl that stopped in to order some cheese fries. i was like 'ohh good choice....' no deal. they dont have those either, or, they choose not to serve them at that time. the dude answered like it wasnt blatantly on the menu in front of us, and very unfriendly to begin with. again. idiots.

im giving this a 0.34 star just for being another ridiculous place for pizza when *pizza pie, joe's, and best of italy* are all within view, literally. literally! and those are all better even on their worst days. this only gets that much of a score since i didnt actually try all of their food. dont expect to either. dont bother!

update: are you kidding me their website doesnt even seem to exist....JERKS!

update: really, so bad i might start picketing outside there tomorrow  \"soft dough, but please go! more pizza? hell no!\"

jeff out!

{"text":"I like to try out new places when I come across a coupon.  After all, I have a lot more mouths to feed now and who doesn't like to save a few bucks here and there.  Apparently Gus's doesn't like it when you use a coupon.  From the attitude when I ordered, to the \"hidden\" 18% gratuity (that they told me about after I questioned my total and also tipped on the credit card (beware of the 50 cent fee to use a credit card), this place should focus only on their late night drunk crowd from the bars.  The only good thing about the whole experience was they \"accidently\"  packaged my order \"to-go\".  Yeah sure, I bet having two hungry toddlers in the store for 40 minutes while we waited for our order made them re-think offering a \"dine-in only\" coupon."}
{"text":"The pizza was over cooked, and the sauce had no taste. Go to Grimaldi's on Scottsdale Road it's delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered a Greek salad with chicken here,  it was Disgusting. The chicken was artificial, like a chicken nugget sliced up super thin. I ordered oil and vinegar on the side, so they gave white vinegar and corn oil as a sad excuse for a dressing. I tasted a bite of my daughter's pepperoni slice, and that was flat and greasy. They have the nerve to call it \"'NY\" pizza, which is a joke. Maybe good for drunk college students, but not me. NASTY. Waste of $."}
{"text":"This place is gross.  The tables are not clean and the staff is rude.  I watched them wipe thier nose and then touch my foood.  When I questioned this the manager said that the germs will \"cook off\".  I left with trying thier food."}

{"text":"My husband and I came here because we had a restaurant.com certificate.  They no longer honor the $10/$25 ones...only the higher value ones, yet they are still being sold. Between that and that the place was completely empty at noon should have been an indication, but we decided to try it anyway.  The cashier got or order wrong several times.  We finally got our pizza and wings after waiting a reasonable time. Our soda was suppose to be a 32 oz fountain drink came as 16 oz.  We asked for diet coke, she brought bought of us coke (after we told her diet coke each of the three times she asked.) Finally getting the diet coke, it tasted super bitter so we ended up getting cans instead. Two bucks for a can of soda, bring your own!

The pizza was under cooked even with a nice thin crust.  The kids will like it reheated though.  Our boneless wings that we ordered not only ended up with bones, but was overcooked to the point you counted get it off the bone.

Lastly, you have to pay 50 cents on top of the bill if you want to pay by credit card - which depending on the processor is illegal to do.

End result, save your money, keep your appetite.  Go to Joe's Pizza two doors down.  You'll be happy you did."}

{"text":"Don't waste your money or time! Excessively long delivery time after 8:00 p.m. And when quoted 40 minutes. Poor delivery service. Lied about being in area only to show up 30 minutes later. Delivery driver called multiple times by store on where he was and delivery status and he never answered phone. Too many other quality timely pizza options in Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: somewhere between rundown night club and abandoned storefront. Multiple holes in the wall with exposed drywall. There is no air conditioning. No star.

Cleanliness: the smell of a rat nest emanates from behind the counter. Every chair is sticky. No star.

Food: ordered a calzone and some wings. The dough was pretty good. Small calzone has half of a medium pizza in size. One star.

Service: the cashier/server/whatever seemed to hate his job. I wouldn't blame him since the manager/cook/whatever was rudely critiquing him while I was ordering. The server was surprised we ate in for lunch; probably because we were the only people there. No star.

Price: $10 for a salad. $5 for a slice of pizza. Calzone was $7. It's really not priced well for the value. No star.

Overall: do not recommend. This may be the last review I ever write, because I might die from this food."}

{"text":"If you find yourself in a certain part of Old Town, after a late night of drinking, Gus's is like a beacon in the night.  Let's be honest, what's more alluring that greasy food after a night of alcohol fueled debauchery.

We stumbled in last night, after some pre-Halloween celebrating.  There was a line, but it moved relatively quickly.  My friend ordered two slices, I opted for the cheese fries.  Ordering something other than pizza on a late night could result in a debacle, but thankfully one of the employees there was super helpful.  As I waited for my fries, he grabbed a handful of suckers and put them in my basket, so not only did I get awesome service, I now have enough dum dums to last till next year.  He was kind enough to bring my fries outside so I didn't have to wait inside. With all those heat lamps, drunken bodies, and my long velvet cape, I was seriously hot; and not just in a conceited way.  ;)

Gus's is also a great place to people watch.  If you sit outside, you get a front row seat to the drunken flow of people in between clubs & bars, and an occasional police incident.  

The music is loud, the patrons are drunk, and the food is greasy.  What more could you ask for on a Saturday night?"}
{"text":"I accidentally stumbled into this place while trying to get to another pizza place that is right down the street and it sure was a bad mistake. The theme here is kinda like night club meets dirty strip bar with shitty house music and terrible decor. The staff just left me standing at the counter for like five minutes before taking my order and when I got the Za's they where greasy as hell, the sauce had no flavor, and the dough was not good at all. Unless you are super drunk and need a places that is open at 5 am stay away!"}
{"text":"First night of delivery took an hour and a half. My credit card was taken down three times and still wasn't rang up when the pizza finally showed up; the delivery guy had to call and give them my card number again. The guy who took my order wasn't super polite.  

Second night took 2 hours and 17 minutes. It's literally down the street from my hotel so I don't understand what the problem is. They refunded my money at least, by the 4th time I had called. The food itself isn't actually bad but this was pretty ridiculous.

The next day I received a call at 10 am. The day person was polite and professional. She made sure the charge was refunded and apologized for the experience. (Although a little annoying it wasn't already taken care of) If you order from this place, do it during the day. Because of this call and the food quality I'm giving it a 2 star review, otherwise I'd say steer clear."}
{"text":"Pizza taste like nothin! Ghetto man in a red jump suit screaming to people who pass by. It seems he is some type of manger. Annoying !"}
{"text":"I will never do business with you.  I am so tired of cleaning up the Gus's pizza flyers that are left on my door at least once every week."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza! The place gets packed, this is good and bad! Long lines but exciting atmosphere, and if its busy means you're getting fresher Pizza, so if you are hitting up clubs in Scottsdale definitely a must try at least once!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a MINUS 5 stars if I could. We ordered an order of garlic knots and 20 peice Buffalo Wings. There was no garlic on the garlic knots and the wings looked and tasted as if they were boiled and had no sauce on them.

I called back and they informed me they don't give refunds, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? You basically sold improperly cooked food and I am supposed to be okay with that? HORRIBLE FOOD!"}
{"text":"I ordered online and 2 hours later I still didn't have my food. I called to see where my food was and the guy on the phone sounded like he could care less. He finally found my order but it hadn't even been started yet. He said they would start working on it and they would give me a free drink. It's not like it was a Friday or Saturday night, it was Sunday   I order from them every week and the last 2 times it took hours to get my food. I hate Dominos but it looks like my only option."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. I ordered at 4am. they quoted 45min. fine. I called back 3 times. 1 hour and 30 min later, still no pizza. hotel is 5miles away. you do the math. I threw all the menus at the hotel lobby in the trash so nobody else could make the same mistake we did. terrible"}
{"text":"I've heard of Gus's for a while now, and the opportune moment to try it out presented itself this past Sunday.  We'd just left the overcrowded and noisy (albeit lively) Majerle's, and needed some food that wouldn't require a twist and shout performance to acquire.  Gus's shone like a beacon, with its short line, greasy food under heat lamps and empty patio with TVs showing the game.  

I only had a bite or two of pizza, but it tasted like your standard New York style thin crust.  There were plenty of flavors available, including Buffalo Chicken which looked quite good.  I opted for a Caesar Salad, which was twice as expensive but twice as big, full of greens, parmesan, dressing and way too many croutons.  Gus's won't become famous for their salad, but it was better than I expected.  

Beware of the ($10?) credit card minimum charge.  Due to a loud evening and a thick accent, I didn't understand the warning until it was too late.  

Assuming I have cash next time, I would definitely stop by again for a slice if I'm in Old Town for a while, but more for ease, price and grease than for quality ;)"}
{"text":"I understand most people probably don't order a salad from here.. But this is ridiculous! We ordered the Chicken Cesar, and it had no chicken, no croutons, nothing.. Just entirely too much dressing. I don't understand how you can mess up something so simple.."}
{"text":"If you're out in Old Town and are looking for a drunk late night bite, this is the place. Literally a 30 second stumble out of Derby and you're here.

I came at 6pm there was maybe 3 other people in the place.. I order ONE thing.. 25 minutes go by and I politely ask if my food was almost done, they look me up and down and treat me like shit as if I'm impatient. 20 MORE minutes go by and I still have nothing but dirty looks. I get nothing and finally I'm pissed they are SOOOOOOOO DISRESPECTFUL AND RUDE when I ask again. I'm sick to my stomach over the way I was treated and still got no food"}
{"text":"This is the kind of pizza craving you fantasize about while living away...!

I bet a friend he couldn't get them to deliver after the bars had closed. I lost!

Haven't bothered to order the \"pizza throw blanket\" like I'd witnessed that one night at the Tempe location but the customer service and delivery service after a long Old Town crawl can't be beat!

Thank you, Gus's Pizza!"}
{"text":"No pizza is worth an hour and a half wait. The best pizza in NY you never had to wait as long as I did. This was my first time and last time I will order from them. I will stick with Joe's in Scottsdale over Gus's. While the pizza was one of the best I have eaten out here the staff are horrible and the manager and owner is very sketchy. I was offered half price for the wait and trouble but instead they charged me full price then  refunded me , then charged my card again full price, refunded me again and then charged me DOUBLE of  my bill. The managers and owners are clueless. It is a shame because like I said the pie was not all that bad."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff love mr sho bizz and Aaron ! The even helped me when my phone died two thumbs up with the cheese cake"}
{"text":"I got delivery from these guys. Just ordered a cheese pizza and their tomato and cheese bread. The 18 inch pizza seemed ginormous, the crust was OK, not super thick or too doughy. The cheese was good, perfectly cooked, not burnt.  
I really enjoyed their cheese/tomato bread (essentially like a garlic bread type appetizer) but did not like the dipping sauce. The delivered within about an hour (which is fine, my place can be hard to find) and I enjoyed the meal. 
Would I order from them again? Absolutely. Are they the best pizza in the world? No, but for 20 bucks for all that food, it suited me just fine. :)"}
{"text":"Greasiest pizza I've ever tried.  Couldn't even eat it because the grease soaked through the crust and it was falling apart.  I'm from NY and I would rather eat nasty chain store pizza over this stuff!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for my salon, had a family of lady's coming in to get there haircut and styled, we loved the pizza!!! Great flavor!!"}
{"text":"When the local Silver Mne sub shop closed (temporarily?), for late night, I thought we'd try Gus. Wanted sandwiches, not Pizza, and the experience was not good. My female friend wanted onion rings and a cheese steak. I wanted a turkey sandwich  Well after telling the night manager onion rings about 3 times, we got....wings. Hey! Onion Wings?!? That said, my turkey sandwich was not cool The end had no meat so it was all bread, and the entire sandwich had barely one layer of turkey. Yes it was quality meat, but there was simply not enough of it to cover the sandwich. I called to complain twice, and was offered $5 credit.  Delivery time was good, the cheese steak was report ably OK, but the wings...they were dry. Plus it was not inexpensive. Hope you have better luck."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery and it took 2 hours when they said 45 min. Called back to check about an hour & 15 min in & they had told me they made the wrong pizzas so they were remaking them and it would only be 15 minutes. Than about 45 minutes later we called again and they said the pizza was on its way. They acted as if they were going to take care of us by giving us a coke & a water and taking 10% off. When they arrived with the pizza it was a single can of coke, small water bottle, pizzas that seemed that they weren't cooked all the way and were semi warm. I would never chose to eat here again or order pizza from them."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and would highly recommend! The service was great as well. Very satisfied and would come again!"}
{"text":"This was terrible pizza. We ordered from Postmates tonight, and we've eaten here in the past so we figured we knew what to expect. No, it was awful. The pizza is VERY undercooked. The dough is basically raw just under the toppings. I also found a hair in the pizza, and I'm positive it wasn't mine as it was not only a different color and length, but it was baked into the cheese! We also ordered garlic knots and those came burned but also cold and stale. This is by far the most disappointing pizza I've had in years."}
{"text":"Better than others delivery and though a bit of a wait worth it. 
Ordered and paid extra for hot peppers. Others give it away. 
Be sure to confirm on phone. 
 Nice  menu and deserts."}
{"text":"Delivery well over an hour and 45 minutes. Called multiple times and couldn't get ahold of anyone. Horrible service and needs to be shut down!!!"}
{"text":"Whoever owns this place now is charging a 50 cents credit card fee just for using your debit card. Another way to rip off consumers. This is pretty unprecedented and the pizza is not worth that extra 50 cents anyway. Will be avoiding this place in the future. Also, they have a weird frozen drinks machine in the middle of the store clogging things up. Thieves."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of pizzas and a salad last night. They said it would be about an hour and twenty minutes for delivery. It took over two hours. If you think you will be hungry in the near future, this is not the place to get pizza. They also apparently have stopped answering their phone, so you can't even check to see if they're still coming after waiting for two hours. I wonder how the elderly order pizza if they don't have computer skills. I guess they don't get pizza. ? the pizza is really good, but you'd better really want it and be willing to wait."}
{"text":"I first wrote this review immediately following my experience at Gus's. I was disgusted and pretty pissed off at that point, so I decided to come back and write my review once I had calmed down and didn't want to scream at the employees for their complete lack of interest and care. First off, I have one compliment- the door guy was absolutely wonderful! He did his job well, and he was pleasant while he did it. Now on to the two disrespectful young men behind the counter... After ordering 2 slices of pizza from the extremely lacking display case (God forbid you ask what pizza is coming out next because they will consider you to be hostile), I asked for my pizza to be well done (you would have thought I was asking Santa for a new pony by the kid's reaction)... the gentleman, who actually wasn't on his phone the entire time, CHUCKLED at my request and then responded \"No\". I should have walked away there and went across the street or next door. THEN, I waited at the register while the incompetent cashier played on his PHONE for almost 3 minutes while I waited. HE WAS ON HIS PHONE! He did not look up once until the other guy prompted him to. Once the food came out, and I was pretty frustrated already, my slices were soggy and flavorless, so I made once last request at the counter to the man saying NO again to putting my slices into the oven to be cooked to well done (I'm sorry but I don't want to have to eat my pizza with a spoon). Although I realize this was not proper etiquette, I nonetheless called to the KIND man in the kitchen to please cook my pizza longer, and he happily obliged. I NEVER write bad reviews for restaurants because I believe there are unknown reasons that people have a bad night or a restaurant is maybe struggling in certain areas to find their way, BUT this is NOT that place. This is a restaurant that hires 2 careless employees who have no understanding of customer service or any sort of kindness towards patrons- and I have seen this during my experience, as well as read about it in several reviews of this location. Hopefully the owner/management can turn this place around so that the good employees have a place to work, but I would not be surprised if this is just turned into something more productive and delicious! Try it yourself if you choose, but good luck, my friends. You're in for a treat."}
{"text":"Considering the gentlemen, if you can call him that, on the phone called me a stupid mother f**cker and hung up on me telling me not to call back I'd have to say the service was not so great. This was in response to am over 2 hour wait time with not call from the restaurant. I called in and I have to assume they just forgot my pizza, it was a pepperoni pizza. Not the hardest pie in the world and I live maybe 2 miles away. He claimed it was New Years and that is why. Well then don't offer delivery. I'm sorry but when I see an ad up for pizza delivery, I would believe you would have taken the necessary steps to sufficiently staff your business. I mean, were you surprised it was busy? All in all, the pizza is normally okay minus the uncooked flour on the crusted and the consistently charred bottom. It's good for when you're drunk and have no choice or can simply just forget you ordered so their terrible service time goes unnoticed. Also, a couple off this ago a guy in a taxi can delivered my pizza. I'm not even sure he has his food handlers permit. I'd be surprised if this business meets standard requirements when it comes to proper food handling. Well I'll sit here and wait for a BS email from their manager talking about how that's not how we do business etc. hahaha"}
{"text":"This place took two hours to deliver cold ass pizza got my order wrong had attitude when I didn't want the pizza worst place to order there manager is horrible try to make me pay for something I didn't order"}
{"text":"Took an hour and half and we had to eat air because they never showed up if I could they would have no stars lunch break was over thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"Worst pizza and wings ever ordered wings were raw and pizza was all dough and sauce asked them to fix problem and come to find out they don't do refunds and would not fix the pizza or cook the wings correctly gave us credits lol if anyone wants them let us know"}
{"text":"Pretty slow, and the service is subpar. Only thing keeping this place alive is the food."}
{"text":"Sad customer service I paid for my Pizza and soda , they tool my credit card , I ask for my Pizza as people behind me was getting there food . I grab my soda and she wanted to charge me again. I put in front of the girl my receipt and she ignore it. Her reply look at that sign , I can refuse service to anyone. I told her you took my $ I want my pizza, that has been now sitting in the top area for a while . She ignore me and went to the next customer. 

Finally talk to another worker there and he got my cold pizza and ask if i got my soda? The girl rude as can be said oh you had a soda. Told the girl beside me at least your normal. 

#1 I was not drunk or on drugs, but I think the workers there need to get tested for being on drugs. They seem to be at a loss by holding peoples credit cards and not realizing they are holding after they charge card within a min the girl reasking for him to pay. Happen to customer next to me. Crazy she needs to be FIRED!"}
{"text":"I'm giving one star because I still like the Pizza. But in customer service they have no idea. Only because of that I am not calling this place again and instead I went to another pizza place by Scottsdale road which is an Italian family owned restaurant , it was amazing! ..Its called Lo cascio...
I called this place last night and after one hour waiting for my pizza I called and they said that they tried to call me (lie) and that it went directly to voicemail (lame) and they didn't leave a message?? Because they had the wrong address (lie again) ... So I said you know what you better not bring me that cold pizza, you need to make a new one, that girls was so rude and she said I will hook you up?? After another 30 min The driver called back, saying if I could please give them AGAIN my credit card number (to the driver???) because they had the wrong number.! I said are you still at the shop? He said yes... It was already two hours late! I said to the driver please let me talk to the girl, I asked her what's happening? She said don't worry I am sending you an extra 2 liter soda!! Haha please! I then decided I didn't want that pizza anymore! And she only responded ok bye. Do not waste your money here when you can get a better quality in pizza and customer service down the street... I am never calling back to this place... Ever!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain, but they have given me the worst pizza delivery I have ever experienced.  Pizza was delivered 25 minutes after what they estimated.  That I can deal with.  However, after opening the pizza box, it was wrong: it was missing ingredients and meat was on the whole pizza when we ordered it only on half because we have a vegetarian in the house.  We also ordered garlic knots that arrived much too undercooked to even eat, and marinara sauce was missing.  

I should have checked before the delivery driver left.  Anyway, I contacted them to request the correct pizza be delivered or for a refund.  I was told I wouldn't receive a refund unless the entire wrong pizza was returned first.  Too bad two pieces had already been eaten!  Thankfully, Eat24 stepped in and had the correct pizza delivered, but by that time we had lost our appetite and the terrible service left a bad taste in our mouths.  

Listen to the reviews on here to avoid going through what many here have.  Very disappointed in my experience."}
{"text":"pizza. yum. old town please expand your options.

can this line get shorter?

Tips from drunken hazy nights after another fun tirade in old town. lol. But really, let's be honest with ourselves, Gus's is not really that great, it fills a niche and that is an afterhours grub spot to fill the tummies of the drunks and help sober them up to get home. Alcohol and dancing does make you hungry, and Gus's does that. 

Choices are limited for afterhours grub in old town, there's the Philly Sandwich co., two pizza joints, and denny's up the street. limited offerings, and the closest best mexican drive thru in my opinion is 2 miles away - FAIL. So you'[re stuck with Gus's where the douches come out and have fights while in line, people constantly cut, and there's a lack of order and at times civility but that depends on the night or weekend. I've only had the pepperoni and cheese pies. good? yes when you're buzzed/drunk anything's good and yummy. When sober, not so much. A-OK well it's satisfying and I've always scored free pies due to mass confusion. lol. good times."}
{"text":"Wish I could post a zero!  One of the worst experiences I have ever had In the restaurant business in my life!   Can't wait to tell me friends about it."}
{"text":"Worst business - Worst pizza in the world . Cheap & Messy ! I am not sure how Arizona hasn't shut them down . You're in for a Heath risk if you eat here!"}
{"text":"Greasy pizza, TERRIBLE service. Expect to wait more than an hour for mediocre at best pizza."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, but ordered today for delivery. Took 2 1/2 to get order and it was not complete order. I called and worker did not care. Horrible experience. Ordered food at 4:25 and didn't arrive until 7. Will not do delivery ever again."}
{"text":"Took a chance. Ignored the reviews that said it was good if you had been drinking all night and wanted something to eat before you passed out. If you have an oven put a frozen pizza in there you will be happier than if you get one delivered from this place. I'm thinking eating it right out of the freezer would have been better.  Yes. It was that bad. Perhaps I should have had a 12 pack and then I would not have noticed. So my only advice is to stay away. Far far away.  Trust the reviews and find another place to eat."}
{"text":"I placed an order and after two hours I called back and they said the driver should be pulling up soon. Another 20 minutes later... bad pizza, cold food, bad customer service. DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"Do NOT use their online ordering tool. We placed an order on super bowl Sunday (which we expected a wait). After an hour and 15 minutes of no pizza, we called to check on status and were told there was no order in the system (even though we got a confirmation.) A bit of a disappointment!"}
{"text":"The only plus about this pizza place is that it is open until 6am. We waited over 30 minutes for a pizza we were told was already made... When we discovered they were not making it, we then had to wait in line again for cold disgusting pizza that they shoved into the box. It was inedible. The owner was extremely rude, disrespectful and couldn't care less that we were upset. I have never posted a yelp review but I am so furious in how we were treated and how terrible the service was. Good riddance, Gus's', good riddance."}
{"text":"Went to this place not really knowing what to expect but the wings were awesome!!! Gus was also so so nice and we will for sure be back soon :)"}
{"text":"two words: outstanding. we ordered for delivery and it got here soooo fast! it only took 2 hours! and they were very generous with the toppings! we ordered half pepperoni and half mushroom and they put pepperoni on the whole pizza! overall this was an amazing experience im soo glad i spent my money here! wow. such pizza. very delivery."}
{"text":"amazing tasting pizza joint in Old Town Scottsdale! Stop by and dig in! Frozen margarita's will be coming soon to this hot spot!"}
{"text":"Was highly disappointed with my experience here. Went for pizza to beat the crowds before the bar closed  and ended up waiting a collective total of 45 minutes for two slices of CHEESE pizza anyway! After I ordered, they didn't have any cheese slices left so I had to wait which is fine I get that. 
I go back to the counter 15 minutes later wondering what's going on when I see several guys one after another coming in and slipping this bigger guy (who was actually really nice) cash to just skip the line and get them pizzas. He even snagged a couple waters for them too from the fridge he was standing by. I noticed at least six people doing this while I was standing on the side waiting while everyone else was just waiting in line the FAIR WAY. 
These guys were walking out with ENTIRE pizzas after two minutes after I and many others had been waiting for about a half hour at this point just because they were sliding money to this guy as tips under the table. I will not come back to this establishment I don't care if the \"pizza is better than Joe's\" which I highly doubt- because once I finally got my pizza it was COMPLETELY BURNED. At that point I was just so annoyed, ate about half and went to Taco Bell. THANK YOU Taco Bell for saving me from an unfair corrupt establishment. If it wasn't evident already; don't go here especially on a Friday or Saturday night after the bars unless you have an in with the big dude at the wait area to get ahead of everyone else."}
{"text":"I had never been to the Scottsdale area before. I walked in to get some pizza. I walked up to the counter and was quickly told that I went the wrong way. I apologized and explained that if there had been a sign, I may have gone the other way. My friend and I both ordered a slice of cheese pizza and payed for it. After we paid, they said we were out of cheese and we had to pick something else. We didn't want anything else, yet they wouldn't refund us."}
{"text":"Bomb pizza. 23 bucks for a medium fed 4 people. Margaritas $6 with different flavor options."}
{"text":"if i could give this place -5 i would. worst customer service ever. they treat the customers like shit. their pizza sucks. the manager sucks. the security is rude. they care about their $300-400 dollar customers but if you a $40 customer they don't care about you."}
{"text":"Ordered a calzone and my mom had a sandwich we waited for almost an hour. We were the only customers in the restaurant. Two employees one was the cook/register guy the other guy I'm not sure what he does. The place smells of a Juarez night club."}
{"text":"This not only is some of the worst pizza I've ever had, but it's also horrible service!! I can't say I've ever disliked much pizza but the elementary cafeteria served better pizza than this!!! Also they charge extra for Parmesan cheese which is ridiculous. Their extra toppings are about 3X as much as other places. Workers were rude.   I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Ok. I have been waiting forever without being acknowledged. That is unacceptable. Three customers in front of me have already walked out. That is just bad business..."}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered some pizzas at 10pm, to be delivered to the house we were renting 1/2 a mile away.  It's 11:52pm now and after 4 calls to check on the order, still no sign of the pizzas.  First two calls, we were told the driver \"just left\" and should be here soon. Third call, we were told the guy who took the order messed up, never put it in, so pizzas were never made.  I called BS, said we were told twice already that they were \"on the way.\"  Guy on the phone was flustered, didn't know what to do or say other than offer to re-enter the order.  Fourth call was 25 minutes later, and supposedly pizzas were just put in the oven.  Ridiculous.  This guy shouldn't be in business...he clearly can't handle running a simple pizza stand."}
{"text":"This was an interesting place. My friends and I just got into town for annual golf trip and we're looking for a place to kill some time. We had already went and got our cigars so we decided to go get some drinks. Nice outdoor setting the light fixtures are pretty dope and the server was cool. My friend who only drinks beer when we're on this trip got to try the samples and they have a nice assortment of beers there. They have big TVs all over the place in the waitresses were real friendly we felt welcomed"}
{"text":"Be careful of this place.  The fettuccini alfredo is lousy at best.  It tastes like a powdered cheese type sauce and definitely not fresh.  The pizza is not fresh in the morning hours either.  I believe that it sits out all night.  I picked up a couple of slices for lunch one day and by the time I got it home to eat (10 minutes) the cheese had curdled.  Dont expect customer service from this place either.  The guy with the long dark hair (manager) could care less if you are satisfied once he gets your money. Believe me, you are better off going to Joe's Pizza which is only a couple of stores away."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE. ZERO STARS. I ordered pizza, cheese fries, and a salad, and my friends food was cold! They took over an hour to get here and we're not even that far, plus they charged us a 6$delivery fee! Also when i placed the order they said it would be 15min. When the guy finally got here and I gave him the money he said \"what, no tip??\" He was so rude and it was so awkward, I just walked away."}
{"text":"We ordered over 40 dollars worth of food. We were told it would be here within an hour and a half. After two hours, I decide to call because we haven't heard from them. They then tell me it'll be another 45 mins until they can get to us. It is late night- we are hungry and now suffering the consequences of ordering from Gus's Pizza . Never again."}
{"text":"Wow! this place has a great location! Right dab smack in the middle of all the excitement! Once all the bars close this please herds in groups of people like cattle! Ha Ha... I must say I have been included in that herd form time to time. The pizza here definitely hits the spots after a long night of dancing and drinking! Great preventative hangover medicine for sure!"}
{"text":"You know, I honestly wasn't expecting too much from Gus's NY Pizza Lounge when I stumbled in the other night at who knows what hour of the morning. As it turns out, my already low expectations were just barely met. 

Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?

So you've just emerged from the Old Town Scottsdale club scene having no doubt made various mistakes of any and every kind, and more than anything in the world, you require sustenance. Well, you're not only in good company, but Gus's is one of the few places thats both walkable and open, so you trot on in, hopefully with a recently found temporary companion in tow that won't have you questioning your choices in life come morning. As far as service? It's pretty straight forward. You walk in, you wait in line, and you're given some lamp-warmed pizza from someone who probably won't judge you to the extent that the normal human being should. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Yikes. I was in no state of mind to take a photo, but $4.00 got me a what was a pretty standard sized piece of pizza (meat lovers in this case). You can see pics from other users on here, but needless to say, that's not even close to being worth it. $4.00? That's a king's fortune at any drive-thru window even at this hour. If we were looking at top of the line authentic New York pie? Sure, but we're not. No Star Granted.

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Blech. I'm inclined to withhold both stars here on account that this was some warmed-up, greasy dissapointment if nothing else, but two things will keep a star in tact. First and foremost, it was better than what I'd experienced the night before at Slices in Tempe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/slices-pizza-tempe). Second? I was actually really impressed that they had a gyro pizza, which didn't entirely insult the cuisine. However, don't be mistaken. This was greasy, soft, and not all that great. Single Star Granted.

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

I've had better. Way better, and that's the definition of two stars. I probably won't be back. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"Great drunchie spot. I think Joe's is better tho.

I actually have a collection of pictures of people who have fallen asleep at Gus'. Maybe I'll upload them later, lol."}
{"text":"Pretty great pizza I have got to admit. Big slices CRISP  crust; what you would want from a New York pizza by the slice. The toppings are plentiful and full of flavor on the supreme. Dozens of COLD beverages. COMFORTABLE seating.  Prime location to stop for a bite if your in the area."}
{"text":"Delivered wrong pizza. Ordered basic pepperoni pizza and a cold chicken white sauce pizza was delivered. Contacted restuarant and they said delivery company fault. Postmates said resturant fault. I am out 28 dollars. Someone screwed up and no one taking responsibility."}
{"text":"Verdict: Sorry Scottsdale, it's not NY pizza. 

The flavor was okay but otherwise underwhelming for texture of the crust. The pepperoni was average and didn't have a lot of kick for flavor.

Gus is just outside of a bar or three so it's probably great drunk food. Come to think of it, there were several drunk people there when we went. The one guy offered me a bite of his slice. It was a nice gesture but I respectfully declined.

This joint is what I would describe as a bit of a hole in the wall. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Holes in the wall are some of my favorite places because they can bring something special. Unfortunately, this was the wrong kind of special for me. I might consider going here again if it were late and I were pretty drunk and hungry."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, VERY unprofessional, I did not even get to try their offerings due to such discourtesy to a potential client.
I placed an oder from this restaurant via the app and an hour later received a call from a woman who works there. I don't know her relationship to the business, but she demanded I pay an extra $5 for delivery via calling Eat24 (which I ordered through) and having them edit the tip amount I had paid. Her reasoning for this was that I had been charged an inaccurate delivery fee. 
Upon explaining to her that it had been an hour since I had placed this order and was confused why I was only now receiving a call about this as well as the fact that it is their responsibility to make sure they are charging accurate delivery fees, she began yelling at a gentleman in the background. She reiterated what she had said and I pushed back again. She informed me she didn't know wha was going on, and that I would need to speak to \"him.\"
A this point I would like to say that it was not the money I was concerned about it was the customer service I was receiving. 
The woman I had been speaking to put down the phone and then I could distinctly hear her arguing with a gentleman in the background. He did not want to take the phone call, she did not know how to handle the situation, and so on. I then heard him tell her to get out and go home. 
The gentleman then picked up the phone and we had a similar conversation to the one I had had with his female counterpart, only he continuously talked aver me and what rude. The call ended with him saying he didn't care, he would be getting paid either way and I told him to go ahead and not deliver my order, I would go and cancel with Eat24. 
It is rare that I write a review. I either have to be extremely impressed or, as in this case, extremely dissatisfied with my experience."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza online at around 1:45am.  Apparently there was an issue with the order not going through although I did get a confirmation screen from their website.  So when I didn't get a call I called them.
I understand that it's their weeds hour when the bars get out, so I'm not being overly harsh, but...
It is now 3:37.  I've been up just waiting for my pizza so as not to be a jerk, but I've called twice, each time being told they were \"just leaving\".
Keep in mind, I must just be stupid for ordering from them because another time I ordered they literally DID NOT SHOW UP, late or otherwise.  They just didn't come.  Another time the pizza came smashed.  Keep in mind I have ordered from them probably only a half-dozen times.
And as I'm writing this, the delivery guy called me and said he knocked and no one came to the door, and asked if I still wanted the pizza.  I was sitting on my patio, because I'm not going to sit by the door for two hours waiting for a pizza that has historically been proven to maybe never arrive.  Before calling me he left.  After I waited two hours for a pizza.
The delivery driver read me my total and asked for my money even though I paid on the phone with my card, AND online with my card.  And now I'm eating the pizza, which is cold and sloppily made, which I could excuse if it arrived anywhere near on time.  They also didn't bring the sides I ordered.
Why they did not comp my meal is beyond me.  I work in the service industry and I'm the most understanding person in the world but this was inexcusable.  Oh, and for all of this, I was very nice when the driver arrived, and still tipped.  Here's his apology: \"Sorry for the lateness.  It's always like this.\"   Next time I want to order from Gus' I'll just give someone 25 dollars to punch me in the face instead.  There is absolutely no way this experience could have realistically gotten any worse barring my just opening the box to find in place of my pizza a note that said \"Joke's on you, go screw yourself\".  I would have one to sleep two hours ago if not for this god-awful experience.  I am literally amazed."}
{"text":"This pizza lounge is open late at night but the pizza was whatever. It was served cold and they did not bother to heat it up. However, if you are eating here at 3am in the morning, you are probably too drunk to notice the difference."}
{"text":"Gus's in Old Town is an establishment that conducts business in a very immoral, disrespectful, and potentially illegal way. The owner is apparently only on site between 3 AM and 6 AM, so I will resort to Yelp, BBB, and word of mouth.

I've ordered pizza from them twice, and both times have been double-charged on my order that took over 1.5 hours to arrive.  This last time, after my double charge, there was also a fraudulent purchase.  My credit card company is reviewing this and will hopefully take the correct legal action. 

As the saying goes, shame on me.  Unfortunately I had hoped the first time was an honest mistake.  Needless to say I will never order from here again and urge all of my friends and neighbors to avoid them as well.

As far as the pizza is concerned, do yourself a favor and save $25 ($30 for a large pizza) by buying a decent oven pizza for when you come home from the bars."}
{"text":"Omg THE WORST FOOD AND SERVICE EVER !
2 hours late and they forgot the pizza THEN THE FOOD WAS HORRIBLE!!!! Forget it go far far away from this so called Resturant  
Look at theses bad food photos"}
{"text":"This is going to be short and sweet. We need to take this place for what it is. A pizza place surrounded by bars and people that need to eat and soak up the booze. If you understand that you won't expect some gourmet place that will just disappoint. With that said the pizza is acceptable.  

Check it out. And Lyft home afterward."}
{"text":"Never delivered our food but claimed they came to the door. Do not order from this place late night."}
{"text":"Eat at Joe's next door. Objectively, Joe's has some of the best NY style pie in the country. Seriously. I have spent extensive time in NYC and I would put Joe's up against the best of em. The quality of ingredients that goes into a Gus's pie's are simply inferior. The sauce relies heavily on cayenne peppers for 'flavor' and the cheese is a low quality product. Gus's customer service is notoriously lackluster and it sometimes seems as if the staff thinks they are doing YOU a favor by serving you.Its not that Gus's in the worst pizza or something...I mean its better than Pizza Hut...but Joe's is truly a huge asset when it comes to the Valley's culinary landscape. Just Eat at Joe's."}
{"text":"Food was horrible, the delivery woman was on some kind of speed or maybe Coke? She gave us the wrong drinks. No napkins we were drunk and needed food, but literally threw it out of our hotel room. Btw when we called to complain that they couldn't hear me ?"}
{"text":"Ordered a small pizza, 10pc bbq wings and a order of fries. All seemed good until we waited for hour and half for our order. When it didn't show up after that, we phoned the store and they told us that we were phoning the wrong store and that there was never a order for that. Pretty stupid considering we definitely put in a order and were very nice about the situation. Don't order from here."}
{"text":"The people at Gus's finally got smart and put a location in Scottsdale.

So delicious. The inside has a lot more seating than the original, and it loks a lot nicer as well. Be prepared for a line out the door come 1:45."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza, their driver couldn't deliver. They wouldn't refund me had to call my cc company. Never delivered my order...worst service ever"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place is in business. Or why the 5star resort I'm staying at recommends it for their late night dining option... This is probably the only time I haven't checked yelp before ordering and I will never make that mistake again. We ordered delivery n after an hour of waiting they told us they had to make another one because ours had been sitting there and was cold...another 30 min he said... Umm ?!"}
{"text":"went in there to try a calzone.  took almost an hour.  i guess the best way to sum up this place is they opened across the street from a locally owned pizza place.  obviously people that would do that arent the kind of people who really give a shit if you wait an hour for your order."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. We ordered pizza late at night and used a credit card on the phone.  They never showed up and whichever address they did show up to, signed for our pizza. The next day they refused to credit our money back or even apologize for giving away our pizza to someone else."}
{"text":"This a hole in the wall pizza place my friends and I stumbled upon late one evening when we were jonesinng for something to satiate our craving for something cheap and easy. It's a perfect place go to place to soak up some of the alcohol consumed earlier in the evening.  

The folks working there weren't the friendliest.  Food took a while to receive.  It was OK.  I ordered a slice of cheese and they basically reheated my pizza as it was already made and just hanging out in a pizza warmer. 

You want something cheap and easy- this is your spot. You get what you pay for. Not the best pizza but it hits the spot when you need it."}
{"text":"Love ending up here after a good long night of drinking.. usually end up meeting a few new friends here or talking to strangers and itd pretty cheap if you get a whole pizza... well its like 20 bucks but its a huge frickin pizza."}
{"text":"Rude and shady, we wanted to order a small Margherita pizza for $15 and they talked us into ordering a large, sure whatever 5 dollars more. 

Then they offer us the large that is already made, ok cool, but they tried to charge us $32 instead of $20 without any warning.

 After asking why several times and several excuses like \"it has different toppings\" & pointing out that the sign clearly says $19.99 for a Margherita which is all we wanted. 

They finally admit it's because it's \"ready made\" so they're going to charge per slice, no way, nice try with a bait and switch. By this time a line formed behind us and it looks like we are causing a scene. 

We left without pizza, awesome, thanks guys! Stay away from here unless you want to get swindled."}
{"text":"It's 3am. You and none of your stupid friends are sober enough to just drive to McDonald's to get a few Hot N' Spicy Chicken sandwiches. Everyone has exhausted other chain pizza places. Papa Johns won't help you, Dominoes won't help you, Nobody will help you. Your girlfriend is puking beer vomits out in the bathroom because it's now Sunday morning, and that is the type of couple you are. Hearing the viscous but chunky puke come up has almost made you give up the search for a late night meal that will deliver. Then Kevin opens his dirty mouth: \"Dude...Gus's....\" A silence falls over the room as your comrades look at you for the Ceasarian thumbs up or down. You have had about 17 beers, so you give it the thumbs up, but there is no applause, for everyone knows what horrors await. You call Gus's New York Pizza Lounge. Through the void, you can vaguely hear the order taker on the phone as drunk douche bags from Old Town try to kill each other off over the madness of douchebaggery and shitty pizza. You look back at Kevin, hoping someone will take the phone from you; hoping someone will put an end to this awful decision, but no. He gives you a nod. You cringe as you order a Pepperoni pizza, for if you try to order anything out of the ordinary, you know the order will come out wrong anyway. Over the phone, you swear that the total was 17.99, but this will all be forgotten in the eon's it will actually take for Hitler's pizza to arrive at your domicile. You have completed the order, and you dare not use your debit card as the possibility of the pizza never arriving looms over your head. Now you and your friends patiently wait for doom. An hour into the wait, and one of your friends decides he is now sober enough to just drive home. 15 minutes pass. Your girlfriend is passed out in the bed. Kevin is waiting with you like a trooper. God bless Kevin. Another 20 minutes. Just as you are about to think you are sober enough to just drive to McDonald's for those Hot N' Spicy Chicken Sandwiches, the phone rings. The delivery guy is outside. You go down to get the pizza which is somehow now 39 dollars. You're already upset about waiting this long for food, and the fight has been this long anyway, so you pay. The driver doesn't even say anything. He just shoves the shit pizza in your face, punches you in the dick, and gives you HIV. You return to Kevin, with a weak victory. Both of you open the box to find naught but a piece of dough baked into a trucker's turds. But you know what? You eat it through a grimace and Kevin dies of dysentery. Your girlfriend breaks up with you on account of the HIV, and the owner comes over and kicks you in the dick just one more time."}
{"text":"Nasty pizza could not even finish it. Would
Not eat there agin. Over priced and the dinning room sucks abs was hot.  Soda was
Flat."}
{"text":"Do not go here. All the guy cares about is your money. He is so rude. Threw money back in our faces because his staff couldn't make the food fast enough and he just wanted the line to keep moving and collecting money. His other employees apologized to us on his behalf while he continued being rude to other customers."}
{"text":"Scottsdale has lots of good pizza places, including Joe's next door, so it hardly seems another is needed, but since I've yet to find a place with good hot oven grinders, I thought I'd give Gus's a shot at it.  The toasted Italian grinder was at least in the ballpark.  The provalone was melted, the italian salami was good, and the bread was first rate.  My only real complaint was that the assembly was all orchestrated in the back room so I couldn't direct the amount of lettuce, pickle or onion, and there was no hot pepper.  Also the two employees showed absolutely no interest in winning over the customer."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is good. I definitely like it. But I ordered on a Thursday, not Friday or Saturday, and it took over 2hrs to get here. What the f*ck!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of extra greasy NY style pizza maybe? I'm also not a fan of having my pizza reheated. Unless of course I'm being a lush and desperately need something in my system. Besides more booze. Lucky enough for me this pizza joint is in the heart of old town Scottsdale. 

So the next time you're in old town... After a night of shaking your ass In one of the may dance clubs about the scene or having a pants off dance off on a bar and several drinks too many, Gus's NY pizza might be just the thing you need! Pizza by the slice is a nice option for any drunkard! Take your slurring and stumbling self down there and sober up!"}
{"text":"I probably should have checked reviews first. I ordered and it took 45 minutes to get my order. I ordered garlic cheese bread and a COLD italian sub. What I received was garlic bread with cheese that has just been thrown on top at the last minute (or so it seemed when it fell off every piece I tried to tear off) and a hot italian sub that was soggy. Can't say that I will be a returning customer to this place."}
{"text":"God awful and slow. Spent 30 dollars on 8 slices of pizza and it was cold!!! WTH! The two clerks were absolutely the rudest people ive ever spoken with. Jesus Christ. Im never going back here again."}
{"text":"Awful place.  The pizza is way too greasy and soggy, the ambiance is more like a cheap and dirty lounge then a restaurant.  Make sure you NEVER order delivery late-night.  I ordered a pizza at 2:00AM and was told the waiting time was 45 minutes.  Two hours later, after I called to cancel my order, the delivery guy showed up to my house with a pizza that had sat in his car for over 40 minutes.  The store had taken over an hour to make a small cheese pizza, and there was absolutely no accountability (the store blamed the delivery guy, the delivery guy blamed the store).  

To add insult to injury, after I called, was told my order was canceled and the charge was reversed, my card was still charged!

I never give a bad review after a one-time occurance, and always encourage redemptions.  Not the case with Gus'.  They are continually late and consistently offer horrible, soggy pizza.

If I could give zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"Finally! A pizza place that makes it like NY. Just ask for them to cook it a little longer than normal in the oven. The best pizza I've had in AZ so far."}
{"text":"When you order and see the option on the menu for a whopping 32 inch pizza, why not tell me you're just going to put two 16 inch pizzas in two boxes? A disclaimer would've been nice, and I paid more than the price of two 16 inch pizzas. So I guess apparently if you order take-out, even though it's an option, you don't get the 32 inch. Do not get your party guests excited about the 32 inch pizza you just ordered like I did. It's like a scam to get a a better credit card tip for the extra work in making a 32 inch pizza, and then not bring it. The delivery worker did not explain why either. Again, remove it as an option or provide a disclaimer. Furthermore, they forgot the dipping sauces I ordered. The cheesy bread has 4 small slices and the sauce that came with it was fridge cold. Also, not very cheesy. The only thing that made me slightly happy was the fact that it came a half hour earlier than the estimated delivery time, which was an hour and a half on Thursday night. When it comes to this place, it's better to just order from a major pizza chain rather than trying to be fun for once by ordering from a local pizza place."}
{"text":"What can I say....this pizza is probably my favorite in Arizona. I love cheesy greasy pizza. (no, seriously!) I tend to stop in during the day for lunch rather than in the middle of the night when its like a after hours spot (dont get me wrong, Ive done that too!). They do deliver FYI"}
{"text":"Just ordered off of Postmates and it is terrible.  All the toppings were tossed onto one side of the pizza and almost none on the other.  It was also extremely undercooked.  The pizza wasn't the worst part.  The cheese bread was basically warm dough with a container of garlic and basically no cheese.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"Well we walked In on a Sunday at 6 pm. It was empty during the 7 min we were there. Ordered three individual slices of pizza and they wanted it up nice and hot. The Mediterranean was really good! It did fall apart while eating but that didn't stop me from enjoying every last bite. I don't recall the other two names of the pizzas we had but they were meaty and delicious as well. I'd recommend it for a simple inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. I ordered from here a few weeks ago and my order took over 2 hrs, when eat 24 called them, I received a phone call from the driver wanting to charge me extra to deliver the pizza I had been waiting for. When he finally realized I was not going to pay extra he delivered the cold food anyway and didn't have the six pack of drinks I had ordered and offered no refund for the drinks I had paid for and didn't receive, nor the late delivery or the gross cold food I got. Terrible food and service!"}
{"text":"Terrible.. if you deal with 'show bizz'. He is disrespectful and should not be a representation of this company, I feel bad that he works there cause I enjoyed the pizza.. I will never be returning."}
{"text":"Never eat here. 
I worked there for 2 shifts. The mold and the dirt piles up everywhere. The sink that they use to wash dishes is disgusting. They don't even really wash them. There are bugs and trash everywhere. I have no idea how they are still in business. 
Can someone please call the health department?!"}
{"text":"Every time I've walked by Gus' after a late night out in Old Town it's been packed, but I can't speak about that experience--in December, I went for a quick lunch around noon and there was only one person working and seven slices of pizza remaining for the next 45 minutes. My group of 5 was fine, but the group behind us left after they heard that bizarre update. The pizza itself was nothing special."}
{"text":"Personally they don't even deserve one star. They suck. We ordered a pizza with ranch and parmesan cheese. Didn't get the cheese or ranch. The driver was nice, but then we called to complain that the pizza was cold and we didn't get ranch or parmesan and then apparently the 'owner' got on the line and proceeded to tell me I was wrong and that he needed the pizza back to determine why it was cold. This place is obviously incompetent. Not happy at all. Will never order there again. They have no people skills at all. Highly unrecommended."}
{"text":"After hours pizza to the rescue! Located near all the bars and clubs in DT Scottsdale. Good pizza at a cheap price whenever I what.... I'm in!"}
{"text":"The pizza here does taste good. They usually have a nice selection to choose from. The pizza is sitting in warming lights though. They do heat up the pizza for a minute or so, after you order it. Something to keep in mind when paying with a card, sometimes there is a minimum charge or there is extra money charged, to make up the difference of the credit card fee."}
{"text":"I honestly think that they should expand their business and shorten the wait lines by opening more registers. If the line is going out the door and hardly moving for 30 minutes +, yes the food is good, but you should take action to accommodate the influx of guests."}
{"text":"PAID CASH but STILL charged CREDIT.  WILL NOT REFUND.  Ordered by phone, gave credit card info. Pizza was delivered to hotel room, but driver insisted card was not billed and he needed cash.  Total was $52.17, gave $60 cash. The next day, $52.17 was still billed to credit card.  

After repeated attempts to get a refund, calling the business daily, no refund was issued.  In 30 days of promises, I never got a single call back.  I finally had direct contact with the owner after 30 days. He informed me delivery driver had quit and kept the cash, but that as a business owner, he had to make his money somehow.  I pointed out that in order for him to make his $52.17, I was then paying $112.17 for my pizza. He said he can't control what the driver did, though as the business owner who hired the driver, he is responsible for the drivers theft.  No matter what, the customer should not pay twice.  

The owner had NO signed receipt but still refused to refund the money to the card.  He agreed I paid cash, agreed that he had not returned my phone calls, even agreed that I was told I would not be charged on my card.  This business owner simply seeks profits and will not accept any responsibility for his poor hiring choices.  

I do not suggest giving them your credit card information - though I am sure the owner would really prefer sticking to cash sales anyway given his interest in profits."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food quality service back by solid work ethics makes this place good. Late night delivery and or pick it up, th ey are fast and good food. Love this place"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars... I ordered food online, sat 4 feet from my front door with my phone sitting next to me on the couch and waited.... and waited... and waited... 20 minutes after my \"estimated delivery time\" I finally tried to online chat with eat24 about my very delayed order... no response... weird. 
An hour after my food was supposed to arrive I FINALLY called the restaurant to inquire about my order... apparently while sitting 4 feet from my door with my phone next to me on the couch I missed every valiant effort made by the delivery driver to gain my attention inside my impenetrable fort of solitude to bring my dinner. 
I confirmed my address and phone number with \"incredibly helpful\" \"customer service attendant\" (separate quotations absolutely intentional) and then we both sat awkwardly silent and pondered what this whole scenario meant to both of us before I finally gave up, hung up and ate jelly beans for dinner.
Short story long... I wish I could give 0 stars."}
{"text":"First time ordering.  Delivery came faster than quoted.  Delivery driver was incredibly polite, and the food was amazing.  I can't remember the last time I had a hot sub that good!  It was awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to grab a quick slice after making the old town bar rounds. I don't think I'd ever go out of my way to eat here, but it sure hits the spot when you've got a good buzz - location, location, location."}
{"text":"It's weird this place is a pizza lounge, but it works!  It's open 24/7 and is across Myst so after the club it's the spot to be at.  They serve New York style pizza along with other goodies.  Another weird thing that works in this place is they serve wine.  Something that doesn't work for this place is their lazy service.  My party and I were sitting outside and the man working there goes outside to tell us the food is ready when he should have brought it outside to us.  That is poor service!  I'd understand if we were inside & we were able to see when our food was ready, but we were outside.  So I'm being generous here in giving them four stars."}
{"text":"They put weird pizza cheese on my garden salad and only filled up my ranch containers half way for a huge salad. I didn't like the salad because of the weird pizza cheese. Never ordering from here again"}
{"text":"Went there late on a weekend. Crappy service, very expensive ($8.50 for 2 poorly made slices of pizza). Pizza looked like it had been sitting too long and the toppings were soggy. Entrance area looked unkept and dirty. Just because you're partying at the clubs nearby, do yourself a favor and avoid these guys at all cost."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza gus' s ny pizza next time in Az stop the too much sauce they too lit!!!!!"}
{"text":"This could very well be the worst pizza I ever had...ever!  Bland, dry crust, bland sauce, and the cheese was not the best either.  All in all it was an epic pizza fail.  So much for the comparison between pizza & sex..."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a late night snack after hitting up the clubs :) anddd of course people watch. Haha. 

We got the Vegan pizza. No cheese, marinara sauce, jalapeño and mushrooms. It delicious!"}
{"text":"We bought a pizza late and it was cold. Weird.  Probably would have been good if it was hot and fresh but cold?  Strange.  Never get cold pizza unless it's leftover."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and should have known from the previous reviews that I'd be disappointed. Took over an hour for our food to arrive, pizza was cold and missing toppings, they forgot our soda and ranch, garlic knots were not flavorful and hard, and the stuff was not helpful at all."}
{"text":"DON'T go here for lunch! The Gus's is designed for the after club crowd. NOT the local businesses' lunch crowd. 
 The building doesn't have air conditioning, possibly only swamp coolers. It's too hot & humid. 
 The don't have fountain drinks or iced tea, only canned sodas & $1.50 small bottled water. 
 Service is extremely slow. Only two customers in the building and wrap took a lot longer than it should have. Employees are not knowledgeable about the menu, ordering. 
 Pizza is just ok/not bad (Joe's down the street is better.)
 No reason to go back."}
{"text":"I called last night and set and order for delivery, thank god I didn't pay with my card because it never showed up! I never got a call or anything! So unprofessional I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick slice of yummy pizza! I also like the 2 slices + a beer for under $6. Great atmosphere, warm up the pizza and spots to sit down as well inside or out. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place actually sucks.... messed up our order twice and got hit on by every person in the building"}
{"text":"I've walked past this place a few times coming and going to events. It's really perfect for sitting and chatting after you've been drinking. It's surprisingly good, I don't generally like pizza crust but I ate all of this one.  It kinda tastes a bit like sourdough.  I probably wouldn't go here if I haven't been drinking buuutttt I was last night and it was perfect."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to get some pizza while bar hopping today and it was literally the biggest mistake of this weekend. This older woman who worked the cash register was so rude, literally becoming combative with multiple customers, holding orders hostage in an attempt to correct people's demeanor, and called the cops on people for acting a little rowdy. I was just trying to get pizza and the lady took my credit card, gave it back to me, and accused me of trying to get free pizza after I asked for the pizza afterwards. I then checked my bank account to see if I was charged, saw that it wasn't, told her that she never charged my card and asked why she even gave my card back to me, and then she got super rude with me and told me \"I don't give free pizza here, I'm not stupid, I know I didn't charge your card.\" I can't believe this place is still even open. She literally looked like an ex drug user and seemed to be taking her unfortunate life out on people just trying to get pizza for $3.25 a slice. Go to Joe's instead of this place. The people that work there actually have all their teeth and were very pleased to take money in exchange for pizza without any drama. The cops who came to investigate at Gus's told me the same thing, \"I wouldn't even come here, I would just go to Joe's.\""}
{"text":"Worst service of my life!!' The woman that takes your order is a b*** she' feels entitled to look down on you!   BEWARE CHEAP INGREDIENTS BAD FOOD STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Gotta love Gus's! They have great pizza with perfect crispy crunchy crust, great options for beverages including beer n awesome people working there!"}
{"text":"Called in an order..... And hour later we call back asking where it is since we were told 30 minutes and were told sorry that they were very  busy and would make another pizza for us and that it would be another 30 minutes like he totally forgot we ordered. 
Worst service ever!!! Just didn't even care we had already waited an hour and were about to wait another 30 minutes !!! Just kept saying how busy they were..... Like sorry we didn't make your pizza we were busy with other customers .... as you're not important !!!!! 
DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! This place sucks!!"}
{"text":"Speaking for the local delivery drivers. Your system is horrible. We constantly deliver the wrong stuff because your communication during rush is confusing. You have to physically remove drunk people from the wrong line because you have nothing marked clearly.

Delivery service drivers are people working to make money. They shouldn't be subjected to the mass amounts of inebriated patrons and a slow, loud, and confusing system. Get us in and out with the correct order and all extras the customers requested to benefit us all.

Solution: Put up a simple rope system to extend the line out the door. You are in jeopardy of breaking fire code as it is now. Use that central area to expedite."}
