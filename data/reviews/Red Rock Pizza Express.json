{"text":"I had a friend recommend this place to me but I am not ordering from Red Rock Pizza again. After waiting an hour and a half for my food ordered online through their website (with an emailed receipt confirming delivery ASAP), apparently they never got the order I found out when I called the number on the receipt. Instead of trying to rectify the order and say rushing it out, it was somehow my fault that the order never got to them. I found it very poor customer service to blame me for their own issue and accuse me of ordering from somewhere else (when I called their number off the receipt). We are going back to a chain where we actually are appreciated."}
{"text":"Nice local pizza place, ingredients are organic and are quite fresh. We've only ordered for pickup but the order is hot and fresh when we arrive and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Quick service! Ordered online, pizza was ready when I got there. Best donair pizza I've had, delicious crust! Will be returning :)"}
