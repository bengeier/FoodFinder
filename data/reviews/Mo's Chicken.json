{"text":"Great food and great price! The food comes fresh off the grill both the chicken and steak are awesome. Don't expect a 5 star restaurant look when you come here it's the food that matters..."}
{"text":"Meat was too salty. Order did not include limes. Didn't care for the rice or beans. May give them another chance but honestly if I cannot eat the meat because of how salty it is again then there is no point in ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Chicken is awesome. That is where the awesome stops. Went in to order their 2 chicken meal deal which was supposed to come with rice, beans, tortillas, and salsa. Order taker argued that they do not have that deal any longer. Told him it is still advertised he said he doesn't care and the manager is not in. Ended up getting two chickens, corn tortillas, and one 4 oz side of beans. They threw in a 2 liter bottle of soda.  Went to get the salsa and the guy says one salsa per chicken. The salsa comes in the small one ounce containers. 

We try to eat at and tell our friends about local establishments, but we don't appreciate getting the old bait and switch. 

Unfortunately for Mo's we were there for two reasons. One to get our Sunday dinner and the other to possibly add it to our list of restaurants we use regularly for corporate staff lunches. This will not be happening because of the poor customer service and false advertising."}
{"text":"I love this type of chicken and I was so excited to try this place. The people are nice. Some of the chicken was delicious but most of it was just okay. I personally did not care for the beans, rice or sauce. However,  maybe it was an off day. I might try it again.
Oh and the prices pretty decent."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is awesome! Just randomly got hungry at work and decided to try something new. Got chicken, chips, salsa, beans and rice and it all tastes amazing. My keyboard is greasy right now because I haven't stopped eating. Service was pretty quick and the delivery guy was ridiculously friendly. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"We placed an order for delivery and apparently they closed early. Won't be using them again."}
{"text":"I go here often as I am sick and tired of the fast food options for people who work in this area. 9 times out of 10 the chicken is on point. You have to be careful as it can taste as the cook didn't clean the grill in between batches of chicken. I usually go for the golden brown ones. 

The guy who is usually there is always nice and welcoming. The salsa has always tasted good and they keep it refrigerated. The only thing that keeps me from giving them a 5 star is the rice and beans. I dont care for them at all."}
{"text":"I'm glad you're on uber eats! Healthy option and good tasting chicken and carne asada!"}
{"text":"I am empresses d! I picked up a family meal. Brought it home and placed it in dishes and set the table. My family thought I had cooked and found a new favorite recipe. I almost wanted to take the credit.  When I explained they wanted to know when we were going to eat there again. Sine they have opened we have been enjoying all their dishes. They are not over priced. And very consistent with their delicious recipe's."}
