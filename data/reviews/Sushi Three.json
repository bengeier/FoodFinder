{"text":"Freshly prepaired, made to order sushi. More variety than you can shake a stick at!"}
{"text":"Oy. Cold, dull rice packed much too hard. Industrial wasabi paste. Fish was fresh, but inexpensive cuts. About the same as Giant Eagle."}
{"text":"I go there as a tradition with my best friend when she comes home and it's one of my favorite places. The resteraunt is quiet and low lit so it's very relaxing. Service is quick and friendly. The lunch specials are amazing deals and there's enough variety there that I never get bored with the choices. Their tempura is the best i've ever had, and the rest of their food is just as amazing. Their ginger dressing makes me want to drink it straight. Even thinking about it has set me drooling!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! Watched it be prepared in front of us and the entire place is super clean. Friendly staff. Highly recommend stopping here!"}
{"text":"WAY overpriced and the rolls are incredibly small. I was not impressed with the sushi either. If you are looking for sushi, Katana, only about a mile away, is WAY better. I would not recommend this place. If you are in the neighborhood, Bados right next door or IO cafe across the street are a much better choice."}
{"text":"Very large sushi menu. The prices are a little higher than average. Everything  tasted pretty good. At first glance, I remarked that there was plenty of fish inside my sushi. Then we realized that it was an optical illusion...there was hardly any rice in the sushi. Still, the fish was fresh and tasty.  We got 5 rolls altogether, a tuna tataki app and crab rangoons. All in all, it was 45 bucks. This wouldn't have such an issue but the portions just seemed on the smaller side. The tuna tataki was awesome, though!  I've had better, I've had worse...this place was alright. I probably won't go there again, not because of anything bad, but just because  there are better places to go."}
{"text":"I just got lunch from here today.  For $9.63, I got soup, salad, vegetables tempura, 6 avocado rolls, steamed rice, and pickles.  It was a ton of food and more than filling enough - I didn't even eat the salad and I was stuffed.  I will agree that the wasabi was pretty weak - I added tons of it and it added almost no spice or flavor.  Even though it was a bit pricier than I was expecting (my menu was outdated and said the lunch would be $6.95.  Oops.), it was also very filling and worth it for a once-in-a-while treat."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch take out while passing through the area. I think this is actually the first time I've had (restaurant) sushi in Pittsburgh... a bad first choice.  I barely ate half my food - lunch special, fairly priced for the variety at $8.50, and an order of hamachi (2 pc). -the hamachi, bad quality fish. stringy texture and chewy instead of melty... i'm starting to think I had better at the buffets in town, and not well assembled/pressed -sushi rice both in my lunch roll and my nigiri had that awful moldy smell from sitting in an enclosed and moist container for too long. Regular rice with my lunch was fine, so maybe it was the rice vinegar sitting with the rice that produced the awful smell :/ -brown avocado in my half-roll with the lunch special. Like, not just oxidized on the surface, but completely brown throughout -miso soup was SWEET -yakitori - 2 skewers of chicken breast cubes. DRY. and the surface of the cubes was all chewy and old.  -salad with ginger dressing tasted very refreshing, but the consistency of the dressing was practically water.   Basically... all misses. I'd give them the benefit of the doubt on the first try, but the old sushi rice and avocado, served to customers... just plain bad quality fish. UGH.  I was greeted by friendly and informative staff. Unfortunately, after that they shouted loudly either on the phone or in the kitchen, in Chinese the entire time, or taking personal phone calls and talked loudly across the restaurant in front of me as if I weren't there.  For the past 10 years, I'd driven past sushi 3 countless times. Gonna keep doing that from now on. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Sushi 3 since high school and it's always been a local go-to for good sushi. The quality of the food and service have always been consistent every time I have stopped in.   I've tried a number of their rolls and none have disappointed. The pricing seems to be pretty average as far as sushi goes. The space is pretty small with maybe five booths and a few seats at the sushi bar. But it seems that this place gets a lot of takeout orders because every time I'm in, there are plenty of people coming and going. Personally, I like dining in because it's so quiet and peaceful. In addition to fresh and flavorful sushi, the service is always fast. They usually have our food out to us in no time at all.  Unfortunately I don't live nearby anymore so I don't get to stop in quite as often. But when I'm in the mood for sushi in the South Hills area, Sushi 3 is my top choice."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Sushi Three. They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.  Speaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace. This is a big deal for me because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I dislike eating in the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh to date (although with more and more places opening this opinion may change soon!). If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy my food.  By the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something. There's some really delicious beef, chicken and pork dishes (one family member of mine absolutely adores their pork katsudon). But of course, a place with the word \"sushi\" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy. My personal routine order as of today is a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls. Sure, I'll occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me, but the truth is that Sushi Three makes such enormous orders that I need to be reeeally hungry to eat all of any other order I make.   But hey, at least you get your money's worth! I say definitely give this place a shot if you're a sushi fan."}
{"text":"Good sushi and nice staff. If you eat at the restaurant it's always completely dead inside--which can be nice if you want some privacy, or bad if you don't want the staff to hear your conversation."}
{"text":"This place has restored my faith in delivery sushi. For the longest time I could only eat it fresh (not delivery), but this is the second place ever I've found that I thoroughly enjoyed the sashimi appetizer, takosu, flower roll, and a spicy tuna roll with no asparagus. Of the two places ever, this is my new number one. The spicy tuna roll and and sashimi app were my favorites! The hubby got yellowtail fish jowl, and fried rice... Also very good. Delivery was on point and even the call to put in the order was smooth and easy."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my wife. The quality of the sushi was quite good. My wife had some tempura that was fabulous. Service was friendly and quick. We really enjoyed our lunch. We will be back."}
{"text":"I had lunch here this past week and got the sushi lunch special. I was surprised to see that there were only two other tables. The restaurant was dark and provided little in the way of ambiance. For $10, the sushi lunch special included salad, miso soup, 5 pieces of sushi along with a salmon roll and green tea. As far as how much you got for the money, it was a good deal.  On the negative side, the sushi was quite average, both in terms of taste and freshness.  Little Tokyo, which is located on Washington Rd. in Mt Lebanon (about 5 minutes away) has higher quality sushi, although it's a little bit pricier. If you are looking for good sushi, it's worth the extra five minute drive."}
{"text":"Sushi Three is my favorite sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh. Their food is always excellent. I've only eaten in the restaurant a couple times, I usually order take out. The vegetable spring rolls are delicious. They are crispy, not greasy & the dipping sauce they come with is so good! It tastes like a wasabi mustard combination. Cold sesame noodles are good. My favorite makisushi is the spicy salmon tempura roll, they fry the outer shell of the sushi so it's crispy & it's lightly topped with sauce. The Shadyside Roll which is smoked salmon, cream cheese & avocado, any of the vegetable tempura rolls which is a choice of yam, broccoli, asparagus or zucchini & the fresh salmon roll are all great choices.  You can't go wrong with Sushi Three. If you're a fan of sushi they are a must try!"}
{"text":"Sushi selection limited...  Miso soup tasted a little fishy."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood place. Food is good, service is great.  Try the tofu salad appetizer."}
{"text":"They delivered to us recently, and I wasn't ecstatic over the Shrimp Fantasy I had. The sushi was decent. Most of everything else was bland and average. I don't know if eating at the restaurant would have made a difference or not. The delivery did come on time, though. Nothing special in my book."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often, probably on average about once every 2 weeks, with colleagues from work, as our office is right around the corner.  Their sushi (I've had probably about a dozen or so varieties of their rolls) is always fresh and delicious and their miso soup is my favorite around.  The lady who works there is always so friendly and sweet.  I love this place, and would recommend it to anyone who loves Sushi in the Mt. Lebanon/Dormont area."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area, so I was looking for a good sushi place. This is a nice little joint.  It's very intimate, but they would have no problem seating a large party.  When my BF and i arrived we were the only ppl there (it was memorial day, so sushi isn't too high up ppls lists for dinner)   We ordered the spicy Edamame and 4 rolls.  Everything was reasonably priced, and very good.   Staff was friendly!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"sushi was dry and unenjoyable. the place itself is clean and the decor was minimal.  I was not a fan and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my second visit and alas, my last.   Our first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren't blown away nor were we impressed. But I will always opt to support a local Mom & Pop shop if all things are equal. This last visit was the pits.  It was 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish, very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls, the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff's attention her response was \"Oh, yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday.\" WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. Needless to say, we skipped dessert.   Our first visit deserved a 2.5 but this visit was a 1."}
{"text":"The other night, Kay and I did something...risky.   She didn't feel like cooking, so we decided to order in.  Fortunately there's the internet and the Pennysaver. In the Pennysaver, a local paper version of craigslist for those who don't know, we found a pamphlet menu for Sushi Three, yet another place I'd been meaning to try for many years.  \"Kay, why don't we just order pizza? They probably don't even deliver here.\"  \"But I. Want. Asian!!!\" Besides, did you call them?\"  \"No.\"  \"Well...\"  So I called, and by God they did deliver to Beechview after all.   \"But Kay, it's Japanese food. It may not hold up well.\"  \"But what about that takeout from Pan Asia you had your parents get you for your birthday? You raved about that on Yelp.\"  My Baby Doll coulda been a lawyer.   Alas...  The shumai was rubbery and had flavor that was blubbery. Why?  The 4 pieces of sushi were a tad mushy and left me anything but gushy.  The chicken bulgogi was gravely soggy, and its lack of true essence of BBQ made me go \"Eeew.\"   The Miso, in terms of taste, was a flat zero.   However, the salad with 1,000 Island dressing was a small blessing.   Kay had something called Shrimp Fantasy, and one bite confirmed for me that naming it such was heresy.    And I think that's all we had.   My Etrigan-styled antics aside, I'm not sure if our dinner would have been better had we chosen to dine-in at Sushi Three instead of having it delivered. Because of that, I might be willing to try them again. Emphasis on \"might.\" We did finish everything we ordered, but none of what we had carried with it any sense of culinary flair. In that sense, this meal came off as generic Asian food. For example, the aforementioned bulgogi just seemed like it could have been any Americanized Asian chicken dish, one that came from a Reader's Digest recipe or the back of a box of rice.   Sushi Three? Not for me."}
