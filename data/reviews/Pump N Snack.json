{"text":"Asked if a restroom was available at 04:23 am after my shift was told by clerk to walk to a casino though I was waiting for the bus I asked the man what if im a customer he said I told you buddy we have no restroom I asked how do you use the restroom then you hold it he said nothing don't conduct business here."}
{"text":"I wish I had a better experience at this Pump N Snack like I have always had when I visit Las Vegas. Usually there is a young man there who is very helpful and friendly. However I made the mistake of going late at night when there is this very old, rude, and crooked man working there. I have never had someone steal my money the way he intentionally did. He told me my total was $5.07. I gave him a $20 then I told him I had 7 cents in change. He took the opportunity when I was going through my change purse to pocket my $15. I insisted to have the police called to look to make sure I did not have the $15 in change. I waited 30 minutes for them to come. He still pretended like he didn't have my money. All the while his son, (who I believe is in on the scam) was watching and yelling obscenities at me. The old man went out to smoke as I waited inside to have the police come to solve things. I then asked him if there were coming, he then pushed me and called me a stupid bitch. Now, that I am over the initial shock of not receiving my money, and being physically and verbally assaulted, I will be pressing charges against this company. Please for your physical and financial safety, do not shop or get gas at Pump N Snack."}
{"text":"It's a dirty location with a foul smell of piss inside. From my short visit it's apparent their main clientele are transient."}
{"text":"Great gas prices and I like the mart! They have a great selection of snacks and their prices are fantastic! Super clean and the owner is very nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"This place is where I go whenever I am filling up the tank. It's got some of the cheapest prices in the valley. It has the unfortunate location right next to the 7-11 so you don't really see this place because the sign is small and the place is pretty dimly lit.  They also run a really great special of $5.99 for a 6-pack of coronas.  There's not really a huge selection of snacks & drinks but what they do have is really cheap.   But as bad as it sounds, some times I just don't want to stop there because there is ALWAYS at least on homeless person hanging around the parking lot, and dealing with it EVERY time gets old."}
{"text":"Worse than the 7 eleven next to it. They charge you a 40 cent fee for each debit card purchace. This place is getting over on people and should be reported.. With your help we can shut this place down."}
{"text":"My dad, my aunt and I stopped by here to get gas on our way back from seeing Joan Jett perform on Fremont Street. From the looks of it, I told my dad not to pump gas here because it looked very sketchy with suspicious characters and very poor lighting. He and my aunt agreed with me and we found another gas station in a better area. Not a good place to be hanging around at night anyway, especially if you're alone."}
{"text":"There are lots of homeless people and drug addicts around this place begging for money. Most of them are harmless, but some of them can be downright aggressive and rude. Watch your belongings. This place isn't that far off the strip, but it certainly isn't a place I'd recommend. Sometimes saving a few pennies on gas isn't worth it."}
