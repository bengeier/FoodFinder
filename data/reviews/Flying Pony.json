{"text":"Great coffee, delicious pastries, an artistic atmosphere and friendly service... Love this spot."}
{"text":"The espressos are rich and bold. Delicious pastries, my favourite is the feta cheese and spinach pockets - had to go back to get a second one after taking a bite out of the first. Very chilled and laid back environment. Ditto what others have said about the service, could use some more warmth, maybe borrow some of that charm from Brickyard Grounds. But then again, not everyone's passionate about serving coffees, certainly won't hold me back from returning. Overall, great little caffeine spot in the East end, goes on my list of places to go with Ness Y."}
{"text":"Good coffee, excellent atmosphere, friendly staff, delicious snacks."}
{"text":"In an area that is being spoiled with above average cafés, it is hard as a resident to choose a favourite. Loyalties are attached to routines. And for whatever reason, my narrative has made The Flying Pony my regular stop for a morning jolt or weekend snacks. The café which doubles as an art gallery (or vice versa, depending on your perspective) is home to a cosy communal space with couches and a long island-table with benches. The walls are covered with different art pieces every week, displaying what local artists have to offer. Some of these items are for sale although I have never inquired about a purchase. The staff is very friendly and greet everyone with a smile and a story. The baked goods here are delicious and very fresh in the mornings. The almond croissant is my personal favourite. I have not explored the drinks menu beyond the Americano and the latte. They both get the thumbs up from me. However, if there is one knock on this place, it is the coffee. Although it is far more superior than chain-coffee shops, it falls short in comparison to the rest of the options in the neighbourhood. But don't hold that against them. This place is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place was a last ditch effort to get the java fix. The place has certain theme to it which might or might not appeal to you. I personally didn't like it. Ah well on to the cappuccino
Espresso:Weak
Crema': Meh
Milk: Poor
Latte Art: None
Poor attempt at cappuccino."}
{"text":"Cute and welcoming atmosphere with lots of stuff to catch your gaze and inspire your imagination. The staff were friendly and service was quick and efficient. They had a good selection of treats (baked in-house) and all the selections of coffee options you'd expect at a fair and reasonable price.  I had the dark drip coffe and a ginger cookie and enjoyed them both. I only wish this place was a bit closer to my home, so I could visit more frequently."}
{"text":"My second time here. This is a wonderful place and vibrant building. Friendly staff and home made baked goods."}
{"text":"Love this place. So unique and so much art. Such a quirky cafe. They have great taste in music too. Such a pleasure to sip on good coffee while listening to Radiohead, KOL and Arctic Monkeys! Fresh goods are baked daily. What more could you ask for!?"}
{"text":"Great variety of coffee drinks, cappuccinos, lattes

amazing savory danishes ,cakes, pastries, especially scones, croissants  

free book exchange

has quiet backroom, wheel chair accessible, Art Gallery, changing monthly"}
{"text":"This is the third time that I've been here.  It feels so friendly and home like. The staff and the proprietor are amazing.  The customers are friendly and chatty.
The tea is very good and they make the best café au lait that I have had in Toronto!
But the baking is where they stand out!  The chocolate croissants are always warm and the chocolate is runny!  But the Caramelized onion and cheddar croissant are superb!
My only question on the baking is since the proprietor is from Australia, why don't they have meat pies?
Don't miss this place.  It is a destination coffee spot"}
{"text":"We bump into this place once and tried the almond croissants, we fell in love. This are the best croissants we have tried so we usually plan a trip to come here since it is not close to us. We love this place, the atmosphere, the people and obviously the croissants."}
{"text":"So much character in such a small space. The Flying Pony is a very hip, eclectic coffee shop with artwork everywhere: on the sidewalk outside, hanging from the ceiling, decorating the walls and even in their washrooms.   

The cool as a cucumber hipster staff run a well oiled machine, cranking out their fair trade organic coffees and fresh baked pastries. Lots of take out traffic which crowds the front room. Do yourself a favor and take your goodies to the back room where you'll find more seating, as well as some peace and quiet.

WE ORDERED:
Butternut Squash soup - comforting and filling. It came with two tiny scraps of bread but MAN! Were they ever yummy! Crusty on the outside and soft in the middle. Went back to buy some more but they were already out. You gotta be early and quick here because they run out of their popular items.

Pastry with tomatoes, ricotta and basil - if you like bruschetta, you'll love this.

Chocolate Croissant - the chocolate filling was to die for!

Orange blossom (croissant dough flavored with orange zest with a sprinkling of sugar crystals) - I have died and gone to carb heaven! 

Bombay Fog - a London fog spiced with cardamom and topped with crushed pistachios. It was ok.

Cool place to hang out. Make sure to take a look at the art behind the buiding and alleyway."}
{"text":"The place is warm and welcoming . I ordered the Bombay Fog (basically a chai latte) and the pecan butter tart. This was the first time I've had the bombay fog so i cant really judge it, but it wasn't bad. The butter tart wasn't as flaky as I would have liked it but the filling was gooey and delicious."}
{"text":"What a great find - the staff is wonderful, the ambiance airy and relaxed, the baked goods coffee and espresso superb. Out of the way but worth the trip - already went back with friends."}
{"text":"****1/2 stars

I convinced my husband to check it this place on a weekend coffee jaunt. He was skeptical due to the colourful exterior (which I personally find fun and whimsical, especially the giant pigeon statue and amusing wildlife signage) but he left loving the place.

The interior is nice and inviting, a quiet spot to enjoy a coffee and one of the many delicious baked-in-house treats the Flying Pony has to offer. Walls are adorned with lots of great artwork available for purchase.

Now back to those baked goods... They were superb! Hubs had a cheddar scone and I tried the raspberry croissant. Both were insanely fresh and perfectly made.

Coffee (cappuccinos) was decent and service, while polite and helpful, did not seem entirely engaged in what she was doing. I'll still be back for sure though... this place is going to give my other favorite local bakery a run for its money!"}
{"text":"I walked into this place a few times... There's an art gallery near by my work was being shown in. I tried it out a few weeks ago and it was pretty good. The coffee was amazing. The carrot cake, not the best I've had, it gave me acid reflex, but the coffee is something I would definitely return for. And the ambiance of the place is super sweet too. It seems a little eclectic. I love the stained glass, it's so colourful and adds extra charm. :)"}
{"text":"I've been going past the Flying Pony for months without realising that it is a coffee shop. Might be because of the amazingly colourful storefront, which is somewhat typical of Little India.

Anyway, it is a very cute little coffee shop, with some nice eclectic furniture, giving it a rather hipstery vibe. It has lots of artwork, and nice large windows for lots of light. I did not have any of their pastries, but I did try their coffee. It was rather good, really no complaints there.

It was the service, however, that was a bit iffy. The barista did not seem overly enthused about serving me (I mean... I'm not that bad of a guest, I hope!), and just had a rather catty vibe to him that I did not like. I do like chatty baristas who strike up a convo, but this guy felt so negative I just did not want to even talk to him. So that kind of coloured my whole experiences somewhat negatively, and I do not feel as if I would want to go back there on my own. Maybe with friends, or something, but it is definitely out of the question as a study-spot for me."}
{"text":"The more I visit this cafe, the more I'm in love with it!
While being sick, this was one of the closest place to grab soups and pastries that I know are freshly baked.
The service is never disappointing. They're always ready to put up a good recommendation. Cause I'm always indecisive with the variety that they have to offer from coffee to pastries to sweet treats. 
It's definitely your neighbourhood cafe to go too and much more."}
{"text":"I always find the coffee here to taste exceptionally awful (I live maybe 30 seconds away and I have only visited twice because of how bad the coffee tastes), however the baked goods are actually quite delicious. But there are far better coffee options in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Coffee was nice and fresh. Cookies (oatmeal chocolate chip and double chocolate) were scrumptious. Male server today was very warm and kind."}
{"text":"Had an hour or so to spare so stopped by to grab a drink and a snack. The decor was very artsy but it seemed more like a regular cafe than an art gallery. The staff was nice and all the guests seemed to enjoy the service.

The drinks were mediocre, maybe coffee is more their specialty so can't comment on that. But the hot chocolate and tea was overpriced, could have gotten the same thing at one of the chain stores and the taste would be alike. The pastries and baked good looked quite appealing from behind the counter. Got a savoury croissant to munch on while lounging around and chatting with a friend. Probably should have asked them to heat the pastry a bit since it wasn't to go. It was room temperature which was fine but it might have tasted better warm. Guess it would feel more freshly baked psychologically.

Overall, wouldn't be coming back."}
