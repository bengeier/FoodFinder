{"text":"This location has really gone down hill in the last year or so.  Have always loved their sandwiches, soups (for the most part but they've slipped too) and grab and go items but their breakfasts on Thursday and Friday mornings and their buffet lunch has just gone to pot.

High turn over in kitchen staff results in the strangest choices and array of less than appealing dishes for lunch.  Theirs no focus - too many different dishes that don't even go well together.  

Breakfast is always a risk.  Food is either under or over cooked.  The fritatas they cook up are way too greasy and this morning it was undercooked and topped with enough cheese to stop anybodies heart.  As well, you simply can't serve sausages pink.  they need to ease up on the amount of fake hollandaise sauce they pour over the eggs benedict too!

Where is the quality control here?  It's so sad.  They used to be top notch."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in downtown Calgary with friends or colleagues and you're having a hard time setting on one type of cuisine that suits everyone's tastes, then head to Marcello's market and deli.  They've got a little something for everyone.  They've got both a custom sandwich counter and already prepared sandwiches available.  As well, they have a large selection of fruits, salads, and desserts.  Those looking for hotter, more substantial fare can belly up to the buffet, which featured roast chicken and pot roast the day I was there.  I had the Giovanni Italian sandwich, which had prosciutto, smoked turkey, capicollo, and provolone on a bun, and it cost $4.99.  For a loaded 8\" sub, the price was certainly reasonable and the fresh ingredients made for a tasty lunch.  The only negative about the place that I can think of is the chaos of the sandwich area - there's no orderly flow of traffic.  Sometimes it seems like you're swimming upstream to get your lunch, but such is life."}
{"text":"This is the second Marcelos to open up in the downtown core. It is located in Canterra Tower on the second floor.

You can get pre-made and made to order sandwiches, salads, mini pizzas (yum!), war won ton soup (yum!), many varieties of soup daily and a variety of hot dish items like chinese foods all the way down to homemade stuffed mushrooms!

One of the chef's is allergic to wheat and dairy so she writes on the glass above each item if it has wheat or dairy in it! Super helpful because I am also allergic to the same things!

You can get coffee, tea, juice, pop, milk as well.  Kristy (the owner) also makes these yummy cute mini pitas stuffed with chicken and tuna all in a little container with a piece of cheese and veggies with dip!

They have awsome won ton soup! yum!

If you want to try one of their mini pizzas you just have to pick a crust and then pick how many toppings you want and in a mere few minutes *shazam!* you have a yumm-i-lisous pizza!

Kristy (the owner) has the same name as me and because of that I've gotten to know her more, she's really nice and down to earth.  She take her buisness VERY seriously...so if you have a concern or a request she will always be there to hear you out.

Yes some of the prices are a little up there like the buffet style items that are weighed at the register, but its nice to try something new from their menu  :)"}
{"text":"The food is a bit hit or miss here, and like most hot/cold buffets, your eyes can be bigger than your stomach - so buyer beware, your lunch could be incredibly expensive. It is, however, a great place to sample different foods, great vegetarian selection if you require it for your dietary needs and one of my favourite places to sneak in some mac n' cheese with a side of veggies. A bit heavy on the oils...and steer clear of the Sheppard's pie if the potato topping looks dry."}
{"text":"I pick up a little something from here on most days. The price is great and the quality acceptable given its downtown location. The salad bar is great."}
{"text":"This place literally has everything.

It's always fresh and they never run out of anything.  Although it's a little pricey, but I still get my salad with all my favourite toppings for around $7.  No complains.  Their front staff is fast - even when it is busy, you're in and out at lunch time."}
{"text":"I eat here and recommend the food to my clients only because it offers healthy choices. It's ok tasting. Clean and local."}
{"text":"The concept is wonderful. Buffet style, make your own salad. Even add some of the hot food items. But then I realized that the quality was going sideways. The day I bit into a rotten egg was the last straw. ( this was at the 7th street location) But then I found a new location-414 3rd st SW. Really nice food. Wonderful selection. Mashed potatoes, steamed veggies, beautiful salad bar etc. Soon I was horrified to see the owners of the other location lurking. Then it was obvious they bought it when the food changed to mostly deep fried garbage. You see the same food recycled. So gross. I'm done. Don't spend your money there. It's not even a one star."}
{"text":"Marcello's is a convienient place for breakfast and lunch.  For lunch they have fresh or pre-wrapped sandwitches, hot soup, pastries, squares, friut, drinks and there is a buffet with more heavier options (like chicken, beef, stir-fry, pasta, etc.) that are sold by the weight.  For breakfast there are assorted pastries and coffee available.  Though there are tables, they are usually full; thus, it's more of a grab-and-go venue.  The staff are friendly and prices reasonable for downtown.  Try to get there before lunch hour to avoid the long line-ups.  This place closes early as well, around 4:00 pm, so it isn't an option after hours.  Though the food isn't insipiring, if you are looking for something quick and cheap this is a good option."}
{"text":"Used to be a regular here for lunches but no more.  Between the quiet price increase and quality going down hill. Final straw was buying the mini pita and veggies lunch.  Got back to my office. One pita was missing.  And the one hidden under the others had a bite out of it.  Totally grossed out. Wrote them online. They responded.  Said the manager had done the pitas and apologized for cutting them incorrectly. Didn't even address the half eaten one. But offered me a 50% discount on my next purchase. If that offer is good for Any place but theirs I will take them up on it.  Otherwise they won't be seeing me again"}
{"text":"This is super close to my work so frequent it quite a bit when I am too lazy to make a lunch (which seems to be every day).  I usually get their made to order sangies which are super good and fresh.  I buy their salads a lot too (BLT is my fav) and sometimes the pre-packaged mini pitas with side veggies mmmm.  I usually don't hit up their buffet but it is always lined up so they must be doing something right.  I did have some soup today and it brought me back to when I was 6 months old (not a good thing).  I'm not saying that I remember what food tasted like when I was less than a year old, but this had to have been pretty close to this soup.  It was the cream of veg, maybe should be called lump of veg instead.  I have only had soup/chili a few times here but it has been underwhelming every time.  Stick with the fresh sandwich bar and packaged salads and you should be good.  

p.s. watch out for the dessert cooler while you wait in line to pay, it can be very tempting, especially if you are hungry.  

20/30"}
{"text":"So went hier at lunch time it was pretty full inside the food options are so much you can decide if you want to go with just salad or the hot dishes and omg they have so much variety with European food , Indian food, Italian food ... 
so I got chicken biryani and, rice with butter chicken  and sweet sour chicken and salad and everything was very tasty. 
You can decide if you want to dine in or have it as a take out which is amazing for working peoples who don't have a long lunch break.
I would definitely recommend that place of u in a hurry to pick up ur lunch.
P.s i forgot to take pictures was to hungry"}
{"text":"Marcello's is a great lunch time staple that delivers in terms of variety and quality of food. The salad bar is consistently fresh and has a variety of greens to choose from as well as 12 different types of dressing and more than 20 toppings to put in the salad. The cold food table has prepared salads, pasta salads, and the hot food table changes daily but usually has some form of rice, roasted veggies, meats, soups and sides to choose from. Its very easy to put together a healthy balanced lunch with the offerings at Marcello's. 

You're charged by weight and the price is $1.99/100g. If you come in after 3pm, their price goes down to $0.99/100g which is a steal. Bare in mind, the salad bar is closed and you only have access to the cold/hot tables but still a great deal. 

A great option for lunch if you're looking for a healthier option."}
{"text":"This place had really great selections, anything you could think of under the sun. I just found their salad bar items overall too oily and not healthy enough. The hot items like eggplant and mushrooms were great, but left me feeling kind of sick. Could just be my sensitivity to certain cooking oils, as I don't often use them, so perhaps others would enjoy the food here. Service was really good though, one time I had two boxes by accident (stuck together) and the cashier noticed and saved me paying for the weight of the second layer."}
{"text":"Got yogurt and fruit today for breakfast. The yogurt was SOUR and the fruit not so fresh. Was not impressed considering I got a small portion with a few fruits and it cost me over 6 dollars. Don't think I'll try it again unless I have no other options."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Olly Fresco's in Bow Valley every day. So when I took a job that was no where close to that, I had to find a new place for lunch. I was excited when I discovered Marcello's. However, my excitement didn't last for long. 

They have a good coffee selection but was disappointed to know they really don't give a discount if you bring in your own to go cup. That's crap.

I have sampled their soup and found some to be good, others not so good. The chicken gumbo was so fucking hot my lips burned for an hour after eating it. Yeah I threw that shit in the garbage. The beef barely was ok but nothing spectacular. The cream of mushroom was very good but I'm sure it wasn't low fat. What totally brings down the soup here is that they have the same 5 kinds every single day. They never change the variety. WTF? Do they think we don't want something different? I don't understand that and decided this place only gets 2 stars mainly for this.

Their hot buffet also doesn't seem to have much variety. They have the same thing week after week. A lot of the food in the buffet looks unappetizing and like it's been sitting under the heat lamps for days. It also isn't that tasty. I've certainly had much better.  Again, only worthy of a couple of stars.

There is a salad bar with a half decent variety but I couldn't seem to find any dressings other than some little plastic containers already measured out. 

The shrimp salad roll I had the other day was ok. The shrimp in it seemed like they were cut in half so I felt cheated.  But the sauce wasn't like a peanut sauce and that was disappointing. Would not recommend them.

Try Marcello's at your own risk."}
{"text":"Such a convenient way to grab some breakfast on the way to work in the morning! The selection was great and everything I chose tasted delicious."}
{"text":"Again... I really give this place a 2.5 star! (We need HALF stars, Yelp!)

One of the potentially most expensive fast food places in the Financial District is Marcello's. While their by-the-weight buffet is very good, fresh and delicious: their hot food is actually HOT and their salad selections COLD, depending on what you fancy, it could get pricey. (I think it's approximately $1.55/ 100g). Bonus for vegetarians: they serve stir-fried veggies at breakfast too! One regrettable point for health nuts: their food is quite salty. 

However, not everything is expensive here, such as their soups. I was pleased to find that they have a good selection of soups each day, at least one of their soups is meat free. Bonus for everyone: Marcello's soups are cheaper than SOUP IT UP's soups, which is right next door. 

Today I had their vegetarian chili and it was GOOD, very similar to Soup It Up's veggie chili. While Marcello's veg chili does not have as many veggies in it as its neighbor's, it had alot of white and kidney beans and a huge tomato presence. Although I wish it had a bigger variety of veggies, I still found it very tasty and obviously memorable. I would totally come back for their veggie chili and veggie soups, but I'll probably shy away from the buffet. 

ONE truly bad thing: They don't take plastics, cash only.

Oh yea, I'm here all the time... due to the lack of good hot veggie entrees near my office. It's just pure laziness (and lack of time) I tell ya!"}
{"text":"Marcello's is pretty tucked in and if it was for a friend who took me here. I don't think I would have found it. Solid 3.5 stars. We can here for lunch and the food was buffet style by weight. I selected the fish and it was jerk fish and a regular fish. Both flavour were good and nicely marinated.
If I remember how to walk back here, I will go back by myself!"}
{"text":"A place to buy breakfast, lunch, or coffee for on the go.

They have a hot food buffet for both breakfast and lunch time along with an omelette station, sandwich station, and pastries.

They have la rocca cakes in stock for that office birthday event.

Their coffee tastes just ok and you make it yourself.

Hot foods is decent but doesnt have the biggest selection compared to Olly Fresco or even Longos."}
{"text":"Great selection, good value for the money and great tasting!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"SOOOO many options here. I love to come here on days when I feel like a big breakfast, when a breakfast sandwich from timmies just won't cut it. 

I've only ever tried food from their buffet bar. 

There is a large selection breakfast options (scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, meatballs, soup, breakfast burritos, salads, quiche, pancakes, potatoes, fries, chicken.....And even sushi!!). 

During lunch, menu only gets better. They tend to switch it up, but I love their butter chicken, chicken briyani, general Tao chicken, and Korean glass noodles). There's also lots of salad options but who really wants a salad? 

Only thing that's keeping me from giving it a 5/5 is that it kinda smells here, and feels very dingy. But then again, the entirety of the Scotia food court is dingy."}
{"text":"Quite a poppin' lunch spot. I heard they have an amazing breakfast buffet, but since most breakie foods aren't vegan-friendly, I've never been during that time.

I call this place 'the ratchet marche' because the concept is very similar but it's like a run-down version of the classier, more upscale, better quality brother. Don't get me wrong, the place is good still! The prices are cheap and I come here for some vegetables or extra carbs on my lunch hour sometimes and so do my coworkers - one got a small side of salad for 75 cents. WORTH!! 

It's all based on weight but I found even a full carby and veggie filled meal was only about $11 while the same thing at marche was over $20.. Marcello's food is usually fresh and there are many options. Their veggies are good but their pasta/carbs are soooo oily, it didn't sit well in my stomach.

The staff that work here are very nice and overall I'd definitely come back to grab either a side for my lunch or a full meal. Yum."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come if you want a little of this and a little of that.  It can get a tad expensive if you pick up heavy items like perhaps a baked potato.

They have the most AMAZING Tabouli.

Has everything from Chinese food, to Greek, to Tuna Salad, to Pasta, To Indian, to Moroccan, Excellent Jamaican and Jerk food...every day they switch the menu up.

The Caribbean food is the real-deal. Makes for a good change in you grab a container and choose a little bit of this, and a little bit of that.  However, if you choose too much it can be rather costly.

Breakfast hours they serve various types of eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns etc too.

They have pizza but it is not good (I wouldn't recommend that).  If you go to the back they can make you sandwiches and wraps (to order) and also have soups.

The buffet is really good though with plenty of hot and cold items to choose from."}
{"text":"In love with this place!! Amazing yummy food and wonderful  service ! Variety of different foods to try."}
{"text":"Hairy Eats! 10% of the time I get a hair in my soup/sandwich."}
{"text":"I am torn with this place. On the one hand, this is where my department orders the departmental breakfasts, but on the other hand, this place is a wee bit pricey.  The price for coffees/teas is reasonably. Sadly, there is no almond milk as alternative to regular milk & cream.  But the prices for the food buffet are too much because it's by the pound and it adds up immediately.

I do like that they have chocolates, crisps, yogurts, fruits, cheese for that mid-day snack attack, particularly yogurts.

My colleagues who order from here have had very good experiences with the management in their catering needs.

The coffee line-up in the morning runs very smoothly and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"For a subterranean, downtown, food court restaurant, Marcello's is really good.   While the by-the-weight buffet is clearly the most popular option, those in the know scoot over to the sandwich/pizza counter to get their nosh.   

The pizzas are surprisingly good - a personal, three-topping pizza with good choices like spinach, chicken breast, bacon etc is a little shy of $6 with 75 cents extra for a can of pop.    The staff behind the counter are great and will quickly remember your preferences so you don't need to ask anymore.

On Thursdays, be sure to visit the buffet for Troy's rotis.   Only once per week, but these are the authentic thing - spicy and filling.   One caveat on the roti is that, due to a potato, meat, and sauce filling they can be a little heavy (read: expensive ~$8ish).    Well worth it though.  

Take-out only."}
{"text":"While I find Marcello's lunches decent but nothing special, their breakfasts on Thursdays and Fridays are a different thing altogether.  These two special days of the week, this particular location serves their hot breakfast buffet and has quickly become my favourite stop for a fast, hot breakfast in the morning.  Scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, hashbrowns, waffles and even eggs benedict are part of the choices.  

The eggs benedict are so very nice.  The traditional English muffin, ham, egg and hollandaise sauce with a bit of paprika sprinkled on top.  The hollandaise may not be from scratch, but it sure is satisfying.  The sausages are awesome (kind of hard to screw sausage up) and the hash browns are seasoned and tasty.  Can't argue all of that for under $10.  The cheapo in me is happy with that price.  The hungry roaring lion in me is purring and meowing by the end of this breakfast."}
{"text":"Great value for the PATH location. By-the-weight buffet (hot and cold) is much cheaper than supermarkets in the PATH. 
They are always trying something new, like a massive cold buffet station  (as large as the hot buffet) with many unique items.

Hot breakfast is on tap until closer to 11am, cold buffet is always open. Hot buffet is always changed up, different menu each day.  I drop by any time during the day and always finding something - including deserts - that fits the bill. Prices are very good. The Manager is always around, say hi to him. Most staff are there for a while. Full range of Van Houtte coffees. 

Really their selection of hot/cold and breakfast buffets, muffins/donuts/tarts/etc, deserts, pizza, sandwiches, snacks, coffees, drinks is why I go. One stop shop for whatever strikes your mood."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here before and it wasn't bad. This review is based on the outrageous price they charged for some fruits. I have attached a photo of the fruit I purchased. It was $8. Enough said."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for the price.  As of right this moment it's about 1.59per 100g which is crazy for the path.  Other supermarkets are a lot more expensive at 2.49 etc.  A tip for those new to the buffet lunch is that don't get the bones they add up the price! :)

Thursday is Caribbean day and they have pretty good doubles there if you are a fan.  Eat here regularly my only complaint is sometimes they go a bit too hard on the oils."}
{"text":"They have desserts here.. yummm.. I tried the raspberry cake (pretty good) and I think there may be pistachios in it?

$4.16 for tasty dessert. If the price point was lower, I may love this place."}
{"text":"Quick, fast, and yummy!  They actually TOAST your breakfast sandwich unlike Tim Horton's that ends up being a slightly brown, but still limp English Muffin.  Ingredients are fresh.  Beware - items like pasta and potatoes can be heavy and therefore expensive."}
{"text":"There's no way to beat around this particular bush...its expensive.  Having said that, you get great quality food for the hard earned dollars you part with.  Several hot dishes such as roast beef or turkey, several pasta dishes, a big salad bar, and a number of other nice selections are available.  Sticker shock is extreme at the till but you'll love the way it tastes.  Chalk one up for rich yuppies, this one's for you."}
{"text":"Since my work is super close to this location, it's usually my \"go to\" place for lunch. There is a really good variety of foods and all seem pretty fresh. The reason why I am giving it only 2/5 stars is because of their poor customer service behind the deli counter. I thought I would give it a try because I have never had lunch from that part of Marcello's - needless to say I will never do that again. Being a first timer, I was a bit confused as to how you went about ordering and what was available for lunch time. My few simple questions received very short-tempered, snippy answers from one of the ladies. I don't know if she is the supervisor, manager or just another worker but she definitely put a sour taste in my mouth.

The outcome? I ended up getting a simple BLT sandwich for $5.99 because I had no idea what I was doing. I understand that they are busy during this hour, but there was no one behind me and no need to push myself and my order through the line! The cashier couldn't even point out a manager for me to raise my simple concern.

I recommend Marcello's as a whole but I don't suggest ordering from the deli counter - rude, rude, rude!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites places to have lunch in downtown, everything is fresh and delicious!.. And the menu changes everyday,  I could have lunch here everyday and never be bored!!... They have salads, and soups and fresh food.... I am definitely a big fan of Marcellos!!"}
{"text":"I love the croissants here. They bake them in the morning and they're super fluffy yet crispy on the outside. The breakfast selection is super good all different types of eggs, fruits etc and you can make your own omelette as well"}
{"text":"Yay, I'm a fan!
No really, I AM a fan.  A big one.. of Marcello's.

If you're looking for a quick lunch at a reasonable price, look no further.  Now, I have to say.  I'm not the biggest fan of the hot buffet!  I know, I know, I'll probably get my head tore off for this, but I'm not!  I much prefer their coffee, their soups, the salads, the custom sandwich bar? Yes.  The soups are great because they offer dairy AND gluten free!  

The salads are always fresh and priced anywhere from $4.50 - $6.50.  Some people have reviewed Marcello's saying it's pricey, but for the freshness of vegetables and quality, I think it's worth is. Very simple flavours, but tastes like homemade.  Can't go wrong.

Um, the custom sandwich bar.. you get PICKLES ON THE SIDE?!?!!? Pickles, people. Pickles are wicked.  I find the service there is pretty spot on.  Fast, efficient, sometimes grouchy, but it's super busy , I don't blame them.

They have this HUGE cooler in the middle all filled with DESSERTS.  I encourage you to try their in-store made rice pudding with cinnamon and raisins for 2 bucks.  They also have squares, cookies, cakes.  Most of which are NOT made by Marcello's, but definitely good variety.

The seating isn't super ample and kind of covers the front, but there is additional seating downstairs provided by the building where they allow you to eat your lunch. 

Don't forget about Marcello's for breakfast! On Thursdays and Fridays they offer a breakfast buffet (charged by weight) with french toast, waffles, fruit, bacon, so much good stuff.  Also, they offer hard boiled eggs in the cooler or yogurts to go.  

Try and get in before noon as it gets really busy, and super packed.  You'll encounter that awkward \"uh, excuse me.\" \"Uh, sorry\" \"uh, sorry about that\"


So next time you're in Calgary Place or near the area, grab your water cooler companion and come on in for some delicious food you don't have to feel guilty about after you've eaten it."}
{"text":"Good news! It's taken over new ownership and it's amazing now!  They have power bowls, delicious sandwich bar, hot fresh buffet and more!  This one might even be better than the one in 5th ave place !  Come here and test out the new and improved Marcello's, I promise you'll be so happy you did"}
{"text":"This place is good if you're a rich yuppie who can afford to spend more than $10 every lunch.  Okay, that may sound pretty harsh, but it's totally true.  Allow me to quickly explain.

There is a great selection of different food to choose from.   They have everything from pre-packaged sandwiches to delicious on-the-spot pastas and soups.  Everything is always good, no matter what you get.  

Unfortunately, everything is also pretty expensive.  The only truly good deal I've found at Marcello's are the little packages of single-serving cheeses.  Now those are wicked.  Other than that, I can't bring myself to buy lunch here anymore because it hurts my wallet too much.  

I wish it wasn't as expensive because it would be a really awesome place to have lunch!  I can't go every day, but I go sometimes because it is a nice place."}
{"text":"Always great service and fresh food!

-tons of coffee flavors and roasts, muffins are good too!
-lots of food items to choose from
-fair price

Great staff especially the African-american men at the deli, and the blond guy who works many positions (Sorry don't know their names)"}
