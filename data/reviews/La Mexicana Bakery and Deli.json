{"text":"We went to pick up the cake for my sister's wedding.  She had called hours ahead to ask what was the latest we could pick up the cake.  She was advised they closed at 9 p.m.  I get there and the girl was doing nothing but complain how, I quote, my sister made them suffer by coming to pick up the cake so late.  End quote.  It was 8:20, by the way.  I was about to apologize when I see their bakery hours are until 9.  When I asked what time was their closing (to confirm) she said 9 but they wanted to close early because of Easter Sunday.   I advised her that next time she should notify her customers of the time they wished to close.  We would have had no problem picking up the cake at an earlier time had we known.  Not getting more of my business and DEFINITELY not recommending this place to any yelper out there."}
{"text":"Had my son's 3rd birthday cake done here. We had seen some of their work and heard great things. I was extremely pleased with their prices, I've purchased many many cakes and never one this cheap. Not only was the cake extremely affordable but it was perfect, exactly like the picture I left with them and to top it all off, it was DELICIOUS! I opted for the regular white cake since the lady at the counter informed me their regular cake is really good and almost as juicy as the traditional Mexican tres leches cake and she was not lying, I actually liked that cake better than most other tres leches cakes I've tried."}
{"text":"The cakes flavors are really good, they give you different options and a wide variety of fillings. The prices are very affordable too."}
{"text":"This place messed up my order and blame me for the mistake. Wen I tried to complain the bakery gave me the cold shoulder and refuse to apologize."}
