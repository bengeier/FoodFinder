{"text":"Decent food, Burgers are really good. This place used to be really really good but the last couple years the portion sizes have gone down and the prices have gone up.  It used to be a good deal but now it is not worth it.  It's a shame, Middleburg does not have too many good places for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"14 Oz steak, potatoes, salad for 12.00. You Can't Beat it!!!  Try the buffalo wings also"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  The owner is the worst part of it all.  They do not care about getting or keeping customers and it shows"}
{"text":"Babes Sports Grille is amazing!  I hosted a fundraising event for my father to raise funds for his cancer treatment.  Anthony the owner was easy to work with and up front with everything regarding hosting an event at his bar.  We ended up having 117 people come out for the event and everyone had a great time!!!  Everyone was raving about the food and said it was one of the best fundraising events they have been to.  The all you can eat food table remained stocked throughout the event.  The all you can drink draft beers were constantly being poured/handed out with very little to no wait time so your ticket price at the door was definitely worth it.  This is also one of the cleanest bars I think I have ever been to which is a big PLUS!!!  The music and lighting also added to the fun!  Cant say anything negative about the night since everything ran so smoothly!  Definitely would recommend Babes for a fun night out or a fundraising event!"}
{"text":"On February 19, 2011, I took a large party to Babe's for an engagement party. The owners, Anthony & John were rude to our party of 30 people. We decided to leave and were heckled by Anthony and an off-duty Middleburg Hts. police officer that was moon-lighting as security.  Our disruption was one of our guest went outside in the snow to smoke. After finishing her cigarette, she didn't exhale all the smoke outside and was entering back inside when the off-duty police officer told her she is not allowed back inside. It wasn't until several minutes later when another person in our party informed us that she was not allowed in and needed her coat. I informed the owners Anthony & John that if they were not going to let her back inside, our party of 30 people would have to leave. Anthony waved his hand and said \"bye-bye\"  Anthony and the off-duty officer proceeded to say \"don't come back\" then the off-duty police officer followed our group several store fronts away from Babe's, while calling his on-duty police officer partner on his cell phone (not thru dispatch) and said \"if you come now, you could arrest them down by the Dollar General store\".   There intent was to cause harm to my family and friends.  I live 2-blocks away from Babe's and have observed the empty parking lot. I look forward to a new owner and patronizing Babe's once again."}
{"text":"Came to have drinks with some friends over the holidays.  The bar is a lot nicer on the inside than you would expect, and the bartenders were friendly and efficient.  They also had some pretty intense trivia going on along with plenty of TVs to watch the college bowl games.  Pretty much everything you need in a bar environment.  Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to sample the food that evening because I was on a strict liquid diet.  Based on my one experience there, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Went for a wedding as a guest, bought 8-10 drinks for myself (vodka and cranberries) felt little to no buzz. Either very weak drinks or watered down liquor. Very unhappy with that. The food was good but the chicken seemed a little undercooked (I wasn't the only one to notice this..). The owner went up to the bride during the reception and told her the balance, I don't believe that was the right thing to do either. Way to be all about money."}
{"text":"Terrible. My food was burnt so i returned it and they charged for 10$ min. And my drink. So I said charge me for the Burnt food it would be less.  They would not do it.  No air conditioning no fans. The servers great the owner must be going broke  he charged us no matter what. No customer appreciation"}
{"text":"The bar is one large open room with tables, booths and couches. There is a dance floor and pool table. There are at least 25 seats at the bar- so plenty of room for everyone. Lots of TV' s for sports viewing. We always had a drink in front of us and our food was served hot and fast."}
{"text":"Babe's is a very spacious bar with a lot of tables but heaps of bar stools too.  The bar snakes through the whole backside so you have a good view of the whole establishment.  They also have a large patio.  I was here for a fundraiser and the pizza they served was fantastic!  The service was also excellent.  Our bartender came out from behind the bar to our table many times to see if we needed anything else.  She was also attentive to clearing our empties.  A few times people at our table asked for different TV stations to be put on and it wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"Babe's is close to home, so it's convenient to stop in when I just want a quick bite and drink without having to stress about \"getting ready\" to go to dinner. I've been 3 or 4 times now and had the same waitress each time. She's really efficient, nice and attentive. I've typically stuck with their burgers which are adequate. Sometimes overcooked and a bit dry, but doable I guess. On my most recent visit I tried the fish sandwich w/ hush puppies. The fish was a square pattie, like the kind you get from the Schwan truck. Surprise #1. Surprise #2 was that they served it burnt. What cook and server worth anything thinks that's ok to put in front of a customer? Surprise #3: The hush puppies were overcooked, dry and flavorless. I took the fish out of the bun and put it in the middle of the plate, called the server over and said \"this needs to be recooked correctly.\" Surprise #4...food delivered with a still overcooked fish sandwich, although not as bad as round 1, and the same hush puppies as round 1...not replaced. Whatever!!! I ate....2 hush puppies and 1/2 the sandwich. My partner ordered the patty melt, which was served with no onions or cheese. Just a patty on rye bread. Our friendly waitress bought me a drink and explained there was a brand new cook. Seems to me that cook should have the shortest tenure in the food industry and go away.   Babe's: You're menu is simple, why can't you cook your food accordingly? For convenience I want to continue to patronize, but that food needs a serious upgrade. Keep the menu...just find someone who knows how to cook, and quit buying your product in a can or freezer bag. It's less expensive and more tasteful to use fresh.   I really don't know if I'll be back. Am gonna shop around for a few months I think."}
