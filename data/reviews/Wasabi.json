{"text":"A good restaurant has to have good customer service and this place was far from it. As an all-you-can-eat buffet, one would think that the customer can order as many dishes as he/she likes. This was not so.

When I went there with my friends, we ordered a wide range of sushi, sashimi, appetizers as well as other dishes. The waitress gave us a very condescending look (as if we were starving pigs!?!?) and thought we couldn't finish everything we ordered. I wonder what would the waitress expect from working at an all you can eat buffet restaurant? Obviously, there will be people ordering a lot of food. If not, why would it be an all you can eat restaurant?

She goes on to point out the fee charged on any leftover food. Since we accepted the fee that is there, I would expect that the food we ordered would come and if there are leftovers, that's just my problem. It turns out that they missed so many of the dishes we ordered as if there's poor organization or they're just skimping on the food.

Whatever it is, I wouldn't go back there. It's priced at a typical buffet rate but the food is really just average and the customer service is beyond savable."}
{"text":"Good food, but painfully slow service. They messed up my friend's order and took 45 mins to fix it. Hard to understand when we were one of the two tables in the whole place. Meh. There are so many better restaurants out there, I'd say pass on this one--especially if you don't have three hours to wait for your meal."}
{"text":"I went there a few weeks ago, in the mood for hot soup. The waitress sat the two of us by the window (coldest spot in the restaurant with bad red glare from the neon light) and gave us the all-you-can-eat menus. I hadn't realized it was that kind of restaurant, but just went with it. 

Service: ok. She brought everything we ordered (in waves) and took a second order. The place was quite busy. 

Quality: the white tuna and unagi were the best. The hand rolls were ok but had too much mayo. The maki was ok. Other sashimi was sub-par. 

When we paid up front I saw the regular menus. I would have preferred to order from there. The waitress and chefs were all speaking Chinese.

Overall: Too expensive for what it is. Wouldn't go back for all-you-can-eat. Might try it again from the regular menu, only because it's walking distance from home."}
{"text":"Perhaps prices have gone up since the rest of the reviewers ate at Wasabi, because it wasn't cheap. I generally eat whichever lunch special is cheapest when I stumble into random sushi places, but the cheapest lunch special listed here was $12 something. Instead I had a hamachi roll for 6.50 and miso soup for 1.50. Both were fine, but nothing to write home about. If they were super cheap I would have been happy enough. But they weren't, so I felt like I overpaid.

I'll likely eat here again because I work nearby and sometimes forget to (/am too lazy to) pack my lunch, but I'll try every other place on the street first. The hard, cold booth seating, a very very loud upright fridge, and fully mediocre service, in addition to the mediocre food, do nothing to entice me back any sooner."}
{"text":"What a disappointment the restaurant looked so cute and is so close to my new place. $21.99 for dinner Saturday night which is pricey but tolerable except the maki was all rice no stuffing and the fluffiest most filling unappetizing rice I ever had. It felt like they were deliberately trying to fill you up quickly to cut a bigger profit. The sushi looked lifeless and the gyoza was yucky. I have had supermarket sushi that was so much better and we felt like we were begging and inconveniencing the waitress every time we ordered more food. In the end 50$ two people and we felt yucky, frustrated and disappointed."}
{"text":"Wasabi is a relatively new Sushi restaurant. They have an all you can eat sushi deal, which is what I will be writing about.

I'm not sure if this is on purpose or not, but it seems that they do everything possible to make sure you eat as less sushi as possible. Some things that happened:

* They simply forget stuff that you ordered. This is not so strange of course, as they do not write anything down. I've been there with a group of four and ordering like a dozen of items for the first round and the waitress did not write anything down. Maybe things got lost in the kitchen.

* An order is 'one piece'. We were with a group of four and ordered the Chicken Yakitori. How many skewers did we get? Eight? Four? No, just one to share with four people. Did the waitress mention this when we ordered? Did she ask us how many? No. Same thing happened with the other items of which you expect to get at least a good amount.

* Service is slow. I'm used to all you can eat sushi places where you make a good order and the table will be full within a reasonable time. Not so much at this place. You get some items, eat those and then the table is empty and everybody is wondering when the rest of the food will come.

One star because the food is of reasonable quality. I will not go back though. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Adding my two cents:

I have to agree with the other reviewers. I live in the area and am looking for some competition price wise (Osaka down the street but SUUUPER expensive there, so we walked in and then out and back to Wasabi). We keep going back for AYCE.

However it never surprises us at about $20/person when we get sllooow hit and miss service, and hit and miss sushi. Once they forgot our order of fried bananas and waited 35 minutes, even after being told that the chef had forgotten about us, and the place is never that busy on a weekday night when we've been around.

Whenever we go there are jerks with their cellphones turned up super high, and crazy bored young children screaming and leaving their seats.
There is a cash discount so bring it.
Watch out for the weird hours and moment of store closure between 3-5pm. I've seen them in there cleaning while tired customers finish their AYCE lunch behind a CLOSED sign.

About time to try some Roncesvailles sushi instead..."}
{"text":"as far as service goes, man is this place awful. I generally don't complain about service but this place takes it to a whole new level as far as terrible goes. I've never been to a restaurant where they just don't bring you what you order. We tried the AYCE, ordered a lot of stuff, but when it came to the sushi, it wasn't like they brought the wrong thing, or brought something cold or undercooked, I think what happened was, they took our order, then just decided, screw it, these people don't deserve to eat sushi today. We reminded them around 4 times but it just didn't happen for us (we heard another lady complaining that they didnt get around 5 dishes either and waited very long for nothing).

to sum up, mediocre food, ultra slow service, pretty bad interior decor. I think it is safe to say I'm never coming back and regret even trying them out. The only reason I think people come here is that they probably live around keele and bloor and are too lazy to drive to any other japanese place. Im pretty sure any other japanese restaurant would be better.

(Need to mention this Wasabi in no way resembles Wasabi restaurants found in Markham. I'm pretty sure they are the same by name only)"}
{"text":"There was a time in my life when I thought this was the greatest thing ever. Too bad I met Oishi Sushi and it turned my world upside down.

Although this place offers all you can eat Japanese food; that's all it offers. Plus they only give you an hour to do so. Which in a buffet situation would normally be more than enough time but with the slow-a$$ service they provide then you barely get enough in you to feel full. This being the reason upon which at later visits to the restaurant in my life I sat down and immediately ordered everything I could possibly want. The only problem with this being that if you have any left overs they charge you extra for it.

Good place though. Nice and clean. Nice atmosphere. Washrooms are fully automatic. Don't have to touch anything. It's great.

If your in the East end of Toronto there's no reason not to hit this place up if you want all you can eat Japanese food."}
{"text":"Cafésta is the rebranded Wasabi restaurant.  The décor may not have changed much, but everything else has improved since our last visit (August 2009).

Service:  5 stars.  We were seated immediately.  Tea, wasabi, pickled ginger all arrived at our table without asking.  The staff was very attentive and responsive to our questions and needs (aka kids).  We also received everything we ordered.

Food:  4.5 stars for selection and yumminess.  Adults receive a complimentary main course (not AYCE).  My wife and I ordered the lamb chops.  Excellent.  (Other choices included buttered lobster and a special sushi platter.)  The starter soup -- a lobster bisque -- was delightful.  (I had two bowls.)

The AYCE menu wasn't entirely mainstream.  While we ordered an assortment of sashimi, sushi, and teppanyaki, we also tried the  oxtail in red wine sauce, deep fried durian, and jellyfish salad.  Tempura batter was light and crispy.  Beef (e.g., sliced beef with green onions, short ribs, or sirloin steak) was tender and tasty.  Soft drinks are included -- I couldn't resist getting an ice cream float.

p.s., the menu states there's a time limit of 1.5 hrs.  I don't know how strictly that is enforced.

Cafésta exceeded our expectations. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Open summer 2009! Fast forward to November now open!

One of my friends lives in the area and have waited very patiently for this place to open to give it a try. The moment I walked in the walls were covered in wasabi, well, it was painted green so it lived up to its name. It is very small with limited seating and not much decor. 

There is the usual items that you can find at any all-you-can eat sushi place. There was one item that really stood out and that was the unagi sushi (bbq eel). Most places I've been to the unagi is smaller than the rice however here the unagi was massive where it  could cover the rice no problem. It was very good, and b/c of that one item alone I would go back. The only downfall was the sashmi, it was still frozen, at least some of it was. 

If you visit this place make sure you bring cash b/c you'll pay a cheaper price if you do. :-D.

Items to definetly get:
-Unagi sushi
-baby mushroom beef roll"}
{"text":"Will keep at three stars for now, but these people really need to pay for heat in their establishment if they want customers to eat in."}
{"text":"Even if I'm at the other end of the city, I would mission here because to my taste buds, this place is worth it. 

I always go for the all you can eat, my favorite items are dynamite roll, crunchy roll, spicy salmon sushi pizza and agedashi tofu. I eat a lot more than that though...

Sure, the service might suck at times, but it also depends what day and what time you go. I also don't act like I'm royalty so I don't expect the servers to kiss my ass and wait on me like I am the only one in the restaurant. That is just selfish.

I've been here around 10 times or less and I will continue going for the taste, not the service. If I want good service, I'll go to a spa. 

P.S. If you are doing AYCE, do NOT order edamame because it will be A LOT and if the majority of your group doesn't like it, then you are stuck eating a mountain of soybeans."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. It's not that good looking, it's like a family restaurant, and it's cheap. I've been there like twice, and they served me pretty well. 

I really like their misoshiro, and will come back for it. The sushi was only ok, but was like I expected for the price. I was completely alone in both times I was there, so the waitress only had eyes for me. 

Their location is great because is very close to High Park, so if you're on a lazy sunday and want to avoid those all-day fatty breakfasts, it's just across the street, beside the giant Petro-Canada. It'll be definetely healthier (but not more delicious). For those really into good japanese food, I suggest going somewhere else. For your daily bento, it's a good option and I'm in."}
