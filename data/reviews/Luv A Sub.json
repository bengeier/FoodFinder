{"text":"Update: I was back in the area again today (on my way to pick a friend up from the airport) so I stopped in and I was pleased to find out that nothing has changed. Still great food and service, and low prices. They even remembered who I was and asked how I've been, despite the fact that I haven't been a customer in over a year (I moved out of state, then back, and now I'm working across town). I still highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Located just south of the airport, right down the street from Blue Sky parking. A friend suggested I stop in before I dropped off my car at Blue Sky because the food would be made quick and would be a lot cheaper than at the airport. Plus I like to avoid greasy foods or foods that might upset my stomach before I fly, so I knew a sandwich would be a safe bet. My friend was right on both counts. (And I was right about the food not upsetting my stomach! Hah.) 

Anyways the food was tasty and I felt like I got a good bang for my buck. I checked Yelp before my visit and despite all of the comments about \"stale\" wheat bread I tried it anyways. I was pleasantly surprised as mine was not stale at all. I'm not afraid of a carb, and I eat bread everywhere I go. From my experience (as a consumer and as an occasional home baker) wheat bread isn't going to be as soft as white, but that doesn't mean it is stale. It could just mean that it was over baked, or possibly tough due to a measurement of an ingredient being slightly off. I asked where they get their bread from and I was told that a local Italian bakery delivers it early every morning. (UGH Sorry I can't remember the name, but it was very Italian-y!) Obviously local bakeries don't use the preservatives that big chains do, so that could be why the texture is off to some people .

My only gripe was actually about the parking lot. The lot itself is kind of awkward to maneuver, and there were quite a few big trucks around, so just be on your toes when you pull in. It's not always easy to see cars coming around the turns."}
{"text":"Luv A Sub is an unconventional little sub shop in the middle of an inconspicuous office park. The location can throw you off a little bit, because it really doesn't seem to belong. However, it's a good thing it's there because it's one of the few non-burger/fries joints in this particular stretch of Phoenix.

The food here is pretty decent. I've had three or four different subs here and they've all been tasty. Nothing mind-blowing, but certainly appealing to the gut. The food is pretty affordable, provided you stick with just a sub and get your drink and side elsewhere. Their menu, as has been mentioned in other reviews, is pretty extensive but unnecessarily so. They'd be better off presenting the customer with a handful of distinct sandwiches and then listing all of their toppings. They literally break out each variant of a particular sub and list it as a separate menu item, which ends up just being kind of overwhelming.

The people that work here are very friendly and the service is brisk, making this a hassle-free lunch stop for the businessperson on the go."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the review recommending to avoid the stale wheat bread before I ordered.  It was stale. Mushrooms were canned. Did not like getting hit with the $0.35 credit card fee but the prices were reasonable to start with. I had a hearty and warm and salty sandwich that will keep me going all afternoon at work. Food was delivered fast. It's an OK stop if you don't have much time for lunch."}
{"text":"Luv a Sub! Fantastic sub! I recommend #48 sub! The bread is perfectly soft and everything is fresh!! Price isn't too bad either. Give this place a shot rather than sticking to subway and the chain locations."}
{"text":"Well it's not amazing and the owner isn't the most cheerful fella, but it is fresh, fast, and a good value. I've come back dozens of times when I could easily go elsewhere so it must have something that keeps me coming."}
{"text":"I have been to luv a sub twice.  Had a hot and cold sub.  I preferred the hot.  This place is good and less expensive than most sub shops.  You can get a foot long for about $4."}
{"text":"This place makes awesome soups & chili. I also love the fact that they customize my order to what I want. The turkey sandwich is great, the salads are yummy and the service is FAST. I highly recommend Luv a Sub to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"I really really don't like this place, sure it's fast, sure it's convenient, but I'd rather spend the extra dollar or two to go somewhere else (like lunch break or even Quiznos up the road). I've been here a few times, it's close to my work and I only get 30 minutes for lunch and they are always quick, but their sandwiches are the worst I've ever had. The bread is always hard to bite into (no joke, it's like biting into a piece of jerky) and it's loaded with barely any meat. There is a guy there, might be the owner, I don't know, seems like he just hates his job and his life and he's always a bit ... Off. I wouldn't say he's rude, he's just not friendly or pleasant. I'd never recommend this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"One of my coworkers came up with the idea of paying this place a visit for lunch--and it turned out to be one of my more memorable lunches in at least the last week.  There is much that is unique about this place, enough to guarantee that you will never forget it.

The first characteristic that struck me as interesting or different was its curious location in what appears to be a typical office building.  It's not in a shopping center, or standalone building--it's in an office building.  This alone isn't enough to set it apart from other sub shops, however.

Even more curious is that distinct smell that hits you when you first walk in.  I'm not sure if it's old meat, or asbestos, or what, but the procurators of this wonderful place have come up with the brilliant idea of deviating from such typical sandwich shop smells as freshly chopped lettuce or garlic or what have you.

If they're not already different enough, they decided to make an incredibly daring move--don't put the sandwich menu up on the wall, but instead keep it to a single sheet of paper.  Why did they do this?  Possibly because the menu has somewhere on the order of 50 or 60 different choices of sandwiches--for example, the #40, \"Hot Pastrami, melted Swiss, sauerkraut, and thousand island dressing\" (which most of us simply refer to as the \"Reuben\"), and the #41, \"Hot Pastrami, melted Swiss, and thousand island dressing.\"  Yes, they felt it necessary to make each available permutation of each basic sandwich a separate menu item.  This is great because you can then make it a highly-entertaining game of finding your sandwich!  It's like an adventure in itself!

The next interesting part about a meal at Luv-A-Sub is the food itself (amazingly enough, there is nothing all that distinct about the payment process!).  I ordered the #30, \"Roast Beef, Prosciutto, Swiss Cheese, Bell Peppers, and Mushrooms.\"  My first observation when trying to pick up this sandwich is that the sandwich was incredibly hot, but the bread still managed to be decidedly non-crispy.  Interesting!  Even more crazy, however, is that the mushrooms--which certainly had the appearance of having been cooked--were still cold!  How did they do that!  Between the obviously-canned mushrooms and high-in-sodium roast beef, it certainly was a distinct sandwich, with a taste the likes of which I had never experienced up till now.

The last odd curiousity we noticed--which absolutely cements Luv-A-Sub's position as the most unique sandwich shop in the US--is the drink pricing system.  One of my coworkers--who wasn't as wise as I in getting his drink without ice, and as a result ended up getting mostly ice--decided to ask for a refill.  They were more than willing to oblige, provided he pay them $.25.  They charge for refills--fair enough--so he decided to ask for a cup of water instead.  He found that--wait for it--a cup of water costs $.25!  Amazing!  What an incredibly interesting and novel idea on their part.  Now they'll almost guarantee that they don't get repeat business!

So, if what you want is an exciting, interesting experience with an ambience unlike anything you've seen, by all means, try this place out.  But it's not for everybody--if you're one of those narrow-minded people who like a boring clean-smelling place with *typical* fresh-tasting food, it's probably not for you."}
{"text":"Excellent Sub Shop w Mom and Pop feel and food that tastes like FOOD ! Meats are fresh, never taste processed or like Chubway. :). They have a daily changing Soups which taste homemade fresh. ANY sub of theirs w Capocolla are great !! Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"So let's start with price , no where in the valley are you going to find this much sub for these prices,  you get a foot long sub for 5 to 6.50 max . You get a packed sub , full of meat , veggies whatever you want once again for 5 to 6.50 . They have over 60 options (29 is my favorite) and all prices are so low and sandwich are so good . Examples 1.sloppy joe Monday,  one of their best sibs every Monday,  I have eaten one of these at noon and felt full all day , it's heaven on buns . 2. Soups , soups are so Kendrick Lamar latest album DAMN, good . Long reference you get the point . Look they are not open all day but I recommend coming here for lunch great people , great food , great price . Literally will never go to subway nor quizno again because of this wonderful gem in Phoenix and i love how they are like in a office building,  like you have to know about this place and guest what if you found it on yelp or Google well lucky you cause it will blow you taste buds mind ."}
{"text":"This place is under-advertised and over-visited.  They're open for breakfast at 7am but they close after lunch at 2pm, so come early.  The menu us huge and the same people have been working there forever.  The food is fresh and the staff is friendly.  Service is super-fast.  When you walk in look for a laminated menu (there's not one on the wall behind the counter.)

My favorite sub is the #49 with turkey, avocado, bacon, tomato, and sprouts.

This is a perfect spot to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and fast.  I was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes even after being 4th  in line to order.  It's very clean.  

But my sandwich was just ok.  Hard to eat.  Lettuce and onions are oddly chopped together in chunks that keep falling out of the sandwich.  The wheat roll was hard and chewy.  If you are going to make a great sandwich, you need fresh bread.  It's kind of a no-brainer.  The fact that someone else pointed out the stale wheat bread in a review from 3 years ago makes it pretty clear that they don't really strive for greatness.

Also BRING CASH.  There is a 35 cent additional fee for cards."}
{"text":"I work really close so I stop in every few weeks. It's standard sub-fare but not great. Nothing special. Service is always fast and the girl who works the counter is friendly and efficient. Ifs a family run place with mom, dad, and daughter (I assume). Dad is never friendly...I usually just get a blank stare from him. 

I usually get the #48, turkey, ham, bacon. They offer white or whole wheat bread but I usually get the white even  though I'd prefer whole wheat. But I avoid it because the ww bread is always stale.

It is what it is and I'll keep going."}
{"text":"Fast forward and I've been coming here for 15 years now. It is a Ma and Pa establishment and both are super friendly as well as their daughter working the register and prepping food. The old bacon has returned and my turkey and bacon sandwiches are as good as they once were. Prices are moderate and the subs are a nice size. 

Nice quiet place to get away from office too and have a peaceful lunch."}
{"text":"I went here last week and forgot to submit my review. Its really close to my work and anything other than fast food is always a plus. It's a small place that was filled with regulars as far as I could tell... They do have many options of sandwiches... But honestly I wasn't impressed. I ordered the tuna sandwich and it was very overwhelming of onion flavor which i didn't even notice any onions in it but honestly I gave it away. Pickles are extra and they come on the side in a plastic container. My coworker ordered a sub also and he said the bread was hard and nothing special about the sandwich at all. It's close but I don't foresee me going here anymore."}
{"text":"Went here once for lunch at the suggestion of a friend from work.  he is no longer my friend.  I've got nothing, it was awful, just awful.  I love the fact that you also get hosed a nice \"fee\" for using your debit card for any purchase.  Great way to keep them coming back, nickel and dime the piss out of your customers.  The drink refill policy there is a joke.  

I'd like to give them an \"A\" for effort, but they lost me with the craptastic debit card fee and communist-style drink refill pricing, they will receive an overwhelming \"F\" rating from me.  Change that and I might give ya another shot there, Stalin."}
{"text":"I only had the pleasure of eating at this location once, but it was great!  Definitely hidden in a corner of what looks like offices and is mostly offices.  Once you get inside, it seems more old school sandwich shop with their own unique style.  Great subs!  I'd definitely go back whenever I'm in the area again."}
