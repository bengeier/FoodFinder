{"text":"At the outset Maison June Rose sounds like a good deal but it quickly falls very, very flat. The advertised all-you-can-eat $20 Chinese-style menu turned out to be a bunch of absolutely TINY appetizer sized portions that are neither tasty nor Chinese. Sure, there's things that sound familiar at a 'Chinese' restaurant - some salt and pepper shrimp, some steamed broccoli - but its evident with the first bite that no effort has gone into creating any discernable flavour. Every dish was so unbelievably salty that I had to ask for 3 refills of water. And that's saying something coming from a guy with an unfazeable stomach.  Furthermore, when my girlfriend and I tried every dish on the buffet menu we figured 'maybe the chefs actually try harder on the off-the-buffet menu.' We were mistaken. Not only did the Duck Rillettes taste like a salt lick, but it wasn't even edible. We kindly asked the waitress to take it away. After asking the owner why the dish we sent back was still on the bill (we sent it back), he vehemently refused to comp the $7 dish and said 'whatever I serve is good and people like it.' We did our best to kindly tell him the duck rillette was inexcusably bad, tasted nothing like food and only a condensed and salted preservative - and that we simply did not wish to pay for it. But the level of pomposity was too high to even have a conversation with the man. Anyway, I figured I would end the meal with one of those classic chinese desserts - sesame balls with bean paste (Another off-buffet-menu item, $5). The only way to describe it would be a frozen and microwave-reheated version of an almost un-fuck-up-able food. The preparation was so poor that the sesame ball couldn't support its own weight; in fact I was left asking \"why is it so hard to unstick from my teeth\"\" and \"what discount frozen section did they buy this from?\"  The owner SERIOUSLY needs to reconsider the buffet menu. If the buffet menu was a baseball player, it would be batting 0.154 - only the Sauteed Chinese Broccoli and the Braised Eggplant and Pork were good enough to warrant a second order. We didn't want to finish most of the buffet menu items (and we're talking VERY small sized plates). I can't tell you how heinous the duck rillette was; under no circumstances should that item be served to anyone without a severe congestion.  To be fair, the decoration and ambience is very beautiful at Maison June Rose. It would be a great bar for drinks, if you can stomach $16 cocktails (btw there's nothing special about them, only the price).  If you've had your tongue cut out recently, I'm sure you'll enjoy your dinner at June Rose!"}
{"text":"One of those place you go to have fun, a good time. The ambiance is very well tought of. Music selection is awesome - Lou reed, Van Morisson and Motown classics as I sip a White Russian ? Yes please. The \"all you can eat\" concept is swell when you are a party of four. You can taste everything, making you feel like its a little bit Christmas time. Except your eating chinese. If your waiting to be blown away ten times by the food alone you might be a tad bit disappointed, but it's still very good. Bring good friends at June Rose and everything will be right in this world for that night."}
{"text":"First of all, I must admit that I'm obviously not their target market. In fact, I'm not sure what their target market is, other than drinkers. The music is loud, supposed to be a party atmosphere, but the music is 80s and 90s. The menu has a nice restrained list of items, though there are a few as an \"upsell\". If I had to pin the tail on the donkey, this is Chinese tapas. The downside is that they serve too little on a plate. They should be plates for 2, scaled up for 3 or more, but they don't seem to scale them at all, meaning that we had to order two plates at times. The items that stand out on the menu are the barbecue pork and the eggplant. But honestly, nothing special enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"After reading a few negative reviews here and elsewhere I was hesitant to eat at June Rose but as it was a friend who chose the venue, I didn't have much of a choice. Turns out my hesitation was unfounded as my GF and I had a great time and loved the food.  The ambiance is totally charming. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. Ya perhaps  the drinks are /a little/ on the pricy side but we both enjoyed our Mai Tais and they were strong enough to leave us a little tipsy afterwards too. I don't remember the names of all the dishes we tried but we honestly really liked everything...and we're pretty discerning eaters. I do however remember the Pork and shrimp omelette, Salt and pepper shrimp, and the Braised eggplant and pork because we ordered seconds! Delicious.  Sure the servings are appetizer-sized but it's all-you-can-eat so why are people complaining about that here? If you try something you like and want more, *order it again*! And a third time if necessary. I walked out of there too stuffed for my own good. I'll try to have more restraint next time but there will certainly be a next time."}
{"text":"The place looks amazing, but the food simply is not. Just noodles right around the corner has way better food in terms of taste, portion and price. I don't mind \"fusion\" cuisine, but they got it all wrong. Go here if you want to impress someone who doesn't have a clue."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is so lovely :)  I have been praying for great tiki cocktails in Montréal for a long time. Maison June Rose certainly delivers. We left feeling quite wobbly after some Mai Tais, Singapore Slings and piña coladas in appropriate glassware. Perfect tropical escapist wintertime fantaisies for all of us trudging through the snow and sludge  I love their tasting menu, and I think it's a great deal with the early and late bird specials. There are so many delicious options. I will come back again for more braised eggplant and black vinegar mushrooms. Their egg drop soup was beautifully executed - hot, creamy and intense.  Lots of nice details  The decor is beautiful and great date spot"}
{"text":"Chic restaurant + formule culinaire simple ! Formule culinaire assez simple, on vous propose un menu buffet de mets asiatique raffinés à volonté pour seulement 25$, servi à votre table. Ce sont des petites portions à partager, que ce soit, le sauté de brocolis chinois, les côtes levées à l'ail, les aubergines & porc braisé, tous sont délicieux à mon avis. Ils ont un bar complet, cocktails, bières, vins. Superbe intérieur d'inspiration chinoise avec les lanternes et décor mais aussi design avec tables/chaises/coutellerie de style à la Big in Japan Bar. Parfait pour un rendez-vous galant, entre amis ou encore avec sa copine. J'ai adoré mon expérience, tant au niveau gastronomique qu'au niveau de l'ambiance. J'y retournerai pour sûr. Visité en avril 2015. 5/5"}
{"text":"When ones hears of All-You-Can-Eat Chinese, you tend to automatically think about dingy looking places in strip malls where everything is fried and the tables are covered in plastic. Well, the people who brought us Big in Japan last year ventured into this space with the opening of Maison June Rose just around the corner of their restaurant.  First thing, this space is just beautiful. A beautiful ornate wall welcomes you when you walk in and then your eyes focus on all the lanterns above you. And while the look is certainly old school Chinese, the sound certainly is not. A mixture of classic oldies played throughout the evening. Service was quick and attentive as well.  The format at Maison June Rose is pretty simple - 25$ per person for the All-You-Can-Eat menu. The portions are Tapas-size so pretty small but the service is quick so you can have a steady stream of dishes coming to you. Looking at the dishes, you will notice that most of the items are definitely not of the classic \"Chinese\" variety that most of us are used to and also the plating is pretty nice for what is an All-You-Can-Eat place.  We were first presented with an amuse-bouche of prosciutto with pear and pickles. A nice combo of fat, sweetness and saltiness.  The chilled Won Ton soup was an interesting idea for the season - a warm pork ravioli in a cold broth. Nicely sized and fully stuffed with pork, I loved the ravioli. The cold broth was okay. The temperature change didn't work for me.  The scrapple Imperial rolls were served with a roasted peppercorn vinegar. One of the big hits of us - a nice crunch on the rolls and good meaty goodness inside. I also really enjoyed the dipping sauce - a cool mixture of pepper and acidity that added an interesting component.   The duck rillettes is okay. Nothing that special and frankly the use of jalapeño overpowered the fatty duck. The use of a very large rice pancake also made it impossible to eat in a single bite which seemed to be the point in the first place.  The BBQ Char Siu pork was served with hoisin sauce. Thinly sliced, I enjoyed the flavour of the pork but the hoisin sauce was way too sweet to be used more than once in my case.  Our first vegetable was the Wok-fried Chinese broccoli. Perfect texture to the broccoli as the leaves were wilted while the stems stayed a bit crisp.  The mustard greens were exactly as one would expect - strong mustard like taste but cooked down enough to have a softer texture.   The braised eggplant and pork was another favourite. Nice soft but slightly firm texture to the eggplant although the pork here was only crumbs in the sauce which was not what we expected when it arrived. Larger portions of pork would have been nice.  The salt and pepper tofu was a real surprise. I hate tofu. My girlfriend as well. Neither one of us could believe how this preparation gave the tofu a nice crispy exterior while the interior was soft but not the mushy kind we both despise. Served on some wilted fried spinach, the surprise hit of the night.  The salt and pepper smelts were essentially the same preparation as the tofu but with fish. That gave this dish more saltiness and fattiness than the tofu.  The Kung Pao chicken had strong flavour although a touch too sweet perhaps. The fried texture was perfect as well although the fact that they were small bones to contend with, while having been warned by the waitress in advance, may this less enjoyable to deal.  Black vinegar cloud ear mushrooms were very vinegar in flavour which I enjoyed however texture wise, the addition of the egg folk made this dish almost gelatinous which wasn't as much of a hit.  The Singapore curry rice noodles were exactly what you expected and wanted. Noodles were perfect, the mixture of onions, celery and scallions worked well and the scrambled egg put it all together.  Orange Beef served with a caramelized orange was a slightly disappointment. Very thinly sliced cold beef was good but I didn't get the orange flavour I expected.  Shepherd's pie with sweet and sour sauce. This was awesome. The use of a sweet and sour sauce really made this an Asian play on a classic Quebecois dish.   Roasted salmon head was something I never would have ordered if it wasn't for the fact this was All-You-Can-Eat. Some good fatty meat to grab hold of there but definitely not a favorite.  At the end, we then treated to the combination of fortune cookies and oranges where the pulp had been pureed and placed back on the rind. A cool approach that worked pretty well.  After all of that, I am ambivalent about June Rose. Love the look and feel of the space so much. However, when it comes to the dishes themselves, there were only a couple of items that were true hits to me. The vast majority were good but not enough to make me really want to order them again. And there in lies my issue. I enjoyed Maison June Rose enough to know I could have a good meal there but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to visit again.  Cheers!"}
