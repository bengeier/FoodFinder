{"text":"My experience at Swigs wasn't so great, but I will give it one more chance. 
We pulled up to Swigs to have a drink or two after going out for a date. The parking lot was pretty full but we managed to get a spot. There was a crowd of people smoking outside the front door, which I guess is to be expected at a pub. 
We entered the bar and there was a live band playing and it was LOUD!!! 
There weren't any tables available to sit so we just left again... We were just looking for a low key place to have a couple drinks before calling it a night and we weren't expecting what we encountered. 
Now this could have been a special event for all we know and maybe it isn't usually so loud in there. I will give swigs one more chance before I write them off completely."}
{"text":"Chicken wings!. Went this past wing night for wings! They are so good!
Some of the best in Calgary!
Really hard to find and hard to get too but worth it for the wings!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few too many times.  I wish I never had but unfortunately a friend of mine dragged me here on more than one occasion.  This place smells bad and the food is worse than the smell.  The place looks as though they never clean or maybe just haven't changed anything for 20 years and like the place looking like a ball of death.  The waitresses seem like they can't get any other job so might as well work here and treat people the same way.  It's a small place and yes sometimes has live music that is way to much for such a small place!  If I could give a 0 review I would or maybe even a -5.  This place is filled with drunken locals and will make you feel like that smushed fry on the floor that the waitress dropped as she was bending over to get a better tip.  Avoid avoid avoid be warned!"}
{"text":"Tuesday was the second time I've been here for wings.

The wings are decently-sized and there is a huge selection of flavours to choose from. I found that some of the dry flavours tasted a lot like chicken wings with popcorn seasoning, but take that how you will. I personally like the sauce-flavoured wings best anyway (sweet chili, teriyaki, honey garlic). 

It gets pretty busy on wing night, but last Tuesday there were only two servers to the whole bar. On our table of 7, we got two servers (maybe because we were in the middle of the bar?), yet our wings and drinks still took a considerable amount of time. Inevitably, they also screwed up our bill (they left off some items). Good news is they gave us the missing items on the bill for free (maybe because we were honest and since it was their mistake). 

All in all, it's one of the more decent places in the city to get wings. Not sure though if it warrants the #1/#2 rank it got on Hotwings."}
{"text":"Went for wings tonight and as always its packed(always a great thing). Sadly the wings were no where near where they should be. Not fully cooked, still bloody, not enough sauce. Just really sloppy. It was a different cook too.  Next time I'll choose to have wings  by who the cook is.As well the services was at its slowest too. None the less I still tipped even if I didn't want too! Sorry Swigs.... I need a break for awhile :("}
{"text":"Nothing notable about this place whatsoever except that it is extremely far from pretty much everything.

If you live in the area and want a stagger-distance unremarkable common bar then this is the joint for you.

Prices, service, and food are average."}
