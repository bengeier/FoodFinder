{"text":"If you enjoy a good chicken shwarma then you gotta try Yummi's.
Its not your typical shwarma. First they can't roll the pita because they stuff tons of ingredients into the pita, so it kinda looks like an empanada on steroids.  I also like that they cut the chicken fresh off the grill when you order, many places carve the chicken earlier and leave it to dry out.
The real magic is in the garlic sauce. And If I'm correct the secret ingredient is Dill.  The combination of garlic and dill (although it will reek havoc on your breath) is just amazing and separates this pita from others.

If your near Yonge and Bloor, do try it.
Oh, and its cheap.  $499 with a pop.
can't beat that"}
{"text":"Well, the price was right.

It's really hard to find a bad shawarma sandwich.  And this one wasn't bad.  Just mediocre.  At five bucks with a can of pop, I'd call it good value.

I stopped into Yummi's after leaving work later than I care to, and realized that I had no easy meal option waiting at home (Must...Find...Stay-at-home wife...)  I arrived around 9 to a friendly welcome from a young lady who, it turns out, was on her first day.  It's always so funny to watch someone on their first day at a job; everything they do seems awkward and over-considered.  It provided some entertainment as my sandwich was prepared, especially when she screwed up my change (and, I note, politely corrected the matter when I pointed it out).

Maybe it's Done That Way for a Reason:

I'm not one for sticking to tradition for the sake of sticking to tradition, but sometimes things are done a certain way for a reason.  Take the rolled pita sandwich, for example (where a large pita is half-filled and then rolled over on itself).  This standard format has lasted through the years because it makes for easy consumption while on the go, even while walking home really, really drunk (yes, I'm talking about you!).  Flaunting flatbread functionality and pooh-poohing pita practicalities, Yummi's has instead elected to embrace the stuffed-pouch method, whereby a smaller pita is forced so full of chicken and toppings until it looks like Pacman on a salad diet.  The pita is then placed opening-facing-up in a deep paper bag, rendering it inaccessible to the human mouth without a bag-tearing intervention from the hand.  Maybe if I were an aardvark...

Yummi's second deviation from shawarma best practices was in their adoption of tzatziki as a substitute for tahini.  Don't get me wrong - I LOVE tzatziki sauce.  But it doesn't belong on a shawarma.  In fairness, the tzatziki was delicious (even if it probably came from a Costco tub)."}

But then my friend and i watched raw meat and falafel being manhandled by the same gloves. So yeah, Yummi's is good if you don't mind a little raw beef with your falafel!"}
