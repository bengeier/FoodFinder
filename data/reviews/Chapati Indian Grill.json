{"text":"Great food but I've gone 3 times in the past few weeks and they never have anything in stock. I tried to go yesterday but there was no rice left (white or brown), no chicken, and only 1 person working both food line and register. I'm going to give them another chance because I love the food but it's a bit ridiculous to never have any to serve."}
{"text":"Eat here at least once a week. Great value for fresh original spin on Indian fast casual food. Yes, they took the Chipotle style of service, cause it works. A must part of your lunch and dinner choices. Vegan options as well."}
{"text":"Food was cold, bland, and unimpressive. Portion size was small for price. This place has a lot of potential, but isn't up to par wiith other Indian restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Beef was so chewy that I had to chew over 50 times to break down some of the pieces. Got a bowl: Flavors dont go together too well, rice on the bottom gets soggy, and overall not a meal where you look forward to eating the next bite. Honestly not a fan when it comes to quality, but il ll give it 2 stars since the bowl was only 3.50."}
{"text":"Average food. Its a ripoff of chipotle, which is ok- but it fails at it sooo hard. The to-go containers are awful and dont stay closed. The food seems bland and drowned in sauce and sugar. Its overall, just crappy americanized indian food thats barely indian."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the guy who helped me was so nice! He walked me through the whole thing (thank goodness!) Food was yummy too!"}
{"text":"Better than I expected after my ordering experience. I ordered a bowl with tofu, rice, chickpeas, red beans, tomatoes, and cucumbers. My frustration came when none of the employees knew what items were vegan or what vegan even means. Some of the vegan items are marked on the overhead menu but the sauces were not. I'm the type of person that needs sauce on everything I eat and since I'm not willing to gamble with ingredients I had to go without. They did not have any of the chutneys advertised either which is disappointing. The food was decent but I wouldn't rush back, I'll take the extra drive to Choolah for now."}
{"text":"I use to like this place when they first opened. But my resent experience is what got them this review. They use to be fast and friendly now is a whole other story.
I went there for a quick lunch since I haven't eating all day and it was 12:30 I was desperately hungry I was kept waiting while the attendant took all the time in the world, I waited 15 minutes before she even started asking for my order she answered the phone and all the she started taking my order and another person came behind me she started attending to the woman before she was even done with my order no problem I am cool with that she is multi-tasking. Then after she had dished the food I close the check out the guy the said who is paying with cash and who is paying with card. I was paying with card? I mean who carries cash anymore? The he said \"sorry our machine is not working\" really! So 25 minutes of standing here was a waste are you kidding me my lunch break was over just standing here I walked out and trust me I almost cried cause I was so hungry, and due to my anger I just walked to work and downloaded yelp. Please chapati respect people's time."}
{"text":"The food was very well seasoned and yummy! The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. Eat here!"}
{"text":"The food basically taste like one of those microwavable indian dishes that you can buy at any indian grocery store for like a third of the price. Also the employees are straight up rude and if you ask them a question about the food they look at you like you asked them for one of their kidneys. Its a shame cause this thing has a ton of potential and could be a huge success."}
{"text":"I was out running an errand to Fed-Ex when I came across the Chapati Indian Grill.Upon walking in the restaurant the decor was inviting,and the employees were very friendly.The manager on the other hand was very rude and kept interrupting the employee that was explaining the menu to me.The employee had to explain the menu because it came off as very confusing,and lacked description of what exactly I was ordering.I then ordered Chapatti to go with my meal.For those of you that are unfamiliar with what a Chapati is...It's an Indian flat bread(very tasty) what I received instead was a sham of a Chapati that was actually a tortilla made for burritos.I called the store to complain since I took my order to go,but the store manager was not in.I will look for an authentic Indian food experience at a another restaurant."}
{"text":"The toppings are decent but they use tortilla wraps which makes me think this is simply an Indian version of Chipotle.  Would have liked real chapati bread."}
{"text":"I'm really digging this spot. Stumbled across it looking for a quick lunch one day...food was good--I mean fresh and tasty good. In case it may have been a fluke, I reserved judgment but no, they are good. 

As far as the criticisms, that hasn't been my experience. They were out of tamarind sauce at 8:30 PM and mixed up a batch because I was cool with waiting. Even so, this is clearly a small business and working out the kinks comes with territory. I'm rocking with them for the time being. 

I'm keeping them in my rotation."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and was very impressed. Prices similar to Chipotle. Beautiful decorating inside, fast service, friendly staff. The food was well prepared as well. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Today we ordered Chapati for a group of 6 people, each person ordering their own customized \"bowl.\"  Initially we had difficulty even getting the employees to answer the phone and we actually talked to them over 9 times to coordinate getting the meal and faxed them an order sheet.  We were hoping that the trouble would be worth it and unfortunately it was not.  Not only were our meals incorrect and missing ingredients, but the portion sizes were extremely small.  Several of the bowels were less that 1/4th full and since they were missing so many ingredients we were left annoyed and hungry.  We certainly don't plan upon ordering again."}
{"text":"Does anybody even work here? One couldn't even get delivery let alone inside service. Such a shame, this new chain had a lot of potential at one point."}
{"text":"Chipotle wanna-be!  Literally copied the concept. You start with rice (white or brown), in a bowl or wrap, choose from two kinds of beans (chick peas, kidney beans), add protein (chix, beef, tofu, potatoes), add curries (tomato, onion, coconut), add toppings (pickled onions, tomato cucumber salad, cilantro, hot vinegar) then add sauce (tamarind, cilantro-mint, yogurt) and finally topping of onion fritter or papad.  

It was just mediocre. The three \"different\" curries all pretty much had same flavors. 
The whole chipotle concept just does not work for Indian food. At least not for me. It was a giant bowl of mush.
The cilantro chutney was frozen and thawed. How can you not serve fresh chutney?
The \"chapati\" - the namesake of the restaurant is a tortilla.  C'mon ....seriously? Its like Joes Texas BBQ serving frozen chicken nuggets!!  If you name your restaurant Chapati then the least u can do is serve real fresh made chapati.  Hopefully they are working on this.
Staff was totally un-trained. The kids working there could not answer any questions. 
Price is not bad.....chipotle.... Remember.  All main entrees are $6.65 to $6.95.
The good thing they have going is the location. On campus of Cleveland state university. So there will be no shortage of customers wanting a giant bowl of food for $7. Especially the Indian students!!"}
{"text":"It's okay. I concur with the Chipotle comparison, but I didn't find it close to authentically Indian. It was somewhat bland, the spices are not steeped in and immersed into the food as Indian should be, and the aroma of the food is nowhere close to authentic.

The staff is nice and helpful though, and they have a nice patio, and the Ice cream place across from it is totally awesome. Otherwise I'd try Chipotle.. Chipotle is tastier than this knock off."}
{"text":"Wonderful!!  Fast, affordable, yummy!  Check them out!!  I have eaten here 3 times.  It's kinda like Chipolata in that you pick bowl or wrap, then you pick a rice, then, meat, then they have these 4 amazing sauces!!! Omg! They are awesome!!!  At then end of the assembly line you pick cucumbers, tomato's, cilantro and then flavorful toppings!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised here! I like the concept and the food is quite good!! I am usually a vindaloo fan, so only real improvement could be a bit spicier sauce option. 

The staff was quite knowledgeable and pleasant as well which is always nice being you don't get that everywhere no a days! 

Would recommend to anyone liking Indian food to give it a shot. I'll definitely be back and probably quite often."}
{"text":"Chapati has a ton of potential, the idea of an Indian style chipotle is genius. The options, flavor and food quality leave a lot to be desired. The channa masala was bland as was all of the toppings that I chose for my bowl. I would like to say I would try Chapati again in hopes of a better experience but the drive across town is not worth my time for sub par Indian food."}
{"text":"I love Indian food. My husband and I have wanted to try this place out for a while now and finally were in the area. This street is full of great and awesome places. I think in order for this place to survive in such an environment, they would need to spice it up somehow. I mean literally. The flavoring was a bit bland. I understand a lot of us, Americans, do not like spice but authenticity needs to be there.  Set up is good. And service was great. Bring it on!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having Indian food so i didn't know what to expect. I went a few minutes before they closed and got the Butter Chicken . The portion was quite generous and everyone was super friendly. All I can say is Delicious"}
{"text":"Reading a lot of these reviews, this place seems to get a bad rap, mostly stemming from bad customer service experiences. Not that this isn't extremely important, but I'm going to therefore base this review mostly on the food (my customer experience was great btw). 

I ordered a bowl with the paneer and added a scoop of the tofu for just 50¢. The portions were beyond generous and the paneer and tofu were juicy and flavorful. The sauces (tomato and yogurt) had just the right amount of sweetness and spice. Followed up with a mango peach lassi, it was a satisfying dinner. I'm not quite bumping up the review into 4.5 territory because the rice was a bit dry. Service was good, but took a bit to come out and greet us. Give this place another chance!"}
{"text":"Chepati food made me feel so terrible that I had to post a review.. I had the vegetarian cheese cubes, and then filled in the rest of my bowl with veggies and the spicy tomato sauce. The bold flavor you typically get from great Indian food wasn't there, so it certainly didn't make up for the stomach pain I endured after."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! And now I'm obsessed!
And they take Casecash!!!

Like the comparisons to chipotle, this place may not be the most authentic place to get Indian food. But the food definitely is tasty and the workers here are so dang nice.

When my friend and I walked in, the worker made fresh new white rice for us. They thoroughly explained all my questions and was not annoyed.

This place definitely replaces chipotle in my book. The food and workers are way better.
10/10 I recommend."}
{"text":"I work around the corner from this place, so got some carryout for lunch today.  I love Indian food, have no problem with the \"fast casual\" Chipotle concept, so I was hopeful this would be good.

I tried to keep my expectations in check.  The place is a sidewalk storefront in the bottom floor of student/professor housing, so I didn't expect it to be 5 start - but was definitely hoping for at least average.

I really, really want to give this place 3 stars, but it just isn't that good.  

The menu was pretty limited.  Again, I get the fast casual concept, and the proteins were fine - just there wasn't much to go with it.  A handful of sides, mostly fried, but that's where the money is I suppose.  Chickpeas looked like they came out of a can and my \"protein\" - the potatoes - were pretty lackluster.  If there's one thing I love about Indian food, it's the explosion of flavors and all just basically fell flat.

As mentioned, even the curry toppings weren't that great.  They have three (onion/tomato/coconut).  I got 1/2 coconut and 1/2 tomato (for an extra charge), and neither had much taste either.  They were both pretty thick as well, with a consistency kind of like thick pasta sauce, so overall my bowl came off as very dry to boot.

So, much as I love Indian food, and this place is literally around the corner from me, based on taste I doubt I'll be back. I don't hate the concept - it just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Overall the food is good. While there are lots of options and combinations, the people working there were very helpful in guiding us on what to mix with what. I'd go back."}
{"text":"The Chipotle for Indian food! I can't say I've had enough Indian food to compare the quality or authenticity of it all. But, for the price of the food, I definitely was satisfied and had extra to bring home. I got the bowl with chicken and paired it with the coconut curry at the recommendation of the employee. So glad that I asked what would be good with the chicken, or else I may have had different opinions of the place. They have the veggies section, where you can add a number of veggies as you do in Chipotle. If you don't like spicy, DO NOT GET THE THAI CHILIS. My spicy tolerance level is quite high and even that was pushing it.  I love it because it adds the perfect touch of spice for me. I wouldn't recommend eating the chili pieces, if you can avoid them. They do not play.

If you haven't tried Chapati and are looking for a quick bit to eat, this is a place to at least try! It's conveniently located in Uptown, which means finding street parking, or parking behind the Barnes and Noble and walking across the street."}
{"text":"They serve what they call \"vegan\" food knowing that it isn't. Ethics aside, some people have allergies or are lactose intolerant. It is very dangerous to feed people foods that are different from what you said you are serving. I don't feel comfortable eating from an establishment that lies about what is in their food."}
{"text":"Very very slow service ! Long waiting in line. Service is very disorganized! Although food is pretty decent.
It's the Indian version of chipotle"}
{"text":"Awful!  Rice was hard and dry. Their food bins were almost all empty - all so unappetizing looking. The staff didn't know much about what the different options were. And - it was just average tasting. With so many great options nearby, I have no idea why anyone would go. For awesome Indian, I'd walk a bit further to Indian Flame."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but it's going south. Only one woman working the counter and it took her over 15 minutes to roll two burritos. She spent a few of those first minutes take a phone call. Began making my burritos without putting on her gloves, touching my food with her bare hands. Then her portions were all over the place (huge ladles of sauce, and not enough rice/protein), and the way she was spooning stuff onto the shell made it look like she's never handled a ladle before.. And one of my burritos was such a hot mess at the end with the toppings squirting out the ends of the burrito everywhere. She literally couldn't roll a burrito. It was so messy that I had to ask for a bowl at the end. The lid on the bowl wasn't properly secured so it popped off in the bag and my burrito went everywhere. Then she forgot to include a fork (i took the meal to-go), so now I'm at a loss how to eat this mess of a thing since I'm not somewhere with forks on hand. Chapati - TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES. There is no reason this should have ever been an issue. I knew I should have went to Bombay Chaat."}
{"text":"I ordered a special through UberEats. What I got was okay, but I was missing 2 items out of 3. The bag was stapled shut, so I don't think it was the driver's fault. No one contacted me to make this right. The food is okay for Chipotle style Indian., not great and not terrible, either."}
{"text":"A friend and I went for a lunch.  We were surprised to learn about the $2 offer on Tuesday so we decided to sit down. We have been here many times and usually enjoy the food.  Since my friend did not know much about Indian food, I decided to take a bowl for her.  The manager was rude and made disgusting comments about how the friend can come for herself and order food. She proceeded to tell her staff not to put give extra serving if I request (which shocked me as to why I would?).  We left feeling humiliated for no reason.  Never returning again."}
{"text":"10% off with a CSU student ID! It's chipotle for Indian food. You can get a roll or a bowl, pick a protein (chicken, tofu, etc), white or brown rice, and add toppings and sauces. I had a tofu bowl (the server made fresh tofu for me) with brown rice, chickpeas, tomato sauce, cucumber salad (recommended), veggies, and a spicy cilantro chutney (recommended). The portions are huge and it was only $7. It's great on a cold night, it's pretty spicy and warmed me up! The mango lassi was sweet and thick, it went well with the spicy food. Street parking outside was easy for me and the service was friendly, slower because they made fresh ingredients for me but I'm glad they did."}
{"text":"Whoever said this was the chipotle of Indian food is right with one exception; it's not nearly as good.

I had a bowl with tofu and brown rice and assorted vegetables. I guess the thing that struck me about my experience is that the bowls are an appropriate size but there just isn't enough variety of the items in a bowl. The bowl is dominated by rice and meat, and there just wasn't much else. The food that was in the bowl was delicious, but the meal just felt empty for me.

We got take out, so I can't speak too much to the atmosphere, but it seemed pleasant. The service area is a bit grungy but I didn't gag on any bad smells; it was all acceptable. It just wasn't amazing. If you want fast food that is vaguely Indian, this is a totally acceptable place to go. If you want Indian food, this is unlikely to be your favorite place, and you would probably be better off eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is not good indian food guys, don't go here theres much better options in cleveland"}
{"text":"Similar to Indian chipotle. I am not a big fan of Indian food but they let me try samples of anything I wanted and I found a great combination that worked for me. Have been there additional times after my first visit."}
{"text":"Never have been. Decided I'd come from the Clinic down Euclid and give it a shot with a coworker. I love all sorts of cuisine. 

Walk in. Presentation of the bar awful. Minute or so later finally greeted. Proteins and what not looked as if they were microwaved from perhaps last night. I made it clear id never been. Just wanted a little run down of what these indistinguishable items were. The guy really couldn't give me much insight. Kept calling me young man. When he was probably my age. They had cleaning chemicals out around food. My buddy took a pic of that and is sending that in so keep a look out for that. 

Food tastes pretty good. However with awful first opinions and customer service like that I fear for the longevity of the business. 

Regards."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend. Ordered a bowl. The first thing that shocked me was the price. How can I get lower quality food, less food, but for a higher price than Chipotle? 

I was dissatisfied with the experience. No wonder they were empty."}
{"text":"Another great fast-casual option! Chapati is set up is what is now known as \"Chipotle style.\" Wait in line, order a bowl or roti (wrap) and pick your rice, protein, bean or chickpeas, curry sauce, and assorted toppings. The portions are large, prices are low, and flavors balanced. I've enjoyed a samosa with spicy cilantro sauce for a quick snack, it's only $1.45 and quite large, and the bowl with chicken, coconut curry, and several of the toppings. I love how you can customize if you like more spice with your food. I've even split a bowl with my husband when less hungry, and for about $8 with tip, that's a steal! The service has thus far been excellent too."}
{"text":"I love indian food. I would say I have so much of it that my blood probably has a curry smell to it. I came here with the expectation of great indian food, well at least averagely good. I was a little bit disappointed. While the food itself is mostly authentic the flavors were not. It is as if they are afraid of their own flavors. The chicken and beef I tried were marinated but lacked any sort of punch like curry or any decent garam masala would give it. Flavors all felt watered down to accommodate weaker palates. It loses its authenticity and flavor along the way. Not a good thing btw. The one thing that helped bring the flavor back into my bowl was an extra side of their spicy cilantro sauce which is quite spicy for those who can't handle spice. They need to step up their flavor if they want to compete with all the great food options nearby. Load up on the curry, cumin, garam masala and turmeric. Seriously. Bring it on. Don't dumb it down for us \"Americans\" make us meet you at your level."}
{"text":"This comment is probably redundant, but Indian food in a Chipotle model. I tried a bowl and you can come up with some pretty interesting flavor combinations. The food, I like.

What I don't like is the presentation. The service was rude. The soda machine was broken (ice dispenser).  There were no lids for the cups in the self service trays. 

I would come back, but I get the same reception it would probably be my last. There are too many other good alternatives within walking distance."}
{"text":"This is only my second time consuming Indian cuisine. I do believe because of my experience that I am an expert on the bold flavors that the cuisine of India brings to the table. For my lunch I ordered beef, white rice, cilantro, tomato sauce, tomatoes, and a sweet masala sauce. I also ordered a Masala Chai, which I received after I was nearly done with my food. (Just thought it was worth mentioning but it does not correlate to the quality of service and food at Chapati) The server was very pleasant and made sure to explain the intricate flavors and how the process worked. She did mention the similarity to Chipotle. It is never good to mention rival businesses. The flavors brought me back to my childhood wonder of exploring new flavors as being slightly frightened by new and exciting spices. The spice the the beef held within its being was so bold and flavorful whilst still remaining true to the classic Indian flavor. I will say that when I did receive my Masala Chai that I was underwhelmed. The flavor was that of a plain old vanilla chai with a hint of cinnamon. The flavor was dampened by the water quite a lot. Maybe the flavor would improve if hot milk was used instead.
Overall I am very impressed with the quality of service and quality of food. I would highly recommend a quick lunch here but it is not the highest representation of the vast and impeccable Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my bowl. I got brown rice, chicken, the spicy curry sauce, cilantro, and lettuce. Fairly simple but so good. I'm looking forward to coming back and ordering it again! 

Update: beware of what time you come in. Later in the evening, food can sometimes look and taste dry/old."}
{"text":"The woman who working that is so rude and they charge me $2 extra for no reason! The food is not good. Never go back again!"}
{"text":"I went to this store for lunch at 3 p.m. last Thursday. This was my first time and will be the last time either. It was so empty even no employees. I waited for a while until a lady ask what I like. Then I paid for my lunch $7.51 on my credit and I got a cup of water. Unfortunately, the water tasted bitter which tasted like sparkling water, maybe it was, and I don't like it. I could not get the regular water so I got 1/3 water cup of ginger ale which I don't want to drink either, because I don't drink pop or any beverage with sugar. And the lady talked to me so loud \"if you want pop you should pay\" . I turn around and see some bottle water. I answered \" I don't want pop, I want water but since you don't have regular water I want a bottle water.\" And I paid $1 for the water in cash. Today when I was paying my credit card I saw the charge from chapati is $9.51!!! Why? The food is not good compare to Bombay chaat, the employee is very rude. I will never ever go there anymore."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero if I could. The lady who served us was the most rude manager I have known. while we got there a little after 9:35 pm to get dinner, they being open until 10 PM.  The lady had the audacity to tell us we had 6 minutes to finish our food and leave. The rice was grossly undercooked- when I complained about this she said she hasnt heard about this from others. I requested extra sauce a little later since our food was dry. She refused to give this to me saying we should have asked earlier while buying the food,  although I was willing to pay for the damned sauce. To my horror , she then threw the left over curry sauce in the trash, while she could provide a bit of it to a customer who just tipped her well for no reason, shows her mindset and lack of basic manners. TERRIBLE SERVICE, STALE UNDERCOOKED FOOD. Avoid coming here if you don't want to fall sick"}
{"text":"I was here with co workers needed something quick and its close to my job, the food was ok nothing special but the quantity sucked we had to order some samosa to full fill our hunger I would definitely recommend going to chipotle because you get more food and quality is better unless the owner decides to upgrade the quality and the quantity or drop the price I will not be going here again unless it's a rainy day!!"}
{"text":"Great concept, cold food and bad service. Too many other delicious options in this neighborhood to give this another shot."}
{"text":"I've been here a good handful of times now and have had mixed experiences. I typically get a bowl with the paneer and tomato sauce. The food exhibits good flavor and spice (cilantro chutney). It seems they have issues with heating their food to serving temperature. Last night, my bowl was cold and I asked if they had a microwave (they don't)."}
{"text":"I'm here in Cleveland for a brief time to help.my sister set up for grad school, and my Indian family and I came here for a fast casual meal with familiar flavors. We found exactly what we wanted!! The service was extremely friendly, and very attentive. The prices were very reasonable and I loved the wrap I got. The options were plentiful with a myriad of options to choose from. I won't be here for long but I will definitely be going back! Disappointed that Yelp misled me about this place, but ultimately happy I went."}
{"text":"They get a zero. They were at Vegfest in Cleveland over the weekend and told Vegans the food did not have dairy or cheese when it did. This is dangerous because many people that have a vegan diet have diary allergies."}
{"text":"Food is good! But the servers are stingy, and everything is extra. It is not authentic indian food and i would like to see more options perhaps paneer. But overall decent stop."}
{"text":"The food is what you would expect for the price, and the employees are friendly. However, most of the options for food didn't have descriptions and I didn't know what I was ordering. Music was loud and I had issues communicating with the employees."}
{"text":"The look of the place is nice and I was expecting the food to be good, but nothing was fresh or flavorful.

A lot of the hot ingredients were lukewarm to cold, and nothing was memorable or special. Usually Indian food is full of spices and flavors, but everything tasted watered down and bland.

Nice location, look, and it was cheap, but not worth returning."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks very professional and clean.
It looks as part of a chain. I guess the owner is dreaming to have a chain like Chippotle with Indian food, but the taste of their food has nothing to do with authentic Indian food. 
They have chicken that was cooked separately with almost no spices. When they add the tomato based curry sauce on top of that chicken, they call it butter chicken. I will call it 'The most fake version of butter chicken with no taste'. 
Also, they will give a 7 inch wide paper bowl with layer of rice at the bottom, then put some chicken on it and their tasteless curry sauce, plus some toppings !!! on top of butter chicken. You get everything mixed in a bowl. Their prices are higher than what the offer in the bowl.

I paid almost $9 for a bowl of rice with some chicken and some tomato lettuce etc.
I can have a Indian buffet for $10 that is full with authentic Indian flavors and lots of food choices. 

I am not going back."}
{"text":"This place has decent food, at best. And ironically, a good Western ambience. However, having a lot of experience with Indian cuisine, I would say that the food here is not that great or even close to what I expect from Indian cuisine. I decided to check it out during lunch time one day, and ordered a rice bowl with the chick peas, chicken and tomato sauce. I also ordered a chai (milk tea) and samosa. Again, the food was nothing special and didn't taste anything like \"chana masala\" and \"chicken tikka.\" The samosa was hard and almost inedible, and the chai was cold. I went to ask for it to be reheated and have never dealt with such inexperienced and (critical thinking skills-lacking) workers in my life! They all looked at me dumbfounded and one said \"but I just made a new batch.\" I told him that the chai was cold out of the dispenser. After waiting a long time for something to be done, I asked for a refund. Again, no one knew what to do and just blankly stared at each other. Finally, I asked to switch drinks and that was successfully done. I wasted a good 20 minutes and the rest of my food was cold by then, too. But I didn't bother asking for it to be heated up. 

The concept is cool but don't come here seeking tasty food."}
{"text":"This place was actually pretty good. I had great service while I was there and was shocked when I read the poor reviews on Yelp afterwards. I recommend this place to eat quick Indian food. I was a little skeptical at first, but the guy behind the counter made suggestions about what to eat.
I ordered a bowl with chickpeas, chicken, potatoes, red curry sauce and yogurt. The bowl was big enough for 2 people to eat. I wouldn't have been able to finish the bowl on my own. I am going back soon."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good. I would frequent about 3-4 times a week bc it was so good. Over the last 6 months they have hired in management that is more than incompetent. They constantly don't have ingredients made and are unwilling to make them upon request. They've cut their portion sizes in half including all of the sides. I haven't had a warm meal there in probably at least 4 months. It's always like warm and mushy and just feels gross in your mouth. Everything they have on their board for you to order from is wrong and typically doesn't display the correct prices either. I'm not even cashing in my 200 belly points for two free bowls bc I don't want to eat there again, it's gotten that bad. I had to wait over 35 minutes for them to fry 1 veggie cutlet even though the board says two and I was charged for 2 and told that they were sorry about my luck. Don't go here. Find an authentic Indian place because this is terrible.  I've also tried to reach out to the management personally with no response at all to my issues."}
{"text":"It's Indian food served chipotle style. Not nearly as good as chipotle, even though the chipotle down the street is not the best chipotle. Not as flavorful as I would've liked, especially considering since Indian food is usually very flavorful. Much rather go to Indian flame which is also a block or away."}
{"text":"This place is actually a good idea..and tastes good enough for what it is, but it just seems like the workers don't care. Like other reviewers have stated..the wait time can be ridiculous. I think 2 people were ahead of me and I swear I stood in that place for 15 minutes. No sense of urgency...but at least they were nice. -__- Not a good idea to be slow in a college area."}
{"text":"I am very alarmed after reading an apology written by The Cleveland VegFest in regards to Chapati serving non vegan food at the VegFest event.  This is very disappointing and frustrating as a person with food allergies.  I'm glad that I did not choose to eat at Chapati's vendor booth and instead ate delicious food from Townhall and Cleveland Vegan."}
{"text":"I went here on a busy weekday for lunch and was appalled by the service. I was second in line and it took me more than 25 minutes to order some food. It was disappointing that the staff made no effort to keep the line moving even with more than 10 people waiting. I just went for what's available and had a rice bowl with paneer and yogurt and it was mediocre at best. 

I'd probably never go back."}
{"text":"OMG finally an Indian food Fast food style!  Go for quick snacks with Garama Garam chai!  Tea with Samosa @ 3:00 pm in cleveland !  Can't beat it. Close to CSU wish they have chain of this Indian version of chipotle across U.S."}

{"text":"My review isn't based on authenticity of Indian cuisine, but rather as a fast food restaurant that is a bit out of the ordinary lunchtime fare. My first impression was also a bit Chipotle-inspired, after all, one could have their food served in a bowl or with a wrap. I found the food to be inexpensive, flavorful, and healthy--certainly a lot less salty than its southwest cousin a few doors down. I've been here twice now and both times I have been greeted and served with a smile and pleasant people. Again, I can't speak to the authenticity of the Indian-style food, but it was an overall satisfying dining experience as a quick-serve joint that is perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"No wonder this place is empty at lunchtime. 
They did not care when their key ingredients were running low. 
When I got there, they didn't have chicken or beef. All they had were tofu and potato, but no one seemed to be cooking in the kitchen. Ingredients looked pretty gross as if they were sitting there for days.."}
{"text":"Our rice and chickpea bowls were delicious. But we won't be returning. The place seemed poorly managed. The counter service was scatterbrained, and the guy who took our order and served our food was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that he was handling customers' money. The place was nearly empty on a Saturday at lunchtime. Something tells me they won't be around much longer, especially with the overabundance of fast food and fast casual options in the Uptown district."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Fast, healthy and good portions. Enough for two meals.  Can't wait to go back!  Staff was really nice too."}
