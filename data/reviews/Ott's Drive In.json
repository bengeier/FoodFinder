{"text":"This is an excellent old school greasy spoon. Interior probably hasn't changed since 1950. The food is good the service is good the atmosphere is pleasant. Would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"My weekly habit. I have to get Otts on Saturday for lunch, brunch.  Been going there since the 60's when my dad would take us."}
{"text":"I used to have breakfast and lunch there several times a week in the winters of '82 and '87, when there as a student at Chanute.  The thing I loved going back for was the grilled cheese and bowl of chili.  When the weather was at its worst, white-out and below zero, that's what warmed me up for an afternoon in class.  I gotta get back up there this winter when I make the next run to Chicago for a couple cases of Genny."}
{"text":"Small town dinner with a simple menu. Fast food with a friendly face that seems to be extremely popular with locals! I tried pancakes and eggs... Very good and classically American. Our server was sweet and helpful. I'm glad we went.   It's not a fancy place, so I didn't have high hopes. But man, the water was nasty. It tasted like dirt and metal. Bring your own water! Other than that... Not a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Worth the extra drive to find. Everything cooked to order and very reasonable. Parking is tight and service rather indifferent though we didn't go without anything. If were that way again we'll stop by again."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've tried Ott's since they reopened. The food was really good and the staff very friendly. The booths are a bit small and my fiance and I were a little cramped when we shared a side while my friend and her daughter shared the other.  The menu is straight forward and the atmosphere is casual. I grew up around the area so I got to see several familiar faces including some staff members I hadn't seen in years."}
{"text":"This is a great little diner with a small town feel. They have a good breakfast menu but I decided to get lunch and go with their  1/2 pound Ott burger. It was freaking delicious. Nice and juicy with having too much grease.   The service was excellent, and everyone that I interacted with was super friendly.  Cash or check only which is a bummer."}
{"text":"So, this place feels like you went back in time. It's an old school diner with a few new things. They accept cards now, btw.  The food is definitely diner food, but it's filling and tastes good. I could eat their pancakes without syrup all day. I love a pancake that isn't bland. My 2 pancakes and 4 sausage links were filling and I literally could not make myself eat my last two bites of pancake. The haystack my fianc√© got covered the plate and he had to leave 3 bites on the plate because it was so filling.   The service is not bad. Especially since we chose to sit at the counter. It's not a big place, so I don't suggest coming with a big group, but if you need filling, good food at a good price this is the place. The menu is not huge, so it makes it easier to narrow down if you want breakfast or lunch. The bill came out to be $19 and some change before tip.   Of course we'll be back. It's a Rantoul staple to eat at Ott's."}
{"text":"Stopped here because of the reviews on yelp. The service was wonderful and the food was worth paying for. So if your ever traveling thru Rantoul and your on I-57 they not far off so it's worth. Real biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"I was there last week for a burger, The service was great the burger was very good. The owner and his son are both very friendly guys. All the breakfast stuff is fresh except the biscuits.  Another visit more excellent service and very good food."}
{"text":"Cool old fashioned diner. Reminds me of a Waffle House, but in an old old building. Good food, friendly and very clean."}
{"text":"Great traditional diner ambiance. Pancakes were good and the bacon was cooked to perfection.  Biscuits and gravy lacked taste and my husbands scrambled eggs were over cooked. Overall good breakfast for the money."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff!! Full diner experience with food that taste homemade but much better! Only one complaint at all and that is why in the world would a breakfast/diner thats only open til 3pm be closed on Sundays???? It probably be their busiest day but nope. I could see closing Monday and Tuesday but closing Sunday is just plain wrong. Bars dont close on Friday so breakfast places shouldnt be closed on Sundays! Other then that best place ever! Try the haystack!  Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"If you crave true Americana then look no further than Otts. It's a dinner that time forgot and in a nice way. It's a clean and easy to get to dinner tucked away on Rantoul Illinois North edge of town on Route 45, East side. Open for breakfast and lunch Tuesday thru Saturday. The made from scratch sausage gravy is the best I've had from a restaurant. Try the chili, it won't disappoint you. I've been visiting Otts for over 40 years and other than the reasonable prices keeping pace, this gem of a dinner is unchanged and I love that."}
{"text":"French toast done nicely. Egg cooked to order. Bacon super crispy, a little too much so. Husband had half haystack. He said it was \"okay\", potatoes could have been browned more. Coffee was good.   Noisy environment and board-hard seats are the drawback here. Just reopened and I had hoped for improvements on these issues, but no change was made. Maybe this is the atmosphere the regular customers like?"}
{"text":"Fabulous food. Great service! It's a 10 star to me. The BEST sausage gravy I've ever eaten! This place had the best hash browns my wife has ever eaten according to her. Very clean, the only fault is that the booths are somewhat small. I only wish we lived closer so we could stop in more. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Every Foodie gets born somewhere. Even before they really know they are one. Sigmund Freud once said, \"a child leaves the womb because its craving diner food.\" (ok, something like that) But for this Foodie, I was born into this path at Ott's Drive-In. My earliest Foodie memory was around 8 or 9 years of age, and the fantastic treat of my father taking me or my brother and I there early Saturday mornings and to order what seemed to be taboo, but amazingly so for a breakfast, an \"Ott Burger\" with a vanilla or chocolate milkshake! The Ott Burger is a half pounder on Texas toast and of course, milkshakes are hand made.Their Biscuits & Gravy are huge favorites too, and as a child encountering the little chunks of peppery sausage, fired my desire to always seek new things.  When there as a child, we'd sit at one of the 14 spinning, chrome & cushioned stools at the counter, or switch it up and do one of the original formica booths, but never too far from the grill. I wanted to see all of the action and how it was done! When those diced onions or onion rings hit the flattop and began to sound, I was either destined to become a composer, or a Foodie and you can guess how it turned out. I love music but it just doesn't have much going for the nose. Even though a child of the 1970's, I could tell this place was special and somehow,sensed it history. I have recollections of an old jukebox, pinball machines, chrome candy machine (LOVE THOSE), old bulky cigarette machines (even a strange cigar one), shiny black & white tiles checkered across the floor. Much of those things were removed as I grew up, but everything else original, intact, and less a fire in the 1960's that closed it for a few months, it retains its character of the past. Ott's is one of the long survivors in the cannon of American Diners at 42 years. Perhaps not as long as The Arcade of 1919 in Memphis, TN, but as far as those whom live for something more authentic of that mid-20th century era, Ott's is still keeping old school diner alive. Before \"fast food\" became the stuff of clone and cancer, the drive up, drive in, or in Ott's case, \"drive to, park and go inside,\" was the standard. The original owner, Othmer Mayer (died in 1978), had designed it to have a drive thru window, but it compromised the parking and never happened. In its heyday, when the town of Rantoul still had its Chanute Air Force Base, it was pretty much open til Midnight every night. Those diner days of \"Nighthawks\" are long gone sadly, but they do breakast and lunch every day but Sunday & Monday. A shame that they don't open it back up to the youth of the town as it would give them something more wholesome than hanging out in the parking lot of Arby's, but that's just me. At least they're still holding down the classical fort in other ways. Ott's Drive-In resides on the edge of my hometown, near old Rt 45 where it feels like you're leaving small town America and traveling to nothing all at once. So in a way, it sits on the edge of vanquish, but there's something prolific about a great diner being the last landmark before the town vanishes behind (or starts, depending on your view). Which is a statement of the diner journey for the Foodie. Classic diners are like little churches for our mortal appetites, where we dial it back to simple and recenter. Or, like me, with Ott's, if just to get back in touch with my eternal Foodie child self. Foodies are travelers on roads in search of, and we need a good meal in our bellies before we venture on. For me, and others, Ott's Drive-In is an outward post on the Foodie Soul's Eternal Sojourn and may it live forever."}
{"text":"Only reason they lost a star is the cash only option! Very inconvenient! Best biscuits and gravy in town! Very cozy, homey feel."}
{"text":"I went here with mom after she came down to visit me in Paxton, Illinois, where I am a teacher!  Needless to say, I was looking for a local joint and had been suggested by one of the locals here in Paxton. The food was excellent! I got a Western Omelet (more on this later) and instead of toast I got cottage cheese. I also added a grilled chicken breast just for the hell of it. That was great too...love me some hot sauce. I even went  up to the counter to get that hot sauce since our waitress...left something to be desired.  After I got said hot sauce (joking around with the woman in a Cubs shirt,  telling her she was the \"best\" since she was nice enough to grab it for me...besides that shirt...she yelled GIVE IT BACK)  that was great...  Anyway, our waitress gave us a few minutes to order. I couldn't decide between an omelet and just scrambled eggs with ham. I decided to ask her what the Western Omelet entailed. She said tomato, green pepper, onion, mushroom, and ham. Now being the idiot that I am, I took her at her word. I should have just special ordered since that is what I usually do. Since I was getting cottage cheese I thought, eh, what the hell right? I got my cheese for the day...but she did not tell me the omelet included cheddar cheese. I am glad it was in there, but what if I was allergic or something? I am to blame for this as well, but come on Ott!  I would have given four stars for sure...but the whole refill of water (I had to go to the counter and I am hoping the woman didn't spit in that refill) thing that I dealt with, going to the counter myself....THAT IS NOT SERVICE WITH A SMILE!  Would I go back? Yes, if I wanted diner style eating. I would not sit in this gals' section.   I was going to get a t shirt to show the world that I'd eaten at Ott's. But the service turned me office. I will keep that 12 dollars!  For my mom and I it was 20.45. Good and cheap!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat at. The Haystack filled me up. The sausage and gravy was very good. The cook was very friendly the hours are perfect to go early. It came with toast on bottom layer of hash browns, 3 pieces of bacon, sausage gravy, two eggs and toast on top. It was perfect meal to start the day."}
{"text":"Right in line with the DDD tradition, Ott's is as close to a 'Dive Diner' as you can get.  Sit at the counter and you feel like you could reach across and flip your own burger.  Watching what goes on and the family atmosphere, no wonder you can't find a seat at prime time.  Great value, great food."}
{"text":"A great place or Breakfast, Brunch or Lunch!!! Smiling faces and Amazing food!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and generous for the price!!! Unfortunately, that comes at a sacrifice. The poor servers are wayyyyy understaffed to handle the Sunday potential. It took 20 minutes for our first drink refill and just over 30 minutes to get our food from the time we ordered it. We both ordered ham cheese and mushroom omelets with has browns and tater tots and again, for the price, they were generous and it was quite tasty!! If I was to be picky, onions and green peppers would be nice, but for now, it's about time for Ott's to revisit human resources class in order to ensure general customer volume demand is met efficiently. If this Sunday was a fluke, there should be more than enough 5-star reviews that will offset this 3-star review."}
{"text":"I always love my experience at otts     The new ownership is trying to provide that great otts tradition.  A great place for breakfast.   Staff works hard and is very pleasant."}
