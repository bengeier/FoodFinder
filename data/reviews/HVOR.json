{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night, with a group of 6. We were all really excited since we had heard such good things about the food. 

Starting off with the pros:
- great service, very attentive but not overbearing or invasive. 
- beautiful locale, the space is well designed and inviting.
- the dishes are very creative, no two dishes are the same.

Cons:
The food itself wasn't that great. We had the in-house mortadella with pesto focaccia, the lettuce with shrimp and Jerusalem artichokes, the duck foie gras, halibut on a bed of pine purée and roasted pintade with persimmon and daikon radish. Most menu fixe, multi-service restaurants that I've been to have a narrative or common theme that ties the dishes together and makes the meal stand out. However, at HVOR, it just seemed like a jumbled mess. The pairings were awkward and while I can appreciate the uniqueness and the creativity, some things just don't pair well together. The halibut was incredibly disapointing, because not only was the fish overcooked, the pine purée really didn't add anything to it. There was a strange aftertaste that didn't sit well. The highlight of the service was the pintade. The rest I could have done without. 

To be honest, for the price that I paid, I would have rather gone back to Bouillon Blk."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this time I feel I have to. I had high expectations of this restaurant and I ended up very disappointed. Seems like the chef is trying to be so inventive that he forgets what good taste is. Don't import ingredients from all over the world just for the sake of mixing it in some random, not really palatable way, and boosting the price. Our night's highlight: wild mushrooms are not meant to be grilled and undercooked! They get bitter and are hard to digest. Madeleine cake with matcha had nothing to do with any version of this cake. Not to mention matcha overdose, bitterness and dark green color. I know matcha is a hype now but don't just throw it in kilos. I could go on and on about what was wrong with other dishes we ordered.. anyway, the bottom line is: overrated, pretentious, another mtl hype,  and \"form over content\". Great quality ingredients won't make the taste just thrown together randomly."}
{"text":"The most overpromised, hyped up disaster of a meal I have ever had in Montreal. Over cooked rabbit, venison carpaccio that was buried in a mountain of cheese \"foam\" and a $100 bottle of cotes de Provence... vintage 2016!  Trash, garbage, rubbage with a phony air of gastronomy. Steer clear of this facade of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"HVOR was absolutely fantastic! Loved this restaurant and their mission to use as many local ingredients as possible - including from their own garden! The staff was extremely knowledgeable, kind, and accommodating. The kitchen was kind enough to modify one main and I was able to switch out a dessert wine pairing. (Only slight improvement for the staff might be timing... delivery of beverages, time between check-ins, etc.) Each course was delightful and different.  Note: For dinner service there is either a 3-course or 5-course tasting menu, items are not revealed prior.  I would highly recommend HVOR and return in a heartbeat - sadly I don't live in Montreal! Other items for reference: We went as a couple on vacation, for dinner on Sunday evening. I travel frequently and eat out at least 4 times/week."}
{"text":"We went for diner and drinks, started with cocktails and had an emergency so we had to leave... when asked for the bill we were told that they couldn't let us go because we needed to consume food! 
It seems that this place doesn't have a license to sell alcohol, hence you are obliged to buy food... but nobody tells you that!"}
{"text":"fantastic experience??
I really like the live menu! Must try! 
The honey butter is like WOW sooo good!!"}
{"text":"So I went to HVOR last night for the MTL a Table special menu because I had heard such great things about this place and wanted to try it out for myself. I have to say considering the price point (special fixed menu) it really wasn't worth it (tastewise). The service was great, the decor is beautiful and the food looked fantastic. But the taste...was lackluster. Nothing was wow. Nothing was memorable and nothing was mouthwatering.

So due to that fact, I doubt I'll ever go back nor will I recommend this place to any of my friends...it's a shame because I had such high hopes for it."}
{"text":"Had one of the best meals I've had in Montreal (and I've had a LOT of meals out in this city). Great food, wine, service, decor and company. Enjoyed the chef's tour of the garden too!"}
{"text":"The place has been open for a little over a week now so I had low expectations in terms of service as a previous review mentioned. I was pleasantly surprised that our three course dinner was done within an hour and a half and we also got to visit their garden! After being seated by the host your waiter/waitress comes to your table offering you sparkling or flat water and explains you their concept: you choose either the 3 (45$ + extra 30$ for wine pairing) or 5 (65$ or 60$ vegetarian + extra 45$ for wine pairing) course dinner, tell them your food restrictions and based on that the chef decides what to serve you. The menu only says prices as I mentioned therefore there are no food description and no ingredients... so I don't feel this is the ideal place for picky eaters. We we're served: grilled asparagus on pistachio pesto with dill and anchovies (oh so good), homemade buckwheat pasta in butter lobster sauce with roasted tomatoes and lobster meat (incredible), and a little Japanese cheesecake with mango, strawberry and rhubarb (every bite was delicious). The service was fantastic, the wine pairings were delicious and for the quality and freshness of the ingredients along with presentation and taste, 45$ for 3 courses (as well as the amuses-bouches at the beginning and the mignardises at the end) was a very reasonable price. I was satisfied with my three-course dinner and wine pairing, my boyfriend still felt like he needed a little more food so those with bigger appetites should opt for the 5 course menu. I loved every moment of my experience at HVOR and recommend to every foodie in town."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks - the bartender was fantastic at making us surprise drinks. We got the five course and it ended up being like eight dishes. All of it was so delicious and worth every penny. On top of it, they have a beautiful interior design and patio garden. I highly recommend checking out this restaurant."}
{"text":"Dined at HVOR about few weeks ago. The space is simple, fresh, and modern. The food was inventive and good. The pork loan wrapped in some sort of cured pork was my favorite. Would give it a 5 star but found it a bit pricey for the portion sizes. Would revisit."}
{"text":"If you like your amuse bouche served on a rock, this is your sort of place. Overall excellent experience as others have described, with some minor quibbles on one or two of the dishes. Note they now have an a la carte menu, which overlaps with the tasting. Dietary restrictions are generally accommodated."}
{"text":"We came to HVOR last week on the basis of a number of strong reviews, and a desire to taste more local Quebec produce. While it lived up to the latter qualification, the prices charged ($90 for prix fixe menu, a la carte entrees up to $50) weren't justified by the delivery. Servers pushed really hard for the prix fixe, but won't tell you what's on the prix fixe selection at that time, so you're trying it totally blind. A la carte presentations were very good, and ingredients were fresh. But some mixtures just didn't mesh, and the value:quality equation was out of whack. Charging $30 for a (small) pasta & mushroom dish didn't jive. Dinner for 3 with 1 very modest bottle of wine was $350."}
{"text":"Great Service, ambiance and ingredients.....the content of the plates however were nothing memorable. We chose the three course meal, the two first dishes were mainly vegetables (aside from a strand of anchovies), then came desert which was excellent.

More of trendy place."}
{"text":"Quelle belle découverte. De surprise en surprise, le menu accordé avec le vin était tout simplement délicieux. On adore le concept : pas de menu, juste le choix du chef qui s'assure de ne pas ajouter d'aliments qu'on n'aime pas !"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this incredible and somewhat magical restaurant - the food, the service, the ambiance - everything was just. perfect. Just as it should be. The night flew effortlessly and we didn't even notice how nearly hour hours have passed. 

Having dined at best restaurants all over the world, it takes a while to impress me. I just had dinner a couple of months ago at Russia's best restaurant where they had 3 waiters and a personal butler serving us a platter of reserve caviar. 

However, I really think, there is something undeniably special about this place. As the name implies, the theme evolves around fresh locally grown vegetables, so most of the dishes were vegetable centric. This is not carnivore, this is herbivore, so if you come in expecting giant pieces of steak, you'll leave disappointed. 

Our meal was light, delicious and very pleasant. The cocktails were on point. The wine pairing was wonderful and they fully customized it to our requests (only dry whines). We did the five course menu and it ended up being more like a 7 course menu between an extra starter they give you and an extra dessert. The second desert was unnecessary but looked so delicious, it was hard to resist. 

Our server was friendly, attentive, kind and very personable. The kind of guy who could your best friend in another life.  We showed up early when the restaurant opened and so we got to sit in the garden with all the beautiful vegetables growing behind us enjoying the beautiful scenery of fresh produce and inhaling aromas of fresh herbs. They don't take reservations for the outdoor area, so come early for the garden seating. 

All in all, a total win, might be my new favorite restaurant in Montreal - will definitely come back on my next trip here."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy paying 2x the price and getting 1/2 the portions? If so, read on!
Your wallet will despise you and you'll STILL need to pay for another meal afterwards thanks to the micro portion sizes.
Very attentive staff, nice atmosphere. Can't argue there.
Unfortunately, the food fell a bit short..enough to annoy me to the point of writing this review. Quality was slightly above average but the quantities were hilariously tiny. This is one of those restaurants where their meals only occupy 1/3 of the plate for \"style\" or something. My GF actually thought the waiter served us a unfinished plate cleared from another table as our appetizer.
Your money will be better spent at Foxy (or even Milos) where you get the same level of attentiveness, excellent quality food, and portions that actually warrant the price tag at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Extremely fresh, unique flavor combinations, and great service. The interior is very chic too.  All around incredible food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"They grow their vegetables in the garden, they buy locally. You can certainly taste how fresh their ingredients are. We had the tasting menu and the mix of flavours in each dish was remarkable. But the portions surely could be a little larger....service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Quoting Justin Timberlake \"Cry me a river\" of Happiness when my tastebuds met Chef S'Arto Chartier-Otis creations at HVOR. Voted on Eater- as people 's choice best restaurant in 2016. I had to try out this new happening spot. 

I had no trouble making reservations. The menu is fixed with 4-6 courses at cost of around 100$ or with wine pairings 150$ (highly recommended- you get around 3 glasses complimenting each meal.) The menu changes seasonally and uses local produce. (Another plus supporting our local farmers!) 
 
I started my meal at 6:30pm and finished at 10:00 pm! What a foodie field trip- to name a few items containing a beautiful sugar glazed cranberry salad with hidden shrimp, main courses including -aged trout, duck tartar, 45 day aged steak with artichoke cooked 3 ways and scallops, MIND BLOWING! I enjoyed every bite of the delicate artistry and even had the chance to speak with Chef Otis talk about how he came up with the menu. 

And cool thing- you get a sample of the the menu in souvenir form with a local dried tisane. BRILLIANT! 

This venue stole my heart. Move over Lou Boutin purchase- I am spending on this Chef's delight."}
{"text":"Summary: one one of a kind restaurant worth the night in Montreal, or even a trip TO Montreal. 

I visited Montreal for a long weekend with 3 friends, 2 of which are from Norway. We stumbled across Hvor on Montreal.Eater.com and the name immediately caught our attention --as it means \"where\" in Danish and Norwegian. They chose this name for the restaurant, as they do not want to limit them selves to one specific food type. \"If we get good fish from Japan, we will make it.\" 

Concept: no menu. You can chose the 3 or 5 course menu at $45 or $75, respectively. There is a $30 and $50 wine pairing option as well. These prices are incredibly reasonable, as the food is top quality, organic, and grown in house or on a local farm. Furthermore, if you're an American, you're scoring a 3 course meal WITH wine pairing for $55. You could never find that in Boston. The waitress will ask for any dietary restrictions or things you don't eat - and then your meal is made ! Personally, I love this. It forced me to eat food that I would not normally order. 

Good: superb. We had the 3 course, wine pairing. We started with an incredibly fresh Oyster with some sort of a cream sauce inside. This was not one of the courses, but rather an amuse-bouche. 

1. Grilled asparagus, with pistachios, green olives, and a few other things. This was a decent sized portion. It was complimented with a Grenache of sorts. Every wine Hvor selected pulled out the flavors of each dish. 

2. Miso-based soup with lobster, prawn, Japanese fish, and potatoes. Incredible. 

3.  Honey Mille-feuilles: so flakey, so good. This was paired with an extremely floral yellow dessert wine from Quebec. We finished with another dessert amuse-Bouche

Our friend has a dairy allergy, which they accommodated. They wade sure they explained every plate they brought out and emphasized the ingredients of the dairy free option. During the dessert portion, they even went as far as to make her a cocktail which would better compliment her lemon sorbet. 

Atmosphere: beautiful. We felt as if we were back in Norway or Denmark. They definitely put a lot of thought into the design. Simple lights, straight lines, ash wood. It was simply stunning. After dinner, our waitress invited us up to see the garden. We were able to see all of the vegetables we ate that night ! 

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try something new, have a great experience, and get value for their money."}
{"text":"4 étoiles pour la qualité de la nourriture, leurs efforts quant au service et à la pousse de leurs propres herbes et petits légumes bio. Génial. Le menu de ce soir était un menu surprise; les convives choisissent entre un menu 3 ou 5 services avec option d'accord mets et vins. Le seul hic était le loooong temps d'attente. 2:45 pour un 3 services c'est extrêmement long. Mais nous allons sûrement y revenir pour voir l'évolution."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday dinner to new local hot spot Hvor.  Apparently \"hvor\" means \"where\" but in my dictionary, it means \"yum\".

The space is open and bright, minimalist without feeling industrial or sterile.  It's a set 5 course tasting menu, though they do take food intolerances and preferences into account.  Not sure how far they go with this, so this may not be a place for vegetarians or really picky eaters.  

First up was an amuse bouche of brussel sprouts stuffed with foie gras.  Very cleverly done and flavourful but a little too rich for me.  Next was grilled broccoli with a clam sauce... sounds weird, tasted amazing .  Second best plate of the night.

Third up to bat was blood pudding.  In the right hands, blood pudding can be delicious, and so it was.  Then a lovely piece of duck breast, followed by the winner of the night, a gorgeous duck ravioli.   

Dessert was spot on too, with a delicious pear and chocolate confection and then a few little petit fours to round off the night.  Portions were well sized, by the end of the feast, I was pleasantly but not uncomfortably full.  

I had the wine pairing with dinner, all excellent choices from France and Italy.  Really enhanced the experience.  

Service was top notch as well.  With a multi course dinner like this, it's so importance to pace each course and they really got it right.

Can't wait for a return visit!  One of my new favourite places in Montreal."}
{"text":"Very good food and great experience. I was at first skeptical that I wouldn't even get full but I was wrong. My friend and I shared an appetizer (beef tartare) and 2 main dishes (sirloin and trout). We were very full afterwards but still had place for dessert. Everything was tasty but my favourite was definitely the beef tartare."}
{"text":"The moment one steps into this restaurant, they know they are in a special place! From the active (and large) garden on the roof used to feed all their patrons fresh fruits and veggies, to the real beehive used to serve fresh honey, this place has \"organic\" down to a science! The service was excellent thanks to wine sommelier Fred Fortin who is very knowledgeable on all the wines he paired up perfectly with our 5 courses. Big thanks also goes out to my friend Eric Jenson for giving me the VIP tour, and information on all the fresh cuisine we were soon to eat, as well as his tasty cocktail served up to me! His welcome alone was worth the visit... This place is a hit, and so refreshingly exciting. It's a welcome addition to the already wonderful Montreal restaurant scene!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in Montreal that serves an amazingly good tasting menu.  It's affordable, the service is excellent.  Our waiter took tremendous pride in this new restaurant.  He was knowledgeable about the menu.  He even showed us their garden.

The decor is very nice and you don't feel overly crowded.  

HVOR will be a success.  I suspect that in a couple of months it will be very difficult to get a reservation."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of incredible. The atmosphere is clean and neat and remains at the perfect volume. The staff is so far beyond accommodating and pleasant that a new measure should be required.. and on to the food: the tasting/pairing is artful, flavorful, and changed to mind of my comfort-food pleased American boyfriend with its intense flavor and creative execution. This is a must-have in Montreal. A page-turner of cuisine."}
{"text":"Great food and presentation overall but the portions were extremely small and all vegetarian. For $70 and a five course meal I expect some meat. We mentioned one of our party members could not eat duck but we said everything else was fine. I am not sure if that would explain why we got all vegetarian. Although, I find that inexcusable. I am on the fence about going back again unless they increase their portion and/or content."}
{"text":"HVOR have been on my list for a long time and I finally got the chance to go there last Saturday evening. We had previously reserved as it always gets full. 

The local and decor are very nice, it's simple and has an modernized industrial touch with weak lighting which makes it cozy and convivial.

You can chose from the menu but basically the concept is to have the Tasting Menu (100$ or 150$ with wine pairing) through which the Chef makes you discover 5 to 6 dishes (entrée, main and deserts). The Tasting Menu changes partially or completely every week.

We went with the Tasting Menu and every dish was amazing. There is a story that the Chef wants to tell behind every dish and this makes the experience unique. The portion are not very big, however the high quality and rarity of the products and ingredients used in those exquisite dishes and their association with the main ingredient of it is what makes the plate excellent.

Again the portion are not big and you might still be a little hungry towards the end of the 2h tasting menu experience, but by coming to HVOR you have to know what you are coming for and that is to have a unique culinary experience and taste & discover products and flavor combination that you won't do somewhere else.

The service was top!! Our waitress (Anne-Rose) was smiling the whole time and was very friendly (in a professional way of course). She knew her menu as well as her wine list, same goes for the other members of the staff who were very passionate and knowledgeable about the dishes they were serving.

Amazing experience from A to Z. I would definitely recommend this place if you are passionate about food and like to try culinary experiences."}
{"text":"Reading all the reviews of this relatively new restaurant, I was very excited to try the 6 course tasting menu ($90 or $140 with wine pairings). I was not disappointed. The menu is very creative, and the wine pairings which my husband enjoyed, perfectly complemented the different tastes. The standouts were the halibut and the dessert. My husband raved about the tatami filet mignon. The rabbit liver was very good (and I am not the most adventurous eater). The salad was good too. The gnocchi was my least favourite, as it wasn't as creative or flavourful as the other plates. The amuse bouche consisted of tuna, which was amazing. I had the purple smash drink and it was delicious! They grow their own flowers on the roof and place them on the dishes. It's a very trendy looking place, adjacent to downtown. They want to become the best restaurant in Montreal in two years, and I wish them great success! Come here when you want to celebrate a big milestone!

Service was attentive and friendly. 

As it's quite expensive, I wasn't blown away, but it is very good!"}
{"text":"Had the five course tasting menu with cocktails. The dishes were fresh, creative and simple and heavy on vegetables and herbs from their rooftop garden which I loved!  The entire staff was very kind, the atmosphere unpretentious.  I tried a new blueberry cocktail concoction at dinner that lacked a name. If you guys read this, my friend and I came up with 'bixi berry' (while riding our bixi rental bikes around Montreal the next day.)"}
{"text":"Definitely not a meal for the poor!

Menu degustation: $90
With wine pairing: $140

I had read previously that that tasting menu was $65 + $45 for the wine pairing so I was really surprised to see the increase when I saw the menu.

$140/ person this meal better be more than fantastic and the wine mind blowing!....although the food was really good (tiny portions) and the wine paired well, I didn't leave the place with a feeling that the experience blew me away.

You are supposed to get at least 5 courses in the tasting menu and we got 8 excluding the tiny amuse mouche. I have to say that I was worried about not being full at the end of my meal because the portions were so tiny that you had to fore yourself not to eat it all in one bite, but by the end of our meal I was ok in terms of good in my stomach. 

The restaurant opened in 2016 and has the goal of becoming Montreal 's best restaurant in 2 years. Although food was good, I don't think it is the best restaurant I had been to in Montreal...especially for the price they charge. 

If I was loaded, if probably return. For now, I would prefer to spend that kind of money trying another restaurant."}
{"text":"Second visit to Hvor and it has taken a turn for the worst. Last time was five stars +++. Service, food, experience very professional and in line with the cost. Unfortunately the recent experience was very disappointing and definitely did not reflect the cost. The tasting menu is no longer available but replaced with a \"live menu\". Despite including allergy information in the online reservation and reminding the server (who was not aware!) plates with allergens were brought to the table. Nut allergies are becoming more prevalent and in most restaurants the chef can modify the dish (or modify select dishes). Not the case here. Two choices were offered (out of about 20 in total) and chef could not modify any of the others. In fairness the manager did offer a complimentary lobster entree which was delicious. All food choices ordered were served cold and portion sizes were more tasting menu size (correct there is NO tasting menu anymore). It felt more like a lunch serving versus dinner. It was also a birthday celebration and I spoke to someone at the resto the day before who said they would speak to the \"pastry chef\" as the person celebrating had some dietary restrictions. The \"special\" dessert consisted of two thin shards of chocolate and a few blueberries on a dinner sized plate with bonne fete written in centre of the plate. Sidebar at other restaurants claiming to be 4-5 star I have experienced the restaurant buying a diet appropriate dessert from a bakery if they could not supply one (when informed in advance). That extra step shows genuine interest in making the experience a positive one. Our waitress tried her best but admitted to it being her first day. She didn't seem to be getting any support from her colleagues and despite her best efforts was not familiar with the menu or the level of service expected in this calibre of restaurant. We felt bad for her. She should have shadowed a more experienced waiter which would have been helpful to her and provided us with a more professional experience. Despite being half full one waiter even mistakenly brought two bottles of wine meant for another table. So food was not great, service was sub-optimal, and the value for the cost was not appropriate.  In a very competitive market with more restaurants opening in the Griffintown area Hvor needs to perhaps rethink how they are servicing their customers and be more attentive to their needs."}
{"text":"Have had some amazing meals this year, Michelin star places in Barcelona, top restaurants in Peru and NY. Hvor ranks right up there, no question. Love the surprise menu. It was super creative and delicious. Home made vegetable ravioli was unreal, and the final main of duck was out of this world. Make sure to ask them how they prepare it! Days of prep time. Phillipe the sommelier and waiter is a character. 

Awesome awesome awesome place."}
{"text":"We were early so normal atmosphere was average. 

Service was great. Knowledge. Personable. Conversational rather than scripted. 

Food was unique and excellent."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing experience! Must go! Should do 5 courses! Caroline was amazing as well as all the other staff members! All of them knew about food and wine! My mom is a picky eater and she ate and loved the grilled octopus! Wine pairing was done well! Very clean! Very comfortable, modern setting. If I could I would give this 10 stars!  Everything is fresh!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars for great potential. It opened two months ago, so it's still establishing itself. I came with my boyfriend on vacation. He lived in Denmark previously and has eaten at all the top rated restaurants. We both agreed it was the best meal we had had in North America and on par with some of the best dining in Europe. Make sure to do the full 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing. You won't regret it! They can accommodate any food restrictions. My boyfriend and I split one wine pairing since we didn't want to drink much. The wines they chose really complemented each dish though. 

I'm sure this place will be Michelin rated within the year and it will soon be hard to get a reservation. 

The few areas for improvement are the music and service. The music was all over the place and didn't match the otherwise very tasteful and minimalist Danish design of the restaurant. Our server was very friendly, we loved chatting with her, but she made a couple of mistakes and nobody grabbed our coats at the end of the night. I'm sure these both can be remedied. I still highly recommend dinner there."}
{"text":"This meal over-delivered and exceeded expectations. Loved the juxtaposition of Scandinavian design, and Italian and Japanese cooking methods and recipes. Got way more food than I expected, and the courses told a story from dish to dish. Ask how they prepare the duck, I dare you. Special shouts to Phillippe who was just great to interact with and learn from!"}
{"text":"I went to HVOR tonight and it was a great experience! The menu consists of a three course or five course meal and they have approximately fifteen dishes that they can make and distribute so everyone at one table will get the same thing but one table will not get the exact same dishes as another table. It depends on your allergies and it's totally random. They cannot tell you what dishes you will get beforehand so it's a complete surprise. The waiter explains each dish to you as you receive it. There's also an option of getting the wine pairing but I just got one glass of red. I can only imagine that it's probably even better with the wine pairing. The presentation of the food is really nice and they use fresh produce. The portions are small so I recommend the five course tasting rather than the three. We started off with an amuse bouche. I will try to describe everything but I'm sure I will butcher some of it. We had this bite sized chip with mustard from France and carrots on top followed by a fancy salad that had smoked lettuce with a cream of smoked scallops and basil. Then we had this dish that was like a deconstructed sandwich. On the plate there were slices of ham with pickles, turnip and mustard all mixed together accompanied by slices of bread. Next we had slices of hirame fish with zucchini and zucchini blossom. I've never heard of this fish before but apparently it's from Japan. It was so good! Then we had the cavatelli with kale and clams in a miso sauce. After that we were told by the waiter that dessert would be served next. Honestly up until this point the food was good but it didn't blow my mind.... but then ....we got a main of lobster with hollandaise sauce!! That was a game changer for me! OMG it was delicious! The ladies next to us saw how good it looked and asked if they could get the same. Haha Then instead of getting one dessert we got two! We had the clafoutis with cherries on top. It was bite sized and it was perfection. Not too sweet and not too filling. We also had a blood orange sorbet with a meringue on top and they set the whole thing on fire in front of us. It was paired with a glass of Clemant de loire which is like a bubbly. I would give this place six stars if I could because not only was the food very good the chef was really generous!! Food and service was amazing! We were there for almost four hours!"}
{"text":"Last weekend my beau and I treated ourselves to an anniversary outing at HVOR. I was pretty stoked after hearing wonderful things from the foodie community about this spot so I was expecting a lot. That being said, the date was great, the restaurant experience was just OK for me.

The main thing I'd say that dampened things was that while we had specified that my boyfriend is vegan in our reservation our server acted a little surprised and wasn't really sure what we could order \"but like, can you make an exception for yogurt?\". After consulting with the chef (which I do appreciate) he gave us some options. We ordered the two plates that were veganizable, as well as a vegetarian dish for me, and then our server insisted that we order more food, since the plates are small. We stuck with things as is, given that there was nothing else we were going to be able to share. As it turns out, it was enough food. After receiving our main plates I realized that they had held all the animal products that came with my gnocchi (whaddaya mean no cheese???) and replaced them with a bunch of veggies.
This was ok, but really just ok, I was very clear that it was just the man friend who was vegan.

Here's the thing, I'm extremely patient with places that may need some help getting there when it comes to vegan food. However, a place of this caliber, that deals with particulars, needs to pay more attention to detail when it comes to reservations and ordering. 

Additionally, the food itself was good, but nothing mind-blowing. Honestly, the cava we ordered was the best thing on the table."}
