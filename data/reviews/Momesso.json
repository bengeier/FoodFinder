{"text":"I had the chicken sub. Marinated chicken, topped with mayo, saut√©ed onions, sliced tomatoes, fresh homemade coleslaw, drizzled with their own special hot sauce. These recipes have probably never been changed, and the sheer idea of modification will disrupt the gastronomic harmony between all players. These subs don't come with substitutions or a choice of gourmet breads or calorie conscious alternatives. White bun, lightly toasted, plain and simple, that's what you're having, cos that's all they have."}
{"text":"Restaurant Momesso has great food. They are Italian and serve delicious 7 inch and 14 inch hot subs, which I would strongly recommend. I personally love the steak sandwich served spicy. The pizza is a little different than usual pizzas. Its a softer pizza, its definitely an acquired taste. Nonetheless, I think they have some delicious food, the fries are good, the subs are good and the overall price is pretty cheap.  The atmosphere is also amazing. They have multipule TVs and will play all the Montreal Canadiens games. They will also play Italian soccer games and the crowd can be pretty crazy for either of these events.   The staff is extremely friendly. Overall, it is a great casual restaurant, good for sports events and late night snacks. Great subs. Great food. Nice atmosphere. Nice people. Beer deals."}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah, everyone talks about the subs. It's their pizzas I love! Huge pieces of Italian sausage, tons of ingredients, their special spicy sauce which I have bought a bottle of in the past."}
{"text":"The first time I ever ate at Momesso's, the food was orgasmic. I ate there twice in a week just last week and neither time was very good. I tried to go in the summer but there was a sign in the window saying they were closed for renos. I guess the anticipation and memories of past visits got my hopes up! Even the two visits last week were not consistent. What hasn't changed, however, was the grease--MMMmmmm!  I always get the sausage and steak or just the steak sub, usually the full 14\" (~$14) just because I'm greedy like that. Sometimes I get my sub with onion rings, sometimes fries (they offer small which is a good size for ~$3 and large). Both are full-on greasy goodness and always cooked just right, served in the cafeteria-style no-nonsense plastic bowls. The onion rings are crispy with some light grease, and the fries are a little greasier with little oil blisters on them.   I'm seeing a lot of these fried onions / green peppers / mushrooms being tossed into steak subs these days and I can't say I'm loving it. I find each of those items when fried have their own flavor and it doesn't really add to the beefy flavour of the beef, if anything, I find it robs one of enjoying the good, beefy taste of the meat. On one occasion, there was no trace of cheese in my sub, and too little sub sauce (actually it's Italian dressing) on another. The sauce I could get over, but not the cheese. The other thing is that the fillings for the subs are getting noticeably smaller. What's up with that?   I was quite disappointed these past two times I ate at Momesso. The service was the only thing I couldn't complain about. That and their hot sauce. But why don't they sell the little jars of the stuff anymore??"}
{"text":"This place is an NDG institution. Great Italian sausage subs, friendly environment."}
{"text":"Literally the best steak subs I've ever had ! The service is always great and fast ! I always go and don't plan on stopping anytime soon ."}
{"text":"Loved the place. Excellent subs, clean place, quick and friendly service, reasonable prices... What more can you ask for? Try it!"}
{"text":"Quiznos, subway, eat your hearts out. No contest. The best steak and pepperoni sub I've ever had. I've heard much about their Italian sausage sub,  but steak and pepperoni has always been very dear to my heart so my first experience was S&P.  I was trying to have a light lunch so I ordered the 7\" sub. Next time 14\" for sure. It was over much too quickly. Maybe I'll have a 7\" of S&P and one sausage. I know I'm rambling but this was an amazing sub. If in the area around meal time, this is where I'm eating. GREAT STUFF."}
{"text":"Best Italian sandwich. I stop here every trip to Montreal. I absolutely love this sandwich. Fresh baked bread, homemade Italian sausage, homemade slaw and hot sauce."}
{"text":"Two words: sausage sub and sausage pizza.  Okay, that was five words, but who's really counting?  I've been coming to this place since I was a kid and it never disappoints. Make sure to ask them to make it spicy!"}
{"text":"I had dinner and drinks here with my husband, a few of his old highschool classmates, and their partners. It was a milestone reunion and the organizers decided that Momesso's would be a good place, and I have to agree. The food was good, not too expensive and it's a sports bar that didn't mind having 30-40 people who got a little loud at times, lol.  Momesso's looks and feels like a divey sports bar you'd find in Little Italy in Toronto in the 80's. They are famous for their subs, but they also have burgers and pizza.   My husband and I shared a 14\" steak sub ($16.50) and a small poutine ($6.50). We were just going to eat out of the same plate and bowl (we were sitting side by side), but I thought it was really nice of them to give us our halves of the sub on separate plates, and they even divided the poutine and put each half in separate bowls.   The steak sub had lots of meat in it, some cheese, sauteed bell peppers, mushrooms and shredded iceberg lettuce. It also had hot sauce in it, but not enough, so I added more, haha. They have extra hot sauce on the tables in little Solo Cups. The hot sauce is not like Frank's or Sriracha, it has pickled vegetables in it and it's a bit on the oily side. I liked the spicy kick but I didn't like the oil. The bread is toasted white submarine bread. I didn't think I would like the sub, but I actually did!   The poutine was also delicious. They were generous with the gravy and the cheese curds. The fries were delicious. They were crispy and slightly blistery. My husband said we should have paid an extra few bucks and gotten the large (this is after he finished his half and ate a significant portion of mine, lol).  Pitchers of beer were $18-$20 depending on the brand.  Staff were competent and efficient.  This is not a date night destination, at least not in my opinion. It's more a casual hangout to eat fast food, drink beer (although they also have wine and hard liquor), chat, and watch sports with friends. Or in our case, look at old yearbook pictures and laugh and try to figure out who is who, haha."}
{"text":"The spiecy sausage sub (italian style) and the tomato pizza with spiecy sausage are very original and exellent"}
{"text":"Amazing food love there subs (ask for extra spicy) has been a great place to eat at for many many years!"}
{"text":"It's a great place, definitely one of Montreal's great institution.  But the food... It's good, but not THAT good. I was expecting the subs (sausages) to be one of a kind, exceptional. They are not. Just normal (and somehow original) subs. Onion rings are great. Beer choice is bad."}
{"text":"This place is a 5 minute walk from Station Vendome, close to the Lachine Canal.  We ordered the supreme 7\", steak 14\", and large onion rings to share. Total came out to be around $32, which is pretty good considering the 14\" portion is big enough to be shared between two.   The supreme sub came with sausages, steak, peppers, tomato, lettuce, onions, mushrooms, cheese and spicy sauce. Their spicy sauce is soooo good, it really ups the flavour meter. Everything was super flavourful and it all blended well together.  The onion rings didn't taste homemade but it was still good. The large one can be shared between 2, maybe even 3.  Service was also very friendly, including the cook who took our order behind the kitchen.  All in all it was a very filling meal for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Momesso's sport's bar/restaurant is a long-standing family-run establishment located in Little Italy on Upper Lachine road in NDG. It is a 5-minute walk from the Vendome metro station. While much of the old Little Italy strip has changed over the years, Momesso's remains and is a true landmark. The restaurant carries the family name of a well known local hockey player who enjoyed a successful professional career in the NHL most notably with the Montreal Canadians and the Vancouver Canucks. This is the original location, located downstairs in the basement, a real neighbourhood dive.    While most people come here for the food, it is a great place to watch sporting events on the big screens. In fact, I find it to be an ideal place for larger groups of people(such as beer hockey and softball teams) as well as families. The submarines are what people come to this place to eat but there are many other good items on the menu. I come here frequently as I live in the area and have tried just about all the items on the menu.   First and foremost, they are liked for their Italian sausage submarines (spicy and hot) although I also like the Supreme (it contains both steak and sausage). They have great side orders as well. The onion rings (golden crispy) and the French fries and sauce are to die for, well cooked and golden brown. I have even tried their hamburgers which are good.  Finally, I really enjoy taking out one of their Italian sausage pizzas as I leave and eating it later on in the day. Momesso's is without a doubt one of the better known and liked restaurants in NDG. Try it once and you will return often! Cash only!"}
{"text":"Simply the best subs in Montreal...this place has been open for over 30 years and named after the former hockey player.  Theres is a couple of tvs and the style is cafeteria. But you dont come here for the decor. The sausage sub is simply amazing and you can add their special spicy sauce. The pizza with sausage, the hamburgers and the onion rings are the best.. A must try for sub lovers."}
{"text":"Went again last Friday and as usual it was great.  The two of us have been frequenting this place for lunch for over 20 years.  It is unpretentious where construction workers sit next to business people and everyone enjoys themselves.  Our favorite is the pizza with sausage, spicy and onions optional.  We love their Italian sausage which is cockoed to have a nice bit of crunchy crust. We also love their spicy pepper sauce, sometimes adding a few little cups of it to the pizza."}
{"text":"The spicey sausage sub is out of this world...legendary restaurant in Montreal. Everything is home made proprietary ingredients which make this place one of a kind...named after a hockey legend Sergio Momesso. I'm straight up addicted !!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and wanted to try this place for ever. I love Montreal's old school diners, and this one had that feel. But nice and friendly inside too.  Ordered 7\" sub, onion rings, and a beer, and loved it. Server was super friendly. Filling portions for reasonable prices. Full bar. Cool place.  I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"The best sausage sub west of Caf√© Milano in St. Leo. Always great. The bread is to die for. My advice? Get spicy, if you can handle spice. It adds just the right amount of kick. I can't comment on any other menu items because I always get the sausage sub. It's awesome."}
{"text":"I grew up in the neighborhood and went to what used to be the elementary school around the corner on Old Orchard (I believe it's some business school or something now) and I can tell you that this place not only has a rich history with the neighborhood, but it has some of the best greasy food in the city.  If you feel like throwing calorie caution to the wind, then CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!  Not only is it a part of Montreal history, but hockey history as well, being owned by the family of hockey player Sergio Momesso.    Great burgers, great subs, great fries, great everything!  The prices are great and the staff is super friendly.  A definite go to for anyone living or visiting the NDG area!"}
{"text":"Owned by ex-Montreal Canadien Sergio Momesso and his family. This place rocks! Awesome Italian Sausage Subs here (Which is what they're really known for), always ask for it \"spicy\". I also enjoy a spicy cheeseburger here too. Very affordable with sports on the TV screens. Good spot on Saturday afternoons. *Closed on Sundays!*"}
{"text":"My favorite sub place in Montreal. Outside decor aside, once you walk in you're greeted with a friend face. Service is quick and efficient.   Subs are what this place is all about. Fries are good but the onion rings are THE WAY THE NEED TO BE MADE.  Price is just right.  You can even watch the game if you're there at night."}
{"text":"Good Sub in the Deege              or Opening a Can of Worms     Having recently moved to St. Henri, Momesso's is now on my way home from Honey's so I have been frequenting the place, of late. Actually I am eating the leftovers for breakfast as we speak.    Now, when the question of 'the best sub in Montreal' comes up, there is no doubt that someone in the room will mention Momesso's and rightfully so but personally, I am still a Manzo's man.   Although, I would put that 'hot sauce' on my cornflakes so I will give them that.   I also have a special place for their sausage burgers, smothered in slaw...aside from my colon.

{"text":"Best burgers in Montreal. End of story. Pizza, subs, great espresso, everything a fast food joint should be. Noisy, and very busy at lunch, especially Thursdays. The staff has been there since forever, and it is always a treat to say 'hi'."}
