{"text":"I made reservations for 12ppl in advanced for the 25th. I was told that the last seating will be around 8pm but was able to reserve a 9:30pm time-slot (probably because I had a big group and 18% gratuity would be  automatically added -smart). I was also told that the dining area is fully booked for the night and I would get a private room for my party. There was also suppose to be a live DJ in the lounge but there wasn't. Oh yea, this night was for my birthday. 

The morning of, I got a call to confirm my booking and made sure everything would be as promised. I was running late because of the weather so I called 15min before my reservation time to let them know I'd be 15min late and they were fine with it. When I arrived I was told by the hostess that my table was being checked up on. I noticed they were setting up tables by the back doors. I had asked them about the private room and was told that it's been used by another group 30min ago. Now by this time it was 10pm. We waited 15min for them to set up a table that wasn't ours. They recalled no note on my account about the private room and disregarded the fact that I had made the reservation in advanced BEFORE the other group. All they did was semi-apologize and said they couldn't do anything more. My friends and I were hungry so we just took it. They sat us by the back door and next to the windows. Cold air was coming through the windows behind us and the wall seats..this night was -25 degrees. We were cold for the 5min we've been sitting down for. So we addressed our concern to our waitress which she was very accommodating and was able to move us next to the fire place. I was starting to feel upset at this point because the night did not start off well. When we moved, our new waitress was not helpful at all. She did ask us a few times if we wanted any alcohol beverages (probably to make more money for the company -smart) but later on, she never asked us if we wanted more water or even the simplest customer service question, \"how's everything going here?\" She never once checked up on us, the only time she came by was when we asked other waitresses for drinks. We got a few round of shots but no lemons. We asked for it and of course they didn't have any limes OR lemons. But yet we got a mixed drink with a lime wedge. So my friend got up and went to the appetizer bar and got lemons. Thanks. I was starting to get extremely annoyed about the lack of service because no one was enjoying their time including me. 

We weren't a difficult group but expected more. The food was fine, all the meat tasted the same, guess they spiced it that way but the lack of basic customer service ruined the vibe of the night. We were willing to pay good money to have a good time in what was suppose to be a \"good\" restaurant. This was my first time here and my party as well but it will be my last. Copacabana is a better experience for a Brazilian steakhouse."}
{"text":"Husband and I ordered their \"rodizio\" on a Monday night. ..in essence their description for an all-you-can-eat. We had been wanting to try the restaurant for a while and were very optimistic as my husband is definitely a meat eater. We've dined in other Brazilian and Argentina grills (outside Canada) before and really enjoyed them and hoped to recreate this back home.  Unfortunately that wasnt the case. This restaurant may be right for you if you prefer your meat medium-well or well done.  However if you are a rare or medium-rare person, like my husband,  you will find everything overcooked. I prefer my meat medium and i can live with medium-well so I was ok. Beef and bacon wrapped chicken were the best. Sausage was terribly overcooked and inedible.  Lamb also very overcooked and chicken wings were just plain not good. The salad bar was not bad but one of my pet peeves is any salad bar or buffet where the platters are filled with very little food. I always feel like I am choosing from picked-over food. This was the case here -- the plates holding the salad bar food were on the smaller side and were only half full. Sadly it was a turn-off for me. Service was good. Won't be back I'm afraid."}
{"text":"I love it. Just when you get in, the ambiance is great, nice simple background music, good decorations, server was amazing. My glass never empty. And the food is amazingly good, various choice of wine, and the price ?? I think it's worth it"}
{"text":"Really good. No need to visit Copacabana or Red Violin anymore. Only thing it was missing - farofa!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place I would go to again! I went their for a little get together with some friends for all you can eat meat but didn't realized we needed a reservation for that; instead we decided to sit in and the menu was impeccable! Their table appetizer was a sort of bread with cheese base and it was amazing! Food was great; service was excellent! The venue was very nice had a very calming chatty and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Brazilian grill house, and I would describe it as mediocre. 

The interior is very warm and welcoming; high ceilings and a well planned colour scheme. Seating was comfortable, and the tables allowed enough room for each person to have two plates in front of them. 

The food I would describe as \"meh\". For the price I paid, the food quality was low. Majority of the meats were tasteless and dry. The kitchen was inconsistent in meat preparation, as one leg of lamb came out amazingly tender and the next one was dry and tough. 

Nothing too special about the grilled pineapple, but it's sweetness was a welcome break from all the bland meat. 

I gave all the items at the salad bar a try, and safe to say the only thing I enjoyed was the mixed veggies, although it's hard to mess up vegetables. The smoked salmon pasta was consumable, but other that that, nothing special. 

The plaza in east beaver creek has better food to offer for the price you're going to pay for this dinner at Touro."}
{"text":"Overall experience:  The service can be improved and the cuts of meat were not the best.  We had reservations but we we still wound up waiting for a while.  The decor was nice.

This was our first time and the server did not bother to ask if it was our first time and did not explain the system of the red and green.  Would've been nice to know.  The salad/appetizer bar was uninteresting and did not have much selection at all.  I took some of the meatballs, fish and mussels and they were OK.  But nothing else seemed appealing enough to try.  Although the meatballs were really really good.  The men with skewers came around with the meat sporadically and the first one that came started slicing the meat and then said \"tongs\"  I had no idea what he was talking about since I was newbie.  He looked extremely annoyed and repeated \"tongs\" louder.   I heard him the first time I just didn't understand what he was talking about.  And he seemed even more annoyed that he had to explain it to me.  I'm sorry he wasted the extra 5 seconds of his life and that it was such a taxing experience to provide an explanation.  The chicken was very bland and some of the meats were good but some were really tough and salty.  Everything tasted the same after a while. The only standout was the pineapple.  I tried the cheesecake for dessert and that was tasty also.  But a good pineapple and dessert is not enough to lure me back especially since the star attraction needs work.  It was not cheap and at that price point there are other places I would rather go to."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Went here with the family and my 84 year old grandpa who doesn't eat much but he surprised us by eating his fair share. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Touro with a group of five. We had a reservation for 7pm which got us to our table on time. The ambiance is very nice, modern, and kind of upscale. The service from the hostesses was great, but the wine menu was a little complicated to operate and ordering drinks also seemed like a slow, complicated process for the waitress, since it was done on a tablet. 

I have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, so I have no point of comparison, but when the gauchos would come out with the meat, it seemed that they would all come out at the same time and then disappear for 15-20 minutes. The meat is tasty (and the grilled pineapple is a nice touch), but after the servers had disappeared for 20 minutes, and we asked the waitress where they were, they all came out again with very undercooked, inedible meat, which was disappointing. The timing here can definitely be improved.

One thing that was universally very disappointing was the side dish buffet. The salad bar was full of wilted salad greens and unappetizing toppings and dressings. The other side dishes included rice and beans which I am not a fan of, mediocre-looking soups and pasta salads, and very strangely, cooked salmon fillet, meatballs, and beef stroganoff. I'm not sure who would want any of these dishes as accompaniments to their grilled meats, but I think I went back to my table with a few pickled vegetables and some cheese, which was really disappointing. They would be better to axe the weird salmon, meatballs, and stroganoff, and replace the large array of unappealing pasta salads with more traditional BBQ accompaniments, like fresh french fries, creamy mashed potatoes, and a better, fresher salad mix.

The desserts also weren't bad. We had the cake pops and mini cupcakes. The presentation is cute, but the cake pops did not taste very fresh and were kind of hard. The mini cupcakes were, however, good. They also bring you a stick of cotton candy with your bill, which is a nice touch.

A nice experience, but overall, I would only recommend this place if the side-dishes were better. You will be taking a gamble on the timing and how the meat is cooked. Since the meat is pretty much the only thing worth coming here for, and since it winds up being quite pricey for just okay meat, I don't think I would choose to come back to Touro for dinner."}
{"text":"Very pleasant and friendly atmosphere with great service and ambience. Overall the food was good if I could say what needs improving it would be that the soup at the buffet for the appetizers was very salty and a lot of the food that was supposed to be warm was not. However overall the food was great especially the meat the best out of all the choices of course is probably the Parmesan sirloin and the grilled pineapple. The bacon wrapped chicken breast was also very good of course however a variety of the other meats are very fatty and not properly trimmed or cut. I could never see myself coming here more than once or twice a year to be honest however I would recommend it to anyone who's never been."}
{"text":"It is with mixed feelings that I write this review. I went for Rodizio on a weekend evening featuring the specialty of ribeye steak. Everything about the restaurant was great with fancy decor, very friendly service and a relaxing atmosphere. Yet overall, I LOATHED the experience.

It might be the fact that I might not like Rodizio as this was my first time. But after flipping my sign green (which means I am willing to accept meat) for 2 minutes, I had an overwhelming 8 cuts of meat on my plate. None of the servers understood the meaning of \"I just want a little bit\". When you say 'no' to a meat, they usually linger and try to change your mind. It felt like half the time I wanted a certain meat, I was haggling with servers and waiting for lady luck.

Also, the meat was dry. ALL CUTS  WERE DRY. I had asked for an assortment of sauces later on during the meal which made it bearable. The grilled pineapple was good.

Do not be fooled by the listed 40 appetizers (on their website), this includes their abundant selection of dressings at their salad bar so there are  only about a dozen or so choices of appetizers."}
{"text":"TIP: before you eat there walk to the buffet, look at the meats that are being served. It tastes exactly like it looks

Bland, rubbery, so incredibly disappointed and was pricey too. NOTHING tasted good there. Not one thing. 

The buffet looked like someone just went to a grocery store and grabbed overly microwaved food. I cannot express how disappointed I was.

{"text":"Took my wife out last night to this delicious resto!  Wow!!!! I have never seen so much meat in my life! Big variety of meat and buffet included. $50/person but it was worth it. They give you a red & green card and when you want more meat brought to you, you then flip it to the green card and they are quickly right by your side serving you more! If you flip the red card, it means you are still eating and do not want more meat at that time. Delicious chicken, pork, beef, steak & lamb. Buffet had salads, potatoes & so much more sides. If you need & love your protein this is the place to eat at. Nice restaurant & great atmosphere. My wife & I  will be back soon."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a Wednesday night, there were 6 of us.  We had reservations and were seated 10 minutes after we arrived. Our waitress was very nice, explained the process at this restaurant and went off to get us the appetizer platter. When the platter arrived there were 4 cheese ball breads and 4 pieces of the deep fried bananas. Waitress told us she would be back with more and didn't until 1/2 hour later. Buffet items were okay; salad, veggies, rice, pasta etc. the best part of the meal was the grilled meat. All very flavourful and cooked fresh. Beef was a bit tough. Chicken, ribs and sausage all good.  Grilled pineapple delicious. Meat servers were excellent, very attentive and polite. Prices here are steep, more so on the weekends. A coors light beer was 8$ and they do not offer a Seniors discount ( 2 people in our party were seniors)."}
{"text":"I've had dinner here 3 times so far, and they have downsized the salad bar selection since the first time I visited. 

My last visit was last weekend (June 2015), and they don't have salami or prosciutto anymore. :(

I saw a yelp picture that depicted salmon too, but there wasn't any when I went. The only seafood at the bar was mussels, which were good (flavourful, a little bit on the salty side). 

The served meat is still juicy and tasty, but one thing that bothered me was when I requested rare meat, and was given pieces that were mostly medium and well-done instead. After requesting rare meat and turning down well-done meat a few times, a server actually acted on the request and brought back one type of meat at rare doneness - only once though.  

In short, expect all meats to be medium or well-done. 


Lastly, for a $50 AYCE, I wish desserts were included. The pineapple is good, but it's almost an insult to pay an additional $10+ for a piece of cake. How about a self-serve ice cream bar? Too tacky?

{"text":"You work hard for your money. The food is mediocre but the service is appalling. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!

The restaurant decor is very nice but that's where it ends. The salad bar/buffet area has a very limited selection with several salad dressings that aren't labelled. The meat itself was mediocre, when we managed to get served. We were seated at the far end of the restaurant so by the time the skewers came to our table there wasn't always enough for everyone. Half the time they did come to the table, they would serve half the table and walk away despite other people in our party having their \"keep it coming tag\" with the green side up. That said, this wasn't enough to motivate me to write this review. After all it's not always about the food but rather the people your with and the experience. It's what happens next that is unacceptable. We were asked if we wanted dessert. We all passed. We were not asked if we wanted coffee or tea and before we could ask for ourselves the bill was on the table. We were a party of six. The bill came to $330 (without alcoholic drinks). While trying to finish up a conversation, we were being rushed to pay the bill. We paid our tab and continued our conversation. As we were wrapping up the manager and four servers swarmed us and started clearing our table. As one of our guests put her glass down from taking a drink, one of the servers grabbed the half full glass from right out in front of her. Then the manager started making comments. His first unapologetic comment to us was \"excuse us, we need to get this table cleared for the next service\". His next comment to the servers, while hovering over us, was \"go get the place settings to setup the table of ten\". He might as well have said, get the f@&k out of here. Some people don't belong in the hospitality industry. This guy is definitely one of them. Their website states that there \"may\" be a 2 hour seating limit. However, we not advised when we were seated. It was pretty much 2 hours to the minute when we were \"kicked\" out. I could understand if there were other parties waiting but the restaurant was not at capacity and there were NO large groups waiting to be seated. In fact, the bar had barley an patrons and lobby was dead. Bottom line is that their is a professional and unprofessional way to handle the situation. Clearly the manager lacked these skills. One of our guests stayed back after we left and confronted the manager. While he seemed apologetic, what he did was clearly orchestrated. We asked for and were given our tip back. We also asked to speak to the general manager. He said he would get the number and disappeared into the back. After waiting several minutes, he didn't return so we left. Just the value for the food alone was enough for me to never come back. Add in the appalling service and it's a guarantee I will never be back. I actually feel compelled to go out of my way to let others know. Do yourself a favor and go to The Keg next door for a quality cut of meat. If you want to pay $$$ for mediocre food with the added possibility of being disrespected and embarrassed by management, Touro is the place go."}
{"text":"We came here for our Christmas dinner. All the meat servers were pretty pissed off. The male host was a super douchebag and have no manners or any service skills at all. He basically bossed all his coworkers around him when clearly, he was the one thats confused. We walked in and waited about 7 mins before he finished ordering his coworkers around. Then he said 'wait a minute' without looking up and then looked at the table plans. We had a reservation for 8 people at 6pm on the 24th. There were no one else waiting for a table, and the place was pretty deserted at this time. The female hostess, on the other hand, knows what she's doing and was very curteous. 

The cheese bread, which was a cheese souffle, were amazing. The fried banana too. The salad bar had a huge variety. The meats that comes out where okay. Some of them were really over cooked and dried out. All the meats taste the same though cause they spiced it that way. Except for the lamb which actually taste like delicious lamb. The grilled pineapple which I heard much about was pretty sour... I ordered it 3 times at differenet intervals since it was a new one each time it came out, but they were all pretty sour. 

One of us is a vegetarian. The only vegeterian thing they have is the salad bar. I can't believe they charge people $24.75 plus tips and tax just to eat at the salad bar. It's a grill house after all, why not just grill some zuccunis, apples, or something. They charge ridiculous amount for someone to eat a cold meal. 

It was my first time in a Brazillian grill house. But it wasn't for four other people in our group. They all said Copacabana at Niagara was way better."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere - great for a first date - the food is really good, I really like the salad bar selection. The meat is quite tender and the servers are all very attentive."}
{"text":"I came last Wednesday night with a party of 2 and a half. Our experience here was pretty good from beginning to end. The hostesses were hospitable and friendly. We were taken to our seats by one of them, who then explained a bit of the background of the rodizio enthusiastically. Wasn't particularly interested in the history of it, but it wasn't too long. Our hostess grabbed a high chair for our little one and was very pleasant. 

The server, another young lady was friendly but she seemed a bit out of it, as she was probably busy with other customers. Service was running a bit slow, as it was hard to get a hold of the server. We asked the hostess to grab another set for the little one and for water, who promptly did as asked. She also helped us take a picture when she saw us struggling trying to take a family picture, very pleasant and friendly lady. She checked in on us once to see if we were enjoying our dinner. Our server did get more attentive a bit later into the night, and more friendlier. We did grow to like our server and we had a short and light conversation. She was also pleasant. It was understandable that she was busy with other tables to serve. 

The appetizer island did have a lot of food, but I did expect more dishes to be honest. The food was great, and the little appetizer plate that was brought out early in the dinner was really good as well. The meat was good, but nothing too amazing. Some of it was a bit dry. I did really enjoy the pork sausage surprisingly, and the lamb. 

Overall, the food was decent, although it could've been better for the high price that we paid. Service was great, and the hostess really helped make the night. Our server was a bit busy in the beginning, but grew more attentive later in the meal. Staff was polite and courteous. I would come back again for special occasions, as it is a fancy place."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday at this fine establishment.  Very classy place.  Place has a gorgeous bar and lounge area with wine sampling available.  Although a little pricey, the sampling adds a nice touch for early arrivers to relax a bit and mingle.

They have a good selection of buffet and fruits seem fresh.  The server came around frequent so you are rarely waiting for food.  A wide variety of meat so try to taste everything before going for second. Remember to end your meal with their grilled pineapple and cotton candy!"}
{"text":"We went for me sisters birthday we were a party of 5. This is a good Brazilian steakhouse. You have you ask them if you want the meat rare. They are happy to accommodate. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to go for dinner and drinks.  It has a lovely ambiant atmosphere, the serving staff is excellent.  Wild Game night is a is a real treat if you want to try something different.  The noise level is some what moderate, but not to the point where you can't hear your neighbour talking to you.  It is definately a must try on your list of things to do!!!"}
{"text":"OMG the meat here is dry and the salad bar sucks. The only good thing was the decor and fried banana. The cost is over-priced for what you get (Copa cabana is cheaper and tastier) plus they add an 18% gratuity for larger parties and the service is mediocre. DO NOT go here. You will be disappointed :("}
{"text":"Touro is a Brazilian steakhouse in the eatery central of Richmond Hill, East Beaver Creek. They have all you can eat meat just like Copacabana. 

Touro is very simply, a high end restaurant, where you get high quality food for a high price. Is it justified? That's for you to choose but I would say no. If you're going to come and want to save money, please don't come during prime time (Fri-Sun, dinner). Our bill of 2 came up to $150. 

Service was great, the \"meat handlers\" (sorry I don't know what you call them) would come very often and offer you the meat/pineapple and cut a piece(s) for you. We really enjoyed the bacon wrapped meats.

The salad bar was also great with different types of salads, pastas, fruits, cheeses, etc. 

If you want something extravagant for one meal and haven't tried a place like this, by all means go for it. Just don't be surprised by the bill!"}
{"text":"OK, I will say right up-front that I love this place. The food is fantastic and the embience is very nice. 

I have been to many Brazilian Churrascarias over the years and Touro ranms right up there with the best. The only reason for the four-stars and not five is the skimpy salad bar. The salad bar is sparse and not very apetizing. Although I am going there for the meat and not for the salads, it is still nice to have a lavish salad bar that is common in Brazilian and U.S. Churrascarias. 

As we sat down I immediately flip the card to green and the meat starts coming. Chicken drmsticks first, delicious; sausages next, delicious; and all the usual cuts of meat follow. Within 30 minutes I can hardly breathe but I want to eat more.

Another poitive here was the friendly staff and very clean restaurant. Also, unlike many places in Canada there was no live band. At least there wasn't when we were there. I do not like live bands when I am going to a restaurant to eat. I don't know why but in Toronto, at least, all the Brazilian BBQ places feel they have to give us cheesy live music. 

I will return over and over again to Touro. It's a great restaurant and I'm happy it is nearby in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentines Day and it had a romantic atmosphere.  Skewers of meat are brought to your table; we enjoyed the garlic steak and chicken wings the most.  Side table has veggies and pasta buffet. Our server was not the most genuine, but all the other staff were great."}
{"text":"Just arrived from our first (of many, we hope) visit to Touro. 3 adults and 2 children. 

Being a Brazilian-Canadian residing in Markham - therefore a fan of churrasco but not of driving downtown or to Niagara - I was really looking forward to Touro and the first initial visit met my expectations almost perfectly. This would be a 4.5 star review if we could rate it as such.

I nibbled a bit on stuff from the salad bar but concentrated my attention on the meats. There was a pretty good selection - rump steak, sirloin, chicken, etc... - and the staff was very prompt and courteous with bringing additional cuts cooked to our liking (rare, medium, medium-well or well done) or checking service levels. Some cuts could use a little bit more salt, but I understand my palate is a bit different than most of the clientele and they were very accommodating bringing extra salt as needed.

We did not try the wine bar but did try a caipirinha - it was pretty good but would probably benefit from just a bit more sugar. Otherwise it was soft drinks (refills) or juice for the kids. Would have loved if they had Coke Zero in addition to Diet Coke, but alas it was not to be. I forgot to inquire if they have guarana.

The desert portion was the slight letdown - selection did not seem that plentiful, there was no papaya cream (a traditional option in most Brazilian BBQs) and the passion fruit mousse was good but a bit too fancy (mixed with some *berry cream/sauce). I did not have coffee but it seemed OK for those in my group that did.

The ambience was very nice, high ceilings, fancy but tasteful decoration, cool temperature. We saw a good mix of clientele, including a few families with children. If one is planning to take kids there, I suggest the earlier timeframe (5:30-8:00pm) as I imagine the focus is more on grownups later in the evening.

The staff was very attentive and, as is expected of a new venture, were very interested in our opinions/impressions. Many (all?) of the meat servers are native Brazilians, as are some of the other staff. 

All in all, a *really* good experience, keeping in mind it is not a cheap option. I really hope business takes off and me and my family can become regulars there.

In summary: excellent experience, started off on right track, please add papaya cream(!) and keep improving!

Now I just need a few days to recover before I can visit again... :-)"}
{"text":"Rude rude rude new owner or whoever the guy was who was walking around like he owns this place. We had a birthday party, there was 10 of us plus 3 kids. One of the kids was a toddler and yes she might have been a little loud, the kids weren't bugging anyone or being annoying, they were all at our table. Anyway the guy who I think was the owner walks over and with the rudest attitude basicly tells us to be quiet because we are disruptive. This came as a shock to me as we are all well manered people and were in no way disruptive. Clearly, he could have asked in a way better manner to keep it a little more quiet. I found his tone and attitude very rude and we were a regular customers as we liked the food at this place. But we won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Went here with some coworkers on a Thursday around 12:45pm. We were seated right away and our server took our drink orders right away, the meat was really good this day, sometimes the chicken can be over cooked and dry, but today everything was on point. The chicken was juicy, the steak was delicious, and that parmesan cheese bread so good! The only bad thing and hence my 3 star rating was we had three rounds of drinks, and each time the servers took longer and longer to bring us our drinks, the last round took almost 30 mins to bring us 4 Long Island ice teas. But everyone is really nice."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with a party of 10.  Service was fantastic and so was the food.  Everything came out hot, tasting delicious.  As for some Brazilian steak houses they over salt and over season the food.  This was not the case.  Only negative comment was some of the garlic dishes were overpowering with too much garlic.  They do a great job of serving and the staff were friendly and very helpful.  Great starter salad and app bar as there were lots to choose from and always being replenished.  Overall experience is we are coming back.  Make sure you come hungry."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Touro to celebrate our 5th anniversary.  We had made a 7:15 reservation on a Saturday night, but we arrived around 6pm so that we could have a nice bottle of wine and check out the wine bar/lounge area prior to dinner. 

The decor is really amazing.  Chic and modern, yet still warm and inviting.  The esthetic is consistently warm and welcoming from the entrance through to the bar area, wine bar/lounge, dining room and patio bar area...we visited them all.  There is also a large private room that would be a great space for a party.

Seeing as my lovely girlfriend wanted to pick up the bill, I thought it would be nice to start out with a 2009 Cakebread Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon...and boy, was I right...it was fantastic.  It was also $168, so I knew there would be some expectations at the end of the night!   

Upon being seated at our table, and knowing the meal that stood between us and those expectatons, I decided that I'd skip the appetizer island/salad bar and stick mainly to the Rodizio offerings.

Our server, Marta, came by, introduced herself, and made sure that we had everything that we needed.  She explained what the three sauces on the table were, as well as what the four starter apps on the table were as well.  We ordered a bottle of sparkling water, and were prepared to start receiving the meat offerings from the numerous Gauchos flying through the dining room.  At this point, a couple of complimentary drinks arrived, and I thoroughly enjoyed both of them!

Upon reading some other reviews, I was concerned that we were going to be offered the same 3 meats all evening, but that certainly wasn't the case.  I would say that there was a rotation of 8-10 meats offered, and lets just say that my plate was never empty.  All of the meats were well seasoned, and cooked pefectly, with an offering that allowed you to have anything from rare - medium...neither of us would choose anything medium or above...we're savages like that!  I should take a moment to add that the pineapple is incredible.  It's seasoned with cinnamon and something else that is incredibly delicious...I couldn't put my finger on it, so I just assumed it could only be the tears of children.

Once we were bested by the meat offerings, we thought it would be a good idea to order another bottle of wine, and head out to the patio to enjoy it.  The patio area has a bar, a dining area, additional seating, as well as a comfortable lounge area.  Upon sitting at our chosen spot, a couple of complimentary shots arrived, they were lovely, and then we proceeded back to the wine.  

Collectively, we decided to skip desert and have coffee and a couple of additional drinks.  We also decided that we wouldn't be driving home, so at this point, we also ordered a service to drive us home in my car (thanks Keys to Us)...safety first!  I had a double espresso and a grappa, my super-sexy girlfriend had a cappuccino.  We had found our romantic oasis, and the conversation and company was beyond belief...that didn't have anything to do with the restaurant, but it's important to convey the direction in which this night was headed!

As I had mentioned earlier, our server Marta was excellent!  Personable, attentive and not at all overbearing.  She recognized that we were in no rush at all, and ensured that we had everything we needed.  The manager, Michael, came by to ensure that everything was to our satisfaction, we had a great conversation, and he sent me another drink, which was not only fantastic, but also ensured I made the right choice in ordering a car service.

All in all, we were at Touro for 6 hours.  Our bill was $480 all in, a good portion of which was the wine...and it was worth every penny.   The decor, the food, the service and most importantly, the company made this a night to remember.  The manager, our server Marta, and the bar staff went out of their way to ensure we had a great night.  We will certainly be going back.  

As for the end of the night once we got dropped off?  You'll have to look for my girlfriend's Yelp review of me!

Some side notes:
- The restaurant has a clearly stated dress code...apparently a lot of people don't know what that means.
- Upon arrival, there is complimentary valet parking,  which is a great idea as this area tends to get very busy on the weekends.
- Kids...maybe you shouldn't bring them.  Just a thought."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite Brazilian steakhouse. This is my first pick whenever I feel like eating a lot of steak and meats. They have a good selection of cuts for steak, and their cinnamon and honey pineapple is to die for ! 

I've come here on the weekends and the weekdays and I much prefer the selections at the Appetizer Island on the weekends! Be sure to come hungry! 

I would recommend saving your stomach the room for the steak and shy away from their chicken and sausage selections. I find their chicken to be very dry and they give you if not a full sausage, then at least half of it - and that can be realllllyyy filling. 

Unlimited cheese bread and fried banana! I LOVE the cheese bread ! It's a chewy texture and airy and puff-like ball of light bread.

Parking is the hardest thing to get. There are so many restaurants in one area that share the same parking lot, you literally have to make a few circles and wait until parking becomes available if you go during dinner time. I put up with waiting for parking just because the Brazilian steakhouse and their pineapple is really THAT bomb."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever going to a Brazilian steak house, and Touro has really lived up to my expectations!!

Went here for my boyfriend's birthday with a group of friends, and the food was absolutely delicious!

Like any other Brazilian steakhouse, the waiters/waitresses come up to your table with their food offerings on a metal rod and ask if you want any. 

What i thoroughly enjoyed though, was this little coaster looking thing that you can flip with a green sticker, meaning you are taking food, or a red sticker which means you're still working on your plate!

You also go up to a buffet style table to pick up your sides, from salads to mashed potatoes and even fruit!

I highly suggest the grilled pineapple. Holy hell the pineapple was amazing!

I find the dress code a little misleading though. It says to pretty much dress fancy ... But we were the most over dressed table in the whole place. While people around us were in jeans and sweats. We stood out like a sore thumb.

The staff were super professional, and extremely friendly!! As a birthday thing, they came out with a mini cupcake with a sparkler in the middle of it singing happy birthday! Had a great experience here!"}
{"text":"Awful awful service. Despite having a third of the place with empty tables, and our group having a reservation, they made everyone wait over an hour.  The food was ok, but the people are rude and slow. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I decided to take my boyfriend to Touro for his birthday seeing as it was an all you can eat steakhouse. I made reservations a few days before and Touro seemed extremely accommodating. The day before the reservation, I called into the restaurant to ask them about an online gift card that they seemed to be promoting, as when I clicked into the gift card it directed me back to their website. The gift card was for $20, and before the reservation I called in ahead of time to ask if it was still valid, the person I spoke to on the phone went and asked management, and they came back to confirm that it was, also noting it on my reservation. As we finish our meals and the bill comes, our waiter surprisingly told us that the manager could not give us that $20 gift card as we didn't have a code. I showed the waiter the picture of the coupon and told him that I called the day before to confirm. He even agreed and told me that there was a note on my reservation that it was valid, however, the manager stated that we weren't able to redeem the gift card. Extremely poor management, and after this ridiculous incident, I will never go back to this restaurant. It was a total scam, having three different people confirm that the gift card was valid, but when the bill came it was denied. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I came here despite what the review says.
Here are the goods: good service, good atmosphere

Here are the bad: THE MEAT, the meat taste like it was in the fridge for months and all the meats are over cooked. There are no Brazilian cuts of meats at all for Brazilian steak house. After rounds of disappointing meat that taste like tenderizer and salt our party decides to leave and continue our dinner else where."}
{"text":"Amazing place! I love their wine arrangement. You can try different types of wine. They have a big selection. The decor is original  and modern. 
Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food could be better, the chicken was really plain and dry, the sauces were really salty, and ribs weren't good. Beef, sirloin and pineapple were excellent. Good wine menu and the patio was really nice"}
{"text":"Ever been so excited to go try something for the first time? I Skipped lunch, had a coffee instead, met my in laws at the resto.....took my seat and dove in.

FML was I ever let down. 

They had already visited the appetizer buffet and meat had begun being served at the table. The meats were decent at best, most over cooked and over seasoned. The selection of meats, a few kinds of steak, beef and pork ribs, bacon wrapped chicken and leg of lamb. None of it was as good as the other places that serve Brazilian bbq. 

I went to the appetizer buffet and what I found was gross. The prepared salads were all lacking flavour and the textures were horrible. The tortilla chips were being refilled out of a clear plastic garbage bag with bare hands. I decided to make myself a caesar salad.  The romaine lettuce was floating in a swimming pool of water, the Parmesan cheese had the outer shell of the wheel ground up into it. The croutons were full of the dust you find at the bottom of the bag when you bring them home from the grocery store.

I returned to the table and we continued our meal. But I was disgusted by what I had seen. Needless to say I could not enjoy the rest of the meal. Had my in laws not been there I would have left with my wife. 

I spoke to the manager Richard, even walked him to the buffet and showed him in detail everything you have just read. He introduced me to another manager, the second manager asked if I was a chef, I told him I wasn't and he scoffed at me and walked away. WTF? 

Richard actually took interest in what I had to say and I believe was sincere in taking the criticism I had, for this I commend him. Will it be enough to make us return? Not a chance in hell.  

The only thing they got right was the the pineapple. It was fresh, flavourful and tasty.

$300 for dinner for 6, do yourself the favour stay away. 

There are 4 other Brazilian BBQ joints I know of and have been to. Copacobana at Yonge and Eglinton and in Niagara Falls, Braza in Niagara Falls and the Red Violin on the Danforth.  All of them are better than this place by a long shot, go to one of them. Or save the money, go to Chakko, for Korean BBQ in the same complex, it's not as fancy and you have to cook your own food, but you will leave happy and full and not like you just got screwed out of $300!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of meat everything, this is the place for you but be sure to come hungry. 

The restaurant itself is beautiful and very chic. Our waitress was a little on the snobby side but the people coming around with different cuts of meat were great. They have a large selection of appetizers, buffet style at the front and all quite delicious. The meats itself were a hit or miss, some were quite chewy, other were oozing of blood (which I don't mind but your plate looks like bloody murder after) while others were incredibly tender and juicy. The pineapple... was so good. We just made the guy stand there until he cleared his supply then asked him to come back. He was a good sport about it though.

We ordered a pitcher of mojito which we didn't think was worth it in the end, not flavoured enough or strong enough but now we know. The price tag for dinner on a Wednesday night was hefty ~$50pp. I personally would not come back unless I had to because honestly, I can't eat $50 worth of meat."}
{"text":"I'm very mixed about this place... I came here with my family for my brother's birthday.
I liked the Brazilian cheese bread a lot and the mashed potatoes were amongst the best I've ever had in my life. But everything else was mediocre.
The appetizer and sides bar was lacking in selection and was not refilled enough. When the romaine, mixed greens, AND spinach salad bowls are all empty that's saying something. The other items were just mediocre. There was a also a sweet and sour chicken dish there that didn't belong (bc cmon, there is so much other brazilian  food to be had although i know it is markham). 
Now on to the meat commentary. . It was just 'ok'. Most of the beef was cooked to a medium-medium well which was too cooked for my liking. The bacon wrapped chicken was overcooked. Short ribs were tough. I'm not a big meat eater but when I do eat meat, it better be darn good. Best meat was the lamb leg bc it was oh so juicy and the skin was crispy!
Desserts also not included in the 39.95 for dinner (weekday) which is very upsetting for the price. 
Our waitress was also nowhere to be seen all night and it was hard pressed to get our plates cleared and water glasses filled.
Decor is beautiful and modern.
I would give it a 2.5 since its a bit sad when the best dish at a churrascaria is mashed potatoes but since my brother had a blast, solid 3/5."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday. It wasn't that busy so the meat came out really fast, faster than i can finish. Some meat were flavourful, some didn't have enough flavours. I am quite petite, so I would not be able to eat that much meat. I only was able to take a bite out of each type. The pineapple was sweet and good! For the price, I probably wouldn't come back. I would rather spend the money on Kbbq"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very open, especially for a group setting, lighting is perfect for seeing whomever you are with and for appreciating the cuts of meats you are about to be graced with. There are corner tables for a little bit more of a personable/intimate ambiance, you just have to ask. The selection of meats, namely during \"Game\" season, you need to contact the restaurant as to when exactly they are offered, are probably some of the best and prepared I have ever experienced! They were all cooked properly and not a one was dry. The wine selection is also something to behold, thanks Kris, especially if you wish to broaden your palate to several types of complementing \"Vino's\", whether you wish a sample, a cleansing of the palate or a full glass to accompany your meal, it's completely up to you. Their staff is very consistant with their concern of your well being of comfort, satisfaction wise, atleast it was that for me! Prices were reasonable and fair, I/we plan to come back and will recommend this place to others because our eyes have been opened to an evening that the Keg could not hold a candle to! Please check this place out!"}
{"text":"So i think this is a little overhyped. Its essentially a fancier, more modern buffet. Definitely try it once on a special occasion but I personally would not decide to come back, I am satisfied with my experience.

The meat is pretty good, not amazing, but pretty good. Definitely try the pineapple when it comes around and the garlic pork thing. Actually get a little everything because everyone has different tastes, but only get a little to TRY and then get seconds on your favourites. 

I regret getting so much from the buffet since most of the cost comes from the meat. So my advice for that is to use the buffet as a small relief from eating so much meat. Get a bit of salad, or half a bowl of soup. Just don't make that your meal. The meat is the meal.

Last thing is venue or overall aura: very nice, modern, professional. Worthy of facebook bragging."}
{"text":"Family dinner celebration here last night - Dad's pick after sharing many stories of his travels to Brazil many years ago. 

We arrived at 5 pm, and though the restaurant was not full (as expected, but we eat early!), we got a table (though were advised to make a reservation - with 2 hour seatings, we'll do that next time for sure!). Happy to get a great table, our friendly waiter explained how things work - salad/apps and side buffet, and the go/stop cards for the meat. SO MUCH STEAK! Needless to say, I was a happy camper. I loved the thin steak best, though the filet with bacon (of course) and garlic steak (SO garlicky, but that just makes its better) were also hits. The grilled pineapple recommended by others is excellent, with cinnamon. If there's something you're waiting for, we mentioned it to one of the servers and they sent them our way (filet with bacon... again please!). They kept a good pace with servings, and were friendly. The cheesy bread and fried bananas were a nice way to end the meal. Oh, they just got a new wine list on an iPad, and though ours had some technical glitches, we were pleased with a bottle of white ($38, not bad). While not a cheap night out ($45/person), it was the perfect thing for a celebration. The decor is super nice, not stuffy but modern and stylish. They also have a patio, though we didn't try it (yet!)."}
{"text":"Almost two years ago the concept for Touro came into being. Bring a high end Brazilian Steakhouse to the GTA as an alternative to the long standing Toronto/Niagara options. 

I had the pleasure of taking a tour of Touro months before opening and even in a mid-construction phase, I could tell that they had something unique and different to offer the people of the GTA. 

First and foremost this opulent creation is the work of design mastermind Glen Peloso. Walking in you see every detail has been thought of, the genius and attention to detail inside is unmatched in any restaurant I've ever seen. From a live tree in the dining room, to tall glass doors when you enter, vaulted ceilings, and some of the most intricate light fixtures around Sir Peloso has thought of everything! 

But that's not all, Touros patio... Lets just call it as it is, the biggest in York Region at 3000sq feet! But what a patio, complete with artificial turf, waterfalls, private bottle service cabana and a fire pit - yes a fire pit!

Hmm, am I missing anything before I talk about the delicious, mouthwatering food? Oh ya! Aside for the psychedelic bar serving a mix of unique contemporary cocktails and Brazilian classics, Touro is the ONLY self service bar in Ontario! But Kris, what does that mean? Well allow me to educate you my libatious friend. At any time when visiting Touro you can request a special Wine Card which you can preload with money. That card can the be inserted into one of many wine dispensers and you can choose from a taste to a full pour glass of any wine. This allows you to try high end bottles at just a taste without breaking the bank. 

Ok so enough about the frills, what about the food? The REAL reason you visit Touro!  Well they have more cuts of meat than you could imagine eating in a single seating whether you're dining at lunch or dinner. Recently I took full advantage of their lunch special where for $24.95 you get to dine on 8 cuts of meat. For dinner the price increases to approximately $39 and the meat prospects grow to 15-16! All meat is cooked on traditional Brazilian rotisserie grills, and speaking from multiple personal experiences, it's cooked to perfection by the masterful kitchen staff! My personal fave is the Top sirloin and the pork sausage. Must tries when you visit. 

From a personal point, I must compliment them on hiring quite possible the BEST looking wait staff in the GTA. But not your typical Jack Astor or Hooters girls. These are the elegant natural beauties that you'd be proud to bring home to your picky European mother. Gorgeous all around (and super smart too, able to make informed recommendations with no hesitation). 

In summary, Touro is the type of venue that brings together good food, sophistication, fair prices and a unique experience for guests of all ages and backgrounds. 

Muito Obrigado Touro!"}
{"text":"Ok where to start! Stumbled upon this restaurant as I was in the area for work with a colleague.  It's huge with over the top decor. It's more like a venue than a restaurant! We sat outside for lunch in the patio and it was gorgeous. Much smaller and more intimate.

This is a rodizio restaurant, but we didn't think that would be appropriate for a working lunch! They do have a substantial a la carte menu that's not online. I got what was essentially a fancy hotdog and it was delicious! I had a drink with lychees in it (forget the name, but it was good). Service was super friendly. We kept looking over to the people who were doing the rodizio. So I am definitely coming back soon for the rodizio experience!"}
{"text":"We went to Touro with our two kids and we enjoyed it very much. The service is great and the food is amazing! I personally really liked the beef ribs and top sirlone, I definetely recommend trying it. When you first get to the restaurant, you are seated and then you are able to go to the appetizers buffet; they have soups, salads, freshly cut meat, and more. Then waiters come around every five minutes with different meats. You get a coaster that has one green side and one red side. If you want more meat, you flip the green side up. If you were full and didnt want more meat, you flipped the red side up. I definately reccommend this restaurant; the food is really good and the service is great, the interior is nice and on warm days you can eat outside."}
{"text":"My favourite: steak and pineapple. Cooked very well. Although it was very salty at one point. All other meats were delish, but I was there for steak. I was also surprised at how good the pineapple was. My friends and I were practically hounding down our servers for more pineapple. I also loved the salad bar. But of course I tried to stay in my seat more often. 

Even though we reserved, there was still a wait. The cost is high but for the experience, its OK. Did I also forget to mention that the decor is 10/10?"}
{"text":"All you can eat 5/5 yelps
quality food 4/5 yelp
service 4/5 yelp we had a larger party of 20
salad bar 3/5 yelp who needs a salad when you have all you can eat meat.
parking 0/5 yelp it's horrible 
Standard cost $43 per person on Mon.-Thurs.more on weekend.
I always have a difficult time justifying the cost and value of the meal.
It was a company function so who am I to say no."}
{"text":"We were waiting in line at the Keg for an hour and realized that this place serves all you can eat steaks at almost the same price. 

The first steak I tried is the flank steak...f?!$\"  crazy flavour, next was the picanha.................May the Keg rest in peace!"}
{"text":"Usually the service is excellent but for some reason the last visit had no wait staff visit us for almost 15 min after being seated. We decided just to get up and start the salad buffet. Finished salad and still no wait staff. I'm pretty sure we could of eaten and walk out without paying since there was nobody attending to us. We finally flagged a waitress and she saved the afternoon. She was surprised nobody came and I'm sure our table wasn't her responsibility.  If the owner is reading this give Stephanie a raise as she attended to us above and beyond. Thank her for the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Good choice if you are a meat lover... I would recommend to try the steak from the dinner menu and not the all you can eat menu. Good atmosphere & service for large groups, was there for my bday. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came to Touro for the first time last weekend and had a good experience. My friends and I were seated at a table in the middle of a row with three sets of tables. 

When you first sit down you are told to go up and grab food/sides from the buffet tables. We went up to get our starters and I asked a waiter what food items I could eat since I am both lactose and gluten intolerant. The waiter called the chef who walked me through the entire buffet. To my surprise, there were lots of side dishes I could enjoy. One such dish was a Brazilian dish called, Farofa. I had never had this before and it looks like a grain but it is made with a wheat free product. It was really good and I will definitely try making it in the future at home.

When we flipped our cards to the green side to request meat, I felt like we were skipped over by the employees serving the meat. They kept approaching the tables on the end of our row and kept forgetting to visit our table in the middle of the row. I was late to join my friends (parking in this plaza is a nightmare on the weekend) and my friends had already started eating when I arrived and I was getting frustrated by the employees as they continued to overlook our table. I even tried flagging some of them down and it took about 30 minutes for some of them to notice us. I even asked our waitress to send them to our table and she wasn't successful at getting them to visit us.

With the above being said, the food was really good. The meats were scrumptious and I really enjoyed the Picanha steak. It tasted sweet and spicy. The seasoning was perfect and the steak was tender. However, I was disappointed that I didn't get to try all of the meats because the servers in the restaurant kept overlooking.  Considering I paid $70 fir my meal, I would have liked to try all of the meats. 

When it became time for dessert I was in heaven. One of my favourite desserts and digestive aid is pineapple. The employees walk around serving you grilled pineapple coated in brown sugar and cinnamon. It is to die for and something that made the entire meal come together nicely. 

During the weekend, Touro puts on a show and the show was okay. Once again, we were sitting too far away from it and they engaged with people sitting on the end tables and we were in the middle.

Allover it was a nice experience but I'm not sure I would go back on a weekend. I would possibly go back on a week night when it is less busy and only if we could get a table at either end of the row"}
{"text":"We got the private dining room and the whole experience was amazing from start to finish!

The service with the meats was impeccable and the system that they have with the coasters is amazing! At one point, we had too much service! First time I am saying that! All the meats were on point and my personal favorite was the Parmesan Pork! MAAAAAAAAAAAAN! So good!

PRO TIP: Don't fill up on the appetizers and make sure you get the green sauce (chimmichuri?) It pairs really well with  the meats! Loved it!"}
{"text":"All you can eat meat? It doesn't get much bette than that! The only reason you wouldn't love this idea is if you're a meat-hater! Booo! Lol. 

All jokes aside, this is one of the best places for anyone looking to eat their weight in high quality meat. From chicken to pork to beef! They have everything that you could possibly want! I will warn you now though, the price is definitely up there, as dinner on the weekends are about $45 per person! Yikes! If you can get passed that price, you're in for a great time! Note: there is a dress code as well, so you may wanna look into that before going.

As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by beautiful and friendly hostesses, that will quickly assign you a table. At your table, the servers will quickly explain to you what the medallions mean, and then the meat parade starts. These guys will come over with the meat, and basically give you as much as you want! Highlights for me are definitely the Chicken Wings, Top Sirloin, Lamb, and Bacon Wrapped Steak. Each one cooked to perfection and served piping hot! There is also a salad bar with soups, with an assortment of starters and appetizers. 

However, the best item on the menu is definitely the Grilled Pineapple. What, a fruit? Exactly! Its grilled pineapple thats seasoned with cinnamon until it caramelizes, and intensifies the sweetness! It's honestly heaven and you end up eating more and more of it, even when you're full!

Service was quite good, with food coming all the time, water being refilled often, and servers checking in on the table. Could be a bit smarter with the plates, as the ones that are already on the table are tiny and need exchanging rather consistently. Servers are quite good about changing the plates though.

With beautiful decor and ambiance, an awesome bar (including a DIY wine bar), this is the perfect place to eat, enjoy, and leave with a food baby!"}
{"text":"$26.99 for Sunday brunch is an amazing deal and everything was delicious! My favorite has always been the Picanha and the grilled pineapples. Take a bite into a slice of pineapple and it literally melts in your mouth into cinnamon-y, sweet and sour goodness. They also have a wide assortment of vegetables (not just salad) at the buffet bar and it nicely balances out the meal. Pancakes, pastries, bacon and other breakfast things were also available.
Service is pretty good. Waiters are very friendly and come by often. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and I really love the ambience."}
{"text":"So I'm a bit of a buffet freak.  I LOVE copacabana so it seemed obvious that I should come give this Brazilian steakhouse a try too.   I was with someone who only wanted to eat the veggie option, so my review will not be on the meat.  The restaurant itself is much nicer, quieter, and spacious than Copa.  So basically much better for a more intimate date night.  However, the food is not up to par.  The buffet area was seriously lacking.  A few salads, veggies, soup, and only like 4 hot dishes.  They had hummus with pita, and the pita was actually rock hard.  Nothing stood out in my mind except their roasted potatoes were really good. They also give you this puffy cheese bread which I do loveee and fried bananas.  Of course, the grilled pineapple is to die for.  

Even though I didn't eat the meat, I could see the tables in my area and the frequency they come out with it is LOW.  At copa I find that you are constantly eating and there is always someone coming around with meat.  Here, I see waiters come around every 10 minutes or so with one type of meat.  So this kinda made me happy that I opted for the veggie option.  I will not be coming back here.  Copacabana is 10000 times better than this place"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to a Brazilian steakhouse, so technically, I haven't been to a better one, but I have had better meals.

First of all, the good stuff. The place is absolutely beautiful. It's a great setting. we were able to secure the party room that comfortably seated our group of 18. Service - securing a reservation, the bar, the server, the gauchos, and everyone else - was excellent.

My main problem was that it was really pricey for the quality. The meat was fine, but nothing blew me away. Most of it was cooked more than I would have liked. The sides (at an AYCE counter) were mostly salad, cold cuts, cold veggies and oddly enough, beef stroganoff and meatballs. (Would you like some meat on the side of all your meat?) I was hoping for more interesting sides.

So all in all, everything about this place was completely en pointe except the food, but that's the main reason for going to a restaurant. I think the quality would have been acceptable at $30/pp rather than $45/pp, but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends, some of them first time at a Brazilian steakhouse. They were more than impressed with the food, decor and ambience. I thought the interior design was thoughtfully done with the right lighting. Our waitress was super friendly. Overall an awesome meal and I'd recommend"}
{"text":"Went here last night for the Rodizio menu for a Carnivorous evening with the Hubby. There was 14 cuts of meat plus the hot and cold table buffet.  Our first round was the bacon wrapped chicken with the pork sausages, the chicken was tender and flavorful due to the bacon fat that prevented it from drying it out. Secondly, came the beef ribs.  Now those were tasty and had just the right amount of bite without being too chewy.  Unfortunately, I could not say the same about the garlic steak. The meat was so tough and chewy.  Hurts your jaw from chewing so much.  The best is is definitely the BBQ pineapples!"}
{"text":"Where do I start?
 
Let's begin with the decor: 5/5 
From the moment I entered the restaurant, I was immediately impressed with the spacious layout and beautiful ambience. 

Service: 5/5
All of the wait staff were really attentive and most importantly they were friendly.

Food: 5/5
The meats were amazing! 
Tender, juicy and just the right amount of  fat: meat ratio; marinated to perfection.

Touro is definitely a winner!!"}
{"text":"There was an \"Appetizer Island\" in the middle of the restaurant where we were free to select from the hot and cold dishes a la buffet style.  When we were done selecting from the Appetizer Island, we could return to the table and show our \"Sim\" or \"Não\" signs in order to indicate to the Gauchos whether we wanted them to stop at our table to serve us meats or not.  I think this style of dining is so fun and interactive!

Once we got back to the table, I displayed the \"Sim\" card and the Gauchos approached us right away with cuts of meat.  The first one was the Pork Ribs which was very a very large piece and very tasty.  The meat on it was nicely seasoned and tasted good.

The Leg of Lamb was fairly good too and not too rough at all.

The Bacon-Wrapped Chicken Breast was surprisingly tender and moist.  It was quite good!

When it came to chicken, I liked the Chicken Legs more.  The meat was smooth and tender.  I did think it was a little over-salty though, even for my taste.

The Picanha (cut of beef called sirloin cap in the U.S. that is popular in Brazil and referred to as the rump cover, rump cap or coulotte) had a very crispy skin and the meat was firm.

The Parmesan Sirloin was very good and tasty!  I really enjoyed how it had crunchy Parmesan grilled on top of the moist sirloin.  The Garlic Steak was very moist and juicy although the garlic wasn't as strong as the Parmesan.

The Pork Sausage was just okay-tasting to me.

I found the Beef Short Ribs a bit rough to chew through.

Out of the 12 meats that night (plus two special ones), I didn't try the Flank Steak or Top Sirloin.  After a while, the abundant meats was really filling and I just couldn't eat too much anymore.

The Grilled Pineapple was everyone's favourite.  The Grilled Pineapple was actually out a lot and the gauchos didn't fail to bring it out constantly.  This was a larger piece than I had experienced before at the other Brazilian steakhouse and not as sweet.  Their Grilled Pineapple is covered with cinnamon and sugar before being grilled so the exterior is crispy with a cinnamon and sugar crust.

I found that all of the the portions here were larger than what I experienced at the other Brazilian steakhouse.  I preferred the smaller portions at the other restaurant since it meant you wouldn't be too full after just one round.  The grilled pineapple portions were smaller there too, which I enjoyed more.

Our server also gave us a portion of cheese bread at the beginning of the meal which I loved!  These little morsels of cheese bread were so gooey, chewy, and cheesy!"}
{"text":"I came here when they had the brunch selection for only $19.95 and it was so good and so worth it!
The servers came by so often and had a variety of meat selections (sausages, chicken, bacon, beef, grilled pineapples). They were all so juicy and tender...so delicious!

Plus, the breakfast buffet was amazing! They had fruits, veggies, eggs (they also make omelette for you), more breakfast sausages, salad...so many varieties to choose from. 

I'm not sure what the prices are now and how the service is, but having that as my first experience at Torro definitely made me want to come back. However, I think the prices have gone up since then, not sure by how much. 

I've only been to their brunch special so I can't really comment on their dinner menus, but I bet it's even better! I cannot wait to go back and try them again!"}
{"text":"This place is really just okay to me.  We went here for my BF's birthday.  The decor and ambience of this place is excellent.  The food was good only for the first few rounds...some of the meats were either too way too salty or blend.  No happy medium.  The best was the sirloin, a def must try.  

Prior to coming here, everyone raved about the grilled pineapple and so my BF and I were so excited to finally try it.  Maybe we have different tastes than others out there but the pineapple wasn't good.  It was way too sweet (sweetener with sugar) and the cinnamon on it didn't go too well for us.

For the price, I would rather spend my money on a steak house.  I would go back with friends who haven't tried it before only for the experience."}
{"text":"Came here for my Birthday on the 20th having seen that the place was open when I went to the Jack Astors a few weeks back to watch them get eliminated. I was planning on going to Copacabana, but decided to try this place out since it was so much closer to my home. 

Its strange how my family's experience with the food/meat at Touro differed so much. We actually greatly preferred the meat at Touro, feeling that it was very well seasoned, not nearly as deathly salty as it was at Copacabana. Ill agree with him though that there were a couple cuts that were a little overdone and a bit on the dry side (leg of lamb/lamb chops) but really everything else was amazing. Delicious, tender, well seasoned meat. Friendly staff that were willing to explain anything to you, whether it was the cocktail menu, wine menu, the food at the appetizer buffet, anything!

I had a capririnha, which I had never tried before and boy does this thing pack a punch haha.

The \"special\" appetizers that were brought to the table ahead of time were a little underwhelming but for us it was something different to try. We loved the fried banana.

The decor at this place was really nice, I loved the cool light fixtures they had, as well as the open view into the kitchen, we were able to see the meat getting grilled as the night went on!

My family definately wants to come back, and I know that me and my friends really want to come back sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"Meat lovers hut!!! 

First I must say,  I'm not a fan of meats, but I really wanted to try out the Brazilian grills.  

Went here with my family for a special occasion and got a bar table...  

Interior decor was simply stylish and trendy. 
Appetizers/Snack bar was self serve, but the refills was not frequent enough and there was few tiny flies because of the fruits and sour pickles.  

The grilled meats were awesome!  Fav was the Parmesan steak.  The continuous meat refills was a plus.  

Price wise was a bit too pricey for just repetitive meats and  a simple limited snack refill and salad bar."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went there on a Wednesday night, and it wasn't too busy. They charge extra on on the weekend when they offer an extra cut of meat, but we figured the weekday selection was more than enough for us.

Not happy with the service we received.  The waiter didn't bother telling us about the red/green coaster, and didn't even remember to give us one.  Also, we weren't made aware that the 3 appetizers they bring you upfront was also unlimited (We found out when another waiter told the table beside us).

For a meal this price, I would've expected better service."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times to see if the service has changed and really it hasn't. I was expecting that since I was paying that much, I should at least have a server who smiles. For some reason, other tables servers were all pleasant and smiling with them, making them feel special and happy to be there. Both times my husband and I went, we went for special occasions and both times we left feeling dissatisfied and disappointed. The service I think needs to be re-evaluated by management. Maybe they need more training or maybe they need people who can do the job and not show that they are unhappy working there. The only things that I was satisfied with was the decor, which is amazing and the food, which is pretty good. We pretty much decided that if we were to be coming back, it will be for someone else's occassion."}
{"text":"AMAAAAZING !!! Such good food. Has dinner and lunch. 25 for lunch very well price. Loved it ! I've been like 5 times. Unfortunately the service is NOT the best and some of them are super rude. But food is to die for, I made friends with one of the servers super nice and lovely !

- UPDATE -
So we've been about ...8 times now maybe 9 for lunch. And yesterday it must of been an off day... cold meats and pineapple was cold. So I ended up emailing Kelsey the manager. She told us to come back and lunch is on them. I was super happy because paying $55.95 +tip is a lot of money for lunch,( 2 ppl) so I was super impressed. I already said I love it but I love it even more now."}
{"text":"I'll make this short and simple. Yes, very nice atmosphere and pretty good service. Always fills you up with foods. Ayce. Price is on the high end. About $50 a person. But the food is a bit on the salty side.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Amazing ! We had an awesome night at Touro. The decor was beautiful and truly enjoyed the complimentary wine tasting event.

My personal favourite was the salad bar, it was fresh and tons of variety. My husband enjoyed the lamb and sirloin.

We will be back with our friends and family next time."}
{"text":"went here again for birthday and would have to upgrade my prev rating to 4.5 stars out of 5. Absolutely amazing service and food."}
{"text":"Spent New Year's Eve and will definitely do it again. Excellent service, phenomenal food, great show, and an excellent restaurant. 
Food is amazing! Great buffet selection as well as meat floating in between tables, one of the best places to go for dinner or have a celebration"}
{"text":"I went here for a special promotion called \"Game Night\", which was occurring during the last Monday of the month in the winter. 

While I thought the food was very good quality and perfectly seasoned, I found the service a bit below par compared to other Brazilian/Rodizio type food  places that I've been to.  One was in Myrtle Beach and the other was in Chicago, and food was constantly flowing every 2-3 minutes.  At first, it took anywhere between 5-10 minutes for each serving of meat to come out.  So in order to get all the meat you like, it'd probably take around 1.5 to 2 hours.  

So it's a nice night out, but in order to enjoy everything, you need at least 2 hours to get decently full (possibly 2.5 hours if you are a big eater).  

To like: nice selection of salads and prepared meats at the buffet table, bison (on Game Meat night) was amazingly juicy, and cooked like a perfect medium rare steak.  Most meats were not too salty.  Venue is nice.  

Dislike: Service is a bit iffy. I don't think it's the servers' fault at all, but the kitchen needs to have an ongoing rotation of meat.  The skewers were never totally full when they came to our tables, so people would keep missing out on the good meats and a lot of the time, we'd be stuck with sausage or chicken wings.  I know this happens at a lot of Brazilian buffet type places as they want to fill you up on the cheap meat, and then serve you the more expensive meat later.  I think this is more the fault of the kitchen, than the server themselves.  Our server was very good though.  

Verdict: I think I would come here on a special occasion who I can hold a conversation with, but not with people who are impatient and just want to eat.  I would say this is more of a \"bar/drinks\" type place than an eating establishment.  So if you want to sit down, chat and plan an entire night around it, go for it, however I wouldn't have any other set committments."}
{"text":"Touro is a Brazilian steakhouse which follows the typical green (feed me) and red (I'm full) coaster format.  First one I went to like this was Texas de Brazil, in Texas of course.  That restaurant is a winner through and through.  Touro is not quite there, but I can safely say it's better than Copacabana or Brasa in Niagara.

I'm glad to see they opened up a patio and added an a la carte menu.  The AYCE is way to heavy and pricy for lunch.  If you want to have a chance of survival in East Beaver Creek area, you need a lunch crowd.  As is the interior, the patio is decked out.  Beautiful couch seating on imitation grass , comfortable table seating, TVs to watch the World Cup, etc.

Started with the 50% off Caipirinha (thanks Yelp!).  Not often I try a truly unique drink, so that was a treat.  Similar to mojito, but not quite.

Next was the coconut shrimp appetizer.  Good sized shrimp, fried properly, and a sweet sauce with just enough spice.

Lastly, after seeing Jennifer K's picture, I ordered the Brazilian cheesesteak.  If I wasn't lazing around I would complain that it took 30 mins after my app to come out.  Just after finishing that sentence I was brought a complimentary beer, all is good in the world.  My cheesesteak was very good, had a pretzel type bun and loads of steak.  Should have skipped the app, but as always my eyes are bigger than my stomach."}
{"text":"Beautiful place.  Service was very slow. Had to wait long times for more meat to come to the table.  The food was decent but expect more for the price.  Wont go out of my way to go again but will probably be back at some point"}
{"text":"Service - not good.  Our server was incredibly inefficient.  I felt totally ignored because he was tending to his larger tables.  I had to flag him down so we could order our wine, and flag him down to get our bill after being done for over 15 minutes.  We never got refills on water and our dirty plates lingered for a while, definitely not even close to the service you would expect.

Salad bar - Yes, they had mussels, but everything else is cheap. The worst quality I have ever seen compared to similar steakhouses.  School lunch meat looking tray is so unappealing, at least the potatoes and black beans were good?

Meat - cheap cuts dominate here.  The highlight, which should be the picanha, was the worst tasting, so bland!  The beef rib was very good, pork was tasty but overcooked, same with the lamb. Grilled pineapple was very good, but that definitely doesn't make a good meal.

This place is SO overrated!  The service and food is so mediocre.  I have been twice now and will never go back.  At $45, I don't think it is worth it at all.  I guess they spend all that money they make on you for rent and decor?"}
{"text":"It's hard to rate Brazilian rodizio's, because I've found they're all pretty much the same, with some slight variation in execution.

Touro has a great interior, is spaced apart well, so you don't feel crowded in, and the food is pretty much what you expect.  My better half thinks Copacabana actually has higher quality meat which is also seasoned more strongly, but I'm not as sure - anyway, it's close enough that for me, it doesn't really matter.

The one thing they do execute better than all the other Brazilian rodizio's i've been to is the Pao de Queijo (cheese puffs) - I love these little buggers, and they are what I imagine they are supposed to be like, ever so slightly dense and chewy.  Mmmmm.

If you're up here, and looking to stuff yourself with meat, eat here."}
{"text":"Spent my Thursday night at this Brazillian Steakhouse. Came into this dine in with reasonably high expectations considering the price. Its about 60$ with tip and is an all you can eat experience. They have a walk up buffet with appetizers like soup, meatballs, salad etc. The walk up buffet was quite underwhelming, i ended up regretting adding most of the items i put on my plate. 

The concept of the all you can eat was explained rather smoothly by our server. Basically they bring out meat to the service area and offer you slabs of meat. You are given a coaster like object with two sides, one being red and one being green. We were given instructions to flip it to the red side when not wanting meat and to the green when hungry. The meat started coming out shortly after we arrived and was being pumped out at a good pace. Some meat was good some meat was bad but we were getting a nice variety and fast service. We had a good amount of meat and flipped our coaster to the red side for a short break. Then when we decided to start our second round of chowing, thats when things started to go down hill. The service seemed to have slowed down considerably and we were getting lots of repeats of meats when we were really only hoping to get the certain meats we enjoyed. The dessert was unincluded in the all you can eat cost which was kinda dissapointing. 

To sum up the service was average and the food did not meet my divine expectations. I dont really recommend it considering all the different options in the plaza and its price tag. Some of the meat is quite pleasant but its wildly inconsistent. 

If the business owners are reading... I highly recommend after the first round of service giving your guests a menu and the option of their favorite meats. This would make the dining experience much more pleasant for your high paying customers."}
{"text":"It's a Saturday night and it's busy but we had great service from our waitress! The salad bar was very good especially with those guacamole. The restaurant is very nice with very spacious tables. The meat is little above average. Overall I would go again but it would not be a first choice. The price should be a touch lower if you ask me. They didn't have any dancers which was disappointed. Their front door should have more light. Had a great time still!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place, the decor is beautiful. Nicer than the other Rodizio places I have been to, but did not really match the theme, it was nice and quiet. the wine menu from the ipad is a nice touch! but it could be overwhelming with the countries and grapes, so much to choose from!

first, parking here you need to be very lucky, cause even the valet gets full?
I generally hate coming to any restaurant in this plaza, cause i just simply do not want to bother with parking.

the entrance is a bit of a mess, there's lots of people standing around. Make reservations ahead of time, cause even with that, you sometimes have to wait.

The salad bar was beyond disappointing, there wasn't anything I liked at all.... first time this has happened to me at a AYCE salad bar, since i always like to try a bit of everything. Grabbed some guacamole and went back to my seat.

The meat took a long time to come... and when it FINALLY came, they were ALL coming at us at once from left and right. Everything came at once! except the pineapple everyone talked about of course.

I didn't like how the meats came in waves, they came all at the same times, and my meat was getting cold, cause I can't eat it all at once quickly enough! I have tried every single type of meat they offered and I didn't enjoy any of it, they were all tough and dry and flavorless. 

Finally we asked for the Pineapple, and someone came over with 2 brand new HOT pineapples, I got the caramelized piece from the outside, and I do not understand the hype? it was overly sweet and the inside of the pineapple and sour on the inside so super sweet mixed with super sour (not something my taste buds enjoy)

total for one person was $60 including tax & tips. A bit overpriced and over rated, I would rather have a nice piece of steak, than this so called AYCE eat dry meat that i did not enjoy. How much meat can you eat anyways?"}
{"text":"For all the meat lovers out there. This is the place to go. Service was great and they bring and cut different slices of meats right in front of you. They also have an all you can eat salad bar if you're vegetarian."}
{"text":"4.5 star if it were an option because there were only a few things that I could nitpick. Food was fresh and amazing. Both the meat offerings as well as the salad and appetizer bar! The salad bar was very fresh and offered some tasty pairings for the meat. Some of the meats were hit and miss. The flank steak and lamb were by far my favourite. While some of the other cuts were under seasoned or a bit tough in texture even for the steak cooked rare. 
Service was fairly quite good. The gentlemen carrying the meat were fast and efficient however the other servers could've been a touch quicker on water and clearing plates and bringing bill. I also found the service inconsistent as the table next to us received a wine 'schpiel' and were given the wine iPad menu while this was not offered to us. 

We went on a Sunday evening at 615 which I would say if you go any later in the evening it's going to get paaaacked. I would maybe prefer to go on a week day as the steep price of 47.99 for dinner ran us pretty high when it came to paying and having filled up on steak early on I felt like the price was a little unjustified. All that being said I would still give 4.5 stars. My FAVOURITE dish the entire night was the baked basa fish on the appetizer bar..even better than the steak and chicken in my honest opinion."}
{"text":"Brazlian steakhouse ? Yes please. Touro is first place I've seen with the Red/Green card. You leave a colour facing up and as the servers holding the giant skewers walk by they will offer you a cut if you leave it on green. Red is vice versa they will just leave you be. Service was intensely fast and the food quality is top notch as well as the appetizer bar. Love bacon wrapped food and thats about sums it up for me."}
{"text":"Two other friends and I attended Touro on a Friday evening, we were initially ignored by 5 young ladies that invested their entire focus at the reception area on one small group of customers. It would appear that their customer service was limited to a single group of customers, poor value for their hourly wage times five. 

We were seated shortly there after, the decor of the restaurant was quite impressive, service initially started out as quite promising but quickly declined 

My theory on this Brazilian styled restaurant is as follows.  I believe they have this down to a science.  Your first offering is quick and efficient with poorer cuts of meat served first.  For reasons unknown and with your disk displaying more, service is non existent, and it only gets worse.  I think they realize that it takes approximately four minutes for your body to realize it's full, so the longer you wait to be served the less you will consume.  We had flagged down the waiter asking why service was so poor and additionally the manager, they in turn will enquire as to which meat you would like, I thought the entire concept was to readily be served 15 different varieties, not specifically one or two upon frustration and request, verbally, defeats the purpose.  The over all quality of flavour and tenderness was poor.  In conclusion for forty four dollars per person, I could get better quality service and food for the equivalent at most moderately priced steak houses.  So never again, we tipped handsomely, regardless and were convinced that the future for this place will be limited to bankruptcy, once it's novelty wears off."}
{"text":"The salad bar was unappetizing and dull. The men with skewers came around with the meat sporadically as they tended to the larger groups more frequently. We were pretty much left waiting for the leftovers from the larger group. The meat was alright, seasoned all the same. Everything tasted the same after a while. The only standout was the pineapples - large and smothered with cinnamon. YUM
Total for two people can easily go over the $100 mark, quite pricey for the quality of the food. If it weren't for my $20 gift card, I probably wouldn't have stepped into this restaurant."}
{"text":"Note: This is more of a 3.5 star rating then 3.0 star.

Decided pay this rodizio a visit for a birthday celebration.

Tip: If you check-in via Yelp, you can redeem a coupon for 50% off a caipirinha (a Brazilian lemon/lime cocktail)!

One half of it is a rodizio and the other is a wine bar & lounge for the young professionals crowd.  The decor is very nice and ambience feels upscale but relaxed.  There is a dress code in effect but it just means no \"holy\" clothes, sneakers, and bum clothes.

We went on a Thursday evening which offered additional seafood options such as swordfish, bacon-wrapped scallops, and shrimp.

On the whole, the experience at Touro is very pleasent with excellent service staff and a good variety of protein to sample over the course of the evening.  The servers do come by at a good pace with offerings such as parmesan steak, flank steak, chicken, and beef ribs. Although the bacon-wrapped scallops never really seemed to make it to our table and had to ask staff to direct them to us.  The appetizer island had a pretty decent selection of sides to go along with the proteins.

My only nitpicks were the following but they would not prevent from returning:
   1. The meats seem to be unevenly seasoned.  Some of it was a tad too salty and some lacked it throughout.  Can be fixed by adding some of the sauces they provide for your table.
   2. Sometimes the servers would just cut you a big hunk of fat with some lean meat tagging along.
   3. I was disappointed to see that a majority of the meat was cooked medium and above when it was served at my table.  I'd like to see a little ruby red."}
{"text":"$50 for that?  Really?  

I've been before for lunch and it was ok.  Dinner included a couple extra cuts of meat but is double the price.   

The salad bar is pretty bad and definably lacking. 

All the other Brazilian steakhouses in the city are far better.   Even the ones in Niagara Falls, which is a tourist trap, is better quality.  

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Much respect for all the varieties of hot sauces. 

Went here on a short notice but glad I did. 

It's on the pricey side for a usual dinner out for me but I have already made reservations for Valentines this year.  

It was basically a buffet with the salad bar and side dishes off to one side.  Servers will come by your table with different cuts of meat and you can opt for yes or no as indicated by your circular placecard: red for no and green for yes. 

All in all a wonderful dining experience that u truly enjoyed.  Beautiful decor and delicious food are all you need to set a perfect date with someone special or company function."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a traditional Brazilian Steakhouse and oh boy, was I ever impressed!!!  They set an outstanding first impression with the modern, classy and elegant decor right as we walked in the door.  The restaurant is absolutely beautiful!

As we were sat down at the table, we were given an iPad to look through with a very extensive wine list on it: one of the many cool features of this restaurant.  We were quickly greeted by staff with food right away.  (I was warned before dining here that I should not eat lunch).  I had a nice 9oz glass of the pinot noir, and decided to try a Caipirinha- the national drink of Brazil- and it was great! Once we were settled in, the server was excellent in explain how it all worked, since I was new to the whole experience.

The 'appetizer island' was a salad bar/buffet with so many choices of hot and cold items.  I think our server said over 40!  Some traditional Brazilian food items and some classic home favourites: salads, chicken pasta, potatoes, grilled vegetables, soup, brushetta, a fillet of salmon and lots more but those were my favourites!  When we sat down to eat all of the food from the buffet, we were only greeted with more food! All we had to do was turn out 'medallion' from red (meaning stop service) to green (meaning \"bring on the meat\").  All of the servers were Brazilian which made the experience feel really authentic.  It seemed a bit overwhelming at first, but at least I was able to try everything and I got to know my favourites.  I tried Picanha for the first time and it was so moist and juicy. There wasn't anything I really didn't like: all flavourful and fresh. We also had some sauces to compliment the meats... even though they weren't necessary; the Chimmichurri was amazing on the top and bottom sirloins. 

Once we had all finally tapped out, we were offered dessert. Although I didn't have room to try anything, I will definitely save room for the next time I am back... and trust me.... I will be back!

Definitely 5 stars for Touro!!!"}
{"text":"My benchmark for Brasilia style buffet is in New York and at $75 pop it is not a fair comparison but it is authentic latin American food

Had an enjoyable lunch but would expect better dinner in reference to grilled meat offering

They have a decent salad bar with your typical items that come from a can. Hmm  what's you saying bro?

Several salads all fresh , dressings are not home made, sliced beets, olives, etc are prepackaged items.

Excellent quinoa salad by the way

A soup of the day   

Pork and bean soup was tasty

Potato salad, some cold cuts, cheese, and sliced apples with mayonnaise

The Salad bar on its own is a satisfying  lunch

The drama is all about the grilled meats served up on swords hot off the bbq grill and sliced up for you

We had sausage, 2 types of beef, chicken wings and some ribs. They were all good and don't be shy eat all you want

Not bad for lunch 

No complaints but it is $25 per person and you will get your money's worth and more if you are super hungry

It's a very fancy room and Nigel our server was very nice and impeccable in his attention to us.

For dinner it is more expensive so my expectation would be for chicken breasts and fish being served and maybe some more elaborate buffet items

I was disappointed only on the buffet. As a foodie i was expecting something more artisinal in the price point and more gourmet

Canned sliced olives along side Kalamata olives  , grilled beets not canned sliced beats, Italian dressing that isn't Kraft, maybe for ace bakery or foccacia breads not pitta squares, no nacho chips or hummus.  

I was expecting stuff that was Brazilian or latin on the salad bar instead.

It was still a nice lunch and may be different for dinner and came here with no ideas in my head except that it was a brazilian style bbq restaurant.

It is that indeed but it isn't really that at all and for many they don't care but for the elite foodies they do expect some authenticity"}
{"text":"Had our company holiday party there.

Beautiful decor. Comfortable. More extravagant than one would expect.

The staff was very welcoming and personable but at the night progressed it became a bit obvious that they were understaffed which led to a service inconsistancy.

The buffet was plentiful and tasty. The eggplant could have been better.

The meat was good, but just so. It was overcooked more often than not, ranging from medium to well done. The most dissapointing aspect was the lack of variety. Heard more than one complaint about saltyness but seasoning was not bad for me.

Wine selection was confusing and not organized well.

Post-dinner service was the worst aspect of the night. Waited a very long time for our orders and they ran out of tea due to a supplier switch.

I'd go back, but to be perfectly honest I'd prefer Copacabana."}
{"text":"I had not eaten in one of these Brazilian all-you-can-eat steakhouses in a while, and given the proximity to my hotel, I decided to give this place a try.  If you haven't been to one of these places before, the concept is a meat-eater's paradise where servers deposit different cuts of meat, non-stop (if you'd like) on your plate until you get stuffed beyond oblivion.  They encourage you to stop by their salad bar which has a decent selection.  The greek salad was good, the beets ok, and the fruit salad was super.  I liked the roasted peppers as well.  I also tried the lasagna which was way too salty for me.  

The meat was pretty good overall - one of the sausage dishes was too salty and the bacon wrapped chicken was too dry, but everything else was cooked well and tasty.  I really enjoyed the grilled pineapples (with cinnamon) which seems to be very popular amongst Yelpers.

The décor is quite modern and service was good overall.  The meat servers were on top of things, but I never got my water glass filled, unfortunately.

The price is variable according to day of the week and time of the day, but for a Friday night, the meal cost me $60 including tip and tax."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day dinner. Service was sub par. The restaurant was very busy yet the service was quite slow. After about 3 rounds of meat, it just really slowed down to the point that we were just sitting around and eventually had to flag servers down to ask for meat. We also had to ask for refills a couple of times. 

The food was average. Everything tasted bland except for the chicken, which is disappointing considering this is a steakhouse. Of all the mediocre steaks, the bacon wrapped and parmesan steak were the top ones. Their salad bar was decent and included different greens, potato salad, crab salad, olives, cheese, salami, ham, prosciutto, and other food items including soup, rice and beans, baked basa, alfredo bowtie pasta, and meatballs. 

Actually, the best food item was the grilled pineapple. It was delicious! It was sweet, packed with cinnamon, and melted in your mouth! 

After the pineapple, the next best thing about this restaurant is the decor. It is very nicely decorated with beautiful lights and an impressive wine bottle wall. The individual bathrooms were also very nice. 

Overall, for a $49.99 per person weekend dinner, I expected much more. I would not recommend this restaurant and will not be returning. 

Food: 2/5
Service: 2/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Value: 2/5"}
{"text":"This place looks very nice. Really high ceilings, spacious, trendy amd comfortable. The food was all pretty blah. Their meat selection is a hit-or-miss. Sometimes it could be cold and tough as nails, sometimes it'll be hot, juicy and tender. On the plus side, they serve cotton candy for dessert."}
{"text":"I had a long extended break from Touro after being a Sunday brunch regular for 3-4 years. There were too many issues with service etc. Very recently for my birthday my hubby asked where i wanted to go. I looked around at some menus and kept coming back to Touro's. I couldn't believe the pricing for their weekday lunch - 8 cuts of meat for $24.75! What a perfect way to try out their lunch menu (we're brunch regulars & been there for 2-3 private events). We went in on a Tuesday, it was surprisingly quiet. We were greeted immediately very warmly by the young lady at the front of the house. She seated us where we wanted to sit at the banquet table. She asked if we were familiar with Touro or had been there before. We explained that we hadn't been there for brunch. She went through the cuts of meat & the appetizer island options with us. She then took our drink order and explained she would return with some bread & our drinks. The bread - i have no words! So amazing & warm. If i had to explain it, i would compare it to Yorkshire Pudding (she happily brought us more after we devoured it!). Their food has always been top notch, so we were thrilled that the service had improved greatly!

I love the selection at lunch, here are the 8 cuts of meat:

Picanha - if you haven't tried this cut of steak, you are seriously missing out! Perfectly grilled and super delish! 2nd time it was brought around it was a little too rare, our gaucho brought back medium cuts not well done/blackened meat as i have experienced on several other visits at brunch.

Garlic steak - one of my new favs! First time i had tried this item, it's not on their Sunday Brunch menu. The steak was seasoned perfectly and was so tender. Not an overkill of garlic - a must try!

Sausages - amazing!

Top sirloin - we actually didn't even have any, lol! We stuck to the Picanha & Garlic steak

Chicken Wings - juicy chicken seasoned & bbq'd to perfection - they were fairly large pieces too.

Pork ribs - the only item I wasn't entirely crazy about. I'm a bbq sauce rib kinda gal. My hubby really enjoyed them though

Chicken thighs - juicy chicken seasoned & bbq'd to perfection

Leg of lamb - seasoned so well, melt in your mouth good

The grilled pineapple - OMG! Still and always has been one of my fav items at Touro.

The appetizer island offered: rice, beans, soup, 3-4 types of salad, 3 types of lettuce with add ons a variety of dressings, meatballs, mixed steamed vegetables, variety of grilled vegetables, seafood salad etc. 

I would have given them 5 stars, but i took 1 away for their kids pricing. On a few different occasions we had this discussion with other diners at Touro where they agreed that the pricing for kids is a bit high. Even if kids enjoy steak etc., most under the age of 8 or even 9 wont eat 4-12 different cuts of meat. My 3 year old would be free for lunch & dinner, I would have to pay $15-$25 for my 6 yr old who only eats 1 cut of meat there with rice. We will go back once in a while, but not as often as we used to since we won't be taking our kids there. 

Something has certainly changed at Touro with the service. I am so happy to see that, as it was a fav place of ours to go to. If you're unsure about paying the dinner pricing, you should definitely check it out for Sunday Brunch (4 cuts of meat) or weekday lunch (8 cuts of meat)! Keep in mind though, dinner is a higher price because it's dinner (12 cuts of meat) & a show.

Our server Nikita was amazing! We didn't even have to ask for drink refills, she kept our drinks topped up and checked on us frequently. She made the return experience a great one for us! 

Thank you for the wonderful experience Touro & see you again soon!"}
{"text":"We decided to spend a special occasion at Tuoro for a lovely evening. When we arrived, the hostess were able to accommodate us without a reservation, which was very gracious. Our server then provided us with direction on the green/red coasters and the appetizer station.

Appetizer Station: A fair assortment of steamed veggies, salads, calamari (awesome) gauc, meatballs and other appies. I trust one can get full in these alone, but we managed to hold off until the star of the show. Of note. The fruit assortments should be reviewed, as it were exclusively grapes and pineapple cubes.  Make sure to take a few sauces for the meat!

Meats: Our favorites we're the chicken leg and short ribs. The other cuts we're generally overdone, some chewy lacking in flavour, others with fat and gristle. In truth, I think anyone would generally be impressed with the selection and amount of food, but after a few minutes of worldwind table service, we had to flip over those coasters. 

For a Brazilian restaurant, the music selection seemed to favour salsa and merengue exclusively, without any of the dancing entertainment one would expect. For the price point, there was no entertainment nor was desert included in the menu. The guys wore traditional outfits, but seemed to be in your orbit and was a bit much, however that goes with this type of buffet. I would recommend that they consider providing coasters with pictures of the cuts, so you can flip the ones you want over, without the same being offered to you time and again. 

As stated in all reviews and true to form, the pineapple is excellent, warm and cinnamony. However, at the end of the day a $50 price point is excessive, and I would say based in the quality and that dessert is not included, a maximum of $35 is more than reasonable. In fairness, we did have an on line offering $20 off for the table, which was definitely an incentive to try. I would ask them to double check in the ID if those celebrating birthdays, not that I'm skeptical but a dozen an hour?

The service overall was was good, and our server, though busy, was thoughtful and sincere in her aim to please. Good job!  

Overall a good experience but the cuts were a bit inconsistent in flavour,  the music not effective of Brazil, no entertainment on this Saturday, no real fruit selection or dessert which really should be included in a $50 price point. Let me know when you guys offer those extras and I'll update the review!!"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful. The service is very good and the food is amazing. I would definately go there again."}
{"text":"Let the meat sweats begin!  Sure, expect to pay more for AYCE meat, but compared to a ribeye at Ruth's Chris, this is actually a deal!

There is a hot table with a variety of veggies and other side dishes, but I just sample, saving space for the endless parade of sword grilled meats that come by the table. 

The one \"non meat\" item is the grilled pineapple, coated in sugar and cinnamon. It could be desert by itself!  Of course they also have a desert menu, but if you did your part correctly, you won't have room!"}
{"text":"For the price it is 100% not worth it. We were told we had used up all of our time and was forced to be rushed out when the restaurant wasn't even busy. Food is okay, for maybe half of it's price. The servers were so cold.. I even get better customer service from the Mcdonalds drive thru window! Never again, Toronto has so much more to offer."}
{"text":"A contemporary decor already sets t this restaurant apart from others. The grilled pineapple is soft and sweet. Meat variety is abundant. The only downside is buffet table is too small. Line up gets too long and we had to start with meat instead to wait for the line to die down. Dessert is great, nice presentation and taste."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????order????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Finally there's a churrascaria north of city! Touro aka TORO aka BULL....
The place very chic, contemporary, spacious, clean and for the most part has visual appeal :) With a whole wine rack wall, to beautiful chandeliers, big red lamps, and comfy seating Touro is a great place to take a date.....Ah the ambiance ;) 
Since it was my first time here, I figured I'd go FULL out and try their all your can eat AYCE. during mon-thursdays their prices can be quite steep, lunch being $25, dinner can run anywhere from $37-45. However with a gift certificate from a previous Yelp Elite Event, and checking IN!! bang I was able to try their Caiprianha drink at half price.
Their buffet includeds the appetizer table; beef meatballs, veggies, cheese, cold cuts, grilled veggies, etc...this is just a side show from the REAL cuts of meats that's to come.  Once at your table you're given a circle coaster one side Green (Bring me more meats) and RED (no more....for now lol) Once we flipped over the coaster to green, one after another chefs came out presenting various cuts of meats from piranha (brazilian steak), top sirloin, pork sausage, grilled chicken, bacon wrapped chicken, Beef ribs, parmesan steak, and their grilled pineapple seasoned with cinnamon and brown sugar. 
I must say for the price, you do get a lot of selection, and the service is top notch!....plus you know for the most part, the ones preparing the meats are brazilian/portuguese since I can differentiate being Spanish speaking lol... 
Overall I would definitely come back to TOURO perhaps to try their a-la-carte, but ill have to see how my mood is."}
{"text":"Brazilian BBQ isn't a cheap meal. But it IS unique, fun, and very good. Touro is a great place for Brazilian but I personally would give the edge to Copacabana as I prefer the way they prepare certain things. At the very least Touro is worth a visit to compare. Who knows, you might prefer it."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday brunch celebration and was impressed by Touro. We loved the picanha and of course the grilled pineapple. There were lots of selections in the buffet aside from the meats and they were excellent too. The servers were attentive to our needs. I would surely recommend this restaurant to families and friends and would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant.. 

Don't get me wrong it's beautifully decorated and we were very excited to try out this restaurant as we'd read some good reviews. But unfortunately for the price that they charge per plate I felt really ripped off. The meat itself was good, albeit strangely seasoned for some cuts, but only if you were able to get it from a skewer that had just come out of the kitchen. Otherwise it was dry and for some cuts over cooked.  

The buffet of appetizers wasn't the kind of quality that you should expect from a restaurant of that caliber and reminded me of if a university cafeteria and a east side Mario's made a strange love child. Just vaguely bland and salty. 

I lm disappointed that I drove to Richmond Hill and paid over a hundred dollars for something I could've made better in my own kitchen for less than half the price.  I regret going.

I hope if you go you have a better experience than we did."}
{"text":"Been here three times already, just because the family (kids) enjoys it. My honest opinion is that it's over priced. We always choose the buffet. Never tried a la cart. 
Buffet:- lots of variety, but in all honesty, pretty much tasteless. Not much flavour to anything. 
The BBQ/meats:- very tasty. Cooked perfectly. 
Service:- hit or miss. We've had both. But for the amount of money we spend there, I'd expect way better service. 
You'll get bombarded with food then they will completely ignore you (even if you ask the staff to send someone over). Almost like they're dictating how much you should eat. 
So should you try this place? Why not. Fun, hip atmosphere. But be prepared to feel like you've spent a little too much for the food and service."}
{"text":"Food as always was very good. Sadly the service has consistently gone downhill since opening. Now they even ignore the phone and don't bother to return messages, makes it tough to make reservations. Waited 20 minutes for my drink order, it was wrong, 15 minutes later it was right, at least they took it off the bill but 35 minutes is a long time to get a drink. Hopefully they can turn this around as it used to be a 5 star but for now its the Keg in the same complex for me."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! The setting is fantastic, with high ceilings that spacious table setting. The salad/appetizer buffet, while not as extensive as Fogo de Chão, is still solid with excellent fresh cold and hot offerings. 

The star, however, is the meat selection. succulent, well-seasoned cuts of meats that are not over-salted, like other places. The grilled pineapple with cinnamon and brown sugar makes for a great dessert! 

Service is fantastic. Our server, Ali, was on point and catered to our birthday party every request!"}
{"text":"I love Touro and it helps that it is very close to us. The restaurant has a nice ambiance. It's big, lots of space to move around. I also like the bar which is very modern and pleasant. Unlike other Brazilian BBQ places where they feel compelled to drown you in live music, there is none of that at Touro. I don't know why most places in GTA have live music which prevents good conversation. 

The reason this place is not a 5 star is the salad bar. The selection of meat is good and most of the cuts taste very good. I have been to many Brazilian BBQ places in the Americas and Japan and they all have certain cuts of meat that are beter than others. It's the same at Touro. The only downer is the salad bar that is not appealing at all.

I did not like the breaded fried bananas and the grilled pineapple. Not sweet enough and too much cinnamon. I like the fried bananas Fogo de Chao style.

Overall, we go to Touro once a month and we are always satisfied."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Brazilian steakhouse, we went the rodizio route.  We didn't make reservations but managed to get there early and was given almost 2 hours to eat and vacate the table which was more than enough time for us.

Are server was very attentive and checked up on us to make sure we were ok especially since it was our first time.

We went to the appetizer island first and we filled a plates - that alone pretty much filled us up so don't overdo it.  Then we went on to the endless supply of meats.  We felt that the meats were a bit on the salty side and they all pretty much tasted the same.  We were so thirsty after dinner probably from our massive salt consumption.  The grilled pineapple in between complimented the meats in a nice way.

There were Brazilian dancers and capoeira to entertain us.  It was a nice dinner - it is definitely something different.  It's worth a try if you've never tried Brazilian cuisine."}
{"text":"Me and the mrs. took the drive out here tonight, made it in no time via the 407.. Generally a very positive experience, service was really good too. I asked our waiter if there were any type of potatoes, because I like potatoes with my steak, and he disappeared into the back for a few minutes and came back with a special stuffed baked potato that they put together for me, definitely wasn't on the buffet table. A really nice touch. Matthew, our waiter was prompt on all refills and kept my beers full (Hop City), definitely deserved the tip.

Alcoholic beverages were intuitively described and displayed by use of an iPad Mini which the GF thought was really cool, but I think its kind of gimmicky, my pops would have never been able to read it. 

Good draught beer selection but at steep costs of $8.50/pint and upwards.

First i tried their signature Brazilian drink made with Cachaça (the ones you've seen Bourdain gulp down in the brazil episodes) and it was tasty and very strong but at a whopping $10 per drink. Served in a lowball glass it went down in 4 gulps, so yeah, not cheap to keep up with those things all night. very sweet with lots of sour lime. one was enough.

Briefly the hits and misses as far as menu items go were as follows:

hits - chicken drumsticks, bacon wrapped chicken breast, bacon wrapped filet mignon (ask for the rare ones though), pork ribs (very basic but a nice touch, haven't seen these at Brasa nor Copacabana), Rib Eye, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, pineapple (best to date of all 3 places maybe), the fried polenta, and the complimentary cheese puff buns

misses - the nicely frenched double lamb chops would have made the hits list but all of them were completely grey and well done, rump steak (tough and fatty and chewy. they really liked trying to unload this one it seems too, we kept sending the poor guy away. by far they came around at least twice to three times more than any other cut), rump steak rubbed with garlic (GF liked these, I didn't), short ribs (too fat, and a strange \"funky\" taste on these), sausage (just very ordinary and not a nice char on them)

leg of lamb ran out before it got to us, as did the garlic rubbed pork chops

the table is set with 3 complementary apps (plantain fries, fried polenta, panko fried banana) which are unlimited refills, as are the 3 sauces set tableside (smoky barbeque, chimichurri, and a bright yellow chutney)


It's not something you go do often, but we will definitely return when in the mood. I don't find Brasa nor Copacabana to be any better than this.. and yeah, very good service was definitely worth mentioning. 

However be careful not to get raped on the alcohol prices though, i think it's over the top expensive, and discourages people from buying more than one.  I had to take a star for this"}
{"text":"We were craving Brazilian steak and unfortunately Copa was over booked. We came over to Touro and was seated immediately on a Saturday night. The waiter was great, comical, friendly and checked on us frequently. The downside was the people serving meat, since our table was by the door, they would skip us. On many occasions we saw them serve the table right behind us but just turn around and not even acknowledge there was another table to serve. This was very annoying so we told our waiter and he made his best efforts to see this didn't happen. After his second attempt the meat was served to us. I would say the waiter definitely made it worth it but the flavours and seasoning are still not as good as their competitor. It didn't help that they carved off such huge pieces of meat that we were full before having the chance to try anything new. 
This experience was significantly better then my last experience so I have them an extra star. The next two stars will only be achieved through consistent good service and better food quality. Let's hope it gets there."}
{"text":"I hope that my brief visit here was an anomaly. After waiting in the lobby with three or four other small groups for a hostess to 'greet and seat', two staff spent the better part of five minutes staring into the seating chart on their POS monitor before finally looking up and announcing to all that if we didn't have reservations we could expect a thirty minute wait ..., the restaurant was at approximately 30% capacity by my estimate!  What happened to greeting guests as they enter? Why is there a 30 minute wait when 70 percent of your tables are vacant?  Staff issues?  No one looked terribly happy, especially the hostess who appeared not to be bothered making eye contact with any of the twenty or so people patiently waiting .... The food may be good, but the front of house needs A LOT of work. We won't be back. Waiting in line should happen at the train station NOT an otherwise empty restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'd like to state that I don't usually post reviews unless I've had an incredibly memorable experience. But my experience at Touro was definitely review-worthy. 

We came here for Rodizio a few weekends ago after hearing about its grand opening a month or so ago. The atmospher was nice and new but lacked privacy. Our table was very close to the next table which seated a family of four on one side and a couple on the other side. The intimate proximity to our neighbors made us feel a uncomfortable considering this is supposed to be an upscale restaurant with a strict dress code.

The food was not very good. The choices of meats were small - they kept bringing out rump steak and short ribs throughout the whole night and I have to agree with other reviewers that the meats were full of fat, very salty, and chewy. We counted there were only about 5 types of meats that were served, no lambs, no seafood, and no pork. The chicken drumsticks marinated in beer and herbs were salty on the outside and dry on the inside. 

What started the downward spirral for the night was when one of the servers came by, I tried using the tongs to pick up the meat that he was slicing but it slipped and fell on the table. The server did not offer me another piece and moved on to the next table as if he expected me to eat it. After reading other reviews, apparently this happens a lot.

The staff did not seem very knowledgeable. We asked one \"gaucho\" (meat server) what the sauces on our table were for and he had no idea. Apparently his only accountability was to cut meat, nothing else. The wait time was ridiculously long for asking for drinks. Our water never got refilled and our waitress never came by to check to see how our meal was. 

There was no music or live entertainment on a weekend evening either. Overall, the experience was unsatisfying. We really expected more from a newly opened restaurant located in the entertainment district of Richmond Hill. Also, I tried posting my review on their \" http://tourosteakhouse.com/contact/reviews/ \" website that claims to be \"unmoderated\" but my review never got published. Hmm... 100% customer satisfaction? I think not."}
{"text":"The service was decent. The setting and ambience is very nice. The concept is fun. The wine list and tasting menu are great. The actual meats are average taste and quality. The salad buffet had a nice selection and good taste. 

The average meal without alcohol is about $60 per person. 

Overall the experience was pleasant and a nice night out, however I will never go back, because I hate the location.  Parking is always a struggle. I drove around for 20 minutes to find a spot. Space is limited and the snow is not cleared nicely. With so many good choices out there, why get aggravated before I arrive?"}
{"text":"Touro competes against the likes of Coco. I have to say I enjoyed my first time here as service by Nigel was great. He really knows his job and he works hard to keep you happy. If you get Nigel, you will have a good time.
So how were the cuts of meat? For a protein heavy eater like myself, I loved all the cuts of meat. It was satisfying and very tasty. The selection was skewed (excuse the pun :P) towards the cuts of beef and the other meats did not seem to come out as often. However, all you have to do is ask one of the servers to bring something out. The beef cuts were delicious though and my fav. The sausage was awesome and even the chicken had good flavor.
The salad bar was a needed touch and was fine for what it was. I would be disappointed if I only came for the salad bar. This place is for meat eaters. Vegetarians/vegans can make due but will feel left out.
The wine dispensing fountain contraption was a nice touch but I didnt see one person try it. The one drink my date had was really good. She really enjoyed it.
Overall, 4 **** stars with one star taken off for price. It is really expensive and a big hit on the wallet if you are paying for yourself and your date. But for what you are getting, I can see why they are charging so high. As I was walking out, I got a $10 gift card for my next dinner. A nice small touch. Would I come again? If someone took me here and paid, YES :P"}
{"text":"We went to Touro for the first time last night. I had bought one of those \"Community Appreciation Program\" coupon books but forgot to bring it with me. They said they wouldn't honour the discount that evening but would honour all coupons after their expiry dates so we could still use them anytime - that earns them one star because arbitrary limitations make me angry. The place is very contemporary and masculine in its decor (dark grey, burgundy) and it is a little too open concept for me. Lack of carpeting and divider walls makes it pretty loud in there. Their appetizer buffet contained meatballs and some other meats along with the salads, fruits and veggies; I think it would make more sense to have more veggie options instead of meat but what they did have was good, no complaints there. Since we were there Mon-Wed we could sample 12 cuts of Meat + Grilled Pineapple for $39.75. For AYCE I think this is very reasonable. The wine was $18 for a glass however, so they lose a star for that. Also some of the meat (Picanha, Top Sirloin) was a little overdone and the Parmesan Sirloin was blue rare in the middle, so I was a tad disappointed about that. All in all I didn't think the meat was really anything to write home about. The service was very good, Nigel was attentive and the meat servers were right there once we flipped our cards to green. I will go back with some other meat lovers in my family and I would recommend it as a different experience for anybody who hasn't tried a place like this before."}
{"text":"I went to Touro for a Yelp Event and am convinced to pen a quick review. I'll write a more detailed one once I visit this place for a full meal... which I am amazingly tempted to do but probably won't have time this month. We'll see. 

This restaurant sits in a location with atleast 10 more restaurants; which I think is absolutely crazy when it comes to competition, but their unique offering makes them popular and it's evident from the buzz indoors. What they offer is comparable to CopaCabana, Brasa and other Brazilian BBQ places. A quick look at their appetizer bar convinced me that their apps are better than CopaCabana for sure. I also had the opportunity to try a sampler palette and their food seems equally as good. 

Best bit but worst bit? They have a lunch buffet for 24 something dollars that would be perfect for a small appetite like mine... but it's on weekdays all they way in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I will keep my review really short.

Food: Awesome - tender, juicy, very tasty.  5 stars

Services from waiter - polite, well groom, okay execution.  3.5 stars

Buffet Table - good selection of cold meat, vegetables and soup.  Fresh.  Tasty.  5 stars

Availability of meat - slow, not enough game meat made to my table on game meat night, kind of beat the purpose of attending a game meat night special.  2 stars.

Decor - nice, classy.  Our section was tucked on the side, so that might be the reason the food didn't make rounds to us that frequently.  Sitting in the main section in the middle might be better; don't know.  4 stars 

Value - 2.5 stars due to the low availability of game meat.  Even the regular meat didn't make rounds fast.

Overall: 3.7 stars."}
{"text":"The place looks amazing inside.
They started us of with some fried banana and cheese bread, both of which we very tasty.  
Then we took a trip to the salad bar, where I probably got too much as the variety was huge. It was well laid out and everything fresh.
Then the meat started coming around and never stopped.  Lamb, bacon wrapped chicken, sausages, 2 types of ribs, so much steak... I could hardly get out of my chair when we finally left.  Not everything I tried was great, was not a fan of the ribs for instance, but overall the variety and quality of the meats, how they were prepared and just the vast amount available... awesome.

The highlight of the night for me was the grilled pineapple, it was a perfect way to end the meal... delicious. 

Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Touro!  The quality of the meat is fantastic!  The decor is gorgeous...LOVE the lighting!  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the patio is one of the best kept secrets in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"Very nice decor, nice meats delivered to you table Brazilian steakhouse style. Food was good, not exceptional, but good. Usually I dine in my favorite Brazilian restaurants time and again, because I like the BBQ style and very importantly extremely friendly service. 

Touro felt a little arrogant for me. The hostess was as friendly as restaurant policy dictated, in other words, not that good. There was some indifference and the overall service experience in general was a letdown compared to other B-bbq houses. 

A mediocre 3."}
{"text":"I personally loved the experience of Brazilian cuisine. If you are not a meat lover don't even think of stepping in. The restaurant was very well set; Beautiful, classy & sober. Service was excellent & you had more for what you paid.  The variety of meat was tasty. Some of it was a bit hard but overall good.  I had the traditional drink Caparnea a mix of rhum soda & lime. The best was the pineapple rolled in cinnamon & sugar grilled to perfection. It is one of the best Brazilian food I have ever tasted. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This place was really good!!! The antipasto buffet was amazing! All the cuts of beef were so good. The Parm Steak was amazing!!! Chicken was ok. Atmosphere is beautiful! Very reasonable price! I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"The only Brazilian all you can eat steakhouse uptown. The food was not bad, the service was very nice too.

On a Sunday they had an omelette station. The buffet consists of some breakfast basics, eggs, bacon, pancakes, yogurt, some fruit.
Also has some pasta and salad to choose from.

The meats were very fresh and warm. I find it a tad bit salty for a lot of the meats. One type of sausages. One lamb, one chicken, 2/3 types of beef and pork.

Overall very nice restaurant. The price tag is $26.99 on a Sunday brunch. Would prefer if they had Saturday lunch but they don't open on Saturdays."}
{"text":"2.5/5

Sorry. CopaCabana has you beat so far.

I visited this restaurant tonight with my family, after hearing my dad's colleague raving about this place. Seeing how I've been to CopaCabana in the past month, I decided to give this place a shot.

The appetizer/salad bar was promising. There was a lot more variety than at CopaCabana, and they even had soup! It definitely had more variety than CobaCabana, and it even tasted better too.

However, once the meat/main course came, the promising of an awesome meal turned to disappointment. All of the beef, despite the fact if it's flank, mignon, sirloin, etc. tasted the same: Dry and flavourless. The lamb tasted decent, but not the best I had. The pork and the sausage also tasted bland. Finally, the cheese balls, bread, and fried banana (the foods offered initially on your table) tasted nothing special, the best probably going to the banana and the worst going to the cheese balls. 

The salvaging factor in this was that the pineapple here was better than CopaCabana, and they also had a larger variety for dessert (plus the chocolate cake tasted very good!).

Service was a hit and miss depending on the waitress. One of them didn't know what an \"iced tea\" was, and actually tried to give us regular tea with ice cubes. At least the water was refilled consistently and the drinks were bottomless here.

Considering the money we paid (about $150 for 3), I can't see myself coming back in the short term.

PS: What free wifi? That needs to be edited, cause I asked for the wifi password, nobody was able to provide it to me."}
{"text":"Fancier version of Copa Cobana but higher price for all you can eat. Good experience but would rather go back to Copa for similar food. Celebrated a birthday here and they brought a chocolate cake with sparklers. The cake was surprisingly delicious :)"}
{"text":"The food at Touro was very good.

I've been too several different Brazilian restaurants over the last few years.  It's a great way to Sample many different flavours.

The place was large, very clean, and very well designed.  Every thing was attractive to the eye.

The food was plentiful with lots of different cuts of meat.  The Parmesan beef and garlic beef were by far my favourite.

The salad bar was nice with several options.  I especially liked the black beans and pork, and the beef stroganoff.  I would've like a few more options.

Some of the meats were very nice, but I found a lot of the meat cooked much more than I prefer.  I prefer my meat to be medium rare.  Most of the meat we were served were very well cooked.  Some were definitely well done.  The sausage was bordering on dryness.

The nice thing about this restaurant is that they had a lot of gluten free options.  All of the meats except for the chicken was gluten free.  The salad bar had a few options that were gluten free, and the tapioca buns they bring to the table are also gluten free.  I have to eat this way, but the food was good.

The service was excellent, and the servers were great.

This is an experience to do this type of meal.  The cost was $49.95 for each of us.  It is a lot of food, and you can eat as much as you want, but pace yourself, or you may explode."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and ambience and service staff were attentive but flavour was lacking, meats were generally overcooked in my opinion, beef selection was small and I did not enjoy the chicken. Pineapple and cheese bread were my favorite things were. 

Hostess quoted the wrong price for dinner at reservation."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant few times. I have to say the quality of their meat has been dropped since the first time I was there. And that is quite disappointing. I have high hopes for this restaurant. Nevertheless I still like this restaurant I would pay $50 for their meal. Their servers are very friendly (and might I add very attractive). The restaurant atmosphere is very inviting. 
Between me and my friends, we have a few items on the menu that we like, in summary is pretty much everything wrapped in bacon. 
Their pineapple is very delicious juicy and sweet. I can pretty much polish up one entire pineapple. However I probably need to take a break in between, just so that people other tables won't judge me or call me selfish. 
I would definitely recommend everyone in the neighborhood to try out this restaurant. But if you're coming from a different neighborhood, this restaurant is probably not worth the travel."}
{"text":"Been here twice with my husband and we really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. We've been to Copacabana, we were pleased to discover a restaurant similar to that near us. Staff were friendly, our servers were prompt and would regularly check on us. A lot of variety at the bar; roasted veggies are my favourite side to go with the meat. The garlic parmesan steak is awesome. Definitely a favourite of ours and pf course, the pineapple. The ribs I always found a little dry, but otherwise the food here is great."}
{"text":"I'm going five stars on this one!

First things first, this restaurant is huge! It boasts high ceilings, beautiful decor, unique wine concepts and a very, very large patio. Secondly, the service was phenomenal. Each staff member I interacted with was warm and friendly, answering all my questions and fulfilling my needs... er, my glass actually. 

I don't know how many times I tried the picanha but that was my favourite. Absolute favourite. Still salivating, actually. The pineapple was pretty delicious too. I didn't think I'd like it but I ate two big cuts of it. 

I'm certain I'll be back, especially for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Just been there for our office Christmas lunch today. Great service, our office love it. We love their food and salad bar. I had tried a similar style resturant in downtown for dinner montha ago, I have to say I like the one in downtown better because they have more choices. I am not sure if they would have more choices in the dinner too, I will probably find that out soon :)"}
{"text":"Probably more a 3.5 than 3, definitely not a 4 though. 

Came here with my girlfriend for my birthday dinner. First time being here, hearing all the hype kind of raised my expectations unconsciously. That being said, it was rather underwhelming. The temperature of the meat cuts were just a little above warm, but under the temperature I expected it to come at. The system's kinda cute, where endless rounds of meat keep coming.

The meats were all well seasoned, but the meats were almost all over cooked. The bacon-wrapped chicken breast was probably the worst. The chicken breast was so dry it flaked when I put my fork into it. The service and everything else were pretty decent. Still a good restaurant to sit and chat in."}
{"text":"The meat either comes out overly cooked beyond well done or overly raw. They have the oddest selection of meats that do not compare to another other place such as Copa Cabana. I told the waitress about the issue at hand. She was amazing very attentive to our issues. She tried to get us meat that was better cooked or at least medium rare. The pictures on their website isn't exactly what it is, and for the price you pay just go to the Keg and get a steak with lobster! I told them as I was leaving about not being happy even though I didn't fully eat I ended up spending 172 dollars for two people. They said let's bring the manager, they brought him over. I raised the issue with the manager who for such an \"elegant\" dining experience that it should be, is under dressed completely! He should of came to our table when we raised the issue to the waitress and she told him. There is absolutely no customer service or retention. At least at the keg you would spend no more than 120 and feel satisfied guaranteed!"}
{"text":"My soon brother in law has asked us to join him for the monthly game night before we came in for the holidays. All you can eat rabbits? bison? venison? and pheasants? Sign me up! Although I'm not much of a meat eater and I'd wayyyyy overeaten this holiday break, I made the exception to make belly room for this place. 

We arrived for our 8PM reservation but it took quite some time for the server and hostesses to clear/communicate/finally seat us to our table. In fact, we waited closed to 20 mins past our reserved time and had to ask the two hostess to check and double check what was holding up our \"5 more mins\" wait. When we were finally seated, our server was nowhere to be found. Each of us even attended the salad bar (1 on her crutches) and came back with a plate - yet no one had come by to ask for our drink order or give us the order card. I had to personally go back out to the front and inform the hostess once more/inform her of the situation. She apologized profusely and told us she would check for us again. After another 10 mins, our server finally appeared. Unfortunately, by then I had my bitch face on and I was no longer amused. 

We literally had to ask for each item one at a time - to a point I felt bad asking and re-asking. Water took 2 tries, tabasco sauce - 3 (I was half way through my meal by the time he was reminded again), refill on the fried banana - another 3. We actually had to specifically ask for the complimentary side dishes (fried banana, cheese bread, and yuca fries) or else they would had never been given. Our table watched him play with his Ipad on the side with another server for a bit while we had our hands up high hoping to get his attention. Definitely the worst service we had ever received in a steakhouse. 

The salad bar was not impressive at all. (To those who said it was a good selection - u guys must had never been to Fogo de Chao or Chima). Most of the veggies were never refilled. The best items were the smokey black bean and the raspberry sauce that accompanied the bacon wrapped turkey.  Everything else was pretty blend - which made it easy for me to focus on the meat (so glad I didn't go the Vegetarian option). 

The complimentary fried banana and yuca fries were delicious. The cheese breads were not as good as other Brazilian steakhouses' (not as chewy or sweet). I used to not be able to stop myself from munching away or overstuff my stomach with those - but at Touro, 1 had me saying enough. The yuca fries were not as heavy or dry as the ones I get from Peruvian chicken places. Dipping them into the raspberry sauce - perfect balance of sweet/saltiness. The fried banana had a nice panko tempura coating. We asked for at least 4 refills and I myself must had eaten at least 10. The sweetness of the banana really helped cut the saltiness/seasoning of the meat.

And onto the meat - we tried chicken drumsticks, rabbits, bison, pheasant, sirloin, pork rib, boar, steak rib, garlic steak, a few meats we could not for our life tell what the server was saying  (we asked them to repeat it at least 3 times to a point we were too embarrassed to ask again). There were some hits and misses. The sirloin was the least impression - even tho the piece we received was bleeding rare, it was the toughest chew of them all. My personal favorite ended up being the bison, chicken drumsticks, and rabbits. All three were seasoned perfectly - and I just like leaner meat to start with. We weren't given the bison until the very end right before the kitchen closes (we had to make a request to bring them out since the server never circulate to our table with bison or venison), wished it came to us earlier because after 3 bites, I couldn't finish my cut even tho it was sooo delicious. The chicken drumstick was the first item to be served at our table and it was never served again for the remaining of the night. The skin was crunchy and the meat fell right off the bone. The rabbits - tasted almost like white meat chicken but more tender, juicier and packed with flavor. 4 full rabbits in this belly please. Their famous specialty - grilled pineapple was extremely sour. The amount of brown sugar and cinnamon coated on top did not help at all. 

I ate and ate to a point I was reminded on how I felt after eating 5 bread baskets at Calle Ocho. If my fiance wasn't helping his mother on her crutches/wheelchair out the restaurant, I'm pretty sure he would had to carry me to the car. 

Quality + taste of meat + side dishes = 4 stars 

Disorganized management, uninterested service, and disappointing salad bar = 1 star

Price/value - the fact that we weren't served venison or given the option to try half of the meat items on the listed menu +  the kitchen closed on us while we were still sitting in the restaurant + about $50 per person = another 1 star 

Overall experience - 2.5 stars. 
Ate my rabbit worth but prob will never return again. Btw weren't we supposed to be given cotton candy at the end of the meal?"}
{"text":"This place is terrific when you have good service. Concept is terrific, meat can be ordered however you like, and buffet is solid."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and ambiance it's great; like a classy modern setting. It's comfortable and relaxing like a lounge. However it can get really loud. 

The salad bar decent, but the meat quality want the greatest. All the pieces were flavorful on the outside but tasteless on the inside and also dry and tough. The only thing I like was the sausage and Picanha.

Copacabana is way better in my opinion even though it more expensive."}
{"text":"What a concept!! About half the meat choices were outstanding. The others just felt like they were trying to serve every meat possible!  Love the grilled pineapple. I would like to have the option of the pineapple before the staff decide we are ready for \"dessert\". 

I found it really hard to have a conversation in this restaurant, as it was quite loud. Very expensive, and charged $2 pp as a cutting fee for a birthday cake. There were 40 if us! At $45+ pp, I thought they could wave the $2."}
{"text":"All you can eat meat. Touro is a classy place where you can indulge is delicious Brazilian steak dishes. The staff are friendly and seem to be enjoying themselves which in term makes you enjoy yourself! The meats are delicious with over 12 choices at dinner time! The Parmesan steak is a must try! The salad buffet was a little on the skimpy side. Although the meat compares to Copacabana, the buffet does not come close. The patio is beautiful in the summer! And their DJ on Fridays is a delight to listen to!"}
{"text":"Wow this is a great place. A huge salad and antipasto bar. Then followed by as much meat as you can eat. Flank steak top sirloin chicken grilled pineapple. On some Friday's and Saturdays they have live shows with dancers and performers."}
{"text":"The place to go if your craving all you can eat meat. I would not recommend going for lunch the selection is underwhelming. If your going here, go for dinner"}
{"text":"We went on a long weekend Monday so it was easy to get a table - typical ambience of the restaurants in the East Beavercreek area, which is good along with the good service from all the staff.

We were promptly visited by the servers with their large skewers and it's easy to say \"yes\" to everything that comes at first - tip: Take a look at the menu card on the table and give thought to what you want to try the most.  They'll come around again and again so you're guaranteed not to miss anything if you pass it up the first time.  

The meats are tasty but some did come out tasting a bit overcooked.  Anything with \"bacon wrapped\" tastes pretty darn good.  The garlic infused and the Parmesan coated meats are also unique and tastes good."}
{"text":"Wow. If any review for this place says the food is not great, they must be a vegetarian. Took my wife out for her birthday and we both loved it. You are paying a hefty sum for this but it is worth it. (Meaning come on an empty stomach.) 

They have a lot of options to choose from and they come by your table and offer them up fresh. I personally recommend all of the steak options and the pineapple I would kill for. 

They have an open buffet to cleanse your pallet but don't over do it with the salad and lobster brisk. Stick with the steak and enjoy. 

Steak, steak, steak. Did I mention the steak? 

Steak."}
{"text":"If you love meat, have a good appetite and a fat wallet then this place is for you. They have an amazing buffet which in most places would have been enough so don't get too much of it though, the coup d'gras is their delicious and well prepared meats.  Top sirloin, Parmesan steak, bacon wrapped chicken and about 9 more cuts of meat will put you into a food coma!

I passed on the chicken wings but tried the rest including the cooked pineapple.  The mussels from the buffet were equally delicious. The only hold back on a 5 star rating is the price. Adults were a flat $45 which isn't over the top given the cuts of meat but it did sting when you add in a few drinks, dinner for two was high for the atmosphere. Kids over 8 also paid adult prices, ouch!

We did leave feeling satisfied and for our large group of 18 the serving style meant we could all eat at the same time. Overall highly satisfied"}
{"text":"We so enjoyed this meal, the ambiance, the service, this was an excellent experience.  Would we go back?  Absolutely.  The salad bar was great, and the meat was amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to Touro for Baptisms, Bridal showers, brunch & lunch. I gave them 2 stars because the meat is REALLY good, I didn't give them 5 for a few reasons. Let's go!

1. $14.99 for kids brunch for 10 & under! REALLY?!? 7-10 ok, i get it, but kids 6 & under BARELY eat as much as a 10 year old does. My 3 year old doesn't eat anywhere near my 6 year old and he eats fairly little. It would be nice to see a few additions to the menu or 1-2 a la carte options for kids because to spend $30 + tax for a 3 yr old & 6 yr old are just insane when they eat literally 1 piece of meat, 1 piece of pineapple (sometimes) and 1-2 serving spoons of rice. My 3 year olds food should not cost half of what my meal is charged at. Come on can you really justify a 4-7 year old eating THAT much meat & food at a brunch buffet?!?! There are higher end buffet at hotels that charge upwards of $40 for adults and kids 5 & under are FREE! Hilton Suites, Sheraton Parkway and some of the upper scale hotels in North York/Toronto that we've been to where adults are $58 each.

2. Lunch there have many many times where we haven't been brought out 5 types of meat. Yeah we said something, and it's the usual \"sorry for your experience, we'll make sure to\" then i've already lost interest in hearing the same ol' line and having the same experience.

3. A lot of the meat lately has been pretty rare and then brought out too well done. What's happened? Oh yeah, i heard their main guy making the meats left Touro.

4. Sometimes it takes 10-15 minutes after being seated before one of the guys heads over to our table with the meats. They don't even look at us, they just beeline over to the larger group tables and then back to the kitchen. Once they are out again, they go back, finish up the larger parties and back to the kitchen. 

I wish they would bring back the bacon wrapped chicken at lunch instead of the chicken legs! It would also be nice to see the appetizer island items changed up a bit beyond grilled vegetables, beans, rice & what i think is supposed to be build your own salad.

I haven't been to Copacabana yet, but it is on my \"to do list\" of places to try out now that patio & bbq season is here. Stay tuned...."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to celebrate my birthday here because of the mixed reviews but I am so happy I did because the food and the customer service surpassed my expectations. 

Food: honestly if touro was closer to me I would come more often. Huge fan of the garlic steak, chicken and grilled pineapple. I was still eating when I was full because it tasted so good. The chimichurri, BBQ sauce and pico de gallo were the perfect accompaniment to the meat. I'm salivating thinking about it now. We had no complaints and the table just yummms and moans. 

Service: upon entering I was greeted by the manager xyla who showed me to the private room and promised me she would make sure my guest were taken care off. Luke was assigned to my dinner of 20. He made sure out drinks were always full and that the meat kept on coming. He did such a good job we gave him a round of applause at the end( I think we embarrassed him) . 

Atmosphere: the restaurant is beautiful and you can tell the designer payed close attention to details. Even the bathroom is gorgeous. 

Feedback: the only thing I would like is if the buffet table served steaming hot rice. Perhaps a rice cooker would keep it warmer than the trays because people kept leaving it open. I also loved the roasted veggies but they were all on the colder side. Maybe if they had antipasto style and hot roasted veggies that would be nice aswell. 

Without a doubt I will  be coming back for more. In the week they have a  seafood night so I definitely need to check that out."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner on a busy Saturday night with friends after agreeing we were all peculiarly interested in trying some Brazilian Rodizio-style barbeque.  Did not make reservations? No problem, the staff at the front were nice enough to let us sit and relax at the bar and wait for possible cancellations, which was indeed the case after about 50 minutes, an average wait time for a decent restaurant in this area!  Basically, we got here at 6:30 and by 7:30 we were seated and devouring, all without a prior booking arrangement.  I suppose we were just very lucky but I can't complain as the bartenders and hostesses were extremely nice and patient with us during the whole process.

Now onto the food.  Okay, so, as a medium-built guy I was told not to have anything before coming here so I had an empty-enough stomach to try everything.  Their salad bar / buffet station was a bit sparse but it is understandable at a place like this so I will consider it as non-eligible for review.  As for the meats, I was fairly surprised at how fast they were churning them out of the kitchen and bringing them to each table, as we were given about 2 hours we thought it'd be very long between each round but we were getting swords of steaks and bbq brought to our table every 5~10 minutes!  By the hour mark we were already turning our stickers upside down!

My friends and I shared different opinions about the taste of the various meats and steaks, but they concluded that some were salted a bit much (but I preferred a little salt on mine), and a few types of meats were a bit more well-done than medium or medium-rare.  However, we all concluded that the roasted cinnamon pineapple was perhaps the gem of the entire experience, I think several of us ate at least one pineapple by themselves!"}
{"text":"Came here for company Christmas dinner.

Meat was coming out faster than I could eat it.
The wings were the only thing I didn't get seconds on.
The grilled pineapple was really good, always a favourite at Brazillian steak houses.
Pesto sauce for meats was good.

I didn't understand the rage over the cheese bread, but i liked the deep fried banana.
Buffet table for salads, stews, soups, fruits, etc, had a nice selection.

Service was good.

Overall a good experience, too bad my appetite has shrunk over the year."}
{"text":"The selection of meats they have are outstanding. Every piece of meat is perfectly cooked and hot when it gets carved in front of you. Dinner is expensive so i reccomend going for lunch. There aptezier bar is very good aswell all around a amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night for an anniversary dinner.

Ambiance was gorgeous and looked very clean and spacious. Most of the meats were very delicious and nicely seasoned. The grilled pineapple is definitely a staple. I'm giving this place 4 stars because the cuts of meat would sometimes come too rare or too overcooked. The chicken wings were also quite dry and very salty. It would also have been great if the servers would offer to switch up the meat plates in the middle of the meal because the plates would end up being very messy near the end, which would make all the incoming meat seem unappetizing. Other than that, the food and service was great and I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"We went here for a birthday lunch. The place looked very upscale and very sophiticated.  The hostess and staff were very professional. I wouldve given this restaurant five stars, but the food was lacking.

Pro
Like i said the ambiance was awesome from the decor to the tables and chairs.  Staff was super and accomodating. One good example, were seated somewhere in the corner of the restaurant, so the servers with the meats were seldom passing by us. So we went a told our server that they need step up start bringing the food to our table. Within minutes we were bombarded with food, which was awesome service in my opinion.

Con
The food was so so, for the price we were paying.  The selection of meats were as diverce as other brazilian places ive been too.  Maybe it was our fault, because we came there for lunch.  Maybe there dinner selection is better.  But the prices wouldve been more expensive i would assume.


Overall
The experience was good, service and ambiance was awesome.  The food was just not there.  Ive been to other restaurants where thr food was good but service was horrible. To be a successful restaurant you gotta have both"}
{"text":"I have been to few Brazilian steakhouses before and my usual issue is that the meat is too salty. Here, I felt there was not enough seasoning. I spoke with one of the wait staff there and he indicated to me that finding the mix of  seasoning has been a challenge for the kitchen staff.  Other than that, the quality of the meat was pretty good. 

The buffet table offered various salad items and also some cooked items that were  tempting. 

The customer service here is top notched. The pace at which the food came was timed well. You had enough time to finish what you had on your plate before the next offerings of meats came. Also, once I made up my mind on what I like most, i was able to just ask the staff to bring me more of it."}
{"text":"Food pretty good but definitely not worth the price. All you can eat dinner = $50 before drinks or anything. Again it was fine but bang for the buck is simply not there. Maybe $30 or $35 but not 50... Customer service was fine and music was good."}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the better steakhouse in town with great service from the food server (not much from the hostess as we were ignored for about 5 minutes although we were standing in front of her and she didn't even greet us). 

Not cheap, but it's worth the $$ you're paying especially for the Parmesan Steak. 

The deserts are nothing special and not worth the money."}
{"text":"Touro had a great potential when it first opened up, to be the best Brazilian steakhouse in the city. Unfortunately, that fell short for so many reasons..

First of all, the place looks absolutely stunning, with beautiful set up and layouts, you can find tables for couples, small groups, big groups or even big parties...
Service is always on the A side, starting from the host, the servers and management, all seem to be very professional and welcoming.

The major con about this place is the food itself. It misses that unique taste of the Brazilian and Latin American cuisine. Compared to other popular restaurants of the same category, The difference is very obvious.

Also, The limitation of the items offered certainly make things that much worse.
They usually only have five or six cuts to choose from on a weekend evening for example, versus three cuts or so on a lunch period. While still charging the same price for similar restaurants, at $35-$45 per person, they still miss popular cuts such as fillet mignon Parmesan, Moroccan chicken, chicken Parmesan, prime rib cheddar, flank steak, etc...

It is too bad, because I said above service and ambiance is great, but the food can improve by a mile, which is an essential point for a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with a group of friends and am I ever glad we made a reservation, even the bar area was packed with people.  As Brazilian BBQ places go this place is pretty average.  The basic premise here is that the waiters walk around with various cuts of meat on swords, and as they walk by your table, you can indicate whether you want to try a piece or have them move on.  The variety of meats was decent, with various cuts of beef, lamb, chicken and sausage.  As can be expected most of the beef cuts were well done, but even considering that it wasn't overly dry.  My personal favourites of the night were the grilled chicken wings and the grilled pineapple. There is also a salad bar with cold and hot food.  The selection was minimal and fairly uninspired - something you can expect to find at a cheap lunch time buffet (mashed potatoes, meat balls, pasta, etc).  The service was pretty good and attentive, and they made sure that we had the cuts of meat we wanted.   Overall, it's a fun experience and if you like meat then this is definitely a good choice.  Although, for the price you can also go to a decent steak house to get your meat fixings."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to come with an empty stomach and feeling exceptionally carnivorous. The meat is tender and very tasty. My favourite part though is the pineapple. Definitely a great special night place."}
{"text":"Very good service and food. Servers kept asking what we needed and wanted to try Salad bar doesn't have that much to offer. Washrooms are very nice and clean. I went on a Tuesday evening so I can't imagine how busy it would be. A must try if you like all you can eat steak."}
{"text":"This review of Touro Churrascaria is on my experience for their patio, where there is an a la carte menu and drink specials.

Watching World Cup games and drinking $5 pint on Touro's patio might be one of the most enjoyable way to spend a sunny afternoon.

Patio is so spacious with a lot of different seating option for small or big groups. There is also shaded and sunny area if you are like me prefer to be in the shade but still enjoy some fresh air.

$5 domestic pint all day on the patio or daily specials $5 Sangria Tuesday, $5 Caesar Sunday and Caipirnhas on Sunday.. 

And for sure I will be back for some more World Cup action or just chill out with my friends at those comfy sectional loungers downing some Caiprinhas!"}
{"text":"The buffet selection is better than copacabana but the meat is not. They have so much meat selection but probably only tried 5 of them. They don't go to your table that much. Customer service is so so. Beef stroganoff is pretty good though. Not much desserts, nothing impressive really."}
{"text":"This place is such a disappointment.
1.Always seated late for our reservations.
2.Always rushed and told we have used up our time
3.The meat seems to stop after 10 minutes and we have to constantly ask for more ..
4.Small crowded and rude staff

I think it's way over priced and would rather go to Copacabana and pay the same amount of money for better service and atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place out for a while now, and finally did yesterday!

The restaurant is beautiful, it's huge and they decorated the place well. 

3 stars because the service is SUPER slow. Our waitress checked up on us a few times, however whenever we needed something, we had to get her attention. The meat hardly came around (even though we flipped the card to green, which was yes please). Made it a bit frustrating. 

However, the food was good. Don't recommend the sausage, it tasted horrible. However, their steak was amazing!! So was the pasta."}
{"text":"Party of 7 around holidays...

Awesome: Salad Bar, Customer Service, Atmosphere and Chicken drumsticks were nice and crispy. 

Not Awesome: Most of the meat was super dry, bacon chicken wrap was pretty bad, most food was quite salty, no desserts. 

Prefer Copacabana, meat quality and taste is way better."}
{"text":"From what I heard, the prices for Rodizio (all you can eat) from the restaurant opening to end of May was $39.75. The fixed prices are now Mon-Wed 39.75 and 43 dollars Thurs-Sun. Keep in mind, this place also offers A La Carte for those who aren't the all you can eat type.

Coming on a Monday night, it was pretty quiet so reservations I made were not needed.
Service was excellent throughout (the waitress even refolded my napkin as I left to grab appetizers).

The appetizers area is bigger than Copa Cabana's when comparing the two but nothing really stood out.

In terms of the meat cuts, there were equal amount of hits and misses. In terms of misses, I just felt like some cuts were dry and bland. Was looking forward for bacon wrapped filet mignon but alas, they had bacon wrapped chicken. They also didn't have cheese prime rib which is another favorite of mine.

Meat cuts were obviously different than Copa Cabana's but one major criticism is that I didn't understand or hear what some of the servers were calling out as they came to my table. Had to ask to repeat and it would have been better if they had a list of meat cuts like Copa has on their call card (card showing yes/no to serving)

All in all, I prefer Copa Cabana by a long stretch and I feel like it's more authentic there with occasional flamingo dancers and live music. Although my rating reads 4 stars, it's really a 3.5/5.

One cool thing about this place is the iPad wine menu and they definitely have excellent customer service. Very efficient and prompt staff. The dessert menu, not part of rodizio, looks really good too but I was too full to order anything."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Brazilian Steak houses and I have to say I really enjoyed my first visit to Touro Churrascaria. My girlfriends took me here for my birthday. Being a Monday night I was overly surprised that the place was busy (good sign). We decided to order a bottle of wine for the table. I was impressed that our wine list was handed to us on an Ipad. We were able to choose our wine based on world region. Very modern for today's society. Our waiter was extremely quick when bringing us our appetizers, (which other all you can eat restaurants don't do) cleaning our tables, filling our wine glasses and asking us if we needed anything else.

I enjoyed the atmosphere as well, very relaxing and comfortable, table were spacious and I was impressed that under the table there were hooks for our bags. the decor was different but very pleasing to the eye.

The menu options were incredible, I found great variety in the side table as well as the meat that was being served to us but the workers. I noticed they were very quick and a few times during dinner we had to flip our cards over not because we were full  but because they served us faster than we could eat :)

All in all I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"My review is based on our lunch Rodizio experience on a Friday. They offer all you can eat lunch for $25 Mon to Fri which is a great deal. There are fewer meat selections at lunch but it's still very good value. 

Selection includes:  Picanha, Top Sirloin, Chicken Wings, Garlic Steak, Leg of Lamb, Pork Ribs, Pork Sausage, Chicken Legs, Pineapple. And you get the self serve salad bar; and  unlimited warm and delicious cheese bread and deep fried banana pieces upon request. 
The steaks were well seasoned, good flavour; goes well with their hot sauce. We liked top sirloin, picanha, and lamb. Chicken wings were quite tasty too, didn't care much for the pork sausages. 
Grilled pineapple is a nice palate cleanser, very sweet and cinnamon-y. Too bad they don't offer ice cream at the salad bar, or that would go so well with deep fried banana pieces and grilled pineapple.
Overall, we had a great experience, well seasoned meats, good service, nice ambiance, clean restaurant. We would come back."}
{"text":"Located right by Hwy 7 and 404, Tauro (@tourosteakhouse) is basically steps away from where I work and yet I have never been. A few weeks ago, I was invited by View the Vibe (@ViewtheVibe) to a Media Tasting dinner.

I have probably pass by a million times but never would have thought how great it would look inside with the high ceiling and all the hanging lights.  I have only been to a Brazilian Style Rodizio (AYCE) restaurant once before but from what I remember there wasn't so many type of meat to choose from and the decor definitely didn't look as great.

I was early since the others had to travel up from downtown and I am glad for once it wasn't the other way around. I was quickly greeted by the owner/managing director and handed a drink by the gorgeous light-up lava rock bar.

Caipirinha
~ This is consider Brazil's national cocktail made with cachaça (rum made from sugar cane), sugar and lime. 
~ Love this simple cocktail with just the right amount of tartness and definitely needed it after a long day at work on a Wednesday.

The Appetizer Island
~ The Rodizo service also include a salad and appetizer buffet with over 40 dishes to choose from in-house baked bread, cured meats, cheeses to a vast array of salads and soup.

Brazilian Cheese Bread (Pão de Queijo) 
~ These were so good, it was more of a puff with air inside. 
~ Freshly baked in-house, these were so addictive and I probably end up eating 4-5 of them.


Touro's unique concepts offers the traditional Brazilian Steakhouse \"Rodizio\" service as well as A La Carte menu. The Rodizio feature continuous table-side service of 14 specialty cuts of meat $39.75-44.75pp (8 for lunch at $24.75pp).

Flip your medallion to green to signal the Gauchos to come to your table and start carving. Then just flip over to the red side if you need a break or ready to throw in the white towel.

 Choose from a wide variety of select cuts of beef, pork, chicken, lamb, seafood and the super delicious grilled pineapple which is simply coated with cinnamon and brown sugar.

 All the meats are slow-cooked over the charcoal open flame on the Churrasqueria  (Brazilian rotisserie style grill) 

Currently Touro is the only restaurant to offer this type of self-serve Enomatic wine lounge which enable guests to load a pre-paid card and choose fro themselves from their 24 selections.
~ They also offer Wine Tasting Nights two Tuesdays per month from 6:30pm to 9:30pm
~  Just choose 1 of the 24 wines, swipe card and press the amount of pour you want (1, 3 or 6 ounces) and voila, wine is being pour into your glass.

 A private room featuring a 17 foot natural slab table and may seat up to 20 guests including surround sound system and a 50\" TV with internet connections and enable full skype connectivity. 

They also have a semi private area that seats up to 60 guests and is section off from the main dinning room by a 6 foot tall banquette.

Too bad it was already so cold since they have a 3,000 square feet patio that can hold up to 150 people including a VIP Cabana where bottle service can be provided.

 I was surprise at how good their desserts was, especially the platter and I would gladly return just for desserts (^_^) Plus I saw that they have a Passion Fruit Mousse that I am desperate to try

Dessert Tasting Platter $20 (or $6ea)
~ Vanilla bean cheesecake with pineapple jelly
~ Warm apple crumble with caramel sauce
~ Chocolate cake with dark chocolate ganache & raspberry sauce
~ Coconut tart with fresh banana brulee

 Cake pop $10 (or $2.50ea)
~ Blueberry, Banana, Chocolate, Coconut and Apple

Mini Cup Cakes $10 (or $2.50ea)
~ Banana and caramelized pecans
~ Blueberry and line mascarpone icing
~ Chocolate, Buttercream
~ Coconut and caramelized pineapple
~ Spiced Apple with vanilla chantilly

Verdict :
~ Love everything from the cocktail, the meat and the desserts
~ I personally can't really seat the $40-45 worth but I would recommend coming in bigger group where you can chat, eat, drink, chat and eat some more.
~ Would love to come back for their A La Carte menu, enjoy some wine and their yummy desserts."}
{"text":"This place was disappointing for the price. The salad bar was a joke compared to other Brazillian Steak houses I've been to. The salad bar consisted of baked beans , Chili, nachos ......etc. and the portions were scarce .....Also the meat that was searched was way over cooked and dry. I have to admit that the lamb was good and some of the steak. There is also no dessert in the salad bar. 

I definitely would not recommend or return to this place....."}
{"text":"Okay you may have noticed that I post stuff about places that I either love or hate. As a bonafide self proclaimed foodie there is no middle ground for me. In the case of Touro there is absolutely nothing I can say bad about this place. I warn you in advance though; if you are a vegetarian, a vegan or any other type of egan that does not eat meat, pass on this review. For the rest of you, here goes.

We went here for lunch because a) it was cheaper and b) we wanted to go to someplace new. The place is huge with incredibly high ceilings and lots of lights in clusters. The staff is dressed very classy in all black dresses or slacks and they must pick them all for their dental work as they do a lot of smiling. For lunch they had 8 cuts of meat taken off the coals (yes coals, you can't get flavour like this from propane) on the skewer they are cooked on and brought to your table to be cut and served to you on the spot. You cannot imagine the smell of all this meat wandering around the place but I felt like a vampire at a blood bank. First up was the Antipasto Bar which included every type of traditional salad you could imagine as well as some you could not. The green and yellow beans and tomatoes in a feta cheese dressing were definitely of note. They also had two soups (Red Pepper was to die for), garlic bread and a collection of sauces which I assumed were for the meats. I grabbed the Hot Sauce, BBQ Sauce and the Chimichurri Sauce.

We flipped over our coasters to green, indicating we were ready for meat and along came a gentleman with a leg of lamb. Both of us being lovers of lamb we got a flew slices and began to chow down. Good Lord the lamb was done perfectly. I dipped a piece into the Chimichurri and the explosion of flavour was simply outrageous. The Lamb paired perfectly with this sauce. I was so impressed I did not even try the others until much later. We had sausage, three different cuts of beef and chicken as well. The meat came to us from crispy to rare all we had to do is pick the cut. All of it, top notch and definitely worth the price. I should also note that the little buns that they bring to the table are delicious. Warm, chewy and just perfect for soaking up juices.

The last item was grilled pineapple. Perfectly skinned, rolled in cinnamon sugar and grilled. The only thing missing was a scoop of ice cream.

The service was also exceptional. We were made to feel like we were most welcome and since it was our firs time there we were checked on from time to time to see if everything was to our satisfaction. 

All in all a spectacular lunch. 

Finally, the obligatory check of the washroom facilities to see if my son's wheelchair would fit in and indeed, they had one. It was spacious and private. The regular bathrooms were also private stalls. You don't see that everywhere."}

This place opened a while back and I've been there to catch up for drinks with clients off and on. 
I've had Churrascaria before and find that you need to bring an appetite - especially if it is good.
The wine choice is mainly Californian and they have a good selection of beers and whisky.
The buffet of appetizers is a meal in itself. Combine that with your meal selection of meats on a sword (plus a pineapple - go figure), you better not be calorie counting.
The meats are good...very good. Tender and cooked to perfection - not an easy feat when they are grilling by the yard length at a time.
Overall, it's a nice night out for business. I did not see many families there - maybe during the Sunday brunch it might be more conducive to kids.
Oh...yeah. Bring the wallet - it's pretty expensive."}

My personal trainer would not stop talking about this place so I finally gave in and tried it. I had no idea what to expect as I had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before. It was everything I could have wanted and more!!

You get this card which is green on one side and red on the other. Green means go and red means stop pretty much so if you're on green you will be approached constantly with different swords of meat! 

There are so many amazing options of meat, definitely something for everyone! Even my picky self tried everything except for the cheese one :p everything was fantastic!! I'd say my Favourite would probably be be beef ribs but everything is great and they come around constantly so don't worry if you didn't have enough of something you liked!

They also have grilled pineapple which they'll offer you while you're eating your meat and most people like to leave that till the end, but if you're anything like me you'll take it at any time!

I forgot to mention the salad bar they have! It's huge and there's lots of options of stuff to eat but try not to fill up on that because there's lots of meat to follow!!!!

I haven't tried any of their drinks except wine but they have their wine list on an iPad which you can order straight from there and it even lets you know whether or not they have that one in stock- pretty cool!

Service was also great! Staff are very informative and friendly, I even got one of the guys serving the pineapple to take a picture with my boyfriend :p

Overall both times I've been to Touro have been wonderful experiences and I would love to return :)"}
