{"text":"I was fully ready to come on here to write a bad review. We were seated for more than half an hour before the food finally came. It was a Sunday night and the place was mostly empty. We were just a party of two. When the food finally came, the waiter said the first burger was burnt so they had to redo it. Said they will take care of it. Not sure what he meant. 
Anyway, the burger was decent. Better than average but definitely not the best. We also tried the fish tacos. It was different and an interesting mix of texture and flavors. 
Not once did the waiter check on us. 
Finally when the time came to pay, he brought us our bill and we discovered that they had taken the burger off because it took so long. 
It wasn't a great dining experience until the very end, which was a pleasant surprise. We left a big tip. 
Might come back again to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"Awfully disappointed!

I went to this place expecting excellent burgers, given the name, the classy setting, and the prices... However, I was handed disappointment on a cold , boring looking plate!   I ordered the Kobe beef burger priced at $14 (no sides included) and the burger tasted like it was ground beef of grade A or lower mixed with a substantional amount of bread crumbs and spices to mask the mediocore taste of the meat. The burger was very thin and dry. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"One of my favourite \"cheap & cheerful\" dinner spots. Friendly, lively and consistently good without being expensive (which is what I think keeps the crowds coming). Beer selection isn't bad either. I'm quite surprised by the mediocre reviews! I've yet to have a less than positive experience here. 
If this place were located downtown, prices would likely keep me away - fortunately it's not downtown!"}
{"text":"Was going to try out Burger's Priest next door, but the lineup was crazy! We ended up coming here.
The burger I had with mushroom and BBQ sauce was really good! Sauce was smoky and sweet, patty was a bit dry but flavorful, wish they could let customer choose how we like the meat. My favorite dish was deep fried calamari, crispy and juicy. The sauce that came along was a perfect match!"}
{"text":"Lunched here on December 30. Cozy restaurant. Our server, a very nice lady with short dark hair, and an accent, seated us close to the roaring fireplace. My significant other ordered the original burger with a gluten free bun. The server didn't ask if there was an allergy or preference for gluten free (she should). The burger arrived with a regular bun. When we brought it to her attention, she confirmed that it was indeed a regular bun and that she should have caught the error. A few minutes later, she brought the correct burger back, which we suspect was the original burger transferred to a gluten free bun. Do not eat here if you have serious gluten allergies! I ordered the duck poutine with a Caesar salad. I asked for extra dressing tossed into my salad and was disappointed when the salad arrived barely dressed. The poutine was AMAZING with one exception: I found a bone in it. Overall, a cozy place, with decent food. And the server made a point of thanking us profusely when we were leaving. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Garlicky + yummy Cesar salad and steak/fries (blue cheese...mmmmmm) at the Burger Cellar yesterday.  A little pricey but you get what you pay for: great food, atmosphere and d√©cor - ex: fireplace (upscale but not intimidating), good beer selection + knowledgeable bar staff.  Their table service is terrific (love Barb - she always remembers customers' preferences).  Only downside - parking - but worth braving Yonge Street traffic to dine at the Cellar. Have eaten here several times (fyi - yummy Po-boy and sliders), as well as other local burger places - BC is best.  Nice touch: fresh apples as you leave."}
{"text":"Gave the restaurant a second try. This time ordered the DC burger Angus. As my last visit indicated that the burger was WAY over salted I asked the server to make sure they added zero salt. This time all of our burgers came out very juicy and not to salty. Sides were great and seasoned very well. 

Question to the restaurant.... If the beef you buy is HACCP Certified (HACCP is a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of biological, chemical, and physical hazards from raw material production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product.) why is it we can't get a rare or medium rare burger??? And why is it we can't get the lamb burger rare (it's not beef)? almost all reputable suppliers are HACCP Certified

We had the same server and she was still way overly personal. I can see calling us friends once but not every time she came to the table. I really dislike when servers use the words dear, pal, friend or even our first names if they don't know you. What ever happened to calling guests Sir or Mam?
Again she hovered over the table as the bill was payed by credit card."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Toronto - if you get the more expensive beef patty option. It was smooth, creamy, had great beef flavour - like some kind of salty chopped beef whipped cream. The bun was soft and pleasant and the veggie toppings fresh and crispy.

Sides were ok, good fries but not outstanding - its called burger cellar, not fry cellar.

The wine selection seemed good, but I drink beer. I had a Beau's."}
{"text":"Varied menu food is hit and miss, it can be great, other times Ho hum but I can't stand the TV commercials in the washrooms!
It is so evasive ."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice.

Food is okay.

A bit pricey. (Would it kill you to serve some fries with my burger? It's kind of ridiculous that I have to buy it as a separate side.)"}
{"text":"I came in for dinner with my friend on Sunday December 9th 2012, we were Served by George. Totally lost our appetite watching him flirt with his female colleague. There is a better time and place to be sleazy, while at work is not appropriate. Maybe he should focus all that energy on his job and you would be better off.  Referring to 30 something females as as girls is not considered respectful, retrain him. Never returning and telling my friends not to either."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in years! A little pricey so I like to consider going here as a treat. Yum!"}
{"text":"I was caught off guard a bit by having to order a side dish separately.  The crispy phyllo shrimp were delicious...although not so much phyllo as maybe panko crusted?

It's a bit noisy but the food was delicious.  Avoid the line-ups, make a reservation!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty weak.  My husband and I wanted something nicer than Burger Shack or Licks, so we headed here - after hearing mixed reviews (some raves and some rants) we figured we'd try it for ourselves.
We started with the french onion soup - it was not broiled long enough, so the top was only partially crispy.  The soup was cold, and since the cheese wasn't broiled properly, it was quite thick and hard.
My husband got a beef burger and wasn't overly impressed.  Said it was no better than a burger you'd get at a sub-par chain restaurant such as Kelsey's.  We shared onion rings and fries.  The onion rings were good, but far greasier than one would expect (and they were sitting in a pile of grease at the bottom of the bowl...seriously, the cooks couldn't take a minute to drain them first?)  The fries were cold.  The gravy served with the fries had a heavy alcohol taste to it, as though the cooks do not know how to reduce alcohol when cooking.
I ordered the grilled cheese.  It was actually very good - they give you two full sandwiches, which is way too much food, especially because it's incredibly greasy, but the taste was good. I stopped eating after the first sandwich, though, was too heavy to continue, and I was rather full.
We both decided that we would not return here.  The service was good, the ambiance nice, but the food subpar for the price we paid.  I have had better food at Licks/Burger Shack/Fat Phills!"}
{"text":"Although I have not done many reviews, after visiting this location I decided perhaps that is something I need to do more of. 

Originally my girlfriend and I walked into the burger priest which is located directly beside this location. Never eating at any of these locations, we felt the burger cellar looked much nicer, fireplace, dim lighting etc. A much more elegant look! 

We were expecting the high price tag when we went in there, so I won't deduct any stars for that. 

The food was horrible, definately not the quality you would expect from this price range. No fancy cups ketchup containers, or elegant environment could make up for that. 

The bacon was not cooked, fries are cheap McCain ones that were cold. 

All with a $30+ price tag! 

Save yourself the disappointment, and If you are craving a burger try the Burger Priest next door, which I will review shortly."}
{"text":"I wish I could give these guys more than 5 stars based on service alone. I came here based on my coworker's suggestion for Valentine's Day (girlfriend wanted burgers!), apparently this is my coworker's favourite burger place in the entire city.

We had a change of schedule so after a bit of a hectic start to the evening, we ended up coming here about an hour ahead of our reservation. The hostess graciously worked with us to find us a table anyways. We got the Valentine's Day special which was an amazing deal at about $50 for a 4 course meal for two (salad, coconut shrimp, burger and cake) that even came with a bottle of Beringer Pinot Grigio to share. I have seriously never seen a better deal than that.

Unfortunately, we were barely into our first glass of wine and our salad when my phone rang; my mother had been in a car accident, and needed my help immediately. I asked for take out as the waiter came to us with our plate of coconut shrimp, but instead of packing us burgers to eat cold later, he instead offered to simply comp the entire meal so that I could attend to this important family emergency. No hassle at all.

To say that I'm impressed with the service here is an understatement. I'm floored. I wish I had a chance to taste their food beyond just the salad, which was okay. I will be back...with more than big enough tip to make up for the graciousness shown by the staff at the Burger Cellar today."}
{"text":"Best Burger in town!

Had the Kobe Hog Town burger last night. The burger was cooked to perfection with incredibly fresh toppings. Ordered the salad instead of the regular fries and it was fresh with a really great dressing.

Service was quick and polite. Atmosphere was funky and comfortable. Location was easy to get to from the subway.

I will be making this a regular spot from now on."}
{"text":"8 of us were wandering Yonge St. looking for a place to eat after an event and we came upon Burger Cellar. Although it was busy on a Friday night, we only waited about 10 minutes for a table. Service was excellent and server recommended the pork side ribs (new and not yet on the menu) We weren't disappointed. The flavour and tenderness were perfect! My husband and I shared a full rack which came with very good fries. We also shared a full size caesar salad. We were both stuffed! Our friends had various burgers and said they were really delicious. Place was packed with families and couples enjoying a night out. Ambience was upscale, prices not over the top, and service was excellent. We will return!"}
{"text":"Always great burgers, consistent and friendly service. They remember people from the hood and appreciate it when you come back. Seriously consider the burger special and always duck poutine"}
{"text":"I got the Hog Town Burger that has aged cheddar and applewood smoked bacon. In my opinion it was bit above average. They do make it fresh - at least they make it taste it like it. But I am saddened that it didn't come with sides. 

The restaurant looks very nice, fancier than expected. Service was good. 

Decent pricing and would come here again to try the bison patties."}
{"text":"Coming here the first time and did just because of the reviews here on Yelp.

Ordered the Tomato Caprese soup which was the soup of the day and by far the best dish there - must have if you like to have a soup before a burger 

Then we ordered the duck poutine and it was okay - salt overload! I like the concept and would definitely try it again hoping they would make it better next time

They we order the BCB Angus burger which was good - burger with onion ring on it and chipotle BBQ sauce - the patty was done well - would like to try the bison one next time.

Ordered the onion rings and the sweet potato fries on the side and by far the best onion rings I have had in a long time! They were so crispy - I couldn't differentiate the batter and the onion. Highly recommend!

The service was excellent - forgot to ask the gentleman's name (he had a goatie and he mentioned that he had been working there ever since they started). He knew every ingredient in the soup and the burger - which isn't difficult but he made us at ease. 

Overall ratings
Food - 3.5/5
Service - 4.5/5
Money's worth - 3.5/5
Ambience - 3.5/5

Would definitely recommend this place for bite!"}
{"text":"I have heard very positive reviews of The Burger Cellar and my boyfriend and I had to check it out for ourselves. We were not disappointed. We were greeted by fantastic staff and an awesome burger menu. We started with a few apps - pickle fries were my fave and we had the turkey burger (ask for caramelized onions on top too!) and the original burger. We will definitely be going back. 

Tip - order The Burger Cellar Caesar."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant through my boyfriend and immediately begged him to go. I was not disappointed! The first time i went we ordered the Ahi Tuna tacos, they were quite small yet soo mouth-wateringly delicious especially the wasabi sauce that went with. Along with the tacos, the duck poutine was intriguing and so that too ended up on our table. We decided to pay the extra $3 for the truffle oil and although the poutine ended up costing around $14 it was well worth it. This poutine rocks! it has this certain umami, decedent flavour that is irresistible and crave-worthy. I have also had the mini sliders and their original BCB burger which was good but i think I'd come here just for the two appetizers i drooled over in the beginning of this review. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food and great service! We went there for New Year's Eve and they say us right away, no wait (only for 2) and they were super busy. The burger I had was one of the best I've ever had. I got the duck poutine as a side and it was amazing. The waiter was so friendly! The staff came up to us a few times to ask how we were doing so we never without. We will definitely be coming back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Accidentally found the Burger Cellar on a trip down Yonge north of Lawrence. Hard to miss from the outside this is hardly a cellar - in fact it is at street level and if it were in the basement you would be run over by the suwbay that rumbles beneath. Sure much of the interior wall space and ceilings are black but there is a fireplace and bar TV's in a fairly well lit with simple comfortable furniture and lots of wood. 

More of a cozy kid friendly atmosphere, but the wine rack and listing try to make it more sophisticated as do the various higher end toppings like truffle aioli and avocado.  The menu seems to clutter all of this together which is confusing.

The burger is 7oz and is of the flat and wide variety which is great because toppings stick better as does the large fresh bun. Bacon is thick strip and apple cider smoked - two huge strips more than cover the burger (I broke them in half for better coverage). I also appreciate a burger restaurant that offers a fried egg as a topping - all additional toppings are $1 which encourages creativity and calorie consumption. 

Burgers come a la carte which is fine - share some sweet potato fries or a side of mac and cheese or fried pickles with their homemade ketchup and you've got a large meal. No need to be tempted by apps or some sort of chocolate burger dessert. 

And of course there is a decent selection of wine - 3oz glasses are only $3 to $6 and 6oz double the price. Something about eating a large juicy burger with bacon, egg, onion, lettuce, tomato and aged white cheddar and washing it down with a Malbec makes for a less greasy experience. Don't worry I don't strive for this type of burger experience - my review of the Burger Shack and Dangerous Dan's are coming soon. 

Btw - service seems to have improved. If you read other sites about the recent opening most patrons were angry about the waitstaff."}
{"text":"Maybe a little confusing with its image, a burger wine fine dining experience? Or a really good real-home-made burger with a rich chocolate ice cream shake to wash it down?

On one side it feels like u should come in a suit, the other like it's where your buddies should meet up on the weekend. Regardless it's great food."}
{"text":"Not great!!  We were expecting a phenomenal burger, what we got was just ok!  The angus burger had no taste!  Was dry!  And the fries were cold and soggy!!  Not going back!!"}
{"text":"I normally dont dine here an usually just purchase to go; since they now support grab an go food, the location is great an setting is nice an roomy; quality an price is normal an expected; food portions could be a little bigger."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Went on Saturday night after 9:00pm. Ordered their special featured - lobster bisque and cameral milkshake for $5.00, our favorite dish - duck poutine and a pint of Guinness for $5.00 after 9:00pm on Friday & Saturday.  

Lobster Bisque
Surprisingly delicious! Hot, flavorful with bits of lobster and snow crab meat.  

Duck Poutine
This was our main purpose to visit The Burger Cellar, not for their burger, but duck poutine!  Taste is as good as we remember and the duck meat is tender.  The only down side is that the dish wasn't hot enough... it was edible and we didn't want to waste food, so we didn't ask the server to remake it...

All and all is pretty good, will come back just for the duck poutine and lobster bisque."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with my family. Duck poutine was amazing. Burgers were ok. The service was dismal. Staff were uncoordinated, bumping into each other all the time, asked us to put our own drinks down on table as server didn't use a tray. (Not a biggie as a stand-alone although with all that happened .. Not cool.) Then another server smacked the heavy poutine plate on my hand telling me to move. Why she was carrying two when as she said they're very heavy I don't know. The staff were seemingly rushed off their feet. We'd be talking to our waiter and in mid-conversation he'd just disappear. It happened a few times. I love the poutine although I'm now going to find another burger place. This was not an enjoyable or relaxing meal."}
{"text":"Yummy burger! One great thing about this restaurant is the variety of different burgers that sound delicious. Usually I can narrow down what I want on a menu quite quickly, but there were at least 4 that I couldn't decide from.

Unfortunately, the service was really lacking. It took at least 10 minutes to get a glass of water. The waiter was disgruntled and aloof. At the end of the meal, he made us feel bad when we had to send the bill back twice for corrections. He grabbed the receipt out of my friend's hand and offered to take a side off the bill, but he made it seem like he was doing us a huge favour and putting him out for asking for a correct bill!"}
{"text":"Looks like I'm not the only one who stumbled upon this place due to Burgers Priest a couple of doors north being unavailable. I stopped by with my friend around 9:30pm last Thursday to quell a hankering for a juicy burger at BP only to encounter a locked door and a carboard sign out front that read SOLD OUT. 
SOLD OUT??? 

We didn't have much choice but to settle for Burger Cellar--this, just after walking past it and going, 'Who would come here for a burger when there's Burgers Priest next door?' I would, that's who!

We shared the fried calamari ($9) which sat in the fryer for so long that the outer layer was crunchy like Ruffles and the squid rings were chewy like Gummi Bears. 

My bud ordered a Kobe beef burger of some kind ($14) which was small and hardly discernable from a regular burger. For each of their burger options, one has the choice between a regular, natural (natural what?), and Kobe patty. Unless the Kobe is a slab (not ground) of Wagyu beef, how would one even know that they're really getting Kobe meat?? This one was not shaped like it was fresh/made in-house, and was overcooked to the point of denying one the joy of eating a burger. You'd think with a name like Burger Cellar, they'd at least get that right!

He also got a side of deep fried Kosher pickle (3 quarters for $3) which he seemed to like. Until I had a bite of one, I always believed you could bread and deep-fry anything and it would taste like heaven, but after trying it, I could hardly figure out why someone thought this was good enough to include on a menu.

I ordered the chicken club sandwich ($11), even though I was thinking I really need to eat healthier if I am to eat so late at night though I tossed that idea out when I was reminded that my original aim was to have Burgers Priest! I was expecting a double-decker sandwich, which I thought was how the club sandwich worked. Instead, I got a small piece of chicken that would have fit better on a slider bun, in a small bun that was too big for the meat which made it annoying and messy to eat. It tasted OK (thanks to the chipotle mayo) but had I known I wasn't getting the two-tiered sandwich, I would have gone with something else. It was nothing special.

Service was meh, and there were crumbs all over the table and seats. There was a game on that night and even though there were maybe ten diners, it got pretty loud thanks to two guys who were really into the game. It seems like a family kind of place that becomes a sports bar on game night. The overcooked food was a tad overpriced, especially considering the size of the burgers and sandwiches, and they don't come with fries or anything. Not exactly a winner."}
{"text":"Terrible. 
Went here for father bday and the service was terrible. 
No appetizers with the overpriced burgers."}
{"text":"Really tasty burgers!!  I Went here yesterday for the first time and I got a CD'S burger I don't remember the whole name but was new in the menu and a side of hand cut French fries .. The presentation was nice and I think it's the best hamburger that I've ever tried so far !!  Also I got a brownie for dessert and it was delicious too ! Very satisfied with everything and the place is really beautiful to be a hamburger place ..  I'll definitively be back :)"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 4 star but I'm sorry my food was super-loaded with sodium (aka salt). Why so much salt??? These restaurants are killing us!
After a two-week cleanse my palate is very sensitive to salt and such. If you love your food with lots and lots of salt....go here....you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Have to say, I was completely blown away by Burger Cellar, partially because I had heard such mixed buzz. It's right in my neighbourhood, and my parents are fans, but every time I considered it I checked Yelp and changed my mind.

Finally ended up going for dinner last night with my boyfriend and brother. We had a reservation for a 7 o'clock table which I might not have thought necessary, but our server told us that they fill up almost every night.

Service was impecable - we had Curt and he was smart, friendly with suggestions, had great answers to questions and didn't bat an eye at variations. When I asked if I could have my burger cooked under med-well,  he explained the Ontario laws (they don't grind in house) but told me he'd ask the kitchen to go as low as they could, and sure enough it came out beautifully juicy.

We shared pickle fries to start, which I loved. The sauce was good but I might prefer something a little thin/easier to dip into. For mains brother and I both had beef burgers, he the Hogtown (bacon and cheddar) and I had the Alan's Famous (incredibly good blue cheese and deliciously sweet cooked down onions.) I added bacon.  Boyfriend had the turkey burger done up with all the traditional toppings of their BCG burger. It was so tasty.  

My brother and I both chose the Angus Beef for our burgers, and for those who are complaining that Kobe wasn't worth it - I might say you're right. Angus has great flavour and marbling which gives it a solid fat content, and luckily theirs is hormone and antibiotic free. I didn't ask, though I'm sure the server would know but I skipped the upgrade to the natural cause a) the Angus sounded natural enough for me and b) the natural is likely grass-fed beef, which although nice in certain circumstances, lacks the meaty oomf I look for in a burger.

Sides were the duck poutine and the onion rings, and although the poutine is pricey it is so rich that the shared portion was tough to finish, and so good. Onion rings are also made fresh to order, and are super delicious and totally ungreasy.

All in all, we had an amazing experience. I love the Burger's Priest - to compare them may seem like an obvious choice, due to logistics, but the fact is I'd choose them for completely different reasons. For an amazing sit down burger with high quality ingridients and customizable choices, check out the Burger's Cellar.

Dinner for three with tax/ and generous tip ~ $80."}
{"text":"I really like the burgers here. I love that they offer a selection of meat (regular, natural and Angus). It's great to be confidant in the meat source at a restaurant. Fries are in-house, side salad of spinach is extra yummy with their spicy pecans, beer is craft- local. They clearly care about where food is sourced."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. My bf and I went on a Sun evening and it was quite busy and lively. The hostess led us to our preferred table and the waitress was attentive and engaging, checking in on us in a non-intrusive manner throughout our dinner.  
She also made recommendations for picking the dairy-free bun for our burger vs the gluten-free and whole wheat ones and she recommended to pick one order of the duck poutine as she noted it is quite a large serving. As it turns out she was right.  The duck poutine was enough for the two of us although the the dairy free bun didn't live up to the hype.  Frankly, I should have asked for a lettuce wrapped burger but opted not to. It would be nice if that was an option. 
More on the duck poutine....whoever thought of mixing pieces of duck with fries, cheese curds and gravy deserves some sort of culinary award as that mix of disparate flavours hit my pleasure centre all at once. 
The burgers themselves were tasty enough, done to our specifications, but a tad overpriced. 
However, the Muskoka Milkshake, which is a chocolate milkshake with dark rum and Kahlua topped with whipped cream and chocolate bits, was the essence of decadence. Divine!  Highly, highly recommend it! Worth every cent. 
So customer service was above average, and appetizers and drink/dessert were outstanding. Burgers were tasty but didn't stand out from other gourmet burger competitors."}
{"text":"Originally I was planning to try out Burger Priest next door, but the line was way too long and I was in a rush. The Burger Cellar didn't look too shabby with a nice open patio and the weather was just too nice to resist! 

Upon opening the menu, I noticed that the burgers here are on the pricey side. When you order the burger, you're really ordering just a burger. Any sides like sweet potato fries and fries were at additional cost (first time seeing this). The waiter didn't tell me my chipotle mayo for my sweet potato fries were $1.75 extra until I saw it on my bill.. 

I tried their Turkey Burger and it was served open-faced and the ketchup, mustard and relish were on the side for you to smear on yourself. You can choose from white or whole wheat bun, and it was nice and soft. The patty was thick and juicy, the lettuce and tomato were also fresh and crispy.

For over $20 per person wanting a nice burger, this place is over priced for what their calling \"gourmet\". 

Would not return."}
{"text":"Imagine if it really was a burger cellar though? Like instead of wine, you went downstairs to this climate controlled room full of burgers? Can we make this happen?"}
{"text":"So I decided to go here because it was something simple and close by.  This isn't your typical burger joint.  Inside you walk in where it is modern looking, good for families and also a small bar area for those who want to just be casual.  Their menu is very casual being 2 sided and folded four ways but sideways.  One side has the appetizers and desserts and the other is the main menu with the burgers and wine selection.  

The burgers themselves range from AAA beef to regular to kobe beef, with kobe being the most expensive.  The prices are expensive and they do not come with a side dish.  So those are extra and range from $2-6.  IMHO, the burgers weren't all that great and weren't worth the price.  I shared the onion rings and they tasted very bland almost like there was no seasoning added to them.  

Anyway we decided to share the cheesecake bun, which was some gooey cheesecake in between 2 smaller version of a Krispy Kreme doughnut.  This was for $6 and was thoroughly disappointed.  All in all, with tip it came out to $54.  I just personally thought the food wasn't worth it at all.  As much as we had though a burger and wine combo is an interesting theme, the items were rather disappointing."}
{"text":"I was here in October 2011 for their One Year Anniversary Party. My friend Calvin maintained that this place had the best burger in Toronto and I must say it was quite delicious. 

I got the \"Hogtown Burger\" if my memory serves me correctly and quite enjoyed it. It is a very different kind of burger than the much famed Burger's Priest which at the time was only in the Upper Beaches area of Toronto - they've since opened a location literally a couple doors away from The Burger Cellar - but I don't know if I would rate it better. As well, at the time I went to Burger Cellar it had been almost a year since my one and only trip the Burger's Priest in the Beaches so I had, obviously, built it up in my head a bit.

As well, I shared with Calvin the huge Duck Poutine which I recall finding to be quite delicious. On the expensive side at $11 but the portion was large and, like I said, it was quite tasty.

The Burger Cellar is definitely a way different kind of place than the Burger's Priest. Burger Cellar is a combination wine bar-burger joint and it shows through in its ambiance. Burger Cellar is way more of a sit down kind of place with plenty of seating in their dining area, a wait staff, and a full bar area which is where we sat and had our food so I can't really comment on the wait staff.  

The prices are also bigger at Burger Cellar versus a standard burger joint but in a way they have the options available to justify it. Each burger can be ordered as a \"AAA Black Angus\", \"Natural\", or \"Kobe\" with the pricing ranging from $8 for the cheapest burger as AAA Black Angus to $17 for one of the two most expensive burgers as Kobe.

I would very highly recommend this place as a great date location as it is quite classy and they take their wine very seriously while still being a relaxed burger joint type atmosphere."}
{"text":"A spacious place with a very welcoming sort of atmosphere. Not too busy on a Sunday night but with just enough people around to make you feel excited about the burgers. Being named for burgers, we didn't try any of the other food options. 

Been warned: the servers may not actually ask which of the three levels of burger you want (3 different price ranges) and we were defaulted the medium priced one. I don't complain because in the end the meat was delicious and the server was otherwise friendly and attentive. 

Burgers do not include sides automatically, sides are added on separately costing $5-8 extra."}
{"text":"Everything here is good. Stellar wine list, great burgers. But they also have fish, chicken, lamb. The staff is awesomevand makes you feel welcome. Whether alone or in a group, this is the place in the Yonge-Lawrence village!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that my waitress was a dream, and this review is no reflection of her brilliant effort.

There menu reflects their position as a specialty burger restaurant, with various bun options (including lettuce or gluten-free), various grades of beef for your patty and a plethora of topping options. Sides must all be ordered separately, as do non-standard condiments. 

I ordered a \"Natural burger on a lettuce \"bun\"\". I forget exactly what the menu item was called, but it had onions and goad cheese. On the side came a dish with ketchup, mustard and relish. While the burger was good, the patty was a very modest portion. I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries, and the waitress suggested I get the aioli to go with it... I thought the aioli would be nice to have in case I wanted to try it, but I knew I wouldn't really use it. Overall the food was good. I've had better.

It wasn't until the bill came that my sense of horror sunk in. Everything was itemized: $14 for the burger, $5 for the sweet potato fries AND $1.50 for the tiny little blip of aioli (which I hardly touched). With tax and tip, my little burger lunch was $26! I drank water - imagine what it would have cost had I ordered a soft drink, or God forbid as the name of the restaurant would suggest, WINE!!!

All in all, the meal was good, but the check left me with a foul, rotten taste in my mouth that I will never forget."}
{"text":"This was disappointing.  And to think I turned down the Priest next door to give this a go.  I tried the BCB burger, sweet potato fries, and Asian slaw.  Everything was overpriced and mediocre.  The burger was too well done and the toppings were uninspiringly boring in the way they fit together - onion ring and bbq sauce.  It felt like they were still experimenting because it just didn't come together nicely the way a good burger should.  The fries were also excessively salty, I had to wake up in the middle in the night to chug water, and the slaw was flavourless.  For the pricing and location, I really was hoping for more.  The beer list was also too standard.  I was hoping for some more creative options there as well.  Honestly, I'd rather hit McDonalds across the street before coming back here."}
{"text":"First, the ambiance is very good for a burger bar.  It's a great place to bring the guys and watch sports and/or kids.  Feedback: the glass from where we sat blocked the TV.  If there are sports on, I have an obstructed view.  Also, why are there coasters in the lighting?  haha

Service: solid.  Nice people.

Food: My wife & I shared a burger & duck poutine.  The duck poutine was good as was the burger.  What prompts my low food ratings is the temperature.  It just wasn't hot when it got to our table.  A poutine should be steamy hot, and the burger sizzling.  Ultimately, I'm hoping they make this improvement.

If we were in the area, we'd come back.  But it's pricey."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere,...when there's no kids around. Not sure what is up with this recent trend of these parents brining their toddlers and young children to a bar? Not liking it. Anyway this place has a very nice feel and is actually quite relaxing. Love the decor. Awesome selection of on tap beer and wine plus the burgers aren't bad either. Actually the burgers are quite awesome indeed!!! Quality ingredients such as AAA angus, prime beef and certified organic bison if you dare. My wife and I like to go there on weekends, just wish they were open later and the kids stayed at home. Psst parents, go to McDonalds, it's across the street and let the adults enjoy their time.

2016.10.01 UPDATE: Lately we've noticed the level of service at this restaurant on the decline.  The last order was messed up pretty badly. And yes to the managements credit they did amend the order/situation very quickly BUT only after we brought it to their attention. New staff I'm finding are unpolished, rude and don't listen!! Used to be our go-to-place but not anymore. Rating reduced from 5/5 to 2/5! 201"}
{"text":"Went to the Burger Cellar with my friend Vanessa yesterday.  Admittedly, this was completely due to the fact that we had meant to go to Burger's Priest - and it was closed.  Who knew they would be so serious about going to church? 

But it turned out to be a happy change in plans, for the food was delicious.  The service was, as many have mentioned, hit or miss.  And in my pros and cons below, I'll outline that.  

Pros:
- good selection of food without being overwhelming.  I prefer a one page menu in burger restaurants, but one page two-sided was also reasonable.  

- doing burgers to order.  This needs to be done in EVERY burger restaurant that isn't fast food.  I've had to sign a LEGAL WAIVER before, when asking for my burger to be cooked to medium.  No fuss here, I asked for medium, I got medium.  Simple.

- the food was hot and delicious when it arrived.  I ordered the BCB (2 year aged cheddar, bacon, sauteed mushrooms, and housemade BBQ sauce) with fries, and my friend ordered The Hog Town (white cheddar with bacon) and a side mac and cheese.  My burger was juicy, seared wonderfully on the outside and perfectly seasoned.  The fries were crisp and had a seasoned salt on them.  Her burger, while tasty, she agreed would have benefited from being cooked to medium as well.  Her mac and cheese was the perfect size, seasoned well, and had an amazing FOUR cheeses.  Mein got.  

Cons:
- the price in these higher end burger joints is getting ridiculous, especially since they all choose to be \"a la carte\".  For two burgers, one side of fries, and one mac and cheese?  $46 after tip.  We didn't even order drinks!  My friend pointed out that we're paying for a small patty of ground beef.  No matter how delicious, is that really worth $12 or $14?  

- the lighting in the place was awful.  As the Sun went down, the lights didn't brighten.  We're not in a romantic, fine dining establishment.  It's a burger restaurant.  

- the service was unfortunately pretty bad.  We were quickly seated, and initially quickly greeted by our waitress.  But it went downhill from there.  It took far longer than expected to get our water, and the refill of said water took even longer than that. There also was the confusion of no less than three different wait staff checking in on us.  Why don't they have a proper table system?  And last, we waited at least 10 minutes or more, with empty plates in front of us, for someone to ask if we were done.  Wait staff would literally walk a couple feet in front of us, without ever glancing down.  

In conclusion, the restaurant should take note of all the reviews that mention how sub-par the service is.  The food was amazing, the burger easily made my top ten in the city.  But bad service will often keep people away, even if your food is perfect.  The Burger Cellar could definitely be one of the cities best burger restaurants, if they tweaked a few things mentioned here, and in the reviews of others."}
{"text":"Fairly standard burgers, nothing too crazy or exotic that sets them apart from other burger restaurants. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and decor but for a place called burger cellar I expected a bit more exotic/different burgers from the menu."}
{"text":"So, being the idiot that I am, I planned a trip to Burger's Priest on a Sunday, and lo and behold they were closed for church. SO i defaulted to going to Burger Cellar which was right next door. I forgot the exact burger I ordered, but it was ok, typical burger with extra fix ins. I also got the beer battered onion rings, which really just tasted like normal onion rings, didn't really taste the beer battered-ness of it. I also ordered a spike milkshake which tasted like apple pie and quite delicious. Overall pricey for an average burger, and there seemed to be a lack of attentive customer service (bartender doubles as waiter, and the 2 waitresses are typically bustling in and out of the kitchen without really stopping to look around). Milkshake was delicious though."}
{"text":"The staff here were super friendly and attentive until the restaraunt started to fill up...then service got pretty slow and it felt like we waited forever to get the bill.

The pickle fries were good but I found I could only eat two and then it just became too much dill...dill pickles in dill breading with dill sauce...come on, get a little more creative then that please.

The veggie burger was disgusting in my opinion...it was a bunch of random crap pressed together with curry spice and then fried, but the isnide of the patty was mushy and curry flavored. The waiter even tried to warn me against getting it but there was no other veg option.

Drink were good but pricey, overall a very \"meh\" experience."}
{"text":"Let's just say, we wouldn't have come here if Burger Priest closed early because they sold out of hamburgers.

I had the mushroom Kobe burger ($17) and it was definitely not worth the money! The most expensive burger I've ever had. The patty was cooked just right, however the meat was not aged. It was tasteless and not seasoned. 

Oh, you have to pay for your condiments and sides. I got  pickle fries ($3) and the batter did not stick well (probably didn't dry the pickles prior to batter). My friends added duck poutine ($11) with their burger and portion was generous (can share with 2 people). I thought the duck poutine was good but nothing special.

Would I come again? No! I would pay any amount of money for good food, but this was not even worth the money because South Street Burger and Hero Burger is better than this joint. 

Yes, you get a nice atmosphere but that's all you're paying for."}
{"text":"Late service; kids meal was the last!!! Forgotten extra ordered toppings for burger; a rotten lettuce on a $18 burger..."}
{"text":"My kids love this place.  Very family friendly - paper/crayons for kids, kids menu, desert, etc.  

Good beer/wine selection for grown ups.

Food is good, not amazing, but solid.

Service is always super friendly.  Everyone genuinely seems to enjoy working here...which is hard to fake.  

Recommend, especially for families."}
{"text":"Unfortunately all of our burgers were overcooked and dried out - we ordered the prime burgers - the most expensive on the menu. Service was very good but the food was mediocre except for the brownie we had for dessert - that was pretty good."}
{"text":"Modern interior with lots of rooms for you , service is friendly and great and the food......spectacular . We had chicken wings and house soup as an appetizer both very decent. And we went for the special burger of the night which was capres which balsamic and pesto aioli ...  I tend to not eat bread so they offered lettuce wrap... They also have gluten free buns if you're interested.... The best burger that I had in Toronto do far...highly recommended and I'll go back for sure"}
{"text":"I remember when it first opened I walked in and was horrified by the prices they were charging.  I nevertheless ordered a burger and some onion rings and remarked that I was sure the restaurant would be closed in a week.  I had food poisoning.  They remain open.  I guess they had the last laugh."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some priest....however it was sunday....so right next door is the Burger Celler....Was greeted by the server who happens to be the chef as well....Made a great recommendation and also knew his brew as well...For a burger joint ...this will be one of the better ambience there is...Burger was well done and rich in flavour....however with the priest next door...I dont see myself there that often...but glad i tried it out."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. The burgers are good and you can order a $380 bottle of wine with your $10 burger if you choose.  The place is confused. Its a sports bar wannabe fine dining atmosphere that serves burgers.  The service was slow and it took forever to get our drinks....and we only ordered shots of vodka.

If you want a good burger with crappy service....go here.  Drink some fine wine while you are at it as well."}
{"text":"The side of Mac and cheese is delish. I had a burger with blue cheese and Carmelites, spicy onions, also good. The burger was a little dry, but had great flavor. My sweet potato fries were a bit salty (I liked). The onion rings were homemade and the size of a necklace. Although I did not try it, the calamari went quite fast on our table. Tuna tacos were lacking a bit in meat and flavor. My favorite part of this dinner was the Caesar drink. Like an American Bloody Mary, but lighter and quite wonderful (not a Bloody Mary fan). The most unique thing about this restaurant is pairing a juicy burger with wine!"}
{"text":"Meh - 
we made a reservation on open table - they didn't have it on file (had to show them the confirmation) - not a big deal they sat us pretty quickly.  Reasonable selection of wine and drinks.  

We all had burgers... I had the angry something and it was great I upgraded to the bison (though 18 dollars is a steep fee for a burger without fries).  My wife had the veggie burger which tasted more like an extremely thick falafel not bad but not a burger.  

The sides... Great selection but we all ordered something different and they left a lot to be desired.  The pickles fries are just giant pickles (I was expecting them to be fry size) and battered and fried, they are a novelty but not an especially tasty one.  I got the regular fries which were soggy.  My mom had the sweet potato fries which were nothing special.  

All in all a great burger - but for the price I think you can do much better in city.  Also - there were a lot of families so maybe it's better for that.  The server was attentive and the food came out quickly.  

But - 4 dollars for soggy fries on top of an 18 dollar burger?"}
{"text":"I'd heard that this upscale burger joint not only makes a proper burger, but also a great poutine. I ordered the Hog Town with the standard AAA beef (No way I'm going to fire up a Kobe burger, that pretty much defeats the entire purpose of having Kobe beef to begin with), cooked to medium. It was a little overcooked, but tasted pretty good.

The poutine? Weak Sauce. The fries were just not good, at all, and the cheese came in one solid lump. Pretty disappointing. The onion rings were pretty good though, deliciously battered with fat onions inside.

Overall, not a bad burger, not a good poutine, the price was pretty steep because everything is a la carte, gave it a shot, but likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service Ive experienced in Toronto, our order took over a hour, and the food wasnt great, burgers were blanned as well, However I can see people in the area enjoying it, maybe because they do not know better, also pricy for a burger! They did comp our food though without question."}
{"text":"They do a burger right here. Quality beef from Canada and from farms that are nice to cows so you can be happy eating it! Salads here are amazing too. Not to mention the great wine selection and a classy but comfortable ambiance. All in all, my favorite restaurant in North Toronto."}
{"text":"Don't go here. 

I ordered the kobe beef burger, expecting something that kicked all sorts of ass. Instead I got a burger that tasted something close to a frozen beef patty served at a workplace barbecue party. 

The apps we're even worse. It's probably my own fault for thinking that a burger place would serve great apps. But I thought, \"hey, this place looks classy, lets give it a shot\". What I got was the most pathetic looking bunch of appetizers I've ever been served. No really. I added pictures. Everything came out limp and poorly presented. 

Just about the only thing they didn't screw up was the wine. Because all they had to do was open it and then pour it in my glass."}
{"text":"Try BCB burger here. And the fries. And a beer. Welcome to heaven. I mean I went there with a Sunday hangover and IT WAS \"LE CURE\". The staff however won't get more than two stars. But what the hell, the food was great. And they have a fireplace so...."}
{"text":"Nice friendly staff and good atmosphere. The burgers are also pretty good. There are some good drinks on offer for a nice refreshment."}
{"text":"A bit expensive, mouth watering menu with a vast selection of burger toppings. You can choose what type of meat you want! Sensational burgers! Helpful staff, cozy yet classy ambiance and great location. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Wow...I was taking a friend from Winnipeg out to lunch on north Yonge Street to the Blackod restaurant, but it appears to have be closed to non rent pay.
So walked a few blocks south and saw the Burger Cellar.
Nice spacious cozy interior and really pleasant servers.
We each ordered a burger with Onion Rings.
The burgers were juicy, with top grade condiments and a fresh bun.
But the Onion Rings were over the moon.  Almost like tempura dipped onions but crispy and tasty.   Best I have ever had anywhere.
So I highly recommend this restaurant and its chef who demonstrates  care for top quality ingredients."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a colleague and we had somewhat high expectations because she really liked it the last time she was here. The decor of the restaurant is dated with burgundy walls and exposed brick, the lighting was dim and the washrooms were not very clean. It wasn't packed for a Saturday night. The burgers were very average tasting. The kids ordered kids meal ($11.95 + taxes) which came with a drink (pop, juice, milk, or add a milkshake for $2.50), the meal options were Grilled Chicken, Mac 'n' Cheese, Cheeseburger, Chicken Strips or Grilled Cheese, the choice of sides were fries, roasted potatoes, veggie sticks (carrots & celery) or Caesar Salad. For dessert, they had a choice of Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry or Mint Chocolate Chip. The kids hamburgers were dry and they were two mini burgers. The fries were ok. I had the duck dynasty burger (with BBQ duck conft, coleslaw, mild cheddar, crispy onions and chipotle mayo) with a side Caesar salad. The burger wasn't really anything special. There wasn't anything different than making it at home on my own BBQ. My hubby had the Burger Cellar burger with bacon, smoked cheddar, onion ring, chipotle BBQ and mushrooms. He upgraded his side to poutine. The service was so-so. There was a time I caught the servers hanging out by the kitchen and they were all on their phones scrolling. This is was one of my least favourite burger joints. It has no ambiance, dated decor, dirty bathrooms and the food was very average.  This will not be a place I want to get my next burger. Burger Priest is just a few doors down and we should've gone there instead.....it was definitely not worth the money I paid."}
{"text":"Pretty uninspiring burger experience, that is if you're into the burger experience.

The pattie reminded me of a PC Prime Rib burger and the bread was a simple sesame seed white bread bun. 

Condements - regular fare - nothing special. 

Beer, burger, side salad $32.00. Once again if you're really into a burger experience try Allen's on the Danforth - still the best value and best experience in this category."}
{"text":"Great burgers.  Best poutine in Toronto (made with duck gravy and real curds). Ambience is really nice and the place has a surprisingly good bar including wine list. The service can be slow and it can be confusing to find your waiter. Go early and you will see lots of upscale families, go later and you find lots of yuppie couples."}
{"text":"The Kobe burger was great.
The prices were pretty good for a good burger
I didn't mind not having a side cause I normally can't finish both anyways. 
Overall great place for a quick classy burger"}
{"text":"Worth the price of Admission! That's about as much as I would do there anyways, go in and admire the setting. Mostly Heels & Suits attended this Burger Cellar from what I noticed. Hey Karl, you know what I did tonight? I brought my Dude Friend for a \"NICE\" dinner and I'm so glad we came here. Don't misunderstand me, read on..... 

While one side of the restaurant was your typical Dining area, we were offered the Highchairs nearby the Bar Arena. Yes, I wrote \"Arena\" because those 3 Guys with their 3 Lady Friends had more GAME than the Toronto Maple Leafs showing on the 2 LCDs. It was as if Mating Season began at the Burger Cellar Bar. What a show indeed! 

One of the Suits chatted the Lady up until he receives that all important call on his Blackberry(Wife of course), so he goes to the lobby while the Lady sits tirelessly and receives the Meal. 15 minutes pass and the Bartender starts to chat her up and then she got a whole bottle of Red Wine realizing she might as well get the most out of this Suit while she can. 

Another 15 minutes pass and the Food arrives and she starts chowing alone and then our Waiter starts chatting her while she drinks and eats alone leaving a bite of the Burger left. When the Suit comes back he begins to schmooze until the Lady goes to the washroom. He realizes the bottle of Red Wine and smirks. He then hones into the Lady's last bite of Burger and smiles to himself as he sneakily grabs it and stuffs it down his throat. 

This FOLKS cannot be seen at your local Craft Burger, Hero Burger, or Whatever Burger. I paid through the nose to see this Mating Show on the Burger Cellar Network as the Burger Cellar Burger(Kobe $16.00) and the Alan's Famous Burger(Natural $10.00) were barely meeting Lick's standards. 

The Red Wine Wall Dispenser Apparatus was pretty interesting as it probably kept them at a recommended Temperature while able to Display & Serve. Onion Rings(6/$5.00) were better than Pickled Fries(3/$3.00) but that's not saying much. 

Definitely a Toronto Institution but not because of the Burgers."}
{"text":"Came around noon on a Sunday a bit dead inside but it's really clean and nice. Lots of space. Free pretzels and they've got a $10 flat lunch bag which includes a pop/fries/burger to go."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8 on a Saturday night.  The food was excellent and the service was great too.  The restaurant was packed, but we were still able to carry on a conversation.  The food came out quickly and was delicious.  I had the Burger Cellar Burger with the Prime Patty, it was one of the best burgers I have had.  

Can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"The ambiance is relaxing and the staff very good. Love the bar setup. Good selection of wine and price range. The service is good and helpful. The food is very good. I would recommend this place to others. I have been here many times and would definitely return."}
{"text":"I came here last week on a whim with some friends b/c the burger's priest was sold out. 

The decor was pretty nice, but we chose to sit at the bar cause they were playing some football game and my friends are really into it.

I found the prices to be a bit steep considering they don't come with a side..but whatev's. I wanted to see what this place was about.

My friends ordered the veggie burger and the burger cellar burger, and I wasn't crazy hungry, so I just got the duck poutine.


OH LORD JESUS IT WAS FANTASTIC. 

Fresh cut fries and chunks of duck, covered in curds and gravy...oh lord. It was good.

The only qualm I had was that it could've used more gravy, and it got mad salty at the end.

My friends loved their food as well, and actually couldn't finish the veggie burger, so there's that.

I'd come here again.


Sidenote: When I got my bill, there were a few items onthere that we didn't order..but she cleared that up right away.


Side side note: If you are there, post a photo of the place on instagram with the hashtag TheBurgerCellar for a free app!"}
{"text":"Duck poutine and calamari at the bar were both great!  Friendly bartenders, and great selection of wines by the glass at affordable prices. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time recently. Food was great. Some add ons for the burgers seemed a little pricey but overall $100 for 2 with wine and appetizers is very fair for the service and quality of food. Nice place for dinner and drinks.

7 days a week, you can go from 11:30-4:30 and get a burger with fries and a drink for $10 including tax. Great value for a great burger"}
{"text":"Came here for a family dinner.  Our server was excellent, the food, however, was not. One of the items we ordered was the coconut shrimp which grandma said looked and tasted exactly like the frozen kind they serve at her seniors home.  Baked onion soup had hardly any cheese on top, so when we commented on this to one of the servers, we were brought over a small plate with some melted cheese on it to add to the onion soup. Food overall was on the bland side. Good choice if you have a large group and are not picky about the food."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! The service was great. We had a really friendly and hilarious waiter named Jeff who made our evening even better. We did have to wait a while to be seated (late sat night) even though we made reservations, but aside from that there is nothing to complain about. The duck poutine was unreal, so delicious. I ordered the posh burger on gluten free bread/natural option for meat. It was so good in between bites I kept complimenting it. Our waiter gave us two recommendations for wine and really? like it couldn't get any better the wine was great. There was a French onion soup special that night and wow.. every single flavour in that soup gave you a mouthgasm. Everything was perfect. Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Where's the beef you ask?

Well, it's here. 

Happened upon this place. 

Not your average burger joint. 


Got the last spot at the bar. :)
Pairing wines with a burger is unique so I gave it a try. 
Ordered the angry burger with a glass of California cab, side Caesar

Just superb! Arrived in short order. 


Packed on a Saturday night. 

Busy bartenders, but attentive. 

Will be back ."}
{"text":"The Angus beef patties were tad bit too dry... But overall service was good, servers were friendly. Milkshake was good but nothing compared to Bareburger."}
{"text":"My husband & I have been to this restaurant twice, both Saturday nights, both were absolutely rammed at The Burger Cellar. Obviously the burgers and atmosphere were good enough that we went back a second time, however  I would be hesitant to go back a third. 
The Food: My husband ordered the natural Burger Cellar Burger with poutine both times. He was happy. I ordered the natural Original burger with caramelized onions on top and onion rings both times. The first time my burger looked like it may have been sitting there a while as the onions had that dull, dry look and were haphazardly hanging off the edge. The second time I was considerably happier as the burger was fresher and juicier than before. I honestly didn't mind the fact that the burgers and sides came separately as my onion rings were excellent both times and customized sides can sometimes make the meal experience much better.
Atmosphere: fine, nice & cozy feeling. Not dressy at all.
Now my issue: The staff at the front are some of the rudest little brats I have ever encountered. Considering how many people are being paid to essentially stand around the front doing nothing but looking frantic & busy you would think they could run things better. Customers getting seated at the wrong tables, being ignored when asking questions . . .??? I saw one lady go up and ask if they knew her entire party was there (I guess she had a reservation and was waiting for others?) she was told rudely \"ya, we know you're here OK?!?!\"  Crazy!! I know it's nice to be busy and it makes them feel pretty important to be in control of a eager crowd but every restaurant has its day and customer service is the first impression your establishment makes on the customer.
I am often astounded to be greeted by rudeness and superiority when I am the one putting my hand in my pocket to support their salary.
I will probably never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really liked this place the first few times I've come, but as I keep coming back I find more disappointment. Here is what I like:
- the lunch menu - $10 for a burger, side and a drink
- the selection of burgers is quite extensive and the number of sides and toppings gives endless options
- the three selections of burgers is cool: for those who like good burger but aren't all into the free range and anti-biotic free, one that is all into the antibiotic free rage, and a higher end prime rib option
- the hostesses, they seem like they move people quite well and do a good job
- the service staff are all wiling to listen when you are in need of something and then pass off message to the appropriate person (i.e. you server)

My complaints are what many on Yelp say, it's quite expensive and all those toppings all come at a cost.
At $4 for fries is not expensive but there isn't much. They weren't that great either.
For the cost of the burger I found it getting very expensive for \"going out for burgers\". The hostesses could provide a bit more communication I think. They are doing a great job seating people but could have a bit more communication in telling people when they will be seated.

One last thing, i caught the service staff in a lie. I asked them a question (not knowing the answer), they answer confidently as if knowing the answer. Then I offer what made me question the answer and ask the question and then they admit they didn't know the answer. They offered to go ask bartender but never came back with the answer. And the continued with the bill despite the answer would have changed the cost.

I might come back for lunch as I still think it's a great deal. But if I want a burger for dinner, I might go try something else next time. I think this place is popular because it offers the people who are in this neighbouhood more upscale option for a good ol' burger and does offer extra stuff for the cost, it's just a lot of extras. But for me, I think it's a bit much."}
{"text":"If I was basing this review solely on food, I'd give it a two. 

In my opinion, the burgers were below average (and I'm obsessed with burgers). We shared the Burger Cellar Burger and the Angry Burger. Of the two, the Angry was better (if you like spice) but neither gave me a foodgasm. Plus the fries and poutine were both barely lukewarm. 

When we mentioned the cold fries to the waiter he was extremely apologetic and brought out hot ones immediately. He also comped them. For that reason I'm bumping up my score to a 3. The service was very good and that counts for something in my book.

Still, there's something about the burgers that just didn't thrill me. Sorry y'all."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place so far! Love the wine pairing!! The bison option is great and the duck poutine is awesome. This is the place to go on friday to start the week end on the right way!"}
{"text":"Came here for an unofficial work, Christmas lunch.

High end, sit-down burger joint where menu items have wine pairings.

Place was pretty full for a midweek, midday meal. 

I ordered their grilled cheese accompanied by poutine (healthy food was not on the agenda that day). The portion was HUGE! The grilled cheese was cut into 8 quarters and it was grilled to perfection. It was made from a combination of two types of mild cheese. The poutine was very filling and authentic; however, the gravy had a hint of a strong flavour, like a hard liquor-type flavour, not my favourite.

The servers were nice, knowledgeable and friendly but seemed overwhelmed when our group asked for separate bills. The orders were mixed up or duplicate bills were handed out.

This place was accommodating, the people were nice, the food was ok and if a group wanted to go there, I'd join them."}
{"text":"Had a prime angry burger ($16) and a poutine as a side, great burger just a good amount of meat flavor and topping flavor I recommend adding cheese if the burger doesn't come with it standard but that's up to your taste buds 

My issues with the restaurant was the poutine the cheese curds were tastleless the gravy was ok at best for a $7 poutine it was underwhelming 

The service and decoration of the restaurant were great would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Way back when I played dodgeball, we wanted to celebrate our dodgeball championship for the season, so we went out for some burgers and brews. I heard about the hype from some friends so I decided this would be a great place to check out near Yonge and Lawrence. The place was large and comfortable for seating. So we were greeted and seated by our friendly hostess. Then came by Jeff, who was our server and was quite witty. I was also impressed about his knowledge of the menu. He was really elaborate and descriptive on our options. I ended up getting a pint of Shock Top Belgian White beer for $5 beer special. As for dinner, I decided to order THE BURGER CELLAR BURGER (THE BCB) - Ontario smoked cheddar, apple wood bacon, saut√©ed mushrooms, chipotle BBQ sauce and a beer-battered onion ring. It was pretty good, but a little small. I was still hungry after. You would think that a burger would come with sides and that you didn't have to order them separately. This is the reason why I am not giving this place a 5 star. I am still in search of the best burger in the world..Im getting close, I can feel it! Until next time, JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"i call this one the macdonalds for rich people. the food was pretty good, i had the turkey burger and my bo had the alan burger. but it was the service that was mediocre to say the least - not sure why but our waiter did not seem very enthused to be serving us. i expected it to be more of an 'adult' experience on a saturday night but it was crowded with kids and some seriously botox-injected moms - i guess they were slumming it on a saturday night? not sure if i will go again, i would probably just go to Burger Priest 2 doors down."}
{"text":"We still like going here but it can get busy. Burgers are great. Service is usually good but can be hit and miss depending on server. Great kids meals. Love the natural beef burger. Great ambience."}
{"text":"The burgers are great and the service is second to none.  They had a bit of mishap with our order and we had multiple people come to our table to apologize and they ended up giving us a huge break on the final bill.  It was really nice of them to take these measures without us even saying anything.  Will definitely go back..."}
{"text":"We allllmost ended up going to The Burger's Priest instead of here due to the mixed reviews - so glad that we took a shot on The Burger Cellar because it was awesome!

Many people had commented on the poor service, but we didn't experience that at all. We were seated very promptly, our server was very attentive the entire time, and all the staff were super friendly! 

We started off with the Pickle Fries. OH. MY. GOD. SO good!!! Panko-herb breaded pickles fried. I have had many disappointing fried pickles but these show just how delicious they can be when done right! Nice & crispy, and the dill and garlic sauce that came with it was delicious (the flavour & texture is very tzatziki like;) I wish I could have taken a big tub home of that stuff!

I opted for the Black Angus BCB Burger. Smoked cheddar, apple cider bacon, chipotle bbq sauce, sauteed mushrooms, and a beer battered onion ring (onion ring, like the pickles, was nice & crispy! yum! no soggy fried foods here!). This was actually one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. Perfectly cooked & juicy, nice crisp from the onion ring, the cheese was gooey and delicious, and the chipotle bbq sauce & mushrooms just worked so well with everything. Highly, highly reccomended.

My only issue with this place is the pricing: you're paying about 10-17 dollars for a burger - now I'd be totally okay with paying that if it came with a side, but this is 10-17 a la carte. Most of the sides are actually pretty pricy and tack on an additional ~4-7 dollars to your meal. I just feel this is a smidge pricier than I feel I should be paying.

Regardless, pricy or not they make one tasty burger! I will most certainly be back and am looking forward to devouring some more of those amazing pickle fries! Om nom nom!"}
{"text":"Had the fancy bison burger with goat cheese was delicious service was great the place was nothing fancy but clean. 
Definitely a must check out...not sure if it would be a regular spot for me though."}
{"text":"Have always had a good meal. There are a lot of choices (even vegetarian!) and something for most palates. Service can be a bit hit or miss and tends to be noisy during dinner rush."}
{"text":"I visited on a Friday around 8pm and when we arrived, the place was packed. As a recommendation, consider making a reservation on Opentable beforehand. The service was good and I especially enjoyed the duck poutine. There was a generous amount of shredded duck pieces and flavourful gravy coupled with cheese curds. 

On the other hand, I felt that the burgers were a bit overpriced and did not like how it didn't come with a side. However, the concept of pairings of wine with burger is innovative and I liked that the prime burger came with a brioche bun and meat was cooked just right ( a little red). Overall, experience was good but not sure if I would come here again given it was not spectacular in terms of the burger and price doesn't seem justified."}
{"text":"The Burger Cellar is an upscale sit down burger place. It's a good place for a family dinner, or a birthday party. Some of the food is pretty good, and some of it misses the mark. It might be more of a 3.5...

First off, the tilapia po boy sandwich was great. It was huge, and had a great coleslaw on top. My only complaint was that it was a little soft and soggy, and lacked contrast in texture. I wish the outside of the fish had been crispier, but I suspect it lost some crispiness from the slaw and creama on top. But overall it was satisfying.

The deep fried pickles are really good. The outside is very crispy, as they are covered in panko bread crumbs. Honestly, they should bread the tilapia for the po boy in panko as well, and capture the same crispiness they have in these pickles. The tzatziki sauce on the side was a nice touch, and tasted very fresh as it was loaded with dill.

The negatives of the burger cellar is they run out of things a lot it seems. On a previous visit my girlfriend tried to order a turkey burger, but they had run out of turkey. This time I tried to order Creemore, and they had run out of that. When only having four beers on tap, it is a little sad to run out of one of them. The worst part though is that their fries are terrible, and really below average. They are not crispy at all, and are completely void of flavour. I don't think they are fresh cut, but cooked from frozen, and they should really re-think the oil they are frying them in."}
{"text":"Friday lunch was busy! We were seated, but never given menus so we had to self-serve. Burgers are great, the black angus patties that we ordered were a good size and were juicy. Prices are high though, a special burger will run you about $12-$13 without sides and a side of fries is another $4.95.

I had the ultimate burger. Goat cheese is one of my favourite toppings to go on a burger and overall this burger tasted great. The mac and cheese is another story. The noodles were firm as I prefer, but the sauce had little presence - there wasn't much and it didn't taste very cheesy. Unfortunate way to spend $5.95, it wasn't filling either.

Service was slow in general, missing menus and they took our burger to a wrong table (rather strange since the waitress had brought it to our table but another waiter took it out of her hands). Mayo squeeze bottles are frustrating to use - they don't work unless they're absolutely full. Unlike ketchu, mayo doesn't really flow so no amount of squeezing will get the mayo out. 

Free wifi. Wifi password is bcburgers.

They have a bagged lunch special: $10 for burger, fries and drink. I wish I went for that."}
{"text":"Interesting place.

The lineup at the new Priest location was too long, so i ended up here. It felt almost like the Keg of burger's. Fancy decor for a burger joint, and options to choose from in terms of your meat.

I think i found the service good, the decor nice, the food  tasting good and the prices reasonable. However, spending $30 on a burger, a side and a cook is becoming the new norm i guess? 

I still prefer Bamburger of the Priest for the area. Something about the decor and service was a little too much for me for a burger joint. 

When i want a burger, i don't expect to eat it fancy."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch very nice sophisticated ambiance. Had interesting items in the menu like Organic Bison burgers and Vegan Lima bean and Chickpeas Crusted burger. I ended up ordering the Vegan burger and side of sweet potato fries, my husband ordered the grilled chicken with rosemary potatoes and veggies. ($17.00)

The Vegan burger was Panko crusted, fresh and to die for! Price for my burger was $13 but it did not include the sweet potato fries they were extra $5.00. Actually none of their burgers come with sides, you have to order them separately and they range from $5-$13 dollars.
It's great addition to Yonge and Lawrence restaurants."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a meetup group last night. I love burgers and especially with bacon. The place was packed for at Tue night which is a good sign. 

They have a good selection of burgers. The burgers do not come with sides and you have to order the sides separately. Now I am usually happy with just the burger but if you do want a side or two it will add up. Also they have 3 options for the burger patty - Angus beef, Prime beef and Bison. The Prime and Bison cost extra. 

I got the Angry Burger with Prime beef and it was $15.95. It came with jalepeno Havarti, sherry peppercorn bacon, crispy jalepenos and spicy Buffalo mayo. The burger was very juicy and good. They also have different bun options including lettuce wrapped. I will definitely get that next time. I opted for their brioche bun and  it came at no extra cost. The menu comes with wine pairing suggestions and I got a 9oz glass of the red that was suggested with my burger. It paired beautifully.

I was stuffed and ended up ordering coffee for dessert while the rest of the group ordered chocolate cake and they all loved it. 

I will definitely be back even though it is a bit pricey. I don't mind splurging for a good burger every once in a while."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised by all the bad reviews of this place! Personally I had a great experience here.

This restaurant has more of a family feel, but that might have something to do with the time we went - around 7pm. The restaurant is full of tables and benches, which was comfortable and suited the cuisine (one should always be comfortable while eating a burger). The service was attentive but not overbearing, and the food was pretty decent!

Not wanting to jack up the price of my dinner, I decided to go with one of the suggested ones on the menu. Even though I'm usually a meat lover, I tried the vegetarian, and really enjoyed it! The patty was a breaded one made from peppers, pumpkin, chickpeas, cream cheese, and a few other items. Served with avocado ketchup and goat cheese, it was basically perfect! Everyone else enjoyed their beef burgers, and we shared some crispy sweet potato fries. 

While I wouldn't say this is the best burger joint in the city, it definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, amazing Mac and cheese, ok service. Definitely a good spot if you want to have a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Well I'm not sure why this place is rated so low. But hubby & I just had lunch here & thought it was rather nice. We both had the BCB burger but different toppings & sides. Burgers were delicious & the fries were nice. Not soggy like one reviewer said. We also had the brownie for dessert. The brownie was okay but not amazing. Service from the waiter was prompt & polite. 

I even like the decor here. It kinda reminds me of the Keg vibe. Leather covered chairs, wooden tables, brown tones in the decor, fireplace too. I would come here again. Definitely looks like a nicer dining experience than the burger priest which was cramped & tiny."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday celebration & loved everything about this place. The servers were very attentive, explained the different types of bread/bun & our water glasses never empty. Delicious burger & nice presentation - I would 100% visit again!!"}
{"text":"Okay.  If you like red meat, great wine and football/hockey I think I may have a place for you.  The Burger Cellar serves up some of the best grilled beef in Toronto.  The bar is complete and the service is stellar.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"An upscale burger place. Nice decor with dimmed lights.
 
Duck Poutine was unbelievably amazing! It's a unique menu, and I would come back just for this. 

The burgers were okay. Nothing special about them, and find them a bit over-priced. 

Our waiter was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I was indeed sceptical of the concept of burger and wine.  But I ended up liking this place.  The \"Hoisin Chicken Lollipop\" was very tasty (as are many things covered in Hoisin), the \"Duck Poutine\" as outstanding and the \"Angry Burger\" was very good.  The wine selection was not bad and very reasonably priced.  The server was very knowledgeable.  We were in a group with lots of toddlers and the server was very patient and attentive."}
{"text":"Love the Allen burger. Awesome rings. Wish i could purchase the Chipotle mayo by the bucket!"}
{"text":"I came here on Valentine's day with my boyfriend and our experience was good. We felt welcomed and taken care of, even though the restaurant was full around 7 pm and we had to sit at the high tables close to the bar. 
Our waiter was quite attentive and professional.

The 4 course meal (appetizer, soup, main course and dessert + a bottle of red wine) was a great deal.
The burger was tasty and the peri peri chicken was even better. The cheesecake could be improved though.
I will definitely come back for burgers and have already recommended it to all of my friends and colleagues at work."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area today and decided to stop here for lunch because he wanted a burger. I liked my first impression of it. All wooden decor with a fireplace and cozy booths made for a really nice atmosphere.

I had the arugula salad with goat cheese and roasted peppers topped with a salmon fillet. The salad alone was $12, which seemed pricey for what it was. But the salmon was pretty cheap ($6) considering the portion size (7 oz). And it was was actually cooked quite well. Overall I enjoyed my meal, although the dressing tasted like it was from a bottle. My boyfriend was impressed with his burger too - he said it was really juicy and flavourful, although overpriced."}
{"text":"To me it is a burger \"meat\" market, but to one of my dinner mate (no name here) it is for sure a \"meat\" market!

Even before I settled myself and think of what good to eat... selecting my meat (kobe?or AAA? or Natural or whatever) my friend already ask me to check out another table? Me? I am here for the burger... burger.... you know food!!!

Leave me alone, I am trying to keep my choice simple and cost down as adding gourmet toppings at $1.25 each will easily made this burger an extremely overpriced burger! 

The Posh Burger with AAA Black Angus ($12) cooked medium with a hint of pink is in fact quite good. The mushroom, white truffle oil and mozzarella really give the patty a good flavour. 

My other dinner mate all enjoyed their burgers and we all have a draft beer as a side.

I might skip dinner and come to The Burger Cellar for lunch instead as they are offering lunch specials for $10 that includes a classic burger, fries and a non alcoholic beverage."}
{"text":"Live close by and decided to give this place a try and I was not dissapointed. Amazing burgers, very large and juicy. Sides are a not included which is a bit of a bummer but the burger was too good to not give 5 stars. You can't go wrong with the BCB. Service was fast too, and they were busy."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Great atmosphere. Delicious burgers. I usually get the BCB with natural beef. Bacon, smoked cheddar, a big crunchy onion ring. Mmmmmm. Tried the blue cheese burger. Not bad, but I'm sticking with the BCB. Duck poutine is tasty and filling. 
Can't compare this with Burger's Priest a few doors down. Completely different burger experience. But, I will say that the priest's burgers have lost their hold on me. Now I feel a little nauseous after eating. Just sayin'..."}
{"text":"Heard of The Burger Cellar from friends who live around the area so I came here on a Friday night for dinner. Ordered a wine and then realized after ordering it that they actually paired burgers with wines. But I had my heart set on the Burger Cellar Burger and both wine and burger were delicious, nonetheless. The sides were just okay. The mac & cheese was a little dry and the poutine was not bad but not great. Given that these sides were $6.95, I would've expected better. Atmosphere was great and no complaints about the server - he had good timing and was pleasant! Overall, a good dining experience and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian burger I've ever had! The staff always makes feel like family!! And Scott is the best bartender!"}
{"text":"The Burger Cellar is a restaurant that tries to present itself as an upscale burger joint in the midtown area. This is made apparent by the wine pairing options that they have for their burgers (I can't think of another place that pairs wine with burgers quite frankly).

I opted to try just the food here on its own, however. I ordered the Angry Burger that was recommended by my server, along with a Caesar salad on the side. The burger was pretty good and I was a fan of the pepper encrusted bacon that it came with. The Caesar salad was very mediocre though, and was definitely overpriced for what it was.

Overall, the food was okay but it's tough to recommend this place given the availability of better burger joints in the immediate vicinity. The menu is overpriced for the quality of food that you get here as well. It definitely caters to people who want to eat burgers in a more classy environment more than anything, Imo."}
