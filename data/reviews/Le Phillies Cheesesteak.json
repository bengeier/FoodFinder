{"text":"WOW!  this is the real deal. i have to agree that this place did start off a little bit rocky but let me tell you they have found themselves and it is worth having a revisit.  fresh bread baked daily and prime rib eye meat leaves every bite just as juicy as the last!...and that's just the cheesesteak! they also serve a pork sandwich with spinach that is extremely flavourful as the meat is allowed to soak up its juices. the chicken sandwich has just the right amount of spice to keep you going back for more, however i think they should develop a sauce to pair with it as the bread is a little bit overpowering.  i absolutely love the mozzarella cheesesticks and would go back every day for these alone!! the pretzel, when warmed up, allows your imagination to drift off and really make you believe you are in Philly, even if its just for a moment! go see for yourself, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"YUM!! If there's one new(ish) place in Mile End to try, go for Le Phillies. I thought they made a fantastic cheesesteak that was true to the ones I tried while in Philly, but the guys/atmosphere were definitely Montreal.   I haven't met a ton of people in the neighbourhood who've been yet, so I'd say to just go already if you haven't."}
{"text":"Tried this place for a second time just to give it a chance cause I had high hopes for a cheesesteak place around here. Not the best place , I've gone to many places in New Jersey and Philadelphia such as Jims steaks and Gino's and this wasn't so great. The meat is ok but the buns lack quality . In my opinion it's a knock off of the real thing in a weird cheese sauce kind of way. Fried pickles I had the first time I went were ok . But the cheese steak which is supposed to be the star didn't get finished. And I love me some cheesesteak"}
{"text":"One word: AWESOME ! STEAK: juicy and flavorful. CHEESE: Whiz  ONIONS: just enough for that sweet taste BREAD: soft, buttery and held all the goodness in. FRIES: get the spicy fries, the seasoning was just right. It was a perfect sandwhich.  Different, tasty, well done, full of flavor.  I'm definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. The bread could have been a little more fluffy I guess but everything else was very tasty. Had the spicy fries but I preferred my friends cheeesey fries"}
{"text":"i wanted this place to be better.  if you are looking for authentic philly cheesteaks like pat's or jim's, you'll want more.  the bread wasn't right for me.  that being said it's an okay approximation of what it should be.  i will probably go back in a bit to see if they figured it out."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and a great price!  Over the top welcoming staff and a very inviting place to have a taste of Philadelphia without going to philly. The chicken and waffles is easily the best I have had in Montreal and probably the best I have had in all of North America.   Everything is fresh and is made with love and care and it clearly translates into great tasting food without having too much or too little of anything.   The owners have clearly travelled extensively and have gone to trouble of eating 100 cheesesteaks from different place and have assembled the best from their foodie destinations for your enjoyment.  I can't say enough good things about this place, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place makes a very good cheese steak the meat is top quality and the bread was fluffy and buttery a unique experience.  I have tried all the cheese steak places available in Philadelphia and with my job pretty much every state in the contiguous united states as well as Hawaii.  There are many twists on a steak including the versions made by sub way and yes even diners where you can get a cheese steak, 2 eggs and bacon, a bagel and possibly for the hardcore a gyro..  Many strokes for different folks I guess..    The most important things I look for are top quality meat and a solid fresh roll.  This place does it right."}
{"text":"I would give this place only 1 star but being that I went on the 3rd day after they opened,  I'm hoping they will do better with time. But who am I kidding?  Most places are best at first then get worse with time.  I could go on and on about how I fell in love with cheesesteak sandwiches on the New Jersey coastline in so many diners. That I haven't eaten one in Philadelphia...but just by comparing pictures of cheesesteaks from the ones these guys have supposedly based theirs on, their cheesesteaks look so sad. Their buns are crying to be filled up. The amount of meat in the sandwich is so ridicule, I don't understand how, after over a week since their \"Grand Opening\", no one else has written anything on here.  I love cheesesteak sandwiches,  but I guess I'll need to continu making my own,  until I go back to diners in the U.S.A. where they definitely don't skimp on quantity or quality.   Very sorry not to have a new place to indulge."}
{"text":"I liked the cheesesteak- wiz with onions, but I didn't love it. I wanted to loooove it especially for the price. I needed a fix of philly but this wasn't Philly. The bread is what is too different. It was just the wrong bread. Sad. But the guys who own the place are real nice. And they know how to make good fries! The place was clean (besides the cigarette smell in the tiny bathroom), the extra condiments were on point, tv playing football. It was the right experience but the wrong taste."}
{"text":"I was hopeful but apprehensive when I learned that there was a cheesesteak place opening up across from Olimpico where the bookstore used to be. Cheesesteaks can be difficult; even the places on Philly's South Street can lead you astray. Unfortunately, my doubts were warranted. The meat was chewy, and there was no grease drip. The sandwich left me with a parched mouth, not dabbing grease off my chin with a napkin as is typical. Hoang-Khai's comment below about the cheese being already melted is correct. While Cheez Whiz obviously comes in liquid form, other options like American cheese also came ladled out of a white plastic bucket. As the cheese was not in slice form, it could not be cut into the meat while it sizzled on the flat top. I won't echo Rudy's comment on the cheese tasting chemical, but I will say that seeing it come out of a bucket made me wonder how close a recreation of a Philly cheesesteak I would be getting. Unfortunately, the answer was \"not very\". This is a disappointing bang for your lunch buck on one of the best lunch streets in the city."}
{"text":"Not worth it for the price... Service is nice .. But bread is not very good and meat is disgusting ... Sorry really tried to like it... Super pricy also like $12 or something like that for sandwich and a drink"}
{"text":"Chef told me his brother was from Philly so his cheesesteak is legit.  From what I know about philly cheesesteaks, you're supposed to grill the meat and onion,  add cheese and onion on top of the steak, then slice open the bread and place it on top of the meat/onion/cheese. Then, you flip everything over, hence assembling the sandwich.  But that's not what I saw. The chef only grilled slices of ribeye steak. He then puts the meat on a bun and hands it over to the man at the cheese station who simply drizzles scoops of pre-melted cheese on top of the meat.  In terms of food:  As appetizer, I took 4 mozarella sticks for about 5$. They were absolutely bland. The only flavor I tasted was oil (from the deep fryer). And you might think, well that's why there's a marinara sauce accompanying it. To be honest, the marinara tasted as if it had been diluted with water.   I took the american cheesesteak with onions for 9.75$.  The steak was no doubt high quality product, but it's execution was a shame. The meat wasn't grilled (browned), it looked steamed (overcooked at low temperature).   The onion may have been grilled, but it lacked flavor (no salt, no pepper, no steak juice)  And finally there's the cheese. The pre-melted american cheese looked like a scifi-sperm sauce and dripped all over the table (low viscosity).  The place looked nice and clean, but the food was wayyy too expensive. I felt like even subway has a better cheesesteak.   To the so called chef (don't take it too personally): I don't know if you have a degree in culinary arts, but when you can't grill your slices of steak properly, you will have a problem selling the 'original' cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"A disgrace of a steak sandwich.  The bread: tasteless, industrially manufactured. Or at least, tastes like it. The cheese: tastes like a gooey paste of chemicals The meat: nothing worth calling steak. Thin slices of frozen Chinese fondue beef, overcooked (steamed instead of browned) in their juice, and the result is chewy, hard and tasteless meat. I had to spit it out.  The sandwich itself was crying of hunger as there was barely any meat inside it. It is by far the worst 10 dollars I have ever spent! Thankfully, the bagel shop was not far."}
