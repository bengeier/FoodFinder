{"text":"I just ordered lunch at Tower Deli. The first gentleman who helped me was great. The cashier was polite as well. The woman who made my salad, Christina, was very rude. She spoke in a harsh tone to me and her coworkers. She slammed her utensils down and stomped away while making my salad at one point. No one said or did anything negative to her to elicit such poor customer service and team work. Christina's attitude is bad. She could use some additional customer service training."}
{"text":"Ordered the Caesar salad. Lettuce was deep green,  cheese was nice and firm, and the dressing was thick and tasty. Lastly the chicken was moist."}
{"text":"fantastic Rueben, great value.  They close at 2 because this downtown Mall is quiet late afternoon,  but they served me at 2:05 and even allowed me to relax and eat inside.  nice folks."}
{"text":"Tower Deli was always a part of my daily RTA venture from rapid to bus about half a decade ago and it is still awesome to this day. The food is really good, especially considering it's a quick-serve place downtown. The coffee is local and also really good, and the staff is funny and friendly. I highly recommend their soups and sandwiches. It is by far one of the best quick places you can eat in the downtown / bus line area."}
{"text":"I am going to miss the hell out of Tower Deli. Best breakfast and it's not even a question. Their wraps? To die for. Cleveland just lost a hidden gem. All good things must come to an end sadly."}
{"text":"Just updating to say TD is becoming a regular morning visit for me, so that must say something. I love that even on days I don't stop in, I get a wave and a smile as I'm wheeling my bike past the front doors :)"}
