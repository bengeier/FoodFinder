{"text":"enjoy the 10% discount when paying with cash. Food is good, my fav is spicy chili chicken, vegetable fried rice and beef with black been sauce
Try it out!"}
{"text":"Will never go to this restaurant again. Lacking customer service.  We were 5 of us and she was giving a table meant for 4 people, not accommodating at all. Such a small table, we would have to hold our plates in our hands to keep the rest of the food on the table. So we left, found a better restaurant Kim Kim, good food, good quantity, and good customer service."}
{"text":"Don't expect a warm welcome, a few of the staff seem a little upset that they have to work there, but the food is so amazingly delicious and affordable that we make the hike from Whitby every 2 or 3 weeks to have their Spicy Dragon Shrimp...it is simply the best meal on our planet. I recommend the Manchurian beef, but you have to specify you want it spicy!
Go there!"}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from here many times. One of the best Hakka Chinese food that I've tried so far. My fave dish is the garlic shrimp! Almost all dishes are spicy so if you can't eat that spicy ask them for mild."}
{"text":"This has been a go to spot for Hakka food for my since my high school days, but quality control has been EXTREMELY poor as of late. 

I have now found A FOREIGN METAL WIRE in my takeout order of Spicy Dragon Chicken TWICE within a few months. 

Since it has been a go-to of mine since 2007, I gave them another chance when it first happened (even though I received no compassion when I called in to aware them of the issue and was only offered to bring the chicken back in for a new order).

Today while eating another takeout order of Spicy Dragon Chicken, I found ANOTHER metal wire. As pictured, the wire is dirty and quite large. It definitely could have done some damage if I had not chewed thoroughly and identified the foreign object before swallowing. 

I felt like I had to do my due diligence and let the public know of the potential hazard that comes with deciding to eat here. The food is good if you're willing to take your chances, but I won't be taking mine anymore. If this has happened to me twice, it has to have also happened to others. 

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING. Just make sure you get it to-go because the service is absolutely horrible. I needed a drink and I made eye contact with my server for an awkward minute or two before he called another girl over to ask her why this customer was looking at him. She looked at him and shrugged. I never got my drink."}
{"text":"Very bad. Food is all bland. The chicken was pink inside and made me and my boyfriend both sick. I think this place has single handedly turned me off of Chinese takeout for life."}
{"text":"If u want quality food at a cheap price this is the place to go. Always buy the chilli chicken and chicken fried rice. Always a lot of food enough for 3 or 4 people and a really good price. Quality is not excellent but still good for what u get."}
{"text":"Don't go here looking for ambiance. This is a classic hole in the wall.

Rather my suggestion would be to go with your best friends to catch up over some good comfort food. The spicy dragon chicken is worth a try - its basically dry chicken with red chilli powder or something like that tossed freely with sauteed white onions.

We paid about 50$ for a meal for 4 with leftovers to bring home."}
{"text":"My favourite Hakka joint. Food is consistently great. Spicy, fresh and reasonably priced. Highly recommend the chilli chicken (dry), shrimp pakora, and spicy green beans."}
{"text":"Great food - had crispy chicken and chili beef. Most people seem to be getting take out (10% off?) but it was pleasant to sit in and eat."}
{"text":"This little hakka chinese restaurant is a gem. The food here is always great! I really mean it. The chicken pekora is the best in the city. Not too spicy. Not too salty.  Just right. The actual place is tiny and dingy looking. Don't let that fool you. I always do takeout. Food is plentiful and you really do get the best bang for you buck. I suggest you call first to place your order. The place is always busy."}
{"text":"It's okay. I prefer China cottage. It's not at that level... But it'll do. 

Food was decent but the service is a bit slow. I don't mind waiting but only if the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Their special spicy dragon seasoning was something that tasted unique to me. Recommend the shrimp or the chicken. Other than that, their other popular dishes such as the chili chicken and Manchurian beef fried rice were average at best."}
{"text":"We've been here numerous times, mostly when it was fairly new. We find the food tasty and the servings generous.  Definitely great value for your money.  When we dined here recently, we were thinking that the food/servings may have changed already.  However, we were pleased that it hasn't.  Food still great. We ordered Chicken Pakora, Chili Chicken with gravy, Cantonese Chow Mein and Manchurian chicken n shrimp fried rice.  There were 3 of us, all big eaters, but we have enough leftovers to last us another meal. However, service kinda slowed down. Also, when it was time to pay, we were told that their machine was not working and they can only take cash.  They should at least let us know beforehand. No sign on the door or anywhere. That' s just not cool.  But we would still come back, for sure."}
{"text":"Spicy Dragon is of impeccable value! One time I had some lunch there with my father and it was delicious! I reccomend it to anyone living nearby to eat out there or buy for dinner. Trust me on this one you won't be let down! ;-)"}
{"text":"Hakka chilli chicken is fantastic. I like the Hakka without gravy in this place... it just is good."}
{"text":"a hot and spicy greasy spoon 

highlight is the vegetable manchurian fried rice, it's the size of Mt. Everest!  look at the pic

and the fresh chopped chilli peppers on the tables. 

ordering 2 dishes can feed 4 people, easy. 

taste hmm bit saltly, blast of chilli/chilli sauces, soy, take out quality
good value if you're feeling like hakka/chinese/indian"}
{"text":"The food is good :) I'm super happy it is halal and am always satisfied. We always get takeout and are never disappointed. Definitely my go to place for Chinese food. The only reason I'm giving it a four is because I've never actually sat in so I can't say it's perfect when I haven't experienced it all."}
{"text":"Great Hakka Food! We got the Spicy Dragon Fish (must have) & Chilli Chicken which was okay. It's comparable to Tangerine. Prices are descent. Staff is very nice. Place is extremely small."}
{"text":"Ordered chilli chicken, manchurian beef and fried rice. Portion was good, chilli chicken was awesome and spicy. Service wasn't really great. It's a perfect place If you want cheap hakka Chinese.

Seating space is very limited.  Not a place for large group."}
{"text":"The place is small and cramped,  and the orders take sometime, but even with that,  I'm still giving this place a 5 out of 5.  The food is that good. If you need a recommendation,  I suggest the Shrimp Pakora (A9)."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're want some quick and incredibly cheap Asian take out. I wouldn't recommend eating in, as the place doesn't have a very nice atmosphere, but if you need a quick fix for dinner because you don't want to cook, it's perfect.

The menu is incredibly cheap for the quantity you get, especially when you get take out. They give 10% off if you pay with cash when getting take out.

Their noodles aren't the greatest, and in my opinion, neither are many of their meat selections (although I haven't tried all of them), but their rice is amazing; even if you're not particularly a rice fan. The Manchurian Beef Fried Rice is incredible and the Szechuan Beef Fried Rice is also pretty good. They give generous portions, so the rice can easily feed three people, and it's only $5.50-6.75. Their best meat dish from what I've tried is their General Tao."}
{"text":"Bland food, needs more flavour -too much spice! Pickering location better. Great price but that's it"}
{"text":"What a sham!! I made an order and went to pick it up. I got home and found out it was the wrong order!! I asked them to correct it and they said they would. When I asked for a discount,  because of their mistake. They accused me of taking advantage of them and said they would give me a smile instead. I'm furious!!  I've ordered from them many times. Just horrible customer service!!  They will get no more business from me!!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge Chinese food fan. I have gotten take out here once with my boyfriend and it was not bad at all. The spicy dragon chicken & chilli chicken are both good choices!"}
{"text":"Food is great, but the customer service is unreal. Not friendly at all. When you ask the servers a question its like they're doing you a favour by answering your question. I just order the same thing every time because I'm scared to ask for suggestions lol. I always tip above 15% when I go out, but here I tip almost nothing. I feel bad but the service is really horrible."}
{"text":"The menu has a ton of variety, and service is never a problem.

The food is terribly delicious, prices are reasonable and portions are plenty.

The only criticism I have is almost 3/4 of the menu is too spicy for me.

Bring a jar of yogurt just in case....."}
{"text":"I used to order frequently from the location at Kennedy and Lawrence for years. It was always delicious. I tried the Pickering location (after being recently disappointed by the Kennedy & Lawrence location) and I was yet again very disappointed. Not sure if they changed their chef but the quality and flavour were just not there anymore. I ordered the chilli shrimp, chilli chicken and sweet and sour chicken. After eating we ended up tossing the left overs. It wasn't worth reheating. I'm sad that this restaurant is not the great Hakka food it used to be."}
{"text":"Nothing exciting but a decent Hakka Chinese place.  If you like spicy food in large portions, this is the place for you.  I haven't ever eaten in, only done take out, so I can't say anything about the service, but the take out is fast.  You get a ton of food and a huge container of white rice to go with it.  We haven't tried too many options, but my husband loves the chili chicken (he likes things that can burn the skin off your tongue).  I like their crispy beef, which is nicely coated and crunchy outside but tender inside.  We will have to eat in sometime, but if you need lots of quick, inexpensive take out, this is a good place to try."}
{"text":"Worst customer service on the phone! We had about 8 items from the menu we wanted to order and we had a few kids that don't eat Hakka food so we just asked if they could take the chow mien noodles and do it with beef and broccoli and that's it. The lady kept going on about not wanting to make it special and she kept saying other dishes and we just asked for one of the beef chow mien and add broccoli instead so we don't have to go order from another Canadian style Chinese place. We had to cancel the entire order and the lady was really rude about it. Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. The food was horrible and the service was even worse. The food was extremely bland and tastes like nothing. I ordered shanghai noodles with shrimp and there were literally 2 shrimps in the entire plate. The beef with broccoli I ordered had absolutely no taste and probably 5 pieces of beef. I should have ordered a plate of beans broccoli to be honest. 
Our waitress was extremely rude and did not give any eye contact at all. She made me and my mom feel very unwelcome. I would highly recommend to not come here. Tangerine has wayyyyy better food and service, it's worth the extra 15 min drive to whitby."}
{"text":"If you're a Student living in Toronto, on a very tight budget and in need for good food? Well look no further! This is the place for you! It's cheap, fresh tasting, good on flavors and as well good service! I always have my food on takeout due to the ugly Decor, but not let that fool you! The Food makes up for it! The food that are ordered are: Chili Chicken with gravy, Manchurian Chicken,  Chicken Fried Rice and Chili Paneer and all that for a decent price! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"For the price at lunch you cannot go wrong and they give you a huge take out container too. Recommend calling in your order because the lineup is ridiculous."}
{"text":"A nice little restraint that served Indo-chinese fusion food. We got large portions of the dishes, a welcome surprize for students on budget. The staff was well behaved and courteous as well.
All in all, its a decent place to chill with friends and family"}
{"text":"Hands down worst Chinese/Hakka food I have every put into my body. Do not go here please...absolute garbage"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place since it first opened in Scarborough. The food is consistently good. For first timers definitely try the Chili chicken either dry or with gravy, garlic shrimp, spicy dragon fish, and any of the fried rice dishes. The dishes range from $5.5 - $8, and the portion sizes are huge.  It's my fav Hakka restaurant, and since I've moved downtown I really miss it. Unless you have a small group I recommend doing takeout as the seating area is small."}
{"text":"Great value here. 5.95 lunch special has a decent menu selection and includes green tea or soft drink. Chilli chicken, Hakka noodles and vegetable chicken with steamed rice are all good bets!"}
{"text":"My brother used to always bring home an order of their chilli chicken. It's the only thing I get here, haven't really tried anything else out. The scent makes your mouth water and the chicken is tender. The sauce is extremely spicy, you can ask for mild but it tastes bette when it's spicy. Comes with a free bowl of rice."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here many times and never once disappointed.

Try these dishes. You won't be disappointed either!

Crab and corn soup
Hot and spicy soup 

Dry chilli chicken
Seafood fried rice

Beef and chicken hot plate.
Chicken pakora"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem!!!!!  I used to go to their first location in Scarborough, but found out that their Pickering location is closer to me.  It's also bigger and cleaner than the Scarb location.  Best tasting Hakka food, reasonable price and good portions!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Hakka food in Scarborough! I eat here all the time! The take out service is efficient."}
{"text":"4 stars for their Chicken Pakora Appetizer.

Everything else was a bit too salty and greasy. Love the concept of Hakka Indian Food. It's a cozy joint. Nothing fancy here. Chili sauces are on each table. Menu items are reasonably priced. If you enjoy spicy food, you will appreciate the dishes here. If they could just tone down the amount of oil when cooking and salt, it would be a solid 4 stars for me. 

Employees are friendly and quick. I appreciate that my Aunt brought us here."}
{"text":"Looking for a super cheap lunch?  Are you craving the taste of bland Hakka food?  Or maybe you just need an abundant amount of white rice?  If you answered yes to any one of those questions, then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"I used to love going here for their spicy dragon fish. It's so spicy I would be literally sweating but it's so good I can't stop eating. I moved out of Toronto recently and the last two times I went back, it isn't as spicy which really changes the taste. But the chow Mein and chilling chicken are great!!"}
{"text":"First time trying Spicy Dragon and we loved it. I didn't know the chicken came with a side of rice. We ordered the chilli chicken dry and vegetable fried rice for pick up. Came to $15. We haven't even touched the white rice. There's lots of fried rice left over, and that's after we had 2 platefuls! 
The restaurant is small but more modern looking than I expected. Not much parking and getting out of the parking lot is tricky. 
We will return."}
{"text":"My go-to lunch take-out joint and their $5.30 lunch specials can't be beat.

There are about 15 different lunch options, but I almost always get the Chili Chicken over Fried Rice. Chunks of chicken, over a bed of fried rice, and smothered with gravy. Their portions are big enough for two people, or save the other half for lunch the next day.

It can get pretty packed during the lunch hour, when the students from the high school flock to the plaza, and the wait can take up to 20 minutes. Call ahead, and you'll be in and out in 2 minutes."}
{"text":"Great food, always tastes good the next day too if you can't finish it all on the first meal. Prices are reasonable, and they allow you to call ahead and pre-order to help with the wait times for pickups. I like that it mostly fresh prepared when you order, not sitting in a tray waiting for someone to order it. I eat here frequently and have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Had a little date night tonight with a cute girl, went back for more Hakka Chinese tonight, but wanted to try some new items. 

- Manchurian shrimp and chicken rice (white meat)
- Chilli Chicken (dry, no sauce)
- Hot and Sour soup

My goodness the chilli chicken blew me away, phenomenal. Crispy, not greasy and very flavourful. Manchurian rice was excellent and the soup was also good. $21.75 with tax for two patrons and we had leftovers. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"We've dined at the Pickering location and have been wanting to try Scarborough's eatery for some time and did so this week. Firs off, extremely small dining room compared to Pickering, only about 5-6 tables available enough to seat 20-26 patrons max. Staff were very welcoming and seated us immediately, presented menus and glasses of cold water. Hot summer day so that was much appreciated. 

We had our usual: 1 plate of Chilli Chicken $8.75 (dry version without sauce), you can order a softer saucier version, but we like the crunch. With a plate of Manchurian Vegetable Fried Rice ($6.50)

Food arrived in about 15-20 minutes. Chicken was very delicious, crunchy, lots of kick with the green chillies. Rice very well done as well, huge portions! We were pretty full and had some leftovers to take home.  $17.21 total, we left a $20 with tip for the courteous and delightful service we received.

Overall great value for a dine out with delicious food. Now I know I don't need to travel all the way out to Pickering for some Spicy Dragon."}
{"text":"After eating the food at Epicurean at Niagara on the Lake today which was just awful (see my review), I wanted to eat some great food on the budget.  We've been to Spicy Drago because they are just AWESOME... They get 5 PLUS STARS FOR FOOD!! 5 PLUS STARS FOR PRICE!!  
This place is not the place to go on your first date.  This is a bare bone hole in the wall.  But the food is just SUPERB!!! We go there every week and they have never disappointed us.  The price is very reasonable but the portions are HUGE!!!  So if you go there, don't order too many dishes.  Oh and they give you 10% discount if you take out.  They are also very fast and each dish is made to order.  Nothing is microwaved or reheated.  They have the best Hot and Sour soup and at $6.50 for a big bowl that is enough for 4 people...that's a great deal.  
Their Spicy Dragon Chicken is to die for......Love this place."}
{"text":"A colleague always rants about this place, so I decided to pick up lunch from here today. I ordered Manchurian Chicken Chow mien and Chicken with Black bean Sauce. We ordered ahead of time and the order was ready when we got there. Takeout line moved fast enough. 

Food itself is just okay. Nothing to write home about.  

And that's that!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch one Wednesday afternoon as my buddy recommended this place. He highly recommended the chilli chicken with gravy but I typically order the dry for a more flavourful experience. So he ordered the one with gravy and I ordered the dry. The lunch special comes with your choice of meat served with steamed white rice and a bottle of water. For an extra $1.50, you can upgrade to egg fried rice, and an extra $0.50 for a can of pop. We also ordered shrimp pakora for our appetizer.

The shrimp pakora came out freshly fried, piping hot, served with a lemon wedge. For 12 pieces at $10.75, I can't say that I've seen a better pricing for a pakora dish. All the other pakora dishes can be found for under $10 for 12 pieces. What a steal! The shrimp pakora was delicious! Spicy! The only thing I'd like more of is actual shrimp. The amount of batter seemed to outshine the amount of shrimp but the flavour makes up for it.

Both the gravy and dry chilli chicken lunch specials were served in a generously large portion. As expected, the dry chilli chicken was more flavourful than the gravy chilli chicken but if you're one for saucy dishes to mix with rice, go for it. The dry chilli chicken paired nicely with the egg fried rice. I was surprised at how moist the fried rice was! I didn't need to drench the rice in sauce for it to be palatable as I usually do."}
{"text":"Blech! three of us bought the general tao, chicken wings, mixed vegetable cantonese chow mein and it was all so bad; so disappointingly gross. The general tao chicken was still moving on my plate. One chunk grabbed my wrist and was like... \"kill meee pleaaaase.\" so I slammed it into a to-go container so my cat could eat it later.  It didn't feel like I was chewing on chicken at all; honestly. The food looked very attractive but it was soo disturbing.  I gagged 4-6 times in front of my own grandmother.  I felt like I was on Fear Factor doing the 2nd challenge!  The worst part is that becuz there are so few Chinese food places in Pickering, people are tricked into thinking that spicy dragon is the best.  It breaks my heart.  The people next to us were like, \"this food looks amazing but there must be something wrong with MY taste buds cuz I taste chipmunk.\"  I wanted to flip the table and say, NO! you're damn taste buds are fine!!"}
{"text":"Not fancy because they don't need to be. The cuisine is known as Hakka Chinese, a marriage of Chinese and Indian flavour. I shared the experience with 3 Indian friends, one of whom is my wife, who should be awarded a PhD in both Cooking and Shopping. She loved it as did our 2 local friends, who suggested Spicy Dragon. We shared Hot and Sour Soup, Chicken Pakora, Manchurian Chicken, Szechuan Fish, and Shrimp Fried Rice. We loved it and still had leftovers. Service was very good and the price was fantastic. The bill came to a tad over $40 before tip. Well worth it .  .  .  and they have take out."}
{"text":"Worst Hakka place ever!!!
I have no idea why this was rated so high 
I was so excited to try their food, but was so disappointed after the first bite of chillie chicken. 
I ordered  Szechuan fried rice also and it had no salt, no taste what so ever."}
{"text":"We ordered 5 dishes and all of them were very bland and lacking flavor. The meat in the rice and the noodles was very dry. The pakoras had no salt and no taste.

Service was very slow and relatively non-existent except for someone who came to take our order. No one came by at all once the food came except when we asked for the bill. No one even refilled our empty waters.

I am not inclined to ever dine here again!

Hopefully they can improve on their customer service and their quality of food."}
{"text":"I could spend the entire review nit picking the faults of this little hole in the wall restaurant; but I think instead it would be better to expound on it's merits.

THE GOOD:
 - Restaurant seats about 20 people but whenever we've been there (lunch times during the week and weekends) we've been able to snag a table.
- Food comes out quick.
- Beef is tender 
- Generous amounts of big meaty, battered, deep fried shrimp in their dishes
- HUGE portions of their rice dishes
- Cheap weekday lunch specials (M-F 11am-2:30pm)
- Discount on take out orders if you pay cash

Yeah, we'll be back when were in the mood for spicy, reasonably priced Hakka food."}
{"text":"Great food! Portions are large, you can feed 4 people with $25! However....customer service is terrible! I've legit seen them yell at people and deny service to a pregnant woman before!! There is one woman that works the cash that has a hard RBF.... resting bitch face and doesn't come off welcoming at all. I'm Asian so I've never had a problem however my black friends don't always seem to have the best experience there... just saying"}
{"text":"I am normally a big fan of spicy dragon, their food is great, but I think they need to improve on their customer service. 

I called in at 6pm to put an order for a medium dry chilli chicken tray, for pick up at 9pm, I was told over four times that I have to come on time, and not to be late! I understand that they close at 10, so even if I come at 9.50, I should be fine. 

So I get there at 8.55pm, and when they asked for my info, it seems like they didn't even start on the order! That's when I started to get upset, as I was told numerous times that I have to be there \"on time\" and \"not late\". I received my order at 9.20, I really don't care about losing 20 mins of my life, I'm just upset that I was told four times not to be late, you need to trust your customer!"}
{"text":"Good quick eat if you're on a budget. Gives you great amount of food too so you definitely don't waste money. Used to eat here for lunch all the time when I was in high school.  Also remember it's just a quick eat. Not an amazing food place."}
{"text":"A solid $7.50 all in lunch special makes me happy. I had Hakka chicken chow mein, and a huge pot of green tea. Food was pretty tasty, maybe a little greasy. Came with an assortment of hot sauce condiments. Good stuff, I'll go back for more."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried chicken and fried rice. Both were extremely salty. As I was playing on my phone a waitress comes up to me and says can you turn down your phone...I'm like wtf I could barely hear anything and got my half eaten food and paid the bill.
Never will go back to that joint they are very rude and don't appreciate customers that just come to eat and leave."}
{"text":"Excellent place for Indian style Chinese.
Wouldn't recommend sitting down to eat... Take out would be better.
Very busy but worth it."}
{"text":"Craving Hakka style Chinese we quickly jumped on Yelp for some assistance. 

Was in the area and found this place to be within a 7 min drive. Thought we'd give it a shot as we love a good hole in the wall restaurant with decent reviews. 

Ambience - this place is small. Maybe seating for 12-15 at full capacity. Their take out business is obviously golden because there was a steady stream of phone calls and pick ups. In such a small space it's hard not to notice. 

Ordered the Black mushroom and broccoli along with the Chinese eggplant and hot and sour soup. 

Firstly - for such a small place, the first thing that jumped to mind is how long it takes to get your food. To be honest though, I was suffering from acute hangry-ness but even still - 20 mins is a bit too long. 

Crying babies, slaps of cold air from the single door was enough to distract but at the same time realize how slowly time was passing. 

About 20 mins in, I asked whether my soup was close to making it into my belly. After the request, the soup was in my belly in under 5 Mins. The hot and sour soup was ok. A little on the acidic style and not as smooth as other hot and sour soups as I've had. There was a certain tanginess that I didn't enjoy but I was starving, so down it went. 

Ordered the broccoli and black mushroom with less sauce and based on the eggplant dish, thank goodness that was the case. 

Broccoli was nicely steamed as we're the mushrooms. The sauce was tasty but quite salty. Overall though, still a healthy option. 

The eggplant, which my significant other ordered (with no restriction on sauce) was absolutely drenched in this goopy mess which anyone can do without. The eggplant itself was very flavourful and well cooked but the sauce was just excess. Why? I don't know. But it was blatantly obvious. 

Steamed white rice was nicely cooked and delicious. 

Overall, I had higher expectations based on reviews but it did not live up to my expectations. 

Service was mediocre at best. 

I don't think I'd return. There are definitely better places to eat in the area. 

Wait time: 4/10
Food: 5/10
Service: 4/10"}
{"text":"This place is so close to home and I stop here all the time to pick up food when I don't feel like cooking. Why have I not posted a review before?

I've always found the food to be good, in the better half of all the similar Hakka restaurants I've been to. I do, however, still have my favourite joints that I frequent. I sometimes find I have to add a bit more salt but maybe that's just my taste.

My orders have included Chili Chicken, Manchurian Chicken, Chicken Wings, Chicken Fried Rice, Crispy Beef, Hakka Chow Mein, Cantonese Chow Mein, Singapore Noodles, and a few other dishes. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are very generous, often enough for three servings. Great value!"}
{"text":"Quick, great Hakka Chinese Food. 

I was on the go and needed a quick lunch, this place is friendly, fast, and great tasting. They can be busy at times and parking can be a bit of an issue but it is well worth it whether you want to dine in or take out. Portions are well sized / large and inexpensive. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has the worse customer service ever. Food is average, if you combine that with the attitude of the staff, it's not worth it.  I will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you want to experience, in my humble opinion, the BEST Hakka food in the entire city, you must go here!

They do not waste time on decor, or any of that stuff, but their food speaks for itself...

The Spicey Dragon Chicken is the BEST dish on the entire menu...bar none, the best dish in the entire city!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite go-to Hakka places in Scarborough! The restaurant is relatively small but I usually get a takeout of their lunch menu's Shanghai noodles and Manchurian Chicken. The lunch menu is all I go for because the price is so reasonable! Also, they are super fast and making your order (less than 15 minutes if you order right when they open---they get busy fast!!!) I can't rate this 5 stars because the food quality could be slightly better. Sometimes the Shanghai noodles turn out a little too greasy and the Manchurian chicken tastes bland. Overall, if you're on a budget, looking for a quick spicy grab & eat, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"last weekend I ordered their noodle and beef stir fry and shrimp dish.. 
their spicy shrimp was awesome as always but the beef stir fry was blant... and was not cooked fresh... and same goes with their noodle...

they used to be good about a year ago but for some reason, their food doesn't have that taste anymore."}
{"text":"Horrible.

We went to this restaurant as it mentioned Indian Hakka Chinese but the reality of the food was totally different.

We ordered vegetable manchurian which came out to be  a tasteless medley of veggies. The chilli chicken with egg fried rice that my husband ordered was also tasteless.

Only the vegetable noodles and the Singapore rice noodles were tolerable (cus we were exceptionally hungry).

The best tasting thing was the coke can. 

Come here if you want to waste ur money and get a pathetic service as the hostesses are really rude. 

NOT RECOMMENDED EVER."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by pure coincidence. Was looking to go to screemers but was running later than my boyfriend and I thought. So we decided to try out this tasty little place for dinner. Omg we were sooooo pleasantly surprised. We had the Manchurian veggie fried rice, my boyfriend had the Manchurian crispy tofu (he's a vegetarian) and i had the Szechuan style chicken. We also ordered veggie spring rolls, and they were served nice and hot and oh so fresh. Tasted like they had just made them. This was one of the best Asian style meals I've ever had. The Szechuan chicken was delicious and so saucy. I could eat this all day. My boyfriend liked the tofu but he wished he had tried something else. What stole the show was the Manchurian veggie fried rice. This was the best rice ever. So flavourful and not greasy whatsoever. This is such a little gem of a hole in the wall 

The place was kinda full when we got there but we managed to get a seat after waiting about 10 mins. Our food was brought out super quickly and we got nothing but great service. Such a good little place, I bave nothing but good things to say about this place. Will definitely return just to try out new dishes"}
{"text":"This place is my big surprise and beyond my expectation. I work near there, just went there for a quick bite after work. To my surprise, the food is sooooooo good, I like their Shrimp in Lobster sauce and chili fish. I have lived in Toronto for 5 years and tried numerous Chinese western style restaurants,  most of them let me down. I could say for my taste, this one is the best among all the other similar ones in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for me.  Ive tried the spicy dragon chicken, house special chicken, chicken and shrimp hakka chow me in, corn soup, chicken pakora, crispy shrimp...etc etc.....really its all good.   It gets pretty spicy so ask for mild if are not good with heat.  If you are picking up CALL AHEAD.  10% off if you pay with cash!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really very torn about this place so I have broken it down into sections, this review is based on over a dozen expereinces with eat in and take out

Food:  I would give the food 5.5 stars. It is always fresh and the multiple items I have tried on the menu have been fantastic including the lemon chicken, hakka noodles and spicy beef.

Price/Value: We eat like kings for 28 dollars for dinner (three of us with drinks!).  How can you beat that!!!

Service:  I would give the service 1 star. The waitresses are really grumpy and curt. I have always had to approach the counter to order food then sit back down at my table.  You need to ask for everything, sometimes multiple times.  They simply ignore you...however not a big deal when the prices are so cheap!

Cleanliness:  I would give this a negative 5!!  This is where I really have an issue.  I understand that it is a typical hole in the wall kinda place, however there is just no excuse to have large cobwebs on the wall in the back corner table!  Flithy windows and walls and the corners of the floor are just gross.  In short I don't think the dinning room is ever cleaned at all....makes me wonder about the condition of the kitchen, hence my issue with this place...really great food at a great price vs. really dirty kitchen??????

In short, this is a great place to come and get take out...then leave.  Or if you decide to dine in please dont look at the walls, tables, floors, windows etc as it will really start to gross you out and you wont enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fast service every time, and at a reasonable price. 

Some of my usual go-to dishes are: 

Chicken Pakoras  - some of the best ones out there, they use great chunks of meat, and they are fried to perfection! Also the batter is Gram flour/ chickpea flour based, so if you're gluten free it's worth a try!

Veggie Hakka Noodles - good, but sometimes can be a bit soggy because the noodles themselves are a bit flimsy.

Chili Chicken with Gravy  - a staple! it has a lot of green chillies 

Manchurian Chicken with Gravy - Tossed in a Red Manchurian Sauce, it has a great taste and its not too spicy!

Veggie Fried Rice - it's honestly just as good as the Chicken Fried Rice, (they just substitute the chicken with Broccoli ) so if you have vegetarian with you, definitely get this to share!

Chicken Corn Soup - A Hakka Staple! It's a pretty mild soup with exactly as its described; chicken and corn.

Hot and Sour Soup - absolutely delicious! There is chicken in it, but I believe you can get it vegetarian as well. 

One thing I loved was that I was able to get the chicken fried rice made with less oil, and it was amazing. I'm definitely going to try asking for less oil when ordering all my dishes next time.

I have also catered a small party at home with food from Spicy Dragon Pickering twice and it was a great experience - highly recommend"}

For the Lunch Special, I usually stick to either Chilli Chicken, Manchurian Chicken or Chicken Fried Rice.

{"text":"Decided to check this place out and i have to agree with Rahim The Spicy Dragon Chicken was quite tasty.
Gotta say it's certainly not a classy joint but it sure makes up for it by giving you tasty food, good portions and a good choice of dishes.
From the time we walked in There was non stop traffic. For a small place the move more food than most restaurants on the block put together. Everybody's waking out with giant take out orders.
And looking around at my neighboring tables I'm gonna have to go back and try a few more dishes from their menu."}
{"text":"HUGE portions and so tasty!  Really great hakka and asian fusion!  Get the chicken or shrimp pakora!!"}
{"text":"Ordered spicy dry beef, Manchurian fish, Cantonese chow mein. Spicy goodness and chowmein is real authentic with big shrimps. Big healthy portions and excellent price. Definitely going back. Service also very friendly."}
{"text":"If you are willing to wait an unusually long time for food then this is absolutely the best hakka food in Pickering.   It is a close second to Scarborough's Fedricks.  The pakora, cantonese chow mein, and chili chicken are really good here.  The portions are significant relative to the cost.  I would have given it a 5 but I simply can't understand what takes them soooo long to prepare an order."}
{"text":"Ok, the place is nice setup nice and we'll situated but the food was average at best. The service was efficient and ready for my takeout but the food tasted more Chinese than Hakka. It wasn't even good Chinese  in my humble opinion. Iwas happy to find this in the area, but I was warned, don't buy Hakka from any neighborhood in Toronto - It should be bought in Scarborough or Richmond Hill. And in this case this was right."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of another Hakka joint and am a regular there, however I was driving by and saw this new restaurant, so I ventured in with my fiancé. One word - WOW!!! The food is not oily or salty and the portions are decent. I had to give this a 5 star because this is the best Hakka food I have ever had."}
{"text":"I am Hakka Chinese and I approve this message. 

Affordable, delicious, mouthwatering, family style Hakka food. If you haven't tried Hakka food yet, just stop by here and make it happen.

Chilli chicken with gravy. $8.25
Manchurian chicken. $8.25
Chilli beef. $8
Sweet and sour chicken. $7
Shrimp pakora. $9.75
Hakka chow mein. $7
Kan shue green beans. $6

I've been getting hakka take out for years from here even though I get it at home, sometimes you just need take out. You can call ahead and pick up. Or sit down at the restaurant.

Chilli chicken is the bomb. If youre new to this, get that and you'll never question Hakka food again. Also let them know how spicy you want it and they'll accommodate."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many times and had always thought to myself that I need to check it out. Durham region has quite a few Indian Chinese (Hakka) restaurants now and the bar has been raised.

After not getting into a restaurant I wanted since I didn't have a reservation, decided to come here instead.

Promptly greeted by servers. This was was quite busy on a Friday night.

To be honest the food was okay, I had the chilli chicken (3/5), Hakka Noodle (3/5), and the Spicy Dragon Beef (4/5). I have had better in Ajax and Whitby. 

It's good value for the money large portions as well. But had I been able to get into the first restaurant I wanted, probably wouldn't have come here."}
{"text":"I really liked that as soon as I entered the restaurant 3 servers from behind the counter were ready serve us. All of them greeted us in unison. The restaurant is laid out to be very long from the entrance to the counter, great thing the staff have laser vision and are attentive and fast.

Dined-in for 2. Ordered chili chicken and chicken pakora. Yes I like my chicken served Hakka-style. The chili chicken comes with a small bowl of steamed rice, drenched in gravy and onion. I had super high expectations as I don't play games when it comes to chili chicken, and unfortunately they were not met. Not spicy at all. Gravy was unlike other Hakka restaurants... less authentic to the original dish. Gets a 2/5. The chicken pakora on the other hand was delightful - I look for spice, colour, and cut of chicken they use when ordering pakora at restaurants as it will always be different. The colour was beautiful dark mustard yellow, jalapeños showing in the deep-fried breading. The chicken inside the pakora was juicy and neither too lean or fatty. Gets a 4.5/5.

An alright experience overall but in Pickering, beggars can't be choosers! Will eat here again and will re-order pakora."}
{"text":"Cheap and decent Hakka. Chilli chicken is great wet or dry, manchurian shrimp fried rice is good, beef with black bean sauce is proper.

Gotta be the #1 spot for quality/quantity for Chinese in Pickering and the fact that we have Hakka in the hometown saves me from driving to Federicks in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Came here several times it's ok some dishes are very spicy won't come here with family usually with buddy name Muza he loves this stuff I can say when he eat at this place he will eat like a champion."}
{"text":"A big yes to big portions esp the hakka noodle. Chili chicken is not as good as Lucky's but other food is contender. Paid $35 including tax for 2 orders of chicken hakka noodle, 1 spicy dragon fish and 1 chilli beef. 
Tip: portions are bigger dine in than take out."}
{"text":"This is the second location of this restaurant that I have tried. Ordered a couple dishes with extra spice and my hubby and i enjoyed the meal and all the leftovers immensely! Prices are quite reasonable and the food was delicious. Its a go-to in our household now!"}
{"text":"Only good Chinese restaurant I go to. The others sucks. This Chinese place has everything and Is fresh and affordable."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch.  We got vegetable pakora for an appetizer then pineapple chicken and Manchurian chicken. 

The food was quick, hot and cheap. Our server was friendly and came to our table quickly. 

There were 12 pieces of pakora in our appetizer and the lunch special portions were huge too.  Great value for money here."}
{"text":"I come here sometimes with my girlfriend. The serving quantities are very generous for the price, so much so that I normally save enough to have lunch the next day. The food tastes alright. The seating is pretty limited but there's normally a free space. The staff are helpful and the food comes out very quickly."}
{"text":"The noodles and spicy fish are really good, but the fat chinese women who serves has a really bad attitude problem and is very rude."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It's cheap and fresh! I go here once or twice a week and they never disappoint. Lunch special is like $6 and they give you plenty of food. Chili chicken is really good. The soups are not that good. Spicy dragon fish is amazing! Highly recommend if you like spicy food."}
{"text":"This was great for dinner time! Me and my friend got chilli chicken with gravy, Manchurian chicken fried rice, and beef with curry sauce. The service was fast and they didn't mind us sitting there chatting for an extra 40 mins ish after we were done eating. They're not stingy at all! Only thing was, they didn't have dessert. It was only around 8:30pm when we were eating so I don't really understand why they didn't have it? This hakka restaurant I'm definitely coming back to though!"}
{"text":"This place can be very inconsistent. Quality of food can be anywhere from 2-5stars. They have a really good lunch special that come with a drink for $6-$7. I find that the quality of chicken is different in the lunch special compared to when you order the same dish outside of lunch. They don't clean the meat as thoroughly during lunch I think because of the volume, a lot of fatty pieces in the chilli chicken. I've tried most of their menu and found consistency in only a few items. Chilli chicken, any rice dish. Everything else is a coin flip.  Don't dine in, service is trash. All the workers seem unhappy."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, lousy service. If you are looking to have a quick bite to eat and are in a budget I do recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is descent. It's a very small place, so there isn't a lot of seating. The owners lack any charm, of course, and I felt like I was bothering them, but the prices are not that bad, and the portions are big."}
{"text":"If you want reasonably priced Chinese/Hakka food then spicy dragon is the place to be.  They have a wide selection of dishes to choose from and they also serve good portions and it doesn't break your wallet."}
{"text":"This is the second location of Spicy Dragon (Original in Scarborough). If you like Hakka Food (everything spicy and flavorful). Owners are very nice and food is excellent. The best Chili Chicken in Toronto GTA. They also do catering platters but best to go in person to order. The best part is this place will not break your bank!"}
{"text":"Great food I tend to take out instead of eat in. But eating in isn't so bad. One of the best places to for Hakka food.

I usually order chicken. The best dishes are sweet and sour chicken, chilli chicken with gravy, and general Tao."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight. The place is really small, crazy packed on a Friday evening (take out and dine in). 

We ordered a decent amount of food. Spicy dragon chicken, shrimp Kung pow, chilli chicken, rice, vegetable stir fry and Singapore Noodles with beef. 

The chilli chicken was on point! Really really good. Got the \"dry\" option, was quite spicy. Spicy dragon chicken sucked, wasn't flavourful. Singapore and all else was mediocre/same as you would get anywhere else. 

All that food for $50. 10% off orders $15 or more. No delivery. 

3/5 in my books. Would return for the chilli chicken!"}
{"text":"Only had the chili chicken here and it was delicious.   I'm a moderate spicy food eater and I can take the heat for this dish.  I should come back to try other things.  The only Hakka dish I know is chili chicken...."}
{"text":"The ladies before are more helpful than this new chinese lady. Ohh they are both chinese LOL"}
