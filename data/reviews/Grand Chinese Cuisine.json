{"text":"Good Dim Sum but validation for parking didn't work had to pay 12.00 to park."}
{"text":"Not a typical ameican chinese food restaurant.  Light and not oily but filling.  Really liked the crispy beef and the scallops."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review.  

The food here is excellent - finely done and well made.  My favourite dish is the \"creamy egg with scallops on stir fried rice noodles\" (Sorry, don't recall the English name - that is my description of the dish).  In general, the food is well cooked and nicely presented.    

However, and this is a big however, while everything is well done, it is simply not memorable enough to warrant a higher star rating.  The menu is limited and nothing jumps out.  Our family has been to this place many time, and at our most recent visit (for dinner) several days ago, found ourselves thinking that we might not be back for a while given the rather bland offerings.  The portions are also small and expensive.    

Also, the washrooms are quite dumpy for a restaurant of this calibre - dark and wet (!!!).  They really need to fix this up, and soon.  What a way to ruin a nice meal.  

Service, on the other hand, is unbeatable.  I would recommend this place to any person who has a few extra dollars to spend and wants a reliable and well-waited meal."}
{"text":"I come here a lot with my family. It is definitely the best Chinese dim sum place in Mississauga area. It is also almost the only fine dine Chinese restaurant in Mississauga. 

All their dim sum are delicately made and presented. Almost all of them have a unique twist to it, so it is slightly different from the regular dishes that you can get at any traditional Chinese restaurant. For example, the rice roll with fried dough inside, they added stuffings to it instead of just rolling up the fried dough with the steam rice paper. The beef ball also taste very good, more tradition, but they garnish with mushroom. I also like their friend shanghai rice cake a lot.  What I like is their food is not as greasy overall and less filled with MSG.

They change part of their menu once in a while...good and bad. If you come here very often, you won't get tired of the items because they will add new items. But, if you do really like certain items and they took it of the list, that can be very disappointing and frustrating.  I like their stuffed eggplant, but they no longer make it anymore...I was quite sad for a while.

Their services are excellent too. I guess its because they are located in a hotel, and more of a Chinese Fine Dine place. If you drive, they will validate your parking ticket, just remember to give it to them when you pay for your bill.  If you pay by cash, they will also give you discount vouchers for your next visit, which is equivalent to 10% of your bill that day. So,it's like 10% off next visit."}
{"text":"Overall the dim sums are good. They are a bit pricey but it is compromised with good food quality."}
{"text":"This is not your average Chinese food this place had some of the best quality food i have had in north america and im not exadurating. Food is a bit pricy but well worth it"}
{"text":"WORST DIM SUM ever!!! I am serious. The quality is worse than food court dim sum? am I making sense? Way too pricy for the type of quality. 

1) deep fried stuffs are oily 
2) shrimp har gao tasted sour which means left it out for too long
3) steam beef smells very meaty - abnormal smell 

Service is normal so I tipped the waitress fairly even though the food is not good at all. Definitely ruined my weekend lunch couple weeks ago!"}
{"text":"Buried within the Double Tree Hotel by the Airport this restaurant seems to survive on five star tour bus traffic and weddings.  Perhaps weekend traffic is heavy too since some menu items are \"weekend only\".  If five star tours and Asian weddings use this restaurant why wouldn't it be high quality?

I shared the dinner for two (never usually doing this at a Chinese restaurant I felt it was an easy way to sample more of their menu).  Half lobster was cooked and seasoned perfectly, chicken was juicy, well seasoned and lightly fried.  Beef dish was rare and melted like butter with fried rice.  Starter of corn and crab soup was sweet and not overly salty.  Best of all everything was served HOT unlike many places where the food seems premade.

I don't know if many non-Asians eat there unless they are staying at the hotel.  They asked twice if we could manage with chopsticks - another good sign in my books.  Stop in after your next flight to Pearson."}
{"text":"I live out in the east end of North York, and yet my parents will brave the 401 traffic to specifically come here for lunch (and the occasional dinner) whenever they feel like lunching out. Their dim sum is some of the best in the city, and they are very flexible here. If you want a lobster for lunch (usually considered a dinner item) they have no problem making it for you. 

Their weekend dimsum menu is better (there are more items on it) but you'll have to brave the crowds of locals that come out for lunch. It's located in the back of the Doubletree Hotel, and they will validate your parking ticket for 2 hrs free parking if you dine in the restaurant. It's a bit on the pricy side, but worth it.

The service is always excellent and food is always beautifully presented and delicious."}
{"text":"ahh I give them 1 star because the egg rolls were horrible.  Serious?  Bad eggs rolls at a chinese rest?

Main dish was good, but not enough to save the egg roll issue.

Finally, they served me an expired (by 10 months) Coke Zero.  Maybe my fault for ordering a coke zero."}
{"text":"Food: No good

Service: Extreme unfriendly especially the guy greeting customer at the door. None of the employee has a smile on their face.

Price: Very over priced

Decor: Simple. Chairs were comfortable."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for dim sum in the west end - there aren't that many choices but this is way up there even when compared to places in Richmond Hill and Markham. I would say it is almost as good as Lai Wah Heen when you consider that the price is less overall.

I have never been here for dinner so my review is only for their dim sum.  I came here after reading a lot of positive reviews on sites like Chowhound. I was not disappointed! The food is consistently fresh and of good quality. This is not your greasy, cart pushing dim sum restaurant - it is a lot more refined.  It is pricier than your average dim sum but that's because the food is above average. Everything I ordered tasted wonderful and presentation is excellent as well. My favorite dishes are the turnip cakes and the cod pastries. The service is excellent too. 

I love this place! And it's close to me too which makes it even better! After eating here and Lai Wah Heen and Lai Toi Heen, it's hard to go eat at places where they are still pushing around carts or serving greasy cold subpar dim sum."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekday with one person.  We ordered Peking duck along with two appetizers since I was very hungry. 

The Peking duck came out about 15 minutes before the appetizers. The Chinese crepes were made in-house and delightful but the duck was disappointing.  It was extremely fatty. Also, they did not seem to know how to slice off just the skin as the cut chunks of meat with the skin. I was surprised they had any meat left for the second course. 

The dim sum was very good. We ordered their siu mai with caviar and the rice rolls with grouper & spinach. I would return for their dim sum but I will not likely order the peking duck again."}
{"text":"Been to the Grand a few times for both dim sum and dinner.  With a diminishing number of decent Chinese restaurants in west GTA, the Grand is better than most.  They're known for putting a little spin and pizazz to their dim sum dishes through presentation as well unique flavour profiles.

Their quality of ingredients is good, but I personally like my dim sum the classic old school way: loud, grimy, non stop glass clinking, packed full of people with simple traditional recipes.  

Things like the Thousand Layer Cod pastry, Pumpkin and Pork bun and others are standouts and show the technical skill of the kitchen.  But again, I've always felt dim sum doesn't need to be styled as pretty as they do.  

Perhaps a little too refined for me? Is that even a fair criticism? I'm stubborn about this.

For dinner, I feel that most of my meal was relatively forgettable.  The best dishes of the night were definitely the Roast Duck and the Roast Chicken.  Both were cooked perfectly, the skin crispy and delicious with enough underlying fat to moisten each bite.  Everything else was meh.

It's a shame that this place has been half empty every time I've gone.  It's a little pricier than most places, almost $1-2 more per dim sum dish.  High quality of food, a specialty for sure.  Just not my thing."}
{"text":"This is a very good dim sum place as far as taste and value are concerned. Our family went out for a farewell dim sum tea and we got some very delicious orders. My personal favorite was the spicy duck feet and har gao. The service is prompt and attentive. I would definitely come back here.

On a side note, it's not obvious you can park for free since the restaurant is located within a hotel complex, but rest assured it was possible (we didn't want to tempt a tow-away). 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"Good food! We were really impressed. Everything we ordered was delicious! Highly recommend this place if you want a great Chinese food."}
{"text":"A fancy dim sum place, even the lazy susan was made of glass with a frosted design.  One of the locals being tour guide read about it on Chowhound and suggested we try it out especially since many of us were limited on time since we had planes to catch and couldn't venture too far from the airport area. Who knew a hotel could house a decent dim sum place. The restaurant is on the fancier side but it had to be good since I saw Asians eating there.  Grand has no dim sum carts, so we had to order from a menu, which means no pointing or \"fast\" food, so remember the names of your dim sum items. Went on Sunday afternoon and they had their weekend menu. They had typical dim sum items but some came with a twist or a new fusion. Everything was presented well. The turnip cake was good and it was wrapped in nori. Both the har gau and siu mai were excellent and ingredients were good quality. The Shanghai dumplings were just okay, that was the only so-so items we ordered off the menu.  Our party also ordered other items and they were all pretty tasty. 

The sweets-The sweet potato is more of a block than custard and it's the purple kind, not bad I would order just one though.  The egg tart was really good and the crust was nice and flakey. The deep fried rice balls with black sesame were also good. 

Grand is on the pricey side though. They do take reservations."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Saturday out of boredom and wanted something new to try out. For $60 between my friend and I, we were stuffed and the food was very good. Definitely worth the money. The only downside is the wait time. It can take up to half an hour to get some dishes even though it was not indicated on the menu that it would take a while (as with some of their more exotic items). Overall, good experience and would do it again!"}
{"text":"In the hotel for a business meet and was stuck inside due to weather conditions. I don't normally eat in hotel restaurants but this one was life changing. 

I ordered their Peking duck and chicken fried rice and it was absolutely amazing.

They could use some English speaking waiters though. I guess that adds to the experience for a Chinese restaurant ;)"}
{"text":"A great surprise in an area with not a lot of options.
You would never really expect an authentic Chinese Dim Sum joint in a hotel, but what you get is good quality eats.  I ordered off the Dim Sum menu and every bite was really good.

The food was prepared fresh and not from a frozen party tray!

The kitchen did mess up my order and delivered the wrong dish.  The waitress fixed the situation with no issue.

I would go there again, if i am ever in the area."}
{"text":"For those of you who frequent Chinatown or Markham for dim sum, don't look at this place as another shitty, half-assed hotel restaurant. It is a true gem in Toronto.

This place is so good, I came here for dinner AND dim sum the next morning.

Dinner:
For soup, we had shark fin soup, which was made with some melons and cucumbers. Out of the ordinary, but fresh regardless.
Deep-friend jumbo prawns were actual huge, fried balls (no pun intended) and they were delicious with mayonnaise. We also had the lobster which, if you have a sensitive tongue for spices, you shouldn't get this because my mouth was on fire after one bite! 
I recommend the egg white with shredded conpoy fried rice for a change because it's actually more flavorful than you'd think, especially with the dried conpoy on top.
We also had the lobster which was delicious but I couldn't go on after 2 pieces because the red chili pepper was really strong. 

Dim Sum:
The dim sum was pretty standard. It was more about the presentation with the nice, old-style dishes rather than the food.
The turnip cake was cut into pieces and wrapped with seaweed like sushi but could have been better if it was pan fried a little longer.
Har gau and shrimp rice noodles were both great. Might need to add some extra soy sauce since it's not as salty. 
The lotus leaf wrap had the cutest presentation because they were wrapped like coin bags but the inside was pretty dry and I didn't enjoy it overall. 

Wish I had the chance to try their dessert but I was long stuffed. The place is really high-end for Chinese but worth the splurge if you'd like to experience a new take on Chinese food."}
{"text":"The Gist: Located in the Doubletree by Hilton and close to the airport this would seem a strange choice to most, but as the first stop on an eight day trek taking us from Toledo to Montreal and back by way of Toronto and Ottawa the west Toronto location was not only convenient but I had on good word of mouth from a trusted palate well experienced with Chinese cuisine that the food was quite good as well.  

The Why: As above, plus some more \"Americanized\" options for my mother and aunt who are generally not tremendously adventurous when it comes to authentic ethnic cuisines.  Certainly meant to appeal to both Asians living in the Toronto area and clientele staying at the hotel the diversity of the menu was impressive and unlike many similar restaurants a good website assured my family that there would be choices for them as well.

The Reservation:  As we were entering Canada via the nearly impossible to predict Ambassador Bridge no reservation was made and given the location both outside of town and in a hotel we arrived to find the restaurant 3/4 empty.

The Space: While I am no expert on Chinese cuisine, the room seemed rather typical from my limited experience with tables and chairs covered in flowing materials, the carpet an ornate floral pattern, and fish tanks in back displaying live fish available to be cooked to order.  Music was light woodwinds and chimes and with the central dining area slightly raised on a spiral ramp a small bar with top shelf alcohol sat near the hostess podium where a few businessmen were enjoying cocktails while browsing their laptops.  Interestingly, to those who take note of such things, I will additionally note that restrooms were spotless and with the kitchen largely visible through open doors the entirety of the restaurant was much cleaner than any of the places we visited in BC.

The Service: From our check-in at the hostess station to the end of the meal service was professional - smiling even - and with half the items ordered from the dim sum portion of the menu while the rest were ordered from the main menu there was never \"too much\" at once on the table.  As an added bonus, both water and tea were refilled frequently throughout the meal and plates were cleared as they were finished to make room for more.

The Food:
Baked Diced Cod Fish Pastry in Thousand Layer:  Fairing far better than the shrimp rolls, this was perhaps the best dim sum selection to date as each of the three multi-layered pockets shattered on mastication giving way to juicy chunks of fish seasoned with pepper and herbs.  Impressively crunchy and without a hint of grease due to baking rather than frying this was on bar with some of the best cod 'fritters' I've ever tasted - a stark contrast to the sometimes greasy brandade versions.

Deluxe Steamed Barbecue Pork Bun:  When asked what made these \"deluxe\" the waiter explained to us that it was the use of abalone sauce as opposed to Barbecue and while I at first hesitated I will have to admit that this was inspired.  Starting first with the tender bready dumplings and moving right on to the large chunks of supple swine there was no skimping on the ingredient quality here and with the focus of the sauce leaning more towards the savory than the sweet the end effect was really quite lovely, a sort of soy and spice flavor with just a touch of funk overlying the pork.

Freshly Baked Egg Tart in a Puff Pastry Shell Dusted with Swallow's Nest:  My first experience with Swallow's nest, though honestly it was not at all the reason I ordered this dish; in reality I simply love egg tarts and despite being served on a flimsy plastic carrier these were incredible.  Served warm, bordering on hot, with the pastry golden and flaky but not 'crisp' while the custard was still jiggly but not runny each sweet bite simply melted on the palate with creamy sweetness and a light tinge of salt and butter on the finish...without a doubt a must order.

Deep Fried Duckling Stuffed with Shrimp Mousse and Almond:  My 'main course' of the afternoon, and more along the lines of what my mother was expecting when she ordered \"fried chicken\" this was a truly unexpected and exciting dish where the kitchen had taken the liberty to pound crisp confited duck flat before matching it with creamy shrimp paste, and quickly deep frying it in batter studded with sliced almonds.  Something like a fried pate or rillet in texture and rested across young green asparagus sliced lengthwise this was a dish I've never seen before on any menu anywhere and all-in-all utterly delicious.

The Verdict: A resounding win for everyone involved with each of us walking away impressed by not only the food - never oily, low on salt and MSG, and full of flavor - but the room and the service.  While obviously not the most authentic, cheapest, or convenient to those residing in the greater Toronto area this was the sort of place where \"something for everyone\" did not mean compromising quality."}
{"text":"I'm typically a person who likes more casual, less expensive types of places...so take it for what it's worth.  The prices start at $16 U.S. and go up to $25-30.  There is no cheaper lunch menu.  My food was very good.  Service was below par but that's cause we were there at 3pm.  I'm not especially big on service.  Cost was $6 more than what I'd be happy with.  This is not a place that attracts big crowds....ie, great food, cheap, napping place.  Atmosphere was nice.  Next time....I'd pick a different place."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Considered one of the 'higher end' dim sum places in Toronto, they combine both classical and imaginative dishes for a unique dim sum experience.

Cost:
-A bit more than your regular dim sum place, but not as expensive as LWH 
-$4/5/6 for S/M/L dim sum dishes.

Atmosphere/Decor:
-Tucked away in the nondescript Double Tree Hotel near the airport, everything is covered in yellow and gold table clothes and chair coverings.
-This place is one of the brightest, cleanest and fanciest Chinese restaurants in town!

Ordered:
-Follow this link for a lengthy and photographic breakdown of most items on the menu: http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/557688

1. Of particular note are the foie gras fried dumplings and the steamed beef ball.

2. The presentation of most dishes is much better than any other Chinese restaurant and really enhance the experience of eating carefully prepared dishes instead of the usual 'fast food dim sum' experience.

3. Of somewhat of a disappointment were the shrimp dumplings (the gold standard of any dim sum place): the skin was too thick and therefore wasn't steamed to an appropriate translucency, and the shrimp, whilst fresh, was overcooked and mildly 'mushy'.

Service:
-Some of the most courteous and professional staff.
-Depending on how busy it is, the food may take a while to arrive.
-You get three hours free parking if you show them your parking ticket.

Conclusion:
-A good, but not great, dim sum place that I'll definitely be going back to have their more creative dishes."}
{"text":"This is one of the few standout restaurants of the far West End.  Tucked away in the bowels of the Doubletree Hotel, it's easy to pass up simply because it's so well hidden, and the airport area's really not known for its food.  This place is a total gem: while the service can be oddly snooty and disinterested at times, and some of the mains are average, the dim sum's wonderful and in my experiences in Toronto, second only to Lai Wah Heen downtown.

Fair warning: I've only dined her twice.  Which is to say, I've seen virtually none of their extensive menu.  I had a perfunctory but largely forgettable General Tao here, but I've heard good things about their more traditional, less Americanized dishes.  Beyond that all I've eaten is the dim sum, all of which was very good.  Some standouts, in the menu order:

Har Gau, Crystal Prawn Dumpling - This isn't the most exciting item on the menu, but for me it's a must, and they do an exceptional version here.  There are bunches of whole shrimp in these things, giving the filling has a wonderful texture.   The skin of the dumpling is chewy and tender.  It would be easy to skimp on such a common offering, but they've really gone all-out here to do a great job on what's often a boring standby. 

Siu Mai, Pork Dumpling With Scallop and Fish Roe - This is exactly as it sounds, and it's delicious.  An oversized perfect piece of siu mai, each dumpling is topped with a thinly-sliced piece of scallop that adds a bit of silky texture and light flavor, which is in turn topped with salty fish roe that adds an element of crunch.  It's really good.

Deluxe Steamed Barbecue Pork Bun - Fluffy white buns with cloud-like consistency, each packed with a ton of rich, sweet, barbecued pork.  Simple and delicious, it's one of the best barbecue pork buns in the city.

Sticky Rice Filled With Assorted Meats Wrapped And Steamed In Lotus Leaf - I often find that in this dish, the lotus flavor overpowers everything else, leaving the meat filling to taste like a flavorless mush.  Not so here, as the lotus flavor plays well with the filling to create a rare harmony.  

Steamed Coconut Flavour Bun - These are sweet, light, fluffy, and delicious.  They're also kind of big, so be aware of that when you're ordering them.  I saved these for last the first time I had dim sum here, and since portions all around were larger than I expected, it was like I was force-feeding myself tasty dessert clouds.  I felt like Kirby.  But yeah, they're good!

Pan Fried Bun With Minced Chicken And Pumpkin In Black Bean Garlic Sauce - Mother of god, speaking of things that were surprisingly large... These buns are, by dim sum standards, huge.  They're also PACKED with hefty ingredients; they've got a sort of salty exterior, and then inside you hit the savory chicken and the subtle sweetness of the pumpkin.  These are a big highlight for me, but yeah - they're large, and they're heavy.  Don't order this thinking you're getting a light fluffy steamed bun.  These things have alot of body to them, and a ton of flavor.  I highly recommend them.

I could've sworn I had some sort of crab dumpling here, too.  But I'm not seeing it on the menu.  If it did exist, and I wasn't just having the Chinese cuisine equivalent of acid flashbacks to a previous trip to Lai Wah Heen, I'm sure it was great.  None of the dim sum here missed the mark.

This place is great and doesn't get nearly the press it deserves.  If you're ever trapped eating by the airport, make Grand Chinese your go-to."}
{"text":"Grand Chinese Cuisine is a good choice if you are in the airport area or West of Toronto.

But as someone like me that lives near Markham and Richmond Hill, I doubt I would make a special trip just to eat there.

We ordered a few dishes to share:

- Pan fried jumbo oysters with peppered honey glaze
- Zhen Jiang Spare Ribs in Cassrole ($14.95)
- Marinated Free Range Chicken
- Braised Bean Curd Sheet Rolls Topped with Egg White ($14.95)
- Pea shoots topped with shredded Conpoy and Enoki mushrooms
- Stir Fried Sticky Rice

Most of the dishes were just average and quite forgettable. I had better versions of those dishes somewhere else. Aside from the Braised Bean Curd Sheet Rolls Topped with Egg White! Love the different textures and elements. The egg white stir fried to perfection and so buttery!!

Deco is nice and service was decent. I won't expect less from a fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"Grand Chinese Cuisine is probably the best Chinese restaurant on the West End of Toronto/GTA.  Which isn't saying much because there's not a lot of choice in the area!  However, all that to say - come here for the dim sum.  They have a lot of really unique dishes (i.e. dumplings with foie gras, duck tongue in jelly, rice tubes with corn and shrimp.... etc.)  Dinner here can be good and they have some great set menus... which only appear to be available if you understand Chinese.  Service is also very good, and this is probably one of the cleaner Chinese restaurants you'll come across. However, this of course is made up by the fact that it's more expensive than most Chinese restaurants.  Also, beware of staying longer than 3 hours, the parking lot will charge you something like $4 an hour.  Sheesh!"}
{"text":"Such a hidden Gem in Toronto area. I have not had such legit Dim Sum for almost 4 years. It is even better than some good dim sum place in NYC. Like I said, to have an authentic Chinese, the best way is to follow your heart and disregard yelper's opinions.

Located: inside the International Plaza, at the very end of the hall way, Grand Chinese cuisine takes lots of steps to arrive there. But once you were there, you would be fascinated by its chinese decoration and nice decor around. We were treated nicely and quickly by the waitress and seated. We was not in a mood of Dim Sum but when they offered our dim sum menu, we were like \"okay, whatever.\"

Food: Let's be specific: we had weekday dim sum menu. The # we had are: 101, 102, 112, 122, 152. You might be surprised that we were full by only 5 dishes. But we were. 152 is a soup, with tofu and duck. Both my parents and I were happily finished this soup quickly because it's too declisiou to be described. Others are delicious as well. 101 is made by fresh big shrimp. 112 is fresh chicken feet. 122 is fairly crispy as well. If you were doing a short stop in Toronto, this is a good stop to have some legit chinese dim sum.

Service: well mannered and well served. They are trained well nothing like other unprofessional chinese restaurant with rude waitress and waiters.

Overall: too good to be true. I think they really show some good manners of chinese cuisine and this is somewhere i will defintely introduce to my friends if they want to really explore chinese cuisines."}
