{"text":"Decent grocery store. I wish they had better selection of frozen foods with larger portions. But great place to pick up things for meals. I shop primarily at Costco so this is my second go-to.  Jim has been an outstanding employee here. I see him a lot when I go to shop and his service is phenomenal. It's always a pleasure seeing him whenever I drop by for food."}
{"text":"So glad they put a Albertsons here after the previous chain went out of business.  The staff is exceptional and welcoming.  I won't be shopping anywhere else.  The produce is fresh and the bakery and deli selection is great!  To top it all off they have a Wells Fargo inside."}
{"text":"What's happening? I love this store but in the last month they never have the items or they left items off their order. For example, 24-48 oz Marie Calendar's meal pie--they didn't know about it but coupon came out of the weekly flyer; Lucerene whipped cream--buy 2 for $3.00. Only 1 available to buy. Last week it was another item.   Someone is apparently NOT DOING THEIR JOB! Wake up!"}
{"text":"I went to this store twice while I was on vacation in Vegas and I did not have any problem.  The store is fairly big and have good amount of selections.  Everything is stocked neatly.  They also have Wells Fargo window bankers and 24hr ATM, which my friends heavily depended on."}
{"text":"I like Alberstons for their sushi rolls, and the starbucks inside is really convenient.  However, their prices are OUT of control. Get ready to spend, for the same old  regular things. I paid almost $6 for a 0.3 ounce of allspice. $6! Everything there is over priced, take an extra few miles and go to Smith's."}
{"text":"The prices are outrageous here! This is also the second time I've come here and they had the same item in different places marked with different prices or I get up to check and the sale price doesn't come up. I never have to worry about that at Smith's and the coupons are all digital see you don't have to dig for paper in your purse. They make it really difficult here and I think they are sneaky to try to get more money out of people. Some of their healthier foods, I found them cheaper even at stores that usually would charge more for that stuff I don't think I'll be shopping here again."}
{"text":"I'm done with this location despite it being the most convenient. I spend less time shopping for groceries than I do waiting in line. I understand that sometimes the customer delays the process, but their is no sense of urgency and not much friendliness from the employees. Not only in the check out line, but the deli employees as well. I asked for 1/2 of a pound of cheese and was given over 3/4 of a pound. Checkers have bagged meats with vegetables, common sense 101. Stella Artois was on sale and when I went to buy it the checker couldn't get it to ring up, come to find out it's on recall and yet it's there on display to buy. I could continue, but you get the point."}
{"text":"Very clean and well stocked store. Plus they have a Starbucks located inside for all you coffee lovers."}
{"text":"I have never actually been in the store. I go to this Albertson's to refill my water bottles.   So this ***REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE GLACIER WATER REFILL AREA***.   It's always clean around the area. It's a little far away from the store but it serves its purpose.   The last time I went, the machine would not accept my money. Just kept spitting the coins back out.   In Colorado, the Glacier water machines take credit cards. Maybe u all should update. It is 2013."}
{"text":"I come to this one everytime I go to an albertsons... but today was very interesting... I gather all my items and head to a checkstand.. I see one with no line. So I proceed to it. The cashier (janele) has her back turned to me talking to another employee. I start putting my things on the belt. She doesn't even know im there cause she's yapping away to the other employee. So I move up and touch the sensor to the belt so it would start moving my stuff to the front. She still doesn't see me... so finally the other employee points and I'm sitting there like yah hi... anyways... janele never once greeted me... never smiled.. or asked how I was or if I found everything ok... She proceeded to yap away.... and I mean she was pissed... She kept saying \"I close this line right now and we'll go sit and talk in the office cause I wanna know who the hell told you That. That pisses me off so much.\" Never once acknowledged that I was there... She probably said the same thing 5 times just over and over again... I have never felt so uncomfortable in my entire life.... I felt like I was interrupting her... so I pay and she hands me my receipt and that's it. Never said thanks, bye, have a good day nothing.... it was so unprofessional to get mad like that in front of a customer... I am a cashier also and we are taught to never leave the customer out of a convesation so they feel involved, and like your paying attention go them... that definatley was not the case here... I felt like I should have been in a different line. After all this I remebered walking out that I forgot to put my number in for the coupons... this chick gave me so much anxiety from constantly repeating her self saying how pissed off she was and yelling and this and that that I forgot to put my number in... so I go to the returns line and the employee helping me there (janet) I think her name is, tattoos on her arms helps me (She was also the other employee janele was venting to.) So I tell her I'm so sorry she made me feel so uncomfortable I forgot to do this and so she understood and gave me my refund.. these stars are not for janet... She was great.. She kept telling janele to stop.  And janele got mad when she told her to stop because of me being there... anyways.. I won't be returing to this store any longer... this grocery trip turned into a huge anxiety, stress case for me. And that is not something I need when coming to go grocery shopping. She should have held her composure and dicussed this until in the office.... and not been so unprofessional letting it all out in front of a customer.... horrible..."}
{"text":"Worst grocery store I have ever had the misfortune of being stuck with. Run down, dirty, and sketchy. For many years they didn't even have hand baskets because they said that they stopped ordering them because people would steal them. Now they have the red MoneyGram baskets in (probably because MoneyGram gave them to Alberstons for free). Cashiers are extremely slow. They reduced their hours a couple years ago, and now they are only open 6 a.m. to midnight. After a certain hour in the evenings (I think it's 9:00), they block off certain entrances and force everyone through one entrance. Food in dairy section is often expired or very close to it. It was at least tolerable when they had the self checkout aisles, but they recently removed them. Now the checkout lines are extremely long, and what should be a 10 minute stop at the store has doubled in time.   The only reason this store is still open is because of its location and the captive audience it has as a result. People who live in this area do not have many other choices. Smith's up the street is just as bad, and Target simply doesn't have the grocery selection (though at this point I'm willing to forgo variety for a clean store in which I feel comfortable and welcome).  I cannot wait until a grocery store is built in Cadence and this place can be put out of its misery."}
{"text":"This was my experience upon exiting this store today Sunday 4/8/2018 at about 1:00 pm. A piece of crap red jeep was parked in the same lane as I was.  A man was sitting inside with the driver door wide open.  As I walked behind this jeep he revved his motor very, very aggressively.  Dust and smoke spewed out of the tailpipe right in my direction.   This vehicle doesn't even look like it should be on the road.  How do they pass smog tests?  So now you can't even walk out of a store without getting harassed this way. So I just want to warn other shoppers about this in this lot.  The vehicle was already running...it's not like he just started it up at that time.   Then a few minutes later he drives out right past me."}
{"text":"Wow! What a horrible dirty store! I live in the area and have been coming here for years but this has gotten ridiculous.  High prices, horrible produce and meats.  The service at the cash registers is terrible too. The lady helping me tonight was acting like I was just being a huge inconvenience by shopping there.  And while I was there on a Sunday evening at 6 pm someone tried to rob the store.  Do not come here! Anywhere else will be better than this place!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst store in the world! They are fortunate that they are the ONLY supermarket in Boulder City or no one would shop here. They bait & switch with their pricing - advertising low competitive prices as long as you buy 5 or 10 at a time. One week a product can be $2.50, the next $4.50. Stay away from this rip- off joint if there's any way possible ."}
{"text":"So glad Albertson's open again .. It's super nice on the inside .. They repainted the parking lot .. Put a clear varnish on the side walk to make it look nice new shopping carts .. I'm thrilled it open again and we will soon have Starbucks back !!!!!"}
{"text":"Forgive me, as I have been meaning to post this review for over a month now...  This is the closest Albertson's to my house, and yet I rarely go there. I find the prices to be too high compared to the other grocery stores in the area. And after my last visit I do not plan on going back.   My husband and I stopped in on July 3rd to pick up a couple specific items we needed for the upcoming holiday. One of the items we purchased was some mozzarella cheese.   It wasn't until I was home and I looked closer at the package that I realized the cheese we purchase had expired... BACK IN MARCH. Ugh. I could somewhat understand having expired products on the shelves if it was a matter of a couple days.. MAYBE even a week. But four months? That is unexcusable in my book and makes me wonder what other expired items are being sold at excessive prices.  Never again Albertsons."}
{"text":"Very comfortable store.   This store is a bit older...it still has the turnstile when you come in the door. I never liked these. However, the store is very clean and well stocked. I'm not sure why this is marked as '$$$$', it is definitely not expensive.   I have to say that I was only in the freezer section and the liquor section, so that is what I am basing my review on today.   The liquor section is huge. I was surprised to see how much wine they have here. The checker was very friendly, and the parking lot is large and spacious. I like this location a lot."}
{"text":"Certainly not the lowest price supermarket, but they do have some good specials occasionally. My biggest complaint is not specifically towards this store, but all Albertson stores in general...as all Albertson stores removed all their self check out registers....which means, if you only have a couple of items to buy, your still forced to wait in long lines at the regular cashiers."}
{"text":"This was our daily stop to pick up sandwiches, ice and other fun stuff before heading out to Lake Mead. They have some really cheap and delicious pre-made sandwiches, we ate those most days on the lake, but we also tried their fried chicken which was actually pretty good. I remember getting fried chicken from Albertsons growing up and I guess this was way. Cheap and tasty.  I really had the taste for sushi the week leading up to the trip and I saw they actually had Unagi in their sushi section that I saw the \"chef\" making on the spot daily. However $8 for sushi from a grocery store just wasn't appealing. Maybe if it were a little cheaper.  They have a decent liquor and beer selection. Their prices weren't too bad, but nowhere near that of a larger liquor warehouse.  The store itself was clean, bright and pretty big. They also had some an Angry Birds claw game full of Angry Birds plushes.  I'd definitely shop here if I lived in the area and will likely be back next year when we come back to Lake Mead."}
{"text":"I dropped by here on the way to the Southern Nevada Health District to relax over a cup of Starbuck's coffee, and use their ATM machine. When I walked toward their Starbuck's, there in front of me was the store's biggest flaw. There were zero tables and stools for Starbuck's customers. The three tables from my past visit, were history. Drinking coffee standing up and walking is not an activity that I enjoy. I guess I could have sat at one of the chairs in the pharmacy waiting area. And so, I'd pass over their Starbuck's.    Minutes later, I was left to use the self checkout line on account of the fact that the only two human operated registers had long lines. Using a self checkout to buy a beer is not the end of the world, but if I had a cart of groceries, it would be irritating.    Despite these flaws, I rate the store design highly. The store is modern looking. The floor was clean and shiny. This store features charming embellishments that improve the shopping experience. Plus there is an aisle for foods of the world and for organic food.    The prices are on the high side. And that is why I only brought one item: a beer for later."}
{"text":"I stay nearby and shop here to avoid the walmart rush , however the customer service is worse then you could imagine. The managers are the only ones with respect and treat you like a real customer.My items have been tossed during check out,  words mumbled and huffing /puffing just to name a few things."}
{"text":"What the hell! Grabbed the water (24) cases from the display at the front of the store & checked out only to realize after I got to the car we picked up the wrong cases (32). The cashier had scanned the coupon but as I looked at my receipt I was charged $7.00. It was on sale for 2/$7.00 for 32 count. I went back to customer service and explained the situation. Got my refund but when I went to get the right cases, it was all gone! WTH!!!   I think it's misleading if the display for the water isn't the one that everyone would immediately grab.   Additionally there was a coupon for folgers coffee which we bought. The picture on the coupon showed the larger container and not the 22.6 oz container. This is false advertising!"}
{"text":"Very upset when I lived near Green Valley Pkwy. and that location closed its doors. Now I live near this Albie's and can shop here again. Needless to say, it's like comparing apples to rutabegas.  The store is not that clean, in my opinion. The layout is weird, but it may be just me trying to get used to it. Shopped here in the past, so it wasn't culture shock. Just not my favorite location in Summerlin on Flamingo and Hualapai and not the location I learned to tolerate on GVP and Sunset.  I may get used to this one eventually, but for now it doesn't speak to me. Would rather go out of the way to Winco or Smith's. I will keep trying to like you, but it's going to take some time. This is an in-a-pinch location that I will only visit on my way home from work from time to time, and to satisfy my craving for the Screaming Sicilian Pizza that I have only found here."}
{"text":"It meets your basic needs. I go to Costco for TP, Paper towels, tide, trash bags, steaks and chicken to freeze and other shockable items. However, my produce and daily fish I go here or Smith's. Lately, because it is closer, it has been here and it's been great.  In the meat department today the women my fiancé and I spoke to was so sweet and fun! I tasted two ahi tuni which she advised on the least spicy to the more spicy order. When we checked out the male cashier said putting the ahi on seaweed or squid salad mixed together.  Now I must try!!! I come here for basic needs and not to price compare. I will continue to go here for my produce."}
{"text":"High prices, horrible customer service, and I was literally almost run over with my 2 small children in tow. Then the man got out of his mint green Cadillac and began yelling and screaming at me and my two children, because we were \"in his way\" moving toward me like he was going to assault me. I left - quickly.   I've had nothing but problems with this store. I am constantly approached here for one thing or another. Money, booze, the use if my cell phone... And now apparently it has escalated into verbal confrontations.  Need more security. I won't be back."}
