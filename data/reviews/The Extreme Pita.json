{"text":"This location (130th) is owned by the nicest married couple.  They run this location wirh obvious pride and love.  Everything is fresh.  Place is spotless (including bathrooms which are immaculate!).  They are always fast and super friendly.  Highly recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"Horrible...had never tried Extreme Pita before and never will again.  Grill wasn't cleaned obviously before our two pitas were made as the first one made tasted more like shwarma than buffalo chicken.  Employee didn't even put the cheese on the buffalo chicken pita.  The Thai chicken pita was flavourless and soggy.  Lost two potential repeat customers tonight."}
{"text":"Ordered a small was given and charged for a regular. After complaining they charged me for a small, however they were unpleasant about it and never offered to remake it - really, I just wanted a small. Such a shame, the former owners had a real gem. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I go to Extreme Pita in Deerfoot Meadows all the time and I love it. With my positive experiences at the Deerfoot location I decided to try the one in Market Mall. What a mistake! First, the guy working was sitting on a chair near the register on his phone. I had to say hi three times before he looked up and reluctantly got up to help me. I ordered a buffalo chicken pita which is my favourite at the Deerfoot Meadows location and as soon as he started making it I should have run. He only put one small scoop of chicken on the grill for a regular sized pita and maybe a tablespoon of onion and a little cheese on top. No mushrooms, then in the bowl he dumped a tonne of lettuce and a tiny bit of tomato and the sauce. The chicken was barely cooked, in fact the cheese wasn't even melted and he was putting it in the bowl. Then the best part, he didn't mix it like I have always seen at he other location. He tossed it for a few seconds in a bag and then put the whole thing in the pita. I don't know why I paid after seeing , I guess it's just my politeness. What I ended up getting was a dry lettuce pita with a few token pieces of chicken and barely any sauce. It was bland and I threw most of it away. I will definitely be back to the Deerfoot location but never again at his one. What a waste"}
{"text":"I'm a pita and wrap girl. No ifs, ands or buts about it. That said, you can imagine how happy it makes me when I wander into a food court and see signage for The Extreme Pita. Two words (sounds?): WHOOP WHOOP.   I love how fresh all their ingredients are, and I love how friendly the people workin the pita bar are. The Extreme Pita is a delightful experience from beginning to end.   The only thing I wish is that they served an egg salad pita. Why do hardly any places in town serve egg salad a la wrap/pita? I promise if y'all put it on your menu, I'll eat it like it's going out of style. In fact, I Pinky Swear."}
{"text":"NOT vegetarian friendly. I was helping at a friend spa and went to get pita's for the girls.... i had to ask twice for the girls to change their gloves for the vegetarian pita and they not only rolled their eyes but asked \"why, it's cooked meat\" .... then tried to continue making the pita without offering a new one, so again i had to ask for a whole new pita. I am not vegetarian, but i am sensitive to it for others, as perhaps they should be too. Extreme Gross."}
{"text":"Man I was famished yesterday after work and wanted a quick meal but I didn't realize I was going to eat one of the most amazing take out foods EVER.  I love Extreme Pita; I love the freshness of the vegetables and their very diverse pita selections.  This place was on my way to the highway heading back to my home so I knew it would be a sure thing but I didn't expect this.  Can you imagine, fresh medium rare steak cooked with portabella mushrooms with a spicy sweet chipotle sauce at under $6.  I haven't even eaten this good at some 4 star restaurants.  Every bite was huge and so flavourful if I wasn't on my way to a supper I would have ordered another one.  Man try it you'll like it, their special is if you order this, you can have a soup on the side for just 1 buck. It doesn't get better than this; I am more than just a fan."}
{"text":"Barf!!! They should rebrand as Extremely bad Pita! After consuming I became depressed for 3 days.  Don't eat here, for the love of God!"}
{"text":"Have a pita on national pita day June 5th.  A healthy fast food option! They are also partnering with the Heart & Stroke Foundation.  A good location.  The staff is friendly and smiling.  The manager seems eager to help and friendly as well."}
{"text":"Super healthy options! Pretty much every kind of veggie you could want in a pita. However, cleanliness is a HUGE issue. They wear their aprons into the Starbucks next door! Not to mention they don't clean their grill between customers (like they advertise they do) and if you have a major allergy, avoid! They rarely change gloves or wipe down counters."}
