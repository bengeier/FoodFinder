{"text":"The food was fantastic for the whole family. Kids eat free on Sunday. The staff was really friendly. The guacamole is made table side which is awesome!!"}
{"text":"My family and I are passing through town and wanted Mexican food. This place was the closest to our hotel... and I must say, this is the best Mexican restaurant we've ever been to. The food, service and atmosphere are simply excellent."}
{"text":"Every time we order they mess our order up and this location is not near as good as the Amherst one but that one has gone downhill as well.The last time we are here the server was having a bad day and took it out on the customers which isn't acceptable.Never going back"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place!  Hands down the best Mexican food I have ever eaten.  The wait staff was funny & engaging... In a Ed Debevic style.  They joked and kidded around with us.  Several Mexican beers on tap.  I had a tall mug of Pacifico for $4.  The menu has just about every dish you could ask for.  I went for the fajitas-a mix of chicken, steak, chorizo, pork & shrimp with onions, peppers, etc.  The hubs had skirt streak.  Plenty of food at very decent prices.  My husband is Mexican so they brought us some spicier salsa and a green tomatillo sauce (without us asking).  Both really delicious.  They had a very extensive tequila list as well.  As an after dinner drink, we had shots of 1942 Don Julio.   Mmmmmmmm!  The $12 per shot is worth it!  The only bad thing is that we are just passing through on our way home for vacation, so I can't say as to when I will be back.  BUT, if I ever find myself within a 30 mile radius of this place you can bet my butt will be in a seat."}
{"text":"Ordered a quesadilla after work one day to go. It was soggy by the time I got it home but it was still pretty good. A little different than I was expecting though. No jalapeños or a lot of onions. Overall I'd look forward to eating here again, but with a few improvements the food could be above and beyond. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"¡Aye aye aye! Being a transplant from San Diego and dying for Mexican food, this is the best place for the real deal, and everyone there is super nice! This is now a regular place for us. Anyone looking for good food and an excellent atmosphere needs to stop here! And try their top shelf margaritas. ¡Fantastico! ¡Muy bueno y muchas gracias!"}
{"text":"Stopped for drinks and snacks. Tequila dip and bean dip and guac were great....and cheap. Medium mango margarita was too much to finish and only $8. Friend got this dish served in a half fresh pineapple. Wow..huge and good. She took more than half home.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We decided to give them another try. So upon our arrival my wife was about to pull open the door when a waiter comes busting out the door to talk to someone almost knocking my wife down. He did apologize. We were promptly seated and the chips came in about a minute. It was 9 pm on Saturday and only 4 tables were occupied. Our waiter took our drink orders shortly thereafter. I ordered a water which had a bug in it under the ice! Our food came out 15 minutes after ordering. Again I ordered chicken fajitas. Came out sizzling but the green peppers were severely undercooked. I realized I had no silverware when I went to start eating. By now I think we had 3 or 4 different waiters come to the table. One male server kept addressing my wife as \"honey\". It still seems that this establishment lacks mature management with all the horsing around going on with the employees. It seems like this place is run more like a bar instead of a restaurant. After getting my check I went up to pay. I handed him my bill for $24. He looked at me and told me it would be $94. I understand he was joking, but at this point I was not amused!"}
{"text":"Haven't reviewed this place in a while. It seems personal taste plays a big part with a lot of Mexican restaurants. This place is still one of my favorites in the area, though it can depend on what you order. I love their chips and salsa and appreciate that they give you your own dipping bowl to poor the salsa into. I like their frozen margaritas as lot. The tacos and tostadas are very good. I love the chipotle burrito. I didn't care for the enchiladas or tomales. The waitstaff is polite but quiet and that's the way I like it."}
{"text":"Try the tres locos if you can't decide what to get. A well flavored meal consisting of a bed of rice covered with a chicken breast, ribeye and shrimp finished with the perfect amount queso. Friendly bar and wait staff are here to greet you."}
{"text":"Better than average Mexican food. Nowadays you can find Mexican pretty much around every corner. In my opinion, Mexican food is like Chinese in the fact that it is pretty much universal wherever you go.  The decor is pretty cool and they have EXTREMELY quick and friendly service. I noticed they had some good drink specials as well. It's hard to write an in depth review for your typical Mexican."}
{"text":"The Margarita I purchased tasted like someone Crack a Tylenol and added it to the mixture. It was gross. I think it was because it sat in a plastic container behind the bar for a while. I do NOT recommend this place. The wait staff are not personable at all. There are many Mexican restaurants around...choose another!"}
{"text":"This Don Tequila trumps the other location in Amherst! The chimichangas were crunchy on the outside, and juicy on the inside. Great food, great service, good prices. All of the food was delivered piping hot and very fast. Many choices to choose from!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today for lunch and everything was amazing! Huge portions of delicious fresh food. The pico was the best I've ever had! The staff was fast and friendly as well."}
{"text":"Tony is always awesome. The staff is friendly and gives great service. Food comes out hot and fast! Favorite Mexican and the best around!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped on our way home to get takeout.  We got everything that we would get if we ate at the restaurant.  Everything was freshly made, and all food was excellent.  I like their food because it has a little extra kick in their sauces."}
{"text":"Terrible food. The worst mexican food restaurant I have ever been to. I couldn't even eat it. I ordered a fajita burrito and spit it out. I wish I could give it 0 stars because it ain't worth one. I even ordered sopapillas and they were more like chips with sugar on top. Very disappointed with the quality of the food. But this is Ohio. And the waiter didn't know what chile con queso was. Smdh"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, but the service not so good.  My husband and I both had fajitas and the portion sizes were very large.  We could have had one order between the 2 of us and still had enough to take home.   My oldest daughter had the pollo don tequila and said it was the best chicken she has ever had.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Sometimes hot sometimes cold. Table side guacamole is good depending on who makes it. Tell the to hold the salt and salt it yourself. The fajitas are very good. They put broccoli in it. YUM!  The tacos al pastor are great. The salsa is very good. We will go back."}
{"text":"First trip here after being a regular at the University Heights location.  Food was solid (queso fundido was the only disappointment - had a weird taste), and service was friendly and efficient.  Not a bad spot for some casual Mexican food."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time. Great intimate atmosphere, delicious, authentic Mexican cuisine, and very reasonable prices. The staff were all very friendly! We will definitely be back very soon. Luis was our server and he was fantastic. Also, the margaritas were very good. I have been a bartender in the restaurant industry for years, and a huge fan of Mexican food. This is DEFINITELY my new favorite place! Thank you Don Tequila!"}
{"text":"Good food, sister restaurant of El Patron; however no happy hour = no fun.  Number 29 is the bomb - great fried ice cream"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant in the Elyria area, this is your place! They have quite a selection to choose from and there is a several combinations in the back of the menu which gives you a generous portion of food.  They also have 1.99 Margaritas on Monday and boy they are not shy with the tequila! If you make a change on your order there are no substituting and you will get charged extra. Their chips and salsa is very plain Jane too like any other Mexican restaurant you go to.  I've noticed that they have some new servers now and my rating is due to the overall service and food.  The service was terrible.  This guy never even introduced me his name nor anyone in my group so there was no greeting it was just straight to what do you want to drink? And have you decided on what you wanted to eat? I was asking him a question about the chicken and cheese quesadilla and how big is it? And he responded that's it's just chicken and cheese and it was one size.  I got confused and asked him what's the difference with the app portion and the dinner portion and he didn't know nor did he care to provide me with an answer.  Basically I would only recommend people to come here to drink and not ask questions. That is all."}
{"text":"The food is good/fair but the service was poor. Anything we needed we had to go ask at the host stand."}
{"text":"Average service, bland food. Fish tacos were a mess--little fish, lots of tortilla. Margaritas not very strong, weak flavors. The decor is sub-par and looking worn."}
{"text":"we didnt even get seated, we got pointed to a table. We sat down and someone gave us our chips. We waited for 20 minutes before getting a waiter over to take our drink order. They didnt even give us a menu till after we got our drinks 25 minutes later. They never said sorry either. Good food though."}
{"text":"I'm here visiting and we walked in and was seated immediately at a booth. The decor seems fine and place looked clean. Our main issue was our waiter. He seemed as if he was either new or was having a negative day. He came off short and a little pushy. He didn't introduce himself to us and had this attitude about him. The food was above average.   I ordered the fish tacos and a margarita on the rocks with sugar. The large was $12.00 I believe which is a bit high in my opinion. I can get a margarita a little smaller in Philadelphia for half the price and it tastes the same. The three fish tacos were $9.99. Our bill was about $84.00.  We only left a $5.00 tip because he was a very bad waiter and we had to ask another waiter for our check. He was busy playing around at the bar with other employees. I'm usually always a great tipper but I can't tip good if the service wasn't good. It would be doing him a disservice. My friends food was good as that's what they said. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican restaurant. Get the fajita burrito or Durango burrito and you won't be disappointed. Staff is super nice and fast. Fun to relax out in the patio when it's nice out drinking a frozen margarita."}
