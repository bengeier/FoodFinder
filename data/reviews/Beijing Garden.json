{"text":"This place was awful! Wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy , ordered the orange chicken cause I'm thinking ( even the mall Chinese food can do it right) but no not Beijing Garden. The center of the chicken was hard to cut through like a rock and it had no flavor to it. Nothing was good about the food not even presentable. Will never go back."}
{"text":"This is the best authentic Chinese food around. Always fresh. Always delicious. My entire family loves this place because they always get our meals right and there's something for everyone. The chicken is real white meat chicken. Which is why this is the best General Tso's in town. And don't get me started on their Spring Rolls. We get disappointed any time we eat Chinese food from somewhere else. Beijing Garden is the measuring stick. Hands down."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Chinese Take Out for the last 7 years, so this is a cumulative review.  This is the best Chinese Take Out I've ever had.  Are they serving innovative and new Chinese cuisine.  No.  But when it comes to classic Chinese take-out, they're the best I've had.  They have the same menu items as everyone else, but their food is just better.  I love their beef dishes (Mongolian and Hunan are my favorites).  The beef they use is better quality than the competition.  The Crab Rangoon is also excellent.  The people that work there (which I assume is the family that owns it) are always very pleasant and accommodating.  I hope to order from there for another 7 years."}
{"text":"Very low quality food.  I'm pretty sure everything came out of a freezer.  They advertise healthy and fresh food, couldn't be further from the truth.  Just GARBAGE"}
{"text":"Just remodeled, the inside is very nice and clean. I got the general Tao chicken with crab Rangoon and it was very good. I'm usually not a fan of Chinese take out, but this place changes that. I will definitely be back! Also make sure to get the crab Rangoon!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious and hot an fresh , have been getting take out for years. The  woman cashier is always friendly and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Ordered general t'so chicken & fried rice. Rice look like white rice with fried rice fixing. It wasn't good. It had big pieces of undercooked onions in it. The chick were huge chunks. I've ordered this dish from plent other places, nerver chicken this large."}
{"text":"This is a popular lunch spot with my coworkers.  I had the broccoli with garlic sauce lunch special (includes choice of white, brown, or fried rice and egg roll, spring roll, or crab rangoon), which was a ton of food for $5.50.  It could have easily been 2 lunches.  I did not care for my selection.  The sauce was goopy and sweet, and there was way too much of it.  Plus it was really a mixture of vegetables (with a lot of large pieces of onions), not just broccoli like I assumed from the name.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I would  go back and just order more carefully."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese take out I have had, period.   Being totally forthcoming we typically don't \"take out\", they have a few booths so we usually eat in the restaurant.   The place gets crazy busy, the phone constantly rings with incoming orders and the door is constantly opening and closing with people coming and going.  Don't expect fancy, we sit there and the TV is blaring with Sponge Bob Square Pants for the owners kids. and the dining room is nothing special at all (seriously, there isn't even a restroom that I can see).   That really isn't the reason you are there, you are there for the food.  I typically get the Broccoli in Garlic Sauce and the Vegetable Fried rice.   My wife gets the Lo Mein (you can see from the pics I took how good the food looks).   I can say that their Vegetable Fried rice is easily the best I have ever had.   It is TOTALLY not that heavy, greasy crap you get at most Chinese restaurants.   It tastes very fresh and I could literally just eat a few plates of that and they would still get the 5 stars from me.  Overall, this has become one of our go-to places, nothing fancy but some seriously damn fine Chinese food.   Give them a whirl I think you will be happy with what you get."}
{"text":"Lunch or dinner, I love the good food and atmosphere. Staff is polite, place is clean and orderly. Prices are great for lunch, and normal dinner prices. I usually only get sesame chicken, general tsos, and wonton soup. They had huge chunks of chicken and barely any breading. The Kung pao chicken was divine as well."}
{"text":"I rarely do Chinese take out because, honestly, I just get disappointed. Therefore, I admit, I don't have many comparisons in mind, but what I do know is that I've been extremely satisfied by the service and care. The wait is always fast, even though it's constantly busy with the phones ringing off the hook. The Chinese hostess goes out of her way to remember your favorite dishes and makes conversation with you when she can.  I especially love the hot and sour soup here - lots of ingredients and this place supplies the ramen noodle chips as a topper when you carry out. I remember watching people run in and out of this place while running at the fitness center next door, so I know this place is popular!"}
{"text":"Food is extra yummy...we got orange chicken..they use all white meat which is a plus for me because I always have to ask and pay extra but they just use it as a normal meat the service was super friendly she gave my daughter's a sucker right when they walked in the door that made them smile I would definitely recommend this place and it was priced very reasonably"}
{"text":"Apple is the most inviting host that there is in the world and she has the most amazing sesame chicken"}
{"text":"Great takeout spot just up the street between Twinsburgh and Hudson.  Not many tables, but we managed to find them not busy one rainy Saturday.  Lunch menu is mix and match with a wide range of oriental options including Pad Thai, Udon Noodles, and Ho Fun.    Steamed chicken dumplings were not too salty with plenty of ginger.  The Pad Thai was nicely seasoned... except for a mystery hot pepper powder that looked like paprika... but there was more than enough to eat after carefully moving the red coated noodles to the side. Crab rangoon were a nice balance of crab and cream cheese... as others noted... a nice house made option!  Chicken and broccoli could be ordered without breading and was very moist with crisp flourettes.  We grab take out on the way home every couple of weeks and it is often packed."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The food was pretty tasteless and the texture made it seem like it had been cooking all day (and not in a good way). I'm going to keep looking for good take out!!"}
{"text":"Very good food. I love the crab rangoon and sesame chicken dinner. The lunch special is the best and really cheap. You get a lot of food.  Customer service is always good.  The only issue I have is the phone.  Sometimes the phone is off the hook or busy to call in orders."}
{"text":"Best N.Y. style Chinese restaurant in the area. Ordered the General Tso's Chicken lunch special. I like that they allow you to choose an egg roll or Crab Rangoon as an appetizer. It was easy to order, it was ready on time and the food was amazing. If you're craving some good NY style Chinese and you're in the area, you cannot pick a better spot to go!"}
{"text":"I have tried this establishment several times for lunch and the food is always good and hot when you get it.  The service is always excellent.  It is not really made for dining in although they do have a few tables. Excellent take out."}
{"text":"Best chicken Lo Mein !!! I love their food  Everything I tried on the menu was delicious"}
{"text":"They've done a great job of fixing up the place.  This includes much better quality food than the previous owner and the decor is very nice as well.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I got orange chicken and did not like it at all. I was expecting an orange glaze type sauce. Not a soy and slight orange taste. It was vey salty and I did not care for the dark meat. If I would get it again I would possibly ask for white meat. I end up putting sweet and sour sauce on it to try to make it more palatable. That didn't work. I tossed it."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Fast food Chinese that looks like a restaurant. Don't bother ordering there!"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese, but do not order Pad Thai.  It was almost inedible.  Eggplant Chicken in Garlic Sauce is one of the best items on their menu."}
