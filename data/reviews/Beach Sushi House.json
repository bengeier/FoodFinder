{"text":"I eat here lots.  And it's probably because I'm from Vancouver and NEED SUSHI.  The sushi is good quality for Toronto... it's not great, but it's really good."}
{"text":"Great place! Although it is now called Sam's Sumo Sushi. I've been there 5 times. Great for the price and the people are friendly. Yumei sushi is a little better but a lot pricier for what you get."}
{"text":"AHA! Yup. Found another one! Found another good sushi restaurant!

SCORE!

This place used to be called Beach Sushi. Now under new management, it has been re-branded as \"Sumo Sushi\". People are often apprehensive when trying a past fave restaurant under new management, but not me! I'm always on the hunt to find fresh sushi.

... And fresh sushi DID I find! :)

From the moment the 1st spicy salmon roll piece touched my lips, I knew I found love... soooo fresh was the salmon... it melted in my mouth... as smooth as butter... mmm... mmm... MMMMM...

I've already spread the word to multiple friends and they all have future dates to dine at Sumo.

Fyi, the owners are Korean. And if you happen to dine here with a full speaking Korean friend, the owners will make special tasters and sushi on the house.

Good food. Good owners. Means repeat visits!"}
{"text":"Sushi can sometimes always be sushi - Ill have a California Roll, a Spicy Tuna Roll, 2 pieces of Salmon Sashimi, and Gyoza to start off. Green Tea, and maybe a Sapporo. 
That is my staple Sushi dinner selection 9/10 times. Until Beach Sushi house came along. Beaches Roll, Dragon Roll, and I will always keep the Spicy Tuna Roll in the mix. Plus 2 bottles of Sapporo. The Beaches roll consists of fresh crab, cucumber, fish eggs (my kids call it candy, well that's what I told them it was!), mixed with spicy may, wrapped delicately with seaweed, and layered with fresh avocado. Wow, that is one great looking roll, and spicy too. Secondly we have the Dragon Roll - Deep fried shrimp, cucumber, fresh avocado, spicy mayo, and we wouldn't forget the \"candy\", wrapped in seaweed, layered with fresh Salmon. Amazing! Then lets finish it off with a fresh spicy tuna roll, and wash it down with a ice cold Sapporo. 
I personally do not like to fill myself to exhaustion, and this meal does the trick! Satisfied customer, amazing wait staff, and I enjoy the fresh orange slices after the meal. 
A beaches gem! An average check price for Sushi. Well worth it though. 
The restaurant is on the smaller size, hard to access with a stroller or wheelchair. The largest table I believe that it could accommodate would be 6."}
{"text":"August 6, 2010 Edit:

The restaurant is now registered with DineSafe, as of Aug 3rd.  

I haven't been there yet, so the rating change to 4 stars is just to cancel out my initial 1 star rating due to the problems listed below.  In a few weeks if I haven't eaten at the restaurant and can't provide a proper review, I'll remove my entry entirely.  I'm not removing it immediately because I should give people who had read the original review a chance to see that they are now registered with DineSafe.

Original Review:

It should be noted that this restaurant is not registered with DineSafe.

I can't say I've eaten here, so this review is based 100% on the fact that the restaurant appears to be operating illegally. 

This might seem a little unfair, but considering that Sushi places are considered high risk and under the bylaw need to be inspected 3 times a year, -This- is an accident waiting to happen. 

This review will be readjusted or removed once they comply with the law.

\"As of January 2001, Toronto's Municipal Code 545-Licensing requires eating and drinking establishments (i.e. every place where food items intended for human consumption are made for sale, offered for sale, stored or sold), to do the following:\"

-Post the food safety inspection notice in an obvious place clearly visible to members of the public, at or near the entrance of the establishment;

-Post the Toronto eating or drinking establishment licence next to the food safety inspection notice;

-Produce copies of the Toronto Public Health Food Safety Inspection Reports relating to the currently posted disclosure notice for your establishment, when requested by any person;

-Notify the Toronto Municipal Licensing and Standards Division if there is a change in the management or control of the establishment; and

-Notify the Toronto Municipal Licensing and Standards Division of any change or changes to the operation of the business that may result in \"risk classification changes\", at least 30 days prior to the change."}
