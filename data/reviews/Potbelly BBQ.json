{"text":"Thee best barb-q ever!!! The beef brisket was amazing and not smothered in sauce or vinegar concoction. Heard the pull pork was delectable. Very, very clean and reasonably priced. The food was so good, they ran out. Wish they had a brick and mortar so I could enjoy more often."}
{"text":"Found them outside of Triple C Brewing tonight. To start, the food truck has a 100% sanitation grade. My wife and I both had the pulled pork sandwiches. The sweet BBQ sauce and tender meet was delicious. I had potato salad and baked beans with my sandwich. Both were spot-on. If you run across this food truck, don't pass it up."}

{"text":"The food is outstanding ! All freshly smoked and sides are made every day. The food has the best flavor and perfect balance of smoke and dry rub mix. The BBQ pulled pork sandwich with a touch of Sweet Baby Rays is just enough to make you want more. Add a side of smoked Mac and cheese and you won't ever eat BBQ anywhere els!"}
{"text":"I found this food truck at President James K Polk's Historic Site. They weren't scheduled to be here today. However, another BBq food truck was supposed to be here for the festival. But, that food truck called and cancelled today at 10:30am. So, this food truck got the call and they gladly showed up within a half hour. I'm glad they did too. 

I wanted their BBq pulled pork sandwich but they were out of them. So, I chose their BBq chicken sandwich which is fixed just like their BBq sandwiches. And that includes slaw and BBq sauce added on a hamburger bun. I was pleasantly surprised that this sandwich was delicious. The BBq chicken was tender and the homemade slaw created a delectable sandwich especially with the BBq sauce added to it. I liked their BBq sauce too.

Service was fast and friendly. As you can tell, the food truck guy was talkative. That's how I found out all this information. I'm glad they showed up for this festival. I didn't even know food trucks were going to be here. Anyway, Potbelly BBq is out of Charlotte, North Carolina."}
