{"text":"I stop in here for lunch 2 or 3 times a month. Food is decent bar food. Service is decent. Nothing to amazing. No reason not to go when I'm in the area. Have never been here for the bar scene later in the day and evening. Pretty big place and an outdoor bar. Lots of TVs. Probably a pretty good sports bar."}
{"text":"Happy hour on Monday....  We sat outside and waited about 10-15 minutes for ANY server to come acknowledge us.   Server was ok , happy hour specials were decent.  and I like the couches they had outside with the misters.  I would come back again.. I hope the owners get better servers or this bar will not  be in business."}
{"text":"They have a get patio !!  Great wraps and Caesar salads ... Big portions :)   The wings are pretty good too!  Your food come out fairly fast.  My only complaint was the waitress we had was kinda snotty and really didn't seem to know what she was doing my drinks remained empty for most of the time I was there ... They weren't even busy I could see if you were really really busy running your ass off ... I gave them a 3 star because I feel like your waitresses are the personality of the business no one is going to want to go back if you get treated like your not worth the time. So I hope you don't have that problem! Over all the food is good and drinks are great"}
{"text":"Wow, good music, great weather, good drinks! Service was great! Good started off slow but Jr made good on everything! Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"If you like getting insulted by the bartenders for your beverage choices, then you could give this place 2 stars.  I switch to pop or water if I know I'm going to be leaving soon and need to lose the buzz, and you would think bartenders would be a little understanding of people not wanting to drink and drive.  Of course, the male bartenders wear shirts that say \"Party like a pinata - get smashed\" and the female workers hardly wear anything at all.  If you have a low IQ and/or high testosterone levels, then this is probably a good choice for you.  I will never return."}
{"text":"Horrible service with bad security. Never coming here to play pool and drink again. The bar wenches were more worried about dancing by the dj booth instead of assisting customers. Bad chicken and fries as well. Definitely not coming here again."}
{"text":"Always go here to watch the fights on their amazing plasma TV screens all over the place! They probably have 50,000 dollars worth of TVs inside! Patio scene is awesome, very open inside, and a great selection of beer!!"}
{"text":"The wife a I and a friend of ours visited here on this past Sunday for the first time.  We sat outside at a table that we realized was dirty once we sat down. We asked the waitress to clean it , she attempted to but still dirty. She looked about 15 yrs old tattoos all over, real short shorts and her shirt pulled up in the front and tied , exposing her stomach. Not to appealing in the food business,  Nothing against tattoos, I have a few myself.  Then we find out she wasn't actually our waitress it was another young girl that had no clue what was going on that was our waitress. She wasn't familiar with the menu and had no idea what I was asking about, when I asked what type of root beer they carry.  We had enough and had the bar manager named Krissy help us. Krissy was amazing, full of compassion and very professional. She was very thorough and explained everything and answered all questions. After finally ordering, Krissy checked on us and kept the drinks filled up. The food was delicious and Krissy was awesome!! A little helpful note for the young ditzy waitresses, a lot more training!!!! Also dress a little more descent. I understand it is a sports bar but that doesnt mean strip club.   I would give Krissy a 5star and the ditzy's a 0. That's why 3 stars. If you go here ask for Krissy or someone just as professional with excellent customer service skills that are similar.   Kudos Krissy!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service. The GM ensured we had everything we needed and enjoyed the flatbread. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I come from California to Arizona on business nd it's hard to find a good sports bar with an awesome environment... The GM Nate came to talk to us positive attitude good service. Thank u Mad Dogs..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I will have to say the one big positive is that Mad Dog's is A LOT better than the Salty Senorita's that used to be there. Great makeover and glad they added an additional bar on the patio. Definitely a great spot to watch a sports event as there are a ton of tv's. There isn't a bad seat in the house.   On the other hand, the staff is an entirely different story. Best way to get the fastest service is to sit at the inside bar. We sat at the outside one on our first first and waited almost 20 minutes before we got our drinks. I think their prices for HH are decent. HH food isn't too bad either.   As for the \"douche bag\" effect  some other people have commented on, I would absolutely have to agree. Definitely a weird mixture of bikers and some type of new breed of West Coast Juice Head Gorilla's.... just tell 'em to GTL... but if fist pumping starts taking place, I'll never return LOL"}
{"text":"This place was just alright.  since it use to be salty senoritas, it already had the appeal.   The drinks are expensive and since I'm not a 12 year old, I can drink a lot.   The last time i went there, My wife and I met a cool couple and for some reason hung out with them all night getting hammered.   Now, since this place is littered with total D-bags, the appeal has gone down a fresh bemis toilet. Its like those \"i tell people I'm a cage fighter but honestly I can barely put my own clothes on by myself\" have radars in their bandanas and can spot a new bar when it opens.   I think Ill just stick to buying 30 packs and sleeping under my stair case every friday and saturday night wasted with my pants around my ankles. WAYYYY more fun."}
{"text":"I had so much good time in this place those last couple years and today I had a bad experience!  Service was cheap and our waitress didn't know the list of beers, she had to come back two times at the table because we ordered something she said they have it and few minutes later she came back to say that they don't have it. The menu that she gave us were dirty and sticky."}
{"text":"Mad dogs is an over all great experience, great people, and good bar food. Definitely worth a shot or two!"}
{"text":"First time, Last time. Bartender so slow!!! Waitresses waiting for drinks looking back @ us nervously. The bartender doesn't care. Want to chat with girls. Had to take my bill up to bar to leave. They cash me out?  No. Yelled for my waitress. While I'm standing waiting longer."}
{"text":"Hard one star. Wish I could give zero! The place is a mess servers are nice, but you can tell it's managed by a drunk toddler. There's no consistency in any area whether it's atmosphere, service, food, drinks, etc. Bartenders don't know how to poor a drink properly(which works out for the patrons because they over pour a shit ton) I can tell there's no chef. The food is uninaginative, boring, poorly seasoned, never cooked properly, and tasteless.  They have the dumbest theme nights ever which draws the worst type of crowds which in turn hurts the servers.  They don't have a hostess which is an absolute joke considering they have too many tables. I go in there some servers have full sections, others are empty, etc. That's not how a place that size works.   It's disgusting to me how poorly managed it is and it's an embarassment to whoever calls themself the general manager. Honestly the worst run place I've ever visited. I cannot stress that enough. The owners are getting fucked because they trust their restaurant in the hands of what seems to be a drunk toddler who has never been to, worked in, or run a restaurant before.  Fucking embarrassing."}
{"text":"This place is boring and the waitresses are really stuck up and rude!  They deserve no tip."}
{"text":"Don't pass this place up! Great food, superb atmosphere and fantastic staff. Not to mention it's budget making it the ideal hang out spot.  You will find me there eating a good burger entree, while shifting my head back n forth across the plasma screens.   Appetizers are a great deal here so don't forget to try several."}
{"text":"I am so relieved to have a new local bar. I have been there quite a few times and I must say it's the new hot spot. They have shuffle board, pool tables, darts and a dance floor. The crowd is pretty good on a friday or saturday night (mostly people in their mid 20's-30's). The waitresses and bartenders are very friendly and attractive. This is an awesome place to go for UFC. No cover, tons of TVs, cheap beer and the food isn't bad either. I got the pork bones and I'd definitely recommend them. You'll probably run into me when you go."}
{"text":"It's place of choice for happy hour. Always crowded, it's fun to people watch. Everything non-beef is great. I'm a fan of their wings and cheese sticks. Great service despite the crowds. Only downside is the beef, so I don't recommend burgers, beef tacos ( though the pork are great), etc. happy hour boasts half off appetizers and discounted drinks. And lots and lots of TVs for sports fans."}
{"text":"Mad Dogs is a great place to watch football.  They have tons of TVs both  inside and on the patio.  The patio is really big and comfortable.  They always have good beer prices.  The food used to be good, then it was really bad, but now I have heard it is good again.  I will have to try it again someday."}
{"text":"My wife and I have visited here  for the past 3 Sundays for football. I love it, Plenty of tvs, Seats and attractive friendly staff. I have had no problems that the other reviewers have had. I have found my new spot. FYI... BEST Reuben I have ever had and they have curly fries too... Soooo good. How can you not like a place that has seasoned curly fries?  Overall Great place for any age over 21 haha... oooh and they sell Cigars and allow you to smoke them on the patio."}
{"text":"Don't tell customers over the phone the is no cover for ufc then charge 10 bucks at the door. Just be straight from the start. The 10 bucks is no big deal. The lying to customers then charging them is bs."}
{"text":"We've been here a few different times.....but this time was different.  We went on a Friday night just to have a few drinks and some food with friends.  We like the big outdoor patio, but this time around the misters were overkill making everything wet and the music was super loud on the patio even in the back so we are all having to talk really loud just to be heard.  Food came out wrong the first time, but it wasn't a special order they just couldn't make it like the menu said.....waitress seemed to have a hard time remembering to bring back drinks or condiments or silverware without us having to remind her several times.  We get our bills and 1 of them doesn't have the itemization so we ask for it and it takes FOREVER for her to bring it back then she apologizes saying it was originally $3 too high...okay.....then we notice that every soda that was ordered is $2 each...why aren't there free refills and why can't the waitress mention that seeing as that seems abnormal for any bar or restaurant?  And it seems well vodka drinks are $8....we're not in Scottsdale...that seemed excessive for a sports bar.  Overall left a bad impression and the friends we were with said they'll never go back."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. The food is decent too, great portion sizes. It's super trashy but if you want good drink and food specials this is your place.  One thing that really upsets me about this place, however, is the fact that they leave the TVs on day and night. I drive by every morning at 7 am and all the TVs are on. This is a huge waste of energy and I think they need to stop."}
{"text":"Food is great. Drinks are great. Nate (GM) made our party feel real welcome. Here for game 7 of NBA finals and the environment was perfect for the game. Also some live music outside which was real cool!"}
{"text":"I'm usually an easy to please eater. Almost everywhere I go, I'll get a burger. I got the sliders here and they left a lot to be desired. They were strictly meat, cheese and onions.... That's it. No mayo, no pickle no lettuce. Nothing. My husband got the pulled pork sliders and they were cold. I thought it might be the coleslaw, but they were cold throughout the whole thing.  Defiantly not what we expected. I don't know if we will be back unless we just plan to drink.  Our bartender was nice though =)"}
{"text":"A lot of bikers come here, the outdoor section is the bomb but the food isn't so great.  Its a very diverse crowd that come here, lots of security and cops on the weekends."}
{"text":"I love this place! I like happy hours but tonight is even better! Gets DJ mixing old and new school music! The food is always good!"}
{"text":"Great location, awesome outdoor patio with fireplace, really nice couches/furniture, good drinks, and friendly service. AWESOME music with a really friendly DJ who even took alot of extra trouble to find a song we requested so he could play it. The place was packed even on a Wednesday night - (Ladies night with $1 long islands!). They have a dance floor, although it wasn't used much. Although it's loud like a club inside with pool tables and lots of seating, outside is much quieter if you're looking for a place to have good conversation. Sometimes the servers are slow, but there are 2 bars, one inside and one outside and you can easily go up to the bar and order drinks. Met a lot of super friendly patrons there too, but I usually go with my own friends. Cool place to chill with friends and drink. Haven't tried their food menu, but the place always looks full when I drive by, so it must be good.  Mad Dog gets my 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Obviously this place knows they are the only place really to be around for Mesa... Also plenty of cops out front to remind u about the tents... So basically come here pay way more for lame service and be happy... Not friendly at all... Travel all over the country ... This place needs a lesson on hospitality... My hopes that one day somebody else with better customer service is able to slide past the Mesa thing and open a better bar... The five dollar uber ride to Gilbert would be worth ur time and evening ... I won't come back again .. This place is all hype in my humble opinion"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Woody is great Come check this place out. Live music Great happy hour  Fun wait staff"}
{"text":"This place has the smallest collection of happy hour drinks! The bartender (Ciara) was not the greatest but I know she tried her hardest. I didn't get to eat any food because their beer was cloudy and flat which made me think twice about ordering. There was a group of loud obnoxious people when I went and the bartender admitted that this was the norm for this bar. So I won't be returning. 2 stars for the cheapest happy hour draft beer in town."}
{"text":"Went last night for 2 for 1 burger night. Burgers were good (not great) and cooked perfectly. Can't beat the food or beer prices. DJ was a little loud which would have been ok if more people were dancing but most there were socializing. Service was friendly and punctual. Would definitely return, but maybe on a Weekend night."}
{"text":"Very poor service, at one point I had to go up to the bar to get my beer refilled and there was only maybe 10 people there. Food was passable but not great., bacon bits on burgers instead of slices. Won't be back.  Also seat backs were terrible,did anyone actually sit In one before they filled the place with them?"}
{"text":"Every time I have come here, it's been packed and this time I got here at opening.  It was no different.  Within 30 mins, the place was noisy with customers-midweek.  That says something about the food, the service, the prices, etc.  Started out with the boneless chicken wings as an appetizers.  There are a variety of sauces to choose from to suit everyone's tastes, from mild, tangy, to suicide hot.  The spinach dip was perfect.  Hot and cheesy.  The pizza burger is no longer on the menu and with a quick check with the kitchen, they made it for me....how cool is that!!!  I didn't even ask the waitress to ask...she volunteered.  SERIOUSLY!  It is THAT kind of customer service that keeps people coming back!  The burgers were huge and messy-get all over your face variety.  We ended up talking them home,lol.  Overall, a really nice lunch.  Service was great but I will say this, don't plan on coming here if your limited on your lunch hour.  If it's busy, your meal will come out as your leaving to head back to work.  That's OK. A quick stop at the gas station was the answer."}
{"text":"I Like it...Good bar on a FRIDAY night, If you like it a little ghetto..I don't care who is there and people don't bother me, I just enjoy the music, tilt a few back and smoke a cigar"}
{"text":"well not my kind of place, food was horrible , place itself wasn't bad really big inside and patio was large with plenty of seating. Patrons were very Ghetto i heard it was a biker bar but i didn't see any bikers i saw a lot of thugs and dbags, again not my kind of place"}
{"text":"Although the atomsphere was nice and quait, the wait time for a meal was long.  It took almost 40 minutes to get our food after we order it.   Also, I had the chicken quesadilla the chicken was so dry and overcooked I had to chew for ever to break it up.  I would not reccomend getting the grilled onions on it, makes it soggy"}
{"text":"I have been in to Mad Dog's twice and I am not imprressed.  My friend and I came on weekdays both times for lunch and the servers bordered on hostile. I came close to just walking out last time.  We were the only people in the place and were given looks like we were bothering them.  The burgers are decent, the beer selection is kind of, meh, but the service is horrible."}
{"text":"This place has a great patio but that is all it has going for it. Mediocre food, weak expensive drinks and TERRIBLE service. Don't waste your time. The servers are rude and you will wait half an hour before anyone even bothers to come by. What a waste of a good location."}
{"text":"again....2 stars because booze is sold here.....that's it. This is the definition of douche bag bar fight central. Oh and i forgot to mention bar none the worst service I have ever experienced. If you want to watch a couple of shitty drunk biker bros fight each other over which one has watched more UFC, get here now! If you want to enjoy your drinks and chill with friends, go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Love the new cocktail list and events they have been doing! So excited they are putting back into this place."}
{"text":"Ok on the patio at the bar I ordered a red wine which I know is served room temperature. I tried the wine twice. But double whammy wine was warm from the sun plus the glass was really warm/hot must of just came out of the dishwasher. I told the bartender the wine was really warm her response was its supposed to be room temp then walked away really fast unable to finish with the glass was warm as well. She then turn to me aloud about 6ft away from me and said so now what do you want me to do. I said a light beer. So about 15 min later I saw her take my wine out of the cooler poor it into another glass and serve to someone inside the bar. I could not believe it because I had already drank from the wine twice."}
{"text":"Self seating quick service, inside or outdoor seating. Plenty of TV's to watch sports on. Great prices and  selections on beer. The Mad Dog Bites are AWESOME! Pork ribs that fall off the bone! The garlic parm is my favorite. The service was fast and friendly. Plenty of room for the whole gang."}
{"text":"First things first; the service was terrible.   We had just finished a movie and wanted to continue the night with some food and drinks. My two other friends live in North Scottsdale so they were looking to me for ideas of places to go. I knew Mad Dog Saloon was new, and I had not been there yet., so thought it could be a good place to try out.  We walked in and sat on the patio. It wasn't very crowded or anything, but there were people there. It took the waitress 20 minutes to finally come over to us from talking up everyone else. When she came over she did not introduce herself, welcome us, or even make eye contact! She threw some food menus on the table and left....  We waited just a bit longer to see if she would come back....we waited about another 15 minutes...she never did. We never got to try the food, because we left."}
{"text":"I'm making sure to write this review the day after going so my annoyance has gone down a little. So I've been here twice. Once to eat in the middle of the day and then last night for drinks. Four of us got there around 9 pm so really not late or very crowded yet. We went straight to the bar to order some drinks and play shuffleboard. Getting a refill on said drink order turned out to be impossible. THREE bartenders for a really not busy bar (maybe 20 people) and I had all three either look directly at me (I know because we were the only ones on that side of the bar) and turn away OR walk towards our side of the bar and then completely turn around to go to another patron (we had that happen twice ... They literally walked over to our end of the bar, then turned around towards the other side of the bar where there was more people ... I guess their money is better than ours?). I was standing with hands on an empty pint glass looking at someone to help for the majority of the night. I had to interrupt one bartender flirting with two guys after about five minutes because her back wasn't turning around to look at her other customers. Apparently you better not be a girl and if you're a guy, take off your wedding rings, because unless you're flirting with them, they won't give you the time of day."}
{"text":"My husband and I pass this place every night on our way home from work. Today I had a terrible day at work so my husband suggested a much needed happy hour at Mad Dog. It was just what I needed. Our server, Brittany, was wonderful. Our appetizers were $2 off until 7 and the atmosphere was great! We'll absolutely be back for many more much needed terrible day at work happy hours and maybe to watch a game or two, lots of TV's in this place!!"}
{"text":"one star is being nice thats just for the free ufc fights!!!!  Had issues twice since ive been there.  When with my boyfriend to play pool and one of the bouncers told him that he couldnt wear his wave cap!  ok but they can have bikers in there with there jackets and bandanas!  Bullshit!!!!!  Gave the place another try last night stopped in because we heard on the radio that there was 1$ long islands my man orders and i go to pay when i get my money back he charges me 8$ for the drink and tells me that its only on weds nights i say fine then id like to order something cheaper he tells me to bad he already poured the drink and nothing wrong with it!!  Nate Williamson is his name was such a DICK and extremely unprofessional who runs there business like that he kept copping and attitude with me i was shocked!  I have been to dive bars that treated me better then that!  Ill never go back there sux!!"}
{"text":"Great service. .decent prices. .awesome patio.    But not for fight night..It's to fighty..lol"}
{"text":"Whent for appetizers and drinks it was pretty good had fun and food was great. Service was good I liked the green sauce the nachos came with. It's a must get. My favorite was the sliders. Happy hour is pretty good and i will recommend to anyone that wants to head out for happy hour"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get dinner.  Service is slow...servers not friendly.  As I was leaving during the shift change a new more competent  and friendly crew seemed to be coming in."}
{"text":"Custom service was horrible! Waitress spilled a pitcher all over the table, my phone,  and it splashed in my face. She did not come back to clean it up or even apologize.  I asked a security guard for a manager and when he came over he also failed to apologize and seemed more annoyed that he had to clean up the mess. The waitress did not come back to our table the rest of the night. In order for us to get drinks/food we had to go to the bar. Horrible customer service. This was my first time here and I will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to watch a football game. We started our Sunday at RT OK Sullivan but they refused to change one of the 8 tvs outside to the Steelers game. If they were not listed as a Steelers Bar I wouldn't have left right then. So we went next door and the staff at Mad Dog heard our story and immediately turned a TV to the game. We ended up staying through most of the afternoon and spent quite a bit on beer and food. Guess the other bar doesn't like money... We will be regulars at Mad Dog now. Here we go Steelers!!! Here we go!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite locals spots on a Monday night for beer pong and wings. Patio bartender is one of my new favorite peeps."}
{"text":"Service is good, girls are smiling & didn't have an attitude. Outdoor & indoor bar, plenty of patio seating. Food was pretty dang good. had the quesadilla & chicken wings and I enjoyed them. For a bar, this place isn't a bad place to waist some time"}
{"text":"Stopped in to see 2nd half of a football game and was VERY pleasantly surprised! Awesome space (it's HUGE!) and plenty of TVs everywhere. Service was super fast and friendly, and their menu looks great (looking forward to trying their food next time!).  Only downside was that a Smirnoff vodka was $8.50 (WHAT?!). For Smirnoff??  Seriously people, we're not in Manhattan, we're in Mesa. Let's price the drinks appropriately.  Otherwise 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Family owned bar and restaurant  amidst all the chain places up and down Stapley definitely a must try! Great menu with different specials going on all the time. Wether it's grabbing a quick bite for lunch, watching a UFC fight, or staying out late with friends. Mad Dogs is tailored to every type of person. Make sure to stop on in next time you are in Mesa."}
{"text":"The place is nice, big patio and very large warehouse-like inside with a huge bar and lot of high-tops. The feel is sports bar, very casual.  The problem is the food is rubbery and borderline awful, tastes like plastic. Everything was frozen or canned prior to serving and it's very obvious.   If you are looking for good drinks, Mad Dog isn't a bad option, but the Chicken Fingers and Trailer Nachos were very disappointing, especially the trailer nachos."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! The waitress just stare at you and don't help you they walk past you and don't care"}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend from LA and my boyfriend recommended this place (he hadn't been since it was Salty Senorita).. From the very beginning it was terrible. Service was non existant I had to flag down a server who walked right past us. And the food? OMG yuck. The burger was so over cooked and flavorless we sent it back after one bite. Only plus I can give is that the drinks were cheap.."}
{"text":"Apparently the manger is absent or needs customer service training .  The Patio bartender was more interested in socializing than service. After watching 3 waitress' hang out at the bar and ignore customers my husband decided to go to the bar and order for us. Our waitress did not show up until my husband brought our drinks back to our table.Food was good/average for bar food but the service will keep us away.  Maybe this is why Phoenix was rated as 7th in poor (rude) customer service as reported by Channel 15. I think they can and should do better, especially on a non-crowded  Monday night."}
{"text":"Service at the bar sucks! Bartender played on a customer's phone for 15 min while I waited for another beer. Wake up!"}
{"text":"This bar is crappy the drinks are watered  down the food is disgusting  and management  does not care about  customer service.  I will never be back. Happy they are going  out of business"}
{"text":"Went last night with a friend had drinks (warm draft) and ate wings and artichoke dip both were not even worth eating! Dip was cold cheese was hard and the wings, some were burnt and the ranch was literally water.... Don't go here for the food... Patio was nice misters work great so there's the one star...."}
{"text":"Great patio, good spinach dip and drinks. That was until we got the bill. $8.50 for a Smirnoff and soda? Same for a Captain and coke? We were in Gilbert, not Scottsdale. What the..."}
{"text":"Very packed, drinks took awhile to come so order another round when about halfway through your drink. Food was alright. Our waitress was nice. Bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"We were here for happy hour last night - and while the prices were agreeable, the food left a lot to be desired.  We sat inside as it's Shark Week & there was a pre-season football game on.  The service was so-so - the chicken tenders were fried in the same oil as their fish - which is never a good thing & the sliders tasted kinda elementary schooly.  And then, the cardinal sin when it comes to nachos... SOGGY CHIPS!  And they were totally soggy - so much so that we didn't even put a dent in them.  So - take it with a grain of salt, we didn't order any \"real\" food, but were not impressed at all with anything other than their happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Nice looking establishment,  but it took an hour and a half to get our food.   Plus their was a lot of confusion when they brought the food out and gave it to the wrong person.   We won't be back!"}
{"text":"$1 tacos on Tuesday nights (not sure what time that starts).  The bartender talked them up, and they were actually pretty good.  My friend and I stopped in here for a beer before catching a movie across the street at the AMC 24.  (Why can't they serve alcohol in movie theaters? That would be awesome.)  Several beers on tap, nothing too exciting, but nice for my regular Guinness pull.  I'll come back and hang out longer next time, as there was plenty of outdoor seating with the spray coolers overhead."}
{"text":"Great place!~  We had a birthday party here last ngiht and the staff was wonderful.  I'm so happy to see a nice place like this in Mesa.  The food was really good to.  Thank you Danell for all your help!  Great for a group event."}
{"text":"I came here to watch a Cardinals game and for Happy Hour, which is from 3-7pm. I was really craving a nice margarita so when I walked up to the bar and asked the bartender for a drink menu, he snarkily replied \"we don't have one\". Hmm ok...so I will just trust they have a good house margarita...boy was I wrong!! OMG DO NOT ORDER the margaritas, they are disgusting!! I even asked for sugar around the rim and they gave me salt instead. Whatever...so we are standing at the bar (no seating available at the time) and next I ordered a beer on draft. The glasses were NOT chilled so my beer became warm really quickly. What kind of bar doesn't chill the glasses for beer? From then on, I just stuck with bottled beer because I knew it would be cold and delicious, which it was :)  I didn't order any food because I was standing the whole time and had no where to eat. But, this place has TONS of TV's so it was fun to watch the game. They also have air hockey and other arcade type games too for entertainment. I think I would come back and try the food but their HH drinks were not good!! HH prices were excellent though...bottled beer was $1.75 and the margarita was $3. Maybe I should come on Tuesday for $1 tacos? Who knows.."}
{"text":"They have good drink selection and the food is okay too, but their service is really slow. I have been here at least 10 times, and can not remember ever having good or prompt service.  Also, they have 2 pool tables that are kind of gross, but still cost a dollar to play. Make it free or 50 cents at most, especially if you aren't going to keep up the table"}
{"text":"Very kick back place. Not over the top, your basic bar. The outdoor patio is pretty cool though, large open area shaped like the bow of a ship."}
{"text":"Just walked in... friday night 8pm found a table in a nearly empty room by the bar next to a table with a security guy chattin up a couple of dudes. After 4 servers walked and mins later no one said hello asked us for are drink order we after 10 min.  I guess these guys are more interested in updating Facebook with pics of the servers than selling beers. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Short and simple. Went here for Bike night and some of the worst service and most idiotic staff I've ever encountered. A friend of mine waited over an hour for a classic flatbread. The server rang that in as a classic burger and didn't even receive that. We heard the classic excuse \"The kitchen is backed up.\" I told the server that isn't an excuse. I told the manager the same thing. The establishment tried blaming the individual who made our reservation. Bad service and incompetent staff. Definitely will never go to Mad Dog again."}
{"text":"Typical food and drink you would expect from a bar so you don't expect too much  can't really mess up fried food. Service is not consistent and the waitresses need to up their game if they are the face of this business. Otherwise if you like a patio, beer, decent food, and sports teams sportsing sports...you'll feel right at home. P.s. Wings are pretty good."}
{"text":"The brochacho and I decided to try this place for the Card's playoff game. The brochacho and I decided to also never come back here again. The service was godawful. During the span of a three-hour game, our server checked on our table two times. Yes. Two. Times.  When you initially arrive the first thing you will notice is the sheer amount of security/bouncers working. Why? Because of the transient crowd this bar attracts. Never have I been to a sports bar where fans of the SAME TEAM are fighting each other. If you decide to visit, please be careful as there might be the possibility of flying crack pipes and hypodermic needles."}
{"text":"COME here for HAPPY HOUR 3pm-7pm on Fridays for sure.    I tried to log into their website  and I can't get into it.  WEIRD!  Anyhow, came here on a Friday evening and the place was packed.  Great patio area it's huge!  So many TV's so it would be a great place for watching games.  Anyhow, back to their happy hour specials 1.75 for domestic draft, 2.00 for domestic bottles, 2.50 wells drinks.  No deal on wines!  Boo!  1/2 off on all appetizers and the potato skins were great we also ordered onion rings and they had a little too much batter on them.    Our waitress was awesome!  She was attentive and super nice ....so service was great!  We didn't stay pass 8:00pm, came here only for happy hour and it was a convenient location to meet friends from east Mesa, Tempe and Chandler ...right off the Superstition 60 -easy in, easy out."}
{"text":"Went there excited to see the fights. Paid cover to get in and grabbed a seat at the bar. It wasn't packed like previous fights have been. Figured it would be a perfect fight to be out and about for. Waited at the bar for about 5 mins before we were helped... the only bad thing is that the person that greeted us was a ROACH. Literally a cockroach walked up onto the bar and across the bar. It was about 2-3 inches long so it had to of been a regular at the bar. The workers didn't even flinch. Needless to say we left, got our money back, and will not be returning. Just imagine a roach walking all over your table or even food and nesting in your cup.... enjoy your visit there, I know I won't go back ever."}
{"text":"Well we went there on Saturday (they just opened on Thursday) and it was raining.  Actually raining inside... We had to move our table 3 separate times.  Service was really slow but very friendly.  We ordered some mild boneless wings that came out extremely hot (even for my husband who loves hot and spicy foods) and also came out not boneless.  Our server was not very well acquainted with the menu or the bar so that was a little annoying, but I could tell she was trying.  She reordered the wings and again they came back not boneless... to say the least we paid our tab and left to get out of the rain.... We will go back though, the atmosphere was really nice, tons of TV's a big bar, lots of seating and gaming!!!  Also the patio was pretty nice as well."}
{"text":"This place won't be open for long... My girlfriend and I went one night at around 8 p.m. The place was not busy at all. The outside bartender was too busy flirting with her only TWO customers to get us drinks or take our order so we sat down elsewhere.  Tianna waited on us and is a SUPERB waitress. We ordered  chicken quesadilla, pork tenderloin skewers, and chicken wings. The food arrived almost immediately. I joked that they had it sitting around in the back somewhere already made. Turns out I was RIGHT!!! It was cold, sticky and DISGUSTING!! I asked to speak to a manger and when he came to our table he informed us the grill closed FORTY FIVE MINUTES AGO!!! Oh, and the manger was an absolute jerk off who came very close to getting punched in the throat. So the food was indeed pre-cooked and had been sitting around collecting bacteria for FORTY FIVE MINUTES before they served it to us...CUSTOMERS!! It's unfortunate because it is an extremely inviting place with dozens of TVs, couches, and just the coolest ambiance. But no amount of ambiance is worth getting botulism. The Health Department will have them closed in no time.  I did indeed file a report with them."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to check out this place since the change from Salty Senorita's. Although, I must admit that I was a little apprehensive since the outside (street side) does give a kind of rough and tough biker type of feel... But, the parking lot side shows the nice, new, open, game room (or man cave) type of feel this place creates.  I was surprised by the space and seating of the patio bar area! It is much bigger than when this was Salty's. The brisk night air felt good on arrival, and the heaters came on in all the right places when it started to cool down for the evening. They did a great job with the remodel, creating lots more room to mingle and chat with friends... There are also tons of flat screen tvs, set at different angles for optimum viewing.   On this saturday night, the DJ was able to light up the dance floor and get people dancing to a fixture of hip-hop and cool beats. Everyone seemed to be having a good time dancing and singing along to each song. The waitresses were busy but efficient and always pleasant and friendly.  I found the long islands to be very good, and couldn't taste too much alcohol, which was nice until... it snuck up on me later! Lol! But, it was the mozzarella sticks that my waitress recommended that will keep me coming back. They were awesome! wrapped in wonton wrappers and a larger size stick than I have seen anywhere else. These were good in the marinara sauce but even better with the ranch side sauce, a combination I have never tried before, but I loved it! A great appeitizer to share, 5 sticks for only $7!  Overall, I gave it 4 stars because I am a big fan of this cool comfortable spot with a little bit of something for everyone, especially the sports enthusiasts. Good apps. But, no drink menus? (which would be a nice addition, as I assume they serve a good amount of drinks per night) It just needs more people to visit!!"}
{"text":"Well I have to tell you, just when I think they have improved they let me down.   #1 Do not ask if I need change just because you may not want to walk back over if you don't have to. make the change and return it,  I'll let you know if i want you to keep all that's left over.   #2 Do not short me, not even a penny, it's my money, every red cent until I bestow to you the server.     Server shorted me .50  to me that is bad for business \"MAD DOGS\" Train them correctly or you will lose customers to all the other places around you.. I come for the product, but I'll keep coming back because of GREAT service.  Harry"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice change of pace and good crowd. I say if you're going to go on a Friday or weekend night try and get a spot at the outside bar. Nate, is one of the best bartenders and makes a good stiff drink. I haven't tried the food but I heard it's pretty good and every table get's complimentary popcorn to snack on.   Again there really isn't a 'type' of crowd, it's a good mix, and a good mix of music played through the night. If you're burnt out on the same dos and iguana crowd, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Some days they honor their specials, other days they try to deny you of the offers by saying that they simply can't do it when in the past they have ( past meaning the prior week). I love their burgers especially the 2 for 1 deal can't beat it... Again like I said if they honor it. I personally am fed up with being treated unfairly when it come to their deals. They need to clarify when and what specials they offer and not leave it to speculations of what waiter is there that day."}
{"text":"Just had my trip to Mad Dog with brother Bill and we had a great time. The food was well made, service was outstanding (Great job Brittany) and the atmosphere was comfortable. Get your ass to Mad Dog Saloon."}
{"text":"Visiting AZ from Cali this place was recommended by friends so we gave it a go. I don't think it was just because it was Cinco De Mayo, this place was loud (which is fine!) The outdoor patio was pretty cool. fresh breeze blowing in, people seem like locals hanging out, lots of bikers and unbelievable custom bikes! Servers were chill and friendly. Nachos were huge and filling. Would prob come back here to hang and have drinks."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go to after work and have a drink!  I've visited this place so many times I can't even count.  The interior looks like an open warehouse with table everywhere.  They do have pool tables and the food is good bar food.  Pricing is a little higher and the drink prices aren't the best but hey you can do what you want.   Bad - hate the fact that you can't change the music in their.  They have all music on a constact rotation on an IPod!"}
{"text":"The waitress was terrible. It is very possible she was new. It took forever to get service and when she did finally come around she asked \"what do you want\" really?!  Our order was incorrect and she forgot to bring our drinks twice. I recommend newbies carry a notepad and write down the orders to alleviate issues like this."}
{"text":"This place changed its menu and tried to get all fancy.  It's an outdoor dive bar, and serving tacos and regular bar fare food on fancy white square plates doesn't work. If you want a spot to stop in for a cold beer on a sunny day it's great."}
{"text":"Not good. Good happy hour prices and decent service but.... The food is subpar at best. Also it's very loud and I wouldn't recommend it for families. I've been a couple times and I won't be back"}
{"text":"I am not into guys and really don't like them for almost any purpose - but I do need them. There are women that talk to guys at the bar, and sometimes the decision on which bar to go to is based on the type of guys that go there. Word gets out that I am going somewhere that's good enough to draw 15-20 women, but much more than that requires a good base of male customers. I don't think this place is going to do that.   I selected Mad Dog Saloon for a few reasons: 1) it was a nice afternoon and they have a large patio, 2) it is a new establishment and 3) it's close to home. When I arrived I sent a text to my friend in Ohio that it was a weird combination of douche bags and bikers. His return text asked if I read the quick tips on Yelp. Admittedly, I had not. Quick Tip number 1 at the time was from Trenton T. and it said \"lots of douche bags, weird crowd\"...that sums it up well. There were four guys in close proximity to me. Two had the reverse hat going, another had the sunglasses in the back of the shirt, and the fourth appeared to be normal. The next table was a large group of bikers, as was the back of the bar. I don't think this is the crowd that is going to attract the ladies. I can't do it all myself people; work with me.  What about the good things? Yes, there were some. Good thing 1: It actually is close to my home. Within a mile, so I could easily walk back should I have to do so. Good thing 2: the Aztec burger was pretty good and at $9 it was comparable to other places, but here is the thing (Good thing 3): regular fries are included with the meal, but seasoned fries or sweet potato fries are available at no extra cost. Good thing 4: It's large. One prior review said the inside was like a warehouse - yes, but I don't mind that. It is very spacious, it has games and tvs to enjoy and plenty of seats. That's a positive to me. The outdoor seating was spacious and had a great amount of open air (and more TV0 to make the day enjoyable.  Another negative I found, besides the customers, was the service was slow. It took me a while to get an order in and get a drink. Once I did it took a while to come (even the beer). My waitress was cute though...although overall I wasn't impressed by the staff. The food was good when it did arrive and my server did check up on several times, but she seemed to be more talkative with the two dorks in the backwards hats.   Come for the sweet potato fries and the nice outdoor patio before it gets too hot. Come for a large, spacious place inside and out, but the rest of it wasn't anything to get carried away about. I will probably go again because I live so close, but maybe I will search for other better places."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night for the first time with friends. The layout and design of the place is nice. They have a nice outdoor seating area.  It was more for the younger club goer. It got louder and more \"club like\" as the night went on. If you like that sort of thing then you would like Mad Dogs. If you want to meet some friends and have a conversation over a couple of beers then I would recommend somewhere else.  I didn't try the food so my rating is based solely from that one night."}
{"text":"Beware: I just confirmed that their 'pint' glasses on 'you call it' nights are actually 12 oz and not 16oz!!! See pictures.  Shameful. Very deceiving glasses - thick base and sides.  So, you're better off ordering a BOTTLE of beer than a 'pint'."}
{"text":"Happy hour time .. This place has a good happy hour menu and a very popular $2 frozen margarita.  Place was really busy, we sat at the inside bar.. Service was quick.. Generous pour on the jack & diet.. The bartenders checked on us all evening ..   They had live music outside by the patio bar.. Music was good and people were having a good time!! The DJ set up and started his set around 9.  We ordered the massive plate of chicken nachos .. This is meant to be shared .. It was delish.. Will definitely be back for happy hour with friends."}
{"text":"So I thought I give this place a try since it was by my house and seemed like it was usually busy even on weekdays which is a good sign. Decided to go with a few buddies for taco Tuesday since they advertise dollar tacos. So we order the street tacos that were on special and some beers.  I didn't have much expectations for the street tacos because they were only a buck. But when we got them, they tasted like they were literally off the STREET! They were cold and dry and bland. Not much to them, no sauce or fixings, just dried up meat in a tortilla. They made taco bell look like 5 stars. On top of that the waitress served our beer and brought out glasses straight from the sanitizer. When I grabbed my glass it was still hot and damp, which obviously killed the beer that was in it. That was a while back and I have not been back nor will I ever go again. I don't understand why people are drawn their."}
{"text":"Driven by numerous times, stopped in on Sunday afternoon.   Good= $3 Mexican beers Bad= someone changing/adjusting lights and light bulbs with the ladder on the bar.  Then walking on the bar, right over the well.  Oh, and once done, nobody wiped down the bar!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have enjoyed going here for a beer or two. After last night we will no longer be going. Sitting out on the patio enjoying a cold beer when two guys right next to us were spitting. Spitting over the rail but not making it over the rail. Spitting on the patio floor. I requested that they are given cups to spit in and they refused to use them. I approached them to only stir them up more. Management did nothing. Their waitress did nothing but encourage them. They got more obnoxious about it after I approached them. Insisting they would \"make it over the rail\" Anyway, if this place wants to allow their customers to spit while others are trying to eat then we just won't return!"}
{"text":"Overall very nice first showing!  Drinks were cheap as hell and the place is NICELY RENOVATED.  Much more inviting and clean than Salty Senioritas.  See you there every Friday!"}
{"text":"Went to mad dogs several times and every time it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I love the food and most of the girls there are awesome but the men behind the bar, except the mustache guy, completely suck. Same for the security... my friend and i went there one night after a super long day to eat, drink a little, and watch the last half of a football game... the bartender guy with the gotee was rude about my team for starters, then was absolutely a jerk to my friend about her ID. She recently turn 21 and though i agree she looks young, they refused to believe she was the person on her ID and attributed it to the fact she wasn't wearing makeup at the time.. kind of gave me the impression they expected us to be gussied up to be there and be treated well... we will not be going back! That man was a total douche bag and acted totally above us in every way every time we've been there. Not to mention we've been there and served by him several times and still didn't remember us... the mustache man remembered us after serving us one time... give him a raise!"}
{"text":"The food is terrible, poor quality and frozen.  Their draft beer is served in plastic cups.   Who serves beer in plastic?! The servers are the most miserable bunch of brats I have ever seen.  They look like the hate their jobs so much.  This place is gross and dirty as well.  It is too bad because they have a large patio, which should be a place you would want to go."}
{"text":"Burgers are good.  But on the whole the menu is boring and the servers are not hot enough to be that damn rude."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. Great happy hour prices, and the food is less than mediocre. Waitresses are not friendly and you wait, and wait, and wait for her to come back and ask if you'd like another drink. And then you wait, and wait, and wait for your drink. This is from three separate visits, and friends say the same. Atmosphere is great, patio is very cool. Did I mention how much the service SUCKS?"}
{"text":"On a good night, this place is barely acceptable. Too bad the good nights are few & far between.   Their happy hour features the tried & oh, so boring half-price appetizers & buck off most drinks. The problem is, the drinks are a bit overpriced to start with. Tuesday is probably the bright spot, with dollar street tacos - but they aren't worth much more than a buck.  It is a very nice venue, with a lot of potential, It is reminiscent of some yuppie-type patio club in Scottsdale. The patio is large & smoking is permitted - even cigars, which they also sell.   So what brings it down to a single star? The service is HORRIBLE.  After zero acknowledgement for as much as 30 minutes...  Very attractive server: Okay, I can take your order now.  Me: I will take a...  Very attractive server: Oops, I am so sorry - I will be right back.  10 minutes later... the scene repeats.  Nearly an hour after arrival, you MIGHT get a drink. Trying to get the check, especially an accurate one, in less than 30 minutes, is nearly impossible.  Bike night on Tuesday is even worse. But bikers don't tolerate sad service, so Tuesday is a dying night at Mad Dog Saloon.  They usually have plenty of staff  wandering around. But that seems to be what they do best - wandering.  I wonder how long before this place has yet another name change.  Save yourself the headache. To the north is RT O'Sullivan's. Nothing to write home about, but at least the service won't drive you to tears. To the south is downtown Gilbert, with several venues, including Liberty Market & Champions Sports Bar - all with vastly better service."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would.  Starting from the beginning... Decided to try it tonight was in the mood for some wings walked in there's nobody even to greet you or seat you at all. We seated ourselves and waited at least 10 minutes before a server came to our table and Only  after I got up and walked around and found somebody and ask if someone could get our order. The waitress was very rude and flippant when I asked her to come to our table so we could order of food that we have been waiting for 10 minutes. Took orders but our drinks the food came to the table in a reasonable amount of time. The wings were terrible over cooked fried an old oil and the teriyaki wings had no sauce on them hardly at all. The salads were good I got a chicken Caesar my fiancé got a garden salad. What kind of a sports bar has crappy wings? The worst part was that the ranch dressing was watered-down. My glass tasted like it had soap in it.  Overall a terrible experience bad service bad food will not ever come back and will make sure we tell people that it was a terrible experience.  We so wanted to like this place. When it was time to pay the bill I thought rush because she was getting off her shift. I said out loud to her the food was terrible and she said she would adjust our check and will be right back I told her no you don't have to do that that's not why I said that    she was no it's no problem I'll take care of it. I paid the check thinking that she would bring me back change for the adjusted amount off of the bill   she never even came back so she took my money and did not ever come back with the adjusted amount. Terrible!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing says pathetic like a plastic cup to put my beer in....  Get some frozen mugs?"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday to watch football, and the experience was very average.  The menu was typical bar food.  We ordered nachos which were good.  No complaints.  The service was ok, and the prices were reasonable.  Several TVs, so good to watch any game currently playing."}
{"text":"I went on Mother's Day with my Daughter for a drink to celebrate the occation.  We have gone to Mad Dog Saloon several times in the past because we live in the neighborhood. The service is always slow but we usually go just to talk and catch up. On Mother's Day we ordered a drink after sitting at the outside bar for a long time watching the female bartender ignore us.  There were only five other people at the bar.  She placed  our bill in a glass  in front of us.  I paid her cash for both drinks. Later my daughter was asked by the same bartender for her visa card to pay for the same drinks.  I did not notice that my daughter was also paying the bill I just paid.  I assume the bartender put the cash I gave her in her tip jar instead of covering our tab.  I called the manager and he could care less that this happened and was sarcastic to me.  I assume this was the \"Special Treatment\" stated on the  the Mother's Day Welcome posted on the sign in front of the establishment.    The manager could of refunded us for one payment that we paid.  He did not.  We will not be returning and will spread the word not to give business to this establishment."}
{"text":"This place is a great place for sports and to hang out. Happy hour Monday thru Friday is awesome. This place has great food and a good time."}
{"text":"Now open for breakfast on Sunday for football. They play all the UFC fights at this bar, games...tons of outdoor seating and indoor pool tables, darts, shuffle board! They have great wings, burgers, lunch, dinner, they have these awesome things called pig wings that will change your life! Lol. Also you can get your car washed while you watch football on Sunday's! They have a service there that is awesome! I took my truck last week and it's still clean. The staff is super friendly and helpful, the bar tender Letti outside was quick and really sweet, and their bouncers are fun too. The owner was walking around greeting customers too, seemed like he knew a lot of the regulars...very legit sports bar and grill. Oh! And they have a late night food menu!"}
{"text":"Best wings! Try suicide if you want to cry. Usually get golden hot one of my favorite places to eat wings. 40 cent wings on Mondays. Good drink specials and beer pong place to be."}
{"text":"Horrible service had to move from two tables up to the bar which still took over 3 minutes to get acknowledged. Ordered an appetizer, mini corn dogs. I got 10 of them for $8 and no dipping sauce was provided which the menu indicated there would be. I watched two other tables not get service and have to walk up to the bar to get their beer because their server never returned. They were not shot staffed there were a few servers at all times just standing next to the bar. I will not be returning and would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour!!! Everyday 11-7. Food is decent, atmosphere is chill, big TV's for games, and cheap drinks"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Mad Dogs in a while because the DJ usually is just really bad, but last night the  DJ was  amazing.  He played good music the whole time I was there.  Hopefully he stays because if he is there next time I go I would definitely tell more friends to go there.  Good job Mad Dog on hiring this guy.  :)"}
{"text":"Watching cardinals game here is a blast, drinking beers after work again is a blast. Great specials on drinks and it's lively... now the menu is a minefield... lettuce wraps had no flavor, and the skillet with fries and buffalo chicken should be served with a side of tums.... no only is it tearing my stomach apart as I'm watching Sunday night football, I think it's giving me a ulser and burning a hole in my stomach lining. I'm almost not enjoying the rest of my night, because I have to poo but after all that buffalo sauce I'm afraid it's gonna burn. My buddy had the bam burger he said that was great. Service is good and overall ok, next time I'll stop at in and out to get food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Obviously nothing happening. Didn't really have the Olympics or Golf on, but there was baseball, etc.  The food was OK. The Philly Cheesesteak was not from Philly, that is for sure. Only meat and YELLOW cheese.  There were plenty of fries and the curly ones tasted the best. I will go back but mainly for a sporting event. I like their one bar inside and one bar outside setup. During football season, this place should rock!"}
