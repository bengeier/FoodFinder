{"text":"Have been here a couple different times with the family for a spontaneous dinner or after sporting events and have had good service.  The one thing is if you go at peak times it is packed or you are waiting to be seated or if you go late for lunch or earlier for supper there are slim pickings for pizza and chicken, granted they will make what ever you want if you just ask but waiting is truely the hard part when there is plenty of other things to eat.  So by the time your special pizza makes it out to you most of the time you are to full already to eat any more.  Nothing to complain about I just need a little patience.  May favorite pizza is the buffalo chicken and the cactus bread with ice cream is delicious as well.  
One word of advice do not come here if you have missed lunch you will for sure leave with a extra full stomach.  Lol."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday for lunch several weeks after they opened.  The parking lot was full which I took as a good sign, but popularity is not a sign of quality.  When you arrive you don't actually get to see the buffet before you order as it is around the corner.  I thought that it would be like a better Cicis pizza but it wasn't even that good.  They only have 6 small pizzas on the buffet for a dining room that seats hundreds of people, but they are actually doing you a favor.  The pizza itself is not very good, it tasted like food service pizza you might have gotten from a high school cafeteria.  They add exotic toppings to make it a little more palatable but the crust cheese and sauce are so poor that it is a failed effort. 

The other aspects of the salad bar don't fare much better.  The pictures of the salad bar show a hearty looking spring mix, but the reality was that the salad was shredded iceburg like you might put on a taco.   This is not an exaggeration, that was the actual lettuce that was present.  Even though the name of the place is pizza ranch there were a lot more non pizza items present like fried chicken etc.  This place must bank of one time visits, because I can't see anyone going more than once."}
{"text":"The chicken is great!  The pizza is fabulous!  A good variety on the buffet everytime we have been there.  The dessert pizza is my favorite.  Great service.  We have been there 3 times and they have been open less than a month!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet price a bit high but fried chicken, real potato chips, and buffalo ranch chicken pizza keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"#neveragain will I eat that so called food. The bathroom was nice to use since the food made me.  

I will avoid this place. 

The food is bad.

Try it like I wanted too. I was wrong. You'll agree it's crap."}
{"text":"Pizza Ranch is a great place to bring the family for lunch or dinner!  It has a wide variety of food on the buffet including pizza, chicken, create your own salads, and desserts complete with ice cream.  

Pizza Ranch has a program called \"Buffet Your Way\" If you don't see your favorite pizza on the buffet you can ask any of the staff and they will bring the first slice out to your table!"}
{"text":"me with my fiancee came up to wisconsin together with our friend to visit her sister.

it was sunday so right after the church service we decided to go to this place, because we were a big group and we want to eat a good lunch together. so when we got to the place the line was long amd we just have to wait patiently to pay and be seated. it was busy and the dining room is full.

we were a party of 8people and the staff are very friendly and attentive with our needs. including on fixig a table for us. so that was a plus customer service is always important on a restaurant. 

now into food. the pizza Im not a big pizza lover but it was good the pizza taco. barbeque and steak n onion was good but average for my taste.. the best part for me was the fried chicken. I think overall I had like 6 piece. it was so good fresh hot crispy chicken. i mean the chicken is better than the pizza. they should change the name. lol

but anyways everyone enjoyed the meal. i couldn't try much of the desserts because I was so full already. maybe next time when we come back I will go lite on the pizza more chicken and add room for dessert.

definitely will be back when come again to this area!!"}
{"text":"We were there yesterday and the food and service were great. Their fried chicken is some of the best in Madison. Staff are polite and friendly. Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday evening with our 5 year old son. The buffet has about 10 pizzas with more coming out constantly. If you want one that isn't there, they will make it special for you. There is also a salad bar and fried chicken bar. The pizza tastes like frozen pizza. That being said my 5 year declared it the best pizza he ever had! The dessert pizza with the ice cream was tasty. I will likely be back at my sons request. I just wish the price for adults wasn't so high- 11 bucks."}
{"text":"Opening Day! I've been driving past and waiting for this to open and today is the day. And it's been going great. 

Walked in the door to find it's more spacious than any other PRanch I've been to. Welcomed at the door by someone from the corporate office. Friendly staff everywhere. Food was hot and ready. And most importantly, excellent. Pizza crust was perfect. Chicken was perfect. 

Only recommendation: get those dessert pizzas out early! I like to eat dessert first. Just to make sure there's room. 

Can't wait to be a regular here. Way to go guys! Keep it up!

UPDATE: the dessert pizza was hiding in plain sight right behind me!"}
{"text":"Sooo it's a trough, just trying to be honest.  If you want to stuff your self and don't care about taste go for it. The pizzas were just ok, they supposedly have delivery and take out, I don't know why anyone would ever do this option because the only up side is that you can stuff your self till you burst ala Mr Creosote (just remember don't eat the mint) . 
    The dessert pizzas and are OK but horribly sweet but I guess their playing to their crowd . My children love it so I will probably be dragged back their again."}
{"text":"Yuck! When your main business is pizza and the chicken is better than the pizza...you have issues."}
{"text":"This place is a sure winner.  Affordable prices, The best chicken, good stuffing with the chicken, fabulous pizza, great desserts, Coke brand soft drinks, soft serve ice-cream, did not try the salad bar.  Just about everything about this restaurant is perfect - It deserves 5 stars - And I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Don't seem to care at all. Very unorganized and unprofessional. All they care about is themselves. Pretty disappointing for a so called Christian company."}
{"text":"I like the concept and most of their products taste ok.  The staff is always friendly. 

That said, they seem to have a problem keeping food hot.  The heat lamps over the pizza are not doing the job, with pizza just at room temperature, and the chicken is just plain cold.  It's a shame - because they are starting with a decent product."}
{"text":"Five stars for the take out fried chicken. Hands down the best fried chicken in Sun Prairie. 

However, the restaurant and buffet, I'd give it a 2.5 star if I could. There isn't much variety for a buffet. And for a pizza buffet, there isn't very many pizzas out on the buffet line. Now, they do say you can request any pizza and they'll make it and bring you the first slice, but when you're at a buffet... You just want to eat and go, not sit around waiting for a request. Even the pizza hut buffet has more pizza variety on the buffet line."}
{"text":"Went in expecting too much. This place is like Pizza Hut. You can order from the menu or you can pay for pizza buffet. There isn't much of a choice of pizzas out but you can always request for a pizza and they will serve you the first slice when they finish making it, then they set it out for the rest of the customers to try."}
{"text":"One of my daughter's single requests for our weekend away was to eat at Pizza Ranch.

I think the food is decent. And the garlic cheese pizza is our favorite. It wasn't out on this visit, so we had to request it. And it did take quite awhile.... but it was a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"My group and I ate here three times, and each of us got sick three times. We contacted the board of health. Who knows if anything changed. Our group always noticed we never saw any adults working there. Ever! Good luck!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat if you going to Madison I go there but every other weekend when I go to see my daughter in Oregon Wisconsin they make fun of me because that's where I say I want to go eat I love the food and the pizza the people there are nice and polite and a treat my grandson like he's a little angel they're always nice to him so if you get a chance stop here and eat you will like it I'm hoping one day that they'll put one in Chicago Ridge Illinois"}
{"text":"I ate here about two weeks ago with my daughter and son-in-law that live in Oregon and the pizza was very good my wife liked it because it had other things The people that work there were very nice and polite I will eat here again"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is so filling and everyone gets to eat what they want.  I really like the BLT pizza and their fried chicken."}
{"text":"They really know how to take plates.

Big fan.

Now open till 8pm

Their volunteer ballet wait staff sashayed into my heart."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  I like the chicken better than KFC"}
{"text":"The food was good especially the chicken. Love their chicken and steak and onion pizza. On a side note I will never come back any night they have their magician there. . How annoying. He forces his card tricks on you and won't leave until you tip him. As he pretty much begs for money. I came for dinner not to have a card magician forced on me. Totally ruined the dinner and all of us 6 at the table agreed."}
{"text":"If McDonald's opened a pizza place this would be it. If you like mediocre fast foodesque pizza and a thousand kids running around this is your place. I tried it once and highly highly doubt I'd ever come back"}
{"text":"This rating is for a pick up at the window. I have ordered and had a few issues with pick up but tonight was not good. I sat at the drive thru window for 10 minutes and had 5 staff look right at me and ignored me.  The food has been decent if not a bit over priced but this was not acceptable. When we did get our order it was not hot.  Not going back!"}
{"text":"We came here and it was fairly busy. The pizza was good, not great. The dessert pizza is fabulous. Very good salad bar. Options like fried chicken, potatoes, soup, and fries for the non-pizza eaters. If you want a flavor of pizza that you do not see on the buffet, tell a hostess and they will make it and bring it to your table! Great service. Not very clean on the interior, however."}
{"text":"Good buffet need more sauces/condiments though! The Sun Prairie location offers BBQ sauce, ketchup A1sauce hopefully this location will follow. Fried chicken is delicious pizzas are decent and lots of variety of pizzas are available"}
{"text":"Good buffet best fried chicken hands down. Friendly service, clean restaurant, pizza so-so but some interns choices would recommend the mac& Cheese pizza.. Will eat hear again"}
{"text":"Desperately seeking a family friendly and moderately priced buffet in a clean and friendly environment?  This Pizza Ranch is the ticket. 

This is part of a pizza and chicken chain.  In Wisconsin, they have other locations in Wisconsin Dells, Baraboo, Manitowoc, and Waupun, at the least.  

For what they are, I think they do it very well and do not know another place like it here. 

A wide variety of pizzas, great fried chicken and a solid salad bar are the primary attractions and always well-stocked.  Two soups, biscuits and gravy, wedge cut potatoes, vegetables, soft serve and dessert are also on the menu.  They have a nice variety of fountain drinks and coffee.

It is a pretty big place and I believe they can accommodate larger groups pretty well. They also have a couple of rooms they can quarter off if you need some separation from the main dining room.  The motif is fun and kitschy country-western.  I do not recall hearing any country-western music and if they were playing it, it was muted and not annoying. 

It is self serve but the courteous table attendants regularly check on you to clear plates and ask if you need anything. You can also request that they make a special pizza which they will bring to you and serve. 

Their fried chicken is awesome.  Also, grab a mug of coffee with some soft serve ice cream. Delicious summertime treat!

We have been there a number of times since it opened a couple years back.  We have been there during busy times but it has never felt chaotic or that you were in the middle of a stampede.  I typically avoid buffets and the mall during the holidays for that very reason.  But somehow this Pizza Ranch seems to manage and keep things civilized. Perhaps it is our good Wisconsin manners.

See you there! Yelp on."}
{"text":"It was really good. I loved the ice cream and the mashed potatoes were the bomb but the pizza wasn't great. The staff was super helpful and always walking around and taking plates off our table. It was overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Great place to go with kids. Good pizza, superb chicken and all the fixins. Also some tasty dessert pizzas and ice cream."}
{"text":"This Pizza Ranch is no different than the Baraboo or Portage location. For the folks complaining you obviously didn't enjoy the chicken. I agree the pizza selection is slim pickings, however I rarely eat the pizza. I'm all for the chicken here which is way better than anything Colonel Sanders could have ever touched. 

The restaurant is large and is exactly like the Portage location. Ample parking, buffet prices are kind of high, $10 for lunch buffet? Really! 

I'm sure I'll be back, I had been making the drive to Baraboo/Portage to enjoy that chicken. Now I can finally enjoy it closer."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken on the planet!!!  Pizza is average at best.  Giisld selection of sides and great salad bar.  Staff is friendly and you can get in and out quickly.   Sold rename their place Chicken Ranch and eliminate the name Pizza in it!"}
{"text":"Want to stuff your fat face? This is the place. Want good pizza in Sun Prairie? Easy since there are so many great pizza places. Just yelp it"}
{"text":"Blech!! Poor-quality fare. Really no reason to go here. Went once with the kids - that's enough. Since you're using Yelp to find a quality place to eat, continue your search. Definitely quantity over quality here."}
{"text":"I went for lunch here with my husband. I had weight loss surgery several months ago and my eating is very restricted. I showed them the card from my doctor and told them I could only eat a small amount. Could I please have the children's meal price. They out and out refused. So I was made to pay the full price...for a buffet and a drink I can't drink! $10 for two chicken wings and 1/4 cup mashed potatoes.  NOT a very Christian place when they can't accommodate someone and need to be greedy by charging what they did. I don't mind paying full price when I can take home the leftovers and have another 4 meals out of it!  I've never had this done to me at any other restaurant since I had my surgery!! Done with Pizza Ranch!!!!!"}
{"text":"About what you would expect from a pizza chain in Sun Prairie.  We had a coupon for a free regular pizza, which was pretty good.  The buffet looks like a solid deal, especially if you are there with a family.

Service was very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Cashier was super friendly, food was pretty good.  They had a whole bunch of employees here, which was good for customer service because they picked up our empty plates fast.  The restaurant was really clean as well.  A suggestion would be if employees are walking around, they should offer to refill drinks but it's obviously not required.  All and all a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm kind of addicted to this place. Love coming here to get my pizza fix in. Definitely recommend the buffalo chicken and the Mac and cheese pizza. And always get the cherry dessert pizza!! My fiancé really likes their fried chicken. Only wish is they would have toppings the kids could put on their soft serve icecream."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty decent overall. Plenty of different choices on the menu. However, I've been there on days where they keep the pizza fresh and a variety available on the buffet, and I have been there on days where they are so slow and keep bringing it the same pizzas, leaving little variety. 

The rest of the buffet choices are what you would expect from a buffet. Fried chicken, fries, corn on the cob, mashed potatoes ect. Fried Chicken is good but the rest leaves little to be desired. They also offer a cold area with your standard salad choices and fixings. 

Don't bother with the soups. 

Desert buffet is good, have to admit the Cactus bread is amazingly gluttonous. The soft serve on the dessert buffet is made with real milk and isn't that weird cheap ice milk crap. And goes great with the fruit pizza and Cactus bread. 

Service is ok. Staff is always around to clear dishes. But occasionally it seems as though the staff are being in the kitchen. 

Great deal on Tuesday if you have kids under 11."}
{"text":"We paid $12 for the buffet which includes at least 12 different pizzas, fried, BBQ chicken, stuffing, potatoes, gravy, green beans, salad bar, dessert pizzas, ice cream essentially a lot of food. They carry coke drink products. 
They staff was helpful and friendly. We sat by 20 different groups with kids and grandparents. A nice Sunday meal before heading home.  It was a fun place to dine."}
{"text":"Pizza ranch has delicious food! The one downside is that when we went, it was closing at 8 so they stopped making dessert pizzas at 7:15pm and we never got any. Other than that it was a great place and we plan to go back!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to a Pizza Ranch was last fall while traveling through Iowa. I was pretty excited to hear one opened in Verona, so we took the kids last night. 

It's an all-you-can-eat pizza buffet, with a salad bar and a fried chicken bar. The pizza is decent (though nothing spectacular). They have many different varieties, and when you come in you can request any type of pizza you want for them to put on the buffet. I personally enjoyed their bacon cheeseburger pizza, complete with pickles. The salad bar has your typical offerings. The fried chicken looked good, though I did not partake.

Dessert pizzas were, naturally, my favorite. They had cherry, apple, blueberry, and peach varieties along with vanilla soft serve ice cream if you felt so inclined.

Price was just over $11 per adult (includes a fountain soda). Our 1-year-old cost 85 cents - which in and of itself was a good deal. 

This place certainly isn't fine dining - it's a buffet, people. However, I thought it was a great family atmosphere and an easy place to take our toddler. Staff was very friendly. Great family restaurant."}
{"text":"Right after we arrived, so did 90 people on tour buses from UW Stout. The staff knew they were coming because the special dining room plus additional tables were marked off for them. However, knowing in advance didn't help the output of pizza. The Stout people descended upon the buffet like hordes of flies, and when they walked away there was nothing left. People were literally standing around the buffet table waiting for the next pizzas to come out. 

Unfortunately, as soon as more pizzas came out, the Stout people rudely budged their way in and took everything. At one point, I was standing there watching the pizza disappear in front of me as grabby hands were reaching all around frantically, and some twat from Stout yells in my ear \"OMG I still haven't had like any pizza!\" She said it repeatedly. So many times in fact, I thought about slapping her with an empty pizza pan.

Shame on you UW Stout team of whatever sport you were representing, for your lowest common denominator behavior, and shame on you Pizza Ranch for not being adequately prepared, thus letting the rest of your customers have a miserable experience."}
{"text":"My thoughts on this was \"...not horrible\".

Pizza Ranch works well when you have growing teens that you just need to fill up.  Not recommended if you are a diet because the salad bar is pretty bleak, you won't be satisfied and definitely not get your money's worth.  But if you need a good old fashioned carbo load, this is your place.

Besides pizza, they also have fried chicken, corn, carrots, potato wedges and few other standards if you are like me and aren't a pizza fan.  As the name implies, they also have a decent selection of pizza although don't expect Glass Nickel quality because you know they are in back churning it out as fast as they can.  I didn't bother with the \"dessert pizza\" -- not worth the calories for me.

I found the online menu a little confusing.  Although it provided a buffet price, there was also a la carte pricing which made me wonder if those other food items were included in the buffet.  Fortunately, they were and perhaps that pricing was for carry-out.  Beverage was included in the buffet price.

On a final note, what I thought was the most interesting part of the \"experience\" was when you ask them to make a custom pizza they bring it to you first, serve you and then (I assume) put any remainder on the buffet.  Certainly, a clever way to ensure you get the freshest possible pizza."}
{"text":"Arrived at 7:30pm on a Friday night.  Parking lot was pretty fulll, no line at the counter and the cashier was very friendly.  That's where most of the \"goodness\" ended.  There was multiple dirty tables and the only open tables seemed to be for large parties.  We sat at a table for 10, just the two of us.  Pizza was nothing great, I agree with the other reviewers on that.  They did have a BBQ chicken pizza that was pretty good.  Their fried chicken was really good....I would get that again, but I'd probably get a drive thru order.  The dirty tables remained dirty until a customer looking for a seat asked if the space could be cleaned.  That was disheartening...there were 6 tables in plain sight that were clearly vacated and ready to be cleaned, which were not touched in the 40 minutes we were there.  If you are looking for good pizza and clean seating, this is not the place I'm afraid."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Pizza Ranch in the Dells. It's my favorite place to after going to water parks. I went to this one after going there. I was hoping it was equally good. Unfortunately it's not. They use a different crust which is my biggest disappointment. They still have two of my other big loves though. The cheese sticks are probably my favorite from any pizza place and the cactus dessert bread thing is stupidly good. The pizza is pretty good. The staff usually gets out your requests pretty quickly. Sometimes they're slow on weekday lunches.  

The weird part? How Jesus-y it is. I didn't notice in the Dells or even the first few times here. My boyfriend and I went to lunch one day and he noticed a few things. Then all of a sudden we noticed it everywhere. From the weird Jesus country music to the wall plaques. It makes me a little uncomfortable. Not enough to deter me, but enough to make me want to weirdly talk about liberal things which I don't normally do at restaurants."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. Fantastic food ,service and price.  They have a great salad bar with a lot of choices. The chicken is out of this world.  The pizza is great as well and I love the fact that you can ask for a pizza to be made if your favorite is not one the buffet. The thin crust is very crispy and my favorite.  Save room for the dessert pizza and ice cream.  On top of it all my family loves eating somewhere that plays Christian music in the background.  This place is our favorite restaurant in Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"It says the closing time is 9pm. But it was closed at 8pm and they were sweeping/cleaning when people are still inside. Too bad service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here on several occasions and I'm done with it based on how dirty this place was.  If it is this dirty where the customers are, how bad is it where they make the food?!?!

The floor was sticky everywhere like they washed it with soda.  At 5:30 it seemed like they didn't have a chance to clean up from the lunch rush.  It was hard to find a clean table with 2/3rds of them being empty.  

I gave this place another try (I thought it was kind of dirty before) because I got the new flyer starting new ownership and management.  Corporate pizza ranch may want to try again. 

I filled out their online survey expressing my disappointment from eating their about a month ago and didn't hear anything in response, so it's time to share my disappointment on Yelp.  Many better options in Verona, even in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza or chicken. The restaurant is clean and the buffet is always well stocked. It's a family favorite!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night at about 6:00 for my son's birthday dinner they gladly took are money but there was little to no food. Yes no food. There were no pizza out just a few cheese sticks.. chicken all gone and just about everything on that stand were chicken is was gone. You could see the crumbs of food that  was there. Unacceptable. I asked for a manager and thus young guy cones out and had no comments accept he only has been a manager a month or so???

30 mins to get chicken because you had like 50 people wanting chicken. Then 20 mins out comes 1 pizza. Yes 1

Terrible service. Also salad bar was also out of salad. Not happy at all"}
{"text":"pizza is ok the kids liked it more then the adults chicken was good had fried or bbq liked the mashed pototes snd gravy would much prefer regular not shreaded lettuce on salad soup was average liked the dessert pizza had good variety of flavors could use more then just vanilla ice cream overall an ok meal nothing special but not horible either under 40 bucks for 2 adults and 3 kids"}
{"text":"99% of the time the pizza isn't worth eating. If I were running a pizza buffet, I would ensure there as always a pepperoni and a cheese pizza on the buffet - there never is. The chicken is the best thing here. However, I am usually pleasantly surprised by the salad bar. All you can eat soft-serve ice cream isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Felt like good ol' heart-stopping fried chicken and didn't want to go through the distress of going to the KFC again, so thought, what the heck, Pizza Ranch has better reviews for their chicken than pizza. So, I found myself a deal online and ordered some fried fowl for delivery.

First, I will say, it did arrive faster than quoted, so that's always nice. I only ordered chicken and a side of mashed potatoes because I'm cheap and would rather have carbs over vegetables for a side any day. The mashed potatoes and gravy were a little to reminiscent of KFC for my tastes. Not horrible, just bland mashed potatoes with bland \"chicken\" gravy. But, it wasn't like I was expecting grandma's homemade mashed potatoes, so they get a pass. 

As for the chicken. Well, it was good. I just really wanted to like it more than I did. It was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside like all good fried chicken should be. However, where I felt it was lacking was taste. The meat just seemed under-seasoned and a little too bland. Still, for fried chicken, Pizza Ranch is at least two steps ahead of KFC. And a bonus point for not making me sick. I probably won't be coming here for pizza, but the fried chicken will most likely bring me back as it's the closest I've found in the area that resembles the fried chicken recipe from my youth."}
{"text":"Ive been going Pizza Ranches since 2000 when I lived in Sioux Falls/Iowa. Probably more than 400 visits total. Ive been to this one more than 50 times.  Out of all the PR this one has an issue with keeping up with the buffet. Several times Ive been here in the middle of buffet time and there has been close to no pizza's and/or the chicken was completely out. Next time Ill take a photo and upload it. Standing around waiting for several minutes for then to appear 2 cheese sticks, garlic cheese, etc. That highlights another common issue here, lack of variety with Pizzas. Most people don't want to see 2 cheese sticks, 1 cheese pizza, 1 garlic cheese, 2 pepperoni and some bizarre customer request. 

It also takes them a while to get around and clean used tables up and wipe them down. We like to use a booth and several times I had to wipe it down myself.

I just went past the dessert pizza bar and my hands were full so no pic but it was bare. My wife noted the same thing several minutes before I went passed it. So what will happen now is when it shows up people have been waiting so long it will all be gone again within minutes.....Update...And thats exactly what happened...waited 10-15mins with multiple trips to the dessert bar and I guess my timing was wrong, I turned up to find 2 empty pizza trays.

I do love Pizza Ranch along with my kids, this one is just poorly run at times."}
{"text":"1st time and will not return. Poor quality food from the pizza to the extremely low end salad bar. If you want to fill up on bad food this is your place. One positive was the girl clearing plates. For 12 bucks there are many better options for real food."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time this afternoon with my family. Most of the reviews were correct. Pizza was just ok, chicken was pretty good, salad bar was good but like the other guy said the only lettuce they had was the kind you'd put on tacos (shredded) .. I still enjoyed it tho. Loved the breadsticks and marinara sauce. The ice cream and dessert pizza was good too. Kids loved it. Boyfriend said he'd give it 2 1/2 stars.. He liked it but didn't like the price and I agree it's a little expensive for such a small selection of food."}
{"text":"I really like this place clean, lots of pizza choice for desert as well plus they have some pretty good salad. Comfy seating. Good parking. Pretty happy with it."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, the chicken is great, but failing to plan for a baseball team they knew was coming....this is awful."}
{"text":"I like this place solely because I'm a fat guy and when I compare myself to their average clientele, I feel better about myself.  

It's all you care to eat.  That's nice.  You can eat your fill.  You won't feel cheated.  

That being said, you're eating cardboard pizza that's no better than Little Caesar's.  The fried chicken is okay, but it's paired with that nuclear green gravy and instant potatoes, so that takes it down a notch.

You go here when you feel like gorging until you have to buy a new a belt, not because it's good or anything.

That is its only gift to you."}
{"text":"Meh. That word couldn't describe this place any more perfectly. 

Now first things first, it's a buffet. Second, it's a cheesy western-themed buffet that serves fried chicken and pizza. (???) It's almost like it's having an identity crisis or something. I don't really get it. But, regardless, it's a cheesy buffet and you have to know that going in. 

For me personally there are two key ingredients to a successful buffet that will make me want to return again and again (because who don't actually love a buffet, when it's done right?!). 

Fresh Food
&
Clean Restaurant

Now the cleanliness of this joint wasn't horrible. I was there during the busy lunch hour and it's typical for a place to get a little disheveled mid-day. Whatever. Could it have used a few more bussers? Yes. Could it have used a fresh sweep? Yes. Was it gross? By no means.

But the freshness. UGH. It just wasn't there. The products seems very processed, the salad bar was wilted, the fried chicken was stale. It was a bummer. The soup had that type of film over it when it hasn't been stirred or touched in a while. The pizza just doesn't seem like it's made with high quality ingredients. I was able to load up a pretty decent salad, but even the salad bar was lacking in terms of available toppings. 

Would I go back? Only if someone *really* wanted to go, and wanted me to go with them. I would give them another shot. But for now I am happy eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's not terrible, but it's pretty far from great. Hardly any toppings.
Their blueberry dessert pizza was quite good tho. Best slice we had.
We will not return."}
