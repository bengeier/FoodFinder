{"text":"Here's another place I go to fairly often because of proximity to my office (always a significant factor when it is -27 and windy)!!

That being said, I do come back once a week, and like it for more than it just being nearby.

This shop is essentially a takeout counter, but one where they prepare your food to order.    There is ** one ** table and chairs if you absolutely need a place to dine in.  But if you do, you will more than likely be surrounded by people waiting for THEIR takeout orders.    

Typically I'll grab a lunch special, which for $10.95 you will get a California roll, 3 pcs. of sushi (salmon, tuna, shrimp), and 5 pcs. sashimi (salmon & tuna).  As well, miso soup, and salad.     Not a bad amount of food for the price.  

You can create your own roll / sushi combo as well, for 10% off the individual prices.  The spicy tuna rolls are good, with a non-mayo hot sauce.  

Prices for the \"standard\" rolls range from $4 to $10.   \"Special rolls, \" such as a rainbow, go from $12 to $15.   Some of these are fairly elaborate, with an effort on \"plating and presentation,\" despite being takeout.  

Always friendly behind the counter, and pretty quick despite only two people doing the prep.   They probably do a pretty good business with the number of condos surrounding it."}

{"text":"I just recently  moved to Calgary and have been looking for a good sushi place. The first time I went here I mistook it for a restaurant but it's just a quick sort of \"fast food\" sushi place. Our order came to $40 which is surprising for a place like this. I went a second time during lunch and both times I've been there the sashimi was partially frozen in the centre. The rolls are decent, sort of like the ones you'd get at Chinook Centre in the food court. Overall I wouldn't return unless I was downtown between 11am-2:30pm since they have an $11.65 (or something like that) lunch special which I wasn't made aware of until after I ordered and I ended up paying over $20 for an order of California rolls and an order of salmon sashimi."}
{"text":"Tiny little take-out place filled with Japanese decorations.  Friendly staff and fast service.  Food is alright.  There are quite a bit of selection to choose from for a take-out place - thumbs up for that.  If you live around that area and don't feel like cooking, this is a good place to go to for a \"home-made\" meal."}
{"text":"$17 for sashimi??? I was surprised and not too impressed.  The service was also mediocre and everything was overpriced."}
{"text":"Cute little take out sushi place, right across the street of end of the line train station in downtown. Street parking, or impark lot behind the building. 

Lots of different rolls to choose from, or $8.95 lunch specials that come with a California roll, 3 peices of sushi and a cooked item. Always been really fresh when I've ate here and really really quick. Definately not a eat in place, but everything always arrives home in order, and really neatly packed. 

Never had a complaint here and has been yummy every time!"}
{"text":"Always excellent. Delicious, creative maki, HUGE, very good prices. Spicy tuna rolls are so, so beautiful."}
