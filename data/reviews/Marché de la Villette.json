{"text":"Had lunch here on a Monday after visiting the science museum.  The food was pretty mediocre. I had the cassoulet which was very tomatoey. My wife had the choucroute which was under seasoned and the sauerkraut itself insufficiently aged. It did not taste like the cabbage was seasoned with wine nor were the meats cooked in the oven with the sauerkraut.  The coup de grace was not being served mustard with the choucroute.  The wines by the glass were extremely limited, which no self-respecting French restaurant would do.  Walk 2 blocks and get a shawarma instead. It will be quicker, cheaper, and likely more satisfying."}
{"text":"After a good deal of walking around the cobblestone streets of Old Montreal, we worked up enormous appetites. Desiring French food, we took a chance at Marché de la Villette and had the most satisfying and delicious meal of our lives. The French onion soup and Cabrel burger truly were to die for. We cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Had late lunch here after 3 hour walking tour with friends. The food was great, we had 2 burgers (delish), French onion soup with goat cheese (amazing with deep flavor), sandwich with merguez sausage and one with salmon. Also, they serve very delish sangria with cucumber and mint. Great and tasty food in a beautiful ambience."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. A portal into Montreal's Frenchness, with amazing duck and rabbit terrine, charcuterie plate to die for (perhaps literally), delicious French onion soup and the kids loved the hot chocolate. Passes the authentic totally French perfect vibe test. And it's an old school butcher and provisions store to boot. If only I could have stopped myself before eating ALL the food. A must visit in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Eh...nothing special!  It's a small and sweet little place you want to like, but the food and coffee were both luke warm upon arrival and for the price, I'd like my breakfast, fast, hot and tasty. This place was neither.  The staff was sweet and yes, busy, yet it didn't feel like I was neglected, just unimpressed by it all."}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere I'm coming back for the French onion soup I have a feeling it will not disappoint. I had the croque-madame and it was good however I would recommend requesting a steak knife to help cut into the French bread. Otherwise delicious. Beautiful deli case. I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This restaurant is unique in that it is the only restaurant I've ever left and then immediately gone to find other food. I also feel bad to write this as a Yelp review without having talked to the staff in person, but there is no way to explain how truly crazy it is inside and how little you see your server.  Was  planning on going to another place in the neighbourhood but it was closed, and was attracted to the very charming exterior of this restaurant. Looking up the reviews later, it seems like this is a pretty hot and cold place, and my guess is when they are busy their service is heavily impacted. I can definitely see how this would be a good restaurant if the service was better, the atmosphere is fun and the menu is creative.  Unfortunately, the day we went was very busy. We were seated immediately and given the crowd our server was fast with taking our orders/ bringing coffee. The issue came later - probably about 20-30 minutes after ordering our breakfasts. The server came to me (not my partner) and said my order couldn't be done, they were out, could I have a bacon croissant (instead of the vegetarian cassoulet I had ordered). I told her I was vegetarian and asked her if there was a veggie option instead, she told me she didn't have time to wait for me to decide and ran off. I'd totally get that if this was my initial order and I was making her wait, but this was her coming to me maybe 30 minutes after I ordered and asking me to on the fly come up with a second order, without a menu or anyway of knowing what dishes I could eat. I called after her that was fine, I would have a vegetarian omelet (the only other veggie dish I remembered).  Then the food came. Ends up it was my boyfriend's western croissant that was cancelled, not my cassoulet (which made her bacon croissant offer way more understandable, although I wish she had taking 30 seconds to explain this at the table). Before we started eating our server did check in, and we told her we needed cutlery. Once we had the cutlery she did not come back to check in, if she had I would have explained to her the mix-up, as well as the fact that my vegetarian cassoulet had chunks of ham throughout it. My boyfriend ended up eating the cassoulet (not great, even ignoring the meat chunks) and as I really hated the omelet he ate that as well. Our server never came back except for 2 seconds to drop off the check with a \"love you guys, thanks!\" Would never recommend going back, at least not on a busy day."}
{"text":"The wife & I hit this place up for lunch twice on our most recent Montreal visit.  We were staying Vieux Montreal for the first time as opposed to just walking through as we had in the past and we excited to find this place.  It really encapsulated what I love about the city, you feel like you got away to Europe with the obscene airfare.  The food was very good and the service was excellent, the gentleman waiter was very personable and entertaining.  It took my 4th trip to Montreal to get here, but it's now a regular stop."}
{"text":"This was the freshest most superb small French bistro. The restaurant was quite popular and I can see why. The meats, cheeses and pates were incredible. Our service was cheerful and a special request was accepted and served beyond our expectations."}
{"text":"What a great experience.    6/5 stars go to Sarah, our amazing waitress who was funny, personable, and dead on with respect to the food recommendations.  She made this place an extra special 5 stars.    We walked into this place at about 3 in the afternoon, attracted by the bright window display and the ham models hanging in the window.  Unfortunately, we were told that the kitchen was closed because the kitchen was busy stuffing turkeys.  The only options for us?  Sandwiches, charcuterie plate, and the cheese plate.  Poor us.    Feeling not a bit disappointed, we order the rillette de canard sandwich, the roast beef sandwich, the charcuterie plate and the cheese plate.  The food arrives at our table, and it is huge.  The cheese plate was piled high, as was the charcuterie plate.  The charcuterie plate, in particular, was a steal at $14.95 - home made pates, terrines, rillette and assortment of meats.  Everything was fresh and lovely.  Sandwiches were generously stuffed.  The Rillette de Canard sandwich (recommended to us by Sarah) was to die for.  The four of us ate and ate and ate, and still there was more food on the table!  At the end of it all, we decided to order some more rillette de canard to take home with us (we were due to board our plane that evening).  All of that food, including the extra rillette, and a glass of wine came up to $89.00 not including tip.  A true steal.    I would highly recommend this place as an affordable and yummy option in old Montreal!"}
{"text":"Came here w friends spur of the moment. French onion soup was delish and I got the smoked meat on a French baguette which was yummy! The service is a little \"slow\" but I'm a jersey guy and have little patience.  However their place was very well decorated and felt like welcoming. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Took too long to get seated even though there were many spots open. Took too long to get food and the food was not good. I wanted a refill on coffee and ketchup and I didn't get that because the server never came to check if everything was good. Also took too long to pay because they didn't know how to add \"extra egg\" to the bill."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere! Servers singing as they worked.  Excellent foie gras, fondue and sangria! Great people watching spot."}
{"text":"Nous sommes arrivés dans ce restaurent par hasard. Le restaurent ou nous comptions aller étant fermé, nous avons choisi celui de l'autre côté de la rue.   Ce restaurent à tout pour charmer, un décor folklorique français, une charcuterie au fond et plusieurs produits du terroir français. Le reste se gâte rapidement. La soupe à l'oignon était définitivement une base à soupe au poulet en poudre, pour le prix c'était inacceptable. Le repas principal  à été la feuillantine comtoise pour moi et la quiche lorraine pour ma copine.  La première porte du restaurent qui sert à isoler du froid extérieur est restée ouverte tout le long du repas et la grande circulation de clients nous donnais l'impression de manger sur une terrasse en hiver. J'ai poliment demandé au serveur si il pouvait fermer la porte, puisque nous avions froid. Non seulement il a refusé prétextant que le patron ne voulait pas, mais un couple en face de nous a du se lever une dizaine de fois pour fermer la deuxième porte coulissante que les client laissaient toujours ouverte. Frileux s'abstenir!  Notre repas à été de plus très décevant! La feuillantine est une sorte de feuilleté avec sauce hollandaise et jambon coupé trop épais. J'ai trouvé ça mauvais, le jambon était dur et le feuilleté détrempé. Ma copine qu'en à elle n'a pas terminé sa quiche qui contenait beaucoup de jambon en gros cubes semi-croquant.  J'éviterai ce restaurant à tout prix à l'avenir! C'est dommage puisque j'aimais bien l'ambiance parisienne, le décor typique et l'accueil festif..."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a burger. The waiter suggested the deep-fried bun -- wow. It was like having a croissant around my meat."}
{"text":"Food gets 4 stars, but you'll be so annoyed when it arrives, you'll scoff it down & leave annoyed.  The service, while friendly, was abysmal. One waitress was LITERALLY dancing around, sitting at tables, talking to everyone (who she clearly didn't know), while we waited 20+ mins to place our order, an additional 45 mins for soup, then they brought 1 sandwich & the other arrived a solid 20 minutes later. One waitress sat at the table next to us & struck up a conversation with the woman dining alone & apologized for not taking her order quicker, she'd been there maybe 6 minutes. we were separated by inches (they really squeeze you in) & waited well over 90 minutes for 2 sandwiches; nobody apologized. oh, & they brought the wrong sandwich (you'd think they'd know the difference between a croque-monsieur vs. a croque-madame,) but i wasn't about to waste another minute. in all fairness - the sandwich was really good.  My BF is the sweetest man on earth, he doesn't complain, but even he was pissed. we tried to pass it off as \"European\" but i don't care where you are, its super-annoying to watch people walk in well after us, get served, eat, pay their bill & leave -- while we were still waiting on friggin soup."}
{"text":"Très bonne soirée dans ce restaurant: une superbe ambiance musicale avec Anthony Lovison (The Voice) et un très bon repas avec des produits de qualité !!!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast/brunch places I've been to. There was no line up yet there was a steady stream of people enjoying the food. Everyone spoke English and were really nice. The food was amazing French food and at a good price! I had the brunch platter and got to try a bit of everything for only $16 and it was delicious! My friend had the apple, Brie, and ham crepe and absolutely loved it. This place has a cute French cafe feel. As an added bonus all the food came with a cup of fruit that was fresh and perfectly ripe. I highly highly recommend this place!  It's also located on one of the oldest streets in Montreal that is great for a nice scenic walk.   Ps. The mimosa was delicious and a good size too!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would. This place is an absolute abomination to restaurants in general.   Seating- Took twenty minutes to get seated with 6 tables open. No one noticed new customers?   Table service - Took another 25-30 minutes to get plates, menus, and water.   Food- Sucks. Seriously, go get some fish and chips a few blocks away that will blow your mind off.   Final thoughts - Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Average meat and cheese plate. We went in the early evening in September and there were only 2 other couples in the restaurant because they were closing in about 1.5 hours. We had the cheese and meat plate Assiette re fromages du terror for $18.95. It was an average cheese and meats plate. We would have liked a larger portion for the price with additional variety of meats and cheese."}
{"text":"Café Bistro très très très accueillant, probablement le plus sympathique qu'il m'ait été donné de découvrir. J'ai été reçu par ce cher Pierrot, Français d'origine, qui vous saluera comme si vous étiez son bon ami de toujours. Et s'il est occupé à la cuisine, un employé l'hélera de sa caisse : « Pierrot, t'as de la visite ! »... Cet homme, débordant de bonhommie contournera alors son comptoir à viandes et se pointera devant vous : « Que puis-je?! »... Hum... Eh bien...eh bien... je viens manger un bout... Alors là, il vous fera l'apologie de ses produits exposés derrière la vitrine de son comptoir : « Ça, c'est une terrine de pâtés maison, ici la mousse de foie de canard, là, y'a trois sortes de rosette de Lyon, ici les saucisses merguez, et là de Toulouse, là-bas les cretons et les viandes de charcuterie... Alors t'es décidé? »  J'ai finalement pris un sandwich à la rosette de Lyon et au fromage suisse sur pain baguette complet; franchement délectable, et je l'ai goulûment avalé dans une ambiance typiquement européenne (décoration rustique, à la fortune du pot), où j'ai à la fois pu entendre du Brel et du Aznavour dans le plafond. On les entend même pleurer et crier de l'extérieur...   L'alcool est aussi au menu : bières importées, vins (blancs et rouges), kir, cidre de pomme, cognac, etc..."}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch. Their smoke meats are great. Real authentic French deli food. Haven't had such great smoked meat since I was in Paris. They also have great wine by the glass and coffee. Love this place. Huge fan!!"}
{"text":"Had charcuterie (cold cuts) and fondues. Food was ok. Service was awful, literally all it involved was ordering and dropping off food. No quality check, no water refill. Zero service. With the many options, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Menu and atmosphere looked great but we walked out after being ignored by servers for too long (they had served people who had arrived well after us). Pure chaos in there!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the western croissant, buttery and fresh and delicious! Cronuts were great too. Would def come back!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service needs some training, all were friendly but you needed to chase for service or additional orders."}
{"text":"Endroit très sympa !!!!!!! Le foie gras bien !!!!!!, compotée oignons avec raisins ,dommage le pain pas toasté!!!!!!!  Le genre pâte viande ,la pâte pas cuite ,à peine tiède ,salade sèche très peu assaisonner,  et encore cette compotée oignons !!!!!!!!!!!    Ayant pris la formule table hôte ,plus supplément,   Ils ont zappé mon café Dommage endroit intéressant ,dans mon ressenti plutôt mitiger vers le négatif"}
{"text":"Cannot understand how someone would not like this place.  Food, 5, ambience 5, srrvice, 4......asst meat platter was exceptional.  Felt like I was in a little deli in europe.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I think I'll be coming here too often this year, took the usual , la grosse assiette , wasn't as perfect as my first time , but still was excellent .  Yelpers you guys will love their cheese and bacon .. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Went for brunch. We loved the atmosphere! The waiters were very friendly ad fun. We waited a bit longer than usual restaurant, but, considering how busy the place were, I could live with that! Their food was good, too!"}
{"text":"Lovely little place, beautiful decor, great atmosphere. My friends and I happened across it as we were exploring Old Montreal and we stopped in for brunch, and I'm so glad we did! The wait staff was very friendly and efficient. I did knock off a star because they slightly messed up my friend's order, but they dealt with it very graciously and had a new dish ready for her quickly, and offered her free bread while she waited. The food was delicious as well: authentic, fresh, and flavorful. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This quaint little Marche has a that feel of a little Paris. Random objects clutter the walls (wooden shoes, old photos, chalkboards with different eats available, etc). And faux ham and sausage links hang in the window. There is a full deli, but I went for breakfast. Saw it just walking by and popped in. Everyone was quite nice and very cheerful. We got the fruit crepes with chocolate. Very tasty. I also like that coffee was given in a mug. I drink quite a lot of it. Not the best coffee, but definitely what I needed at the time. Overall, a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We ordered croissant western breakfast and a crepe, they are pretty good taste. The service is a little slow though..."}
{"text":"Amazing marché!!! Can't get enough... Every time I'm in Montreal I can't stop coming here. From Food, drinks and service!!! Amazing people here! Thanks for the great experience every time!"}
{"text":"I took my wife here for lunch.  We were politely greeted and promptly seated.  The wait staff disappeared attending to other customers.  We finally flagged down our waiter who dished us off to another waitress.  The waiter blew kisses to my wife as an apology.  She was offended but I was not.    Every single customer who entered after us was served their meals.  When we asked what was going on we finally received our soup appetizers.  I had the Onion which was Luke warm and borderline at best.  My wife had the vegetable soup du jour.  It was cold and indescribably weird.  We could not identify any ingredients, it was more like stock than soup.  We waited AGAIN for our main courses which by the way are pre-prepared (QUICHE).  When I queried what the problem was I was given a blank stare and watched in dis belief as even more tables were receiving their food.  For the first time in my life (I am 55) I actually got up, told the waitress to cancel our order, paid for our drinks and left."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat sandwich on a crusty baguette, best we've had in a while"}
{"text":"This place is touristy to the point of self-satire and is possibly the most inauthentic dining experience I've had in the province of Quebec.  It's replete with Old Country kitsch, ranging from the plastic sides of ham hanging in the window, to the cheesy music and faux marché decor, to the surly and indifferent service (which is so jarring that it must be deliberate).  It is also the restaurant in your hometown that is well located for tourists but at which you would never eat.    I say two stars because the food was edible; the tuna salad was well presented but the vegetables had been sitting out for a while.  They overcharged us on our bill; there was a menu item at a lower price which matched a combination on the more expensive table d'hote.    Eat here if you're famished to the point of crankiness, it's Sunday, and Olive and Gourmando is closed.  C'est tout.  Montreal has so many wonderful restaurants that patronizing tourist traps like this feels like a disservice to the entire city, as well as yourself, and a waste of a perfectly good meal."}
{"text":"Arrived at around 10am on a Saturday in June and it was not very busy. Daughter 9yrs old and I ordered the crepe with nutella and banana....yummy! The husband ordered the veggie omelette with an Americano. Got busy with walking tour groups stopping in. Quaint and decorated very Parisian. Only comment for not giving a 5 star is the service, very tight seating and pricing alittle inflated for the portion served....you pay for being in a tourist part of Montreal..."}
{"text":"Found this place from just walking around.  Gazpacho was super tasty and I had the veggie sandwich and the the veggies were treated with respect! Especially surprising for such a meat-centric place.  We had a great fruit custard tart, but I would not recommend the eclairs- slightly bitter filling and not eggy at all. My partner said it was one of the best burgers he ever had."}
{"text":"Nothing like breaking yourself into the French ways with a lunch at Marche de la Villette. After being delayed at O'hare, finally getting to Montreal and checking into our hotel, this was where we went next.  We were greeted jubilantly in French when we entered this cozy, upbeat restaurant. We sat near the front at a tiny table and were handed menus (in French as well). A little uncomfortable, we ordered some local beers (similar to Blue Moon, had a white horse on it) to start. Our waiter kindly explained the food items, what's included in the fixed price lunch, and even took us to the deli window to point out options.  My husband's ham and cheese crepe was fantastic and one of our favorite food items we tasted in Montreal. I chose a sausage/sauerkraut/potatoes dish that was good. Before our plate principal, we were served vegetable soup. It was thick, almost like a puree, but very tasty.  For dessert, we got a waffle type desert (it was fun watching the woman making them) with apple and powdered sugar. Although I would have liked some chocolate with it, it was a nice way to end our meal.   We were offered a foie gras sample during our visit but declined. Waitstaff seemed happy to be working there and we were happy we stopped in."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I've had in the Old Port area. 5 adults, 2 kids, and a stroller. They gladly squeezed us in with the brunch packed Sunday crowd.  Every one of our dishes was perfect and my friends are food snobs so that says a lot!  The fondue came with a massive meat plate, the onion soup was arguably the best ever, and to top it off they have their spin on the NYC invention, the Cronut.   Our server was cheerful, helpful, and always arrived at the right moment. The vibe in this place will leave you smiling and tapping your toes along with their funny assortment of music.   This place is the opposite of most of the \"stuffy\" or \"touristy\" feeling places I've visited in this part of town."}
{"text":"A warm welcome from a cold day outside in Montreal. Comfortable, cozy, great service and affordable great food"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are incredible good, the bread the meet yum. I had the creton one, you should try it."}
{"text":"Fantastic decoration, super French atmosphere, great staff. The croque monsieur and casserole were absolutely delicious! It started getting full around 1030 so get there early if you want to avoid line ups.  Would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here. The place was pretty crowded at 5:00pm so we figured it would be good. Good burgers, escargot, and coffee. Friendly service and not too expensive. Great atmosphere with lots of cute decorations, good for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"OMG, this must be the place. Incredible French Bistro, reasonably prices and AWESOME Everything, except the 6 hour drive.  Escargot with duck fat and garlic (best ever), baked Brie with balsamic reduction and dried cranberries, onion soup with Gruyere cheese. Best food for not rich francophile foodies  in Montreal."}
{"text":"This classic French restaurant is situated in the bustling old Montreal quarter, not too far from the waterfront and the cathedral. The place had a lovely vibe to it, and a perfect spot for lunch. I was just by myself and found this place to be enjoyable. The waiter was friendly and explained the menu and I opted to go for the charcuterie- a plate of mixed smoked meats, sausage, salami and two cheeses. The taste was delicious, and the food was ample. It felt as though I was in france. I was impressed by the style and ambiance of the restaurant, the quality of the food, and the price was not bad either. Definitely will come back here next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Atmosphere was fun, upbeat, and welcoming. Very authentic French cuisine!"}
{"text":"I loved the pate's and my two boys liked the crepe from the children menu. My wife's salad had too much dressing.  Service was good."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation of a frequent visitor to Montreal, and honestly were not impressed. The food was fine but nothing stellar. I had the croque monsieur and french onion Soup, boyfriend had the prosciutto sandwich. For dessert we split the vanilla cronut which was probably the highlight food wise - so it was a shame it took an hour for our waitress to pluck it from the pastry case to get it to us. From the time she took our empty sandwich plates to the time we finally got the check was over an hour. We didn't even see her at all for 20 minutes - and it's not a big place!   If we had to do it again, we'd skip. Food was so so but the service was atrocious. Surely there are more impressive lunch spots in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The only things that are keeping me from giving it 5 stars are that they've cut down on their portions (especially the sides) and how cramped it gets inside.  The food is to die for, I make a point of coming here every time I'm in Montreal.  It's best for breakfast on off-weeekends, because it just gets too busy.  The croque madame and monsieur are worth every cent, they are so fresh.   The decor is super cozy and warm, I love the atmosphere and ambiance.    Never had anything but excellent service."}
{"text":"Marche de la Villette is an interesting old Montreal restaurant that I think is primarily a lunch place. In all events , I went for a weekday lunch.The place fills up early and gets crowded , so go early.I enjoyed the place thoroughly  but i'm not sure the food is that good.I had an escargot appetizer which was perfect.I also had cassoulet , which wasn't bad at all but was unlike any cassoulet  I've ever had.My wife had onion soup and quiche  both not bad but nothing to write home about.(The problem here may be that we make really good onion soup and on very rare  occasions my wife makes a first rate Quiche Lorraine.So on this we top most restaurants).I hate to sound critical because I like this place and don't wish to discourage anyone from going.I'd go back but I htink  you need to order strategically."}
{"text":"The soup was lovely. The main course was a Tourtière of duck (canard). Mine was served on a butcher's block with a nice salad of mixed greens and tomato and cucumber. I had a Napolean for dessert, which was also very good. Really nice experience. Low-key, cool waiters/resses, good food, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Awesome! Liked the look of this place. It is dimly lit and has a lot going on. Think trinkets, signage, and assorted condiments lining the walls, but it seems to work. Each of us got a different sandwich and shared a white sangria pitcher. The white sangria was so crisp, soothing and refreshing and I wish I could have drank more of it. The sandwiches are more than filling, although I found the bread to be a bit hard. What I liked most, though, was just being left alone. My friends and I probably spent almost two hours there and we never felt rushed or unattended. It was a good balance of just being able to relax and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible, which has convinced me this is just a tourist trap.  The food was meh, pate and duck sandwich both tasted the same but very hard bread.   The worst part is how rude the servers were, they ignored our questions and overall just a bad experience and atmosphere.   When they got our order wrong they tried to tell us we were the ones who said it wrong and didn't want to switch it for us."}
{"text":"We were going to Olive & Gourmando from across the street, but it was closed. We saw lots of diners in this restaurant and we went in. I ordered plat croque with smoked meat, which was pretty good. The story was my wife's duck pate confit, it was a disaster. The bread was old and hard, it took a good effort of jaw exercise to bite it. That's not the worst, half way through the hard work, a long hair tangled out from it. It was disgusting looking and totally knocked out our appetite. We had our waitress looked at it, she marveled \"my goodness\" and asked if we want a new one instead. We could not continue to eat after this and told her no.   The item was taken out the bill, but the experience lasted and memory of that curly blond hair sticking out from the roll ruined the day. To be fair the smoke meat croque plat was good, but the incident make you wonder what's going on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere fast service friendly.  Mix up in our order was remedied quickly and to our satisfaction.  Food selections were new to me and very good Cheese fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing special. The reason for such a low rating is the overcrowded place where you can barely walk in between the tables, it was really hot and ventilation was poor... ALL THE SMOKE FROM THE KITCHEN WAS IN THE RESTAURANT... Come here if you want your eyes to get so irritated that you start to cry."}
{"text":"This shop/deli/restaurant is a nice little place to have a bite to eat, and it has tremendous curb appeal as an old-world kind of spot. The interior, remodeled within the last couple years, is also nice and intimate. We shared the charcuterie and cheese boards, which came accompanied by a nice little salad. The items are from their house-made charcuterie, and the cheeses were a good selection, and fresh. The pates and rillettes were fantastic - the rabbit, the pork, and especially the duck. What we had was traditional and good, but I wouldn't say outstanding compared to what we've found at, say, Marche Atwater. The house red wine was just OK, the service was friendly but sporadically attentive, and the price was steep. Maybe this is more of a winter place; I remember having the French onion soup and charcuterie, among other things, during previous cold-weather visits, and loving it."}
{"text":"We were wandering around after visiting the Science Center with our 2 year old, and found this place when our intended destination was too busy. It's crowded, bustling, efficient, and kid friendly. They had a booster seat that strapped onto both the chair and the child, which was much appreciated. It has a fun, if kitschy, decor. I had the smoked meat sandwich with French fries (inside the sandwich!), my wife had the french onion soup, and my daughter had the kid's ham and cheese crepe.  My sandwich was delicious - perfectly toasted bread with lots of meat. Everything else was good too. Even my picky daughter happily ate the contents of the crepe. I recommend it for an efficient lunch break while seeing the sights."}
{"text":"this review is for the hot chocolate only:  I went here with my sister because we saw a \"juliet et chocolat\" sign in the window, and that place makes the best hot chocolate imaginable. Anyway, one small cup and $4.50 later, we had a terrible hot chocolate that was made with NESQUIK (i saw him use it from the container)!   I think this is an absolute case of false advertising- if you're going to wave the 'juliet et chocolat' sign, then you've sorta got a reputation to uphold. definitely not returning for anything else; if they cut corners on something as cheap and straight-forward as hot chocolate, i don't even want to consider any other cost-saving shortcuts they take with their food."}
{"text":"Really surprised with the overall average rating. Everything about this place was great. Awesome food and drinks, chill atmosphere and great service.  This place is the perfect brunch spot. They have a large variety of breakfast casseroles, delicious 7-8in baguette sandwiches, and some great breakfast platters. I had one of their breakfast casseroles (eggs, potatoes, mixed sausages and cheese). OMG, what a fantastic fully balanced dish. It lacked nothing. My boyfriend had one of their breakfast baguettes, complete with lettuce and tomatoes - which at first I found weird. But it gave the sandwich such a refreshing taste. The baguette was huge with crispy exterior and soft interior.  The mimosas were tasty and had a slightly different OJ but in a very good way. We took a caramel cronut to go and it was THE BOMB DOT COM. Flaky, sweet, tasty - perfection.   Service was fantastic. I'll definitely be returning when in town."}
{"text":"Two of us stopped here for lunch. Lots of fake decor inside, and obviously catering to the tourist community (plastic jamons in the window, for example). We ordered a homemade pate sandwich, which they were out of. We happily switched to the duck liver sandwich. It was large, served on a baguette. Other menu items seemed over priced, and there was nothing unique on the menu. Overall, a good place to escape the cold and fill up if you don't have anywhere else to be. The sandwich was quite good and satisfying."}
{"text":"Food : Overpriced for what you're paying for. Under-seasoned, too.  Service : The waiter(s) I had was especially rude. There was an older gentlemen that was trying to be very friendly, but he was ultimately super annoying. Stalled a lot, wouldn't take our order right away (it was a work lunch). Treated with a lot of disrespect all-in-all which left a bad after taste."}
{"text":"This cute French cafe has a great interior. I liked the decor and its old world character. Plus, the one employee working behind the counter was super accommodating when I asked him to make me a sandwich for my ride home (even though the business hadn't officially opened yet).  However, would it have killed him to add a couple more slices of meat? I mean, my baguette was great, my brie cheese was great, but together they couldn't save my sandwich from the two pathetic slices of ham. Even the skinniest Frenchman would have cried, \"C'est terrible!\"  Yet I'd probably return again because the character of the place and the very nice employee made up for my sparsely-packed ham sandwich."}
{"text":"Perfect for what they do.  Service people were personable and well informed.  You could tell they we're proud of the product.  Great authentic French food."}
{"text":"I really wanted O + G, but there was a line and we were way too hungry to wait.  This restaurant was fairly busy and how can you go wrong with a place that has tons of meats in the window???  We decided to do the table d'hote since the price seemed pretty reasonable and we were pretty hungry.  The soup way okay and the entrees were fine.  I'll warn  you that everything including ham/bacon seems to be topped off with maple syrup.  The food was fine, nothing out of world but a-ok.  This is where things dropped off.  They had two waiters working the floor and that didn't seem to be enough.  We ate our entrees and then waited a good 20 min or so before the waiter came back and asked if we wanted the dessert course and we said yes.  Then the two ugliest nastiest ladies came in and sat at the table next to us.  They wanted to custom order EVERYTHING!  It was pretty clear to us that NOTHING would make these miserable women happy yet the waiter was going to try.  45 minutes later still no desert or any service - I guess we weren't important at all so we had to walk up to the front of the restaurant and get our bill.  They didn't understand that we were done waiting at that point (our time does have value) and weren't willing to make any adjustments for the fact that we didn't get our full meal.  Not in the mood for dessert and coffee after waiting over an hour (and yes we did start timing them).  In addition to service that went from ok to non existent the drinks at this place are ridiculous in price - it's clear that they make their  money off the beers."}
{"text":"Truly mediocre! We stumbled in for an early dinner as this was one of the few places open on a Sunday night at 5. The food and the service were indifferent and unmemorable her expensive.   I would not recommend this place if one has other choices. However, we ended up less hungry than when we entered and that was, in fact, the objective.   In sum, if you can avoid this place, do."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for a late lunch and thoroughly enjoyed our entire experience.  We shared the fondue for two which is accompanied by a charcuterie platter. The fondue was very tasty and the meat platter was a nice touch.  This was more than enough for the two of us.  The price for the fondue seemed somewhat high but was well worth it.  The rest of the menu was priced affordably.   The atmosphere of this small restaurant is quite unique with a strong European feel.  Our service was excellent, especially our waiter who was quite the character.  We will definitely return here and highly recommend this location for breakfast, brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. I mean we ordered cold cuts, a sandwich and French onion soup. Pretty good atmosphere but it is a little pricey. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Is there a rating lower than 1? Can I give it zero?   Without a doubt, the service here was the worst I had ever experienced. Comically so! I wondered if I was in an episode of \"just for laughs\" and on camera.  Sadly, not.   The prices were ridiculous for the quality (do you like to pay 5 star prices for food court food... Then maybe this is your place). And the service  made me long for the consistent banality of Swiss Chalet or similar.   Where to begin? Amongst other things:  - arrived for brunch at 11. Reservation was made for a party of 8. We were seated at a table for 6. And given 2 menus. A request for additional menus yielded one more. Three menus for 8 people.  - our coffees arrived about half an hour after we were seated (and had asked for coffee). No milk, cream, sugar or spoons, just coffee. Requested same. And asked passing waiters for \"du lait et de sucre\". Response was a rude \"it's coming \". And it did, 20 minutes later our waiter threw two milk capsules on the table. One was empty. We asked again for spoons and sugar and he returned with one spoon for the table to share, and a snarky \"your spoon, madam\", as if it was a ridiculous ask. The spoon was a tablespoon.   The first two meals arrived, followed by the next 3 or 4 each 5 minutes apart.. We had been there more than an hour.  Oh, did I mention that no cutlery came with the meals? When I finally went to the front counter to ask for forks, I was met with a very  rude \"please remain seated\". The cutlery arrived almost half an hour after the first meal was served.   There are too many things to mention... My friend had ordered a basket of baguette with \"assorted confitures\" (homemade jams and jellies). She received a dry piece of bread.. no jam (or knife, but why be picky, nothing to spread anyhow). The waiters response, again 30 minutes late, was \"I think we are out of jam\"... She said okay, but I don't think I should have to pay for it. He swiftly removed the bread, lest she try to get any actual nourishment.  The response to our complaints was an unapologetic - we are very busy.  The waiter did, eventually offer to waive the price of 2 coffees.  I should note that we are not tourists, we are French speakers, half of our party lives n old montreal. I guess tourists who could never return are the target demographic.    PS - we never did get the round of waters that we ordered as we sat down...but you already figured that, right?"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic, food is always absolutely delicious, and the staff is always friendly... Definitely a hidden gem in the city"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, unique atmosphere and delicious French food will complete your Montreal experience. We had an incredible French onion soup for as low as $8 and huge meat platter for $18. The latter is big enough for 2 or 3 people to share. My boyfriend usually does not eat pate, but this time I couldn't stop him :) totally recommend this place for a lunch!"}
{"text":"Yeah...this place was pretty much awesome. You walk in, and almost feel like you are transported to Europe. It's got the busy cafe vibe, tons of different languages being spoken, lots of bread, meat and cheese splayed out on a table, and delicious wine to complement it.  I could've spent my whole day here eating through the menu and washing it down with some wine.  If you walk around Old Montreal...DEFINITELY stop by and have a meal and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch... Terrible service... We ordered 2 French onion soup, quiche and ham and cheese crepe...   We waited for an hour... Only the onion soup came... We were really frustrated... The server was rude and didn't seem to care... Maybe its cause I'm chinese...  The soup was ok... Not great... They used    mozzarella cheese  not Swiss.... The soup cost 18.95... Not worth the price.... Never going back... Will never recommend anyone to come to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Really great little place. Went for lunch across the street and sat in the window and saw this little sign about cronuts. Never had one untill today it was delicious.  Had a nice server I will be coming back Forsure."}
{"text":"Very rustic interior, takes you back to the small bistros in the suburbs of Paris. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and service is always fast. The food is exceedingly well, and the flavor and taste are top notch. Their sandwiches can not be beat in Montreal, the quality of their meats and cheeses as well as their seafood is above anyone else in the area."}
{"text":"Typiquement Français dans un décor rustique Québécois, j'adore l'ambiance! Le  personnel est très sympatique et soucieux de nous plaire. Grand choix à base de viande mais un seul sandwich végétalien et une quiche végétarienne au menu. Les pâtisseries sont fameuses. La qualité supérieure des mets et la fraîcheur des aliments m'emballe. Une ou deux innovations végétaliennes à ajouter au menu et je craquerais pour une cinquième étoile."}
{"text":"Super cute old restaurant and deli. Loved our vivacious hostess and the hot, fresh food on a cold winter's day. It's down to earth and serves up great food with old style and a vintage Paris feel."}
{"text":"Errrrmaaaaghhhherd. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200 (canadian) dollars. Just get the charcuterie. I can't be responsible for what happens after that.   We stopped in this little spot because sommmmeone (me) has a teeny bladder. Also, because it was a butcher shop and my BF is obsessed with meat. While i ran into the bathroom at warp speed, he ordered us a beverage and the charcuterie plate. What arrived stunned me. It wasn't a plate - it was a platter. A platter full of the most amazing meats ever.   Foie Gras that was so buttery and incredible I can scarcely believe it. That was just the tip of the iceberg/mountain of meat. Two kinds of pate, proscuitto, pancetta, a shreddy thing, roast beef, salami, some other meat spread I couldn't identify but immediately ate and cornichones and mustard of course.  In the end, one of the servers promoted this ice wine to us. His claims were spot on about how complementary it was... but at $20 a glass, we felt a little cheated. That's pricey even for Montreal and it seems like something he should have mentioned. A good stop in experience for us based on the charcuterie plate alone. Skip the ice wine. It's nice - but not that nice."}
{"text":"it was quite the festive atmoshere with the world cup on big screen but the staff were quite snobby bitches. I wanted to smack one of them at one point as they were quite rude to my mom. I ordered their brie sandwich which I specifically asked for them to heat up and I guess their frentch isn't all that good cause I mentioned to them en francais....the owner was a total prick. Otherwise was just an ok experience. I won't be going back again in the future though"}
{"text":"Food was not too bad. Could have been a little warmer. The service was what earns this place a 1 star review. I wont write an essay since ill be echoing the bad reviews on here, just please avoid this place. The staff is lost, confused, rude, incompetent and the waiter with the curled up mustache is a pissy little person and was giving us attitude after we were overcharged because of their mistake. Definition of a tourist trap."}
{"text":"This was our family's first trip to Montrial. We were all attending a funeral.   I wanted to take my group which included (daughter and sons of the deceased) for a breakfast before the long day started... Looked at yelp reviews and I figured this was one of the highest rated restaurants in the area... we were one of the first guests to come here that morning...   from the moment we sat here, the server started treating our group of 6 people like rubbish.... we asked for plain water and salt... he said we are too demanding.. . ended up ordering our food anyway.. as we had already seen worse on the death of our loved one... . my aunt dropped her folk so she asked for another one... and the server was again frowning and murmering words inside his mouth... most of us didn't end up eating anything... and left our food in the plates... when we were ready for the check the server asked if we would like to eat the remaining papers and trash or should he clean up.??? (what a racist ...)   I told him \"thanks, may be you will like it.\" and asked for the check... he asked my aunt to come back in the kitchen with him so she can help clean up the utensils...   I wish their was a way to give negative 10,000 score on yelp. I would have given it."}
{"text":"Nice brunch spot in Old Montreal. Went here with a friend and we both ordered the Super Assiette which is really indeed super in terms of size and taste. We were both handed a plate with lots of fruit (cantaloupe/honeydew/pineapple/strawberries), generous amount of salad, deli meat, bacon, Alsacian style omelete, 3 small pieces of baguette, crazy good cheese (though I don't know what kind but man it was really good quality cheese), and of course I had my coffee.   Now I recommend the super assiette if you're coming on a complete empty stomach and have not yet eaten a breakfast or anything at all. It is really filling but I took my time of course, talking a lot while throwing in bites here and there. The service was quite fast , and the waitress was very patient to have brought us 3 things that we wanted extra...like more baguette, more dressing and more coffee. I liked the decor of the place. Ambiance was warm and cozy. I also particulary liked the fact that it was not only a restaurant but a fromagerie and a boucherie. I was highly tempted to buy the same cheese that was served on my dish and bring it home....but alas I didn't.  If you're looking for something different for brunch and you are in the old port area, visit Marche de la Villette. They have so many different options to try like croque monsieurs etc."}
{"text":"On my way to the archeology museum today, I got a little lost in an area on Rue St. Paul, but fortuitously as it turned out. If I hadn't been off the beaten path, I probably wouldn't have passed La Villette.  What struck me immediately in passing was the framed Bon Appetit magazine article--oh, and the word \"charcuterie\" emblazoned across the window. ;)  I made my way back after the museum and decided on the Assiette La Villette, an array of cheese, pates, and a small salad. As I waited for my food, I soaked in the atmosphere. The tables were small and close together, and there was French music playing. Perhaps it was just me, but the decor seemed a bit over the top, like a Disney version of a French cafe, but the food and service were wonderful.  When my lunch was served, the platter was covered with a selection of pate de foie gras, a country-style duck pate, duck rillettes, a pate of pork and veal, prosciutto, ham, salami, a small crock of mustard, some cornichons, brie, two local cheeses, and a small green salad. This also came with a small basket of bread. It sounds like a lot of food--and it was. And it was utterly delicious.  I couldn't stop eating the pate de foie gras and the duck rillettes, as well as everything else. The country-style duck pate was my next favorite, with a bit of mustard. The pork and veal pate was my least favorite. In all, I ate far more than I should have, and had a memorably lovely lunch at La Villette.  Thank goodness I wasn't with my vegetarian coworkers!"}
{"text":"Amazing little hidden gem. Sandwiches and sangria hit the spot on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Small crowded place and noisy but loads of fun. The waiter was being funny to all of us and I thought at one point we would all break out singing.  I had the Croque Monsier and it was amazing. Why can't the USA get ham and cheese like this?    The salad on the side was really good too.  Originally we were headed to Olive and Gourmondeau across the street but the line was too long and I wasn't dissappointed to land here.  Try it."}
{"text":"I am generous on reviews, I really am. I wish I could give it more stars, but it was my first time in Montreal and I wasn't too impressed.  Pros: 1. Nice location and ambience, though tables are too close. 2. English-friendly servers 3. Good local beers and whatever my friend ordered was quite tasty  Cons: 1. Waiters ignored our table for some god-forsaken reason. Be it the first drinks, the food or the check. We almost ran over parking limit and had to cut down on our itinerary for the day. 2. The famed Smoked meat sandwich - good meat, but the wasabi-sauce was so strong, it brought water to my eyes on every single bite. And this comes from an Indian. I haven't had one before, are they supposed to be that way?"}
{"text":"Come here for: cozy afternoon snacks (sandwiches, cheese, soup, impromptu dessert, less impromptu glass of wine). This place will give you a warm feeling inside but isn't a wow spot  Food: solid! We had the cheese fondue which was primarily Swiss cheese and delightful, exactly as you would expect. We also had the brownie and eclair which were ok, but I think you can get better at neighboring spots. One downside was that they were out of quite a few desserts Ambience: nicely dim lit, warm, wooden, classic butcher window in the front if you need to look at what you're ordering before you order. There was a solid mix of families, couples, and friends Service: staff has a great sense of humor and loves to joke with the customers, they're very helpful with the menu"}
{"text":"Our last lunch in Montreal was at Marche De La Villette, a decision sparked mainly by the appearance of meat and meat models hanging in the window and the sounds of accordion music escaping past the door.   The place seemed more French than the French themselves and that's quite all right--- given the quality of the lunch we had, Marche could equip their wait staff in mime costumes, blast Maurice Chevalier all day and force us to listen to the speeches of Degaulle all day and I'd still eat here.  For $14.95, you'll receive a soup, a plat principal and dessert as part of their lunch special. My wife opted for this and was quite satisfied with her choice of the choucroute (sausage, potatoes and sauerkraut-- how Alsatian!) The dessert was two mini waffles with powdered sugar that I brazenly stole.  I was far more gluttonous and ordered a charcuterie plate and a croque monsieur.   Served on a board, the charcuterie offered up delicious samples of brie, cheddar, sausage, turkey cold cut, chicken salad, pate and more.   There was barely enough room on our table when my croque monsieur arrived, now with bacon strips! Yes, ham and cheese alone just isn't meaty enough so the addition of bacon strips is surely welcome.  While the menu is en francais, the staff was quite willing to explain certain dishes, especially in areas where my french is severely lacking. (Like names of specific vegetables)  The staff was definitely harried. Somehow the lunch service was harmonious, our waitress was apologetic about being late with our water refills and it all came together.   The menu includes hamburgers, sandwiches and salads. Prices in that area, for lunch, start at $9.95."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast or lunch. Charming French cafe! Service was fast , pastries, sandwiches, mimosa and coffee was excellent"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the French atmosphere and the decor inside this place. It feels like we were really in Europe. We actually came to this place because the wait at Olive and Gourmando, which was diagonally across the street, was said to be almost an hour. I didn't regret our choice in coming here because the food is nice, the place is lovely and there was no wait then.   We had: Cassolette Alsacienne, omelette Savoyarde and croissant Western. The Cassolette was a bit bland. The omelette had pretty strong taste of the cheeses used (if you like cheese, this is a good one). And the western croissant was very nice - the omelet was fluffy and yummy! Finally the cannelés were lovely! Light and perfect to end the meal. I'd go back and try their meat and cheese platters, as well as their sangria (in tall glasses) - they look very enticing :) . The service was all right."}
{"text":"I think the 3.5 star rating for this place is pretty accurate. We only ordered the Alsace cassoulet and pastries, all of which were excellent. Service was friendly and attentive. The inside is very cute and the tables by the large windows are great for people watching. I would have given this place four stars, but there are two main reasons why I can only give it three: each cup of coffee is $3 - there are no refills. Really? No wonder this place was empty and the place across the street was packed! The prices are a little high, which definitely makes this place feel like a tourist trap. Our brunch for two with no alcohol was almost $80 with tip."}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars, overall this place is good, the only thing is the food was slightly bland and with a bit of salt and pepper it was perfect! Same can be said about the cappuccino and macchiato, just a bit better quality coffee and hot chocolate mix it would have been spot on. Atmosphere service was great! Also need to replace the shakers with ground pepper and rock salt!"}
{"text":"I was all set to have dinner at La Bourlingueur when we walked past this place and saw the window seats lined with folks diving into their Soup a l'oignon and charcuterie platters and knew that this was the place to check out.  The restaurant is delightfully decorated and plays stereotypically French music - I almost expect Rene Artois from Allo Allo to jump out at any moment to offer me some wine.    The decorations were nicer than the food, although the charcuterie platter was quite good.  A nice assortment of meats and the bread was fresh and crusty.  The cassoulet was basically a dish of sausage and sauerkraut, and was probably less traditionally prepared than we had expected.  The French onion soup had a nice crunchy cheesy top, but the soup itself was barely warm - it would have been much better if the entire dish was piping hot.    So I'd give 3/5 for the food, but the atmosphere was terrific 4/5, so I can bump this one up a star to 4/5 overall for the experience and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Very nice waitress Charlie. Great ambience. Dessert are homemade and fantastic. We had wine and meat platter to nibble."}
{"text":"Pourquoi j'adore ce resto? Pour une raison toute simple, c'est qu'il me rappelle les petits PMU de province pas loin de chez moi. L'ambiance, c'est tout à fait ça : la poussière sur les anciennes bouteilles de bon pinard et les pichets Ricard. Et puis ils font aussi du bon sauciflard et des rillettes de canard! Ouaip, ça sent bon la maison tout ça! Allez le seul bémol pour moi c'est la taille des steaks dans les hamburgers : beaucoup trop haut pour ma pauvre petite bouche et bien trop gros pour mon appétit de Tite! Sinon, pour tout le reste, y'a bon!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this was the worst service I've had in Montreal. 20 minutes to have a bus boy take my oder. Didn't speak to my waitress the food started to arrive. No apologies.  There is no mistaking this is tourist food. We are now chasing out waitress down to pay. This has been a great disappointment."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch, not crowded at all on a weekday.  Our omelets came on a small cutting board and were delicious.  For tourists, but not touristy.  We would come back."}
{"text":"This isn't anything like Montreal's famous Schwartz's, or any other typical Jewish deli that you may be familiar with. This is a traditional Quebecois delicatessen that specializes in traditional terrine (country pate) and local cheese.  It's very much like a French Bistro, the tables are close together and when it's busy, it's crazed! If you listen carefully you'll find that it's quite popular amongst locals. Be kind to your server, as they can only have a handful on shift and with the constant turn over, they're all quite busy. They always do their best, are friendly and if you engage them, full of personality!  One of us has an obsession with their assorted meat platter which allows you to taste their many cold cuts and pates. If you have this plate, spend the extra $15 and get the foie gras pate - possibly the best out there (and we've had a lot). Our last visit saw us tip over the edge of indulgence, like the good food whores we are, when we ordered their assorted cheese platter along with the meat. They came on two wooden cutting boards with a basket of cut up baguette, and they leave you to your imagination to mix the flavours.  The meat assortment includes: rabbit terrine, pork terrine, liver terrine, ham, turkey, salami, roast beef and of course we included the foie gras. The roast beef feels like it's carved fresh off a giant hunk of meat in the back, we could have rubbed our faces in it. The salami was perfectly balanced with fat and spices. The infamous foie gras pate was buttery melt in your mouth deliciousness. Top it with a slice of strawberry and let your taste buds rejoice.  The cheese platter included a creamy brie, a local St. Andre Chevre (oozy creamy goodness), a Quebecois swiss and an unidentified, but wonderful, gouda-like cheese.  Have fun mixing and matching the cheeses and the meats with the sides of spicy mustered, pickles, fig chutney and strawberry.  Ordering both the cheese and meat assorted platters is only for the brave of heart. We are true food whores, and even we couldn't eat seven hours later. But our attempt clearly made us famous with the staff as they remembered both of us the next day. This is likely something normally shared with groups of four.  Do order a glass of red wine (we had two each, the gluttons that we are), served perfectly at European room temperature - you won't regret it.  If you can still stand it, do have the coffee. It's fantastic, almost nutty, rich, thick and strong. If you like cream, ask for extra - you'll need it. For those who travel, this shall not be unfamiliar as it's quite typical in Europe."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast as Olive Et Gourmando had a line out the door. What a pleasure it was. Service could improve a little but food was quick out and delicious"}
{"text":"We have been going to Montreal for the past 10 years.  We always stop here as soon as we can.  The salmon baguette is so fresh and delicious.  We get a plate of meats and cheeses that we can never finish.  My daughter has been coming with us since she was one.  They have always been so sweet to her.  They even fit in our huge stroller when we had one.  THe main guy is funny and kind. It was super fun during the World Cup last year.  It's a casual little spot with lots of people in and out. If you are use to traveling and like an \"experience\" then go here.  If you prefer restaurants like The Olive Garden and ever eat Fast Food then stay away."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and got bunch of food. The plate to share and tortierre for myself.  It was delicious and highly recommended.  Food: 4.5/5, delicious tortierre (Quebec meat pie) with duck with salad. The meat plate with pate, cheese, bread were really good. Their cronuts were also amazing with caramel and custard   Service: 3/5, our waiter was really nice but one of my friends got his food way late because they gave it to another person.  Ambience: 4/5, awesome French music with very nice rustic decor.   Price: 4/5, not pricy at all. Around $30/person after you get appetizers, main and drinks.."}
{"text":"Aunque la comida estaba buena, el servicio fue pésimo. A parte de tener q pedir agua hasta 3 veces para q la trajeran, apuntaron una sopa en vez de dos, así q comimos el primero por separado. El camarero era demasiado graciosillo, hasta el punto de ser desagradable."}
{"text":"Deli-style with additional interesting french menu items. Excellent escargot. Great atmosphere. Could be a little more organized."}
{"text":"Our second day in Montreal we wanted to try something different for breakfast.  Meaning, not a chain, and not just pastries and coffee/tea.  We had spied this place the other day and it looked intriguing, although the menu out front wasn't totally clear, the sign saying \"breakfast served all day\" was pretty clear.    We were there at 9:40.  Took about 10 minutes to get anyone to notice us in the empty and freezing shop.  We were told the kitchen doesn't open until 10 (this was a weekday!).  No suggestion to sit and wait with some espresso, no offer to look at the menu.  Not a good start.  We went next door and got a drink (a missed sale! empolyees of Marche).  I convinced my dinning partner to come back and try again.  Probably was a bad idea.  What I had was good.  Let me say that first off.  The service was not up to snuff but as long as it isn't horrible I can usually handle that.  Waiting for the cook to get to work was a bit of a trial, about 40 minutes.  The people next to us ordered croque monsieur and waited nearly an hour while the staff filled the deli case instead of making their meal.  When they complained a manager type made them in about 30 seconds.  hmmmmm... another bad sign!  I tried the omelet special, which was more of soufflé.  I'm not an omelet conisure but it was nice.  The ham, bacon, cheese, paté, fruit and bread was all good and really more than I typically have for breakfast but a nice treat.  What wasn't good was putting a salad on top of all of that on a warm plate next to the piping hot dish that held the omelet/souffle thing.  Which creates  a  wilted salad as anyone will tell you.  But here is the kicker, my companion ordered the fruit crepe.  It came out looking like a burrito, which is not the end of the world and could be interesting.  While it was filled with fresh fruit, most of that fruit hadn't been properly cleaned.  The cantaloupe still had the rind on it!  And the crepe was chrispy like it had been fried or something.  I have no idea how you do that to a crepe.  Maybe this is a regional variation I'm not aware of but when you got to hack at your crepe with a chisel to get at hard cantaloupe rind something is not Kosher.    Like the hair that was served with the crepe.    I wanted this place to be better.  It is cute and interesting and I wanted to sample all the things in their deli case.  But I'm not coming back for $15 a person breakfast that isn't served until lunch and isn't properly prepared.  Should have gotten pastries at Olive+Gourmando."}
{"text":"\"I love to travel\" - yawn, generic, everybody says that, who doesn't like to travel. . .  Ok, tough crowd, let me tell you how I like to travel.  I like to stay at small bed and breakfasts, preferably with my own fireplace.  I like to talk to the ppl of the B&B while I break my fast on recommendations of places to go.  Where should I eat, what should I see. . . And that is how I found Marche De La Villette.   My girl and I were staying at a cute B&B in Old Montreal and asked where should we go for lunch and we were directed here.  A cute and crowded cafe that was quaint, warm and welcoming.    - Perfect quiche lorraine, warm, piping, inviting.   - Perfect French onion soup, well rounded flavors with just the right amount of cheese.  Not too much papa bear, not too little mama bear.  Even though I was stuffed to the point of uncomfortable reflux, I could not help asking to look at the menu again. I. WANT. MORE.  What else can I try?!?!  My friend had to reason my gluttony down and promise that we would return again before we left Montreal.  And we did, the last day, I ran to grab take out as our limo was waiting to take us to the airport. . .   And that is how I like to travel :-)"}
{"text":"This place drew us in due to the cuteness of the decor and Parisian music. We did not have to wait long. The service was excellent! We ordered drinks - white sangria and beer. We had a large breakfast  so we only wanted to get the french staples! We ordered the escargot and a mixed meats and cheese plate.  Escargot- $9 highly recommend one of the best we ever had! So cheesy and lots of delicious garlic oil with parsley.   Meats + cheese plate - we added foie gras so it was about $30! Wonderful we could not finished and took it to go and has it as snack later with some wine in our hotel room!  This can very well look like a tourist trap as it is in old Montréal.  However we found ourselves enjoying our time here and really taking in the French Canadian cuisine.  We were seated close to the back area. The only thing that bothered me was my eyes due to the smoke so the ventilation needs to be better."}
{"text":"Cute little French place.  Feels authentic.   MUST try the Nutella, banana, mixed berry crepe. Served warm... melts in your mouth.   Eggs are wonderful too."}
{"text":"OMG where do I start? Let's jump into this just looking at the food; 5 out of 5! Every aspect of our meal was perfect, fresh, and French! I got the bacon omelette, which had so much bacon I was in heaven.   The quality of their food is amazing and the service was extremely friendly. There was a hipster guy who checked up on us a few times and made multiple jokes. The surroundings is very intimate, but still family friendly.   I'd strongly recommend to families, dates, and anytime of the day! I'll be back before my trip is finished!!!!"}
{"text":"Tourists beware.  My wife and I ordered sandwich, crepe and 1/2 liter of horrible house rose wine for lunch and were charged $86.  The waitress pushed the 1/2 liter when we wanted 2 glasses saying it would be cheaper (glasses were $8.95, 1/2 liter has ~3 glasses and we were charged $40 for 1/2 liter - their full bottle wines are $39).  when Michael (? think name is correct, he had a very unique moustache) realized I was from US he switched from cash register to calculator and came up with crazy price - when I asked for itemized receipt he claimed that their \"system was down\".    Service was less than adequate - as indicated in other reviews.  Our son went to university in Montreal - ate at lots of good places in Montreal during the 4.5 years - if you're visiting, try somewhere else.  If you decide to risk it here ask for itemized price and itemized receipt for everything."}
{"text":"The perfect lunch spot during our family vacation to Montreal. I ordered the French salami sandwich, which was good. The bread was fresh. However, my brother ordered the Croque Madame which I would definitely recommend. The French Onion soup was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the second time when I was in Montreal in August. I went for the first time in October after hearing marvelous things about the charcuterie (I was on a charcuterie kick at the time). My friend, Jason and I split the charcuterie plate with foie gras as well as a cheese plate (large portions--we had left overs). We both loved it! This time when I came, I got the charcuterie plate and a cronut (caramel). The charcuterie plate had changed a bit-- a couple items were replaced with new things. There was one \"deli\" style meat that I was now a fan of. Other than that I loved everything! There was a new ginger bread that they served with the foie grad that I was obsessed with. The combination was perfect! I also thoroughly enjoyed my cronut. They were a trend in the states for a bit, but sort of died out, so when I saw them on the menu, I knew I had to get one. It did not disappoint. The one negative thing I have to say is that the service did not seem to be super great/consistent. My service personally was fine, but there were people who came in after me and were made to wait before even being greeted by a hostess (they stood awkwardly in the doorway for 10 minutes with only 5-6 of the tables in the restaurant being occupied). The restaurant itself is cute and quaint and I'll definitely be back for my charcuterie next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"If you want to go to a good French restaurant just DONT GO there  It is just not a French restaurant  The food is not well cooked, it is served in plastic plates... We had the Gainsbourg burger and the \"cassoulet\" with duck which was like a can food!! They shouldn't even call it cassoulet   The waiters are sooo kind but it is just a shame to serve this kind of food"}
{"text":"The interiors has a very rustic French feel It felt like the movie ratatouille hehe The staff is very attentive and nice I ordered the charcuterie platter and this is enough for two! Served w French bread and lots of butter (on the side) The meats were a conglomeration of different sorts I am not sure what to call some of them It.s not aspic but it.s compressed meat but it is not ham like...very savory There was a spicy sopressatta, salami, corned beef, roast beef, pâté, Brie, fruits and a small salad on the side, and cornichons It was a delightful breakfast Also got the veggie soup which was a pure of citrusy goodness They also sell the meats, homemade sausages, PIES sweet ones and savory ones... A fun spot for breakfast lunch considering that most places open after 5p For the plate above cost was $16 worth it!"}
{"text":"A charming French cafe for lunch or brunch - get the Gruyere  I passed by this charming cafe early one morning while walking around Montreal's old port and after taking a look at the menu made a point of returning. I had intended to order the Cassolette Alsacienne which sounded delicious - a fried egg over potatoes, swiss cheese, mixed sausages, bacon, and shallots. And looking around the restaurant I saw a number of people happily eating theirs. But at the last minute I saw a crepe covered in ham with Gruyere oozing out of it and got it instead....and it was delicious. The crepe also came with a small bowl of fruit which was nice. If you are here for dinner the taste of the cheese and the scent of the hanging meats would suggest that the raclette, fondue, and charcuterie would be good choices. However I would avoid the cappuccino - it was flavorless, expensive, and covered in chocolate powder.  The service was a bit haphazard though well meaning. The decor was quite charming. And the location on rue St Paul ensures a constant flow of potential customers."}
{"text":"Excellent charcuterie board for lunch filled with the most delicious ham, roast beef and salamie! I only wish there were more cheese on the board, but since we got the foie gras I think we missed out on more cheese options. Never the less, it was delicious! Service was also really great. Would definitely be a regular if I lived in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Place was ok. Too authentic for me. I don't eat pork and don't mix dairy and meat so it was hard to find anything that works for me on the menu. We walked in when the game was on and it was hard to hear... The waiter couldn't hear me and it was hard to ask for something on the menu that would work for me.  We came in to watch the game and were able to do that. I ended up getting a Brie sandwich. It was decent with lots of cheese and bread. They mixed in some mustard into it with pickles, tomatoes and lettuce and made it interesting.  Once the game was over, a guy with an accordion swooped in. That was nice. Sangria was overpriced given quantity. Fun place but service was slow and menu limited"}
{"text":"I found this place while wandering around town. They weren't super busy, and they had eye catching decor. The wait staff were courteous and attentive without being overly hovering. Their menu isn't huge, but I got the impression that all of the items on it were carefully thought out and that there was a little something for everyone. I wound up getting crepes with ham, green apple, and brie. It came with a lovely little side salad, and all of the food was faintly sweet in flavor. Very good."}
{"text":"Cute spot which was one of the very few restaurants that was open early on a rainy weekend!  I got their huge mug of hot chocolate, as well as the croissant.  My boo got the omelet which came with some pate.    Food was good, everything was decorated in a nice way!"}
{"text":"We had a late breakfast here the other day and were not disappointed having passed it over the previous few days fully packed.  We both had the western croissant which was a great open faced sandwich with bacon, cheese, egg and a croissant.    They couldnt make a nonfat coffee drink unfortunately so if you are looking for a skinny latte this isnt the place.  But it was a quick and tasty breakfast"}
{"text":"Such a fun and quaint little place!  Everything they serve is delicious. They even serve pickles and mustard with your charcuterie like they do in France!  The pate was delicious!  Service is the same as everywhere else in the city, fair, but the ambiance definitely makes it worth going!"}
{"text":"The place is decorated in a low budget fake plastic french stuff! The food was not good at all!   Service was too much in a hurry!  The waiter never brought my wifes capuccino.  And a the worst thing was a ridiculous long standing line to pay your bill! And they do not accept American Express. Never again!"}
{"text":"We came here because our original restaurant choice was on overflow. Glad we did. Right between sts Peter and Paul. The omelets were huge and my crepe with Brie (but of course) with ham and apple. Lovely. Then after we are done our waiter brings us 2 pieces of grilled pineapple. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost.  I would honestly give this place a NEGATIVE 5 stars after the experience I just had there.  First, my wife is a vegan, and I'm quite used to asking for her food to contain no meat and no dairy (milk products).  She asked for a Vegetarian sandwich, she asked for no cheese on the sandwich, as did I.  I ordered a smoked meat sandwich.  The atmosphere seemed quite bubbly and happy which was nice, but that's where 'nice' ended.  First of all the toilet that rocks side to side as you sit on it, not cute, and the fact that the cleaning products were hanging all around in the bathroom, also not cute.  The bathroom wasn't this way 'by accident' they actually wanted it to have a 'rustic' feel, and did they ever succeed, I was almost afraid to flush the toilet and when I leaned over to do so, I accidentally turned on what turned out to be the hand dryer behind me, with my butt.  This is Canada, and not some back-water shed city, this apparently was missed by whomever decorated this place and maintains it.  Back to the food, I returned from the washroom to find the food on our table and my wife asking if there was cheese on her sandwich.  I saw some creamy white stuff and thought, ugh probably mayo (my fault, I failed to ensure there would be none).  Nope, I tried it and it was a melted cheese and mayo mixture, along with some sour cream.  I like to cook and I've become quite used to tasting what I cook, I know cheese when I taste it.  I informed our server, to which he responded \"no no, there is no cheese, show me the cheese\".  He then proceeded after I was ABOUT to show him the cheese to go and get a SECOND staff member, whom also asked me to 'show him the cheese', he then walked over to the counter, back again, and AGAIN insisted there was no cheese.  I went to go to the counter to express how absolutely furious I was that they would even think to play this game with me, at which point he walked right by me, and someone else went to go harass my wife.  I went back to the table, my wife by that point was extremely embarrassed by the whole scene this had become (might I add we now had 2 servers AND the 'sandwich guy' at our table, all declaring no no its not cheese), that she said its fine, we asked for our bill, paid, and promptly left.  I'd also like to add, the deli, while they have many 'fresh' meats on display, is quite clearly store bought.  The meat was completely dried out, not smoked, but completely bone dry, the 'dijon' mustard had absolutely no spice to it and may as well have been a no name brand store bought variety.  Not only will I never visit this place again, but if I can save another poor soul from enduring this 'restaurant', my life will feel that much more complete."}
{"text":"I love Montreal.  I love Montreal on a Sunday.  I love Montreal in Winter. I DO NOT love how Montreal thinks its ok to have half your restaurants close on Sundays. But Marche de la Villette was super redeeming as we ordered coffee, onion soup, crepes, and sandwiches, all which arrived piping hot, overflowing, and were beyond satisfying.  I think this is a little gem in the quaint streets of Montreal, we cleaned our plates, considered picking up some cheese and rillettes like the gentleman before us did, decided against it as customs may not appreciate it, and headed out to walk the cobblestones comforted by the fact that one can in fact be fed on the weekends.  I love you Marche de la Villette!"}
{"text":"My husband got the duck confit sandwich on French bread with lettuce and tomato which was pretty good, basically shredded duck in some crusty bread with some nice freshness and crispness from the lettuce and tomatoes.  I got the French onion soup and ham and cheese quiche and mixed greens.  The quiche was delicious, the egg was nice and fluffy with a certain sweetness to it in a flaky crust.  The salad was tossed with a basic balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  The servers all seemed very happy to be there, singing and dancing around, interacting and joking around with the guests, and were helpful and very nice."}
{"text":"Because Olive and Gourmando had a long wait and we were starving we decided to hop across the street to this joint. BIG MISTAKE. Not only did it take FOREVER for our food to come, when it did come, food was terrible. This is a cute spot in the Old Montreal area and I think the cuteness is what lures you in. But once you're in, the food is not that impressive. My brekkie dish had mostly potatoes. We waited over 40 minutes for everyone's dfferent egg order. Whatever it is eggs should not take 40 minutes to make. Are the eggs being hatched out back by the chickens? No excuse. The kitchen definitely doesn't have their sh*t together! The only saving grace for us was the baguette with butter that we asked for. Service was spotty. I saw that other tables that came and were seated after us got their food before us. Not cool at all."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite stops in Montreal and my favorite bistro is Marché de la Villette.  After recently browsing the internet, i noticed it was featured in food & wine restaurants and travel!!  This is the classic french bistro.  there is no bare wall in this small cafe.  The rustic walls are painted with fruits and vegetables, flowers, and trees.  The corners are adorned with life like flowers and greens.  And vintage canned foods border the restaurant, while dried meats hang above the counter.   the menu, if i remember correctly is in french, however i THINK they had english menus... its been 2 years..  the waiter was kind enough to explain the specials and the menu.  He had a thick french accent and greeted us with \"Bon aprés midi!\" and \"Vat will you be having madame?\"  we ordered the coldcut sampler which was overflowing with prosciutto, Genoa salami, ham, roast beef, dried sausages and some other meats i cannot name.  On one corner were two little jars filled with liver pate and ham pate.  Both were equally delicious and the best i've had.  Mixed baby greens and fresh toasted baguette were nestled into the empty cracks of the platter.  mmm divine!   We also had the quiche Lorraine served with a bed of mixed baby greens, the prosciutto sandwich, tomato cream soup, and a stuffed tomato with veal (this had a fancy french name, but i didn't write it down).  it was delicious!  the tomato stuffed veal sat on top of a bed of herbed rice.  Everything was so so so good. I cant wait to visit Montreal again just so i can lunch here.  Do order wine along with your meal like the french!       I love everything about his quaint restaurant.  Its located in downtown Montreal.  The streets are narrow and lined with eroded stones.  I really enjoy the uniqueness of its location.  What a great find.  Au revoir!"}
{"text":"Maybe because i had an early lunch but the salad greens where way past there prime I picked my way thru it and managed to eat about 1/2.  Waiter never checked back after delivering the salad. When I mentioned this to the manager he shouted back to the kitchen to \"check the salads\" There are many dining options in the St Paul's neighborhood so avoid this one"}
{"text":"Loved the sliding glass door entryway, it kept the whole restaurant warm in the subzero temperatures. Cozy and quaint inside with plenty of window seating. My date and I enjoyed the house red and a cronut. I don't want to be dramatic but I would describe the cronut as borderline life changing- flakey, buttery, and fresh. The restaurant is a tad touristy as evidenced by the endless French flags on the menu and plastic hams hanging from the ceiling. Overall, positive experience!"}
{"text":"In Montreal from St Paul we were searching for an authentic French/Parisian food experience. We chose La Villette on chance. The CroBurger (choice- my wife opted for foie gras) was superb. The croissant-type bun was super buttery.  I had the Feuillantine Comtoise, a croissant dough filled with ham, bechamel, cheese. Excellent!! We will definitely return. Such a wonderful find!"}
{"text":"Food is good but a bit on the salty side. We ordered the assiette de villette, which comes with a variety of charcuterie, including duck confit, and fromage AND the smoked meat sandwich. Bradley had the Belgian waffle with chocolate and fruit - the chocolate (I think it was Nutella) was delish, but the waffle was dry and hard.   The service was also lacking. We were seated immediately and given a menu, but it took almost 15 minutes, and a whole lot of looking around, before a waiter came to take our order. When it was all said and done, it took another 10 mins and 2 trips to the register to check out, because the girl at the register told me I had to wait for my bill before I can pay and then another waitress told me the bill was waiting for me at the register. Go figure...  Given the not so great review above, if you're wondering why I'm giving the place 3 stars, it's because of the setting/ambience. It's a very cute, quaint spot."}
{"text":"So this review has been marinating in my drafted reviews for awhile. Not on purpose, though. But it has been a couple months since my brief visit to Montreal. For that reason, it surprises me how vivid my memory of dining at Marche is.  First of all, this quaint little restaurant seemed to be in a popular area where cafes were aplenty. We chose it because we noticed they served beer (we were thirsty!) and someone we saw in the window was stuffing their mouth with what looked to be a really appetizing crepe.  To us, all beer and crepes are one helluva combo. Sold!  It's cramped when you first walk in. There's a cramped dining area to you right, then hop down a couple stairs to see a bigger dining area with some booths and then the counter/deli case where you can place your carryout order.  We squeezed into the front right dining area and were given menus - in French. In fact, everything was in French. (Yeah, yeah - I know I'm in Montreal ... but we don't speak French.)  After deciphering what we could from the menu (jambon = ham! I knew that one), I settled for the ham and brie crepe. Even if it was the only thing I could recognize on the menu, it was the best choice I could've ever made. My tastebuds were singing!! Everything about that crepe was made to perfection. And the accompanying side salad was equally as scrumptious. The perfect side to the heaviness of the crepe.  After sucking back a couple beers and finishing every bite of food on my plate, our peppy server brought over a dessert waffle smothered in chocolate - on the house! I'm positive he knew we were tourists - it was obvious - so we deeply appreciated the gesture. So nice! And it was tasty to boot. (That's a given though, it's a chocolate waffle!)  Thanks for a great meal & memory, Marche!"}
{"text":"Cute little place! I would've loved to try the fondue it looked fun!"}
{"text":"Charming service. Great offering. Authentic feel.  And - maybe in part because it was a cold rainy day outside - the French Onion soup brought a tear to my eye."}
{"text":"Overrated, tourist trap.  If you're American, think full-service La Madeleine.  Food is hit or miss- my wife thought her omelet was the best she had ever had, while my Croque Madame was as tasty as a prison baloney sandwich covered with melted cheese!  Service was pretty dismal, our middle-aged Asian waitress was the only one running around like a chicken with her head cut off, while her colleagues seemed to managed their tables fine.  There was no hello or any checking to see how we were doing- just an order taker and check giver- that's it!  You would be better off just finding a coffee shop with breakfast sandwiches, rather than wait in line, wait to order, wait for the food and overpay for breakfast @ CA$60 with tip!    On our departure from Montreal, we stopped at an airport cafe (Trudeau) called Urban Crave for breakfast and my breakfast plate was awesome for CA$12 and our server gave us 100x better service than any other restaurant in Old Montreal ever did!"}
{"text":"Ugh the ugly one star...if the shoe fits... As my mom said \"why would I give them any stars\".  I was starving and looking for a place to eat in Montreal. Apparently the starving feeling is a bit of the norm. While walking around we found this cute French restaurant. The decor was lovely and they were serving breakfast all day.   I ordered an egg white omelette with vegetables and my mom ordered a tuna sandwich. Most importantly when I ordered I told him I was ALLERGIC to onions and to please not put any on my food. I even asked him to clarify what vegetables were in the omelette. He said they wouldn't put any onions in it. I also asked for some toast with my omelette but he stated they didn't have any toast and could provide a baguette instead.   When he handed me my plate their were tons of onions on my salad. I looked down at my plate and he said \"so you want them to remake it. He wasn't very nice about it but I said no it's ok. I figured I could pick the onions off the salad since they were big. However, when I started to eat my omelette it was filled with onions. I had to take them all out and unfortunately got sick. (Onions inflame my intestines) Good thing I had my medication with me.  Our waiter wasn't very friendly and we never saw him after he brought our food. So I was anxious to pay the bill and get out of there. I asked for the bill but he never came, so I just went up to the register and asked her to ring me out. She told me it was $42 and I thought that was a lot but I just paid.    Our bill was $42 and with tip I was over $50 for an omelette, baguette, and a tuna sandwich (not very big).  I know I was nice to leave a tip! Later once I arrived home from my vacation I saw the receipt from our lunch. They charged me $13 for the baguette. Shame on them!   My mom mentioned later to me that she had told our waiter there were onions in the food and his response was \"I told her they would remake it\". Um yeah, I have no idea there was a bucket load of onion in my omelette too! We thought he meant they were going to remake my salad since it was covered with onions. To say the least, there are endless choices of French restaurants in Montreal, so we will not be back!"}
{"text":"We took a food tour of Old Town/ Vieux Port, and this was out second stop. We tasted pork and duck pate here. After the tour, we returned to have a full lunch. The staff is friendly, the menu is extensive, and the food quality is very good. A great place to try local specialties, like the charcuterie platter or pate. They also have house-made quiches, cronuts, burgers, and so much more."}
{"text":"I agree with another reviewer that the service, while friendly, was abysmal. Our waiter was seating guests, taking orders, refilling glasses, teasing the girls...everything but bringing our food to the table within a reasonable time.  We waited 45 mins for french onion soup, then they brought 1 crepe another fifteen minutes later.  The french soup was OK but far from great.  The broth was tasty, the soup was not hot but warm, the bread and cheese topping were good but the most distressing part was that the onions were still raw and crunchy.  The ham and cheese crepe was better and the side salad was a welcome accompaniment.  It then took us another 20 minutes to get the check.  It is very annoying to see other quests walk-in after us, get served, eat, pay their bill & leave while we were still waiting.  Our hotel suggested this place but I will let them know to stop sending their guests here."}
{"text":"This place was the only restaurant around that was open on a Sunday for brunch. At first thought, I thought it was pretty cute...but then I realized it was sort of a set up for tourists and I was a sucker.   If the food blew me away - I wouldn't have cared how cheesy the plastic slabs of meat hanging in the window were! But sadly, my Apple/Brie/Turkey Sandwich came without the apple. I was disappointed - because the apple is what makes it... am I right?"}
{"text":"we went there for breakfast and were very disappointed. I really don't think it deserve the rather high ranking they have on yelp. the service was really unfriendly, and i noticed after leaving that the cashier had added a 25% tip on my bill without informing me. There is so much better in Montreal"}
{"text":"The cronuts & creton are the best! We stopped in two days in a row just for that. Service is slow if you're an American diner, but probably adequately paced if you're Quebecois."}
{"text":"Right out of a story book.  After traveling to Paris I thought I'd never get to taste croque madame again. Little I knew i won't get to taste it but will have probably one of the best croque madames created.   From the entrance till exist it's a cozy feel without any snootiness. It's not your fro Fro fancy white table restaurant but it's nothing short of class in a warm way.  Their food smells and tastes of freshness.   Of course you can't beat the location. It just can't get more Parisian alike than this area. Right in the heart of old Montreal it's away from the touristy area yet not too quiet. Very good for people watching.  Generous portions, especially the skillets, and not at all pricy. You'll definitely leave satisfied.   The server who we were lucky to have two days in a row, was very friendly and took his time to explain the menu.   Being such a gem of a place you'll expect lots of people and since they don't take reservations you might have to wait a bit. But if you get there before 11am you'll easily get a table.  Just do yourself a favor. When in Montreal give your taste buds a culinary treat and enjoy their brunch. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"***This restaurant is a tourist trap.***  Oy. What a disappointing experience. I wanted to like this place - despite the average 3.5-star rating. Walked by, cute place from the outside, snagged a seat by the window, and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. Twenty minutes went by before our server finally approached us. Unapologetic, he asked for our drink order; we decided to order everything to avoid another MIA server.   The best part... I requested a glass of champagne, but was told they didn't have any. I asked how they make the mimosas they market on the menu? Response: white wine, SEVEN UP, and orange juice. C'mon folks. Would a true French-Canadian accept that response?!   I ordered a glass of white wine and soup - despite my hunger. I was done with this place. We went on to wait another ten minutes before he approached us again and admitted he'd forgotten my husband's drink order. Fast forward, we received dirty spoons with our soup and had to wait for clean ones. We ate our soup and left. Terrible service, mediocre food, dirty dishes, and fake drinks. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Charcuterie, terrine and fromage plates. Cute little spot with some desserts from Juliette & Chocolat. Oui oui!"}
{"text":"This was just about the very best FRENCH Onion soup that I've had in my life. Extremely tasty & just the right temp. The sandwich that came with it was just as tasty. Go to his place instead the Olive & Gourmando....it's right across the street."}
{"text":"Review is based only on the french onion soup, which guide book said is a local's favorite.  It wasn't bad but didn't care for the flavor.  It didn't have a red wine flavor but more like vinegar.  Cheese didn't taste of the best quality.  Cute place though and I'm sure other items are better!"}
{"text":"BEWARE.. this place microwaves their food. What a total waste of money ... truly shows how much they lack in passion for cooking French food. My creo monsieur looked nice but the. The bread was soft, hummid, and warm... typical sign of something being microwaved. The cheese was of poor quality.   Staff was eating while we were there and serviced was nowhere to be found. Bill came out to 77 dollars for a truly mediocre experience. TURIST TRAP"}
{"text":"Le cadre est sympathique si la musique n'était pas trop forte même si on pourra dire qu'on est dans du total cliché.   Les plats sont bon, du moins les produits mais ils manques cruellement d'assaisonnement. N'oubliez pas de rajouter du sel.   Bref, simplement moyen."}
{"text":"The food is great, service was just ok but this is a great spot in Old Montreal.  We were at bota bota and were pretty hungry. This place was packed and smelled amazing so we stopped in. The wait was not more than 15 minutes.    The service that wasn't great was more our waiter. Slow to come over to us, never brought us water after asking, etc.  That being said, we ordered the charcuterie platter and a chocolate/banana crepe. The food was really good, charcuterie looks nice on a small platter and everything on the plate was delicious.    Great nice little spot in the old area, worth checking out especially for lunch/brunch."}
{"text":"The ambiance is so charming, so quaint, so French!  I love this area in downtown Montreal!  As far as the food, my order didn't meet my expectation. I had the Quiche Lorraine which came with fresh fruit. I expected a piping hot, cheesy gooey, eggy fluffy and crispy bacon quiche. What I got was a lukewarm, egg dry, cheeseless, cube ham (yuck) filled flakeless pie crust. At least they were light on the salt.  But it was not fresh, almost tasted like it was frozen or sitting out too long. Maybe other menu choices were better. Just don't order the Quiche! Sadly, the fresh fruit was the only sweet part of my lunch.   The decor is kitschy French; nice touch. There's was a line and the wait was about 20 mins.;not bad considering it was Saturday early afternoon.  I recommend other eateries to try as there are plenty of choices within walking distance. This was our 2nd choice since the wait at Olive and Gourmando was about an hour. Both were recommended by a local tour guide. Maybe Olive and Gourmando wouldn't been worth the wait. At least next time I know!"}
{"text":"The epitome of a chartcuterie, just great atmosphere, and great food.  We shared a  cheese fondue which was served with a small board of charcuterie and was just perfect.  The menu consisted of some great classic, traditional dishes like French Onion Soup and cassoulet."}
{"text":"The main kudos that need to be given to Marche de la villette is for having vegetarian food on the menu; a high achievement for a french restaurant.   I loved the atmosphere with the silly decorations and the warm lighting. The menu is expansive and victory!!! there is a  veggie option. A pair at my table got the fondue which they raved about.   I had the french onion soup which was okay; nothing that would make me return.   Now the reason for the 3-star review is the service. The waiters were nice but they were not very attentive. There was also a table of diners that seemed to be the owners/employees who were just being incredibly obnoxious. It created a horrible atmosphere in an otherwise charming restaurant. The house wine we got was also horrible at best.   I don't think i'd go back mainly because their veggie option was average and I wasn't impressed by the service."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Came here for lunch with friends.  I had the Brie sandwich and a cronut (croissant donut). Both were amazing!! Great service and vibrant atmosphere. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Charming, fun and very lively - perfect for a long lunch filled with wine. Some may say its a bit too touristy (100% french - music, food, etc.) but the delicious food and overall charm make up for it. Appetizer plats to share are delicious and the fondue and wine are a must. It gets crowded so be ready to get cozy with the neighbors."}
{"text":"Rustic, hectic, packed, fabulous, cozy cafe with a Parisian flair in both decor and flavor in Old Montreal. Stumbled upon this gem as we came in from the Metro and decided to walk as much of Rue St. Paul as possible.   Three of us did not finish every bite on the diverse charcuterie board of bread and various meats, pates, fruits, and a tealight-melting cheese trough. Bon jour, gorgeous.   An enormous brownie somehow made its way to the table, and was so decadently gooey we had to cross the Canadian border to get it. The baked goods in the case at the rear of the cafe all looked scrumptious, as did the freshly baked baguettes being loaded into an overhead tray.   Some folks seemed to come in for takeaway, lining up in the back where the register is and where you pay your bill (they take credit cards).   A terrific and vibrant atmosphere with self-proclaimed crazy Frenchmen, and chic decor galore. They spoke French until it was clear we were not fluent, and they transitioned into English out of pity and not snobbishness. Thrilled to have found this tasty, enjoyable spot and would recommend any hungry Yelper seek it out. C'est magnifique!"}
{"text":"I bought a ham and cheese sandwic, not bad but nothing of special and it costed 9,95$!! Too expensive. Btw the service was fast (it was 2:30pm) and nice, it's a touristic place but nice. I don't know if I would suggest to someone."}
{"text":"Ok so it's a little over-the-top on the faux French country themed decor but you have to forgive them once you eat here. The quality of our meal was superb and the staff were really attentive. Avoid the house wines and order a Pastis or something fun like that. We enjoyed a spread of meats and cheeses, gazpacho, salads and finished off with a crepe. My husband's local co-workers often bring their clients and out-of-town guest here because they know it won't disappoint and we were happy to have that insider tip."}
{"text":"My friend and I had different maps so we were going in circles looking for this place, but it was well worth it!!!  The four of us sat down right away. There were only a few tables occupied since we arrived at a fairly odd time. Around 3pm.   Our waiter was pleasant and hilarious! We were entertained. The place well decorated with cool assortments of bistro style pictures and signs.  We looked through the menu, ordered some mouth-watering sangria, and couldn't decide what we wanted so we asked him to put together a plate of meats/cheese for us, whatever he recommends. So he did.   The assortment of pate/meats that we ate were the most amazing I've ever had. I WANT TO GO BACK. I wish it were right down the street from my house.   GO HERE. You wont regret it!"}
{"text":"This spot sits on my favorite corner in Montreal. The food is excellent and beers never stop but what I love are the people that work there. The owner is my new friend and the wait staff is the best. They loved seeing us come back and remembered all of names. Mikey is the best!! If you are in Montreal just pick a corner table and relax and enjoy the beautiful people walking by and order some food. Don't be shy."}
{"text":"Delicious charcuterie served with a cheese fondue? It sounded off but ended up being delicious for a cold late winter day.  The onion confit was amazing: I want the recipe! Insanity ruled, long lines and finally the electricity failed throughout - but it was fun.  Fair warning: we waited forever for our food so if you're hungry, don't venture here: one star lost for the wait...."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give zero stars, this would be the time. The sad part is I can't even speak to the quality of the food here because based on the service we left almost immediately after the waiter took our order (before it was sent to the cooks). We were seated immediately which was good. I'll skip particulars and get to the heart of it. The waiter made a joke about slavery to my fiancé and I. Completely unprofessional, tacky, and weird. We left soon after in disgust. Additionally, if you're offering mimosas and YOU run out of the champagne you use, it's your responsibility to price match that to what you have left, not ours."}
{"text":"Great cozy place! Wait staff was fabulous and friendly. Very accommodating to our quirky 5. There was something on the menu for each of our wants/needs. A relaxed atmosphere"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Simple country French no frills. Service poor. I was happy to linger but waitress didn't refill water or offer more wine. No forks with our desserts and no one to ask for one. VERY expensive for what you get. Seems like a tourist trap."}
{"text":"4 1/2 Star.   Such a sweet, quaint cafe! I loved the cozy feel on such a cold winter day, it was picture perfect.  The servers were all French/Canadian and so polite, they made me feel like I was in another country. (Loved every minute!)  They have great quality charcuterie plates and pastries, all made in house. Their coffee was exceptional!  This was a special treat before heading back to the US, I hope to come back one day soon!  Thank you for a wonderful Parisian experience!   Bonjour!"}
{"text":"This was the the first place we tried in Montreal, but even after a week of other places, it is the highlight of the trip.  The onion soup was perfect. The charcuterie was amazing.  The service was very fun, but you need to have a thick skin!"}
{"text":"I've had stopped here on a previous trip months ago but only ordered a coffee to go. The atmosphere have such a lasting impression that I had to find it and go back on my next trip. This time I was able to sit down and order a meal with a friend. I got the Crepe B...(something in French). It was Egg, Swiss, Asparagus, Ham and some sauce. Excellent dish, came out pretty quick, and also came with a small fresh fruit bowl. My Capaccino was delicious as well. (Get it for there. They never taste the same in a paper cup no matter where you go.) I also tasted some Coffee Egclar that my friend ordered and it put a smile on my face.   Some people on here say it's too touristy...I say, who cares! The food is delicious, authentic, and the atmosphere is cozy and perfect. It can get busy at brunch and lunch since I heard them taking reservations but we're very prompt and polite about it too waiting customers. The staff also get a big 5 stars for being super helpful and friendly. Good job guys, looking forward to my next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"What is with all of the great ratings?! The woman who served us was rude. I ordered salade nicoise and my mom the crepe. Out came two salads and when my mom said she ordered the crepe she was rudely told \"no, you asked what was in the nicoise\". She DID ask but when told it had anchovies she ordered the crepe. There was no offer to take it back. WORSE NICOISE EVER. It's a mix of tons mayonnaise and tuna, and an egg topped with an anchovie over a bed of greens. No green beans, no potato..just awful  My stomach is off now 5 min after the meal and all I taste is fish. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"A must stop!! The very best chocolate croIssant I have ever had! Wonderful omelettes, salads, waffles. Charming authentic atmosphere  And warm friendly staff. My new Favorite place in Montreal !!"}
{"text":"A very cute place to have lunch during a stroll through Old Montreal! The fondue for 2 tasted fantastic and included a huge sampling of the cured meats and generous amount of crusty bread. MIL loved the smoked meat sammy."}
{"text":"I was hell bent on finding a place for lunch that served corque Monsieur. Wandering down Rue St Paul, I came across this lovely bistro. This is a very small, lovely place to grab lunch while strolling Old Montreal.  The wait staff was super accommodating and nice. I started with a cup of a pumpkin soup, which was interesting. Can't say I loved it, but it was ok.  My corque Monsieur was not as good as the ones I have had in Bordeaux, but it was ok.   It was a nice little cafe to grab a quick bite. Nothing over the top, but quick, decent food."}
{"text":"Other than being a bit expensive it's adorable. The hosts are friendly and ready to help. The food is delicious and it's in beautiful Old Montreal."}
{"text":"solid, not spectacular.  Good value and tasty charcuterie."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience we had at this restaurant today. We stopped in for brunch on our way out of town and it was fantastic!!! The service was on point. Our waiter was so hospitable, friendly and funny!! The  croissants were the best I think I've ever had and that includes having them in Paris!  The baguette was perfect. I took some home!!!  We will definitely return here. Thank you"}
{"text":"Nice and warm enviroment, servers are very friendly and funny, makes lots of jokes, fod is nice and tasty. The duck pate sandwich was so nice, also the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"A bit touristy, but the lines are shorter here than at Olive & Gourmando which I was trying to go to across the street. I got the charcuterie board with cheese, baguette, pate, and more charcuterie than I could eat! It was all terrific and the ambiance of the place was wonderful. Highly recommended. Not too super pricy either."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of having lunch here in July. Had the Croque Monsieur and it was by the far the best I have ever had. It came with a side salad and we ordered a quart of red wine.   The waiters and waitresses were very outgoing and the service was extremely fast given the place was packed at 12:00 in the afternoon. You litererally feel you are in France from the second you walk in the door (not to mention after 3 glasses of wine). The atmosphere is very happy and upbeat and coupled with the delicious food, it was a great overall experience."}
{"text":"There were flies everywhere. Service was good, but i tried to order each one of the pastries which were \"unavailable\" for half the day and there was no advertisement for this. Got a crepe and it was just a full banana with some nutella and powdered sugar"}
{"text":"Ok I think this place is over rated! Seriously people! just because its located in the old Montreal. If you are meat lover then this is your place but be prepared to spend $$$$. Their sandwiches are not big for the price and the bread is not even toasted. It tasted like 3 days old bread. They only had one vegetarian sandwich with it SUCKED! I would go someplace else for deli type food. The service was ok."}
{"text":"Bad service.  Did not eat, chose to leave after waiting 15 minutes without a menu, and another 10 without any service."}
{"text":"Quaint little nook in Old Port Montreal!   Recommend the lovely breakfast  skillets and the croque Monsieur"}
{"text":"The service was so slow but the vibe is very nice especially on a cold cold day. The waiters are kind but again just so SLOW. Food was good, just fair."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Montreal.  I loved the ambiance which is very charming and cozy.  The menu has a great selection and we had the charcuterie board which was delicious and a huge portion for under $20. I would go to Montreal just to eat here."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice, and am always happy. I will say the first time we came here in 2012, the waiter was a little more playful and let me speak french with him- this time the chick meant business. Which is completely fine, but in being you are in a french speaking city, it's fun to try! I was fluent by the time I left Montreal before- and this time was more hesitant. Comfort level I guess? I digress.  The food is so good, so fresh and so filling! I had the quiche loriane with a mimosa. Last time the glasses were bigger, but it was just as good. I know everyone at the table REALLY enjoyed their food. Service was great- and the dessert was even better. Who gets dessert with breakfast? Only on vacation I guess!  I suggest trying this place if you are in Old Montreal. The food is very very good. It's a fun atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here. The waiters are fun and make you feel like family.  It has old world charm. It is small about 50 small tables squeezed into the space but it  causes a close family feeling."}
{"text":"Un bel endroit sympathique et invitant. Après un 15 minutes de recherche de restaurant, nous avons entré dans celui-ci et avons été bien reçu immédiatement. Moi et mon copain avons essayé les burgers, dont un qui a un pain en croissant et c'était très cochon, mais délicieux. Les prix sont abordables, bon service, pas vraiment d'attente, bonne musique. J'y retournerais avec plaisir."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré! En commençant par le bonjour très chaleureux dès les premiers pas dans cette boucherie/sandwicherie/café parisien, jusqu'à l'au revoir qui a dû durer un bon 10 minutes vu que par ce moment là, la conversation avec les serveurs avait été tellement bonne qu'on partageait nos recettes de Noël!  Le décor vous transportera dans un café de France tout comme Virginie le dit. J'ai essayé un croque-monsieur et la personne avec qui j'étais a pris une salade niçoise. Dans les deux cas, les portions étaient très généreuses, les ingrédients frais et pleins de saveures. Bien que l'on n'avait rien commandé pour le dessert, notre charmant serveur nous a emmené des gaufres avec une sauce au chocolat en nous disant \"Ma femme trouve que je la gâte trop donc au lieu j'en profite et je gâte mes clients parce qu'ici je peux faire ce qu'il me plaît\". Ce petit commentaire a été suivi d'un clin d'oeil à une jolie dame assise seule et il lui a dit \"Mais si vous êtes célibataire madame, bien je n'ai pas de femme...c'est juste une histoire que je raconte aux autres.\" Le coquin!  Petit bonus qui fait que cet endroit mérite toutes les étoiles permises : on m'a appelé « princesse » tout au long du repas et ça m'a fait sourire tout le reste de la journée. C'est un détail qui ne peut pas être répliqué par tous mais qui m'a complètement charmée en cette super belle journée d'hiver."}
{"text":"Thank you for the wonderful crepes. They were the last meal we at on our trip to Montréal. Absolutely fabulous. Large. Great salad. Great dressing. Just enough syrup, meat, and cheese. My favorite was how the brie, cheddar, and goat cheese all complimented each other with the smokey ham which was chopped just perfectly.  Great surroundings, too. Perfect location. Walking distance from Notre Dame.  They advertise wifi, but we weren't able to find the network."}
{"text":"Walked the Old Montreal area looking for a unique breakfast experience on a Sunday and found it here at Marché de la Villette, a uniquely decorated Parisian-style cafe restaurant.  Lots of various lighting and adornments on the walls.  Pretty cool.  The food was very good!  I had the Crepe Bretonne which was a swiss cheese-filled crepe topped with ham, béchamel and asparagus.  The menu actual said it contained egg but I really didn't notice it.  Maybe it was inside the crepe with the cheese? :)  Whatever, it was great.   The cappuccino was very nice.  The coffee was not bitter and the milk was very thick and creamy but still light in texture.    I followed up with a pear and chocolate tart from what I felt was an excellent selection of dessert items.  Another cappuccino.  Friendly and prompt service.  French cafe background music fit the place well.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out while in Old Montreal because of the decorations. Needless to say that it was a particularly special atmosphere for a tourist that was very pleasant and felt like I was in the heart of Paris. All of the service was friendly and everyone I interacted with spoke both French and English. We ordered a baguette and cheese combo platter for an appetizer, which was both fun and delicious! They provided an appropriate amount of bread to cheese ratio. Then I had the Nutella & Banana crep.  My reason for a less than stellar review is for a couple reasons, the first being the slower than expected service, since it took roughly 40 minutes for my friend and I to receive our dishes after the appetizer was complete. We were tourists in a foreign city trying to get the most out of the little time we had. Additionally, they packed in so many tables that it was a challenge navigating to the cash register and the exit, weaving in and out of isles made it slightly awkward disturbing people's meals. Furthermore, the density of tables in the space seemed like a fire hazard, not to mention most things were made out of wood."}
{"text":"A petit bistro on the cobblestone road, you walk in and everything just feels so French. You can study here, you can go on a date here. The restaurant is so versatile and so cute - you simply don't find places like this elsewhere in North America. Please visit and share a plate of cheese!"}
{"text":"The food was good, although premade. We ordered a smoked meat sandwich and quiche. The service started out fine; the waiters were friendly and chatting people up as they sang and danced from table to table. But then the time started passing and we were waiting 45 minutes just to get someone's attention so we could get the check, after already waiting 30 minutes for our food to be brought out. At first, since it was one of our first meals here, we thought it was a cultural thing, like in Europe. But the line from cultural to poor service was quickly crossed and we were getting more and more impatient as we saw people who came in after us were paid more attention than we were. Other servers took patron's empty plates and asked if they wanted dessert, coffee, etc. Our server did not. Instead, he quickly took our plates and was behind the counter washing dishes immediately afterwards (never to come back), and no other server would give us the time of day. They only seemed to say something after I put my coat on and my partner had their card visible in their hand. We had originally wanted to order a cronut and espresso, but as the time passed we just wanted to get the hell out of there. When we finally got the bill, they didn't even let us pay right there. You have to then go wait in line behind people who came in only to order takeout.   Overall, the quiche was good and the decor was really really really cute, but the service was the absolute pits. We weren't the only table that looked irritated while waiting for the check, either. It seemed only large groups or french speakers were getting any attention."}
{"text":"My first real poutine because nothing I had before counts. Great french atmosphere, as if you're in Paris"}
{"text":"Food is good, soundtrack is wonderful, and ambiance is fantastic. But when you're more concerned with empty tables and chatting with your colleagues, then there's a problem. Every time I had to flag down an inattentive staff member, it was downright painful. I'd understand if the place was ridiculously busy, but it was barely half full. I know the French way of doing things involves long, relaxing lunches, but being forced into a long lunch because of bad service is not my idea of the way a restaurant should be run."}
{"text":"I had walked to his area of Old Montreal to try out Olive & Gourmando, which had closed for a vacation. Whomp whomp.   And hungry, I was done in by \"charcuterie\" on the window and the dried meats hanging in the front of the restaurant. I could tell that it was a bit of a tourist trap -- I was in Old Montreal, after all -- but it just looked so inviting.  I wish I would have listened to my instincts and to Yelp instead of my grumbling tummy.  I mean, it was just OK. (Considering I only had a few precious days in Montreal, each experience counted.)  I ordered the ham crepe. It had asparagus, gruyère cheese, egg and bechamel sauce, with sliced apples on top and a side salad. The ham was tough. In my attempt to cut it, my fork accidentally slid across my plate and onto the floor.   Which brings me to a big reason why I'm only giving three stars. The serving was definitely lacking. The waitress was curt and was in such a rush that she dropped my plate on my table in passing. I don't think she slowed down on her trip down the aisle by my table, and I was surprised that my plate didn't end up in my lap.   After waiting about 5-10 minutes for the waitress to pass by my table again, so that I could ask for a new fork, I finally asked a nearby diner to pass me a fork from an unused place setting on his table.   It was a bit cramped, and the waitress seemed eager for me to finish up and release the table, from her attitude on her last visit to my table. But on the brighter side, this meant that I got my food quickly.   It seems like there are better restaurants in the area, so if I ever visit Montreal again, I'll try some other place instead of a return trip here."}
{"text":"Great place though quite hectic. Too many tables make it hard to move around the dining room. Quite a production just to get to a table, bathroom, etc. The food was great - had the cassoulet and a nice salad nicoise. Great service."}
{"text":"Definitely my  favorite restaurant on my trip to Montreal. The menu itself is incredible - SO much to choose from. I had a casserole kind of dish for brunch with cheese / shallots and meat / potatoes - was amazing. Perfect blend of spices and vegetables. My friend had the Croque Madame which was equally delicious. I saw other tables getting what looked like amazing cheese & meat platters / fondue's and colorful salads. Will definitely want to return to this restaurant for dinner next time. Also in an incredible part of the Old Montreal neighborhood. Very classic style french cuisine and service."}
{"text":"Very cute little place with lots of character and a deli at the back of the restaurant. However the food was not to my standards. I had the French onion soup and the croquet Monsieur. The croquet Monsieur was basically a ham sandwich with mayo that was baked with cheese on top. Nothing was holding the sandwich together, I would have preferred the cheese be in the sandwich. I also wasn't a fan of the sourdough bread, but I just don't like sourdough bread in genera."}
{"text":"Went here with my fiancé for brunch cause we didn't want to line up at Olive & Gourmando (we regret it). The food was okay, but we didn't have a good experience. First of all, I got a very visibly dirty mug for my tea at first. The waiter apologized and he brought me a new one. Then we overheard the ladies at the table next to us also weren't getting the baguette they asked for, so she just cancelled it as she basically already finished her food and never got the baguette. Then at the end, another server (female) just took our plates away and stacking each thing one by one on the other table (where the ladies that asked for the baguette sat). So those ladies and us shared a confused look and glances as that is a very rude thing to do. You can't just take empty plates from one table and start stacking them on other tables before you get a comfortable grip of them to take back to the kitchen. That was very awkward. I had the Croque Madame and my fiancé had the asparagus crepe. He thought his was standard, mine was not bad, but nothing special. Had much better ones elsewhere. We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"A little kitschy with its decor and equivalent of show tunes music - that plenty of people were signing to - but you'll definitely find something for everyone here. While the prices are average for the area (high), they delivered on tasty, classic French food without being an overly fancy experience.  I went for the smoked meat sandwich, which was great and not too greasy. I could have eaten much more of the meat since it tasted so good. It's also worth giving a shout out to the small but tasty side salad (if you can believe it), as it was a great compliment to my meal.  Not many beers to choose from but found something that was refreshing on a hot day.  Pay up at the counter.  Probably not something I would have picked just walking by, but I am glad we had a meal here."}
{"text":"Went in here for a quick lunch with my family. The atmosphere and vibe was quite fun, but our food was rather disappointing. We ordered the ham and cheese crepe and croque monsieur, two simple dishes that are usually kept salty, only to have them both smothered in maple syrup. I don't know if this was Quebec twist to the dish, but I personally thought it ruined it.   We also had an order of cassoulet and it too was disappointing.  This small restaurant is essentially a tourist trap."}
