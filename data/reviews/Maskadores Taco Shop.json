{"text":"Tried the barbacoa, green chili, red chili and Tanga (I think) chicken tacos. All meats were very good. Friendly staff, reasonably priced! We ordered a side of rice and beans for $1.99 and received huge portions. Cream cheese sauce is yummy."}
{"text":"On my first visit, I tried the 5 street tacos. These are made with 2 small (4\"?) corn tortillas, then filled with your choice of meat and toppings. I tried the tinga chicken, which was slightly spicy and very good. I also had the carne asada (good), and the excellent green chile beef. This last was shredded beef seasoned with a green chile sauce. Highly recommended.  One small warning here, if you're a big guy or really hungry, you will need to order something in addition.  Nice, friendly staff."}
{"text":"this place has legit mexican fare, the burritos were great and tostadas were excellent too, I highly recommened this place over say a chain place like chipotle or taco del mar"}
{"text":"I saw some of the reviews and decided to give it a try. The food is magnificent! I had the taco salad with carne asada and pinto beans. The meat has a great flavor and the beans are tender and flavorful as well. Very good place, clean and well kept. I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"The food is great. I'd recommend the 5 street tacos. I really like the quesadillas! The 5 rolled tacos are great with a topping of jalapeño cream cheese."}
{"text":"Man this place never disappoints. I've been coming here for a year in a half, and feel like this place is a second home...wow that got deep. I lived in a border town up until my teens and this place brings me back to my childhood, it's real Mexican food.   Service: I love all the workers here. They may not seem like they're super attentive but I think their main priority is getting everyone's food out to them as fast as possible and making sure it's tasty. That's perfectly fine with me because this place can get really slammed where the line is to the door, yet the wait isn't too bad (maybe ten minutes at most).   Decor: I love the decor. LOVE. Especially if you're a fan of Mexican culture, it's really nice to look at and a conversation starter for sure.   Food: I've yet to have something here I haven't enjoyed. The fish tacos and wet burrito (with red chile carnitas) remain my top two faves. The burrito bowls are good, the quesadillas are huge and sizable, and the burritos delicious. I really like that you can customize what you want in and on your food.   Price: similar to Chiptole prices. Some might think this place is a little pricey but for the amount of food they give you and the QUALITY of the food, it's cheap.   I really like this place and love seeing it do well."}
{"text":"I just had an amazing three sauce chimichanga with green chili beef. They've been open about four months. Not a fancy place, but the food seems to be very very good."}
{"text":"You don't even understand how happy it makes me that this is literally the closest restaurant to my house. Tempe is somewhat of a Mexican food desert (BECAUSE I DONT COUNT FILISQUIRTOS AS REAL FOOD DUH) so having Mucha Lucha as a burrito sanctuary is essential to my lifestyle. EAT THERE TRUST ME."}
{"text":"I am a Mexican food connoisseur and this is by far my favorite restaurant. I'm a huge fan of carne asada and I thought I knew what good carne asada was until I went here. It's perfect, no exaggeration. None of that chewy, fatty meat that you can get at other restaurants.   Plus, since they remodeled, the artwork on the walls is fantastic. It definitely makes it a fun place to eat."}
{"text":"Visiting Tempe today from San Diego, and saw high ratings on this place from fellow Yelpers. Tried a little of everything...and loved it!!! Very fresh food...just watch out for the red sauce - muy picante!!! Will definitely be back if I am ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"Great find for some excellent tacos! Had the street tacos. Carne Asada, Chicken & Green Chili Pork. Couldn't pick a favorite, they were all great."}
{"text":"Awesome. Everything is delicious and at 99 cents for a taco you can't go wrong. I need to make it a habit to eat here more often."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurant i've been to. The salsas are spicy but so great. The owners are so friendly and they will do anything to help your visit be the best. You see everything they put into your food and everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, big tasty burritos, and a really nice owner. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend and I happened to be in the area...  That said, it did NOT disappoint.  Breakfast burritos ALL day, enough said..."}
{"text":"Great find. Thank you Yelp!  Fresh ingredients and super friendly ladies making the tacos.  Loved the spicy beef.  In dyer need if rebranding to communicate the great quality inside.  Awesome food, clean space, and value to boot."}
{"text":"The street tacos were really good!  Our new spot, the restaurant is clean and the environment is bright and fun.  The people were very friendly, can't wait to try more stuff on the menu.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow! Followed Yelp recommendations and it did not fail! Excellent service and the food is great. Custom everything from tacos to burritos. You have to stop by this shop."}
{"text":"Why so stingy with the meat on the tacos? The food was good. It did lack a bit of freshness and you can tell by looking at the lettuce. Staff was a bit slow as well. I cook one cashier and one help. There were maybe 6 people in front of me and it took 15 mins before I was able to order. I'm more used to fast paced taco shops. Oh don't order the guac. They don't even fill that little side cup to the top!!! Whack!!!!!!!Anyways...folks won't be coming back anytime soon until I hear they change their ways."}
{"text":"Tried to keep it simple for my first time. The rolled tacos and street tacos were delicious!!  Salsa bar added the perfect accent!  Very quaint but comfortable. It was very slow considering the quality of the food. Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick Mexican food fix, and I'm glad I did. Huge and delicious barbacoa burrito was just what I needed. Very nice people move you through the line quickly."}
{"text":"So we tried this Taco place just because we wanted something quick and Taco truck style food. I was blown away buy the taste of the food. My daughter ordered the street tacos and I had the nachos. Both were delicious and much more tasty than expected. Priced a little high but definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap mexican food. Large portions and the wet burrito is fantastic. As are the nachos and churros"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. This a mom and pop version of Chipotle or more along the Freebird style of burrito. Wet style is a good sauce and a little bit spicy. We didn't have tacos, but they looked good on others plates."}
{"text":"Mountain bikers always know where to get a great taco or burrito. We stopped by Fountain Hills for a quick look around and when we asked where to get a great meal, the unanimous answer was \"Maskadores!\" right behind the shop. Boy, they were right! Great food (the Taco Truck tacos hit the spot), great salsas, and great service. Clean and neat, good atmosphere. Ride, walk, or run to this place as fast as you can!"}
{"text":"Yelped tacos and found this delicious hole in the wall place.  Awesome tacos, carne asada is super good no fat gristle found, all savory meat.  Red hot sauce is extremely hot yet tasty.  Will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican restaurant I've found in the Phoenix area so far! Street tacos are perfect."}
{"text":"Great burritos (I had the carne asada), super friendly staff, clean, a nice pickle/peppers bar, and quick. Recommended."}
{"text":"Would not have guessed by the outside. But this is really great fresh food. I had the bowl. I like how they serve Chipotle style with added bonus of sauces fresh lemon in little containers to make a great quick dinner to go."}
{"text":"We stopped in today around 530.  The staff was friendly and the food was great.  We both had carme asada burritos and chips and salsa.  We would definitely go back when we are in town.  We are visiting from Colorado."}
{"text":"I never knew it was right around the corner, thanks Yelp! My first visit was excellent. The food was fresh and delicious. I had quite an appetite so the three tacos were not enough. Luckily, my wife could not finish her burrito. I am sure we will be returning."}
{"text":"Had the bandera wet burrito with Chipotle chicken. It was excellent! Plan to come back next time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Very good food. I had a carne asada burrito bowl with jalapeño cream cheese and the charred corn salsa added. One of the best I ever had, I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Updating my review from 2013.  I visited this place today, and spent over $12 on lunch.  I got a burrito bowl, horchata, chips, salsa, and guacamole on my bowl.  I really don't care that I spent $12 on my lunch - but what makes me sad about this place is how stingy they've gotten with their portions.  I used to be able to take this bowl, eat half for lunch, and half for dinner... and if I remember, I probably paid less in the past for it!   I had to ask for additional corn and salsa, and was given a 'look' for it as well.  The amount of salsa I was given barely covered the contents of the bowl. The food itself tastes absolutely amazing - I will not deny that... but for the portion size, and the price - I might be considering my future lunch options."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best street tacos I've ever had. This place is on point! We had their Green Chile Wet Burrito and their Carne and Barbacoa tacos. The only complaint I have is that I wished my stomach was bigger! So delicioso!!!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Get the street tacos quesadilla style with cheese in the middle, amazing! Tastes just like the street tacos in Mexico, I definitely recommend the carnitas and asada"}
{"text":"Took a friend from Canada here last night.  When we arrived, there was no line, and no hostess.  There was another woman employee on her cell phone, texting. After waiting for 4 or 5 minutes without being acknowledged, I asked the woman if we could seat ourselves.  She sneered \"no\" and continued texting.  Another very nice waitress came over and eventually got us situated at a little table on the patio. Service was good from then on, food was fine, drinks were fine.  A-ok."}
{"text":"The place is not very impressive, just a small space in a strip mall, but the food was fantastic! I tried barbacoa, carnitas, and carne asada tacos - all were good but the carne asada was my least favorite. There are several options for topping your burritos and tacos, very similar to Chipotle. They also have a small salsa bar with fresh lime wedges, which was a nice touch. I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sombrero's a couple of times and enjoyed it immensely.  So much so that  I am picking up food to take home for my family today. Their red chile pork is amazing and the chile diablo salsa is so yummy!  The corn shell tacos are my first pick and their jalepeno cream cheese is a nice addition if you MUST have additional dairy (although not typical mexican style to do so).   I would love to try their nachos but can't seem to steer away from the tacos.  Side note - if you can't find their sign, it's under the Taqueria store front! They really do need to get signage out there. I have been to this center many times and until i read YELP I wouldn't have known it was there. Glad I found them. My husband is too!"}
{"text":"This place is legit, flavor! Got the Wet Carne Asada burrito and it is great. The enchilada sauce has some kick so if you're not a spicy food person maybe pass on the wet style. You add whatever you want \"chipotle\" style and they grill your meat after you order ensuring the just made taste. First time visit but I'll DEF be back. Nice Job Mucha Lucha"}
{"text":"So good and so fresh. Juicy but not greasy. Drove here from south Chandler. Will be my new destination spot since there's so much more on the menu I want to try. Today was the 3 Tacodilla plate. Awesome."}
{"text":"A little low rent for my taste, but the food is really good.  Hard to order sometimes because I don't speak Spanish.  I might say what's in the meat lovers tacos?... Too late I guess I'm getting them now.  Oh well they were good but I prefer the 3 flour tacos so you can mix and match different meats. If you get carne asada say ranchero style... that worked out really good.  I also really like the red chili carnitas, barbacoa beef and green chilie beef.  Oh and if you mix and match meats in the tacos don't try to mix seafood with landfood that blows their mind, it's either surf or turf there will be no mixing.  I'll let you know when I figure out how to try the shrimp tacos :-)"}
{"text":"Heard from a friend  about a new taco shop in town  . Wow..... I love the food  Great flavor with just the right amount of spice  . I'm a big guy  breakfast burrito  the best... I recommend 5 stars   . Tony p."}
{"text":"Great little addition to the restaurants in Fountain Hills! Compared to the other Mexican food options in town, this one is a little more authentic in spices and flavor -- if you like spicy, this is the place for you! Price is reasonable, staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"i normally hated mexican food in the past.  quite by accident, the line at the fast food next door was too long and my lunch hour was quickly fleeting - since I was hungry, I thought I'd stop in and atleast buy some sustanence so I could make it thru the day.  the food was absolutely the best and now the only mexican restaurant that I frequent at all.   this is a 5 star restaurant with 1 star quality prices.  great value & taste - I hightly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great tacos. Rather new location , so it was pretty hectic when we were there. Thumbs way up."}
{"text":"Cool environment. The food is even better than I expected. Highly recommend! I got the shrimp tacos... So good. Very cool artwork through the restaurant."}
{"text":"The carne asada wet burrito was really good, the red sauce on top of the burrito was a little spicy, but delicious. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, but not better than my homemade. :(  Service: good Cleanliness: good Food: good I don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I got the 7 street tacos. It was very tasty very tender. Obviously made Fresh for each order.  The staff is extremely friendly and kind.  I would 100% go back."}
{"text":"Local gem!  This eatery is set up cantina style, similar to a national chain of the same type of food but oh, so much better.  After reviewing the menu on the wall, you order at the counter, select entree w/ various choices of tortilla/meat/condiments and take it to your table.     The meat choices were vast - chicken, beef in various styles will surely meet all palates.  Fresh grilled fish in the street tacos won out!    Service was very friendly - I love a place that inquires sincerely about your experience - and the restaurant was clean.  Pricing is good.  Having eaten Mexican food in many places, I'd recommend this one for being authentic and fresh."}
{"text":"I expected much better based on the reviews.  Got five street tacos and could choose 3 meats.  The meats were OK, but not better than other tacos joints I've tried.  They did put more toppings on.  My colleague found the wrestling themed artwork disturbing, and I was certainly caught by surprise."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. There is not much to the interior or the decor. But the food is fresh and delicious. The lady behind the counter is very nice and always smiling. The prices are average for lunch. The options on the menu are pretty standard for a mexican food place, but the quality of the food is great. I think you could say this place is similar to a Chipotle but the flavors are more authentic and less mass-produced if that makes any sense."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are reviews on her that aren't 5 stars... My last review said some of the best tacos I've ever had but, no, these are clearly the best in Tempe at least... Very Chipotle-like but far more authentic..."}
{"text":"Great food - loved all the choices of fillings!  Super helpful service...decor is pretty \"strip mall\" basic, but all in all a really good, filling lunch!"}
{"text":"Judging from the sandwich board that just says mucha lucha tacos off the street you would not hunk much of this place. But you  I would be wrong. These tacoas are delish. Had the barbacoa, the mole chicken, the spicy pork and the Chile Verde con carne. They where all good and they have a great salsa bar. Their decor is also fascinating with the Lucha theme. Service can be a tad slow during lunch rush but really just cause I am a picky dude and I was in a rush. But I usually go in the afternoon to enjoy these delish street tacos. This joint wins la Lucha!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a tasty Mexican restaurant and we came upon this gem.  It was amazing. The Barbacoa was nice and juicy. I mixed it in with the red chili carnitas and wows air was a taste explosion in my mouth.  Their jalapeño cream dip was so unique and refreshing.  Definitely coming back here again!!"}
{"text":"Had the barbacoa burrito and it was very good. The barbacoa is very tender. They do a great job of draining a lot of the sauce from the beans and meat so it isn't so wet. People there are really nice. Somehow recognized I was a newbie and were genuinely appreciate of me trying them out. Only problem is that it is a small place so I couldn't eat there since not much seating."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada quesadilla with spinach tortilla with a pineapple soda! The meat tastes real (unlike some restaurants) and their prices aren't too expensive, my wife and I both ate plenty and spent under $20... definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Super delicious and inexpensive! I LOVE the green chili. If you like spicy food you will love this. The staff are all very friendly. I love it here."}
{"text":"The tacos are great! The service was lackluster. I can totally get behind a family run business, but the two young girls running the counter need some more training. One was open-mouth chewing gum over my tacos as she put the toppings on. The other completely butchered our order. For fear of causing too much confusion, we hit the bullet and ate what we were given. Again, it was very good. So no complaints on the food taste.   I ordered 3 tacos but was told that \"due to their register\" I could not have 3 different meat selections, only 2.   I've heard great things about Mucha Lucha, but it appears this one might be the black sheep seeing as how they now go by Maskadores. I'll try a different location next time."}
{"text":"I was on a mission to find the best Mexican place in Tempe, and found it! The atmosphere is a perfect Mexican experience, the people are so friendly and fast, and the food is to die for.  I have tried a lot of the things on their menu and have never been disappointed, only pleasantly surprised.  My favorite set up for a guaranteed good night is their two carne asada tostadas with hot salsa (I don't usually like spicy, but their sauce was just too good) with a large horchata. My husband's favorite is their three soft tacos with carne asada and carnitas.  You can tell the owner puts a lot of soul into his food by the way he presents his fresh ingredients, and cooks with style and taste."}
{"text":"This is my go to \"fast food\" Mexican restaurant. The food is always fresh and delicious. My favorite is the chicken  enchilada with green sauce! The tacos are a contender as well."}
{"text":"Have been here twice as i am from out of town. Their 5 street tacos are wonderful!! Get to pick 2 meats and what else you want in mini tacos. You get a total of 10 tortillas, 2 per taco so you can split the ingridients into 2 tacos. You can get them as chile hot as you want."}
{"text":"The tacos here are probably the best ones I've ever had. I usually order the shrimp tacos which have so much flavor, but have tried their tinga chicken which is the perfect amount of spiciness. The carne asada is bomb too. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Holy crap. I'm sitting here in Phoenix, in the middle of summer, eating this spicy-ass burrito. I am sweating like a madwoman and it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Veggie Burrito today. WOW. Great little place, friendly and fun atmosphere.  Great fresh food, and sauces. The salsa bar with jalapeños is nice."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and came here on day 1.  Service and food were fantastic.  We were offered tastes to help us with our selection although we wanted a little of everything we ended up with the street tacos (yum) and the wet burrito (huge and tasty) and the nachos (the works!). We would come back again."}
{"text":"This little place was such a good find and I would recommend to anyone. The staff was friendly and willing to explain the menu. The food was amazing. We ordered the 5 street tacos. There are so many meat options to choice from. We ordered the green chili beef, carne Asada, and the chicken. Soooo good."}
{"text":"Don't pass it by.  If you think \"hole-in-the-wall\" and say, \"I can try that\", please DO!  This place has some excellent food.  Friendly service to go along with it.  Fish tacos, burritos, quesadillas, all good.  Oh, and if you like hot salsa, try the green sauces."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Price is reasonable for the amount of food. And...Oh and yea the food...so tasty! I met the owner, Jaime, and he was one of the most friendliest people I've ever met. I had ordered the mini tacos and they were loaded with the yummiest and freshest ingredients. I enjoy supporting our local businesses so please try this place. Honestly, this restaurant has no room for dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"Mucha Lucha is like Chipotle, if Chipotle was actually authentic and not bland. Best tacos and burritos in Tempe."}
{"text":"11$ for a soggy burrito ,and pretty sure the fish was bad . I'd rather go to chipotle or Filiberto's."}
{"text":"Double carne asada wet burrito, with hot sauce and the jalapeño cream cheese.  Bomb burrito.  Nuff said"}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients and lots of flavor! Whether veggie only or meat, do tacos, burritos and watch the hot sauce."}
{"text":"Had the wet burrito with the red carnitas, fabulous! Lady had the 5 street tacos. The owners were nice enough to let us do five different meats. Can't go wrong with this place"}
{"text":"Had fish tacos plowed through them! This definitely going to be my place for Mexican food from here out!"}
{"text":"If i ever go to a Mexican restaurant, i make sure to order carne asada street tacos (if they have them) and i have yet to try a place that has better carne asada tacos than this place! i always order the 5 street tacos and just ask for cheese, cilantro, white onion, and pico de gallo  on it. they are absolutely delicious, fresh, and super flavorful. The place can be hard to find at first but its a must go. Its also perfect for me since i work in the area and have a short lunch break. Their staff is quick, super welcoming, and overall great!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Nice little place. Isn't fancy schmancy, but the chipotle chicken wet burrito was delicious. I got the red sauce and man was it spicy. Not like obnoxious hot, but like a slow and strong spicy. It was really good but at the end too much for me. Ha ha! I would definitely go back and try their other options. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a nice quick bite to eat. The parking is scarce but was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Awesome food, ambiance, and service. Suggest bandera burrito. Subway style so you can choose fillings/toppings."}
{"text":"Outstanding!! I was very surprised to find this incredible Mexican food in Fountain Hills. The food is some of the best I have had in Arizona and with out a doubt the best value for flavor anywhere north of the border. The staff are wonderful. The owner and her daughters make every meal to order and make every meal special. Gotta try it."}
{"text":"Ordered from grub hub today and worst order ever. My wife's taco had a hair in it and absolutely no toppings that would normally go on fish tacos. The rice and beans came on the side and was not worth the price paid."}
{"text":"Not great, but not bad. I am a self proclaimed mexican food snob. So in order to get above the 3 star level, it has to be good. Not enough happening in the food to do it. Now go get ya some! Yelp on!"}
{"text":"Great food! Stopped in on a layover at the airport and the food was amazing. It was a short cab ride, and I see why this is the highest rated Mexican place in the area. I got the wet burrito burrito and my friend got the flour tacos. Good variety of meats and toppings to dress up your food. Excellent prices and a friendly staff.  PS the Luchador theme inside is super cool!"}
{"text":"1 year later, and this place is still as good as it gets for Mexican food. I seem to like it more, the more I eat here.  Everything is freshly prepared and there's a lot of variety for a small hole in the wall. There are 5-6 salsas to go with the chips they give with every order or to use on the burrito. One time they were out of my favorite sauce and I asked if they had more in the back. The guy behind the counter said he'd make some more. About 5 minutes later he came out with a freshly blended batch... it was amazing as always.  $7.50 will buy you a burrito, and it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is 100x better than filibertos or any of those chains. It competes with most restaurants! It's authentic and delicious!Love their carne asada. The horchata is amazing this is the only place I'll buy it in az as they actually make it fresh! No powder!!! Try it and you'll crave it!"}
{"text":"First tried this place in Tempe and loved it! I was really excited to see it moved up the street. Food was still good but I'm extremely disappointed you can't order tacos a la carte like the other locations offer. With kids you don't need an additional five tacos, it'd be nice if they could add the a la carte option per taco or add a kids menu."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! All the meats are delicious and the green salsa from the little salsa bar is so spicy but addicting!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally visited today for lunch. We found the food authentic and full of flavor. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and they were kind enough to invite us in despite it being just after closing time. While it probably isn't ok to expect that all the time, it's still nice to know there are awesome ppl out there."}
{"text":"I found my spot!! I eat fish tacos/ street tacos and nachos across the U.S. and never have I seen a Taqueria set up like a Subway. Choose my toppings for my tacos and nachos? I don't mind if I do, thank you.   Chipotle? Nah that's a burrito joint and I don't do burritos. Man this Tokyo Drift movie is corny AF. I can't believe they made 7 of these POS. Sorry, laying down on the couch knocked out from the 5 street fish tacos and 1/2 a nacho. Next week I'm just doing the 5 tacos or just the Super Nacho. The service was fast and friendly and the sauces were fantastic. 5 stars no doubt. I gotta try and get up and change the channel. Tough tho. Taco Coma."}
{"text":"It shouldn't be $9 for a green chilli beef taco salad that has A HALF CUP OR EVEN 1/4 CUP of meat. And the overweight lady should fix her attitude and be more pleasant when serving customers. She gave me a stink eye as soon as she realized I didn't speak Spanish. The cashier and the small lady kept smiling and were courteous she could have at least fakes it like they did. Smh, that lady was a real b!tch. Sorry Mucha Lucha get it together so people don't leave upset when buying your overpriced food."}
{"text":"Awesome food and good service!!!  The carne asada Street tacos are awesome.  Awesome for a lunch spot."}
{"text":"Amazing Taco Salad and burrito bowl! Everything was so fresh with the perfect amount of spicy! Try the Jalapeño cream cheese- to die for! We live across the street and will be back! I've seen the one in Tempe and have always wanted to go, but I'm so glad this one is half a minute away! Check out their Tempe page for more reviews. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Yep another five for the work 'hood. I drove past this place many times and never, ever would think of stopping in. Thank goodness for my fellow yelpers showing me the way...  Tiny place in a tight, old, somewhat run down strip mall. Minimal parking. Tiny restaurant with maybe 8 tables? And yes two HUGE TVs on either wall loud and proud on a news station - I'm not sure if it was Fox. My first visit was during the noon hour and there was a line. People ordering off of lists for lots of other work folks but it's simple ordering and they are fast.   I listened to what the pros were ordering and everything sounds great. When it was my turn I asked for an 'Open Burrito' not really sure what that was. She grabbed a bowl and asked if I wanted rice, No, beans? Yes, black or pinto? Black. What kind of meat (which later my husband reminded me was Friday during lent whoops) I asked her to describe everything she had - chicken, red pork, green extra spicy, - she had me at extra spicy so I didn't listen to the rest - then the fun stuff - cilantro, cheese, ROASTED CORN, guacamole, sour cream, onions, yes, yes, yes!  Do you want a tortilla? Spinach, plain, Chipotle - yes that. Then they had a side bar with more chile sauces, limes, onions, jalapeños, I got limes and red chile.   About $7+ dollars later I walked back to work with my bowl. It was amazing, fresh, perfectly cooked meat, super spicy and flavorful. All the extras made it incredible. I decided this is where I'm spending my one day out at lunch until further notice. And I can walk.   I wanted to immediately write a review but I made myself go a second time to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Today was my second visit - fantastic! And I love the staff, so friendly, happy to explain the food. The place is clean very deceptive from the exterior.   One of my new favs!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food. I Recommend the asada street tacos. Price is good to. 5 tacos for $7."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious, and they gave us samples of all of their meat! The spicy ones were incredible PLUS they had tons of salsas, delicious lime-y rice, and warm tortillas. Fantastic joint!"}
{"text":"Great service. Fresh food. Can't wait to go back. I had their shrimp tacos and they were cooked fresh to order and we're mouth watering delicious. Their churros are stuffed with a sauce that is absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous. Will come back again. Atmosphere is casual. Watch them work their magic with your order. Once we figured out the menu it was clear sailing ."}
{"text":"Loved tacos. Tried beef and pork and chicken.  Beef and pork great, chicken was good not great."}
{"text":"I love going here for street tacos, the red carnitas are the best of all of their meats but that's just my opinion. Gets crowded during lunch and not a great place for a large group just because of the dining area."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this after seeing all the great reviews. So , today I headed over.  It smelled funny when I walked in. Nothing is labeled and no one bothered to explain the menu. I ended ordering something I didn't want because there was no explanation of the menu items and no one working spoke English well enough to have a conversation with.  FYI- if you go here go with someone who understands the menu to guide you.  I was a little worried that I made a huge mistake, but despite not ordering correctly, the food was very good.  It gets two stars for poor service and lack of product labeling.  I'm not psychic if you don't label the menu and the salsa how am I to know what's spicy and what's not.   I ordered meat lovers tacos-FYI no choice of meat with that. When I tried to ask about making a selection the service person looked at me like I was a stupid gringa. Next; Chips and salsa but if you want a mild salsa you have to play go fish nothing is labeled.  I am not inclined to visit this place again."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food at a decent price. I had the street tacos and the serving was more than enough for me. It tasted good and the price was decent. I will come back this place for the food and the service. :)"}
{"text":"This place has some great flavor and authentic tastes opposed to the chipotle option. If you're looking for something not super busy like chipotle's lunch hour come here and enjoy some good eats!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Mexican restaurant that I have been to in a long time.  Why haven't we known about this joint before???  They have 6 types of meat chicken, carne asado, green chili pork, regular pork, red pork and barbacoa.  You pick your meat. They make their own retried beans!  Take the pintos and mash them.  We had tostadas with the pork and green chili pork they both came with the mashed pintos   Very good.  Got the carne asado quesadilla. It was so good.  Got 3 street tacos and 3 hard tacos.  The tacos are a great deal.  $.99 a piece or the meal with a drink for $3.99.  Salsas are great and the gauc is the real deal.   We will be going back!   So good and fresh!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! This place has a fun and intimate atmosphere. There isn't a lot of seating inside but the food is very good."}
{"text":"Small little place next to Subway. Get there early, it was quite busy when we were there.  I saw a lot of people took their order to go as there isn't many tables to dine in.  Food was good, prices were okay."}
{"text":"I was craving for a place with really good tacos and Sombreros came through!! I got 3 flour tortillas tacos with barbacoa and one with chile verde and they were soooo damn tasty!. The pico de Gallo was surprisingly spicy but its because they make it right. I'm taking a bus load of people with me next time!!!"}
{"text":"Super affordable with a cool vibe (hand drawn Lucha Libre characters) but the street tacos didn't blow me away.  The chips were a bit stale.  Solid place though."}
{"text":"This is now my new favorite place in Tempe! It is quick, cheap and delicious! My husband and I were looking for some quick Mexican food and decided to give it a try. We were promptly greeted and asked if we had been there before. Once we said now we were handed tons of samples and thoroughly explained the menu to us. Man, it was hard to choose because they have so many meet options and they all tasted so good. I went with the green chili pork and my husband went with steak. Both were ridiculous! I love how they have healthy options too like wheat tortillas and black beans. The jalapeño cream cheese was also very good. I'd love to smother that all over a bagel in the morning. Try this place people! You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"This is truly one of the BEST taco shops I've been too in a very long time.  It's definitely in my top 5! Their spicy beef was off the charts with flavor and was extreme tender and juicy.  Their variety of toppings and condiments were like a symphony of delicious flavors and textures which complimented my tacos perfectly.  I'll definitely be back for more......"}
{"text":"Bomb! Can be compared to Chipotle, simply better and cheaper. Super quick, super fresh ingredients. Really love the red chili pork/beef."}
{"text":"The food is worth every penny. Think the speed of Taco Bell and the customization of Chipotle and that's Sombrero's. Throw in a friendly staff and now I'm officially a fan. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"First time here and it was everything I expected!  We meet the owner, young gentlemen with great sense of humor and staff was very friendly, we ordered the 5 street tacos and macho fries. Tacos were so tasty! and fries huge! Salsas were amazing and hot!  Loved the decore and feel of the place. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Go to your fridge and throw out all of your your food, because unless you can make food as good as Mucha Lucha, you're wasting your time. Burritos just like your Abuela used to make them.  Get the breakfast burrito with Tinga chicken, and prepare for an out of body experience."}
{"text":"First time visiting today - shrimp street tacos were awesome.  There was a line as other reviewers had mentioned for lunch - so FYI. It's dangerous that this place is so close to work.  Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Arizona! Service was amazing too!  We were visiting from Texas for baseball."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Best Mexican in Tempe, highly recommend the meat lovers street tacos with the white jalapeño cream sauce"}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place because of all the great reviews! I finally made it in for lunch. The lunch rush must of ended because all the items were not replenished. I usually like my burrito with double rice (rice was okay) no beans and she only gave me a scoop of rice. I wanted to try the green chili beef and only gave me a 1/4 cup serving of it since she had to measure it with a spoon. I'm reading all these awesome reviews about a huge burrito and I felt like I just got scammed. The worst was their tortilla. It tasted like rubber and not fresh. I guess I'll have to try them again on their street tacos instead of their burritos."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the owner customized the burrito and quesadilla for our vegetarian family. All of us enjoyed the food and the wet burrito was spicy, but we couldn't resist and had to finish it."}
{"text":"Food delicious and friendly service. Best carne Asada ever. The jalapeño sour creme adds just the right amount of spice. Chipotle chicken full of flavor. Decor is different and memorable. Will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great place for authentic tacos, burritos, nachos, etc! Came back here a 2nd time on our vaca since we were sure no one could deliver as quality food for such low cost.  Definitely recommend the carne asada tacos!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Fresh, authentic (I think) food.  Owners and staff are incredibly friendly. This is our go-to whenever we have visitors.   Street tacos are my favorite."}
{"text":"Definitely my new taco spot  It was my first time here and will be back for sure (: Cannot go wrong with getting tacos from here. I had the street tacos de asada. The meat was well seasoned and the salsa was perfect ! Give this place a try will not regret it !!"}
{"text":"This place would have gotten more stars from me were it not for the cross contamination issue. I ordered a carne asada burrito but they made a mistake and put my friend's chicken on it. When I pointed that out, they scraped the chicken off of my burrito and put it back on the grill. I was astonished. Seriously?! My friend pointed out that it was good that she wasn't allergic to anything in my burrito. They also use the same hand to pick up all the items to place on the burrito. Now, I'm not allergic to any food items but that might be a concern for someone who is. The burrito was actually decent and big but the lack of concern in terms of food safety is just a no no for me. I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for authentic food! Well worth finding."}
{"text":"Customer service was top notch! The guy helping us was kind and knowledgeable. Food was amazing. Ive been wanting some street tacos for a while and my hubby has been craving a chimichanga. So when our daughter continued to ask for tacos every 5 minutes, we decided to give Maskadores a try. They did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I ever had! On the spicy side (which I love), ask the ladies for help if you cannot handle too much spice. I'll be back to try the other menu items. Cool theme and great new spot for Tempe."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best, authentic Mexican food around!  They are from Mexico City!  Very nice friendly people!  They aim to please!!!"}
{"text":"Best Secret in town. Everyone get over there. Support Maskadores Taco Shop!   Fresh ingredients, friendly, family service. Varied menu, breakfast all day.  Easy to grab to-go quickly. Or sit back and enjoy a margarita, craft beer.  Casual friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time in here was not a good experience. Last night, was completely different and I am glad I decided to give another chance. Both ladies in front very sweet and great customer service. The street tacos were amazing as well as the burrito bowl. Carne asada has a lot of flavor. I am not a fan of their beans at all but I am not big on ranch or black beans. Everything else was phenomenal and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great tacos.  People exceptionally friendly and helpful.  They also have burritos and other items.  A full bar is also part a feature.  I'll make it a regular fast food stop."}
{"text":"Omg this is like Polibertos and Chipotle wrapped in one. Words can't explain how much i love this place. Beware of the red sauce it's hottttt.."}
{"text":"Looking for something new to try in Fountain Hills. Maskadores has become my new \"go to\" Mexican food restaurant. Very original and high Quality food. I had a burrito and found it to be outstanding. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Sort of a hole in the wall, but probably the best Mexican I've had in a long time! Fresh high grade carne asada, tender chicken and a ton of different salsas. Cream-filled churro with caramel sauce was a must-have treat. The staff were extremely friendly and all about customer service. Reminded me of Tia Garcia's home cooking!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! It's like the original, authentic version of Chipotle."}
{"text":"I had the 5 tacos. I asked for 2 asada, 2 barbacoa and 1 pork. The asada and pork tacos were good. The barbacoa tacos were not. I did not like the flavor, I only took one bite of a taco and I was unable to eat them. I also tried the barbacoa by itself and the flavor was not there. The barbacoa seemed to be on the sweet side and the juice was more on the orange side. Some people may like this, however, this was not appetizing to me. I am used to having barbacoa that is a little spicy and red. The tacos were a good size and had a good price. You chose the ingredients and have to pay extra for guacamole. To drink, I had an horchata, it was good! If I went back, I'd have the asada and pork tacos again. My relatives liked their tacos. They had asada and chicken."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the finest places in Arizona, it is real authentic Mexican food. The food is absolutely delicious but the customer service is better. The minute you walk in it is very uplifting, from the food to the to the customer service is, it is excellent. Wish it wish bigger so it can fit more people but that doesn't stop it from being one of the finest restaurants in Arizona. Everyone behind that counter is hardworking and try and make your meal the best they can, whether it's your first time or two hundredth time. Quality over quantity! If traveling I highly recommend checking this place out, not many out there like this."}
{"text":"The wet burrito sauce is surprising spicy, but very good.  My husband had the street tacos and said the Carne Asada was the best!"}
{"text":"Very authentic, fresh, and delicious! However be careful with the salsas, they are hot! I will surely come back"}
{"text":"Great Street tacos! However, I didn't care much for the beans. The woman at register was very nice. The lady that was helping with preparing orders had horrible customer service. Prices are not that bad at all."}
{"text":"Why 4 stars? Because it was a solid backup plan.     ---   ---   ---  I have a confession: I did not intend to visit Maskadores. I had it all mapped out - I was going to land, grab my rental car, and head to Little Miss BBQ, which recently was named the #2 restaurant in the U.S. on Yelp.   And then I got to the Little Miss BBQ and they had no parking spots left + an hour and a half wait, which I just couldn't make work. It was a very sad day, but the consolation is that it led me to Maskadores.  Though I was devastated to miss out on this meal I'd looked forward to for weeks, I pulled over into some random parking lot and asked myself, \"Self, what are you in the mood for?\" And because I was in Arizona after all, I decided to Yelp the best Mexican around. Maskadores had great reviews and was close by, so the decision was made pretty quickly!  The line wasn't super long, but it moved slowly, so I had plenty of time to decide on what I wanted. The wet burrito seemed to be the consensus as the top item to order, so that was my plan. There were two different kinds of wet burritos, so I asked for clarification on what a Bandera Wet Burrito was. It turned out that some of the sauce poured on top of the bandera was really spicy, so I asked for jus the regular wet burrito instead.  Unfortunately, it was hard to hear each other and it seemed that the level of English spoken was minimal, so she thought I asked for a (dry) burrito. I normally would have asked them to re-do it, but I was running late for where I needed to be, so I just let it be.  The burrito was solid, but it also didn't taste a ton different than what I could have gotten from Chipotle. Don't get me wrong, I love Chipotle, but I was hoping for something a bit unique while in a new place.  So that was my Maskadores experience. It hit the spot, but just not quite a home run."}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty, and fresh Mexican food.  They have several different types of fillings; barbacoa, green chile beef, red chile pork, carnitas, two chickens, and carne asada, as well as black and pinto beans, fresh guacamole, and salsa that will take the skin off the inside of your mouth (this is a good thing).  And the burritos are the size of my head.  Very hard to beat for the price."}
{"text":"Awesome little taco shop serving up great tacos, burritos and more.  I prefer the \"wet\" burrito over a normal burrito. Try the fish or shrimp tacos, too! Some of their stuff is super-spicy so be careful if you can't handle the heat! Decent beers, good margaritas and really nice people working there. This place is a great addition to our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very happy with out meal(s) here. We went to both locations during our week in Arizona. Street tacos were great as was the burrito (huge). I don't think one of the locations is licensed, so if you want a drink you may want to check that out."}
{"text":"Very fresh tasting, excellent food.  Had street tacos (carnitas, green chile pork, pollo), sopes (fully loaded), and shrimp baja burrito. Nothing was greasy or heavy, and portions were just right, and the decor was cool to top it all off."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this new taco shop a few weeks ago.  I would have reviewed sooner but it's taken this long for my mouth to cool off. (JK)   I ordered three tacos; a carnitas, a red chili beef and a tomatilla beef.  The person behind the counter said the red chili was kind of hot, but I don't generally have a problem with spicy Mexican food so I went with it.  You should be hearing the theme from \"Jaws\" right now, but I'll go into that later.  I thought the ordering process was confusing.  As someone else mentioned it's kind of like Chipotle where you add things as they move your order along.  There were a bunch of toppings, but no indication of whether or not things like the guacamole were an additional cost or not.  I opted for what I figured was sour cream in a squeeze bottle and got a quick zig zag of that on each taco (not nearly enough).  We got margaritas, and while it took some time to get them, they were good.  Back to the food...I tried the first taco.  Looking back, I'm not sure why I continued to eat it.  It was painfully hot.  PAINFULLY HOT.  The kind of hot where the food has no actual taste because the flavor has been burned out of it.  I looked at my husband and he was experiencing the same problem with his dish.  We soldiered on thinking it might get better. My second and third tacos were not as incendiary as the first, but at that point my mouth hurt so much it was impossible to taste anything.  My husband was scraping the chili off his enchiladas to try to finish them.   I feel compelled to say that both of us have lived in Phoenix since high school.  We love Mexican food.  We always order the special salsa at our favorite restaurant in Flagstaff and that can be pretty hot depending on the day.  I have a jalapeno plant in my garden for heaven's sake.  What we don't like is pain, and our meals caused physical pain.  It felt like the inside of my mouth was blistered, although it probably wasn't.  We walked out of there in shock.   So here's the thing...most of these reviews are very positive.  I don't know what they ate.  We, however, won't be back.  I would rather my food have flavor and the flavor was buried under the heat at Maskadores."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in years, maybe ever. No BS.   Home made tortillas, lots of meat choices, not just chicken or beef.... If you like it spicy  this is the place.  The red pork carnitas are amazing. They even have gre"}
{"text":"The Best Mexican food you're going to get for 20 miles, regardless of price. The food is affordable yet extremely flavorful. It's not a sit down restaurant, so don't expect that, it's tacos and burritos with pickled red onions, house roasted corn treks and Chipotle cream. It's really good, trust me."}
{"text":"We stopped in for supper and ordered tacos.  Absolutely delish!  Everything was very fresh and wonderfully seasoned.  They're not afraid of spice -- yay!  Unfortunately, the food contains quite a bit of salt and, since we're both on low sodium diet, we won't be able to eat there again.  But for folks who don't have sodium restriction, we would highly recommend Mucha Lucha."}
{"text":"The staff is super patient and kind. This is \"Chipotle style dining\" but it is better by every dimension: Taste, assortment, price, hello - full bar, and atmosphere. It's casual, fun dining. A place worth coming back to."}
{"text":"Dankest Mexican food in Tempe and cheap as well! The guys inside hook it up! Carne Asada street tacos for daysss"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time coming here and both times I have had some of the best tacos I have ever had in my life.. And I've had some delicious tacos from around the valley. The staff is very welcoming and warm, Samantha even took a few mins out of her busy day to talk with me about the history of this great establishment. This is by no means the fanciest taco shop in town, but you can taste the passion in the recipes. Be prepared for a little bit of a line and little seating options during lunch, which lets be honest, is usually a great sign of a business. I highly recommend stopping by when you are around here."}
{"text":"Very good place to get some silver dollar carne asada, pollo (3 different kinds!), and carnitas tacos. It was solid but maybe not extraordinary. You can choose your toppings like onions, cilantro, corn and red onions along with the jalapeño fixins bar. Warning: the salsa bar is red hot! Oh man I had a flight the next day and my innards were feeling the Bern (that's a nod to Bernie's last stand in NY yesterday).  I may have been able to handle it in my 20s, but not anymore! Watch out especially for the avocado salsa -- looks innocent but it is wicked."}
{"text":"Delicious, friendly, and a great value! I have had the chicken, carne asada, and vegetarian options. The burritos are hefty and filling! I got tacos once and definitely less bang for your buck...  They have great options, including flavored tortillas and a million different kinds of meat. The ingredients seem very fresh! My husband and I are recently on a plant-based kick and decent choices there as well. The service is always friendly and best of all we can actually get a very filling meal for two for under $12!"}
{"text":"I had the super nachos and the bandera wet burrito it was great. I added jalapenos that really helped with my sinus."}
{"text":"This place has GREAT FOOD!! I had the 5 street tacos. Soooooo good. The Chipotle Chicken is a bit spicy, but I expected this and was warned ahead of time.  My boys had  Tostadas and hard shell tacos. Equally as delicious. The meats are all so delicious. They have a Tacodilla on the menu. That thing looks like it will be awesome as well.  Air Conditioner isnt the best inside the restaurant. It was 110 outside and probably 85-90 inside the restaurant. Im not really complaining though since the food was so worth it!"}
{"text":"So happy I found this taco shop. Chipotle style set up, but even better!! Food & service was great! Vegetarian/vegan options too. New go-to spot for tacos."}
{"text":"We're here thanks to Yelp! Yum! Upbeat casual place!  Order at counter and watch your order be created!  People in front of us did the burrito bowl and 2 burritos!  Looked delicious but too much for us wanting a light lunch!  We split the 2 tostadas: mine with chicken and guacamole, hubby had beef barbacoa/guacamole/sr cream/etc.  Ssoo Good!!!  We'll be back another time for one of those burritos for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Best taqueria in Fountain Hills, hands down!  I've been there three times now, and have never been disappointed.  For me, it's all about the tacos.  Their carne asada is the best in town.  Perfect seasoning, texture, and taste.  The red carnitas and the green chili beef have amazing and complex levels of flavor and heat.  I go out of my way, past two other taco shops, to get Mucha Lucha."}
{"text":"This place is a GEM!!! As soon as you walk in you're enveloped with the smells of homemade Chile Verde sauce, handmade corn tortillas and cilantro that every taco shop shoild hope to smell like.  From there you can pick out 5 of their best tacos for $7.50... $7.50!!! For a taste that took me back to when I'd drive from San Diego to Tijauna just for the authentic experience of a proper Mexican street taco.  I'll be back on a weekly basis!! Super friendly staff that was helpful and accommodating made it even that much better."}
{"text":"This place is very good for quick Mexican food.  My family and I all ordered burritos which were delicious (veggie, beans and rice, and a chili verde beef).  The service was friendly and helpful.  We'll be coming here again the next time we're in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The staff is very friendly, the walls are painted in a graffiti fashion. We got the street tacos. They were great! Price is right. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Fresh food but SPICY!  I have lived here for almost 20 years, love Mexican food, but now have met my match with this green and red sauce.  Their wet burrito was so large that I could make two meals out of it. The  carne asada beef was tender and had a  delicious flavor but I had to scrape off the red and green sauce to even taste the  entree.  We're talking..... BURNING hot.  Don't misunderstand me, I like hot, especially when  enjoying Mexican food but this was SCORCHING!!!  So much that my company we're searching for some type of dairy product for me to put out the flames!  The margarita was true tasting and not sweet but didn't help the inferno.  I was  unable to taste anything due to the fire in my mouth.  After a second round of scraping,  the burning had calmed down to just the nice heat from the marinaded meat.  I then, was able to enjoy my inaugural wet burrito from Maskadores ."}
{"text":"Great food! Had carne asada, pastor and many other tacos and burritos amongst our group. The food amd service was excellent! Glad we visited and lucky we found this place."}
{"text":"I walked in to this place with a co worker and it is small, located in a strip mall.  I was offended that on the two walls were big flat screen tvs blaring Fox News Channel, loud and annoying.  I asked if they could turn the channel and was told no. that they can't.. I tried to turn the channel myself or even to turn down the volume and it was locked down.. so I turned off both tvs.  The food was average, I don't really understand the hype about the food, there are plenty of Mexican restaurants in the area that don't have a political agenda.    No thanks, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Flavorful and fresh food always. The service is consistent and the place is always clean. Their menu selection includes street tacos and the wet banderas burrito which is my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after seeing the reviews. Unfortunately this place was a real let down. The best thing about this place was the corn tortillas for the street tacos. Service was friendly. Ordered the tinga, viniargretta, and carnitas. All bland and nothing special. Salsa's ranged from very hot to hot. Most were hot without any flavor. We won't be back as there are better options with more flavorful protein and salsas to choose from."}
{"text":"One of the best place in Tempe! The food is really good and they have different meats to choose from. I love getting the burrito bowl. It reminds me of Chipotle  but with way more flavors!"}
{"text":"What a find! This taco shop offers bowls, burritos, and of course tacos! I opted for the bandero wet burrito and was not disappointed. The meat was grilled right in front of me, I was able to choose as many fresh toppings as I wanted. And they even have a sauce station for your tacos, but I used it for my burrito.   In short great place, friendly staff, and decent prices."}
{"text":"Decent taste. Sloppy handling of food. Same price if you eat meat or not . No Mexican agua frescas. Slightly Higher priced than average."}
{"text":"Place is very good, got the super nachos and was a great spice to it and very good portion for a great price! You will leave full when you're finished! Could use a bigger parking lot though! Almost hit someone leaving with the small entrances!"}
{"text":"This place is tasty and not to damaging to the wallet. Good portions. The only thing that is negative is that there is a slight language barrier. However, this might be a good thing - if they speak Spanish and are making Spanish food, maybe that means it is more authentic. That is up for you to decide.  I ordered the 5 street tacos (3 different flavors) which were great."}
{"text":"So pumped to find a place that has street tacos and their meat/sauces actually have a spicy kick! I piled on the green sauce without tasting it first, expecting the same ol' bland, which promptly gave me the hiccups! So glad I had already gotten one of the draft Modelo Negras to wash it all down. Asada Ranchero is boss and the tinga chicken has great flavor. Love this place and will be back."}
{"text":"This is *hands down* my favorite Mexican food I've come across in Tempe. The staff is extremely friendly and pleasant, the place is clean, and there is usually a good crowd but never a long wait.   I've ordered the asada burrito each time I've gone. It's too good not to get!   Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"By far, some of the best Mexican food we have ever had!  All 5 of us agreed...only wish we had discovered it before our last night in town. Similar ordering style to chipotle but more options. You sort of build your own. Our group tried a variety of items. ALL delicious, fresh, intense, yummy flavors, authentic. Super friendly staff. NOTE: they DO serve alcohol. At least beer and margaritas. The info on yelp states they do not serve alcohol (which is probably why our group didn't want to try it.). We were pleasantly surprised that they did - who doesn't love a margarita or cerveza with their Mexican?  Not the best margarita ever, but the food well made up for it!  We will be frequent patrons on our next visit to fountain hills. Go, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Visited this little shop for our last lunch before heading to the airport and I'm so glad we did.  The street tacos were so good and filling. Highly recommend the chicken tinga and don't miss the salsa bar.   The restaurant is in a strip mall, no frills, order at the counter, and still a little cute/fun/funky in its own way - definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Lunch was phenomenal and the ladies were amazing and smiley:) I highly recommend the tostadoas!! And the yummy Mexican drink!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Fanstastic street tacos! Will definitely come here again when in town. My son had the wet burrito and loved it. Also really nice people that work there."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town!! Highly recommend checking this place out. So glad they opened one up near us!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down MY favorite tacos spots. I literally refuse to go anywhere else. My go to is either the street tacos or shrimp tacos WITH jalapeño cream cheese and limes!!"}
{"text":"This place is super good!!  First of all, the quality and quantity of food they serve is huge! (Which I don't mind at all)  Everything is made fresh with a great selection of spicy and non spicy salsas.  I tried the carnitas burrito, and it was amazing. Definitely going back to try everything else from the menu.   They also have breakfast food. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food, loved the Lucha Libre decor as i'm an old school wrestling fan.  I tried the street tacos, red chicken and Carne Asada, both meats were very tasty.  The only complaint i have is that the shop is a little small, i went right at noon during the lunch rush and it was a bit of a mad house, however, that did not ruin my experience at all, and the line moved fast considering that they were prepping each meal as it was ordered.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had the Carne Asada street taco (5) plate with onions, cilantro and a squirt of lime. PERFECT! Five tacos may sound like a lot but my husband and I split another plate it was just that good"}
{"text":"Pretty good food!  Wasn't busy when I went in on Saturday. Price point is a little higher than other places in the area."}
{"text":"Tonight I tried for the first time Sombrero's and it was amazing! I got the meat quesadilla with asada it was soo yummy! I tried it with some of the guacamole, sour creme and jalapeño creme cheese, needless to say it was worth the heart burn!   My mom got the 3 soft tacos with the carnitas. She says it's delicious with the jalapeño creme cheese and spicy sauce. What she's ranting and raving about is the horchata. She says that it tastes like vanilla ice cream but melted haha. I tried a taste and I thought it tasted like a shake. She wishes that she had more because she finished it before we even got home and we only live down the street. I also want to add that the family that runs it so nice and friendly.   We will definitely be back. Next time is burritos!"}
{"text":"Incredible tacos. Unreal flavor. Cool little vibe inside too. We had the shrimp flour tacos and the chorizada shrimp tacos and both were loaded with flavor! First time here and from out of town - wish we had a place like this close to home!"}
{"text":"Started going to this location (and loving it!) back when it was Sombreros Taqueria (I think that was the name). Now that I work nearby again it's back to the top of my lunchtime favorites!"}
{"text":"This is one of 3 nearby locations to my work and they're all GREAT! Probably my favorite fast food Mexican restaurant (all locations, not necessarily just this one)."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food and very friendly staff. The best guacamole around. Large variety of different items and the staff will make you something off the menu if you ask about it"}
{"text":"The BEST place for authentic Mexican food! We always come here when visiting from Tucson. Love the four street tacos; barbacoa beef is always juicy and tender and the red Chile carnitas are perfect. The churros are a MUST-HAVE! Wish there was a Sombrero's in Tucson :)"}
{"text":"What can I say, but wow! As a Southern California native, I've had good Mexican food, but this place takes the cake. The Bandera Wet Burrito is to die for. Huge portions, good atmosphere, friendly staff. Do yourself a favor and stop in for lunch."}
{"text":"I don't know if I have encountered a taqueria with such an emphasis on fresh, quality ingredients. I grew up in the Southern California. I have lived in Oaxaca, the Monterey Bay and Arizona so, needless to say, I have eaten a lot of very incredible Mexican food. Today I ate a burrito that got me excited. We just happened upon Sombreros on our way to a spring training baseball game and man we were glad we did. It was incredibly delicious, reasonably priced and very high quality. The service was fantastic and I really enjoyed the decor. TEN OUT OF TEN!! I had the carne asada and my wife had the chicken tinga. Both were great. We will be back."}
{"text":"I always get nervous when I eat Mexican food outside of Southern California.  I know, I am one of those people.  This place has some good tacos worth eating.  Service was great and they were really nice.  I got the 5 street tacos and it was enough and filled me up.  I wish I could have tried 5 different meats but it was ok, I tried two."}
{"text":"Great addition to south Tempe, full bar, and amazing tacos. Finally a place in south Tempe with flavorful spicy Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great little place (hidden gem), a build your own style with tons of toppings and salsas.  Try the surf and turf, carne asada is great and they cook it fresh on the grill after you choose your meat. Great selection overall and quality overall.  Expect long lines around lunch time, I would get there early if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Awesome food, even better decor. I got the burrito bowl and it was amazing. My son got the 3 flour tacos. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"UhhhhhMAZING!! We flew in for our annual trip home from GA and were searching for the coveted cows tongue tacos. We were told they did not have them, but on the way out the door the owner said \"wait!! Try a sample of our meats\". WHOA!! Just beyond! In Tempe, they cater to the college crowd in price only!! The rest of the week I was STILL drooling over the taste of our food!! This impromptu stop left us with a dream for the next visit! Fresh, filling and FABULOUS!! See y'all next year!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Been here a few times and never been disappointed.  Waiters and waitress are great. We sit outside because we have are dog with us.  The food is authentic.  I had sheeded beef tacos and husband had Quesada.  You must give it a try."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food was ok in flavor. This place would actually be good but I'm not sure if the people working are just burnt out or don't care. The reason for the 1 star is not because of the food because it actually tasted good the bad review is on how dirty this place is. If I were an inspector I would have shut the place down. Especially if the front, where your guest eat is that dirty i can't even imagine the back.  The tables were all dirty, the floor was dirty, the counter where they have the salsas was dirty and most of the salsas were all gone and were sitting out there for a long time because the trays were crusted with how dried out the little bit of salsa was. The woman working came and open the little fridge at the bottom and just poured the salsa over it didn't even change out the trays. The little fridge was super dirty. The grill was dirty and they just kept adding more food without really cleaning it from the previous persons food. The area where they keep all the meats and produce was super dirty and when things would fall from one tray to the other it was cleaned up. The restrooms were disgusting and smelled. I would have enjoyed my food if it wasn't to how dirty this place was. They had 4 people working on the grill and not one could come and clean up the tables and floor. They also looked so disorganized and I think it had to do with everyone being in the grill and not really having a specific job. I wish I could say i would give this place another try but unless it is cleaner than this visit, I won't be back."}
{"text":"BY FAR THE MOST AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD IN TEMPE!  YOU MUST GET the soft corn tacos with all the fixings!  a fav of mine is the steak quesadilla so delish.  -6 choices of meats that will wow your taste buds and make you feel like your in baja (:  you will get the best meal under $10"}
{"text":"The biggest wet burrito I have ever had, before warned hot sauce is hot. So be careful on how much sauce you want. Also the sauce was good to."}
{"text":"They no longer put the chicken back on the grill when you order. The chicken is not big chunks of white meat anymore, it is stewed chicken sitting in a broth all day and I'm not even sure it is all white meat anymore. Another issue is the woman who was making the burrito used her gloved hands to fill the burrito with all the toppings. That is fine for rolling, but when your sticking your hand (gloved or not) into each bin of lettuce, corn, tomatoes, cilantro, etc, it just doesn't seem normal. They need to use spoons on thongs for the fillings."}
{"text":"Good quality, but not a great value. Like other restaurants of this style - they skimp on the more expensive ingredients and try to fill you up with the cheap ones. I got a burrito and for $8.00 I received about 3 oz of shredded chicken, a tablespoon of guacamole and tomatoes and lots of beans and rice. Even the amount of tortilla chips I received was skimpy. Their salsa is just okay - very watery. The ambiance is non-existent (dingy) and I don't appreciate restaurants that have the news on when I am trying to eat. The guys behind the counters never asked me how my food was. Overrated and overpriced IMO."}
{"text":"Only one time here so take that for what it's worth. My usual place espos was swamped on taco Tuesday so thought I'd try this place. I was worried when I walked in as was the only customer. The place is new I was told. Employee girl was very nice and helpful. Being a San Diego guy I need the real thing. No Taco Bell or Del Taco EVER. This place delivers. Nice environment, music and good authentic food.  They have several different options of very good Mexican meat.  They have beers on tap and they were talking about a happy hour coming soon with half priced beers. Nice.   Watch out for their hot sauce. It will blow smoke out your ears."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. I got the wet burrito with red sauce and it was amazing. They also let me try this jalapeno cheese sauce.. It was sooo good, I loved it! It's a must try. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"No joke, their food truly is delicious!  We had a family of five and we all ordered something different.   Every one of us loved our dish choice!"}
{"text":"Great find in fountain hills! Salsa can be very hot!   Delicious tacos, interesting atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Fresh chips, super nachos were fabulous! Try the jalapeño cream cheese on everything! Street tacos barbacoa amazing!! Not enough !!  to describe this place. And inexpensive too!!"}
{"text":"I had the honor of being the first customer. Gave them an obligatory first dollar bill!!  These are the best \"street\" tacos ive ever had in Arizona!   There's a reason why mucha lucha is a top ten Taco Shop in the USA!  And today, I found that out for myself!!  I had carne asada street tacos with cilantro pico red onions and salsa.  I also had carnitas which were equally amazing!    REAL SALSA!!!  Omg!  Soo good!!!   I was given about 5 salsas to try and each was amazing. spicy and fresh!   They make a jalapeño cream cheese spread that is pretty awesome as well!  The owner is very friendly and the staff very friendly as well!  I'm so glad to have a place this good so very close to me!"}
{"text":"First time customer. In town on business and ordered the street tacos: tinga chicken, green chile beef and red chili carnitas with onions and cilantro AND a churro! Everything was so flavorful and delicious. This place is the real deal great authentic Mexican food. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Folks you can't get better tacos then this joint. Everything is perfect about this place. Only six months old so come and support them & give it a try for yourself. Everything is so fresh and you have to try the dark smoky salsa... so good!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  Super flavorful.   Staff is great. We've been 3 times since opening in night.  It's a Chipotle on flavor steroids with a full bar!"}
{"text":"The simplest things can be the most delicious and there is where Mucha Lucha gets its stellar reputation.  There isn't a lot on the menu but there doesn't need to be.  The fish tacos are crispy and delicious and husband's wet burrito looked fantastic (didn't try because there was flesh inside).  Pair your meal with a Mexican Coke and you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Wow.  Really, really great street tacos. Friendly service good food. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food. Shrimp tacos are particularly good. Tinga chicken is good on anything. Never had a bad meal here. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"As always, Yelp reviews nailed it. Great tacos! I had 3 flour tacos; Assad's beef, Green Chili beef and Red carnitas pork. All three were terrific. Great hot sauce, too.  Definitely a \"hole-in-the-wall\" but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Love the chicken tinga street tacos. Seriously drool worthy. Spicy and delicious. You have to put all the toppings on - mild salsa with the sauces. So good. My husband has tried the burrito, quesadilla, etc. but the street tacos are my favorite!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing tacos though they are pricey. I haven't tried anything else there so that is what my rating is based on. You have a few different types of meat to choose to fill the tacos with. I usually get the carne asada and beef barbacoa. Then they have different toppings to choose from like guacamole and queso fresco, but those cost extra - wish they didn't. However they do have other salsas and sauces that you can take in little containers. One of them is a guacamole type of sauce.    Place is good but again, wish they didn't charge extra for certain things and they close at 8 which is pretty early so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"This was probably the best taco shop we have ever been to.  We are only in the Phoenix area for one more day, but we will certainly be back.  The food is fantastic and the service is outstanding.  We were super impressed.  If you are looking for great food and stellar service, come here!"}
{"text":"OK so be my wife I have fallen in love with her location in Tempe which was the first one I know this plaza looks a little shady but I am telling you the best Street tacos in the valley the nacho fries are sick their burritos are ridiculous size I highly recommend don't pass this place up we love it here the service is great the food is great"}
{"text":"I have tried the burrito  shrimp  but was not so good .the prices are high compared to the  taco and burrito  shops .."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today.  We shared the five street taco plate with asada beef.  It was delicious!  I will definitely go back.  The food was delicious and the restaurant was clean.  Nice to see a locally owned place.  I hope they are successful."}
{"text":"BEST. STREET. TACOS.  Great little hole in the wall authentic taco shop. The barbacoa beef is so delicious, juice, spicy, and tender. Definitely looking forward to returning and trying more!"}
{"text":"Came in from out of town and stumbled upon a gem. Carne Asada was amazing and staff was very friendly!   If you are in the area craving some genuine Mexican food at a great price, this is your place."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for tacos when I visit Arizona. VERY hot tacos if you like that sort of thing.   Ingredients seem fresh and are delicious. Friendly staff.  Terrible music, but I could care less.   Will always come back to this place because the food is simply delicious."}
{"text":"Nice little Mexican restaurant.  I like Mexican food a lot.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great little spot, but nothing to particularly write home about, in my book.  I got a taco salad, which was a lot bigger than I was expecting.  However, the shell was fried and very greasy and not the baked tortilla shell that it seemed in the menu's picture.  Other than that, it was all around a great little joint.  Felicidades a los dueños por este restaurante!  Que Dios los bendiga!"}
{"text":"Awesome street taco style Mexican.  I highly recommend the bandera burrito.   The prices are very good and it is nice to have an authentic taqueria in Fountain Hills"}
{"text":"The best quick Mexican food I have found in the valley. Full stop.  Street tacos? Superb. Burritos? Huge, not greasy, filling. Enchilada sauce? Spicy with just the right amount of bitter. Their selection of meats is more varied than most, and every one I have tried has knocked it out of the park. Their Carne asada is cooked fresh on their full view cast iron grill. Hands down the best green Chile beef I have ever had. Red Chile carnitas. Barbacoa. Tinga chicken. White breast chicken. The hardest part is choosing which one.  Their fillings and toppings, while not great in number makes up in quality. Fresh sour cream, pickled and raw onions, cilatro, corn, amazing guacamole (some of the best non-homemade I've had), along with the requisite beans and rice make a great compliment to the protein offerings.  Last but not least is the salsa bar with 5-6 fresh salsas depending on the day. Hot, medium, mild, Pico, jalapenos, fresh peppers, and what I like to call 'the green stuff'. Very, very hot but don't be afraid of it! Has a creamy hummus-like consistency that adds a potent jalapeño punch. Tasty. Best of all? I don't feel like I need a shower after scarfing down a burrito here (I'm looking at you Filibertos).  So, yeah, overall I like it a little."}
{"text":"Small location -- and off the main street of FHB -- Behind the FH bike shop.  Really, really, really good casual Mexican food -- best Mexican in FH by far!!!"}
{"text":"First off, walked in and this place was already busy so I was very happy to see them busy cause it must good here! My thoughts were not wrong at all. I got their 5 street tacos deal and super nachos.   Their tacos was very delicious. I got their asada beef and the meat was very soft and savory. I like how they have so much toppings compare to other places. The nachos was nothing special. Service was great and they seem to make your order very fast.   I would definitely come back whenever i'm in town again."}
{"text":"We ordered 5 street tacos and nachos. Food was tasty, salsas were spicy but good. Price was reasonable for the portion of food. The restaurant decor is nice and overall the place is clean. We will definitely return. Please add horchata and jamaica to the drink menu."}
{"text":"Wow, was this place amazing. This taco shop was right down the street from ASU Tempe campus. They have an easy to understand menu that doesn't overwhelm you with options. It may be a small place but they have about seven tables inside that you can sit at. The food tasted fresh and had lots of flavor compared to other taco shops I have been to. I like that you get to choose what you want on your food. You choose your base and then add on what you want.  The prices are a little on the high side but that's because you are getting better quality food and it's totally worth it!  Service was great. No long lines and didn't have to wait to long for the food. They thanked us for coming as we left.  It's in a outside strip mall area that has a good amount of parking.  You guys have to try this place out! I highly recommend it! I'm definitely coming here again soon!"}
{"text":"Been wanting fish tacos for weeks now. I was in town this past weekend and was looking for a good spot to eat. Checked on yelp and decided on mexican. Checked out reviews and decided on this place. Got there right after it closed...oh well. Had my heart set on some fish tacos. Ended up going to Rosarita's...bad move. Their review is coming...no bueno. Next day we came back and those fish tacos were da bomb. It came with black beans, rice, and tomatos. Add that jalapeño cream to em' and it took the taco to another level...delish. The only downfall is the fish strips were thin. Not enough meat on the strips. Can you thicken the strips please? I will surely keep yall in mind if I ever come to Tempe again."}
{"text":"great street tacos and tostadsas! I haven't tried the burritos but they look delicious, the beans are fresh and the workers give you just what you want and the prices are not too bad.. my staple for mexican when I'm in Tempe..   5 STARS"}
{"text":"So nice to be able to totally trust Yelp reviews!! This little gem of a cafe was above expectations! We enjoyed a pleasant and spirited conversation with the owners. I felt we not only found a wonderful cafe, but some friends......        Please treat yourself to this experience in life."}
{"text":"Just found this place! It is phenomenal. I ordered the Bandera Wet Burrito (excellent!) and also sampled my daughters burrito and my sons quesadilla and pinto beans. Everything was great! We will be back often."}
{"text":"The service is amazing! Caleb is very very nice. They have a wide selection lunch and dinner items as well as an amazing breakfast selection that  includes a breakfast burrito and a yummy breakfast bowl.  Churros are da bomb!! Lucha theme is the best!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of choices at Mucha Lucha, you order your food a lot like at chipotle by going down the line and communicating with a cook. If you don't speak Spanish there may be a language barrier. I asked the cook for some suggestions, and not only could she not answer me, neither could the woman next to her. She started slinging meat onto the tortilla, making my decision for me, I asked that they do the burrito enchilada style. Nope. Didn't happen. I have no idea what my burrito is, and it's definitely not done enchilada style. The cashier offered to make it again, but I didn't want to hold up the very long line, I should have brushed up on my Espanol before coming in."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Love their burrito bowls! Flavor is amazing, gives chipotle a run for their money! Carne asada is bomb!"}
{"text":"Had the 5 street tacos. 2 green chili beef and 3 red chicken. Excellent flavor and very spicy. 5 tacos and a drink runs you $10 so good value! Definitely will make you sweat!"}
{"text":"Super duper good taco shop. Awesome staff. I had the 5 street taco deal. Carne asada is the best I've ever had. Barbacoa is the bomb. Loved the green chile beef!!  Chicken is good, heck they're all great!  Can't wait to come back, will definitely be a weekly visit for me."}
{"text":"We had lunch here, after consulting Yelp and looking for tacos.  My favorite is tacos Al Pastor. After i ordered it, they told me they had just added it to the menu and I was the first person to order it.  Well....it was delicious!  Little bits of pineapple were awesome with the marinated pork and a great assortment of toppings.  Lobed the cabbage and pickeled onions.  Highly recommend!  People were super nice too:)"}
{"text":"From out of town, went based off Yelp reviews and we weren't disappointed...we had their street tacos, flour tacos, rolled tacos and macho fries-all were very flavorful! Will be back when we're back in town"}
{"text":"Love this local place! I go at least once a week. Made to order fresh food. Very nice owners!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great energy! Fresh  delicious food! Be back for sure . Don't know why we didn't come here sooner"}
{"text":"My go to taco shop. Fountain Hills is full of Mexican food places but this is the best. Maria and her family always make the best.  My favorite is two tostadas. We go twice a week and never have been disappointed.  Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! Highly recommend!!! Tiny hole in the wall. Super friendly and helpful staff.  Had 5 street tacos fried fish tacos yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"Want amazing tacos? Brilliant burritos? This is the place! The meats are the stars and they can put them together in taco, chimis, rolled, burritos, and street style form. The guacamole is spot on and the variety of sauces range from mild to volcanic.   I'm nuts for their green chili but it is definitely at my heat tolerance level. My wife thinks mild is too spicy but they have one chicken style that even she can eat and enjoy.  But be warned, they can pack a spicy heat wallop in some of their meats. It is sooooo good!   And I love the ambiance. If I had a man cave, I would deck it out in the same awesome Mexican wrestler images. Think cool taco factory in Puerto Vallarta."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall kinda place! They always greet us and whenever we leave they always wish us a good day. Workers their are all super friendly and it makes you feel at home. The food there is also awesome! Never left there hungry or unhappy. Definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"This place was off the chain. Seriously the best Mexican food I've ever eaten. It was pricey but completely worth it. I had the 4 meat tacos and my friend had the fish tacos. Absolutely delectable."}
{"text":"I'm giving these girls a big thumbs up! Great burrito bowls & tacos. Beef was soooo tasty."}
{"text":"I may actually be addicted to this place. Maskadores is a pretty basic set up--one chooses a protein, picks a dish, then adds extras at the counter. I usually get the vegetarian \"wet\" burrito--two full meals. Both the red and the green sauce are excellent. I prefer the red, but it's a close call. The beans and rice are perfectly seasoned.  FYI for those who don't like cilantro (and I feel bad for you), it's a separate topping from the pico. The pickled onions and corn are extra touches not found everywhere. The fried fish is great too if one wants something a bit healthier like a burrito bowl. Just a warning, \"hot\" on the salsa bar means the back of your throat will be on fire for five minutes. The mild salsas are tasty and still plenty spicy. Maskadores is all female staffed and for counter service everyone is really nice. I find a way to come here once, sometimes twice a week. This is my new favorite and much better than the other taco/burrito shops in the area."}
{"text":"Only the best Mexican food in Arizona. Don't forget to add jalapeño cream cheese on everything."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!!! So I just tried this place tonight, and the food is so good. There were so many choices and variations that I just got several things for my family and I to share. We got the bandera wet burrito, the street tacos, the regular tacos, and a cheese crisp for my picky son.  To start out I decided I would just have one of each type of taco, and one bite from each end of the burrito. My final decision is that this food is FANTASTIC!!! Biting into these items was like a flavor explosion in my mouth. Since there were so many toppings to choose from, I told them to out everything except for guacamole on my food. Recommendation, when going to someplace new let the workers guide you. The toppings that they put on were a perfect blend and complimented each other well.  I can honestly say that I am satisfied with my good purchase tonight. I will definitely be back in the near future, although probably just for one entree as the portions are petty big."}
{"text":"Found this place online and decided to check it out.  The place is on the smaller size but the food was very fresh. I ordered the burrito and they have have many different choices for protein. The salsa was on the spicy side which I like but if you don't like spicy be careful."}
{"text":"This will be my new go to for tacos, 100% amazing. I had the 3 tacos today (carne asada, barbacoa, and vinagretta) and they all exceeded expectations by a lot."}
{"text":"This little taco/ burrito shop has been good for a few years! It went by a different name previously and now they new Mucha Lucha concept, more people are coming in! The food is good and the atmosphere is very quaint! I highly recommend the 5 tacos or the Quesadilla!"}
{"text":"When I walked in I was greeted promply and asked how I heard about the restaurant. I told her my car was a few doors down getting some maintenance done and I just happened to walk by. The owner told me this place just opened a week ago (04/08/11) The place is well decorated and has a huge TV hanging on one wall, the music is traditional mexican which complements the bright colors and Mexican decor. This is a great place for lunch, late breakfast or dinner, reasonably priced, good food and service with a smile.  The hours:  Open Monday through Saturday 9am to 9pm  Location:  North East corner of Hardy and Broadway  Menu:  Burritos $5.49  with choice of tortillas: flour, wheat, tomato basil and choice of Carne Asada (Grilled Steak), Pollo Asado (Grilled Chicken), Barbacoa (Shredded Beef), Adobada (Pulled Pork) and Carnitas (Pork)  They have rice, black or brown beans, jack cheese, sour cream, roasted chile corn salsa, romain lettuce and different salsas from mild to spicy.  They also offer Tacos with the same meat options for $1.25 each, Taco Salad for $5.99, Quesadillas (open face) for $4.49 with meat for $1 more and Nachos for $5.99"}
{"text":"Very good carne asada.  The nachos aren't nachos.  They're chips with whatever meat you want and shredded cheese added as a topping.  I was expecting cheese sauce :("}
{"text":"New place. It is ok. I've had better. I have had worse. The burritos are huge. The salsa is spicy.  If you like Chipotle you will like this place."}
{"text":"The place is nice and clean.  Staff was friendly.  Ordered a chimmi and my mouth is slightly on fire.  In a good way.  I liked how you can custimize what you want easily.  I realize that concept is not new or exclusive, just comparing it to a traditional sit down resturant where you don't see the food being prepared in front of you.   If given the option of going here or another place that is a corporate chain that serves similar food I would much rather come here.  The quality of the food surpasses them. I was trying to think of something funny and creative to add but the food coma is about to hit.  So i will end this buy saying come try it, the food is good, fun concept (decoration theme).  If you like to get your drink on they have that also.  You really can't go wrong with quality food."}
{"text":"I want to give my very first Yelp review to the amazing people who make the best tacos at Mucha Lucha, Im new to Mexican food but thanks to Mucha Lucas I've fallen in love. I'll be a regular for life, best Mexican I've had since moving from the Midwest last year. Street Tacos are my favorite Mexican food and I've been going all throughout Phoenix looking for anyone with the best carne Asada tacos, but so far Mucha Lucha wins in every category. I could eat here everyday and be happy, great staff and amazing food. So good that I had to get on yelp and write my first review."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place!  The ingredients are fresh, the place is clean and the owner and staff are awesome!  Even though they're most known for their meat options, the vegetarian burrito is hands down the best I've ever had!  Try the jalepeno cream cheese too....it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in the are! The tacos were BOMB!  The service was awesome and the food was tremendous!"}
{"text":"It's a day later and my mouth is still on fire from the roja hot sauce.  Holy cow.  Gulf shrimp wet burrito was delicious!"}
{"text":"Friendly faces, great food, unique decor!  Hubby had wet chimichanga with beef, I had meat burrito with beef.  Both were delicious and huge!  The prices were also good."}
{"text":"I loved this place! From the art that COVERS the walls, the tables, the food to the service at the counter. The food was amazing and line almost out the door! Can't think of a better place to get anything Taco related!"}
{"text":"Great flavor and salsa.  Where's the meat ? Felt like there's hardly anything in my 5 street tacos.  Really hard to find location."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here and it has solidified itself as my favorite taco joint. Legit delicious food: the ladies are so friendly and make me smile. This is a local treasure and a must stop for taco fans."}
{"text":"Great food!  Rolled tacos with potato inside are amazing!  Interesting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early lunch.   Nice clean restaurant,  friendly staff, alternative music playing overhead and a cool gimmick for the theme.  Ordered the street tacos my way and they were excellent!  Food all tasted clean and fresh and the red salsa was SPICY!  Will definitely be back to try some more of the menu."}
{"text":"Flavorful inexpensive real Mexican food! Super Nachos are awesome and so are the 4 street tacos. The type of place you want to tip, great hardworking friendly service. Also loved the art on the wall, created a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"5 stars for a taco shop???  Hell yes.  This is my favorite food in Fountain Hills by far.  Everyone I bring here agrees with me that these are some of the best tacos they've ever had.  My fave is the barbacoa beef."}
{"text":"The tacos are off the hook.   The burritos look like they feed a small army.   I wish I had time to go a second time.  You go for the food not the atmosphere.    It is a hole in the wall.  But worth the caloric intake!"}
{"text":"Absolutelty amazing.  Great quality food and the portions are pretty damn big.  Will go back soon."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in fountain Hills best Mexican food wonderful staff love Maria"}
{"text":"The green chili sauce for the wet burrito has a nice kick to it. Barbados meat is flavorful."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely AMAZING.  The area looks a little sketchy, tucked in a little plaza that you could drive right past and not even know it was there. My office happens to be just a few blocks away from this place, one day I was craving some mexican food for lunch but I was looking for something a little more authentic than Filibertos(blehhh). Being hispanic, Im pretty critical and picky when it comes to eating at a hispanic establishment, this place was spot on with the flavors. I walked in right way and was greeted by 2 latin women at the counter, the set up was kind of like a burrito bar, like chipotle in way(only way better) you start by choosing your burrito, then your veggies and other toppings, the burrito was as big as a baby! amazing burrito... and that jalapeno cream cheese!!! heaven."}
{"text":"I walked into Maskadores and immediately liked the space and the vibe.  We celebrated my daughter in laws birthday here on a Monday night and they took care of us like family.   Great music (both DJ and Live Bands).  But the greatest thing about Maskadores is the food.  Amazing street tacos!  Get the carnitas with pickled onions and pico.  Wow!  Green chili chicken and carne asada was also delicious.  Wether you live around the corner or across town, make this your next stop!"}
{"text":"I had the 5-taco meal and got one of the chicken, pork, and beef types (sorry, I forget which ones).  They were all super tasty.  This place is very affordable and I really found the Mexican wrestling motif to be super entertaining.  I was smiling while I ate!  The workers were friendly and asked me if I had been here before, where I was from, etc.  I can't wait to go back as there are a number of things I'd like to try with a large assortment of different meats for whatever you order.  This compares well with the great taco places I've experienced in southern California.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is honestly my favorite place for Mexican food. Prices are very reasonable and the food is life changing. Everything I've tried here is delicious - street tacos, wet burritos, tostadas, and my favorite, nachos! No one should ever have to settle for microwaved American cheese over tortilla chips (or worse, Taco Bell) when there's such an amazing, authentic place right here in Tempe! And they have cool wall art! In all seriousness, definitely give Mucha Lucha a try if you haven't before. Fantastic food, and a great price!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. I quality of their ingredients are phenomenal! A lot of Mexican restaurants have a grease, no grease here. Everything is super fresh and pretty much everything seems as if they are made here. I've been here twice now and both experiences have been amazing. I've brought, my boss, friends, and parents here. Also, GET THE CHURROS. They arnt on the menu but sooooo delectable. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"this place is near my office , and when im craving good Mexican food  this where i go !!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and there was plenty of it!  We were in Tempe to visit our son at ASU and my husband picked the spot because of great Yelp reviews.  We weren't disappointed.    I think I left my cardigan sweater there, thus my only complaint is that I can't get through via the phone or email to ask someone if it was indeed found.  It does not take away from the great food!"}
{"text":"Move over Chipotle! I read good things here about Sombrero's and I happened to be in the area today so I stopped. This is the best hole-in-the-wall Mexican in Phoenix. The food is seriously great. Fresh, home-cooked, and high quality. I only tried the nachos. The chips are thin and crispy and the carne asada is some of the best I have ever had. They make it any way you want it and they have a ton of protein options. The ladies that run this place are the best; fast, friendly and great cooks. Try it."}
{"text":"Love this place. They cook things fresh when you order, and if you like it spicy- you've come to he right place. The    Gals are always friendly and the atmosphere is very clean. My favorite is the bandera  wet burrito- yum!"}
{"text":"I wasn't born Mexican, but dinner at Mucha Lucha makes me wish I was. I went with my husband, and we both had burrito bowls. I know that people aren't eating burrito bowls in Guadalajara, but maybe they should. I got the chicken tinga and had the very kind, helpful attentive people behind the counter pile on all the hot s@#t they had. My husband got the green beef and did likewise. We sat there sweating, our lips burning, in an act similar to self-mutilation because it was just that good. If I had any complaints at all it was that the water cups were pitifully small, and I ended up taking two back to the table at one point so I wasn't refilling it every second; beer would have been a nice way to cut some of the heat. I am willing to overlook this and submit 5 stars, however, because we had a damn fine meal for 15 bucks while enjoying the murals of Mexican wrestlers and service from some nice people. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Good intentions. So close, but alas not quite good enough. The beef and pork are extremely salty, we couldn't eat it. Everything else is mostly premade and nothing special. Edible."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Came up to Bookman's on 19thave found this place tucked away across the street by Boston Market. Tacos were awesome had the Asada Ranchera and wife had Green Chile street tacos, I wish I was closer would totally be a regular. 10 different meats to choose from even Tinga. drop in check it out you wont be disapointed...P.S. aguas con el guacamole por que muerde un poco si no estas listo"}
{"text":"Yummy custom made Tacos with fresh ingredients...like a home made version of chipotle...I'm vegetarian so I was able to go meat free and still have a lot of choices. this is my new favorite taco shop!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the staff friendly, but the ordering process is tedious and confusing!"}
{"text":"Great burritos, fresh local mom & pap place. Prices are same as chipotle but 100 times better"}
{"text":"I work nearby so it is a convenient place for lunch. I have noticed their drinks and always wanted to come on a weekend. I did and was surprised when I got a huge beer. Now, I will come more often...:) Staff if always pleasant and food is so amazing. Really fresh, uniquely spicy, delectful to those seeking that authentic taste. it would please anyone, including vegans."}
{"text":"Love this place...meat selections abound and all are excellent and fairly spicy. Five stars for sure"}
{"text":"Great fish and shrimp tacos as well as burritos!! Staff is very friendly.. Friday's they have el pastor which is to die for.!"}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos are amazing. Very clean and well operated. Definitely gonna come here again"}
{"text":"So delicious and authentic!  Tacos are made right then so super fresh!  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"This place was really busy at lunch time during the week.  All tables are taken and you walk through the tables while waiting in line. Menu is on the wall.  I think the prices are a bit high.  You order when you get to the front and your food is put together while you wait and then pay at the register.  My kid loved the tacos but liked one of the chicken ones best.  The beans are whole bean and not refried.  I tried the steak quesadilla and it was quite plain.  Paid extra for the jalapeno cream cheese on the side and that was my favorite part of the meal.  The soda machine was flat the day we ate here."}
{"text":"We go here for lunch about once a month. Portions are huge, their salsa is so good. Love their food."}
{"text":"Best Tacos I've had in the Valley so far. Incredible selection of meat and the chipotle sauce is a must. They also have a plethora of options - nachos, quesadilla, chimichangas, burritos, wet burritos, street tacos, sopes, roll tacos, it goes on and on."}
{"text":"Update: I went back here a few days later because I love fish tacos. I can confidently conclude,  after two visits, this place is great for more than just the tacos. The employees are so personable.  I got this vibe the first time I went as the customers and staff exchanged friendly banter while the staff diligently executed their taco making duties. But it wasn't just a fluke; the people that work here are awesome. It is definitely a business I want to support. They in exchange can support my frequent appetite for fish tacos. I may even go so far as to explore other menu options and diverse my taco experience."}
{"text":"Great Burrito. Got the wet burrito with red chicken and green sauce. Was great tasting but a little on the hot side. If im ever in az again i will go back but will remember to get the red sauce."}
{"text":"....AMAZING!!!   I am writing this review for 2 reasons...  1. This was the best burrito I've had. Period. I had an asada wet burrito. It's got a chipotle style order process. The gal served up a beautiful tortilla with beans, rice and asada and then asked what else I wanted. Cilantro, lettuce, onion, salsa...what came out was a work of art that barely fit on a 12\" plate. It was perfect in every way.  Tortilla was delicious, asada was flavorful and done perfect. The enchilada sauce was more spicy than expected, but so flavorful that it works perfect, I was scraping it up with a tortilla chip. The cilantro and flavor of the rice really brought it all together.   2. This location is just horrible, I pray they can get the word out fast enough to overcome the lack of accidental traffic...nobody will accidentally find this place.   Go there...spread the word!! This enchilada sauce must be alive here in Mesa!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome! Fresh food with delicious homemade salsa and horchata! Their servings are ginormous! I would go back if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"The tacos are filled with great flavor!! Street tacos, so they are kinda small but not that pricey.:) The fish and shrimp tacos are great! And make sure you get the spicy salsa from behind the counter! Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Fountain Hills that's a little off the beaten path.  (They changed their name from Mucha Lucha to Maskadores which threw me off when I couldn't find the restaurant again on google maps.)  I live 30 miles away but every time I find myself in Fountain Hills I make a point of going here.  When I've brought others here they all agree they serve fantastic food made to your liking.  This has to be one of the cleanest restaurants I've been to.   I recently had three soft shell tacos each made with a different type of meat (chicken, beef(spicy) & pork) hoping to find a favorite but they were all very good.  They offer a large selection different toppings"}
{"text":"The best I've ever had!  New favorite place.  The jalapeno cream cheese is delicious.  Customer service was good.  Friendly.  I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and loved it every time. The jalapeño cream cheese is so good. One of my all time favorite taco shops."}
{"text":"Great food and extremely friendly staff. Very clean place. The food tasted quite authentic... Although I am not Mexican. Had a lot of vegetarian choices for me."}
{"text":"I recently moved, and I now live very close to the strip mall where this place is located. I was thinking about going to the Subway...I'm glad I didn't. The food is prepared fast, the ingredients taste fresh, and the staff is very friendly. I had a carne asasa burrito and it was very good. I will return!"}
{"text":"The ladies at the counter were super friendly and got our order out quick. Not the best location, but the restaurant itself is very clean. Be careful though if you can't do spicy food! My friend was almost crying from how spicy the salsa verde was (but it was still fresh and tasty)! Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Food is fantastic. Salsas are all homemade fresh everyday. The need a better way to order though. Their system is really confusing and people get mad because of the confusion. They still get 5 stars because its super good food. The pricing is a little high too, but the food is worth it! They should drop the prices by 1 dollar per item and it would be in the right spot. All around a really great place. Cute girls work here too."}
{"text":"So far I've been here 3 times already, really digging the food and the customer service, not to long of a wait time. Staff is very friendly and always smiling for a staff of 2 people. Salsas are a bit on the spicy side but still good"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Authentic, fresh, clean, friendly. I love it!!! I can't wait to come back. Tempe needed this place."}
{"text":"The service was good.  Tinga Quesadilla was excellent.  I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Fountain Hills. Friendly staff.  We sampled the green chile beef,  the red carnitas and the carne asada .  All were excellent The green beef was very spicy but had excellent flavor.  The red carnitas was the standout.  Super Yum! We will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome burrito, tacos were good but dry, maybe old tortillas with too much air time? The foods that you would expect to be spicy are. Primarily tacos and burritos served here and the wait wasn't bad."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews, we decided to go and give it a try. The place looks really nice but would be nicer if the trash cans weren't overflowing and the tables cleaned. We went Wednesday evening, it wasn't too busy, probably 3 people in front on us waiting in line and it took a good 15 mins to take our order. The food was good but cold. They seem to need help to keep up. We will give a couple of months before returning to see if there is improvement. Not really impressed with the experience."}
{"text":"Hands down the best taco shop I've encountered here in the Phoenix area.  Fast & friendly service, reasonably priced, good-size portions, and food was extremely fresh and seasoned  well!   The chipotle chicken was my favorite since I like a lot of spice.  Excellent!!"}
{"text":"Food very good.  Had carne Asado nachos with jalepeno cream cheese.  Flour tacos were great.  Enjoyed, if I had to say anything would be dining area cleanliness.  Had to wipe tables and floors need to be cleaned and mopped.  Overall good experience- kept a company constant flow of traffic - very enthusiastic behind counter"}
{"text":"Way to go Mucha Lucha. Got the 5 taco plate. Wow the meat and toppings were very flavorful cuz they are cooked with the proper spices. The spicy pork was truly spicy. The carne asada was my favorite. The hot sauces were a great complement to the fresh toppings. Next time I'm in Tempe, I'm going back to Mucha Lucha."}
{"text":"Years of hitting forgettable taquerias lead us here... what an excellent change of pace.   The carne asada is unassuming... until you eat it. So much flavor. So much love put into the food prep. The enchilida sauce has a good spice to it.  Hats off the chef and staff, great food!  Bring your own metal silverware if you get a wet burrito, the plastic utensils are worthless.   And the bathroom is a sauna."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, but I'm not sure how you'd find it otherwise.  It is in a small strip mall with a nondescript sign.  Other reviewers have accurately described this place as a hidden gem.  The food here is absolutely legit.  The carne asada done ranchero style (with peppers and onions) is amazing.  I work in Tempe town lake and try to make it here twice a week for lunch.  Try the green dip on the sauce bar.  It is made with pablano peppers and has addictive properties that must mirror those of crack cocaine.  These people genuinely appreciate your business.  They greet you with a friendly smile and are glad to help explain the menu options."}
{"text":"Here in Tempe for some business...must say this place was a great find..street tacos are amazing. .must try the wet burritos they are huge filled with meat and the customer service is outstanding. .. keep up the good food sombreros"}
{"text":"It is a mighty burrito and for me it is the best. The spicy is really spicy and they tell you that as the environment is really friendly and everyone loves them. Really good place for Mexican food specially the burritos"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.... $3.50 cents for a glass bottle coke after tax? Seriously a 250% profit and a burrito paid $16...this is highway robbery at it's best."}
{"text":"We visited this shop based on some Yelp reviews and a hankering for street tacos.  If you haven't been before, your first impression will almost certainly be \"hot poops, coming up.\"    You wouldn't be further from the truth.  The meats here are incredibly good, you really can't go wrong no matter what you pick. All the toppings are fresh or cooked fresh, just mouth watering.   Service is great, and atmosphere is cozy. We've been back twice since, and are never disappointed! And no hot poops!"}
{"text":"I've gone to mucha lucha in Tempe all the time and these are the same owners. The mucha lucha in Tempe is way better with bigger portions. I literally got a spoonful of meat and was told if I want more I need to pay more. If you guys look at my reviews I hardly ever leave a bad review. The customer service here is horrible. I was told I can only have one napkin. And the cashier was mad when I grabbed two. I won't be back to this location"}
{"text":"I was blown away, absolutely blown away, by this place. I've driven by this shop probably a thousand times, never even knew it was there. I did a Yelp search for a lunch in Tempe since I work on the Phoenix border and decided on coming here based on the great Yelp reviews.  I walk in and there's a line of ten, part of me is like \"go to the kabob place next door\" and the other part of me is like \"if there's a line it's worth it\". It took me about 10 minutes to get to the front to order.  I opted for a wet chimichanga with red sauce and sour cream, filled with carne asada, rice, black beans, veggies and cheese. It took them about five minutes to get everything completed, imagine chipotle if the ingredients were more authentic and more fresh.  Finding a seat wasn't too difficult because most people seem to opt to take out, which I might do in the future as well.   The first bite was amazing and it only got better. That red sauce had a kick, which I don't usually like but my god the flavors were there. I cannot believe this is a little hole in the wall taco shop. The food justifies the price, I was really impressed.   P.S. The murals on the wall are super dope, this may be the cleanest taco  shop I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Best little taco shop in town. Authentic street tacos! Fish tacos excellent!! It's a must visit!! Lunch time you Kay have a line! Worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Great fast tacos in Tempe! We tried all types! Staff is friendly & fast! Tacos are the real deal-  yum!"}
{"text":"This place is trash... Horrible service the older lady was very rude and her attitude showed the second we walked into the door rolled her eyes and proceeded to keep rolling them for EVERY person who walked in after us. Completely ignored my wife and only addressed me to order there soda machine wasn't working and when asked for a bottle they said they would fix it and never did! Don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Wow. I had just moved here from LA, and socal is know for some of the best Mexican you can get in the states. A couple weeks of being here, I see a coupon from Mucha Lucha Taco, for two FREE tacos at my door, as they are a 2 min walk from my apartment complex. My roommate brought me a taco after work one day from the coupon, and I immediately knew we had a local gem. I went back today to try a burrito, and the process is very similiar to that of a Chipotle, but WAY better(And SOO much fresher) One of the best burritos I've ever had hands down. Support this small business as I do not want them to move away.. ever. Give up Chipotle and Go Mucha Lucha!"}
{"text":"People are very nice, but sadly the food isn't as top-notch as I expected based on all the rave reviews.  Interesting menu, though.  I do agree with the other reviewer about the dubious food handling.  I didn't like the way the prep station is kept."}
{"text":"Fire. Absolutely delicious. I had the macho fries with carne asada. My sis ordered chicken tinga, barbacoa, and carnitas tacos. All the meat and other ingredients were fabulous and fresh!"}
{"text":"Very good, close to home I didn't get the gentleman   Name behind the counter but awesome customer service"}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place but everything is delicious and well prepared. Very friendly welcome. Offered tastes to decide what to order. The red chicken chili burrito was the best I have ever had - seriously good! Horchata and street tacos were also fantastic. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The decor at Mucha Lucha helps to set the tone and let you know that you're about to get some serious mexican food. Every mexican restaurant needs luchadores and Chapulin Colorado on the walls. I ordered the red chili carnitas burrito. The red chili is no joke! My eyes were watering and I must have downed five Jarritos with my burrito. Despite the pain, I was enjoying one of the best burritos I've ever had. Maybe next time I'll get the regular carnitas so that I can actually enjoy the deliciousness that is Mucha Lucha. The ladies behind the counter were so nice and accommodating like an old school abuelita. They definitely help the ambience. If I'm in Tempe again, I'm hitting up mucha lucha."}
{"text":"Definitely a good choice.. They were friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"We wanted to take our daughter out for dinner to celebrate. She had recently been to a newer restaurant in Fountain Hills called the \"Maskadores Taco Shop\" and wanted to share it with me and my wife. I am generally pretty positive in my reviews and base them on a combination of food quality, ambiance and cost. This place was awesome! Great food, which was very fresh, friendly staff and very reasonably priced. This may be our new \"go to\" place in town. Oh, and make sure you have the churros! They were not on the menu, but were the best."}
{"text":"Went to eat last night at 7pm and it was closed. Suppose to be open to 9 according to yelp."}
{"text":"I was visiting for a work trip and looked a few restaurants up to try while in Arizona... This Florida boy was very impressed!!! I got the floor tacos and those tortillas alone were amazing. I know Jane aragon to come back to Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! So glad to have this right in our neighborhood. The proprietors and employees are probably some of the most helpful and friendly people I've met here. If you haven't tried this place you're doing yourself a disservice. The smothered burritos and burrito bowls are my favorite but I don't think you can find anything bad on the menu. Go there now!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a good price. Went and picked up breakfast burritos for my family a few days back, and the food was excellent! Glad they're literally right across the street, I'll def be back for more."}
{"text":"Super legit tacos, and burritos. Tacos are straight street taco style = they are small.  I originally came in to grab some tacos, you can order a 5 pack and don't have to stick to one or two meats.  The tacos were on point, meat had plenty of flavor to them, the salsa bar was solid.  I was so happy with the tacos, I had to take a burrito back to go because they don't sell beer here.  This is what every neighborhood, not just city should have."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Maskadores, I got a Shrimp Burrito delivered and OMG!! So delicious!! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wish this was closer to my house. I'd have dinner here everyday. j/k, but it's seriously good. I had the Carne Asada Fried and they were spot on, juicy carne asada with all the toppings. Will go again, and again ,,,,,,"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! I got the 5 street tacos, and my friends got the 3 flour tacos and the meat burrito....it was all so amazing and their jalapeño cream cheese is awesome too! Definitely would say this place is as good as, if not better then, los taquitos! Definitely will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is amazing the Carne asada open burrito was so great the service was acceptionally great and all together a nice experience. The music was entertaining as well as the paintings on the walls I will recommend this place to everyone I know. thank you Sombrero's"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and perfectly seasoned.  I think I found my favorite place in Fountain Hills.   Definitely recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"Great authentic street tacos. Was super nice that you can add your own toppings. The food was fresh. I do have to say the the hot sauce is hot. The service was fantastic and I will deffentaly be going back."}
{"text":"I must have came on an off day. Cause based on the glowing reviews and what my colleagues were saying, they didnt match up to what I experienced.  I ordered five tacos (barbacoa, green chile beef, chicken adobo, and carne asada). The tortillas tasted like they came from the grocery store. The meats were ALL lukewarm. The servers were in constant turmoil as they took an order from a group of five people. One guy in front of us left because they couldnt finish in order in time and kept messing it up.    Most of the meats were not that great. I imagine they would be great if they were actually hot. The green chile beef was actually hot, although the burn came later (probably due to being lukewarm). I didnt like the fact that the sauces were only behind the counter. Im so use to having sauce available on the table. I was not impressed by what they had to offer. It maybe good have been good, but they need to step their game up."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews for restaurants unless thy are exceptional, which this one most certainly is. Everything about this restaurant is great. GO THERE."}
{"text":"What a gem this place is so glad we found them.  Jennifer, Maria and Monica were very friendly and provided excellent customer service. What can we say, the street tacos were on point. Fresh cooked shrimp to order with all the fixings. Prices are extremely reasonable. I hope to be back before we leave the area. Definitely worth the drive. I wish we had them in our area."}
{"text":"Very happy I stopped and had dinner.  People were very friendly and helpful. They have tasty street tacos and nachos."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food we've had since moving to Arizona. Everything tastes super fresh and delicious. Our kids loved the cheese quesadillas and mini street tacos. The chipotle chicken was awesome. Make sure you get a side of pinto beans and rice."}
{"text":"Awesome taste. The Beans have a toasted taste and cheese is amazing,  with the tortilla it tastes just amazing. Rice was not as good as everything else.  It tasted a bit bland. - Joshua son of Mrs. Picky"}
{"text":"Came to this place as it had great reviews.. not disappointed!  I had the sopas and they were incredible my delicious. The cook/cashier was super friendly and I could not believe the place was not packed.  Would recommend to anyone looking for great Mexican food. The hot sauce was delish!!!"}
{"text":"This place definitely gets 5 stars for keeping the kitchen open past closing time and helping each and every customer standing in line! Mind you after waiting at another place,  we rolled up minutes before closing only to find a line that went to the door.  No worries,  we were set,  the menu was hung high with pictures of everything they served.  They had music and a few chairs inside,  it was definitely a smaller location. I opted for the macho nachos and munchkin ended up with a cheese quesadilla that was huge!   It did have the chipotle style concept BUT taste is anything but chipotle and has them beat by far.  The chipotle sauce was perfect with carnitas rojas which was cooked perfectly.  I wanted to try a few different meats,  but for most meats they cooked to order and I knew they probably wanted to head home.  They also have a jalapeno cream cheese sauce,  which I didn't try this time around.    I will definitely be going back and trying some other meats and tacos.  It seems like every one was ordering their 5 plate tacos!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! It's not just any Berto's chain. I would relate it to a Subway for tacos. First, they have so many different meats that you can choose from. I always get the 3 hard shell tacos with the carne asada, chipotle chicken, and green chili pork. Most of their meats are marinating in a certain sauce, which makes it SO much better. They do have plain options too. They cook the food in front of you, put it in whatever kind of taco item you choose, and then they go through all the toppings and sauces with you and you choose what you want on it. I don't know why, but I always feel like a burden when I ask for something without onions. Then, there's always a 50/50 chance that there I'll be onions on it anyway. This alleviates that whole step. You just say \"Can I get lettuce, tomatoes, etc...\" (Just like Subway!) You can also choose whether or not you want rice and beans, which is always nice so that those of you who don't want it don't waste food when the meal comes with it automatically. They also have several different salsas in the dining area for an extra little kick, that are all delicious. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Eat here. Great food, great atmosphere, and a great price! You get legit Mexican tacos full of flavor when you come here.  I had the three floor tacos (full sized, not street taco sized) and a drink for just over $10! That's better than what you will find at most taco joints near here."}
{"text":"Tacos are supreme!!  You choose which of 18 meat choices you want, and then add any or all of a dozen or more toppings. The same with the taco salad which also includes the choice of rice and/or beans.  Definitely worth a stop by."}
{"text":"Very cool place to eat. Staff is nice and helpful. Restaurant is awsome inside.  Love the paintings. Love the food. Live the service"}
{"text":"We are visiting from Dallas, and this food is amazing! Street tacos were delicious, and the super nachos were heaven."}
{"text":"Wet burrito was so good! The sauces are amazing. Portions were very filling! I tell everyone I know who travels to the Phoenix area that they have to stop here!"}
{"text":"This is one of the places which is in the middle of a strip mall, unpretentious and might be even hard to find if you ain't looking properly... but the food is just amazing... order anything and u can't go wrong... my fav is the 5 street tacos and u can mix match the meat.."}
{"text":"It smells like amazing Mexican food. Not very clean though. Food is good. Bathrooms dirty. It is a pretty small shop, so there will be lines during lunch. Prices are very fair. They also make the food right in front of you."}
{"text":"When hunger had me on the ropes, the friendly staff here handed me a burrito that tasted like heaven. Immediately I had new found strength and with my new tag team partner Red Chicken burrito, we close lined my empty stomach.  I love the luchadore vibe. At any minute it feels like a match is about to go down. The Mexican music is awesome and I will be hitting these folks up again. The food is yummy and I'm already wishing this burrito was twice as big."}
{"text":"Still sat here and just had to write this review. Small, friendly, amazing food. Try it.  If you go out to eat for service where you are waited on, try somewhere else, if the reason you go out to eat is to try great food, eat here. Great food. If I lived in the area this would become a regular for me no doubt."}
{"text":"Wow, I am getting ready to move from Arizona and I am so bummed I am just finding this place. My friend Ben and I went together, and oh my! Prepared fresh in front of you, and there wasn't an ingredient that tasted below a 5 star rating. This tortilla was very fresh and the meat was excellent- I ordered a wet burrito with ground beef. I got just about everything you could inside. The red sauce is a little spicy, and of course I added hot sauce inside, so my mouth was on fire, but in the best way possible. Guacamole is extra, but very worth it. I would definitely go back here, almost before any sit-down Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Dope theme, friendly staff, and bomb food, love their carne asada burritos and super nachos ."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST Mexican food in the state!!  I've lived in Arizona for over 43 years so believe me when I say we've tried Every Mexican restaurant here and on the road... this place has the Best tasting, fresh food you will Ever have!!  Their Barbacoa cannot be beat!!  They are opening all over the state so make sure you try this place at any location!!  You Will be back often!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Recently discovered the owner is my neighbor and thought I should check this place out.. so I visited this place during lunch.  Ordered - Five Street tacos (Vegetarian): Though its usual vegetarian tacos, the toppings were kinda mouth watering.  Cost me like $9 for 5 tacos.  Decent ambiance/theme. A tiny place run by women only. Definitely, a must try if you are a meat lover, coz I saw that soul-satisfying faces on those meat lovers sat next to me. Would love to visit this place again for their wet-burritos."}
{"text":"5 stars. Every. Single. Time. It's always amazing. Every time I try something new, I'm so happy with the food! The food is fresh, delicious and so so addicting! Today I finally tried the 5 street tacos and I loved them! I got them with the Tinga Chicken - it's spicy  if you like spicy, I recommend it! My favorite has to be the Bandera Wet Burrito. It's GIANT! Make sure you splurge and pay a but extra to get guacamole and their Jalapeño Cream Cheese ... you can get it with a side of chips, or on top of your food! It's by far the best cream cheese .... ever!!!"}
{"text":"We just moved here from out of state, so now our goal is to find our new favorite restaurants to replace our favs back home.. on the list? Mexican! More specifically? TACOS. Even more specifically? PASTOR!  Yay! Win. We loved the atmosphere inside (though we took it to go!) And service was so friendly (I wish I had gotten names!! We went in Saturday afternoon).  Everything was really delicious and really affordable. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food at this fresh take on custom ordered burritos. Staff is super friendly. It's obvious that a lot of passion has gone into this food. I had the pastor Bandera wet burro. The pork was tender and sweet, and then proceeded to slowly set my mouth afire! The white sauce on the Bandera was some sort of jalapeno cream cheese. Holy cow it's great.  Definitely recommend, will be going back soon to try more options. My buddy says the Barbacoa is amazing."}
{"text":"I cannot say more than what has already been said about this place.  It is wonderful.  I don't mean to demean the other places in FH, but this is the best of all of them."}
{"text":"This place is like chipotle, but authentic Mexican food.   What a great concept!    The people here are great.  The salsas have heat and the carne is amazing!"}
{"text":"Our first visit--enjoyed authentic, custom-made street tacos.  Owner let us try some of the meats to pick for our tacos plates. All yummy and fresh! Will be back on our next trip to Phoenix! Loved the guacamole and carne asada tacos and small corn tortillas. Pinto beans were tasty too."}
{"text":"Thought I would make a quick stop to check out the new taco shop, I am so glad I did! What a treat, there were several people ahead of me and another group milling around in the order area and I couldn't see any rhyme or reason to the line. After watching the crowd I figured out that the group milling around was part of the family of a person in front of me. He stepped up to the left side of the food bar and they all filed around him giving their order to the server. It went very quickly after that as they completed one dish after another.   I had time to look around at the other people in the shop and found what I was sure was the largest burrito in Tempe for $8.00. They use the same shell for the enchiladas so they are just as big. I ordered the Baja Shrimp burrito for $2.00 more and it was excellent, great flavor to the shrimp with their sauces. They cooked it right in front of me and put exactly what toppings I wanted on it.   They have a whole menu from breakfast burrito, to street tacos, to taco salads and chimichanga's. If you are trying to eat healthy, I would suggest the burrito bowl, with of course the super nachos on the side! :-) I am looking forward to going back and trying their Macho Fries. Oh, did I forget to say they have a real live bar????? Not a full bar, but with actual liquor and not just beer and margaritas!!!  Everything was clean, great tasting and everyone in the shop that was eating there had a big smile on their faces. This will be one of my go to places from now on."}
{"text":"This place did not seem clean and smelled like moldy towel. I don't think there is much more to say about that"}
{"text":"Oh MexiCAN Oh MexiCAN!  Another Taco Tuesday success. 5 street tacos cafeteria plate I liked 2, loved 2 and uhh 1 Unique place for sure with culture. Watching the cook prepare his plates shows how much passion he has for the menu. I will be back for those NachoFries! ...to be continued."}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings about lunch today. The red chile is awesome but the options for vegetarians are limited. Their vegetarian option is just beans and rice but it costs as much as all their meat dishes. If they're not going to put vegetables in their dishes, they shouldn't charge the same amount for less. The person in front of me had a much larger burrito."}
{"text":"Cool decor. Great location. Fast service. The inside is pretty small and for a lunch rush it could be hard to find a table to sit. Be prepared to take your food to go. Five star worthy but only three stars because the salsa is almost too spicy to eat. They will ask you if you want salsa in your tacos and in their defense they do call it \"hot\" but this is some next level stuff. Do not order salsa on your tacos or other food unless you are really truly prepared for it. And even if you think you are prepared, maybe still get it on the side. You have been warned. This being said, I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is garbage!  I'm from California and we have superb Mexican food. This place isn't even better than the worst place in cali. The measure the meat, & there not generous with it."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican cuisine in Fountain Hills!  If you like spicy, you will find it here!"}
{"text":"You guys need to try the rolled tacos with asada, they are really good. The only reason I am not giving them five stars is because the seasoning was to salty. Remember, we have salt at home, we can always add some if we need to, but we can't make it less salty."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal - I have been searching for decent Mexican food since I have moved here months ago.You have a choice of several different tasty meats and there is a fresh salsa bar with pickled veg and limes. I ordered the street tacos with no cheese, extra cilantro, pico de gallo and pickled red onions - topped off with a squirt of lime to the last drop. Oh how delicious. The churro also hit the spot. I dont know if there was custard in it or if it was just uncooked dough, but I ate it anyway and it was good  :-)  The staff are fast, efficient and pleasant.  My go-to for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Had 2 tinga chipotle and one vinaigrette tacos with everything on it (just about) and they were hands down some of the best chicken tacos ive ever had and I've eaten all over southern california/phoenix area. Incredible quality and flavor, nothing bad to say! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"I love this taco shop! I would recommend this wonderful place to anyone looking for great authentic food at a great value! I often get the burrito bowl or soft tacos loaded up with tons of fresh yummy ingredients and almost always have some leftovers (which do not last for very long) Also if you love spicy, your gonna love their red hot salsa. Not to mention they have lots of good looking senoritas working here ;)"}
{"text":"Maskadores Taco Shop...Tastiest, Spiciest Street Tacos!  Maskadores serves awesome street tacos.  They serve Burritos and Chimi's as well, but I have only tried the street tacos as that is their self proclaimed specialty.  I have to admit, street tacos are not my personal favorite when it comes to Mexican food, but they are delicious at Maskadores.  The meet is smokey and juicy, cooked to perfection.  I love spicy food and the salsas / hot sauces at Maskadores are SPICY, fyi.  Not to worry, these bad boys don't need salsa, as they are just as good without it.  I highly recommend giving Maskadores a try if you have not already!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients,  friendly people,  good food,  and cheap.  Sounds like 5 stars to me.  The place is small mom pop restaurant.  Come in, order, kinda like Chipotle,  as others have mentioned,  your food is made to order and fresh.  I had the red sauce shredded chicken,  asada and barbacoa tacos.  All good,  but I did like the barbacoa the best.  The only agua fresca is horchata,  I had a Jarritos.  Churros are made fresh as well,  sweet!"}
{"text":"My new fave taco joint in FH. VERY authentic, the owners are happy to explain and let you taste, and the value is awesome!"}
{"text":"Outstanding cafeteria style taco shop, heat of you like it in some of the meats, love the baja shrimp tacos for something more mild, carne asada quesadilla for something more mild, barbacoa has got a medium heat, authentic flavor and great service in clean relaxed atmosphere. Seriously don't pass this place up if in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and love this place! Try the wet burrito, it's amazing. The only bad thing I have to say is that one time I came here and the corn was really hard and kind of ruined the burrito but other than that I've always really loved this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the yummiest tacos in Glibert! Great selection of meats. They have burrito/taco bowls, nachos, you name it! Wish they had some in So Cal"}
{"text":"Sweetest lady preparing the food. Pride of ownership here.  I'm so glad I found this hole-in-the-wall"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place.  Within the category of dives without waiters, this is a 5 star.  The food is so fresh and delicious.  The meat is spicy and of high quality.  The tortillas are homemade and again yummy.  The owning family is sweet, very helpful and really wants their customers to be happy.  My daughter takes golf lessons near here, so we will be regulars--bigtime."}
{"text":"Killer carne asada, good service, salsa bar, what else do you really need? Let's be honest..."}
{"text":"Best Nachos and burrito mojado. They have delicious sauces and fresh ingredients. Small mom and pop and better than Chipotle."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, tasty Mexican food at a reasonable price.....what more can you ask for?  If you are in the Tempe area there is no reason to go to Chipotle or any other chain Mexican spot, this is really the best place in town."}
{"text":"What a FANTASTIC little hole in the wall joint!  I love the food here - VERY authentic and the Luchador paintings ad a touch of whimsy.  You must be serious about eating great Mexican food to eat here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Fresh authentic Mexican food served to order... best Horchata I've had! Prices are reasonable for quality and amount of food. I recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, cool spot! My son also loved the paintings and masks on the wall. The ladies were fast & sweet, they smiled at us multiple times said thank you again as we left. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I stopped by because of all the great reviews but I was underwhelmed. Their biggest flaw is the tortillas: their corn tortillas are like supermarket tortillas.  Their carne asada is not really grilled over charcoal but cooked on a flat griddle and that's just not right. Their chipotle meat is good, as is their pork on red chili, but it's not enough to come back.  Their bathroom is dirty and smells like it's never cleaned properly."}
{"text":"I went in on their second day being open and had a tremendous experience with the staff and the food was outrageously delicious. It's definitely tucked away in a neighborhood location but certainly worth investigating and enjoying. The indoor decorations are very cool and the prices are more than fair."}
{"text":"My favorite taco shop in Tempe! The format is simple, choose the dish (street tacos, tacos, quesadilla, burrito, etc.) and choose your protein (carnitas, pork chili verde, baja shrimp, vegetarian, etc.), they make it in front of you and pile high all the classic toppings you could ever want. If you are craving real Mexican, and you're in the area, be sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp on a business trip. My coworker and I were not disappointed. This place is amazing, the food is prepared fresh, and the Bandera Burrito is as good as advertised. Highly recommend this spot if you have a small group, as the dining area is a bit small."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for this little Gem.  I yelped and found this place close by.   Had the street tacos and they were great.  Very tasty!! Looking forward to return visit because the menu is filled with some more yummy dishes.   If you like Authentic Mexican food.....this is the joint."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I am a vegetarian so the menu was a bit intimidating at first, but once I realized it was almost like a 'chipotle' or 'subway' style of pick what you want I was pleasantly surprised! I got the taco salad and it was amazing and my boyfriend said his chimichanga was awesome! The staff was super helpful and attentive. We will definitely be back next time we're in Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"We got this huge wet burrito and we thought wow. Then we start eating it and her lips were burning her mouth was burning very very spicy hot. Not for us. The meet was good but the rest of it was very very spicy"}
{"text":"Amazing! Finally, some authentic and SPICY Mexican food in Arizona! Order at the counter and watch the staff make your food right in front of you...they grill everything all together on a huge sizzling surface, and then you can add a variety of toppings to your meal (again, they have all the traditional stuff!) sort of Chipotle-style. It was my first time in, but it seems like they get a ton of regulars, and the staff knew their orders by heart. The collection of self-serve salsas are amazing, and are spicy in the way that salsas should be - the spice ADDS to the taste, instead of covering it up. If you're a spicy foods person, you know what I mean. Try this place!"}
{"text":"The neighborhood seemed rough & the store front is questionable. Inside is a few tables (it's quiet & cozy) The food is done Chipotle style.. (You pick & build it) We chose a quesadilla 3.99 Super crane asada  burrito with with all the good stuff.(combo includes drink & chips)  6.99 We got a *free* sample of jalapeño cream cheese which was amazing!  Fresh NONFAKE guac (rare these days!) (1.75)   The *only* questionable part is how much MSg is used! :)    Super Burrito + quesadilla + bean burrito + sangria + medium drink =  $ 19.57  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is unreal good.  My wife & I got married in Cabo, and this is the closest food we can find to the authentic street tacos we had at our reception. Everything is cooked fresh in front of you, which slows down the line, but it is well worth it.  So glad this moved into the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The. Best. Tacos. Hands down. This small hole in the wall taco shop packs a lot of flavor into each dish. I usually get the burrito bowl or tacos, but they have a variety of food including wet burritos and breakfast burritos.   The prices are great and the portions are big! Extra bonus: They have a killer salsa bar with 5-6 salsas, unlimited limes and a couple different pepper mixes. Worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Street tacos and burritos, people!  Keep servin 'em up like this and you'll fill the streets with people shouting at Trump to tear down that wall!  This is the kind of restaurant that makes me grateful for Yelp.  In an otherwise unattractive strip mall hides a perfect little lunch spot.  English is a second language here for the staff and most of the clientele, a good sign for things to come.   Steak burrito with chips and a drink rang up at just over $9 for lunch.  The burrito was sizable, I almost couldn't finish it.  The steak was juicy and tender, the corn salsa sweet and charred, and the sauce a good mix of just enough spice to balance with its creaminess.  This is the lucha we should be fighting, mucho mas Mucha Lucha for me!"}
{"text":"Best street tacos in Tempe, hands down! Try the combo with three different meats or the meat lovers burrito. Take haste with the salsa and keep it on the side. Their salsas are no joke and hot is an understatement, and I love heat!"}
{"text":"After wanting to try this out for years,  I was finally rewarded.  The night before we went to havasupai we wanted something quick and easy; this is what my husband brought home.  He purchased the 4 street taco combo and a chicken burrito as well. This is honestly the best Americanized \"mexican food\" I've had in awhile. The only thing i would change would be to take the sour cream out of the burrito. Otherwise,  Kudos. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"In from out of town and wanted good Mexican food. Maskadores really hit the spot. Got the tacozillas, which were basically tacos with melted cheese and grilled tortillas- awesome!"}
{"text":"Fresh, fast and authentic flavors. Great people. This place is for those who are looking for serious flavor and not what run of the mill Mexican restaurants are offering. We went for our first dinner while visiting family and made sure to go again our last night before heading home to Colorado. Wish we had them where we live! Did I mention they have beer and margs?!"}
{"text":"The staff is extremely friendly, the food is devoid of garbage, and everything tastes great. Do you need any more reasons to check this place out?"}
{"text":"This place is kind of a hole in the wall, but those are usually the best places! This one did not disappoint. We must have looked like we had never been there before because the owner came out and explained the menu to us. She was super friendly. I had the street tacos and my husband had the soft tacos, both were delicious. Very fresh and authentic. They only serve beer and maragaritas so I tried the mango margarita and it was great!"}
{"text":"Was chintzy on the carne asada for the street tacos but otherwise the food was top notch. Homemade ingredients.  FRESH!!! Wish they had descriptions of the meats on their menu. The amazing ladies are soooo busy they have no time to educate you on all the delicious options.  Would take you a year to try all of them.  Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"It was super good!  And it's hard to find veggie/pesca options! The hot sauce is no joke! I had the fried fish nachos and i was happy! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Personalized burro building with exceptionally fresh ingredients, grilled without a trace of grease plus the crispest tortilla chips ever And I wasn't shamed when I did not favor their hot sauces.  Think I'll try their tostadas next time.  PS  Burro is so generous, one lasts for 2 meals or could be shared with a friend."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim and wasn't disappointed! Great servings, delicious, no-frills Mexican food"}
{"text":"Pros: +++Price. 5 traditional tacos for $8 is a good deal no matter how you swing it.  Cons: - Mediocre Tacos - Meat selection is substandard. No Lengua? -- Salsas are highly uninspiring  -------------------------  Overhyped by a mile. A substandard taco shop dressed up to grab a crowd. Any hole in the wall Taco joint is better than this. 2 stars for the food, extra star for price."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and superb quality Mexican food. All of the ingredients were delicious! First visit I ordered a open burrito with carne asada, spicy shredded beef, pinto beans, lettuce, roasted corn, guacamole, mild salsa, and the flavor was so robust! Their salsas are spicy indeed!  I was blown away by the flavor and the friendliness of the ladies working I had to come back the next day!  I ordered 6 corn tacos trying each meat and also a carne asada quesadilla on a chipotle tortilla.  Each meat was so tender and delicious!  Their jalapeño cream cheese was a magnificent addition to the tacos.  The best part? It's very affordable!   Bean and cheese burrito + chips & guacamole + 6 corn tacos + carne asada quesadilla + 2 Mexican Coca-Colas + friendly workers = $25.  Believe all the great reviews!  This is a nice find here in the Valley. Sorry Chipotle, I will come here from now on!!  Please just take my money!"}
{"text":"So excited that Maskadores Taco Shop opened up near work now to add to the lunch time eats!  Maskadores Tacos are delish!!! And some are on spicy side of life, and oh do I love that!  Today I ordered 5 street tacos (under 8 bucks) they were carne asada, red chili and green chili and I topped them with spicy sauce, onions, jalapenos and cilantro.  They have a fresh salsa bar too that offers sauces from the mild to hot, I went with a spicy green sauce and some jalapenos and spicy carrots, those carrots are my favorite!  The tacos were perfect! Just what I was craving! The red chli was the mildest of the group, next time I will double up on the green chili. The carne asada was perfectly cooked and had good flavor. The green chili, hunny that has a punch of heat to your face, I LOVE IT!!   If you haven't been to Maskadores Taco Shop, you have to go! Its set up like chipotle ordering style, and they have plenty of seating. Go try them out!"}
{"text":"I love tacos, no really, if I had to eat one item for the rest of my life, it would no doubt be tacos, hard tacos, soft tacos, chicken tacos, beef tacos, veggie tacos, you name it I will eat it! Love me some tacos.   So I had been hearing some buzz from friends about Mucha Lucha Tacos, how they have great street tacos and some hot hot sauces (for me the hotter the better baby! ) so I knew it would only be a matter of time before I checked them out!  When I got their I noticed its so of the same set up as chipotle/café rio style of ordering, and after I checked out the menu I went with the 5 street tacos & a bandera wet burrito.  For the tacos, they were red chili chicken, green chili beef and carne asada all topped with cheese, cilantro, pico de gallo and hit with some of their extra hot sauce. OMG SO DANG GOOD! My lips and my mouth were on fire, but I did not care! Each taco had their own great flavor, but I think next time I will skip out on the carne asada and keep with the green chili beef & red chili chicken. It's not that that carne aside isn't good; it's just not as hot as the other meats.  It was the mild ones of the group.  The Bandera wet burrito I got with green chili beef, rice, whole beans & veggies wrapped in a fresh tortilla topped with green and red sauce & jalapeno cream cheese sauce and also topped with some of the extra hot sauce. OMG this was a huge burrito and also lunch for the next day. I think sitting overnight allowed it to get even hotter, LOVE IT SOO MUCH!!!   Mucha Lucha Tacos do not skip out on the heat, and I love that!  They also have a great little salsa bar and hot carrots and jalapenos too, omg heaven!  Go get you some tacos!"}
{"text":"Incredibly tasty. It was actually a bummer to me how good it was, as I now know where the majority of my spare money will be spent. Five stars! I ordered the Fries Nachos which are essentially carne asada fries.... however you can choose any of the plethora of protein they have to top your fries. added beans, peppers, grilled onions, jalapeno cream cheese(wow), pico de gallo and sour cream. topped with their delicious red & green sauces, i'm upset that i'm not eating it right now. my girlfriend ordered street tacos and her sister got a carne asada burrito. i had to try both - and i was really happy with it all. let me say this one thing - nachos fries are the WAY TO GO, period. I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"My dad & I wanted to get some burritos & stopped here because I was in the neighborhood..the chorizo burrito I got was SO good!!! my dad was surprised to how soft the meat was! He got a carne asada burrito! I will definitely be coming back. The only thing that sucked was they didn't have aguas but still deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Freakin delicious meats and sauces. Best tacos in Tempe. A must on your list, especially if you like real Hot Salsa and Jalapeño Cream! Try everything."}
{"text":"Gaw Damm!  I went in and got 3 assorted flour tacos and 2 burritos, all diff meats and holy shit can i say i found my go to spot for Tempe!  And super friendly! Defiantly will return!!!  Keep it up and thanks!"}
{"text":"The other reviewers have pretty much nailed it. I had the burrito with barbacoa, and it was better than the same thing at Chipolte (which is good itself). The food was fresh, plentiful, and tasty! I am glad Yelp turned me onto this place not too far from the office!"}
{"text":"I still haven't quite found a good Mexican food spot in Arizona. This is my second year back and while i did find some things enjoyable about Mucha Lucha Taco Shop I still didn't think it was anything to brag about. I ordered a Grilled Fish burrito (it was Friday and it's lent go figure). I was disappointed to hear that they were out of the Fried Fish Burrito and it was only 6pm. The fish for the Grilled Fish looked a little suspect I want to say it was Cod, but It wasn't the best looking fish. The burrito itself was quite big, but it didn't have much taste to it. There was some red hot sauce in it that was super spicy and kind of disguised the whole thing. They do give you chips, but it's not that much. Overall, the staff was friendly and I liked the whole Luchador theme of the shop. My girlfriends Shrimp burrito was much better (yeah I took some bites). I wouldn't mind giving this spot one more go next time I'm in the area to give it my final judgement."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying this place out for the first time today. Really great choice if you want some fresh and flavorful Mexican Food.   After choosing what you want to eat you can decide what ingredients you want inside the same way you would at a Chipotle. My friend ordered four street tacos ($5.59) and I ordered the wet burrito (~$8). We were really impressed by the various types of meats they offered here, I think there was about 5 or 6. My friend got each of his tacos a different flavor and then the man working, who I think was the owner let us sample the flavors we didn't get. We both agreed that all of them were amazing. Watch out for the green chili though, the spice tends to sneak up on you! My wet burrito was also fantastic. However I will probably switch to the pork next time instead of the red chicken and pass on the roasted corn.   As we were getting ready to leave the owner asked us if it was our first time there and if we enjoyed the meal. We meant it when we said we would be coming back! Overall we were really happy with the food and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE we ate here today we go here every week order between 5 & 10 burritos or tacos  everyone of my crew loves this place  best Horchata (taste homemade)  wish they had online ordering and delivery   take some Carne Asada and some Shrimp and boom best surf and turf burrito EVER!!!  thank you for making amazing food   will add photos  guys over at Extreme Micro"}
{"text":"Very good food.  The staff was very friendly and cared about how we liked the food.  They gave us samples to taste and were very genuine.  4 stars instead of 5 simply for the ambiance.  It's just a self serve taqueria."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of excellent. The food is cooked right in front of you. They use all fresh ingredients, excellent flavors, spicy! Look out for the grilled jalapeños in the salsa bar! Also, I love the decor and the people that work here. Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food places are those who are authentic and don't pander to Americans' opinions of what Mexican food should be; e.g.,  those god-awful wet burritos served in the Midwest that contribute to the obesity of those States yet taste like bovine excrement.  I have been pulled into Chipotles 3 or 4 times during business trips, and they are the lowest of the low to me.  Mucha Lucha however is an amazing, fresh alternative to the pseudo-Mexican outlets that blanket our metro area like a greasy wet burrito.  No grease smell like another popular Mexican place in Fountain Hills that makes me sick to my stomach to step in their front door. Mucha Lucha uses fresh ingredients and good meat, with an OCD focus on cleaning the kitchen and patron area.  I can't think of a better Mexican restaurant within 250 miles of Mucha Lucha Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Today was my second dining experience at this best-kept secret in my neighborhood.  I was raised on Mexican food and Sombrero's is the real deal:  Authentic. Mexican. Street-Style Servings.  The proteins (chicken, beef, pork) are slow cooked in their chile sauces--oh muh goodness, People...  First-timers: I recommend the 5 Street Tacos, this way you can sample most of their proteins & chile flavors (5 small tacos = really filling). It's a small, super casual joint with bright, colorful walls.  They have 10-15 small tables, a salsa bar, and a simple, straightforward menu.  Fantastic service as well: really nice, patient employees/owners.  Only recommendation is that they label their salsa's (mild, hot, etc) on the salsa bar."}
{"text":"For months, my best friend and I have been looking for a great street taco place to get our taco fix. We need look no further. We tried out Maskadores (formerly Mucha Lucha) and. minds. blown. Their tinga chipotle chicken and red carnitas were far and away our favorites. Tons of flavor, though the tinga was decidedly spicy (not for the faint of heart). The red chicken, vinagretta chicken, carne asada, and plain carnitas were also good, but just not quite as full-flavor.   The price is fantastic--$7.50 for five street tacos, and cheese, lettuce, pico, cilantro, onions, corn, sour cream, and salsas are all included in that price (which is a steal!). The ginormous Mexican cokes are only $2.25. They also gave us complimentary chips with jalapeño cream cheese. It's to die for--we just wanted more chips to finish it off. The restaurant itself is small, but with plenty of seating. It's also very clean and neat, with soft music in the background. So for about $10, you get an awesome meal that is plenty filling. Definitely coming back to this one."}
{"text":"If you want the hottest food in fountian hills and possibly all phoenix this is the spot! Thr green Chile beef needs no salsa! It will light you up! The asada was to be rivaled. Now come the salsas...... after trying bother the green and red, I was sweating and my friends were laughing and loving it. I couldn't tell which was hotter cause I couldn't feel my mouth after the first few bites! Haha. So I go and ask the staff which one is hotter, and they had the best response.... \"both!\" They said. I couldn't stop laughing myself!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food! Friendly staff & a cute environmental! So glad to have a new place to go in Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a clean, authentic, inviting Mexican restaurant Maskadores should be your first stop. Maskadores is a Lucha Libre themed atmosphere with bright colored walls accompanied by great service. The menu ranges from Crunchy tostadas, to flavorful flour street tacos, and my favorite the wet Bandera burrito.  As you enter Maskadores you are greeted by their very polite employees. Maskadores models a Chipotle, or Qdoba order system. The flavorful options are listed above and then as you move through the line you can completely customize your choice to your personal preference. There truly is nothing better than making your meal exactly how you want it. This model also reduces the wait time of your food. Unless you hit a lunch rush you should move through the line and have your food in a matter of minutes.  When I venture to Maskadores, which is fairly frequently, I usually decide between the Wet Bandera Burrito or the Super Fries. The Wet Bandera is filled with your choice of meat, canre asada, chicken, shrimp, barbacoa, etc... Rice and beans are next, and then your very hard decision salsas and all other typical Mexican burrito fillings. The thing that sets this burrito apart from all others is its enchilada style serving and their special jalapeno cheese sauce on top. This sauce is incredible. With my burrito I chose the carne asada route which is cooked on the grill in front of you to a flavorful mouthwatering perfection. I then decided on white rice and pinto beans which are always my preferred preference. Next, I stuffed the burrito with their habanero salsa, which is eye watering hot, so steer clear if you're are not looking for a spicy kick. I then followed the salsa up with sour cream which was a great consistency, not too runny and not too thick, and lettuce and cheese. All this is stuffed in a tortilla that was waiting on the grill so it is nice and warmed. Once the burrito is rolled I had it draped in the more Habanero hot sauce and jalapeno cream cheese. WARNING: This burrito is huge!  All in all, Maskadores is my favorite Mexican food place in the valley. The prices are reasonable but not cheap. I found the quality of food is well worth the few extra dollars over other authentic Mexican restaurants. I would highly recommend Maskadores to anyone searching for a go to Mexican restaurant. I tend to stick to my favorites at Maskadores, but I have taken many people there who have tried most other things on the menu and everyone has absolutely loved it. Maskadores offers a family friendly environment, displays the Mexican culture in a fun extravagant way, and greets you with very kind, inviting employees. The food is wonderful and cooked in front of you. It leaves you full excited for the next trip back. In conclusion, I would give Maskadores a 4.9 star out of 5 star simply because I'm always looking for somewhere better, but after my experience at Maskadores I'm not sure I will find any better."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food.  However, it is no country for old men as all the meat and salsas are insanely hot !"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I didn't have any of the meat here. People say the carnitas are amazing.   Like most people say, this place can be hard to find--it's on Broadway and Hardy right across the street from the industrial district. It has a yellow sign that says \"Taqueria\" on it. Why it doesn't say Sombreros, we'll never know.   I had a vegetarian burrito which came with corn, rice, black beans (of which you get to choose from two types of bean), lettuce, and some spicy sauce they had. You also get to choose from a chipotle, spinach, flour, or corn tortilla. I had the spinach and it was very tasty. Came with a side of some old, forgettable tortilla chips as well. The total was 6 bucks EXACTLY, which made the OCD part of my brain shiver with delight. You might refer to this place as a cheaper, possibly healthier \"Chipotle.\"   The decorations and furnishings inside are nice, modern with a touch of old-world Mexico. The three ladies working behind the counter lend the place a very authentic feel--it's quite obvious these three have made a LOT of tortillas in their lifetimes.   Unfortunately it only gets 3 stars. Maybe in South Dakota or Iowa, or any place that doesn't have 3 great Mexican restaurants within spitting distance like Tempe, AZ this restaurant would merit an extra star."}
{"text":"Tinga chicken tacos amazing!  Hole in the wall place. Everything is authentic and tastes homemade!"}
{"text":"Another great find here...thanks Yelpers! My family stopped in while visiting ASU. Loved the quesadillas and burritos. Tried carne asada, tinga chicken and carnitas meats and also homemade horchata."}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent, fresh food and friendly service--one of my favorite lunch destinations.  First, finding this place was a bit tricky the first time I went. It's in the middle of a strip mall and has a very small sign that says \"Taqueria\" rather than \"Mexican Grill\". Thankfully, I ended up in the right place, because I love the food. I walked in and found the place to be rather crowded. It's a small place with only a few tables. If they keep making food this good, they're going to have to figure out something for a bigger space, in my opinion. But of course, the disco ball is an essential element!  There are a number of options: burritos, street tacos, open burritos, tostadas, etc. Once you pick generally what you're ordering, you pick the ingredients that will go on top of or inside whatever you're ordering. I've had the open burrito both times I've gone, and I've been really happy with the results.  The red chili chicken and chicken tinga are both tasty. They have them pre-prepared when you arrive, but they heat them up on the skillet. You can choose rice, beans, cheese, sauce, and a variety of toppings like cilantro, pico, etc. The guacamole is pretty solid, although I never like how expensive guacamole is priced as a side at restaurants (side complaint). And as far as the tortilla options go, you can choose a bunch of different types: corn, corn/flour mix, flour, wheat, and they're all good. The open burrito comes with tortilla or chips, if you so desire.  After all that, there's a salsa bar with limited, but excellent, options. The spice level is excellent, and the flavor is as well.  The service is very friendly. They're happy to help you through your order, and they even checked on me as I ate my food, even though there aren't really \"servers\" in the restaurant.  I'l be back many times in the future, because I love the setup of this place, and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating here for the first time. I had a burrito and my wife had the street tacos and the verdict is...amazingly tasty and seriously spicy. This place is a winner winner taco dinner!!!"}
{"text":"I fully admit that I am a taco snob. If I had to pick only one food to eat for the rest of my life it would be tacos. I say that only so you can fully understand the truthfulness when I say these were THE BEST TACOS IN MY LIFE! Even my husband agreed. We were in town for a conference and I checked to see what was around. Usually I take high ratings with only 33  reviews with a bit of doubt, but I was glad to be proven wrong. I had the street tacos with barbacoa and the flavor was perfection. Only downside is that we live across the country and can't come here every day to eat."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy! This ain't no Senior Taco or Chipolte, this is street tacos done right and with lots of flavor, making it worth the ever so slightly higher price tag. Pick your preferred meat from behind the counter, they'll cook it up fresh and then add all the yummy ingredients you want to choose. I had a burrito bowl with yummy small corn tortillas on the side. My friend went for the street tacos. This stuff has some spice. I got the chicken vinaigretta without spice but the mild salsa added just the right amount of kick for me. The owner was there and was a little cranky and not wanting to make any suggestions for me, which I didn't particularly like, but the food was so good that it didn't matter. The rest of the staff was incredibly kind and helpful."}
{"text":"Thank you YELP posters that rated this \"hole on the wall\" restaurant, like so many other \"hole in the wall\" favorites, this is a sure winner. He even spotted that I had never been here before and offered me samples of the different spicy beef and chicken. I strongly recommend the chicken for its abundant flavor without being \"hot\". The beef had a nice kick to it with two flavorful versions. I had a chicken burrito as well as one of the spicy beef burritos.  Don't be fooled by the location, go in and try the great food. I am also a fan of the real sugar soft drinks from Mexico, the strawberry was a perfect compliment to the rich Mexican style food. The condiment bar is well stocked with a variety of great flavors to enhance your dining pleasure. I think I have to go now, my wheelbarrow just arrived to get me back to my vehicle.  Overall you will not be disappointed!! Happy feasting!!"}
{"text":"We ate here last evening based on the overly positive Yelp reviews. The food was fantastic, and it must be the recipes, because we have never tasted anything quite like it. We tried the 5 street taco dish with various meats (green chilies so nice), the shrimp quesadilla, and even sampled a chicken taco as an after meal treat. The tortilla chips are made fresh and go wonderfully well with the jalapeno cream cheese!"}
{"text":"I found ut to be overpriced for the small quantity of food received. For instance, I was charged $1.25 for two small spoonfuls of guacamole on my tostoda."}
{"text":"Place is bomb, if you like bowls def go here, this is the spot I take people when they come from out of town"}
{"text":"I love this place, we have been going for a while and have tried a few different items.  I am always torn on what to order as I love the 3 flour tacos, the nachos or burrito.  The barbacoa is my favorite (it is a bit spicy but not too much).  The staff is always friendly and really great, during the lunch rush it gets packed and there isn't much room for sitting."}
{"text":"Very authentic! Food is fresh and tasty  also inexpensive. I tried the tostadas there and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Ok...so we fly in to Phoenix from Baltimore and the first thing I do is YELP a great local Mexican style restaurant to fuel the tank. Mucha Lucha got great reviews at a reasonable price so I said \"let's go!\"  It did not disappoint!! My wife and I and three of our kids (21, 17, and 14) ALL said the same thing - THIS IS AWESOME!!! Best quesadilla on the planet! The breakfast bowl was amazing! Satisfied my need for spicy-hot too!! And the staff was great - made us try to speak in Spanish too! Fun!!  A LITTLE hole in the wall with BIG TASTE!!! LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"Cool luchadores decorations, ambiance. Got the street tacos and they were pretty good!"}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong here if you're looking for a giant wet burrito. The one I got was so big it fed me for 3 meals. There's plenty of parking and you can sit outside, which was ideal for me as a visitor from rainy Seattle!"}
{"text":"Great place. Ingredients were tasty and our burritos were made to order. The owner was super friendly and welcoming and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely as good as it gets when it comes to simple Mexican staples such as tacos and burritos, made to perfection.  For an average of $7, you can enjoy a build your own burrito, chips, and home-made horchata.  Build with savory selections such as barbacoa, green chile, chicken, or carnitas.  They have all of the fresh ingredients of your choice such as cilantro, roasted corn, pinto and black beans, shredded oaxacan cheese, and pico de gallo.   The beauty of this little gem is you are choosing what goes into your dish.  I had the ambrosial barbacoa with pinto beans, a heaping of fresh cilantro, a medium hot salsa, and generous dollops of their signature jalapeno cream cheese.  The savory combined with the salty and spicy, balanced by the fresh and citrus-like flavor of the cilantro made this a phenomenal burrito.  On the menu are also fresh soft and crispy tacos, and tostadas.  Highly recommended not only for the flavors, but the cleanliness and friendliness of this Taqueria."}
{"text":"Amazing food! By far one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been too and definitely the best in Fountain Hills! The location isn't that good so make sure you check them so that we can ensure they continue to stay open through the summer! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I got the veggie burrito, which was delicious. They had great flavored sauces that were fun to try. The other people with me got a taco salad and that adds.  They also enjoyed their food. The price was great! About $6 each. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Solid food, tasty and palate pleasing. Staff friendly and helpful. Looking forward to the new one in Gilbert soon!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican place in the whole valley! Awesome, awesome, awesome food! The tacos are amazing. Chicken tinga is my fav, such good spices. Good prices, cute little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"This is authentic Mexican food - you can build your own dinner from a wide selection of ingredients right at the counter.  I recommend trying the street tacos.  You get 5 and design your own flavors, textures and sauces.  Terrific."}
{"text":"A couple of notches above your standard taco shop, featuring  a multitude of delicious condiments you don't see in most places. Beware of a little heat, some things are fiery hot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Everyone that I have introduced to this place has become a loyal customer. Their meats are more authentic than any other casual/fast food restaurant. Also, the prices are decent. Try the jalapeños yummy."}
{"text":"I had the Bandera burrito (see photo), amazing flavor and each salsa was amazing. The barbacoa chicken was delicious inside as well. Definitely authentic Mexican food and great service... Soon they'll have margaritas too!"}
{"text":"I had tacos with each of the regular meat options. All were very delicious. My friend got the asada quesadilla and a wet burrito, he loved both. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"The worst !  Tacos ordered with cilantro, but was piled on so high couldn't even see the tacos. Gross  Rice was just ok. Guacamole was way too bitter, too much lime.  Never again"}
{"text":"Meat and cheese tacodilla.   Definitely recommend and I'll stop by next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Comida riquísima y económica!! 5 taquitos por $7! Probé la carne asada, green chili beef y barbacoa--todas eran deliciosas. Las señoras que nos ayudaban estaban muy amables. Proba la horchata y todas las carnes. Vamos a regresar! Gracias!"}
{"text":"I was excited to come here at first. But when I tried to order a fish taco I quickly realized I mad a mistake coming here. You can't order a single fish taco only 5 of them."}
{"text":"This is what ALL Carne Asada should taste like! Tender, Flavorful, just yummy, yummy, yummy!  I've been here twice now and the first time, my 8 yo didn't want to try it but the 2nd time he was wiser and he took one of my tacos... He loved it and ate the whole taco, which was awesome 'cause the boy child never wants to eat anything decent!  I am in absolute love with the Carne Asada here. I've gotten the 3 tacos with Carne.  I was at the Enterprise down the road and it was suggested to me by them to visit this little hole in the wall eatery.   I would have never guessed, nor stopped, nor fell in love with the Carne! And one of those Green salsas is superb as well (not sure which one it is)  I highly recommend this restaurant for AUTHENTIC Mexican!   Definitely, definitely eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, makes burritos right in front of you. It is worth every penny. Go carne asada burrito with wheat tortilla."}
{"text":"Good quality Mexican food for the price! You'd think that being so close to Mexico we'd have more options for a good place to \"echarse un taco.\" This place hit the spot!!! We went for lunch and there we a lot of people and the poor lady's were slammed. Regardless, they smiled and were very polite. The food tasted amazing and had a very authentic taste. I loved that their salsa was actually spicy and they also had a milder option. And no I'm not talking about the salsa bandera. This place has great food. If I could say one critic is that these poor ladies need some help with someone charging/cleaning. Well at least during the peak hours. Other than that, great little gem in Tempe! I will surely return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down five stars excellence. The staff is friendly, kinds, and helpful. The space is clean and fresh with fun paintings on the wall. The food the SO YUMMY tacos, quesadillas, burritos, fresh ingredients, vegetarian options, house made tortillas um yes please!!!! AAAAAA+++++"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Affordable and healthy portions of food. I had the nachos they were awesome. My fiancé had the 5 street tacos you can mix and match the meat for each taco!"}
{"text":"Fast service!  It's a good sign when you run out of chips before you run out of toppings on your nachos.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  On the higher price end for fast Mexican food but we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Could've gone 4 stars but my wife doth protest. Too much \"mystery meat\" and no ambience whatsoever. But I'm a guy, this is a taco bar. From a previous review, someone had commented on the jalapeño cream cheese... incredible! I ordered the street tacos and they were delightful.  Still exploring, probably won't go back here.on the quest for the best Mexican cuisine - perhaps a taco bar is not Nirvana."}
{"text":"Scored the street tacos...Chipotle Tinga Chicken, Carne Asada, and Green Chili Beef. All the tacos were very very tasty! Can't wait to go back and try something else. Doesn't get more legit than Mucha Mucha Taco Shop."}
{"text":"Got a breakfast burrito with machaca and it didn't disappoint! Tasty!! Filling! Staff was very nice. Restaurant was very clean. Hot sauce was nice and spicy. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Blown away !! Excellent food !! Definitely would come back . Thank you yelp for such a delicious lunch . Wonderful staff very Pleasant ! Great place to eat, and to top it off great prices! A++ highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've eaten here once a week four weeks in a row. I really have nø other words tø describe it. And the people are super nice. Small place."}
{"text":"I am in absolute awe of this place. I had the 5 Street Tacos and they are to die for. Their sauces are so amazing and their HOT salsa is actually HOT. I would give this place 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Definitely just drive up and buy everything. We had the Nacho fries, bomb, a wet burrito, super bomb, barbacoa tacos, extra bomb, and the red chili carnitas, also super bomb. They have a great salsa bar and a bunch of options to add to your meats. Great place for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!  Had tacos and nachos.....superb!  Vinegar chicken was awesome!  Will be back for the margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"Echoing the other 5 star reviews of this new taco shop! The service was quick, staff extremely friendly and food was great.   We tried the rolled tacos (green chicken) and shredded beef nachos. They also let me try the chicken tinga meat. It was amazing!  Please support this local shop! We will be back.  Only con: not much for kids with little spice."}
{"text":"With no shortage of Taco shops in the area, this place is definitely doing it right.  I was visiting from out of town and made a point of having tacos at least once a day!  This was hands down my favorite!  Street tacos were bomb!  They cook to order and have somewhat of a Chipotle style line for assembly, but this is a far cry from Chipotle (BTW) I don't hate Chipotle but this place beats the pants off of them.  The 2 star down review either likes chi chi's, chilis or hit them on an off day.  Other orders at my table included a barbacoa bowl and nachos with carne asada, I didn't try either but heard nothing but praise from my table."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and was impressed!!! Staff was super nice and food was just delicious!! Authentic Mexican food for sure! Carne Asada fries and tacodillas were to die for! Not to mention that delicious churro I had after"}
{"text":"So amazing! I saw the reviews on yelp and decided to try it out on my lunch break. I am burrito fanatic and usually go to Los Favoritos or Chipotle. This is seriously like Chipotle meets a little old Mexican grandmother! Haha! If you love Mexican food with a good spice and bold flavors definitely check it out! You will not be disappointed. The jalapeño cream was the business. Make sure you throw that in your burrito too!"}
{"text":"Today, I had the wet burrito with carne Asada.  They generously load the inside with rice, whole beans and veggies of your choice in addition to cheese.  Warning:  the red sauce poured over the burrito has a kick.  I suggest sampling it first if you don't like spicy!    I was disappointed with their cheap plastic forks and knives.  It made eating the burrito a challenge.  Overall a good meal.  People line up out the door at lunch, thus the 4.5 star rating.  I however only award it 3 stars!"}
{"text":"It's places like this that give meaning to the term 'hidden gem.' You can barely see the sign for Sombrero's from the street - probably why I've passed it a million times and never really noticed it. Luckily for me it came up on Yelp when I was looking to satisfy my craving for Mexican!  I stopped in around dinnertime. It wasn't very busy so I was able to just walk right up to the counter. The women working were very friendly and more than willing to walking through the different meat options.  I got a burrito bowl with carnitas. Like Chipotle, they let you choose what you want in your bowl. I was a little worried t first because the carnitas looked like they might be spicy (they were in a red sauce). But actually they were not hot, just very flavorful. The meat was really tasty, the other ingredients tasted fresh and the bowl came with a small side of chips which were perfect for scooping up my bowl ingredients. I can see why their nachos are so popular. Something about their chips make them great with toppings.  This place is the real deal. Good portions and good prices. Plus they have awesome murals on the wall. I only wish they hadn't run out of churros! Oh well, there's always next time!"}
{"text":"Tacos were great!!!!! Such a nice little spot and beats any of the taco place in this area!!!! Our son LOVED their nachos! We will be back"}
{"text":"It's an exciting new idea in town to have a specific taco experience. My only wish is to add enchiladas to the menu as their sauces for the meats were excellent!! My family of 8 is easily satisfied with these menu options."}
{"text":"Had to have my fill of this wonderful place.  Everything continues to be very good from the customer service (the 3 ladies always so nice) to the food.  This time I tried the Bandera Wet Burrito.  Both the green & red sauce were nicely season and a nice kick to it.  So many times, the green is tame, but this place makes it so there is still flavor & a nice kick.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, with good portions for a good price. The restaurant was clean and the decor was fun. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST! Chipotle-style build your own meal, but 10x more authentic and 10x better. They have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. The employees were so sweet and friendly. I got a vegetarian burrito bowl and it was BOMB. Best food in Fountain Hills in my opinion. Reasonable prices and options for very spicy and delicious salsa. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the rave reviews and the comment that this is \"authentic Mexican food\". It's a Chipotle with a different decor. You stand in a line and pick the type of meat, veggies, etc as you watch them scoop it up with an ice cream scooper. I'm not sure what's authentic about food in metal containers sitting for who knows how long? There are a lot of other choices out there that cook your food fresh.  This is just like any fast food place in my opinion. Not horrible but not the best and not authentic. Nothing special about this one.  Sorry..."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Little hole in the wall that looks like it is probably family owned. Does not look like much from the outside, however, the inside is very cute. Not very big and nothing fancy, but we didn't mind. You order at the counter and it follows the Chipotle concept. The barbacoa meat is out of this world! Very flavorful. I also tried their famous jalapeno cream cheese on my nachos and I would highly recommend it. My fiance tried the 3 chicken variety street tacos + 1 carne asada taco and he said that they were the best street tacos that he has found in Arizona. Overall very happy with the food. We loved everything that we got. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great taco shop! Get the carna asada tacos. Squeeze some limes on them and add some salt to top it off. Perfection!  One of the best taquerias ever. All our coworkers can always agree on this place. Price is very reasonable so we always come here for lunch."}
{"text":"Ah-mazing.   Tried this place for the last time yesterday and was blown away. It's just a little taco shop in a strip mall. I live across the street from this place and wouldn't have noticed it except the big taco truck parked out front.   This place is seriously delicious. I got a burrito enchilada style and the put red enchilada sauce on half and green enchilada sauce on the other half, topped with cheese and sour cream and it was to die for. My husband got rolled tacos that were loaded with everything you can imagine on top and they had so much flavor! Going back to try the street tacos and burrito bowl next time. Everything is customized to exactly how you want it from the type of food, to the meat, to the toppings.   Seriously so in love."}
{"text":"Stopped here to get some authentic Mexican tacos. First thing to note is they are Cash Only!! My date luckily had cash on him. I did the 5 tacos for $7.50-8. They're tiny little tacos but they stuff those bad boys. You can pick 3 out of 5/6 different flavored meats, I got carne, pork, & chicken. And add toppings like onions, cheese, cilantro, sour cream, etc. I must say they are very flavorful. Added some of the creamy green sauce they offer on the side for added flavor and kick. Definitely authentic and get a good amount for your buck here. Would definitely come back. Just wish they took Card and served margaritas lol"}
{"text":"Welp this place trumps most other burrito places by far.  Service was quick and to the point, food was delish and the atmosphere was  just what I would expect from a hole in a wall mexican grille. Totally loved it. Got the red pork and my bro got the carne asada and woofed down. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but certainly not deserving of 4.5 stars. The staff is nice enough but it's difficult to communicate. I asked for a wet burrito and the woman behind the counter repeated my order back to me so I knew it was correct. She then went on to forget to make my burrito \"wet\". Also they were out of sauce, forks and napkins. I was expecting the food to be pretty authentic based on reviews, but was sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot in Tempe. Hands down the best tacos I've had in Arizona since I've moved here. The meat is seasoned so deliciously and the drinks are perfect. It's pretty packed from 11:30-1:00 so if you are in a rush then call ahead. The decor inside is great too! Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"This place is great. I found it through yelp by being in the area and was initially skeptical from outside appearance.  I've been here a handful of times now and have not been disappointed yet.  Food is tasty, fresh and the staff is very helpful and always nice.  I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been here two times and the tacos are pretty docent. Nice little place with very cool luchador paintings on the walls."}
{"text":"Got the Barbacoa street tacos Togo. Got to choose everything I wanted on it, and they were delicious. If you are looking for some good street tacos this is definitely the place."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Just tried it for the first time and I am impressed. I ordered a asada burrito with everything in it. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Mexican food. Since it was my first time they gave me a free sample of their jalepeno cream cheese and it was soooooo good. The serrano pepper sauce was my favorite. Great new spot that I will be and quite often since it's so close to my work. Give it a try! You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"I was kind of disappointed. 3 hard shelled tacos. The shells were just boxed kind my mom uses. You get no sides. You can buy chips it looks like. That with a very small drink was $10.50. The ordering process is very slow. I was behind a family with 5 kids. You order like a Subway. Point at what you want. I am confused by all the great reviews. Not saying it is bad. I just feel it is pricey for what you get. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? BTW my mouth is in fire!!! Be careful with the sauce. Wish they would have told me. I will prob try again. But first impressions are average at best."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS OF MY LIFE!! I keep coming back because its too amazing, and I am very picky about my Mexican food. I always get the 5 street tacos with asada beef, and you can add as many toppings as you like for free! My friend tried a shredded beef burrito once and loved it. The inside is decorated in a super fun/colorful theme and their menu is bright and beautifully displayed overhead on flat screen TVs. I am always raving about this place, it is SO BOMB!"}
{"text":"Three of us came by here for dinner so we could check out the new kid on the block.  Interesting decor, wish they had a menu that told if some of the history.  BTW, only menu is posted on wall.  Ordering is similar to the way Chipotle runs things, beginning from the left as you build your creation and flowing toward the register where you can order extras, drinks, and pay. It seemed sorta chaotic last night as two or three people tried to put together our order.  Hearing options got kinda difficult when inquiring with person prepping and another stepping in to inform us (builder of burrito and person ordering).  Woman cooking took her cue from the lady giving instructions and our meal was being prepped with items that weren't requested.  I figured i could handle it and dismissed the extra additions because I didnt want to start again.   Once at the register to pay I inquired about cocktails since there really isn't a menu outlining the different items and prices.  It wasnt very clear but i was able to determine that they do have regular Margaritas, but none are served in that giant glass that could serve four. So at least I got that one thing clarified.  :^/ Paid, took our food, sat, and waited for our drinks. And waited. We were half way through our meal when drinks finally made it to the table.   The drinks were just \"okay\".  I'm certainly not going to make a trip there just for one of their Margs.  Truth is, i drink Margaritas regularly, so I think I am a fair judge.   They have a salsa bar with various sauces, but no labels.  Now that is a gamble. I'll forewarn you, that green pureed veggie is not Guacamole, it's Jalapenos.  Pureed Jalapeno salsa.  Not sure they should even call it salsa since it taste like straight jalapenos.  If you like the heat they've got a salsa for that.  And a fyi, the red sauce is actually milder than the green sauce too. Was gonna give 3 stars but my digestive track felt very unsettled the next morning and family member experienced similar."}
{"text":"We order from here regularly by pick up and delivery and it's always great food. It's a guilty pleasure because they give you so much food and it can be a little spicy so be careful with adding salsas but everything is delicious. We're completely addicted and this is our go-to taco shop."}
{"text":"Man, I was looking forward to this place.  Today I was finally in the area and decided to give it a go.  Maybe I didn't order the right thing?  Idk.  I got a carnitas burrito and I just thought it was really bland.  I even had them put \"hot\" sauce in the burrito and it was completely undetectable.  I was in a hurry and the bro behind me in line was super annoying and I wasn't interested in listening to him talk any longer, so I skipped the salsa bar.  I'm a hot sauce fiend, but I hoped, based on the reviews here, that the food would hold up without having to drown each bite in salsa.  I was wrong.  Again, maybe i ordered the wrong thing, but based on today's experience I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"Wow. Another hidden gem in Phoenix. Everything is made fresh. I had the chicken nachos and they were great. Wendy had the carne asada tacos. Great food. Nice staff. Cooking food fresh. Go watch some Angels spring training and drive 2 miles and get you some tacos."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out and it was amazing. They do the ordering like chipotle but 10 times better than that place. Definitely will be back and it's so close to my apartment!"}
{"text":"How does this place have 4 stars?   Gross meat, bland guac, worse crema.   I would never go back here."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time this weekend. It had the potential to be so good, but just didn't meet my expectations. I didn't think the staff was very friendly and the food needed better descriptions. Specifically, the spice levels. I ordered a burrito bowl with green chile beef, veggies, rice, beans, jalapeno cream cheese, and some salsa. It was SO spicy I had to trash it. I like spicy food and eat it on a regular basis, but this was insane. I have no idea what made it so spicy so I won't even go back to try it again. I would recommend they indicate the spice levels on the menu items."}
{"text":"Can someone please tell me what the hours of this place are? The past 3 times I've tried to come here during their hours they have posted on multiple sites, they are closed. I am obsessed with this place but I can't seem to get food here anymore. I've also tried to call but there is no answer. I tell everyone about this place but I haven't been able to even eat here lately! Giving 5 stars because I really WANT to eat here."}
{"text":"Soooo dank!  Great prices. Great food.  Got the green pork street tacos and the banderas wet burrito with red pork and it was amazing.  Best tacos I've had here!  This will be a new regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Excellent. The man serving us was helpful and even let us try samples. The food was fantastic. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love the place! It's exactly what you expect and want. Made to order Mexican food from a counter...made fresh as you order it.  Funky decor...but perfect!"}
{"text":"Best asada meat I've ever had. All the meats are great and I'm pausing after taco number 2 to write this so I can savor the flavor. I live in San Diego (taco capitol of the US) this is greatttt!!!! Make sure to try the pepper / onion salsa st the salsa bar. Amazing!!! My new go to place for my business trips. See you next month!!"}
{"text":"OMG I love this place! It's a real authentic taco shop. The people are so nice and grateful for the business every time I drop in. The food is fresh, flavourful and hot! If you like mildly hot, plain tasting Mexican food, go to a chain restaurant. This is not your place. But if you want the real deal, don't miss Maskadores Taco Shop!!!!!!   We often come for happy hour. Great margaritas, cold beer and the fresh hot food."}
{"text":"You can't get more authentic than this! My husband lived in Mexico for 10 years and says it's just like being there. We ordered the street tacos al pastor, street tacos carnitas, and an asada quesadilla. They were all AMAZING. Great flavor, great portion sizes (quesadilla was enormous), good value. Salsa bar is on point. They have Mexican soda, beer and liquor too! We will be back OFTEN."}
{"text":"Maybe one of the best rolled tacos I have ever had. Be aware, the rolled taco is filled with potato and the meat you order is layered on top of the tacos with cheese on a bed of romaine lettuce. From there you can add stuff from their chipotle style ingredients.  I got the barbacoa beef on my tacos. It was excellent. An example of well cooked and seasoned food.   The shop is small, and has some awesome luchador wrestlers painted on the walls. Dining area was clean enough. Ladies behind the counter speak broken English well enough.  I suggest you give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews.  The reviews were right!  Great tacos and very nice people working there.  There was a large variety of meats for the tacos and the sauces are excellent."}
{"text":"Have lived in AZ for 24 years and this is now on the favorites list. Had the Street Tacos, delicious! the smoky salsa is some of the best I've tasted, you have to try this place, it's great!"}
{"text":"Went with a couple of my Teammates there. The food was good. They were making the burritos and Quesedillas from semi made ingredients. We can select the meat, beans, other ingredients like corn, sauce, cilantro, sour cream, guacamole, onions. The tortillas had options too - Flour, wheat, Spinach etc. The chips that come with the combo was good enough. The guacamole was fresh and good. The hot sauce was fresh and real hot. The people running were courteous and helpful. All in all this was a great place to have a tasty lunch. Will definitely visit again. Will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim for the first time and discovered a new favorite for take out. Not fancy but good quality, a variety of proteins, great flavor, and portion sizes. You watch them make your food tailored to your tastes. Clean restaurant, busy with customers, polite staff. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Tried flour tacos and a burrito with carne asada, super tasty!"}
{"text":"Good food good prices good service much needed in the neighborhood with all these fake expensive \"authentic\" Mexican whose menus are all faded and exactly the same and food is less than average. I'm excited to have a real place to go on Taco Tuesdays especially since they have mechaladias"}
{"text":"Congratulations!  You whole heartedly earned a one star review for your poor customer service.     My wife and I were in line waiting to order and we weren't sure what we wanted.  No one was in line behind us and after being asked what we wanted I replied that we were not ready to order.  She asked again what we wanted and I quite politely said we were not ready to order.  She asked a third time and I repeated myself in a volume that would be heard but not yelling by any stretch of the imagination.     She huffed off into the back where she stayed for about three minutes.  She came back out with cleaning supplies and proceeded to clean the line.  She proceeded to ignore us as we patiently waited in line for over 5 additional minutes as she cleaned.  When a customer finally walked in behind us she spoke over us and asked what they wanted.  Clearly she was ignoring us over what was a simple lack of clear communication most probably caused by the loud noise of the kitchen.  This was simply hilarious to watch.    The worst part about all of this was watching her attempt to clean the line.  Seeing the water from the steel scrubbing pad spill into all of the surrounding bowls of rice, meats and veggies was very sickening.  I looked at my wife to see if she was seeing what I was seeing.  We were both disgusted.    Why did we stay?  We wanted to see how long she would ignore us!  Like I said it was a pathetic attempt to punish a paying customer over your inability to hear.  Nice job, you earned this one star."}
{"text":"I rarely find a place that it so outstanding it requires a Yelp review, but I just ate dinner here and I had to come to Yelp immediately to sing its praises. I had the tinga chicken street tacos (comes with 5 tacos for $6.99 and your choice of meats.) You can mix and match up to three meats if you want to sample more flavors, but I decided to stick with just the chicken. Incidentally, I tried to order two fish and three chicken tacos, but they will not let you mix fish with the other meat choices, which was fine by me.   My son had the fish tacos (he also chose the street tacos.) You also get to choose from a variety of toppings. I stuck with the standard cilantro, pickled onions and pico, and then topped it off with a squeeze of lime, offered up at the salsa bar, and some medium salsa- not that they needed any extra flavor, but this just made it over the top delicious. My son added roasted corn and white onions to his, along with lettuce. The fish tacos also came with an optional jalapeño cream cheese, which he indulged in.   Everything on my plate was fresh and cooked to perfection. When you order, they place your portion of meat on the grill and grill it up alongside your tortillas.   I finished off the meal with a Mexican Coke. My son had the horchata, which he said he didn't love the flavor of, but it seems it just had a spice he didn't like, so I can't hold that against them.  The service was very friendly, and the staff didn't even seem to mind that we had come in roughly ten minutes before they closed (Not intentionally- I wouldn't have done that if I'd known they were closing.) They let us eat in and told us not to rush our meal. I never got the sense that we were being rushed or that anyone resented us being there.   Atmosphere is very casual, as a taco joint should be. They were playing Mexican pop music and I almost felt like I was transported to Mexico. Also, A+ on the mucha libre decorations painted on the walls and Mexican wrestling masks completing the theme."}
{"text":"Okay, it's time to update my review. In my initial review I complained about the AC - it is no longer a problem. Was there just a day or so ago and still feel the same. This place is all sorts of yummy! The staff is friendly, too!"}
{"text":"Sombrero's is everything I want in my neighborhood Mexican joint: The flavors are bold and spicy, the food is fresh, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly.  The open burrito with barbacoa is my jam. While I like Chipotle as much as the next person and appreciate their ethical/fresh choices, the open burrito from Sombrero's is MEXICAN food. One day I'll try other things (they let you sample the different meats), but my love for the barbacoa open burrito runs deep and it's hard to stray. My companion is a fan of the green chili beef, which is REALLY spicy--too spicy for me, but he's into that sort of thing.  Both of the extra hot salsas at the salsa bar (there's a green and a yellow one) are spicy and flavorful. They're not unbearably spicy, but they'll make you sweat for sure. I thought I only liked tomato-based salsas until I had these. I ignore the others (in part because I always get take-out and the more watery salsas don't travel well).  The horchata really does taste like melted ice cream. Get it.  I've probably been to Sombrero's a couple dozen times but have been too busy stuffing my face with delicious Mexican food to write this review until now. Thanks, Yelp, for helping me find my new favorite neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Rated top 10 taco shop in U.S. and I can taste why. The street tacos are amazing. I've had my share of street tacos, trying to find the best and this puts up a good fight. The hot sauce is to die for. Finally a hot sauce that will make your eyes water while still having a delicious almost smoky flavor. I can't wait to come back and try more. Maybe the sopes, tacodilla or macho fries?"}
{"text":"Strong flavors, beautifully presented and delicious.   We had two wet burritos and they have 9+ kinds of meat marinading!   One problem... Couldn't eat the whole thing... But it will make for a full lunch tomorrow.   Good prices, great value and worth a visit or two."}
{"text":"Awesome find! So much flavor in the meats and sauces. We will definitely be back. Loved the wrestling decor and casualness of restaurant. Service was great, fast and so polite and helpful."}
{"text":"best taco shop around :) went in last night for the 1st time. Service was awesome & the quality was great. They have roasted green chiles that are chopped & placed in the salsa bar that tastes just like what my dad makes at home. Will definitely be coming back for more :) authentic tastes"}
{"text":"A friend who raved about this place took me for the 5 Street Taco meal. I was very pleased with a menu of 9 meats. Awesome! I choose the Red Asada Beef and Red Carnitas Pork. Toss on some cheese, jalapeño, onion, cilantro and sour cream (yes I feel guilty, Not!) and my mouth was watering.        I enjoyed both the Hot and Hotter Salsas. Great heat but not long lasting and much thicker than what's available at most Street Taco places and trucks I've eaten at.  I look forward to trying the Green when they have it again. My friend said it was wonderful.      To be honest, if I hadn't come for the Tacos I would have had a hard time deciding on what to eat. I love a picture menu, they give you a great indicator of the food you'll get. This place has a nice one.      Final verdict:  Both meats were tender and flavorful. I could have eaten 5 more. Great food. I can't wait to try more at the location closer to my house."}
{"text":"After eating at the Fountain Hills location and loving it, I noticed this one close to my house. So when I was hungry for taco's the other night we came here.      The good: Everything was just as yummy as the place in Fountain Hills.      The better part: They had the thick Green Salsa with the perfect heat that my friend had bragged about that Fountain Hills was out of. Wow! I can't say enough good things about that Salsa. I wish it was mandatory at every taco shop in the world.      The Bad: There is none. Even the Enchilada Sauce has a great kick to it.      So in my photos, what you see is what you get. Lots of meat choices. Even more than I thought. Like 15 choices. I forgot to count. And Shrimp.      4 kinds of Salsa. Medium Hot (rather thin and bland. Green and Thick with a wonderful Kick, (HOT). Hot which looked good but I wanted the Green. And Very Hot which made my eyes water just thinking about it. OK, just kidding. I like it hot but I still like to taste my food.      They have allot of choices and you can't go wrong no matter what you choose. It's all wonderful!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for tacos but wanted something authentic. Found this upon a quick yelp search for something near by and omg was it good. I got the street tacos with chicken and carne asada and my bf got the rolled tacos. We were both satisfied. It wasn't heavy and salty but it was flavorful! Def coming back to this hidden gem in FH."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid. They take the Chipotle-style approach to Mexican food but provide a much more authentic feel. You choose your tacos/burrito/bowl/etc and add ingredients as you wish, but when you choose a meat they scoop it up and grill it to order. Whatever meal you choose it is complimented by chips and a bar full of a wide array of sauces, most of which are must tries.   Service is usually pretty good, however it's price is the one draw back that stops me from making it a standard lunch spot. After a main entree and a drink I'm above my usual price range for lunch, but the food is always worth recommending."}
{"text":"Their wet burrito is everything that's good in the World! Fresh ingredients and well seasoned. They only lost a star because they lost my order and I had to wait while they made it on the spot. Though they were pretty quick."}
{"text":"Better than Chipolte anyday!!! For $10 my wife and I got stuffed. The staff was friendly and best of all no long lines (yet). Real Mexican food (not corporate). Fresh food and the Horchata is homemade (best I ever had)."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Relied on the great yelp help (So many 5 stars) We shared the 5 taco plate with asada & red carnitas. Also shared the Barbacoa taquito plate. The food was served in less than 5 minutes. The meat was not served hot. I noticed the taquitos were not freshly made. Everything seemed pre-made, pre-cooked. Potatoes in taquitos were dry. The food was served cold. Will not return."}
{"text":"The wife and I hit up this place for a quick lunch. The staff was friendly and helpful. The eating area was clean, but the decor left a little to be desired. The lucha libre masks seemed a little childish.  The food, however, was most tasty. I had a quesadilla with steak. It was well made with fresh ingredients. My wife had the street tacos and she was able to \"special order\" them to her liking.  I would recommend stopping for some tacos or a burrito. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"very good food and nice friendly people behind the counter the jalapeno cream cheese is so spicy good"}
{"text":"Chipotle sauce= bomb.com!! For the price of mainstream mexican food you get moms cooking, healthienr and less greasy! and fresh guac, cant beat that! Make it how you want it and leave with a happy tummy! Only weird (for me) thing is everything is shredded, but does make the meat juicier."}
{"text":"This place has Amazing food and great service. If your close to fountain hills you need Roy stop in and try it."}
{"text":"Never been here before, decided to try it out. Its a small place decorated with Mucha Lucha everywhere. It has a little food bar where you pick your meat and toopings. I got the street tacos just regular carnitas with the usual toppings. It was good... Not anything spectacular from any other place... I did however see them making a burrito for the guy in front of me and holy moly that thing was huge!!! The prices are pretty typical. Its not somewhere I'd go out of my way for but I'd go back. It was clean, fast and staff was nice."}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is Chipotle on steroids. They just opened this location a couple weeks ago and I'm so happy it's near by! The atmosphere is fun with mexican wrestler masks on the walls. Customer service was great. The worker in there was super friendly, very accomadating, and you could tell she loved what she was doing. She made some awesome reccomendations, which I feel made my meal way more appetizing. I tried the Super Nachos and it is so delicious. The meat is juicy with great flavor. The tortilla chips are fresh and were perfectly fried, literally everything was fantastic. Also try the Jalepeno Cream cheese, super yummy! At the end of my meal I was completely satisfied and didn't have that heavy gross feeling when you eat greasy foods. The hubby and I are def going to be regulars!!"}
{"text":"The BEST homemade horchata EVER!! You have to try it! Everything here is clearly made with attention to detail. The cuisine is fresh and authentic!! And the prices are unbeatable. I had the carnitas burrito. It was fresh, tasty, and filling. My tummy and tastebuds were definitely satisfied. I would come here regularly if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for another good find.  Small little strip mall place but the food is full if flavor.  Lots of options and the owners were there to gives us some advice on what to try.  I had the three soft tacos with all three types of chicken, very good.  My wife had the four street tacos, variety of meats and she really liked them.  Good prices, good food, great service."}
{"text":"Best chimichanga anywhere. And HUGE! The staff is nice and the ingredients they have are epic!  I never leave hungry.   Cool neon sign too."}
{"text":"3.5/5  It's like Chipotle, but a lot better! I have eaten at other Maskadores restaurants in the past (Back when they used to be called Mucha Lucha) and wanted to try out this new location before heading to Harbor Freight nearby.  As with the other shops, you choose what preparation you want (Rolled, hard, soft tacos, burritos, burrito bowl, quesadilla, etc), pick your protein (Or go veg), and choose your toppings. I had the rolled tacos with vinagreta chicken. Note that the rolled tacos have a potato filling and they will put whatever protein/veg on top instead of placing the meat/veg inside.  The rolled tacos were great as always, but there didn't seem to be a lot of chicken on top of the tacos for how much I paid. The other \"filler\" ingredients were plentiful though. Side note, if you get the rolled tacos vegetarian style, the person at the counter said it will come with rice and beans instead of protein. In the past they've also included guacamole with the vegetarian option which would make it more worth the cost of ingestion (Nearly $9).   I like how there is a salsa bar with different salsa spice levels, chopped green chile, and limes.   I also indulged in a horchata since it is made in-house. It's one of the better horchatas I've had in a long time. I loved the creamy, light flavor. It was very refreshing!"}
{"text":"Design your own burrito! In a modest, slightly dingy strip mall sits Sombrero's, a small little eatery serving slow cooked, marinated meats, with your choice of various fillings and tortillas.  I stepped in today to try a tasty burrito. You have your choice of meats such as barbacoa, carnitas, carne asada, and chicken. Tortilla choices include tomato basil, chipotle, spinach, wheat, and regular flour. They offer fillings such as pinto beans, black beans, cheese, rice, lettuce, roasted corn, onions, cilantro, and salsa. Freshly made guacamole and jalapeno cream cheese can be added for an extra charge.   I opted for the barbacoa, with tomato basil tortilla, pinto beans, rice, onions, cheese, guacamole, and spicy salsa. The meat was tender and flavorful. The accompanying ingredients meshed well with the barbacoa. The spicy salsa is indeed quite hot, and packs a punch!  I also tried some horchata ($1.99), which was refreshing and creamy.  Service was friendly and cheerful. My burrito was made quickly, and check out at the cashier was easy.  Sombrero's is definitely a good place for a filling meal!"}
{"text":"Bring your mucha luchador-sized appetite and head on over to the Mesa location of Mucha Lucha! The Mesa restaurant is smaller than the Gilbert and Tempe locations but it is open later than the Tempe store (Seriously, who closes at 4 P.M. on a Saturday? Booooo). The menu is basically the same as the other locations, with your choice of base protein or vegetarian with your style of preparation (As tacos, a burrito, nachos, etc).   I went with the vegetarian style rolled tacos. The tacos themselves are filled with mashed potato and if you get it vegetarian style you get rice, beans, and guacamole included with your meal. For toppings I had cheese, pico de gallo, onions, roasted corn, pickled red onion, white sauce and chipotle sauce. I also helped myself to some condiments from the salsa bar.   The salsa bar had a few different types of salsa, fire roasted jalapenos, and lime wedges. Unlike the Gilbert location the salsas weren't labeled according to heat level. My favorite item from the salsa bar were those fire roasted jalapenos. They had a smokey deep flavor with plenty of spiciness.  The rolled tacos were an excellent combination of soft mashed potato center with crisp fried outer taco shell and I liked the beans, rice and toppings that it came with. It was such a hearty meal that I didn't miss the exclusion of protein at all.  Service was succinct but friendly.   4.5/5. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Attended the Grand Opening party and the mariachis were amazing entertainment!  We ordered 5 street tacos (pastor) and it is set up chipotle- style so you can customize to your liking! (Try chipotle sour cream!) I ordered 3 green Chile tacodillas but will order pastor next time because per usual I stole my husbands tacos! We ordered 2 margaritas and 2 tequila shots for dessert.  I wanted to return the next day because the photos on the menu make it difficult to choose.  I love when restaurants have photos of the plates for ordering, I will 100% recommend this taco shop & return."}
{"text":"5/5! Great place for Cinco de Mayo. Went back and had the 3 flour taco plate. Green Chili beef, nice green chili flavor, not spicy. Beef Barbacoa, had a little sweetness to it, loved it. Red Pork Carnitas, had a red sauce, good but not my favorite. **First visit, I have to start by saying my wife picked up the food for me so I can't comment about the salsa bar or the restaurant but my wife said some of the salsas have a kick. I did the burrito bowl with asada beef with pinto beans,roasted corn, guac, and chipotle ranch dressing. I think it was the dressing but not sure but it had a little burn to it. Just enough so you know it's there. The asada beef had a great flavor. Good portion size and came with a giant tortilla. All for $8. It tasted great and I will be going back."}
{"text":"My favorite burrito that I've ever had. This place may feel like a hole in the wall but it has plenty of regulars who all love it the same. They recently changed their name from sombrero's to mucha lucha and I love all the changes they've made. For a tiny taco shop it feels warm and authentic.  The food is greasy and beyond delicious. The salsa bar is nice and I particularly enjoy their avocado based sauce. My personal favorite meat is their barbacoa but it's all good.  If you're looking for a top-notch burrito, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Really good street tacos at a good price. As mentioned in another review, it's kinda hard to spot from the street (and the sign says Taqueria instead of Mexican Grill), but that's what gps is for. Not a lot of tables but I value delicious tacos over seating area, and you can always get your food to-go."}
{"text":"This taco shop is a revision on a street taco stand with expanded offerings. I tried the 5 street tacos for lunch. The tacos are the traditional smaller size so it takes 5 to fill up (compared to something like Waada Street taco's which are larger but still in the same range). I tried carne asada and pork in my tacos. The carne asada was excellent- juicy and nicely spiced for great flavors. The pork was good, but not surprising.  We also ordered the bandera burrito with chicken meat and wet style with red and green sauces . The chicken was juicy and tasty. It included guacamole which was fresh and tasty. The green and red sauces were both reasonable, but not surprising.  I also got a bag of chips with salsa ($2). Chips were standard. The salsas were completely emulsified, with no chunks. Not my preference, but I still wanted to try them. The mild salsa tasted smooth with a cilantro tinge. The hot was definitely strong with a bite, as was their super-hot. All of them punched with an after taste that really was the focus of the \"heat\".   Overall my impression of this place was good, with the carne asada street tacos winning for flavor. The prices seemed higher than other street taco stands such as Waada Street Taco's which I feel offers better value with excellent flavor."}
{"text":"Always tastes fresh. I love the street tacos from here and would definitely recommend anyone into Mexican to go here."}
{"text":"Ok, I have been around the block when it comes to Mexican street food, with most of my favorites coming from Juarez in the 70's.   But the carne asada street tacos with freshly roasted green chiles and cilantro--the best ever.    These ladies know what they are doing. I was so sad to have wasted my stomach and time on Wadaa in Scottsdale which somehow is supposed to be the best????  Nay nay. Drive a bit further. Go here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great staff!!! So glad I found this place, one of my new favorite restaurants in Tempe az!!!"}
{"text":"I'm just went there today, I'm visiting from Cleveland Ohio! Mannnn their food was the bomb!  I had the street tacos and they were delicious!! So good I went back for dinner too! Wonder customer service and great food! U must try!"}
{"text":"Is there such a thing as too authentic? Yes. Yes there is. How did this place get 4.5 stars on Yelp?!  Me and my boyfriend went there for nachos, just simple Mexican nachos. We ordered regular chicken nachos and just that simple request was met by a woman who speaks ZERO English... She looked at us like WE didn't know what we were talking about, but in all reality she had no damn clue what we were saying. A young man came out of the kitchen to help (obvious he knew she needed help speaking to us) and he apparently made matters worse because there was a thin layer of chicken on some crappy chips, and there was... No cheese... WHO DOESNT PUT FREAKING CHEESE ON NACHOS?! These guys. That's who.  The woman proceeded to ask us if we wanted this and that topping, we got nearly every topping and the nachos were still dry. I don't think I could've been more disappointed. Ps: the horchata was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Amazing food, been there 3 times since I heard about it. Got the Bandera Burrito (Asada) was amazing, Meat Burrito (Asada) also worth a try and the Meat Quesadilla (Tinga Chipotle Chicken) very good.   My only knock is the meat portions, when you add what you want to your selection you miss out on the meat. But still a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, ordered the three rolled tacos.  They were good, but different because there was potato inside, and the meat was on top.  But the flavor of the meat was amazing, and there was a sauce they used and it was really good.  Will be back when again for sure.  I'll try the street tacos next time."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go!!! Every looks nice.. the burrito is so hugeeee!! Yummy yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"Had to knock off a star because my order took a while (much longer than expected for fast food) and was a little wrong (it worked out because I would have had way to much food ordered anyways! The wet burrito is cheesy saucy and delicious. Fish tacos are also worth it. I added a churro for dessert and LOVED it - it was so good On its own that it didn't need the additional dipping sauce"}
{"text":"I was craving a burrito last night and didn't want to stop at the usual suspects (Chipotle/Rubio's/El Pollo Loco/Filib's), I turned to Yelp and this place came up with great reviews. I walked in to the small shop about 20 minutes 'til closing and it looked like just the owner/cook and his daughter manning the ship. I spent some time scanning the menu and when I was ready he helped take my order. I had a burrito with red chile chicken and most of the fixins. They were out of cheese for the night so I got some guacamole gratis which was nice. While the daughter was ringing me up he gave me a sample of their taquitos they have coming out which was good. I drove home and dug in to my burrito, chips and salsa, and horchata. The horchata was on par, their hot salsa is in fact hot and very good. The burrito was really good - it seemed standard before biting into it but it's very flavorful which must be a testament to the care that goes into making all of the ingredients. I'l definitely be back."}
{"text":"The variety of meat and toppings from which to choose is impressive. Think Subway meets taco shop. I am a self-proclaimed taco connoisseur and would choose this place over other joints any day. The dining area is small but I would eat these sitting on the curb if that it what it took to enjoy their food again."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the food. Tacos seemed skimpy for the prices. By skimpy they didn't have a lot of meat. I understand cost control but it looked like they were only putting .60 cents of meat on there for the 3 taco plate. Second thing was the place was dirty. I was grossed out by the condiment stand looked like no one had cleaned in a while. Over the place was a bit dingy. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my taco spot. Period. I have been to countless Mexican Food joints and this one tops them all.  The place is small, easy to drive by and miss, if it wasn't for Yelp I would have never found this gem.  If you are looking for some tacos and/or burritos GO, look no further because this is where you need to be.  The staff is incredibly friendly, they will let you sample everything.  In my case, I am in a monogamous relationship with the carne asada."}
{"text":"Been here several times and love it even more with every visit. The red chili chicken is amazing."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST Mexican place in Tempe. Menu is straightforward & has pretty much anything you could want in regard to staple dishes that are widely liked.  You order what additions you want, then go through the line of things you want on or in your dish somewhat like chipotle etc... places  Food is fresh, delicious, and has great kick to it. Didn't end up taking any pics because we had our two babies with us and were in somewhat of a rush to get them fed!  I definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes GOOD food"}
{"text":"Yummy! Good burrito place right in Tempe. Give this place a try. Will be coming back.  Got three burritos 1 barbacoa and 2 Carne Asada. All were very good and really filling.  If you live in Tempe and want a good burrito I recommend it"}
{"text":"SO Good!  Mango margaritas and enough variety in tasty Mexican food that I never tire of eating here.  Bring your friends - fun music and atmosphere that will transport you (almost) to a beach in Mexico!"}
{"text":"Cute little taco shop tucked a bit away from everything. It surprisingly still had a steady flow of traffic. We stopped in after hiking in the McDowells. I had the street tacos, and had 3 barbacoa beef, and 2 Carnitas pork. They were both very flavorful and the perfect little street taco. My husband had the meat quesadilla with asada beef. The beef was a little tough, but it was the good white cheese the taco stands in Mexico use. Very tasty. Not much ambiance, but I come to these places for the food anyway."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place when I was visiting Phoenix for a business trip. My intention was to find a Chipotle restaurant but I had found this place through Yelp. (There was a Chipotle a quarter mile down the road) I decided to stop in and give this restaurant a chance. Don't judge it by the outside of the building or the lack of parking. The inside was pretty cool to see the drawings and wrestling masks on the wall. The dining area is small but all the customers there are willing to share a table during their busy time. I had eaten there during lunch time on Saturday. A lot of customers are in and out of there getting food which shows you that this place is popular. I had ordered a standard burrito and also the rolled tacos with carne asada and everything on both. It was delicious and I did not have any complaints. If you are sensitive to spicy I suggest requesting the salsa on the side. Overall, I recommend this place. You should give it a shot if you haven't tried it. It's not better than Chipotle. It's similar but has different flavor. If I am back in Phoenix I'll stop by again."}
{"text":"Awesome big ass burros, worth for what you pay. Don't miss out, give this place a try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mucha Lucha is now Maskadores Taco Shop in Mesa Arizona. Not sure if that's the same for all the Mucha Lucha Restaurants. Their food is good. Their customer service is great. It's kind of like eating a at taco truck indoors. Not a lot of frills. Pretty low-key, and definitely one that should be discovered. They're very interested in earning your business. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Really good food and nice people.  Even though I only get the same item each time - vegetable burrito it is good each time and the staff is super friendly.  Definitely a hometown feel with great customer-oriented service.  The family is really nice and the mother owns the place."}
{"text":"This place is legit! Listen, I like Chipotle and this place has a Chipotle kind of feel to it. But this place is like Chipotle on mass amounts of illegal steroids.   To me the most  memorable part of this place is the homemade salsas that you can get on the side. There's like five different salsas in this little salsa bar area that you can add at your own convenience. I ordered a breakfast burrito and it was huge and so so good! I'm bummed that I don't live in AZ or I'd be at this place a lot! Give it a shot, I guarantee you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is a welcome addition to Fountain Hills.  The food was fantastic and everyone in the place has a big smile and happy demeanor! I highly recommend trying it out but beware all the sauces are a bit on the hot end of the spectrum. Excellent food overall I feel it's a little hard to find but worth looking for."}
{"text":"the best natchos in arizona at a decent price!!! the staff is friendly and it makes it that much better. mucha lucha taco is great!"}

If you're visiting or a local and want to try authentic Mexican food, this is the place! Everything is freshly made in house everyday, and you can taste it. Plus, it's locally owed and it's good to support the local economy. 10/10"}
{"text":"As a Latina, I have to say its soooo Mexican in there....glitter murals of Pancho Villa and Frida Kahlo paired with Jaguars and Mayan Temples -- and nothing by salsa musica on the overhead speaker.  I highly approve!    HUUUUGE burritos!...make sure to try the wet ones (enchilada style) --  the sauce is homemade and perfectly spicy.    The cooks are amazingly considerate...asking about your preferences and giving your recommendations.    Great Horchata as well!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the jalapeno cream cheese sauce.  1 star @ me for trying to be healthy and not ordering something with it.   I came here with friends and ordered some veggie tacos. They were great, with plenty of topping choices, but I immediately regretted not getting a hot, cheesy, fried dish topped with their jalapeno cream cheese. My friend got their rolled tacos and I was very envious.   Maskadores offers plenty of options and it's all pretty decently priced. Everything is fresh, the restaurant is pretty small with limited seating so beware if you come at a busy time. Overall, I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing quality.   Great price.   One of the best Mexican joints I've ever eaten at.   Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Definitely not the Real deal Lunchadores.. They use to be called something else (Muncha Lucha)  not sure how many times they have changed their name and take another hard working family business concept.. but the food was decent at either names but If you want the real deal Adores (made up name)- you gotta go to United Lunchadores."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I automatically was amused with the Lucha libre theme the restaurant has going  on. It's a nice atmosphere, clean and of course a line (which is always a good indicator that the food is good)   I started off with their street tacos with carne asada and man I was impressed. The corn tortilla was fresh and the meat was tasty. They were topped with cheese and of course I had to attack their salsa bar. Drenching my tacos in tons of lime juice and tomatillo salsa is a must.  Next I ordered the super nachos. Which they let you customize them in a way (like a chipotle) .. they were good, I have no complaints.. they have a variety of meats to choose from but I stuck with the carne asada. The chips are thin, crispy and fresh.   So to summarize my whole lunch experience I gave them a 5 star.. I was very happy with my food choices and there was a line but it moved fast (considering I went during lunch rush hour) the place is a little small but it's definitely family friendly. But what really set this place apart from other is they didn't charge me extra for guacamole. That blew my mind and I will be back:)"}
{"text":"So delicious and authentic! This corner needed a super taco shop!!! Please come! They are amazing!!! We had tacos, tostadas, and can hardly wait to go back to try other items!!! Fresh, delicious, great customer service!!! Encantada que estan aqui en mi vecindad!!! Blanca S."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. Staff was super nice and the food was phenomenal!!! I got the street tacos and it was a perfect amount of food!  I will defiantly be going back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Great mom and pop food was wonderful more food than I could've eaten in a week. Everything fresh made everything was wonderful. Deafly be back"}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious, friendly staff, clean. Great street tacos. You NEED To stop here!!"}
{"text":"New name and new owners.  visited 7-17-2017 Store seems not be be as clean as it used to be. Food is mediocre as well as service.  Any word where the old business moved to?  WOW!!  What an amazing little great find this place is.     I had the nachos with green chili meat.   The meat had virtually no grease and no fat and had a very nice nice spicy taste..mmmm. The vegetables were not only extremely fresh but were piled on high and the nachos chips were crisp and fresh. While I was enjoying this very tasty dish one of the very friendly staff members came up to my table and asked me how the food was.  I was quick to say AMAZING! Don't let the outside keep you away, the food and service was all very genuine and sure beats Chipotle hands down.  Definitely my new hotspot."}
{"text":"Tried this place out while on a business trip.  Even though it is in a strip mall I was pleasantly surprised with the amazing tacos.  Street tacos are delish."}
{"text":"Pretty spicy Mexican food. We ordered the tacos, a burrito and some meat quesadillas and two beers (22 oz). The total bill was about $40 and we all ate very but of our food. My wife and I agreed that our meat was a little too spicy- so we'll manage some heart burn later. My kids had the meat quesadillas and they ate that up. I really like the decor and music selections (Mexican), but a few things remind me that this is a newly opened establishment. Their wall menus could include more items and prices, and their restroom was missing paper towels.  Would I come back here again- Yes! Would I scream at friends to visit soon- nah."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! Great service and the food is always excellent."}
{"text":"Great street tacos.  Great seasoned food.  The place was clean,maintained, and staff was friendly.  My two upgrades would be cerveza and lengua tacos.  Great price point for the menu."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  The meats are extremely flavorful and the condiments fresh and full of pop.  I thoroughly enjoyed a carnitas bowl today.  The guacamole could use some more salt and spice, but otherwise, this place is a gem.  The extra hot green salsa (the thick one) is delicious."}
{"text":"Came here mostly because of the cool luchador theming and because I like tacos. I enjoyed the walls full of Mexican wrestlers, and the tacos were fine but nothing spectacular.  I went with the 5 street taco combo and I was hoping to try 5 different meats but was told I could only choose 2 which was fine. I went with one of the pork varieties and one of the chicken varieties I think (I can't quickly find their menu while typing this so I don't exactly remember). I got all 5 of them with the standard street taco toppings of onions and cilantro.  I got each of the sauces available to sample and a bunch of limes to squirt over the tacos, and most combinations of meat and sauces were pretty good, but again, nothing spectacular that I haven't already had back up in Connecticut. I guess I was just hoping for something next level down in Arizona?  While I was only slightly annoyed at only being able to choose 2 meats for my street tacos, I became more annoyed when someone in line after me asked the same worker I had if he could do 5 different meats for his street tacos and they went along with it.  So, while there was absolutely nothing wrong with the place, I can't say I'd go out of my way again to go there since the tacos weren't anything special and there's plenty of other options in the area to choose from."}
{"text":"Good food for a decent price.  The burritos are huge. Not too greasy either.  I have never been disappointed here and would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I went here for lunch and I was impressed! We each got three tacos. There was a line out the door but it was well worth it. Get a churro!!"}
{"text":"Was great place to eat... Cool interior with wrestlers mask on the wall ... I do wish the t.v was on. It had a nice 60 inch t.v in the wall with a black screen .. Not cool lol... Food was spicy and good ... Lady at counter needs to smile more but other then that it was a good place to dine."}
{"text":"The food was great. Line out the door but well worth the wait. Lots of FH residents socializing so it was easy to pass the time. They have a huge selection of meats and everything we tried was nothing short of amazing.   I had a burrito bowl with traditional carnitas, roasted corn, marinated red onions, pinto and black beans and all the fixings. Everything was AWESOME.   My guest had the two tostadas with carne asada and pinto beans. She loved her meal as well.   They have some of the old school Mexican sodas here and a nice salsa bar. There's a dark red salsa that is HOT HOT HOT (delicious but be careful)! The roasted jalapeños were an awesome addition to my plate. :)  All in all, I'm excited to see such a great restaurant not only on this side of town, but in Fountain Hills in general. Plenty of variety on the menu and they can expect many return visits from us so we can try it all!"}
{"text":"Sweet little ladies make you fresh, delicious, amazing tacos or bowls or burritos and you eat them in the super cool luchadores-themed shop or in your car on the way home, your choice. Highly recommended: three flour tacos with asada beef. Under $9 with tax with full toppings. Can't beat it. I'm in love, ok?"}
{"text":"Had such a great time here. They had great live music and good drinks. The wait staff is fast and polite"}
{"text":"This place makes the best fish tacos!!  We went last night and I'm still thinking about them!  They were perfect! Cooked perfect, right in front of me. Seasoned perfect. Dressed with the perfect amount of veggies!  I think we found our new go to taco shop. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I like my sauces on the side and it was no problema!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I went with my family and being the only vegetarian I was nervous but they have a vegetarian option (potatoes, onions, and vegetables)! It was delicious and all of us were happy with our choices!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this family owned business and it was truly a pleasant surprise. The tacos taste just like the ones we had in Mexico."}
{"text":"The food was good. But, their menu was very restricted. I just wanted one taco and I had to buy five. Not very customer friendly."}
{"text":"The food was good. The staff was friendly and prices reasonable. It appeared that they prepared shrimp alongside other meats on the grill, which does concern me. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome owner! Let us sample some meats. We got the street tacos and nachos. Very tasty! Will keep this in mind."}
{"text":"Taco heaven! There was quite the line and I can see why! Tacos were everything I hope for. Very authentic and delicious! Offer all the best salsas/hot sauces/guac. Staff is friendly and line moves fast. This will be a for sure stop every time I'm in AZ! Yum!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Street tacos  - 3 meat choices - barbacoa, chicken and pork. Barbacoa was the best but they were all good. My wife, who likes to stick to chain restaurants was impressed. The quesadilla was good but the street tacos were incredible."}
{"text":"I've been going to the location in Tempe (off-Broadway) so it was nice to see them open up another location 'in my neighborhood'. The storefront is a lot bigger and the best thing is they have alcohol!!! The layout of the menu is the same as you place your request and its made to order with all the fixings, then you pay and have a seat.   This time around we got a mix of meat for the 5 street tacos ($7.75) with the Super Nachos ($9.49)... We were expecting a lot more cheese so it seemed a bit bare but a lot of other ingredients were added so it looked good but didn't really have that over the top taste to match the price. Had to add guacamole ($1.45) and I got a top-shelf margarita ($9.50). They need to have a fixed drink menu available as you only see bottles behind the counter and screen monitor moves a bit to fast to really gauge your options. Oh, and regular size fountain drinks are $2. Be careful as you can quickly drop some coin and have a pretty expensive bill for some tacos & chips!!  Salsa bar had mostly hot (spicy) related items and didn't have a mild red style salsa that night. The decor is cool and the open space is definitely a plus.   Planning to come back and hoping the next experience will be better as our food didn't really meet our expectations this time around. It's good food but doesn't really separate itself from the field with mind blowing flavors."}
{"text":"18 photos... 10 regular types of meat, & 6 signature types of meat for $2 more  Despite having to wait in an extremely long line to get dinner (and slow) I have to say that it was definitely worth the wait. Looking forward to coming back as I ordered five taco plate. The restaurant is not so big so a lot of people get their orders to go but if you are able to get a table sit down, grab some salsa and other condiments from the minibar and get a Mexican style soda out of the fridge versus the fountain.   I arrived with only about 40 minutes left and apparently I caught the rush at the end of the night so I thought everything was a little bit rushed, however, it was still good. The one thing I was missing was some chips to go along with my tacos but you can get just about anything from onion cilantro cheese pico de gallo and more placed on your taco just try not to go overboard angel not get a chance to enjoy the meet.  The decor is suiting to all things Tempe, which I luv, as they have murals painted on the wall of fighters celebrating the spirit of the fighter. Next trip I'm planning to try the Nachos and burro as they looked pretty good!"}
{"text":"Amazing carne asada burrito with pinto beans & even better carne asada quesadilla with black beans! We will definitely be going back, I can't wait to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Mucha Lucha Taco Shop. I had the 5 street taco combo. It was absolutely fantastic. The carne asada was tender and flavorful, not tough or chewy like other fast food Mexican restaurants. The service was fast and friendly. I'm so glad this taco shop is close enough to my office to grab a quick, delicious lunch."}
{"text":"Tried  this taco place yesterday for lunch.  Just average nothing  special.  Tacos were small and  definitely wasn't worth the money. Wife ordered the Carnitas burrito and asked for rice no beans so instead of giving double rice she was giving 1 spoon of rice.  The burrito was small.  Just shy of $20.00 for both. The flavor was average actually I couldn't taste the Carnitas. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome strip mall taco shop. Feels kind of fancy with a cool glitter lucha libre mural. Street food kicked up many notches, flavorful meats, fresh veggies, excellent hot sauces, and strong margaritas."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in Fountain Hills. The street tacos are so good. Actually everything we have ate here is great. They make everything fresh and you can say what you want on it. The owners are caring and want you to be happy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The Burrito bowl is amazinggg, along with their street tacos. I honestly think of this place every Tuesday Lol - the only thing I'd complain about it's the smallish space/seating area, and lighting (too dark inside)"}
{"text":"Tersoro escondido!  Sombrero's Mexican Grill is simply a delicious hole in the wall hidden gem! I had the spicy tacos and frijoles and chips.   AMAZEBALLS!"}
{"text":"After seeing this taco shop pop up on Yelp time and time again, I decided to stop in and try some taco's. I ordered 5 street tacos 3 carne asada and 2 carnitas, they were good. I will be back to get more street tacos and try their jalapeno sour cream sounds amazing!"}
{"text":"This was by far much tastier than anticipated!  I loved the asada beef street tacos.  The jalapeno cream cheese was outstanding.  My bf had the green Chile beef tacos and I can't wait to try it in a burrito.  I definitely recommend it.  Don't let the exterior.or surrounding area detur you... or maybe you should and leave more for us ;)  There is also a location on Val Vista (haven't been there yet)."}
{"text":"It's a family owned (mom, dad, son) shop that I really y prefer eating at vs. the corporate k-r-a-p! They cook everything right in front of you. The portions are large.  My husband says it has a taste that is reminiscent of Chip-otle, which he doesn't like. But I liked it. Only complaint was that the pinto beans were not fully cooked. I will definitely try it again...."}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of this place! I'd eat here every day if I could afford it.  Shrimp (Baja caught) burrito bowl is out of this world, and you choose desired toppings! Maria and her family are wonderful people who get to know their customers. Nice clean environment. You will feel comfortable eating in or just ordering \"to go.\" Lucky to have them in town!"}
{"text":"What a jem, tika chipotle chicken is excellent. So sad its so far out. Fountain Hills could become a destination with food this good."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Delicious, fresh, clean and authentic!   A new favorite!  Maria and her staff welcomed us in and we felt like we had been invited to dinner in their home.  Love it!  Definitely worth going a little out of your way!  Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"The flavors are delicious here, authentic chili verde and carne adavado. It's a service line, very casual. They were out of iced tea with no sign on the machine, (as well as grilled corn) which was a bummer. The orders have to be repeated a couple times with pointing, but all in all it is a great place to get some authentic mexican food while on the go. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We tried this last Saturday afternoon for a late lunch.  He had a Barbacoa bowl and I had three fish tacos.  We also shared an order of chips. It is setup like Chipotles, but one person follows your order all the way through which could slow down things if it was crowded.  The servers were friendly and helpful offering us tastes of the meat as a lot of their food is very spicy.  My husband liked his and said he'd have it again. I thought my fish tacos were great.  Beware the sauces however - all the sauces on the table pack heat!  Chips were ok - not bad not the best.  Would we go again?  Yes, for sure."}
{"text":"Jalapeno cream cheese, nuff said. Put that on any burrito and you will leave happier than you came"}
{"text":"The beer is good the food is tasty and the staff is excellent! I will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Want some of the best street tacos outside of Mexico and SoCal? You definitely have to try this place. This is a lunchtime regular for my coworkers and I and we always leave happy and full. The only downside is the size of the interior dining but even that is worth the trip to eat here! Favs: red chili beef and carve asada with the hot salsa."}
{"text":"Pretty legit local taco shop... that happens to be a chain. Which makes it a bit unique. Oh, and it's uber small, so definitely don't try to bring a large group here... or really any more than 2-3 people. It would be nice if they could set a few outside tables on the outside. During dinner, the line can get a little long. Worth the wait though, they take care of you at Maskadores.    Get a plate of their 5 tacos and pay the upcharge to get a variety of meats. Forewarning, they are a bit spicy, especially combined with their least-spiciest salsa (applied before your plate is handed to you). I was a little disappointed at how spicy it was altogether, but thus is life in the Southwest. I liked the carne asada though. Worth coming back to spend another $10 and try another round of tacos without all the heat."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome food and love the heat! I love spicy food and they know how to make it hot!! Gotta get the green sauce!! It's pretty delish! Well worth the visit! I sure will be back!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food but had some bad experience twice with them. One time I got sick from their shrimp burrito the second time they messed up my order. But overall good and affordable."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new taco place and read good reviews about this place. They were all true!! Tacos to die for!!"}
{"text":"Great taco shop! Great flavors! The food is fresh. The salsa is hot. I've had the carnitas and the barbacoa flour tacos. Both were very good. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"If you think that all the food in Fountain Hills is bland and boring, then you haven't been to Maskadores! We stopped in tonight on the recommendation of a friend and we were not disappointed. Unbeknownst to us, it was five minutes before closing (I hate to be that guy!) but the owners were so nice and didn't seem bothered at all. I had the shrimp tacodillas recommended by the owner and WOW were they spicy and delicious!! This place is definitely on my list of new favorites. Get yourself in there!"}
{"text":"First off the street tacos are sooo good! Their carne asada is tasty and they have told me its a super secret marinade. Be sure to get the purple onions.  The place is family owned and everyone is kind and helpful. Thumbs up! The location is deceiving by the looks of the strip mall....do not be fooled its 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Lots of choices for meats and toppings. Some very spicy, they do inform you of the very spicy ones. This was my first time here. I'm coming back very soon, maybe later today!"}
{"text":"This place is as AUTHENTIC as it gets in this neck of the desert!  If you can't handle spicy, be sure to let them know & they will hook you up a gringo special!  Their green salsa is thee best, but definitely high on the spice meter!! The staff is friendly & most are related.  They will make you feel right at home.  The set up is similar to Chipotle, but this food is the real deal!!   They also have a large variety of cold beers!! Yummy horchata for the sweet tooth in your group.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I always get the 5 street tacos and they are always plenty of food and lots of flavor. I recommend the red chile chicken and pork and the Tinga chicken and pork. Both have a little spice to them. Love that you pick what goes on top ( cilantro, cheese, sour cream, onion, pico, etc) and the salsa bar is fabulous. I like to also order chips and guac. Good prices. Always leave full. Wonderful service. We bring our families here when they visit."}
{"text":"A fast food / gourmet Mexican Restaraunt. This is no bertos joint. This place is legit. They will make your dish exactly the way you want it. I could go here every day for lunch. I brought my gf"}
{"text":"The place looks rough but don't judge the book by the cover. The food is delicious. They have a build your burrito with several meat and tortilla choices. I had the carnitas rojo in my burrito, which was great. The salsa picoso has a kick. The horchata tastes like a vanilla shake."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican. Inexpensive, clean and professional. I've been here a few times and everything I've had is good. Spicy salsa!"}
{"text":"We were leaving the Angel's Tempe Diablo Stadium and craving some authentic Mexican food. Took a chance with this spot because although it had great ratings on Yelp, there weren't a ton of reviews. Sooooo glad we did!! The food was amazingly delicious and exactly what we were looking for! It's kind of Chipotle style in that they make your food in front of you and ask you what toppings you want as you go down the line. We got carne asada nachos with the works (including guacamole and the jalapeno cream cheese which costs extra but is definitely worth it) and a chicken taco and a regular pork taco. All were fantastic! We'll definitely be coming back to visit when we're back for Spring Training next year!"}
{"text":"F**K Chipolte.. This is the spot! I started with the Carne Asada street tacos and the hit the spot forreal real! Don't wast money at Chipotle, Mr.Matches told ya that!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic street tacos.. This is your spot! As first timers, we weren't quite sure what to order but the ladies behind the counter were great about offering up samples.   I tried my first horchata - wow! It's very sweet but tastes similar to vanilla almond milk.   My fiancé and his brother had 2 orders of tacos (they ate about 10 each!) so that they could try out all the different meats. The tacos aren't terribly big so if you're starving you'll probably want to order quite a few.   I had the barbacoa beef burrito bowl.. Yum yum yum! The beef was very juicy and melted in my mouth. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Once I walked inside, I loved it. Small little shop with painted pictures of fighters with glittery masks on. You walk up to the front and order, then customize your toppings. There's a salsa bar off to the side with some kick ass salsas (omg one of them is literally fire so watch out).   I am used to ordering tacos a la carte, but this place makes you order 5 at a time. Didn't think I would finish them all, but I did feeling content. These street tacos are SMALL. But at least they are tasty. I ordered the carne asada and fried fish tacos. The fish was alright; the chipotle mayo sauce made it way better.   Not bad on the first go, I just wish I didn't have to order 5 at a time. I wish I could have ordered one of everything instead of bundle packages. Pricing was fair. Oh well, I'll be back to try something new!   Environment: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I would compare this place to chipotle style. This place offers more than chipotle though. Four of us went here. None of us had any complaints. I got the street toco's with green chile beef, amazing! I would totally come back here. In fact maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden jem! Very friendly staff and great food. I hope they continue to do well and expand. The kitchen and restaurant are very small so I try to eat before noon to avoid a line. I'd recommend a chicken burrito, they're beef could be better."}
{"text":"If you want really good authentic Mexican food come here! The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is clean. We have tried the tacos, burritos and nachos and all have been amazing! I recommend Maskadores to everyone!"}
{"text":"Really tasty tacos, with a great selection of salsas. The place was more \"fast food\" of an atmosphere than I was expecting. The price seemed like a good value (5 tacos for$7), but the meal was not very filling which kind of ruined it for me. I felt like it should have come with chips or beans or something. The portion was my only complaint."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service and great food! Fresh every time we go and Maria always makes you feel welcomed. Great variety on the menu, beer and margaritas and an extra bonus is the awesome churros!"}
{"text":"I was getting my car fixed at The Car Shop across the street and walked over for lunch.  The sign above the building calls the place Taqueros and it was not until I walked up that I saw it was called Sombrero's Mexican Grill.  The place is colorful and clean and the women that work there (the owners?) are really nice.  Originally I was struck by the way they seemed to rip off Chipotle's business model and Somburros name but the lack of originality does not even matter.  They run a clean operation!   My husband loves chipotle and I hate it (because my burrito always ends up being ice cold) preferring the greasier -burtos joints.  Sombrero's is our happy median.  I can get a wheat tortilla, pinto beans that are actually vegetarian (unlike Chipotle's pork laden beans), deliciously spicy green sauce and free chips.  It is a really good value and if you frequent chipotle I would encourage you to make the switch to Sombrero's and support local business!"}
{"text":"We tried this place out just a few days ago. The food was fresh and flavorful, and the service was very friendly. It definitely gives Chipotle a run for its money (and I am a big fan of Chipotle).  I got the asada burrito, which also comes with a handful of chips. The man working behind the counter gave me some jalapeno cream cheese on the side, which tasted so good I ordered an extra bag of chips and cream cheese to take home with me.  My boyfriend got the tostadas. He's a huge fan of Mexican food and thinks this place is pretty great.  We also got some horchata, which was delicious. At first I thought it tasted a little watered down, but after a few more sips the cinnamon-y goodness really came through.   If you're in the area, I highly suggest Sombrero's."}
{"text":"Great amount of variety that all looked great. I ordered the sopes and they were great. The green chili chicken was spicy but had so much yummy flavor. The red chicken was good, and the traditional carnitas was good as well but the green chili chicken was the best out of the three.  Service was friendly and fast The place is pretty small but has a really fun atmosphere.  Would defiantly be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Food price was decent portions weren't great for the price but overall 4 stars for me it was solid I would go back and I would refer to a friend."}
{"text":"WOW!  This place is tiny and and so good.  I had the 5 street tacos and buddy had the chimichanga... both excellent choices.  Water beware the chimi is huge.  The salsa is excellent with a good kick.  We went at noon and the line was too the door.  Everything is made to order, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today and it was super impressive. The ordering is chipotle style. They build your plate in front of you and you can choose spice level and toppings. I had super nachos and my husband had the wet burrito, which was enormous.  Every component was fresh and cooked by someone who really knows what they're doing. Sooooo delicious. Will definitely return when I get the chance. Do not pass up this gem."}
{"text":"The hype here is not real, but its not bad. Whenever I visit a place in the Tempe/Phx area receiving loads of rave reviews, I come in with reserved expectations because this area loves bland food. And that's what the barbacoa and tinga are, soaking wet, watery meats lacking the oils and proper levels of cooked-in spice. The chicken texture was very dry. The carne asada is just alright, better flavors there from spice, but im never a fan of well done beef.   Packaged tortillas are just lazily thrown on the grill for a few seconds to warm up and not even flavored, or seasoned, or given a light browning or crisping for texture. The just serve as a soggy vehicle for your taco meats.   The salsa bar is the star, the green tomatillo sauce brings you serious heat that creeps on you at the end. The chunky smoked jalapeno \"relish\" is also a delicious spicy topping.   Service is friendly and they do a great job of moving quickly thru a large group of people.   Again, these are not bad tacos. But they are definitely not 5-star, \"OMG so Authentic!\" tacos. Tacos are serious business to me and they do not come close to the effort and attention that La Merced, Sahuaro, or Tepehuaje put into the tacos they provide."}
{"text":"We're so happy this place came to Fountain Hills! Eat in or carry out. Order from a wall menu, and they will prepare your choice exactly as you like it. Rich, traditional flavors."}
{"text":"We got takeout from here and were very impressed. I had a carne asada burrito bowl (yum, especially the guac), my husband had a burrito (which he loved) and the kids had a quesadilla (huge, they could have split one order). The chips were the best ever, made fresh! I very much recommend this spot and will be returning often."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. Today was my third visit here. I love the variety of meats, toppings, and salsas. Their pickled jalapeños are my weakness. Today I had the 5 street tacos that were fully loaded; I am now at home under the covers about to have the best nap of my life, lol."}
{"text":"Terrible experience... Whole in the wall, staff is stingy and has a bad attitude. They don't appreciate their gift comma they did not appreciate my choice in their place of business at all. They messed up my order and had an attitude about giving me a refund. I will never go there again"}
{"text":"Amazing! Three tacos. Barbacoa beef, red chili chicken and Carne Asada. I've never had Mexican food this good. Be careful of the Green Chili Chicken. It brings tears to your eyes."}
{"text":"The food was terrific!  Great flavors & wonderful sauces. Be ready for some spice & heat!! Had the burrito bowl with Barbados & green ch pork.  No liquor license yet and they need to upgrade the A/C.  Was very hot inside."}
{"text":"The chicken street tacos are super fresh and delicious! The decor in the restaurant is absolutely cool with huge wall murals. The owners are wonderfully friendly. This is probably the freshest food in town!"}
{"text":"My veggie burrito bowl w/guacamole was really delicious. Very fresh ingredients, tasty black and pinto beans & thin crispy chips. The margarita was quite good too! Not too sweet and served on the rocks. Hubby had grilled fish tacos that he said were very good. Lovely, friendly woman taking our order. Nice and clean. We will probably have lunch there again tomorrow."}
{"text":"First stop with wife and son for take away: WOO HOO! Fresh, tasty and for me, hot hot hot! Love it! We'll be back and back again."}
{"text":"The food tastes authentic! Tried the 3 flour tacos it truly tasted like a home cooked meal! Great joint!"}
{"text":"Holy sh@t! This place is BOMB! In town for baseball and was craving tacos! Found this spot on Yelp and was not too far from my hotel. Rolled up, located in a small strip mall the place is tiny, but the food is BIG on flavor! Really I could have eaten there each day I was in town. Awesome place, cool staff. Would definitely recommend and repeat!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food in a fun space decorated with a nationally enjoyed sport.  The food is as fresh as one could want.  Each item on their menu is hand made and served to your tastes.  Taco Tuesday is perfect with many choices for soft & hard shells and street taco versions.  The staff is friendly and hard working to assure you needs are met.  The location can be challenging to find, as the street signs are a bit faded.   It's behind the businesses located closest to the cross streets.    Well worth the extra challenge to find it."}
{"text":"I'm in love! This place is so freaking delicious! Got the veggie burrito with a chipotle tortilla, yum! Their hot salsa is very spicy. The burritos are huge so I would recommend splitting one. Fair prices. Two thumbs way up."}
{"text":"I can't go five because I'm just not that kind of guy, but this place was great. I got the street tacos with carne asada and barbacoa. My dad got the super nachos with red chili chicken. We thoroughly enjoyed our protein choices. They have a salsa bar with medium and mild choices and a two green jalapeño sauces that were amazing, in small quantities. The best part is that it is assembled right in front of you. 4.5 if it were possible."}
{"text":"Love this little spot! The staff are fast and the tacos are awesome.. haven't had a lot of the other menu items since i'm stuck on the tacos lol. Great find and in my neighborhood, I enjoy coming here for my taco Tuesday fix!"}
{"text":"Yum. I do love this shop it's close to home very affordable and delicious. Great customer service as well!!!!! Always friendly quick and helpful."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in this area. I've been going here for over a year since I work near by. I've tried other places and none can match them for flavor and freshness. Can't go wrong ordering anything from here. It might feel pricey but believe me nothing else in the area comes close in terms of consistent quality.  I usually get the taco salad or nachos and it hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"Excellent. Marvelous. Amazing. These are all words that I would use to describe the food and service here. So far, I have had a carne asada taco salad and the quesadilla. Both were delicious but I especially loved the taco salad. They cook the meat in front of you and there are a lot of toppings. The cheese, cilantro, corn, guacamole, and salsa was fresh and delicious. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"My wife and I met some friends here.  I had the 3 flour tacos and everyone else had the 5 street tacos.  My wife and I also got the chips with the jalapeno cream cheese.  The food was very good.  We will definitely recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"Clean simple little place. Food tasted good had the red chicken, carne asada and rancheros soft tacos. You go in and order subway style...tell them what you want guac, Pico, sour cream etc... quick and easy. A few days later had the fried rolled tacos.  It's essentially rolled tiquitos with potatoes inside and then they add what ever protein and toppings on top. For me, it was just okay, but it was definitely filling...maybe with different protein toppingwould make it better"}
{"text":"Every Tuesday I look forward to coming out to Tempe bc I know I get to have an early nacho dinner! 9 times out of 10 the chips are fresh fried for my nachos which adds to the delicious melt of the cheese (fresh grated, no goopy \"cheese\")! I am a huge fan of their green chile. Very spicy but not so spicy that you miss all the other flavors. Staff is always friendly and the crowd is usually interesting to watch while eating alone (I'm sure they're watching me back...)  Food and service aside, you can't help but be entertained by a restaurant with a disco ball as a permanent fixture."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Been there twice and the food is amazing! The owner and staff are super helpful and friendly. Try it all!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are from Dallas/FW and we were trying to find a quick Mexican food spot before we headed to Tucson and this place was AMAZING! My husband got the street tacos and I got the bowl. Plenty of food and delicious. We're finishing up our AZ trip in Sedona and on our drive up we made sure to stop at this place again. Bring this place to Dallas/Fort Worth please!!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a couple of years now and it is Awesome!!  Really cute place with Amazingly delicious food!!  You tell them what you want and they put it together right in front of you..  Barbacoa is Best in the city!!  Highly recommend you give em a try!!  You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting AZ and wanted some really good Mexican Food.  Yelpers delivered with this one.  There were so many places with good reviews that it was very time consuming trying to choose.  I wanted some place for dinner, so I needed it to be open past 4.  This shop kept coming up in my review search and it was less that 2 miles from my hotel so I gave it a go.  I had a wet chicken burrito and my husband had the street tacos.  I didn't try his because once I tasted my burrito I couldn't stop eating it.  The red sauce is spicy, but in a great way.  If I lived here I would gain 15lbs easily by eating here regularly.  If you are a tourist looking through reviews on where to go...go here you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great local tacos if you want get real food!"}
{"text":"A Hidden Gem in Fountain Hills! Clean and cool. My voice like that they have Nacho Libre masks on the walls! excellent carnitas!"}
{"text":"Was in Arizona with my dad for spring training decided to Roy this place out glad we did amazing food great setting in Arizona I had nachos loved them with the spicy pork or carnitas and my dad had tacos with beef and he loved them amazing restraint can't wait to go back in march"}
{"text":"Was happy to see that MLTS opened a store in Mesa.  I've tried the Tempe store a couple times and the food is legit.   Today I had the 3 Baja shrimp tacos and they were delish.  This place is going to do well, and is a must-try."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing.  I absolutely love all the different flavor combinations and choices.  It's always clean and the service is on point.  The Jalapeno cream cheese is to die for.  I have had pretty much everything on the menu and there hasn't been a thing I don't like.  I could eat here every day,"}
{"text":"Great, Chipotle-style restaurant. The food is consistently good, and the workers are friendly. Unfortunately, due to its popularity, there is often a long wait to order and not much available seating. Overall, I would still recommend, though."}
{"text":"Great Build-Your-Own burrito/taco/tostada joint. Just went there for the first time, Everything tasted fresh, rice and beans weren't overcooked! I plan on going back to see if my opinion changes. I had a red chile carnita burrito with everything on it, my friend had the carne asada tostadas."}
{"text":"Great food, fresh and tasty.  Friendly service and very accommodating  Will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Maricopa County! Love coming here. The staff and prices are amazing. You should check this place out."}
{"text":"Had some time in between an event.  Went here on Saturday 9/9/2017  Place was pretty empty.    Strip mall is kind of shady.  A drive thru liquor with some local drinks hanging out.  But still went in.  No problemo.    Had two orders of tacos and the macho fries.    Tortillas were super soft and Tacos were great.  All the toppings were awesome.    The macho fries with carne asada were pretty tasty.  Fries were seasoned and crispy.  All he toppings were awesome.  Just enough food to hold us over til our event.  And we shared it between 5 people.    Minus one star because she didn't put guacamole on out macho fries.  We realized it half way through and didn't bother to go back.    The picture clearly had guacamole on them. So it's a must unless you ask and I specifically say no guac!  Overall good.  Would go back or try their other spots...  Or maybe even hit this spot again but go through the drive thru liquor and pick up a Modelo Tamarindo Chelada!!!!"}
{"text":"So good. Came here for dinner and this little place came through with the flavor. We ordered the burrito bowl and the street tacos. Soooooo good."}
{"text":"6 stars for this place! The food was amazing, street tacos of all kinds. We were starved by the time we got here and the staff, tres Bonita's ( Maria, Monica and Jennifer) made us the most delicious taco we have ever had. We will be back for breakfast or lunch tomorrow!! This is a must visit place if you desire amazing food and great people."}
{"text":"Great food with friendly people. Price is about on par with one of the 'Bertos but the quality is better all around. Get the cucumber sauce on the bar!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. Everything I have had here has been fantastic. The quality of the food is great. The lines can get long but it is worth it. They also let you sample the meats which is nice."}
{"text":"Possibly, the best tasting, unbelievably delicious Mexican food in Phoenix. Flavors so clear and pronounced and some of the most incredible combinations you can find: sauce+condiments + fresh ingredients . Wow !"}
{"text":"My wife and I really like this place. I'd recommend trying out a variety of their meats with five street tacos. One warning: The red sauce and green sauce meats are SPICY. Like a 7/10 on the burn your tongue off scale. Very good, just spicier than we were expecting. :)"}
{"text":"Food is fresh, original, high quality , authentic and elevated beyond what you expect. Tortillas are handmade. Texture and flavor is perfect."}
{"text":"Came in here when I landed in town and it was delicious. The food is fresh, authentic, and delicious. The burritos are huge and the taco salad is fresh and filling. We weren't even able to finish our burritos they were so large. The meat was tender, juicy, and spiced to perfection. The sauces had that great balance of heat and spice so you could really enjoy the flavor while you got a tingle of heat circling your lips.   The gals there who prepared our food were so sweet and very nice. It was an overall pleasant experience and I would recommend to anyone who is looking for some dank Mexican eats!"}
{"text":"Totally worth a stop in if your craving some legit tacos. Also a plus if you like glitter and Mexican wrestling masks."}
{"text":"I love their food! I am just a little disappointed with the grill fish upcharge of $2.00 and you only get ONE piece of fish. If you were to go to a restaurant serving tilapia fish for $10.75 you would get at least two pieces again their food is really good but for $10.75 I will go elsewhere for grilled fish. Would have been five star but the price killed me *sigh*"}
{"text":"This is a go to taco shop. Stopped in for a Saturday lunch and am glad that I finally stopped in. The night before we drove all the way to Gilbert to try a certain taco shop but won't do that again because this is the best taco shop I've been to in a long time.   Atmosphere - Small, but comfortable. Great music. Walk up to order.  Service - You order your food first and are helped by the line. Everyone was friendly.  Food - The star. You order your meat/chicken and then how you want it. On the line you can customize your tacos or burrito or bowl. The key is the tortillas, and the corn and flour tortillas they use are great. Street tacos - Mixed the meats and all were great. You get to customize your tacos. Chorizo Breakfast Burrito - They use a fried egg and the chorizo is diced. Not too spicy but lots of flavor. A visit to the salsa bar offers a lot of options, some with some good heat. Lot's of beer options in the bottle or draft, and the draft is at least 22oz.   Sometime you want tacos and you look for places to go to, but this is a place that you go to because it makes you want to have tacos. Excellent!!!!!"}
{"text":"After 5 yrs still my Favorite Taco shop to go. Love the idea of late hours during the week."}
{"text":"I finally found this place, thanks to helpful description from my fellow Yelpers!  It's in the strip mall near Subway and Pizza Hut.  I got 2 carne asada burritos to go.  The burritos were very generously sized, but I wish the meat was more flavorful.  also I ordered a side of guac that I wasn't too impressed with in terms of flavor.  I like that they have a salsa bar, although I wish they'd label their salsas with mild, medium, hot.  I'm not a wimp in terms of spice by any means, but every salsa I tried ended up being too hot!  I'd definitely come here again, but it's not my favorite joint to grab burritos."}
{"text":"Best taco shop in the area!!! Their shrimp burrito is delicious and fresh- they grill the shrimp to order right in front of you. I'm also a fan of all off their marinated chicken mmm mmm! If you are looking for an authentic taco shop, this is your spot. They offer you samples if you're unsure of what to order and they have lots of homemade spicy salsas. So happy they are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The burritos are delicious and very authentic-the owner often works there and will talk with you about how all the food is prepared while allowing you to sample the different ingredients. Very friendly"}
{"text":"Real authentic Mexican food made in front of you. Street tacos  and the chimichangas are on point. Would go again."}
{"text":"\"They give me no eagle powers! They give me no nutrients.\" ? Nacho Libre  Dang, I felt like I got both eagle powers and nutrients after eating at Maskadores Taco Shop!  I was not expecting to eat so much delicious eats but I did and I'm happy.  We had a Chimichanga, Five Street Tacos, and an order of Super Nachos.  I also washed all this down with a ginormous and tasty Michelada.  It was an intense dinner and at less than $40.  I was happy.  The flavors are bold and the meat is so dang juicy.  They grill it on the flat top right behind the bar so everything comes out fresh and hot.  We tried an assortment of meats from green chile beef to red carnitas pork and asada ranchero.  It was all good!  Even the basic beef barbacoa was delicious.  The Michelada looked and tasted amazing.  It was near closing time and I thought it was going to be a small modest serving but it was a huge mug of awesomeness.  I could only finish half before giving up.  I tried guys.  I really did.  :(  I was just full off of lots of food.  Don't forget to check out the salsa bar.  By far this was one of the tastiest and spiciest salsa bars in Arizona.  Maskadores Taco Shop is clean and nicely decorated.  The price point is a bit higher than the competitors in the area but the succulent meat makes it worth it for me.  I will definitely stop by again.  \"I know it is fun to wrestle. A nice pile-drive to the face; or a punch to the face; but you cannot do it because it is in the Bible not to wrestle your neighbor.\"  ? Nacho Libre"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've ever tasted! And I LOVE Mexican food. You can't go wrong with this place! Home run."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my tacos! I got the 5 tacos and chose a different meat for each one. Would definitely recommend. The service here is great too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it!! The service was great and the tacos were delicious. I recommend trying all the different salsas available!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. It wasn't life changing and it wasn't insane but it's definitely a place to come back to. I ordered a wet green chile beef burrito while my boyfriends ordered the street tacos with carne asada, chipotle chicken, tinga chicken. The carne asada and chipotle chicken was alright but the tinga was kinda plain and not that great. But the green chile was absolutely delicious. I would recommend that everyone gets this one because you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Kind of hit of miss depending on who you get to make your tacos. But if you get the right person - it's BANGIN'. I love the shrimp tacos and the battered and fried fish tacos. The green avocado salsa is a sleeper. Watch out for that spice!"}
{"text":"Authentic taco shop. Nothing fancy but tasty. Look out - the salsas are crazy hot. The green chile beef & red chili carnitas are too spicy for me but the tinga chicken is off the hook! Guacamole is too bland but cools down the spicy food."}
{"text":"Really authentic!  Like Chipotle, but much better!  Friendly atmosphere!  Lots of choices!"}
{"text":"My Cuban taste buds said \"Si\" to the Three Shrimp Taco plate for a late lunch to eat there. I returned that night and picked up \"To Go\" for my husband and me. That consisted of Chips with Jalapeño cream sauce- a new way for me anyways, to eat chips, if like me, you're looking for something different than salsa or guacamole dips. The jalapeño taste was balanced, not hot, not too mild. If you're having a party, one bag of chips is too small, get more, and add an order of salsa, guacamole, and jalapeño cream. They don't have quesadillas on the menu, so if that's your thing, have a plan B. There is a condiment cart with fresh home made sauces and lime wedges as you walk out. Mucha kucha is local, authentic, small, and the decor fits The nane, Extra coolness! Bilinguals don't be shy out of  ordering your food in Spanglish, English or Spanish. \"Comida a Toda Mecha!\"- Mari La Cubana"}
{"text":"Wow! I was really impressed by this place. I just needed semi-decent Mexican food in the area, and was surprised at how great the reviews were for this place, so I gave it a try (with a 7-person group).  Apparently it's crazy at lunch, and there isn't much seating inside--but we were there from 5:30 to 7 p.m. on a Thursday and it was pretty empty.  The staff are wonderful, and will do whatever to make sure you are customizing your meal to your preference. They offer samples of their different meats.  The guacamole was authentic, but not very flavorful (again, downside of being authentic)--everything else far made up for it. They have a salsa bar, and make your quesadilla/tacos/burrito/whatever you wish right in front of you, adding whichever ingredients you'd like as they go. I got a quesadilla with red chili chicken, which was flavorful and very delicious. The quesadillas are HUGE.  Very low prices.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and friendly, worth 5 stars and the price is great for what you get! They have something for every one. Beef, chicken, pork, and vegetarian."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only is the food fabulous, but the people who work there are so very sweet! My husband and I moved out here from Portland about 6 months ago, and they have made us feel very welcome! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at this place a lot when I lived closer. The build your own burritos are bomb! You can pretty much have anything you want in it."}
{"text":"Being picky about tacos limits my ability to truly enjoy myself when eating what I consider below-average tacos.  These are not those. These street tacos are so very tasty. I tried them for the first time last night and voila! My tastebuds were dancing and I was in a happy place.  Go here and let your tastebuds experience what I too have uncovered. (Really good street tacos - I had the tinga and carnitas. Both were excellent but I slightly preferred the carnitas)"}
{"text":"First time to any of their places. Wife and I went to this one on a weekend drive. So glad I stopped there. The place is simple and very xasual. Love the decor od mexican wrestling murals. Fun. Ordered at the counter and watched items cooked up while we waited and talked to the cook/waitress. Very friendly. I got the 4 street tacos with Chipotle chicken, beef and pork. Tacos topped with their homemade HOT taco sauce. Wife had a cheese quesadilla. Food was excellent. Fresh and so tasty. So glad I found this place and will be going to the one in our area."}
{"text":"Maskadores Taco Shop  Small hole in the wall restaurant, but a key find. Theme for the Mexican Masked Wrestlers, walls are painted and decorated with the maskadores all over the restaurant.  Ordered the Wet Burrito with Carna Asada, tortilla is very good, also had guacamole, rice and black beans inside. I had the sauce on the side because I did not want the burro to get soggy and I used the sauce to dip and pour on each bite which was delicious.  My son ordered the 5 Street Tacos, all Carna Asada, I stole one from him and it was very good.   Would recommend both dishes and would also come back to try other items.  Good prices and good quality authentic Mexican food.  Bueno"}
{"text":"Tempe strikes again!  Our little city is home to another excellent hole in the wall restaurant.  Many thanks to the staff at Sombrero's for making some extremely flavorful Mexican food complete with friendly service.    This was my first time at Sombrero's and I had a shrimp burrito and really enjoyed it.  The rice, chopped onions, cilantro, chipotle sauce, roasted corn and hot salsa made it a highly enjoyable lunch outing.  I also had the super nachos with carne asada.  Delicioso!!!  Sombrero's is a casual spot with 2 large TVs, to satisfy a sports fan's cravings on a weekend.  The high quality ingredients, variety of different meats and salsa bar make it an extremely worthy Mexican spot that can become a regular hangout for anyone that wants to try a variety of offerings.  I know I will be back and I will bring family and friends too.  **Tip 1**  Load up with not only salsa, but those pickled jalapenos and carrots at the salsa bar  **Tip 2**  They don't serve beer, so if you need to wash down your tasty Mexican comida with some beer, order the food to go....or have a few beers next door at Boulders on Broadway and then head over to Sombrero's!"}
{"text":"Second time there and it gets better every time.  First time I had the shrimp tacos, this time I had the chicken quesadilla and my GF had the nachos.  So full of flavor.  I can't wait for the next excuse to go back and enjoy this new place!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! They were in the top 3 taco places near Tempe Diablo Stadium by mlb.com's Alden Gonzalez and he was so right!! The meat is great some is really spicy and some is a bit milder but all is very good. The horchata is worth it if you like horchata.   The one thing that brings us back here every time we visit to watch baseball is the churros! They are amazing. Simply they are the best churros we've ever had. Every time they are perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside with a little bit of filling. The caramel they serve with it is a perfect compliment. They are pretty much worth our trip here whether our team wins or loses. Be careful of their hours. They are easy to visit on the weekdays but not open much on Saturday and Sunday."}
