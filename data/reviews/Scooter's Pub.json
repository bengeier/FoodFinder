{"text":"Paid 5 bucks to see UFC.  No room at bar.  Put at table in back.  1 waitress taking care of 13 tables.  Waited 20 min for her to take my drink order and she's not friendly.  Thats ok I will spend my money somewhere I'm appreciated.   DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE."}
{"text":"Great people and staff!  High energy and the food was pretty good too.  I highly recommend it if you're looking for a great atmosphere to watch sports and hang out."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a few drinks with friends  . I went yesterday and I had a great time I recommend this place to anyone in the area ."}
{"text":"Walked into the bar area to gamble and have a beer. There wasn't a bartender around, not a good start. Sat for approximately 20 minutes before the bartender showed up and took my beer order. I had one beer and she asked if I wanted the food menu. She gave me one, I played another $20 and never saw her again until I walked out."}
{"text":"Decent looking place on the inside but service is very slow. Nothing special. Nachos are okay. They may want to consider having more than bartender on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I support this place every year when I'm down in vegas for my yearly seminar. Love it, glad it's there, and glad they support the Seahawks!

Great food, great people, great time. Can't say enough about this place. 

Walk right in have a seat."}
{"text":"Might be the worst place I have ever been to. One of the bartenders there, looked to be in his thirties, had the worst service I've ever received. This place is very dirty and had horrible food. I would never recommend going here."}
{"text":"Went to see a football game ,was bumped into,stared at,and treated poorly,because i was not a Seahawks fan.....didnt know i wasn't welcome by the crappy fans and crappy service...now i know to never waste money here again"}
{"text":"Crappy crappy crappy, what can I say?  So much so called \"marinade\" on my pork chop, I couldn't tell you if I was eating pork, chicken, steak or havalina."}
{"text":"This bar is absolutely AMAZING for the Super Bowl Champion,  A.K.A. World Champion Seattle Seahawks fans. If you claim 12, and if you're around here ... get here. It's home. Go HAWKS!!!"}
{"text":"Service is great! Food amazing for a sports bar we got the Philly cheese steak and chicken fingers you get to huge ones there potato salad to was good."}
{"text":"I would give it 100 stars if I could!! I am a life long Washingtonian and Sea Hawks fan. 5 of us were in Vegas for a combination birthday trip and after a quick Google search we decided that Scooters would be the place to go watch the Hawks VRS.Falcons game. What a show! The Las Vegas Seahawkers club was top notch and VERY welcoming. Under the advice of a bartender that I spoke with a few days before the game we made sure to arrive a few hours early and we had the privilege of sitting by some of the club officers. What a GREAT group of people! If you are a Hawks fan and want the same type of high energy hawk madness you will find in Seattle this is the place to go.

Also $9 pitchers of beer and HUGE meals for under $10!!!! Beautiful servers who do incredibly well for the amount of people they have to tend to. The $25 dollar cab ride from Harrah's was well worth it.

Just one more testament to the type of people in the bar one brave soul came in wearing red pants and an Atlanta Falcons jersey. He was hazed but treated well and after the game and a big snafu with the cab service he offered and took the 5 of us to our hotel. Talk about  SPORTSMANSHIP!!!!

Great people, great food, great prices, just a great time!!!!


SEAHAWKS!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and was impressed. The service Is amazing, the bartender Girlie was very attentive and funny. Great staff with gorgeous bartenders.  The beer selection was great. They have pool, darts, shuffle board and some arcade games. The 46\" hdtv's at the bar are great. They have a beer club, if you drink all 69 beers in 6 months time, you get a free draft every time you come in for the remainder of the 6  months and you get a picture taken as well as a 69 T-shirt, so the faster u drink all 69, the longer u have for free beer.  Fun place, beers and cocktails are better priced than PT's when it's not happy hour. Had the angus sliders with a side of fries and was happy. The food is good and average priced. I will definitely come back here. I have 60 beers left to go. Also they show the UFC fights and there is no cover. Awesome place!!"}
{"text":"Had a Super experience... Went in for lunch to order to go for the office today 9/9... The bartender was fantastic, she took my order quickly.. I had a coupon that she told me couldn't be used for to go orders and I was screwed... But she is an out of the box thinker and said well we could order for here and bring to go boxes... Sounded fine to me... Played a game of pool while I was waiting.... and surprise she had it boxed up for me... I ordered the chicken parm sliders with tater tots.... yummy"}
{"text":"Scooter's is a great locals sports pub. The bartenders and wait staff are familiar with the regulars and friendly with everyone.  

If you're a Seahawk fan, this is the place to be during football season. For UFC fans, this place shows the fights for free, just show up early because it gets to standing room only fast and there is a small entry fee, but beats $350 a ticket.

The food is good here and there is a decent happy hour menu as well.

I would recommend this place to anyone looking to watch sports and hang out with friends. There is also a shuffle board, old school arcade games and Golden Tee."}
{"text":"We're not pub people since most of the time the food sucks at these kinds of places, (at least is been my experience) but I have to say that these guys got it down. My husband always orders the the blt chicken avocado wrap and it's amazing!!...."}
{"text":"So I came here on a Thursday night to check this place out after hearing about it from a friend who works here.  This review is strictly for the bar area as we did not come here for food.  The drinks were reasonably priced as a pitcher of Bud Light was $9 and Stoli was $5 so I can't complain.  They also have arcade games in the bar area which was kind of nostalgic, especially seeing Street Fighter 2 and Mortal Kombat.  They have some great specials when the Phillies are playing but I didn't ask why the Phillies, maybe the owner is from Philly?

I would have given Scooters 4 stars but we came here on karaoke night and the talent was mediocre at best.  See, the reason I don't do karaoke is because I know I can't carry a tune and would prefer not to torture the other patrons in the place.  I guess after a few drinks, all logic goes out the window and people will sing no matter how it sounds.  Anyways, I'd probably come back on a non-karaoke night..."}
{"text":"I was stranded in Vegas for a night. I booked a hotel which just happened to be next to this place. When I walked into this bar, I felt at home, being a Hawks fan. 
Good prices, nice atmosphere and great bartender. She was polite, friendly and nice to look at. She even was able to make a Brandy Manhattan for my father....
Might just have to come back here for Superbowl to watch the Hawks again.."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great food...my sister and I split a cajun burger which was delish!  Drink prices are good too.  The servers were great and it even had a decent pool table.  This is my favorite bar for UFC and Wranglers hockey."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this \"hockey bar\" during the NHL playoffs this evening. Found one-single TV in the back corner of the bar playing the game. Halfway through the second period the bartender \"Amanda\" changed the channel to UFC while we were the only ones watching that particular TV in the corner.  We asked her to change it back, and without apology she changed it back...along with an extremely rude comment. She then went back to the other end of the bar complaining to her other patrons how much she \"hated hockey fans.\"  Classy!

There are tons of other bars in Vegas that will serve you a cold beer without attitude...I suggest you skip this one. Unless you enjoy rude service (similar to \"Dick's Last Resort). Despite what they claim...Scooters is NOT a hockey bar!!  The bartenders at Hooters down the street were very nice and we were able to enjoy the 3rd period of our game...thanks Hooters!  

Shame on you Scooters for claiming to be a \"hockey bar\" and instead serving cold beer along with an obnoxious attitude by your star employee Amanda the Bartender!"}
{"text":"'Hawks and wings. Can get smokey, but the atmosphere is the best! Come early if you want a seat."}
{"text":"Best bar in the area HANDS DOWN. We're regulars here and usually come in late night on weekends but every now and then we'll stop in for an after work bite. I can honestly say there is not one bad thing on the menu and not one unpleasant employee. Everyone who works here is cool and always happy (customer service is always greatly appreciated whether you're in a bar or a 5 star restaurant). Big Eric is our favorite bartender here. He's always in a great mood and fun to be served by. I'll continue to recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Sports Bar. What else can I say. The bar area is huge with some gaming machines. This place gets crowded at times. The bartenders are cool and the vibe is friendly. 

I ordered the kobe dog. Footlong hot dog with all the trimmings. It was really really good. The chicken wings are also pretty good. I browsed through the menu and everything looks so appetizing. 

I like this place; 4 stars for food, service and fun."}
{"text":"Spent a wonderful afternoon  at scooters pub.. the food was perfect and the service spot on.. Sunnie the bartender  was friendly and attentive.. I highly recommend. .."}
{"text":"Seahawk Bar of Las Vegas!!!!!! Great place to visit when the Seahawks are playing. Met some new friends and definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"If you are from a place that does not allow smoking in public places then DO NOT GO HERE. Smells so smokey. It's gross. The food was so-so. Portion size is a plus. I went because you get a 15% discount if you are staying at the Holiday Inn Express next door. Wish I had gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"I started coming to scooters every Saturday because of the excellent service I received from crystal. I will continue to come every week and recommend scooters to any of my friends. Vanessa and Katie give great service as well. If you are looking for a great atmosphere and a regular place to go. Make sure you go the hours crystal is working."}
{"text":"Just came to town to visit a friend who just moved here- driving all around looking for a place (other than fast food) for dinner. Passed this place, saw lots of cars, so thought we'd check it out! What luck! Burgers, salads,pizza steak & more!Asked missy, our waitress, her favorites. She was friendly & not pushy or in a rush. I had the chicken & avocado salad & my 
Friend had the grilled ham & cheese with Curley fries. Sandwich & fries were nice & hot and fresh & very tasty salad. We arrived past the happy hour but I know my friend will be coming here often. Great prices & food. Very comfortable for a girl to be alone & wanting dinner & drink."}
{"text":"Stopped by to watch a UFC fight. There were 2 bouncers at the door; one politely informed me the place was full. As I was reaching for my phone to call my bf, the other bouncer - clearly drunk - says: \"But you're hot...if you're alone you can come in\". He moved on quickly and started having a conversation with one of the servers about some customers. They were rude and unprofessional. If you need to vent and talk s*** about customers, go to the kitchen or to a place where no one can hear you!"}
{"text":"I wish I had better things to say about Scooters. I went there with some friends to watch UFC196 and for watching a fight it's a decent environment. As others have said there's a $10 cover and you need to get there early to snag a table. The fight is shown on two big screens with accompanying audio.  Unfortunately it's everywhere else that Scooters falls short.  

The food in a word is bad.  I'm not sure how you screw up wings, burgers and pizza but Scooters did. The wings and burger were bland and over cooked.  The pizza ranks with one of the worst I've ever had.  I ordered sausage as a topping (expecting Italian sausage) and what came on the pizza was slices smoked sausage (think Eckrich smoked sausage). 

Lastly the service was lacking.  I know it was a big event, but Scooters shows fights all the time, they should be staffing appropriately for the crowd.  Getting drink and food orders took forever and the few staff present seemed frazzled.  

Please find a new line cook."}
{"text":"Awesome great food and awesome service thank you team tonight for having my first time here rock love it... Goooooo Hawks!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is sooooo good, and the waitress is THE BEST!!!!!  Lisa is always so awesome with my kids, and very attentive to what our table needs.  She is prompt and her recommendations are never off!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pub with amazing service and the best bartender in Vegas...Gretchen!!!  She can make you any drink you can dream up...a wonderful surprise!!!"}
{"text":"This tends to be a group happy hour spot with my coworkers, so I've become pseudo-regular.  Not to the point where \"everybody knows your name\" just yet, but it's becoming familiar.

Just good ol' sports bar fun.  The 2 bartenders I see when we go are both great.  Good service and friendly.  The waitress on our happy hour day is awesome.  

Pretty good bar food.  Cold beers in clean glasses.  Comps for gaming.  And a shuffle board table to top it all off.  Any games you can play without having to put your drink down rank high in my book o' fun!"}
{"text":"Awesome bar, food is good, love the happy hour prices during football season (game days). Wife and I went there 4 times and always had good food and good service. Can't complain, it's a Seahawks bar. The sports bar part is awesome and the sit down resturant part was good too. It just need more big screen tv. Overall, I will always go back to support Scooter's Pub and the Seahawks. Go Hawks!!"}
{"text":"Loving this place for Seahawks Games! Great drinks and Nikki the bartender is cool and attentive! The food is quality bar food and the prices are reasonable. So the NFL Season looks great on ample lcds and big  screens! So now.. Can the Seahawks win? I will be at scooters to see if they can!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sandwich on a late Monday afternoon and sat in the dining room. It just happened to be a seahawks viewing party. Strange lot. Anyway...following the server's suggestion I had the 'Philly Cheesesteak'. The best description would be a hot beef sandwich with steamed onions and peppers all it lacked was gravy. Way far from a Philly cheesesteak. The meat, although tasty, was too thick and in big slices that was soaking in some kind of au jus. The beer (Sam Adams Oktoberfest) was ice cold and the fries were hot and crisp. The service was beginning to slow as the wacked out fans started to arrive. But that was to be expected. My next trip will include nachos which I noticed was the most popular dish coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"So much fun for Hawks games, but it's too hot and smokey to even enjoy the game. Food is good but the smoke makes you not want to eat."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect from a sports bar, with a surprisingly delicious offering of food. Everything we've had was excellent. Wings, burgers, OMG the southwest egg rolls are HUGE! Drinks are cheap, bar tenders are friendly, the place is clean. It's our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Good eats, ample tvs and projectors, and nice beer selection. Unfortunately the liquor selection is small so if your looking to party with cocktails I'd pass. However is you love beer and sports this is definitely a bar to check out. I have always had a great time at Scooters and won't be shy of returning!"}
{"text":"Good food, decent beer options, horrible service. After being told happy hour was over, 5 minutes before it actually ended, it took 10 mins to get one beer and one house wine. We finally gave up on the waitress & transferred the tab to the bar. The bartender was good but blamed the bad service on the event organizer (in addition to Seahawks and UFC, this bar hosts all Univ. of Kentucky bball games). I wouldn't go back if my good friend wasn't a UK alum."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by when your hungry and have been out having to much fun yes I took a cab there it's close to my place. they serve open menu it's 24hours and drinks the bartender was very attentive and had great costumer service skills and ofcourse the cocktail servers where in full affect and looking good the venue is big a lot of space for a good party and plenty of TVs on the walls they have a great all night special buy 10wings get 10free I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Burger was surprisingly good for bar food. 
The cook did forget to put bacon on my burger. But before o even noticed he promptly brought me some. The bathrooms were also surprisingly clean for a bar. It was actually a big surprise.
Overall it is a nice little spot and I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Since this is THE place to be for Seahawks game night, we thought we'd try it out. Granted it was a Thursday night preseason game but, the place was packed. Unfortunately, they were not staffed for this! Two behind the bar and one sole waitress to tend to everyone else.

When we arrived, we ordered off the happy hour menu and it's a good thing we did. It took nearly 15 minutes for our pitcher of beer and glass of water to arrive and another 30 for the food. We were never asked if we wanted a regular menu and we didn't see our waitress until nearly half-time. At one point we were finally able to get the attention of one of the bar tenders who gave us a menu but by the time the waitress came to our table again, there were 7 minutes left in the 4th quarter.

What we did eat off the happy hour menu (nachos and potato skins) were ok. Most of the nachos had been burned, quite dark brown with not much for toppings. The potato skins were fresh but bland - both items were loaded with scallions, perhaps a bit much.

I'm willing to give the place one more try, for my hubby the Seahawks fan, but if service is as terrible or worse - never again."}
{"text":"After seeing the NO RESERVATIONS ACCEPTED on web site - we find out that reservations are the only way to watch the super bowl here and they were already full up 2 weeks before the game. So much for even trying this place. Hear the food is lousy & service bad anyway."}
{"text":"Pretty nice bar. I was in town for a little bit, and I wanted to watch the Kings-Ducks hockey game. A friend of mine that lives in Vegas suggested we go to Scooter's, and that we'd also get to watch the Las Vegas Wranglers game (Vegas' ECHL hockey team).

There were a buch of Wranglers fans there, wearing jerseys, watching the game. Man, Wranglers fans are pretty passionate about their team. That was cool to watch.

I didn't try any of the food here. We drank a beer and then headed out to another bar."}
{"text":"Bartender was the sweetest. She makes awesome bloody Mary's too.

I came in for breakfast and was blown away. The food was SO GOOD. And it's dirt cheap.

I had two pancakes, two strips of bacon, two pieces of sausage, two eggs, hash browns and biscuits with delicious gravy for $8.99!

I will definitely be back to try the rest of their menu and hang with my new buddy."}
{"text":"Ok, I gave Scooter's another shot and I think it's safe to say that I can retract most of the discrepancies that I listed from my previous review. Food remains decent if not slightly better. Great service. But just the crowds that literally P-I-S-S me off.

As said before, NOT management's fault for allowing such idiots into this pub. I'm always sitting around a bunch of morons who are only there to ignite their belligerence and wait for a highlight-reel knockout. But that doesn't happen every fight and because of that dread, these idiots insult and disrespect the event so publicly that it makes me want to make them the victim of their own desires. I'm so disgusted with that brawl till you fall attitude. And intoxication is never an excuse. Someone just needs to buy these idiots more drinks so that they can pass out and cuss at the toilet instead.

Otherwise, I won a free long sleeve UFC shirt last Saturday :D"}
{"text":"Great spot for any sports fan. So many televisions and if you are a Seahawks fan then this is the spot! This place is the official bar of the Las Vegas Seahawkers and every game is like being at home(in the NW). Food is great, service is great and everyone is always super nice."}
{"text":"First and most likely last time here. In Vegas on a business trip, staying at Holiday Inn. Saw the restaurant across from the hotel and decided to have dinner there since it was a walking distance. Walking in around 4:45, nobody there. Just one guy at the bar, 1 bartender-hostess-waitress and another guy in the diner section. Waited 5 minutes to be seated.. Ordered chips and salsa for appetizer... Had only two dips of it. The nastiest salsa I ever had! Pretty much canned chunky tomatoes mixed with chopped onions and greens. Guacamole - spicy as hell! It's NOT supposed to be spicy cook gurus! Then ordered one of the sandwiches... Dried bread, chewy bacon and tons of turkey. In other words I'm happy to have brought snacks with me to munch on them later. Even if I come back to the same hotel, I won't be eating here. Oh yeah and they don't take AMEX :) Just lovely."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel next to this place. Had really good food and great, personable staff. I recommend the Cajun Penne dish. It was huge and delicious. 
Also tried the chicken avocado salad, that had a vinaigrette dressing that was very different. it was awesome. Also, 2 pool tables."}
{"text":"I was impressed with this bar. Service was good and fast. I told the girl I wanted a burger an it came about 15 mins later cooked perfectly and was delicious. Good prices on beers aswell , and they have a couple varieties on tap. Also their gaming is solid , have some types of poker I haven't seen before."}
{"text":"Came here because I was looking for a hockey bar and some of the reviews said this was the place to go. Um, no. That wasn't the case. I would have asked if she could turn one on, but after she gave me my first beer when I arrived I was pretty much ignored and the place was dead. They had a lot of TVs showing the same 2 college football games. Pretty standard otherwise. No different than a PTs or Lodge.  Couldn't say how the food was. Didn't stick around. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Probably one the cleanest local bars I have ever been to!

Met up with some friends here the other night.  They have a ton of beers, and you can join a beer club (FREE!) and if you drink all the beers on there in like a 3 month period, you get draft beers for free for the next 6 months?  Or something like that.  It gets you out of your comfort zone of normal beers (Bud light anyone?) and gets you to try stuff you probably wouldn't.

Food is better than normal bars.  I had the nachos.  Good and there was a massive amount!  My husband had the pulled pork sandwich with onion rings, which he said was fine and our friends loved the mac & cheese.

The bartenders are great and very attentive.  I put in $20 into a machine (which I usually don't do) and of course all of my 3 beers were free.

They have TVs everywhere and pool tables.  OH- The bathroom was really clean!

I will definitely be heading back!"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed and unimpressed. We came here because of a college basketball game and their happy hour specials. The beer offerings are meh. The wings were not good at all - not good quality meat, non-spicy sauce, not saucy enough, and not good dipping sauce. Nothing else we tried was worth writing home about either. And the service was incredibly slow and scattered.

But the ambiance and vibe are nice. It's a bit divey. It's homey. It's welcoming. It's got cool, local people."}
{"text":"This place is cool to have a drink, play some games and watch sports.. But don't even think about ordering food! I've eaten here 3-4 times around midnight and it's been awful most the time.. And I don't expect bar food to be amazing but this is garbage.. Makes pts seem gourmet.  Shame on the owner for buying super crap ingredients.. The pizza seriously tasted like reheated frozen pizza... The chicken fingers and wings taste like they have been in a deep freezer from the 80's.. I always bash the food when I'm here with my friends and they say, \"it's not that bad, you just have to know what to get\" ha! The 2 stars is for the bartenders who are always great and the draft beer selection.. Yo SCOOTER! How bout you go eat at your namesake joint about 1 am any given day and let me know what you think..."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best burgers in the whole city.
Come Monday through Friday between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. for the amazing lunch specials. 
It's a little Smokey because it's a bar but that staff is always very very nice and customer-friendly.
I also like coming here to watch the UFC fights.
The place is one various awards for its bar food which is all amazing."}
{"text":"Since this is the pub for Seattle Seahawk fans decided to stop in and catch the preseason game against the Vikings. Arrived about 6:30 and had no trouble finding a seat.  Ordered a beer and my girlfriend ordered a margarita. For dinner we ordered burgers.  My girlfriend ordered her's well done.  It arrived nearly raw in the middle.  We sent it back and she got one that was cooked properly the second time.  Other than that the food was great and really good service.  Had a fun time cheering on the Seahawks!"}
{"text":"I think our office staff is really addicted to this place. It is probably the best sports bar in town."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool ya


I've visited this place a few times 
Each time for a little something different 
And each time 
I've been pleasantly rewarded 

They have video games 
Pool and shuffle board 
Darts and drinking 
Even gaming machines 
For those feelin lucky ducky 

Today I swung by to try the food
And let me tell you 
Chicken Caesar salad the way it's intended 
On a cold plate cool lettuce 
Evenly coated with dressing 
Topped with hot chickens nicely diced 

From young to old
This place has a little something for everyone 
Including chilled shots of jäger and patron 

If your local and need a spot 
This is the place for you 


ps: anyone needs a good cook, our chef at scooters pub is a talented man..his veggie pizza is outstanding"}
{"text":"Outstanding wings and service, and my server was ridiculously beautiful. Definitely a must for football games!"}
{"text":"Service was good and food was great and beer tasted good. WTF when I got the bill they charged me $8.50 for a pint Ballast Point Sculpin. $10.50 for the large glass. Thought this was a neighborhood bar not the strip. I will still come back for the food and UFC fights but I won't be ordering overpriced beer."}
{"text":"This place is always outstanding! Fun, friendly people come here all others stay away! The staff is always fast, friendly and prompt! The burgers are all really tasty and the clam chowder looks delicious! The happy hour prices are incredible and cheap. Great sports bar and they have shuffle board and pool tables."}
{"text":"One of the bars that has ufc! Good drinks but chicken wings could be more spicy than sweet"}
{"text":"Niners and their fans like to say \"Who's got it better than us?  Nobody\" but clearly here's one more thing Seahawks and their fans have better than them besides a Super Bowl win in this century. haha. Seriously this bar serves way better food and has a way better environment than the Niners bar down the road.

Order the Pastrami Burger you won't regret it. It's a burger with pastrami piled on top in a bun. It's not small.  Sorry I didn't take a good pic so didn't. It was delicious on a its own but I dumped some of your typical condiments (A1, ketchup, hot sauce) on it which also doubled as what I dipped my curly fries in. I'm sure if there was an option to throw an egg on it I'd do it next time. This was already done but now will they throw on some bacon!? haha I don't like to usually change things especially when they're already good but why not. The curly fries came seasoned.

They have a decent Happy Hour that go Monday-Friday 3pm-7pm and 12am-3am. $5 on various apps like wings, fingers, a mini nacho, I've had the potato skins and mozzarella sticks. 50% off domestic drafts. 

They have a separate dining area from the bar area but really why would you not sit at the bar. I didn't notice a smoke smell. The bar is decorating in a lot of sports memorabilia including a Joe Montana Niners jersey. They have various bar activities like darts, billiards, and shuffle board. A number of TVs. And from what I heard free showing of UFC events which it gets packed for. 

Their beer selection are ok, not a lot of craft beers, but the service, the pastrami burger, and the environment are all they needed to makes me a fan. Niners fans don't fill bad cause I think theres a bar in Henderson that has a very nice selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"Food was good...  quick food all night.  Nothing amazing but it did the trick"}
{"text":"I was here for a pre season game. We came 30 mins before kickoff and were lucky to find a table near the bar. The wait on service was a little long, but totally understandable because this place was PACKED and the entire staff was running around with smiles and warm personalities. 

The atmosphere-for a pre season game, mind you, was awesome.

We ordered some chicken fingers and fries that hit the spot. Also had some deep fried Oreos later that were eh. I've had better elsewhere, but still good.

The one thing I would like to see changed is the decor. I understand it's a sports bar first, but I would like to see a heavier PNW influence. More seahawks, mariners, even sounders stuff. They have a plethora of team banners that kind of clash if you're going to call yourself a hawks bar"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for my 40th with a group of friends, we landed in Vegas the same day the Hawks and Niners squared up for Thurs Night Football and found out about Scooters and cannot believe how Bad A** it was to be in Vegas and feel like we were in Seattle! The atmosphere was fantastic,  the people were great and food wasn't too bad either! Definitely will be back on game day in the future! Go Hawks!!!"}
{"text":"I'm staying at the hotel right next to this bar so it's really convenient if I just wanna go down and get a beer. They whole layout of the bar is a little interesting and I can't say it's really conducive to the bar's success, but I'm not Jon Taffer, so what do I know?
It's just your basic bar w/ pool tables, TV's, food, and some games--nothing special."}
{"text":"At first glance from the outside, you aren't sure what to make of this establishment.  GO INSIDE.  The venue is split into some (private) dining tables when you first walk in and then the bar area behind double glass doors to the left.  Once you walk to the left you are normally greeted by the friendly bartender and have a wide range of options to sit / game / dine / imbibe.  At the bar, with numerous options on draft (Stone IPA - we have a winner), you can't go wrong while playing your favorite video poker game.  If gambling isn't your strong suite, walk over to their ULTIMATE MAN CAVERN.  They have the following available:  Darts, Shuffleboard, OFF ROAD (best game ever), NBA Jam, Street Fighter, Deer Hunter and of course every drinking establishment's GO-TO, Golden Tee.

We come by here at least once a week for lunch and the Crispy Flat bread pizza w/ Buffalo Chicken and Blue Cheese Spread is a staple, however their chicken tenders (never frozen) and Burgers have never let me down.

There is an abundance of flat screen TV's available and this is a Seahawk's Bar so I already know come Sunday, this place will be teaming with Russell Wilson and Marshawn Lynch fans.  Great place to just hang out and unwind after a long day / week / month / year.  

Sunni is an extremely friendly and knowledgeable bartender there so if she's working, go with her recommendations."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my boyfriend to check this place out and sat at the bar. We were immediately greeted by Crystal who was just a super nice and outgoing host! She guided us through the menu, got us our drinks, and chatted for quite a while. She appeared to know most of the other customers and was very attentive. I will absolutely be back in soon to visit with her again. The nachos were my favorite food item that we tried, and the beer was nice and cold... Very refreshing on a hot day! The staff was by far the best part of our experience if you haven't checked out scooters you're missing out :-)"}
{"text":"Needed a spot to hang and catch up with friends.  Rich was warm and welcoming and the food and atmosphere were excellent.  We'll be back.  I had wings and ate every bite"}
{"text":"I love this place, I stop in everytume I am in Vegas. They have amazing food, I've hit a royal here! But the real gem is the staff. Ask for Misty, she is my favorite bartender in town. There isn't a drink she dosent know off the top of her head. She's amazing.  Wherever she goes, we go!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. My boyfriend tried to go to meet friends to watch UFC 190 and both bouncers said the owners said no more people. Come on that is some bullshit because our friends were in their and said they could have let 15 more people in. The real reason is probably because they only had 3 bartenders on a fight night. Come on over staff duh. We will never try and go to this bar again!!!"}
{"text":"Smokey.

Water tastes... ehh.

Local joint.   It's not horrible, but when you'd rather drink the beer than the water, then there's a bit something that needs to be done with filtering.   As with everywhere, if the ventilation isn't good, the place just piles up with smoke and for someone that doesn't like smoke, it's not fun times.  No fun times.

We stopped by because a colleague of mine was in town staying at the Holiday Inn that is right there next to Scooter's and so we wanted to find a place we could talk, drink, and not have to drive too far.

This place sufficed, but I have to say that there are a lot of local joints and this is just an okay place.   Unfortunately, not my first pick of taverns or pubs."}
{"text":"Lisa is the best!!!
We come every week for the Seahawk games, and NEVER have a problem with service with a smile.
Thank you for perfect service with great food."}
{"text":"Cool like bar off the freeway. Has some cool old school games. Big buck hunter was super fun, probably better when drunk."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food but the service was next-level amazing. Our server Lisa was extremely attentive and had the whole table smiling! She suggested certain food items, and we tried them out and absolutely loved it! My parents ordered the nachos with beef chili & it was HUGE! I love the fact that they put green onions on their nachos, that is key! I ordered the chicken Parmesan sliders with tater tots and it was great! You can sub out different types of cheese; I got pepper jack cheese on mine. Will definitely return here & recommend to others."}
{"text":"Went for the Hawks game, good atmosphere, but limited seating. Prices were good, food was good, service was horrible. Slow, rude and acted like we were inconveniencing them when trying to place orders. Not friendly at all, Seahawk crowd is good though."}
{"text":"Great place to be ignored despite being nearly empty. I can't comment on the food because I left without ever being greeted.

The front desk at the Holiday Inn Express assured me the place was great, so I reluctantly returned an hour and a half later. Same result.

This was in the afternoon so maybe this isn't so much of a lunch place."}
{"text":"Scooter's is a cool bar, especially if you're a Seahawks fan.  I recall a few year ago, before the Seahawks were even good, this bar would get PACKED on Sundays.  I can only imagine how busy it will get now that they are the defending champs!!  

I used to go and watch the UFC fights here all the time.  Standing room only, and you get to get there early.  The bar as well as dining room get jam packed.  

There are several old school video games here, most notably a Street Fighter II Champion Edition game!!!  This machine alone is enough for my friends and I to drop by.  They also have dart boards, a pool table, and a shuffle board table.  

As far as the bar goes, its your typical setup.  Not much different from a PTs or Putters.  Where I feel Scooter's excels at is their food.  I can recall the first time I went in.  My friend and I were in the neighborhood looking for a quick bite.  At that time, Scooter's was new.  I don't recall what we ordered, but I remember the both of us thinking, WOW this food is good!!  And I have never been disappointed since.  The appetizer sampler platter is HUGE and only $16.  You get wings, fingers, potato skins, and mozzarella sticks.  The nacho's are also enormous, best part is at the end, you're not left with a pile of chips.  They put a ton of toppings on these bad boys.  If you get their wings, I HIGHLY recommend the spicy garlic.  Another favorite of mine is the pastrami burger + fried egg.  I believe it is a 1/2lb patty with a heaping helping of pastrami, lettuce, tomato, onion, and mozzarella cheese.  This burger was so big, I couldn't even bite it.  I had to take out the veggies and eat it as a side salad!!  

If you're looking for a chill bar to grab a cold one, crazy fun atmosphere for the UFC, or feeling nostalgic for some Street Fighter II, this is a great alternative to the big boy chain.  Who knows, you may even be lucky enough to have Heather as your bartender.  She is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I come here to watch the UFC on pay-per-view and love the way the bar is set up for it. You have a bunch of high boy tables and chairs in one room and the bar in the other. The room with the tables/ chairs starts filling up about 3 hours before the main event. I like to get there early to make sure I get a good spot. I also don't pay a cover by coming that early... though I more than make up for the money on my bar tab :)

Waitresses are friendly and attentive. Though they get really busy by the main event and the entire bar area is full of patrons.

Friends of mine who are big Seahawks fans come here whenever they're in town to watch the games. I hear it's a riot and the bar is filled with Seahawk fans. 

Food is good but standard bar food. Nothing extraordinary. The portions are quite big."}
{"text":"Great UFC bar - no cover charge - Great drink specials - food's pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Ok.... the two stars are ONLY because of the mac n cheese dish .... WHAT HAPPENED???
The first time I tried the mac n cheese I was in love!  I have been to scooter's two more times since my first review and I gotta say the mac n cheese was a complete disappointment! Very bland and watered down .... no flavor at all! I don't know if they have changed cooks? The recipe? 
Blah!

Ok .... done with my rant! lol   Outside of the mac n cheese disaster, scooters is still one of my favorite places to go for a drink! and all the other dishes I have tried have been top notch!"}
{"text":"Im a Packers fan. This is a Seahawks bar. But it's just so awesome. Big E and Rich are the best. I was sad to see Chris leave but family first. The new girl Gretchen is great and so is Eric. Always a good time at Scooters. Darts, pool, shuffle board and arcade games. AND if you didn't know the food is great. The Cook Nacho is like a 5 star Chef out of Beverly hills. I love the apps and especially the Cajun Penne Pasta. Fat shrimp and Anduie sausage. They even have touch tunes for you to play your own music. For someone that's in the service industry this is my bar. Nothing but a good time after work."}
{"text":"Had a great time last night for a going away party with a big group of friends. Talked to a bartender named Rich a few nights before when I brought a smaller group in to do a Pre Party run through to make sure this night would go smoothly. Also called and talked to Rich to make sure kitchen would be open and that we would have a cocktail waitress on staff this night. 

Little disappointed that our waitress took an EO and left around 9pm but it's not her fault. Just made me look like I didn't do my due diligence to some of my friends who suggested to go elsewhere. But Big E the bartender that took over was awesome and we had a great time. 

All the games were working and we had a memorable experience."}
{"text":"First time I ever went to Scooters Pub was for a Monday Night Football game.  It wasnt much of a game (Pittsburgh vs Cincy) but they had halftime and post game raffles and I ended up winning an Authentic (yes authentic, not the cheap replica stuff BWW gives outs) jersey so that was pretty cool. Every time I go there, the staff is always top notch and one of the bartenders even remembered me after months of not being there. There beer specials are usually really good and they're food is REALLY good!  I completely recommend having the sampler platter to try a little of everything.   But no matter what you do, leave room for dessert because you MUST have the deep fried oreos!  They are unbelievable!!!!  I love going to Scooters and if you're a local hockey fan its a great place to watch Wranglers away games.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of my Favorate bars i go to after a long day of work or when i just need to get out the house. 
Home of the 69 beers Great food and specials for events.
THE Staff is great"}
{"text":"Came here for the Seahawks 2017 season opener vs Packers while on a trip to Vegas! It was about a 15 minute Lyft ride from my hotel on the Strip. Arrived about 90 minutes before game time and the place was already packed full of 12s! There were only a few hino I was back home in Seattle. Before kick off, the 12th Man flag was raised in the parking lot. There were raffle drawings for Seahawks items. I had a fabulous game day experience here and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I love Scooters Pub! Great environment, great bar food. Order the jalapeño poppers!! The pretzel bites are also amazing,"}
{"text":"Home of the Las Vegas Seahawkers, this bar is hands down the best place to enjoy football in Las Vegas. Great specials on game days and the Seahawkers are some of the best fans on the planet. A few tips for those coming to enjoy Seahawk games:
- The fan club passes out raffle tickets to anyone in Seahawks attire, so be sure to get your hawk on! 
- If you're not already a member, join the fan club for $15/person or $25/family of four for the year. You'll get access to a special raffle for jersey's at the end of every game.
- Make sure you try a special shot called \"The Hawk Bomb.\" You won't be sorry!
- There's a special dining room that's great for accommodating families with kids or people who need table/booth rather than bar seating. 

Outside of game days it's also a good place to host parties/get togethers or stop by for late night noms. The staff are friendly, the food is great bar food. I highly recommend the Spicy Green Beans and Chicken Parmesan Sliders."}
{"text":"The bar is okay. Our server was great. We went here because it was the only bar listed as a Seahawk bar in Vegas.  What a bunch of unsociable fans of my home town team. If your not in their little club then you really aren't made to feel welcome at all.  

As a Seattle guy that is very involved with Seahawk charities I was surprised by the way the Hawk fans there treat others. The worst of the group had to be the Club Secretary, a power tripping person that told my wife and I that you have to wear Seahawk gear to be welcome.  I would suggest staying clear of this place on game day.  

Go to the opponent's bar, you will be more welcome there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I usually go for the late night happy hour and we absolutely love this place. Blair and mike the bartenders always take care of us! The food, atmosphere and gaming is awesome."}
{"text":"Me and my buddy went here on a whim trying to find some new places around the neighborhood and we were pleased with the service as well as the food. Although it was a Sunday so it wasn't busy, we were given more than enough attention by the staff who made sure we were happy with the food.

Their burger is tasty, as is there chicken avocado sandwich, though they could both use considerably more avocado (I ordered avocado for my burger). I had a potato salad and my friend had curly fries. Nothing was special, but everything was good. We also had some wings which were drenched in spicy garlic sauce (a good thing).

We will definitely be trying some more stuff here because its 24 hours and has a decent number of options to try."}
{"text":"Typical chain type bar. Less than average food quality. Although it appears scratch made, the taste resembles frozen, pre-made. On the higher price range of the same frozen bar food you can get anywhere else. $10.00 for Potato Skins, Really?
Some items are scratch made but the quality leaves a lot to be desired. Pizza crust has no flavor, seems pre-made/mass produced, Burgers are average and not seasoned. No testing of the Entree's as I had no desire to go any farther.

Host UFC Fights yet they are never prepared for the crowds. Understaffed is an understatement. Takes 10-15 minutes to get a drink. Food took close to 30 minutes on both occasions. Untrained staff operating sound system. Continuously turning sound off and turning music on. Only a $5 Cover Charge for UFC fights is the cheapest in Vegas next to Buffalo Wild Wings and that is about the only Positive that stands out. They let the place get way over capacity to where you cannot walk through the place to get to the restrooms."}
{"text":"Being a long time Seahawk fan born and raised in Seattle, in general it's pretty tough to locate an establishment that can replicate the type of atmosphere typically found during games at Centurylink during game day. After finally discovering Scooters, I was pleasantly surprised/relieved/overjoyed to know that I had found home again, as many Seahawks Fans know, being a fan away from home can make you feel like a \"Castaway\"..screaming for WILSON!!! Russell Wilson, that is!

The place is great! It's split up in 3 sections, the restaurant (found right when you walk in), with plenty of booth seating and TV's to watch the game, is extremely family friendly. The bar next to it houses an island bar with TV monitors allowing you to watch the game from every angle, which also includes a \"Hawks Nest\" on one end (a nod to the Hawks Nest found at Centurylink). Finally, next to the bar is the gaming room with a pool table, arcade games, several flatscreen monitors, with, most importantly, a huge wall projection screen spanning almost the entire area of the main wall! It's thoughtfully designed for all types of fans and viewers.

I've been watching Seahawks games here for going on 2 years now. It is truly something special for die hard Seahawk fans, as it's by far the largest congregation of fans in Las Vegas every Sunday and is also home to the Las Vegas Seahawkers, which is officially sanctioned by the Seattle Seahawks. There are anywhere from 200-400 fans on game days.

The people that run it (Las Vegas Seahawkers) are amazing! You immediately feel welcome the moment you walk in, and are greeted with roars, screams and high fives when the excitement kicks in during game time. The organizers of the Las Vegas Seahawkers do a tremendous job of MC'ing/organizing/facilitating excitement during each game with chants, the ceremonial flag waving during touchdowns, raising the 12th man flag before kickoff, and also hold a raffle for prize giveaways. They do everything possible to make you feel at home and welcome and make it a point to make sure that your time there is unforgettable. They even bring in Seahawks players and local Seattle celebrities to join in on the fun!  The last game I saw there the Las Vegas Review Journal (LV's major newspaper publication) was present capturing the excitement and giving away prizes of their own! It's really like one big family in this place and is a must for any Seahawk fan looking to share game day excitement with their fellow 12th man on game day. Truly something special. 

To the gentleman (Ric B.) who provided the less than favorable review. In the nicest way I know how, I would like to say please pull your head out of your A$$! Perhaps you may have misunderstood what the rules were for the prize giveaways, but, in order to qualify, fans need to wear Seahawks gear to receive a raffle ticket for the drawing (Seriously, who doesn't proudly support their team on game day by wearing Seahawks gear, especially when going somewhere public to watch the game?!) For those who for whatever reason forget their gear, I have personally witnessed the club Secretary provide raffle tickets to those with no gear on that claim they are from Seattle. She is one of the sweetest most down to earth people there! Finally, unless you're hiding in a corner the entire time or are anti-social, you are going to receive high fives until your hands hurt and hugs til your ribs hurt during the game, so not sure what you mean by \"unsociable\"? I've met countless strangers that come in for a weekend, usually in town on tourist detail, and have bonded over the Seahawks with every single one of the them! Every single visitor I've met that comes in for their first visit is always in awe of what takes place here. All I hear is: \"This place is incredible! I can't believe how awesome this is!, I will be back next time i'm in town!\" Frankly, it's very difficult NOT to feel the love from your fellow 12th man/woman here! So please, Ric B., get off of your pretentious high horse and get over yourself!

In regards to the food and service, both are excellent! They have game time happy hour specials for food and drink - killer chicken nachos, garlic fries and wings! The waitresses are super attentive,  fast, all smiles and are pretty damn cute! Especially Vanessa - She's the sweetest/cutest there! :) She ALWAYS takes good care us! It's pretty impressive considering there are hundreds of people at these events and she, along with the rest of the staff, pull off phenomenal service and hot food, always attentive to our needs! 

BOTTOM LINE (if it's not already clear), Scooters is THE place to be for ALL SEAHAWKS FANS in Las Vegas on gameday. You will be warmly welcomed, greeted with the \"Northwest Nice\" that we fans are known for, and will find that just by being a fan in this environment automatically makes you family. :)

GO HAWKS!"}
{"text":"I originally stopped in for a meal and to watch the Wranglers' hockey game.  I brought along several of my children and their spouses (who love hockey).  Expecting standard fare bar food, I was more than pleasantly surprised.  

Our meal began with several appetizers.  The roasted artichokes are beyond delicious!  My kids raved repeatedly about both the spicy green beans and the jalapeno strips.  They were delightfully flavorful with just a hint of spice.

Our main courses included the bacon pizza, a philly steak sandwich, cajun penne and the spicy BBQ burger.I tasted all but the burger.  The food was creative, unique and interesting.  The onion rings were fried perfectly and the fries were crisp.

In the third period, they decided to have dessert.  Fried Oreos and Chocolate Brownie.  The Oreos were not impressive, but that is not my style of eating.  The brownie, however, was spot on!

The staff was pleasant, helpful, prompt and courteous.  Like I said, I came to nosh while watching a hockey game, but left telling everyone I know if they want a great little place to eat really quality food (and watch sporting events at the same time), Scooter is a MUST-DO!!!"}
{"text":"Misty is RUDE to the locals!!!! Food was great, as well as the spot!!!! Love scooters"}
{"text":"Went there at 2 AM expecting the kitchen to be closed but was greeted with 5$ specials from 12-3 instead. Got BBQ wings (part of the 5$ happy hour) and a double double burger. Loved them both, and the bartender and cook were both friendly. Can't beat 5$ wings and a 10$ burger as a midnight meal! Definitely going all the time since they're right down the street from me."}
{"text":"We had a group of 9 for happy hour...mostly appetizers and soft drinks.  waitress handling multiple tables but kept us going.  Apps were all good...we tried almost everyone of them.  Waitress very freindly and did her best to cover both sides of the place (bar and dining).  No rush and we had a nice time and got to taste just about every app in the place...Nachos platter huge but not happy hour item...overall good first experience"}
{"text":"The group I was with had a great time at this local pub last night 7.24.16! Once you enter the pub you will notice the main dinning room and to the left is the entry way to the bar that was spacious and made to accomadate large groups. The third room that was adjacent to the bar was a game room with bar stools and tables plus a Pool table, Shuffleboard & various Arcade games along the walls. 

The food was great and the service was on point given that they had a few servers at the time since it was a Sunday. Some of the items that we had that were notable was the Chicken Fingers, they came in two large pieces that look like fish fillet but the breading was light and crispy with a good amount of chicken with curly fries but you have the option of getting plain fries or tater tots. Other items that our group enjoyed were the Southwest Eggrolls and the Homemade Chips and Fresh Salsa that came with 3 sauces (Mild,Spicy,Guacamole).  Portion size are great for sharing especially the small size Chicken Nachos that my friend ordered was delicious. 

Great place to catch a game since they approximately have about 22 Flat Screens throughout the bar, game room and main dinning room. Since the dinning room is seperated from the bar with large windows its good to bring families that want to catch a game together. Will be back if Im in the area or to hangout with friends."}
{"text":"Came here for UFC fight. Despite calling the day before and being told there was no cover - there was a $5 cover. We paid and went inside. Every seat that wasn't empty was \"reserved\". It would've been nice to know we could reserve seats when I called the day before...?! Or that all available seats had already been reserved... But then they wouldn't have gotten that whole cover charge I guess :| They promptly kicked us out of the seats at the bar we settled for since those too were \"reserved\" for gaming. We asked how this works, where do we go, how do we watch the fight and were told \"it's on all around the bar\"... So we paid cover charges to sit down and then be left with no where to sit, while half the seats in the bar were empty but \"reserved\" when we left...What a sh*t show. Besides UFC I'd never recommend this place it was gross small and obviously unorganized. The $60+ we would've spent here we just bought the fight at home."}
{"text":"This place has gone very downhill very quickly! I used to be a huge contributor to the Las Vegas Seahawkers group here and have always recommended this bar for a great and fun atmosphere to many Seahawks and sports fans that travel to Vegas. I've been a big influence, since I'm a hybrid from Vegas & Seattle and have worked as a bartender for the Seattle Seahawks for many years too. 

But when I went to Scooters last month, I was gambling and had put $40 in the video poker machines and unfortunately, I lost, but that's normal and not the problem. The problem was that I had to pay for all my drinks. The bartender failed to communicate anything with me, as I've been a local Las Vegan for years and I'm used to the drinks being comped when you're playing. 

I'll never recommend anyone to this place or ever step foot in there ever again after wasting an extra $35 on that evening's drinks. This is unfortunate, but I'll now have to say bad things about that place too! 

I've also been an organizer for the UW Alumni sports group and would not even consider ever taking the group to Scooter's after this either. Customer service is everything in this city! It's unfortunate that Scooter's doesn't get that. I don't foresee this bar surviving very much longer if they don't comp drinks for people playing their machines."}
{"text":"Go Hawks!  Far as I know this is the best Seahawks bar in Vegas.  It was standing room only for the 49ers game this year, but the standing was worth it. 

I went alone and made some good friends.  Gotta love Seahawks fans!"}
{"text":"Like this place it was chill and drink prices were great. Great for groups but I went during a week day say it was kind if slow but they had a great bar tender! They also have paper view fights so that is awesone!"}
{"text":"Went there Monday night. The female bartender on swing was excellent. When her shift was over the graveyard bartender was terrible. I waited over 30 minutes for another drink but he was too busy watching TV to serve me, and there were only two other people at the bar. My bill with the swing shift bartender was $65.00. I left and will never be back. I guess the owner doesn't mind paying someone to watch TV."}
{"text":"Rude! Just plain rude! We checked into our hotel and were told the place across the way that was opened 24 hours so we decided to indulge in a late night cocktail. When we entered we were immediate told the dining area was closed and directed to the bag area. Before we could even get into the bar good a tall, whit man barked out \"Aye, he can't be in here,\" referring to my son. In a state of shock because did you just yell at me as soon as I walked into your establishment. I explained to the man that we were told they were opened 24 hours but not told kids could not be in there. He then told me that there are signs posted on the doors that indicate no one under 21 could be inside after certain hours. And with that we decided to leave because no way am I spending any money in a place that yells at me. As we left I checked the doors to see if we missed any signs and just like I thought there were no signs posted anywhere. Tomorrow I will go back to file a formal
Complaint with a manager but in the meantime they can guarantee they will never get a dime of
My money."}
{"text":"Ate here last night mostly because I got a restaurant.com certificate. All would have been well and I probably would have looked past a little grundginess and given them 4stars just to be a nice guy. However there was a 16% surcharge added over and above the gratuity. 
First, don't add a gratuity to my bill. I rarely give less than 20% because I was a waiter in college and I know how difficult it can be. So this waitress screwed herself over. Then there was this surcharge probably because I was using a gift certificate. The food was good, choices were plentiful and varied, but the surcharge has left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch UFC 189, not a bad setup. $5 entry for the fights and you should get there early if you want a seat. Separate dining area to the bar so you can have your children with you if need be. Only ordered the nachos and they were edible but nothing super impressive (but its nachos). Coffee wasnt terrible, and the service was again on par. Its a sports pub that didnt have anything great that made me want to come back but its not terrible either so if your looking for a place to gather and watch a sporting event give it a look."}
{"text":"Chris is the best!! Love him long time! Haha.. I've Known him for years. Every blue moon.. I have to show some love and stop in! The food is yummy!! Specially, Fried Green Beans, Caesar Salad, Chicken Tenders, and the Cajun Pasta is scrumptious!!"}
{"text":"Had the BEST hot toddy ever from Chris!!  Most bars don't make them but my throat was sore and Chris offered a hot toddy and customized the drink according to what I liked! Good music, good drinks, you can't loose!"}
{"text":"I love Scooter's Pub! All the bartenders are amazing. Always on top of it, i never have to wait around for my drink. They also have good bar food and affordable. Their Mac and Cheese was perfect comfy food for me. The wraps are also delicious. They have a lot of beers to try. 

Great gaming bar, excellent bartenders, and good bar food. My kind of chill place!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere in the bar. Consistently good service so I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best bar in the southwest. They have great happy hour specials for beer and food. They also have arcade games for cheap as well as pool and darts! We always get great service from everyone!"}
{"text":"I like coming down here on a Tuesday or Thursday night for a drink, late meal and karaoke. The food here is actually quite good - I've had their build it yourself burger (which was yummy and filling) and the chicken strips. Gotta say the chicken strips were less than impressive, but I did like the burger. The beer is good too, and they have good drink specials during karaoke. Thursday is ladies' night too, so having a vagina definitely helps there.

Speaking of karaoke - I love coming down here for Karate Karaoke. Ali Raccoon runs it on Tuesday and Big Sexy takes care of the ladies on Thursday, plus it's usually a pretty short queue.

All in all, if you want to relax and sing a bit come on down and check it out."}
{"text":"Had the BLT with curly fries. It was really good. I'm also a ranch freak and dip everything in ranch. Best ranch I've had in vegas. Now if only I could bring the ranch from here when I go to hooters...."}
{"text":"I come to Scooter's to watch Las Vegas Wranglers home games. There's usually a good, energetic crowd, and they put the game on almost all the TVs, so you can watch it from anywhere in the bar. Otherwise, the location is far from my house, but that's fair for a one-location business in our giant city.

The food is good, but service can be slow if the place is really busy. The servers do a good job of trying to check on you, though. One of my friends swears by the potato skins. I've never had a bad meal there.

Part of the bar has a big screen projector, which is a nice touch for games. You can also play shuffleboard in the same room, so you feel like an athlete as well."}
{"text":"We've had a restaurant.com certificate for Scooter's for a long time, but since it's not near us, we waited until we were within striking distance.  As it turned out, we didn't use it.  

We entered a big room that was completely empty: no gamblers, no diners.  We didn't think it was going to bode well, but the very friendly waiter/bartender said that in his four years there he had never seen anything like it.  We believed him.

There was a lot to choose from on the menu.  I ordered the sirloin sandwich, with a side of slaw, and my husband chose the Chicken BLTA salad which had grilled chicken with bacon, tomatoes, avocado, and shredded cheese.  It was huge, and he had half of it for lunch the next day.  I thought the chicken on his salad looked dry, but when I tasted it, it was surprisingly moist and not oversalted.  

My steak sandwich was another story.  The steak was tough, gristly, and tasted as if it had been marinated in a salt bath.  It was inedible.  The waiter offered to bring me something else, but I wasn't very hungry to start with, so I filled up on the cole slaw and nursed my Apple Orchard cider.  The cole slaw was very different.  It was creamy without being mayonnaise-y, and I deduced that it was made with Greek yogurt.  But after congratulating myself on ordering a healthier alternative to fries, the waiter put me in my place when he told me it was made with bleu cheese dressing.  So much for healthy!

Since my steak sandwich was a fiasco, I was going to give Scooter's three stars.  I liked the place, despite the woeful sandwich experience.  The waiter deducted it from the bill, so of course we weren't going to use the certificate.  But because the service was so excellent, and hubby's salad was so terrific, I've bumped it up to four."}
{"text":"This place never seizes to amaze me!! You should come!! Eric gives personable, prompt service along with Gretchen and all the other gals, the food is delicious, and of course if you have faith, the machines give you generous free play  time or better. Don't forget to tip your bartenders!! Thanks again guys!!"}
{"text":"Was here over the weekend to watch the UFC fight since it was close to the house. Everyone that works in the bar is friendly and their chicken wings weren't too bad either. The place is pretty chill to watch games or fights & it was the cheapest entry fee ($5) for the main event fight compare to ($20 & up) for most bars. Well most likely come back :)"}
{"text":"I have been going here since they opened and I suggested to one of the owners he needed to get buzz time trivia. And he listened!!! I love it that they still have the trivia - I know a lot of people who will go to a place just because of trivia. 

Anyway. Haven't been here in a while and I noticed they took off their ahi tuna salad entree and appetizer!!! Noooooo!!! Those items were the best things on the menu!!!!! Arrrgggghhh. :( 

Settled for the pretzel bites. I love nacho sauce and warm pretzels!! They are very good. My friend and I split the nachos (ordered vegetarian) and they were huge. Delicious too. 

This place is pretty big with shuffleboard and darts in a big man cave room. Huge projector tv. It is very inviting and good for big groups. 

A+++++!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent bar food, fun atmoshphere, and reasonable drink prices...esp during UFC night."}
{"text":"3 words - Chicken parm sliders!! :)

Rapidly becoming one of my favorite pubs to chill at in Vegas... to me, pricing, food, service... they're pretty much everything. The bartenders here are personable, especially the graveyard shift ;) and the chef is also friendly. They have Big Buck Hunter, one of my all time favorite bar games... plus pool tables, karaoke, shuffleboard, etc. Food never disappoints and the pricing is not a steal but reasonable."}
{"text":"The bartender named Patience made me lose all of mine within the course of an hour. This woman was inattentive to me and my group of friends; there were only three of us, we only ordered four drinks among the group, and it took 35 minute intervals between the service of each beverage. The worst part of the experience, however, was that Patience overcharged my credit card and declined to give me a revised receipt AFTER she POCKETED THE CASH INTENDED FOR MY FRIEND'S DRINK. YES, WE CLARIFIED THAT IT WOULD BE A SPLIT TENDER AND EXPLAINED WHICH APPLIED WHERE. WE SPLIT TENDERS TO THEIR APPROPRIATE BILL AND VERBALIZED AND SHE *STILL* MANAGED TO MAKE MY FRIEND'S CASH DISAPPEAR AND MY BILL INCREASE. I hope management reads this and realizes the seriousness of this transgression. Working in the service industry, I know how detrimental it can be if the employees tips are pooled together. Pure greed and bad service. Expect a charge back from my financial institution."}
{"text":"The food is ok. The bar is super dark, and extremely smoky. I know it's Nevada but people chain smoking next to me while eating isn't fun. The biggest issue is they don't take AMEX. You get 15% off as a guest at the Holliday inn express next door which the hotel tells you about, but if you are there on business and only have a company Amex you are SOL."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast, friendly service. Large portions, reasonably priced. Try the chili, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good happy hour prices.  Slow to come out with he food but it was good. Bar tenders seem nice."}
{"text":"My fiance and I stopped in here one night when we didn't feel like cooking. 
First off, the staff is awesome! Everyone was super friendly and the service was fast! The place is clean and, for a gaming bar, didn't smell too smokey....

We sat at the bar to start and each had a beer. The bar tender was super nice and fast. 

We ordered food and sat at a table to eat. The bar tender took great care of us, even at the table. 

We started with the spinach and artichoke dip.... it's amazing!!! We've gone back twice just for that. 

The burger I had was delicious. I built my own with cheese and grilled onions. The burger was juicy and huge and the fries were great! 

My fiance also had a burger and said it was amazing! 

We've been back there a bunch of times and will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Had a turkey club with avocado that was tasty. Nice thick fries but slightly underdone. 

Sat at the bar and service was excellent. Very friendly and attentive bartender (Heather) that was buzzing around. 

Too much smoke and mediocre beer choices bring them down. 16 taps but nothing local. Stone IPA, Guinness, and
Bass were pick of liter. No local breweries in bottle either.


Some decent happy hour specials and it's a Seahawks bar. 

Enough spots around the bar that don't have video machines if you aren't in a gambling mood."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great bar food!
Super friendly service. Bartender is very attentive.

We usually come here after work, late night, early morning. Crowds already gone. Front door is locked for safety. Must ring bell for entrance!

My favorite items from menu:
Grilled chicken and avocado sandwich with fries.
Chicken is tender, cheese is perfectly melted. Tomato slices, red onions and avocado are greatly enhancing the sandwich.
Steak and eggs with hash brown and a choice of toast. The breakfast steak is 6 oz., and it can be a hit or miss. I never had any problems, but last weekend my BF didn't like the steak at all. It had a very sour taste ... I guess to vinegary ... I don't know ... 
Anyway, bartender immediately apologized for not liking the meat, and offered something else from the menu. Also took it off from the bill. No arguments, no ifs and no buts ... very easy transaction. His attitude made the whole experience absolutely great!
It's all about service!
We are definitely keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Awesome service Nina! We came here with 13 people and food came out hot and yummy!  We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I had family come into town and they wanted a laid back place where they could enjoy good food and a baseball game or two. We jumped on Yelp and found Scooters and thought to give it a try. We arrived just in time for happy hour! The waitress we had was great. She answered all our questions and gave input into what she thought the best things to order on the menu were. We received our food promptly and enjoyed a nice relaxing meal while watching some of our favorite teams.

A downside to dining here is they do allow smoking inside at the bar and as we all know, there is no way of keeping the smoke from traveling throughout the restaurant.

Overall great experience and I would recommend it to others looking to just have fun and relax."}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday night. Not too crowded. Smoky, but hey it's a bar. Even the restaurant was a bit smoky, but that can be forgiven. What can't be forgiven is waiting 45mins for our food to arrive. The items we ordered were very straightforward. If there were staffing issues - fine - but let us know there will be a long wait first. That's common practice in most other place we've been to. To make matters worse, when our waitress did bring our food and we told her it was too late, she gave us quite the attitude.

On the bright side, after leaving we went right down the road to Grinder's pizza/wings. AWESOME. 

In short:
Scooter's Pub - NO
Grinder's Pizza - YES"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and service.  Chicken fingers are awesome."}
{"text":"So bummed we wasted time on our Vegas trip to visit this \"Seahawks\" bar. I'm sad that the Seahawks name is even affiliated with this place! Came with 13 people- all wearing Seahawks jerseys. No one cared or said anything- not even our server. I would use her name but she didn't even introduce herself at any point during the service. I ordered the nachos and they came completely dry, didn't even eat them AT ALL and she never mentioned anything or checked up. I originally ordered them with beef and they came out with no meat (not even an option on the menu) and when I asked about it she had the nerve to tell me I didn't say what meat I wanted... even though everyone at the table heard me! And even if I didn't... it's the servers job to ASK! The food was gross and the service was sh*t. No plates were ever cleared and 3 appetizers came out after we had already finished eating. No Seahawks fan should ever come to this bar, no redeemable qualities. Tons of old people."}
{"text":"My fiancé & I come here super late night after work & always have Big E, Eric. Dude is awesome & knows how to bartend. Always gets our orders correct, while being super dope. Food is bomb. Will stay comin here"}
{"text":"From the LA area and needed to watch Seahawks play their first game of the season. Took 2 busses to get here from the strip and welk worth it.  Plenty of TVs and sound. You gotta get the wings."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment looking for a place to sit with friends and enjoy a couple of drinks. I think this bar has great drink prices especially during happy hour or when football is playing. I had a 20 onz miller lite for $3.

Even though there were a lot of games playing the place wasn't too noisy. I actually was able to talk with my friends and enjoy the game. 

The only thing that deters me from coming back is that the bar is very smokey. There were not a lot of people smoking, yet the whole place smelled like smoke. Most of the time it just felt like there was someone smoking right next to me when in reality the closest smoker was nowhere close. 

Overall, great prices. Did not try the food but it did look good."}
{"text":"Great place to catch a fight. They pull down a large screen and have TVs all around the bar. There isn't really a bad spot in the place. I attended a UFC fight and they did charge a $10 cover. Most places charge cover though for the fights, so it was ok. The food was pretty good as well. I had some nachos and a wedge salad. I saw some people ordering burgers as well and they looked really good. The bartenders are all really nice and attentive as well. The place is usually pretty quiet unless a big event is going on. There is one pool table and 1 dart table. Chill place to hang out. The knock on the star was because the people that hang out there are somewhat questionable. I was watching my purse all night."}
{"text":"This is the new home for the Las Vegas Seahawkers so, I will probably spend a lot of time here in the future. They have a ton of beer to choose from and the price are decent. Also the food is fairly decent. I had the Cajun Burger with curly fries and it was very juicy and solid. The fries were good too. Probably the cleanest dive bars I have ever been. My only complaint is that even though they have a lot of TV's they are fairly small except for the projection TV that is not very clear.  However this is defiantly
an upgrade from the previous Seahawks bar Torino's that is probably as bad as it could be."}
{"text":"(7-28-17)
Always enjoy coming here. Food is great. Awesome happy hour specials. Staff is very friendly. Best part it's a Seahawks bar! Been here many times and will continue to come here for Seahawks games."}
{"text":"I have never been to a sports pub before...so I have to say \"boy have I been missing out!\" This pub was the best! The staff is super friendly and attentive. During the game they had raffles with cool Seahawk prizes. They got everyone to go outside and do a flag raising ceremony for the Seahawks flag. It was great! The food and drinks were awesome and the prices were the best part. Food was so delicious!! Will definitely come again when we go to Vegas! I wasn't a football fan before but I had the best time there!"}
{"text":"RUDE!! That somes it up! The bartender on duty (day shift Thursday) was horrible with a bad attitude. Way over priced beers. So guess what? No tip for her!!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place several times but never got around to going.  Wow! Why did I not go? Mostly because this is a Seahawks bar and I'm a Patriots fan who proudly rep's my team (nothing to fight about, but I do wear my gear). I heard about this place last football season and decided to finally check it out.  We came today and what he'd some preseason football, gambled, ate and had some beers.  This was a great experience and I wish I could say the bartenders name, but I can't remember.  My wife and I really enjoyed the food, the gaming and the service.  We will definitely will be coming back for more.  I really regret not coming here sooner but at least we've finally did it.  We are the double burger, pretzel bites and the wings.  Everything was great. My wife and I played video poker and did very well too.  Niiice

We will be back for happy hours and can't wait for NFL to start and watch it here. 

Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't sample the food, but sometimes you go to a bar for one purpose: to have a cold adult beverage with your buds, and that's exactly what I did. The environment is clean and open thanks to super high ceilings and concrete floors. The high ceilings help prevent the stale smoke smell you encounter at most pubs around Vegas. Yes, there is smoking, but it's not as thick as your average video poker hang. We went in on a Friday evening, and there were plenty of tables for our large group. Plus, there were electronic darts, shuffle board and TVs to keep the restless ones entertained. The beer was ice cold, and the service was friendly and prompt. I would definitely head back for some late night eats or to catch a game."}
{"text":"The service is Excellent.  Food is very good.  Great beer on tap  If you are Seahawks fan they have some views for you.
I will be back.."}
{"text":"I love coming to Scooters. They have great happy hour specials. They also have great food. My favorite is the Southwestern Egg Rolls. They also have some bomb spinach artichoke dip. There is usually a spot to sit at the bar to play, but there is also a restaurant section with tables, and a separate room with tables, a pool table, dart boards, and a handful of arcade games. I love coming here to watch the knights games because they have projector screens in the game room you can watch on. When we go we usually have Gwendlyn (sorry if I got it wrong!!) As our bartender. She remembers us when we come in, which I love!! She always does a great job, even when it's super busy. Overall I would highly recommend going to Scooters!"}
{"text":"Came here for UFC 217. The website and poster said there would be drink specials with your paid cover charge for the event, which turned out not to be true (the only thing stopping this place from getting a 5 out of 5). Our waitress was awesome and the pizza was great. Plenty of TVs and not too rowdy at all for an event. We will definitely come back but hope in the future they mention that there aren't the specials which were listed for the event before paying."}
{"text":"A group of Yelpers came here after an event at Shine. I was not expecting this place to be anything different than any other bar. For the most part, they serve the same kind of food as the rest, but how much I enjoyed it surprised me. Carolyn M. had ordered the french dip with curly fries and I kept sneaking a few bites here and there. The fries were crispy and not drenched in oil. Win! The sandwich was also delicious. The meat was tender. The bread had a garlic bread flavor to it and soaked up all the au jus. They also have fried oreos here. Going downtown for this treat is for the experience. Coming to Scooter's is for quality. Each order comes with six of these fatty morsels and ice cream. I ate half of one and stopped. It was ungodly. The cookie inside softens, but still retains a chewiness. It was so good. 

I might drink green smoothies, practice yoga, and exercise five times a week, and eat healthy 75% of the time, but I do it to let myself indulge in these types of days. I might make fun of my friend for her working out to feed her horrible eating habits, but I am really no better. My body is a temple. It clearly loves me for giving it deep fried anything and hates me for putting it through hell to make up for it."}
{"text":"It's tough to let go of the good food and the good people who are here.

One thing I can say for sure is, I'm going to keep coming in until we get out right.

Thanks Rich for going the extra mile on customer service! And Misty 1 and Misti 2 your smile and welcoming hearts keep bringing me back!!!"}
{"text":"1st time going to Scooters yesterday. After waiting almost 5 minutes to order a drink. I had to ask 3 times after giving the bartender my order for a drink to please get it for me. She kept forgetting. Finally the food server got it for me. The service was extremely slow. Food was fair. Was really bummed because I was expecting more after reading the reviews by others before me. Will not be returning. On to greener pastures"}
{"text":"Good food for a bar. Not busy at all on a Friday night. We were the only table in the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"Got the Philly with fries and a Choclate Martini.   So flavorful so good everything is handmade."}
{"text":"Saw their coupon in LV Weekly for March Madness which advertised $4 nachos, $2 for 2 sliders and $1 hot dogs along with $20 match play...so what better place to sweat my NCAA brackets?  Which all fell to pieces this past weekend but that's what I get for watching less than an hour of cbball the entire year.  

My wife got dealt a 9 high straight flush on a 3 play machine the first time we went which took care of the food and then some.  I ended up breaking even but still get $20 profit because of the match play.  That just went to overtipping the super friendly staff anyways.  

The food is definitely better than the average bar with the sliders being some of the best I've ever had.  How are they THAT juicy?  My wife loves the chicken fingers here since they bread and fry them to order.  She jokes that the fingers are so big..they should just start calling them chicken hands.  

Unfortunately they got rid of the $20 match play our next time there since a ton of people were abusing the hell out of it.  Figured as much.  So basically they would only give players another $20 if they lost the first $20.  No big deal."}
{"text":"Stephanie was our waitress and she was fantastic. She had such a warm bubbly personality. And she hit the perfect balance of being friendly yet leaving us alone. 

Dinner for 3 was under $30. $33 with tip. 

The BBQ chicken pizza was fabulous. Thin crust that could hold up the toppings. 

The house garlic fries had just the right amount of salt and garlic. 

The sriracha burger was delicious but a total mess to eat. 

I wasn't thrilled with the decor - Formica tables and TVs everywhere. But the food and service makes up for the decor."}
{"text":"Seahawks Seahawks Seahawks! This is a Seahawks bar.  Seahawks stuff all over.  I came here to watch a game.  We got here about an hour early and barely got a seat at the bar.  The entire place was packed with Seahawks fans, and it's a big place.  It has 3 parts- restaurant part, bar part and a event room sorta place.  They are all connected.  Food here was decent- I had a chicken philly and fries.  It was above average.  Service was good too.  They even have good prices- $7.50 pitchers or Miller Lite when we were here.  If I'm ever in Vegas again during a Seahawks game I will probably watch here.  The only problem was there were a few scuzzy people here, and I thought I was about to witness a fight.  That and having to get here early to get a good seat."}
{"text":"Best burger I can remember having in recent memory. I got the \"create your own\" burger with caramelized onions, avocado, bacon, cheddar, and fried egg. Curly fries on the side to top it off. Love the sports atmosphere. Great friendly service. A++"}
{"text":"Food is always fantastic, my favorite is the Ahi appetizer.  They start it when I walk in the door. Bartenders are Sexy, and all of the staff is very friendly. Great for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I was happy to see that Scooter's became the Seahawks bar.  The location is convenient for me.  While the food was ok and the service was generally ok, the whole experience was tainted by one moment.  My brother in law was playing the machines and in several hundred dollars.  After hitting something not too big (about $400), he cashed out.  Whenever he hit something about that size, he cashes out then starts over, eventually feeding it all back in and then some.  One of the bartenders paid out the cash out and walked away.  He gave the other bartender $20  and went back to playing.  This was the third time that night that this had occurred.  To my dismay, the first bartender went to the other and asked how much he had tipped.  He didn't indicate whether he thought this was enough or not, but either way, that is not the point.  Of course they are primarily working for tips, but to ask this in front of us is rude and unacceptable.  This bartender may have thought he was being discrete, but it was loud enough for me to hear.  By the end of the night, the bartenders were tipped $140, but my brother in law was down $700.  

This may be the only Seahawks bar in town, but I'd rather watch at home than be insulted like that."}
{"text":"My favorite place to meet with friends!! The staff is amazing, the food is amazing, and you can watch any sport you want espically hockey!! I love to come here, I feel like I am right at home!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious food, fast service. If I'm in the area I will be back. They even gave my little girl a free ice cream sandwich how cool is that?! If I'm in the area I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped by to watch a game. I didn't gamble but did eat. Pretty solid menu and big cold beer. I was happy!  Staff was friendly. Lots of TVs to watch the LLWS!"}
{"text":"A first visit to this casual bar and eatery yielded mixed results.  Mozzarella Sticks were gooey.  Spicy Nachos were excellent, along with very good potatoey Potato Skins.  Spicy Chicken Noodle Soup was very good with well-cooked noodles and carrots.  And a Caesar Salad with Chicken and Candied Pecans included big chunks of browned chicken with mostly Romaine leaves covered by tasty Bleu Cheese Vinaigrette Dressing.

Garlic Bread was creamy.  Service was very good, and portions were large.  But Diane did not like her haddock Fish & Chips at all!

3-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you are a Seahawks fan this is definitely the place to go to watch the game. The food is great and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"AWESOME SEAHAWKS BAR! 

Good prices, friendly staff, and I love the shuffleboard, pool and arcade games! Whenever I come to town, this is where a group of me and my friends meet up. Great location for the West side and right of the 215. 

Rumor was said there was karaoke- I say a big THUMBS DOWN! Super lame, that would deter me and a bunch of my friends from going there."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was FANTASTIC!! 
 We stopped in here on a random daytime outing (they have great Yelp reviews) for some food and beer; there was only 1 employee (Bartender) to cover the entire place and she was absolutely incredible. Even though the place was fairly packed the Bartender did a great job taking care of all of us with a huge smile.  The only reason I can't give 5 stars is the smokey environment, I am not sure if the ventilation system was not working or maybe its just always THAT smoke filled?  Not recommended if you don't like the after taste (and smell) of cigarettes."}
{"text":"Stoped in tonight to unwind as I do frequent the place. Yet felt I needed to share how great this place is. It's very open roomy yet without the disconnected feeling most places this size has. The service is always amazing and good food. I come for the staff and gaming. Crystal is absolutely fantastic and my favorite! If you haven't been I would say come in. Just know it does get super busy for Seahawk games as its THE Seahawk bar of Vegas."}
{"text":"This bar is clean, not too smokey and the dim lighting is relaxing. Service is a bit slow but can be overlooked because the staff is friendly enough. I had their double cheeseburger, good burger! $3 miller lite for NFL games is pocket friendly. Only thing I would say would have made it a better experience would be if the server would check in on my drink or food rather than having me ask but then again this is a $3 beer bar so no hard feelings on that. I will come here again when I'm in the area."}
