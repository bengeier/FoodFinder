{"text":"Can't believe it's taken my husband and me so long to try this place.  I'll admit that the name had me thinking it was traditional bar food with more pork than chicken or beef.  Boy were we wrong, and pleasantly surprised. It's truly fabulous! The atmosphere is casual and easy going, but the food is sophisticated and delicious, and the price is seriously reasonable for the quality.  I had the pork shank and my husband had the skirt steak.  The flavors were savory and delicious, and beautifully combined with the sides on each entree. Mine was so large, I took 1/2 of it home. But I'm getting ahead of myself... you must try the fried brussel sprouts appetizer with a fried egg on top... amazing! And we had to have the bacon bourbon bread pudding for dessert... makes my mouth water thinking about it. My only complaint is that they don't have decaf coffee... I mean who doesn't serve decaf??  I hope the management fixes this glitch so that the dining experience is perfect.  And ask for Lotti as your server... she's wonderfully helpful and attentive without hovering.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Gina is the best hostess ever!! She greeted us with the best customer service ever!!  Her happy spirit and warmth made us feel so welcomed. The food is great! We will be back!!!   Thank you Gina!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch during the marathon. The food was alright; they really push the booze, however. Good for some, less for others."}
{"text":"Love this place ever since it opened. The food is unique and the cocktails trendy. Service has been good to very good. It could waiver depending on what time/day you go. It's a funky joint and meant to be. Just hope they can keep things steady in their future. Fun place to take out of town guests. Try different things and share. If Cat is still there, she's your server. Eat and enjoy the Cuban Sandwich... best this side of Miami.... Florida!"}
{"text":"Great service and even greater burger... will be going back to try some other things on the menu. The service was quite good... she even found us some regular yellow mustard...Thanks!"}
{"text":"Reserved the private room for a Christmas party for 16 people.  It was perfect.  The menu selections were excellent and the manager was a pleasure to work with to plan the party.   The huge hit of the night was the pork tostadas - it was served as an appetizer but I could have been satisfied just eating that for my whole dinner.    Service was great.  House made cocktails were delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a Sunday dinner with our daughters, their husbands and children. Our reserved table for 8 was set and ready for us. The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The menu was unique and so delicious. My duck breast had crispy skin and meat that was tender and seasoned perfectly. My wife's shrimp and grits made her feel like she was back on Bourbon street and the boys' steaks were tender and perfectly grilled. The bar was well-stocked and with creative offerings from a skilled mixologist. We all agreed, this was a place that will see us again."}
{"text":"Really cool little spot. I'm in town for business and found this place through Yelp. Jake greeted me as soon as I came in and was also my server. Very friendly and attentive...thanks, Jake! The bartender, whose name I didn't catch was just as attentive.   Good selection of craft beers and even a few classic offerings, like Hamms. I ordered the Cuban Pickle Crisis sandwich, which had chopped pork and ham, tasted really great. I also had the tatie tots, which were more like hush puppies than the tots we all grew up with.   This is a cool spot that is definitely worth your time."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood restaurant.  They have one of the yummiest brunches I've ever had. I've been there for brunch, happy hour and dinner. The food is always great and the service is normally great too."}
{"text":"Mediocre service and food seems to be hit or miss. Our server was quite rude and lazy. Most of the staff hang out by the front of the kitchen chatting which isn't neccesarily bad, but when you are there with family it was hard to hear our conversation over the boisterous wait staff. Our food was ok at best. I had the ratatouille, which had potential...but was so over salted it was like eating spoonfuls of salt from the mortons container.  My daughter had the shrimp with grits, sauce and grits were good, but the shrimp was way over cooked and rubbery. Other daughter had hanger steak which was absolutely fantastic. Staff didn't seem to care that food wasn't satisfactory. Never saw a manager after telling server about the problems. Left 80% of my food uneaten....it was that bad. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I just had lunch here for the first time and it was fantastic!  I had the cuban sandwich and it was stacked with pulled pork, ham, pickles and a wonderful zesty locally produced mustard.  I upgraded from fries to the tater tots which were stuffed with ham and cheese.  I would highly recommend Pig and Pickle to anyone wanting a good spot to eat.  Although I was there for lunch, I also saw they have a great selections of draft and bottled beers, as well as a great liquor selection.  The staff and proprietor are extremely friendly.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you feel like you are a pig yourself go ahead and eat there cuz they'll bring out the slop. When I ate there I felt like I was a pig and they brought slop for me to eat, it was nothing what I expected the people aren't that friendly except for the cashier in the manager. They have some weird twisted view of barbecue food that well, I can only describe as Upper Crust Scottsdale nouveau-riche which is nothing like I imagined it. If this is what rich people eat I don't want to be rich. An overall bad experience."}
{"text":"The best frois gras ... but don't ask me to spell it! Sat at the bar and started with a yummy Templeton rye drink Skot made us with orange zest on top.   Tyler, the bartender,  suggested the pork belly (delicious!!) Cheddar soup and then we had mussels with fennel. We even took the carrot cake home... OMG p & p you should sell rooms for rent for food coma. Thanks Tyler for such a great time - would recommend to anyone who appreciates food and good service. Always,   T&A"}
{"text":"The Croque Madam and Tot of the day are an absolute MUST!!!!  Perfectly poached egg on top of ham with a fantastic Mornay sauce. You will not be disappointed! And the staff is all very friendly and fun to talk to."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food, new favorite local joint. Ladidadida, yelp wants me to say more but all you need to know is this place is super legit."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, better cocktails. A little pricey, but worth it for a good drink. The dim lighting is easy on the eyes. Perfect place to take someone for a laid-back date.  I love the apocalypse sow. It is definitely my go-to."}
{"text":"One of my favorite watering holes. Scot and Zack are great at the bar and give excellent choices. Some great food too. Try the bone marrow and take a whiskey pour through the salty bone. You will like it ;)"}
{"text":"I ate here Sunday 8/4/2013  I've debated writing reviews and decided to go ahead and start, as I find many useful.  I want to give this a 3.5 but it's not an option.  I had porkbelly with heirloom tomatoes as an appetizer over boston bibb,  and Mussel with Creme fraiche and chorizo for the main coarse.  My waiter was a little out to lunch, however, the guy who brought the water was very attentive and checked in on me.  I wish he got the entire tip.  The food.  The tomatoes and dressing were awesome, the pork belly on it's own was decent but the tomato brought out the flavor.  It was like a fancy blt without the bread.  I like the chorizo because it seemed like it was locally sourced.  Not like the fatty chorizo at the buttcher shop in Charlotte.  The muscles seemed a tad overdone.  Overall, the combination was about $40 and the 3.5 rating reflects it was good, priced about right for what I would expect.  But  I wasn't wowed, which I want for any price point-  i.e. a $10 cubano for for lunch I'm trying to objectively compare it to the same price point and rate the flavor accordingly.  So it was good.  I may try them again on my visit as the ribeye infused with truffles sounds pretty good, but I hope to be impressed on a second visit."}
{"text":"Had the greatest experience at the pig and pickle! Was there a couple weeks back, my dad had heard about this place from a co-worker, he went with his employees and had the best experience so he had to take me there while I was visiting!  And what a treat it was!!! The service was outstanding, and the food was just phenomenal! We had the Brussels sprouts, pork shanks, BLT and raspberry vinegar pie. We left extremely full but that was only because we couldn't help but lick our plates clean! I would hands down recommend this restaurant! Oh and I can't forget the cilantragon margarita...if you like a drink with a kick you must try it!"}
{"text":"Night owl alert: serving a late night menu that is really quite nice from 10pm-1am. So many major cities shut down the kitchens at 11, if not earlier. Great beer selection, they know how to curate a tap list even if it's not huge (plenty of bottles and cans to supplement and great taste on all fronts).  Five star service, laid back vibe, clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"He Who must Eat suggested we have brunch at P&P so he had the huevos rancheros I had the rainbow valley farmers cheese blintz... I loved mine but I really craved his! Tasty - rancheros, just right spice with the chorizo the eggs melded all together. So the bloody sconnie was blended to perfection - not too spicy but a good kick.  Not to mention the best service ever!!!"}
{"text":"Service is bad, menu is a moving target, the have enough salt in every dish to make you swell up like sponge bob square pants, the service staff is rude, they don't understand boundaries or social cues and the vinegar pie could be good but it's a coin flip...so if that sounds like fun, give it a go"}
{"text":"Went there twice during a recent visit to Scottsdale.  Food was delicious and very family friendly for an upscale restaurant.  They even gave our one year old a toy to play with!  Try the tots, they are amazing!  The house made charcuterie plate is great, and huge!  Plenty to share.  The beer and cocktail selection is also top notch!"}
{"text":"Yelp is a swindle! You can ad every review you want they choose them for THEIR restaurants! Don't waste time with that site!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times, mostly for happy hour. Lots of fun cocktails, a great craft beer selection. Happy hour specials. Very creative with flavors/textures. Especially like the chicken with curry dipping sauce, the charcuterie board which comes with meats they cure/make in house and pickles they also make in house. Lots of picked things on the board and delicious breads. Had a carrot soup there recently that was delicous. Very much like the liver smear on toast. It would be fun to have a table with my name on it if my work schedule allowed me more happy hours...the artwork is very fun and they sell it, also prints. They have special beer dinners that I haven't been to yet but look like fun. Love the dump truck salad, creative use of cauliflower."}
{"text":"Very unique place, all of the food on the menu is very original and something that blends well and is very good."}
{"text":"I have never left a review on yelp until now because I have never eaten at a place that blew my mind the way Pig & Pickle has. I have lived in Phoenix since 2004 and this place is hands down the best place in Arizona I have ever eaten. My husband and I were here for the late night menu after seeing a show at Pub Rock. Pickled things was delicious. We also had the buffalo pork shanks, awesome! We shared the burger and it has to be one of the best burgers I have ever tasted. Their chocolate chip cookie nutella ice cream thing was fabulous. I plan on coming back plenty of times."}
{"text":"I thought the four star average that I saw ahead of time was fair, though I would give it 3.5 stars.  It met my expectations.  There were some great things that were awesome and there were some good ideas that were slight misses.    Several of us were stopping through the area after a spring training game.  Several had the sow burger. I had the pork belly BLT.  The sandwiches were huge.  The tator tots were a fun thing.  Everyone had a pretty good meal.  I was surprised at their beer selection - they give the impression that they are really into beer but the taps were a bit disappointing.    The pickles were unique, but I didn't really think they were good.  I really thought they should have been much more significant given the inclusion in the name."}
{"text":"You must come here for Sunday Brunch. Everything we had today was mind blowing!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, brunch on Sundays is the best around, and they have a special waffle every Sunday!  The pork belly is spot on, and so is the hanger steak. Great prices for especially for the quality of food.   The service is top notch too!"}
{"text":"Very tastey meal.  The Nancy sandwich is awesome an so is the Pork Belly.  Sevice is prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"I was a first timer here for dinner and was less than thrilled with the service and flavor and texture of the food. We were generally left to our own devices, which is fine because this was a new restaurant and  they were busy and understaffed. The waiter attempted to make up for it by making small take, asking if I got the reference to the name of one of their 'hipsterfied' cocktails; but it was an awkwardly failed attempt. There was an audible and obvious miscommunication concerning our appetizers. We were seating next to order pick up, and our waiter called the chef 'such a fuckin bitch.' Working in a career where others determine your outcome can be frustrating, but really bruh? A fucking bitch in front of the customers and babies??? He apologized to the chef, who also declined his apology. The food was 'hipstered' up...cool name/description, lack of depth of flavor and odd textures. We orders the 'fried' Brussel sprouts and added bacon. The Brussels sprouts were clearly pan seared and the bacon was the only flavor. Our pork belly came out 40 min later, and the texture was odd. It was accompanied by collard greens that were very acidic and surprisingly delicious pomegranate seeds. The pomegranate seeds were the best thing we ate here. For my main course, I had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp were nice sized, but over cooked and chewy. The grits were hidden under some orange broth and they absorbed the liquid and became very wet. The andouille sausage was overlooked and hard. Atmosphere could be fun, but not worth returning to."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour. I love how this place gives such a great farm to table vibe. I'm not a huge meat eater, but surprisingly the bone marrow appetizer was quite delicious."}
{"text":"The only reason for 4 stars versus 5 is the atmosphere. It's not bad, just not anything fabulous.  However, now that we have that out of the way, let's discuss what's really important here.. the food. The food is AMAZING. We began our meal with the pork belly appetizer. WOW.  Pork belly cooked to perfection, resting on top of mashed parsnips with an beautiful apple butter, with sliced apple, almonds, and frise. UNREAL. Was sad when the plate was licked clean, and there was no more. Moved next to the entrees. I had the duck leg, on the yam and faro risotto with blueberries gastric, while my fiance had the pot roast sandwich with havarti, onions, and an add on of more pork belly, and the mac and cheese tator tots. Let's start with mine..the duck. Absolute perfection on every level. The duck did not die in vain, I'll tell you that. Each bite better than the next, until my plate was empty, and my stomach was full. The pot roast sandwich was so enormous, and delicious, my fiance struggled to finish it... and lost the battle.. I've never ever seen this before. EVER. Incredibly sophisticated, yet completely approachable dishes, for no where near what you'd expect to pay for quality like this. Our hats off to the chefs.  These men know their meats, and what to pair with that perfectly cooked meat, to make your dinner an incredible experience. BRAVO Pig & Pickle. We will be back. at $65 for an appetizer, two entrees, and quite a few drinks, this was money very well spent. Oh, and I'd be remiss not to mention, our waiter was absolutely terrific. He was very knowledgeable about the menu, and super helpful helping us choose between the many options that had us stuck on which way to go.   Don't hesitate. Go. Enjoy. Eat the Pig....and a Pickle."}
{"text":"The pork tostada came highly recommended by the manager. Turned out to be pretty soggy and bland. I still see decent menu potential. I have high hopes, I will visit again to see if they deliver on the next try."}
{"text":"Over-priced....you pay $11 for a 1/2 lb burger (which sounds super satisfying) and you get a burger on a  plate with little toppings and no fries.  It was not an $11 meal.  Drinks were good but the food is not really much to write home about."}
{"text":"Every pork dish here is amazing, but there are a lot of vegetarian dishes as well like the shepherd's beany pie and and the nancy sammie. The prices are very fair as well this place is going to do really well!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Love the creative/unique drinks and the food is always good. If you are a bacon fan- this place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & great location. Would recommend this place for brunch, lunch or dinner! Everything is homemade and tastes just perfect. The service is fast, friendly and we got some great recommendations. Our servers name was Eric. I'll definitely come back here if I ever find myself in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and ambience, can't wait to make this a regular experience!"}
{"text":"Very good. A lil Ma's day brunch. Buffet style goodness. Bloody Mary yes please. Not the normal routine. I am very pleased can't wait to have some more."}
{"text":"The crispy skin trout was awesome. I'd come back for that. Comes with a potato pancake and green beans.  Added on a side of pork belly. Yummmmmm."}
{"text":"Never coming back. Our monthly supper club decided to meet here for my birthday celebration. Twelve of us came to have a good time and order lots of drinks and food. My wonderful friends brought cupcakes to celebrate and when we brought them out they told us that we couldn't have them and that they would have to charge us $4 a cupcake to bring them in the back, add a scoop of ice cream and bring them back out to us. The problem wasn't so much that they wouldn't allow us to have them, the problem came when my husband tried to reason with the manager and he was a complete $@#. The manager literally said he had to charge us and serve them to us because it was a health code violation. Ummmmm, pretty sure you manhandling my cupcakes and adding ice cream to it has NOTHING to do with health code violations. That sad, pathetic excuse was all we needed to seal the deal.  Needless to say we said thanks but no thanks and ate them in the parking lot. Sad for them because we would have ordered a few more round of drinks and spent a lot more than $4 a cupcake! Our supper club will never come back and we would recommend to anyone celebrating a special day NOT to show up here. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I love this place for the unique foods and friendly wait staff and bar tenders. I keep going back to my Monsier Coque  (sp) since it is my late night over indulged food with chicken pot pie tatter tots. YUM.  I have tried a few other things like the steak salad and udong noodles are very tasty and really worth sharing.  I love music which is only Friday nights. Unfortunately the room with concrete floors make a little hard to hear at the tables. Maybe just the guitar without the drums could be a suggestion   Otherwise this is must go!!"}
{"text":"What a great place. The food was delicious. I had the slow cooked pork sandwich and fries, which was a very yummy dish. The table had the pork belly appetizer with the heirloom tomatoes and bib lettuce, as well as the foie gras. I had never had foie gras paired with strawberries, but it was an amazing compliment. But truly the best part of the meal was the service. We let them know in advance that we were bringing in a couple to celebrate a special occasion, and they went out of their way to make that couple feel special. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My finacee and I went here one night to celebrate a promotion. We didn't even make it off the starter menu (we had 5 items from it) and we were blown away! Every item is crafted with care.   In addition to the excellent food, we had very nice drinks. The bartenders and staff were very warm and truly seem to care about their establishment.  We are planning on hosting our rehearsal dinner for our wedding here now as well."}
{"text":"We were visiting some friends in Phoenix and went out as a group to Pig & Pickle for dinner. The place was great and the food was also very good. Because we had a larger group we all got to try bites of a lot of different dishes. All of the dishes I tried were great and some were very unique as well. None of the dishes blew me away but I could definitely suggest Pig & Pickle for a great meal."}
{"text":"Pig & Pickle is a great new restaurant! My husband and I stopped here before heading to a concert and we could not have picked a better spot.   We sat at the bar and Jen, our bartender, was amazing. She let me sample several of the happy hour draft beers before deciding on a pilsner while my husband chose a Mexican beer off of the canned beer list. We loved the variety of beer choices, you aren't going to find Bud Light here but you'll be happy with the alternatives!   We started with the beer cheese app served with a variety of fresh baked breads which was outstanding. The tot of the day was pancetta(?), cheese and jalapeño and my husband loved these. For my dinner I ordered the vegan burger with the dump truck salad and both were delicious. Vegan burgers are hard to do but P & P got this right! My husband had the pot roast sandwich with French fries which were fantastic & he raved about the sandwich.   We loved the atmosphere-open kitchen, lots of light shining in, pig figurines everywhere, if you get the chance, GO!"}
{"text":"Wife and I drove up from Tucson to visit a friend. Being we had time to kill and hungry we decided to try something new. Pig and Pickle came up and had great reviews so we decided to give it a shot.  Pulled into the strip mall it's located in and walked in. We were promptly greeted and seated by the hostess, she had a pleasant attitude but the clothes she wore reminded me of a Marilyn Manson video which didn't fit the ambiance of the restaurant.    Waters came to our table quick while we perused the lunch menu. Offerings seemed hifalutin, and a little on the high side for what you get. Read the menu thoroughly and the only thing that sounded good was the P & P Club, so my wife and I ordered one a piece and upgraded to the tots, the bartender/server highly recommended, so we took her advice.   Food came out in a decent amount of time. First glance the presentation was nice. So here goes nothing,  picked up a half of the sandwhich and took a bite, had a fishy taste but none the less ok at best. On to the tots, which I really looked forward to. Took a bite and I went from excited to extremely disappointed, they were extremely bland, tasted like breaded fried mashed potatoes. Ok next thing on the plate was the pickle, the place has pickle in their name so I thought it would be a no brainer and would be the best part of the meal and again was disappointed,  tasted like a under fermented pickle dunked in Apple cider vinegar,  not impressed at all.    We had to wait a bit for our check due to our server tending bar as well. All in all it has a nice interior and is capable of a lot.  But in the end we were highly disappointed at the food we received,  especially for the prices they are asking. If you should go I highly recommend you ask for an onion sandwich with their bread because out of the whole meal those were the 2 best ingredients in our meals. Needless to say we came, we saw, we left disappointed."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! Easily the best and most well rounded bar I accidentally been to. Reasonably priced, top notch service. I haven't had the food but I imagine it's life changing. Strange location but extremely convenient, right off the 101."}
{"text":"Perfect place for beer snobs! I was a bit intimidated by the menu, but the waitress was knowledgeable and helped me choose something my picky, vegetable loving self would eat. P.S. The art on the walls is on point!"}
{"text":"My Sow Burger was AMAZING ... The best burger I have ever had !!! and the dump salad was very nice ... We also had the Cuban Pickle Crises ..!! lol taste is as inventive as the name ..."}
{"text":"So hit and miss.  Happy hour drinks barely have any booze. Our server was horrible, our neighbor's was great.  The flank steak is fantastic.  The pot roast sandwich is just ok. Garbage salad is just ok as well.  I expected more. Maybe just a bad night."}
{"text":"Exquisite menu made from food that is all grown local. Excellent service, extensive local beer selection. Ever-changing menu based on what is locally available and in season, and unique flavor combinations. Everyone will love it on the first try. My friend and I keep bringing our friends and everyone we bring is blown away by the food, and loves it their first time."}
{"text":"Food/drinks/staff/music on Friday night were great and worth 5 stars. Only subtracted a star based on location. This place is too good to be in a strip mall with its patio beside a busy road. To the food... Pork belly and gator bites were excellent but a little over priced at $12 a pop. Hanger steak was great and cooked to a perfect medium rare. Great drink selection and if ordering dessert make sure to get the seared carrot cake. Mississippi mud pie was good too but carrot cake was GREAT."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  They have new, interesting concept dishes and everything Ive tried has been really, really good.  The bartenders (who I think may be owners too) were super personable, and when they asked my friend and I to come back for dessert after the event we were going to, we did.   I hope this place does insanely well and stays open a long time."}
{"text":"I have only been here once, which really is a shame. If I lived closer I would be there all the time! Great food, great service. It doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday there on Thursday and everything was awesome! From the moment I made the reservation to the moment we left, they reserved an awesome part of the patio! Our drinks were always filled and the food was amazing! Thank you so much for a wonderful time!! The k9 guest enjoyed his treats thoroughly as well. Have always loved pig and pickle and now will be a lifetime fan! :)"}
{"text":"First and foremost I have been here many times and it wasn't until now I have felt compelled to write a review. To sum it up in one word...awesome.  Secondly, each time I have been here the food has been delicious, and that's a huge understatement. The food is very unique and the flavored are amazing and mesh well. They have these items called Tots which are filled with something new daily, one time it was this pineapple mixed with something exquisite served with a dipping sauce (this time was nacho cheese dipping sauce.)  Side note, try the seared carrot cake with bacon on top, only if you want the best thing you have ever indulged on in your life. The food alone deserves five stars but I will not end there.   Lastly, the service is beyond five star. Every time, no exaggeration, every time I have been here the service is amazing. Unbelievably helpful staff, very accommodating and knowledgeable about their food. I brought my dog on the most recent visit (Great Dane/Lab mix) which is a large dog, and the staff was very welcoming of him. From feeding him homemade dog treats to moving heaters around to ensure our comfortability.  All in all one of my favorite places to visit in Scottsdale.  I just stumbled upon this amazing place one night and now I frequently cost because it's as close to perfect as perfect can get."}
{"text":"What a great surprise, the menu is great and lots of fun drinks.  Order the grilled brussels sprouts - even if you don't like them you will.  The shrimp and grits held up to New Orleans standards.  Large servings and great service.  Can't wait to eat my leftovers."}
{"text":"Don't get it. For a carne-based gastropub, the best menu item was our salad (which was much too large... over-compensating?).  Everything else was quite forgetable. Much better food at Salty Sow."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this spot since it is close to our house and we drive past it all the time.  Not really knowing what to expect...the menu was a nightmare. When you look at it and try to read it, you feel like its a completely different language.  There are no descriptions or pictures to even help you out.  Basically this is a place for people who like to eat every single part of a pig...including belly and bone marrow.  Just a little too different for us. We tried a few things but the only thing we ended up liking was just plain old macaroni and cheese and tater tots. If you like Guinness beer then you will want to try the Nitro Milk Stout...it was delicious. We can't see ourselves ever going here again."}
{"text":"First timer.  Saw it on Yelp.  Gave it a go.  Got small salad + pork belly ribs alternative.  They tasted ok.  Stringy.... not a 4 star imo."}
{"text":"Another great Yelp recommendation. Dump Truck and Udon (delightfully spicy). Don't get a second Mai Tai if you plans post lunch."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Wait staff is hit or miss, some are really nice some are kinda snobby. Decent drinks too."}
{"text":"This little joint boats a surprisingly good menu for an unexpected location. Great craft beer menu with good food to follow!  Since I'm a vegetarian I have to put the disclaimer out that it isn't your most friendly spot for the non meat eater. However, they do have an absolutely amazing vegetarian polenta pie. I mean this dish is seriously wonderful. The polenta is creamy and the baked vegetables are perfect with raisins added for a surprising sweetness. The shrimp and grits are equally fantastic if you partake in seafood and the meat dishes all sounded creative.   Don't be taken aback by the unexpected location, pig and pickle is a must try. Next time I plan on trying a dessert. The four stars is mostly due to that not all dishes are created equal and you may be more satisfied with one than another. Our service was very good except that it took longer than I'd prefer after our meal to receive the check. I have to be nit picky for my five stars."}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn good ... Definitely have to try the tots so so good . You definitely won't be disappointed ;)"}
{"text":"Food is good. Definitely a lot of pig. I'm not huge on bacon, but I know most people are. However, they do some unique dishes that have been tasty. The prices are a bit high, but this is some nice dining even though it is in a strip mall. You feel like you're downtown when in this place. The menu does change sometimes, but never had anything bad here. They also got a nice small bar set up if you just want to grab a drink. I'm sure I'll keep going back."}
{"text":"First time here. We originally order take out but decide to eat it here when we arrived. The place is cute. Food was great. Our service sucked. This girl had a sour attitude and really ruined our experience. She had no personality or manners to be in the customer service industry AT ALL! Did even tell us bye have a nice day."}
{"text":"What a great experience! Food and staff were better than amazing! Can't wait to go back!!!! Thx guys!!"}
{"text":"I am a Scottsdale native and Pig is easily my favorite restaurant in the Valley. From the amazing owners (Clayton is one of the best guys to exist) to my favorite bartenders in Scottsdale (Skot and Tyler will become yours too just in one night) to the heavenly food (pork shanks) P&P should be your favorite too. One of the only restaurants to be open super late, Pig is home to a regular crowd of industry people which should say something when a bunch of servers and bartenders want to hang out there after a hellish shift. I promise if you go there once it will become one of your favorites over night."}
{"text":"We have lived near Pig and Pickle for awhile and never went in thinking it was barbecue. Oh, how I regret not checking them out sooner.  This is, by far, the best restaurant meal I've had in years. Inventive, different, beautiful presentation and absolutely delicious food.  The chicharrones are amazing and the pork liver schmear was delicious. Crispy skinned trout - oh my goodness. Every bite was a mouth-watering delight.  Shrimp and grits had the perfect heat and loads of shrimp.  My husband loved his bacon burger with havarti and said it was perfectly cooked.  And desert was strawberry vinegar pie. Sounds weird, tastes wonderful.  This will be our new neighborhood favorite!   If you like inventive food with a twist you must try Pig and Pickle."}
{"text":"Pig & Pickle is a must try! The food is original and top notch. They have some menu items that are on the exotic side, such as the bone marrow, and for the less adventurous items as simple as burgers. I have ordered menu items on both ends of the spectrum and was equally impressed with them. The Steaks I have tried have been perfectly cooked and seasoned and even the greens they are served with are fancy and delicious. I ordered the burger on another occasion and would say that it was one of the better burgers I've had in the city. The fried egg on top of the burger really hit the spot. Pig & Pickle has been busy every time I've been there and has great ambiance, great service, and most importantly great food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my husband and I have been big fans of Pig & Pickle for quite a while now. The food is always delicious and we love how they change things up from time to time. I would normally give this restaurant 5 stars. However, our last few visits have been for a night cap and dessert, ordered at the bar, and a specific bartender (whose name we do not know, but he has shoulder-length blonde hair), has been so condescending, sarcastic and almost rude to us the last two times we have been there, that I doubt we will ever be back. It's sad because this was one of our favorite and go-to places, but this one bartender has ruined it for us. The management at Pig & Pickle needs to recognize when one of their staff is treating customers with disrespect, especially customers who frequent regularly."}
{"text":"Let start with the fact that if I could I'd give 3.5 stars but since I cannot, I have to go with 3 as it defiantly wasn't a 4 star experience. Came here last night for a birthday dinner. We were in their private room which was actually quite large and very nice to be able to have everyone at one large table. We had one waiter, Anthony, who was on point- constantly filling up glasses, bringing extra things we needed right away, and giving great dessert recommendations. I knocked off 2 stars because I was completely underwhelmed with the food I ordered. We started with the beef marrow and crostini and it was very tasty; first time having it and won't be my last. However I ordered the 'apocalypse sow' burger and it was a bad combination of flavors. Essentially it was a pork, sausage flavored, patty with sambal aioli, wwaaaaayyy to sharp white cheddar, some lettuce, and three strips of bacon. All the flavors were competing with each other too much and created an overall unpleasant flavor. I wasn't the only one who felt this way either, 3 other guest ordered the same thing and didn't enjoy it. We got the seared carrot cake and bread pudding to share with everyone for dessert, the bread pudding was Anthony's recommendation. The carrot cake was seriously lacking in the carrot flavor department but the whipped goat cheese frosting on top was okay. Surprisingly, the bread pudding was probably the stand out as the best thing I tried there last night.  I will go back to try their happy hour or late night menus but I most likely won't be dinning off their dinner menu again. Overall- Service-5 Decor/Space-5 Price-4 Food-3"}
{"text":"What a place. Get the Brussel sprouts app with pork belly. Amazing. The shrimp plate was great as well. Nice spot In an usual location (strip mall)"}
{"text":"Food was great but the dinning room was not inviting and the staff was not that inviting either.  Go there for the food not the experience."}
{"text":"Ate here with friends who suggested it during our visit to Scottsdale, so glad they did, everything was amazing. We started with the charcuterie plate with an awesome selection of house made items, loved it!! Next was the pork belly with apple butter and creamy radish purée= piggy heaven! The four of us then shared 3 entrees. Lamb chop with perfect char with med-rare center. Tri-tip with polenta cakes and a rich and delicious bleu cheese sauce. And my favorite, the Duck with picked mustard seed sauce and a wonderful, nutty tasting millet risotto! Yum!!  Our service was great, knowledgeable and welcoming. The owner, who was expoing at the line right next to our table came over a few times and talked with us. We left happy and full and for 4 people and over 6 dishes and drinks only spent $150. For those complaining about price, get real! Love this place and will look forward to coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I had an early dinner here on 8/21. It was awesome. There was really fun music at a level that I could hear, but it didn't overwhelm me. There are televisions going, but I kept forgetting they were there. The staff is super friendly without me wanting to puke, and they are really knowledgable about the food. It's good to see that the people who work there, eat there. Really good sign.   However, I hope that they don't eat there every day. The food is so rich! I'm going to make this a once a month stop. I'll get as big as a house if I try that.   The beer? INCREDIBLE. If they have the Yeti- drink it.   The food? Shut your whore mouth. It was SO good. They asked me if I had room for more, and I shed a single tear while asking for the check."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was awesome. Drinks were so well crated and delicious. We had the 'William Joel', barrel aged drink. My husband and I didn't have dinner here but the dinner looked promising and if the dinner was anything like the prom shoulder appetizer we tried then I'm sure it would be good too. Definitely will return to this place when we are in the area. Also forgot to mention the very creative and tasty strawberry chocolate Rice Krispie cake, yum!'"}
{"text":"Love the tostadas!!! Yummy! The tots are my favorities, there are new ones every day. Also the drinks are amazing"}
{"text":"Pig and Pickle! Before I dined in, I thought hmm...what a unique name for a restaurant! However after eating their one of a kind dish called, buffalo pork shank I was sold on the place!!!! The pork shank was packed with flavor as well as a nice spicy buffalo sauce that kept you licking your fingers for more!   My girlfriend and I went for their late night menu and was blown away by their menu for \"happy hour\"! We will definitely come back and try a new dish to rave about! Last but not least try the DUCK fat fries!!!!! They're delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't think I even know where to start.  The staff was excellent and the food even better.  I had bone marrow for the first time....but definitely not the last.  This will definitely be somewhere I will frequent.  Porchetta was the bomb!"}
{"text":"These little piggies waddled all the way home...only after savoring the pork tostadas, shrimp and grits, apocalypse sow,  and \"the nancy\". Try the tots too. Holy pig! This place is good!"}
{"text":"Great service! 'Okay' food... Bacon is bomb! But the pork burgers are gross and I hate the pickles."}
{"text":"My bf and I are here on a weekly basis. Always good food and service. We love that there are always new thing to try on the menu, and course the tots!"}
{"text":"This place. THIS. PLACE. So good. Casual atmosphere, live music on occasion, excellent liquor/beer/wine selection of unique options (don't expect to order the usual Jack/Jim/Goose here! Embrace the chance to try something new- we've had some great finds here!), the specialty cocktail list is probably one of my favorites, the whole place has a great laid back feel, with local artist's work on the walls (for sale! Cool of them to support the local artists!). Staff is always personable, funny, and very knowledgeable- chatting with them is part of the fun experience for us when we go there (we always end up with the tall guy with the tattoos- love him!!!). Appreciate that the menu always has new things to try, and every item we've ever had is great- such good flavor and unique combinations in each menu item. Try the tasso, and the pork carnitas! It's nice that they have some vegetarian options, too- the entire menu is a good variety, something for every (adult) palate! Don't leave without ordering dessert- the vinegar pie is to die for (just try it!!)."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, fresh food w/ excellent service and outstanding drinks. Nothing else needs to be said..."}
{"text":"The food was good. The beers are pretty overpriced. Our server was suuuuuper weird and acted like I was dumb when I asked him where something came from (everything is locally made or made in house, so I just wanted to know which of the two). Luckily my friend and I don't care and just thought it was funny. I'd go back, hoping I didn't get the same server. I've had other friends that have had awful experiences and refuse to come here, but I'd try it again. The beers are pretty overpriced though."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner here about a week ago. Wasn't sure what to expect food/atmosphere wise. It is much more of a casual vibe but the food is definitely not your average bar food. I was pleasantly surprised with the trout dinner. It had this brown sugar butter sauce and once I tasted that with trout and fingerling potatoes... I was a fan! Dessert was great. Great atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I ordered the pot roast sandwich and my sister had the vegan burger. The ambiance in the restaurant was good.  The server not so much!  He was very slow getting our order and had major attitude."}
{"text":"This place really delivered a great mix of excellent flavors on a wide variety of dishes, but I want to highlight the crispy skin trout dish.   A ton of great flavors, the almonds, the brown butter and crunch of the green beans.  Skin was exceptional.  I'll admit they called my bluff, as I was thrown off by seeing this on the menu.   Duck breast was really tasty too (w/ the cherries, feta, wild rice, etc.)  A good, thoughtful beer menu, and a waitstaff and bar that knows the beer they are serving."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I've never seen a menu that is so unique, diverse, while being delicious. Do not go here expecting your \"run-of-the-mill\" menu. It's all a new experience, and a delicious one. A lot of care and thought has gone into the menu, however, if the standard \"meat and potatoes\" is your thing, you should probably hit McDonald's. The tots are not really tots and change every day. It's always a treat to go to the Pig & Pickle."}
{"text":"If you want to lose weight eat here. One bite and your done. All the other reviews are friends and family... has to be. Too over priced, for low quality grub. My fries were cold, my burger way under cooked. The best part of my meal was the beer. First time I was so unhappy with a place I actually posted to warn others. Plus no happy hour?"}
{"text":"This place is amazing the ambiance is really laid back the drinks are really good and strong! The pork belly is sooo good it's cooked perfect!! The shrimp and grits with homemade sausage and slices of pork belly soooo good!! We will definitely come here again our waiter was very nice as well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I brought our dog because of all the amazing things we had heard about the dog friendly patio here at pig and pickle. They did not disappoint! Before we were even able to ask, the server brought out a water dish for our dog and a surprise dog treat! On top of that the food here is amazing, I highly recommend the Cuban missile crisis. Will definitely be coming back to try more of this amazing looking menu and treat our dog to some more of their homemade doggy biscuits."}
{"text":"Met a group here for dinner, expecting to try the vegan burger but opting instead for the vegetarian chili. The \"vegetarian chili\" arrived in an enormous bowl (think mini crockpot) and consisted of a thick layer of cheddar cheese, mixture of mashed potatoes, scallions, and more cheese, with a light layer of pinto beans on the bottom. This combination was every bit as delicious as it sounds, but I was floored that anyone would attempt to pass this dish off as \"chili.\" Whatever the name of the dish, I was delighted with the 1/4 of it that I was able to finish!   We also ordered the Tots as an appetizer and they were absolutely delicious. Everyone in the group enjoyed their meals; there were nothing but positive remarks all around. As the name of the restaurant implies, this is the place to go if you're in the mood for comfort food. I think everyone we were there with would agree that this place counts as an indulgence.   Definitely go."}
{"text":"We came here around 10.30pm on a Sunday night after a 7 hour hike in the Grand Canyon.  We read good reviews about it and to be honest it was one of the few, if not the only pretty good reviewed place open at that time of the night. The plaza itself was empty and when we arrived the restaurant/bar only had a few people in it.  We liked the whole pig theme, it was well put together.  We were welcome promptly and advised we could sit wherever we wanted.  Unfortunately we just missed the regular menu cut off, as after 10pm they serve a much smaller late night menu, which we were a little disappointed about.  We ended up ordering the bone marrow, fries, lettuce wraps with kalbi beef, pork burger and sweet and chilli chicken wings.  Although we noticed only 1 person in the open kitchen, the food came out quickly.  The bone marrow was ok, normally I love it, but this was a little too oily for my liking.  The chicken wings were good, hubby finished them all. The burger patty was a little dry.  The lettuce wraps were pretty good.  The fries were good too.  It was pretty much just pub grub, nothing out of the ordinary although they make a mean Old Fashion! Overall we weren't particularly satisfied, it was ok, given we had such as a full on tiring day we thought everything would taste good but we were a little disappointed.   Unlikely we would go back but if we did we'd hope to try the food from the main menu.  The service was great, we can't complain about that."}
{"text":"A date restaurant for that steady partner.  The foods good, good service, drinks are awesome.   My girlfriend love's this place."}
{"text":"Holy foodgasm!  That's a direct quote from dinner here with my friends last week.  We went on a Friday, which I would NOT recommend; the was quite a long wait to get seated.  Service was good, but a little blatantly one sided.  Maybe the server could actually address then entire table, and not just the hot chick....not so subtle my friend, I'm just sayin.    The food here was good.  They didn't reinvent the wheel, or even try to. The menu is a random assortment of someone's favorite foods, each one seemingly executed well.  There is a note on the menu that substitutions will be politefully declined.  I was concerned about this, as with my food allergies, eating out can be tricky.  They were more than willing to serve me a custom grind burger sans bun, with extra lettuce for wrapping.  It came out deconstructed on the plate, with a bowl of fries.  I was disappointed at first that I wasn't offered any dipping options for my fries, but once I tasted them, I understood why.  These fries were excellent. They stood alone, and anything to dip them in would have been an injustice.  Then I tasted my burger. One of my friends also had a burger with the bun and 2 hilariously large tots, and the other had a vegetable casserole? (If I remember correctly). There was a collective silence at the table as we all had our first bite, and stared at each other in disbelief.  No one could believe how simplistically good the food was, and the fact that we all thought so, that's an almost impossible feat.  As a group. We rarely agree on anything food related.    I think the drinks were overhyped a bit.  I had a Moscow mule, which was ok, but not exceptional by any means.  The waiter helped my friend select a beer which she seemed to enjoy.  This place is more Scottsdale than I expected, but that wouldn't stop me from returning; I'd just pick a different night to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I heard great things about Pig & Pickle but we were not impressed by the food. The place has a great atmosphere and is nicely decorated. I loved that the kitchen was somewhat open. The staff members were all great, but again the food we were not impressed with. I ordered the brie sandwich- it was not warmed up and there was a LOT of brie. Now I like brie, don't get me wrong, but it was way too much. I thought it would be warmed up at least. I will say that the salad I had was fresh, so this was a plus! My husband got sandwich which he felt was ok. He also got a side of the \"tots\" which we both were not impressed by. Cool idea to use mashed potatoes but it was very paste like and just not good."}
{"text":"This the first time my wife and i had been here, we really enjoyed the food. I had the mussels in white wine, herbs & tomato with crème fraiche and my wife had pork shoulder tostadas, we were pleased with how the food tasted and the prices are not to bad, only thing is it took a little longer then usual to get our food even with little customers there."}
{"text":"Was excited to check this place out since it seemed rather unique for the area, but the run of the mill food could not save the poor service. This place definitely reminds me of a person who thinks that they are wayyyyy hotter than they really are.   Food was a 3, service and overall experience was a 1, so landed on a 2 rating. Would not recommend. Full review below -   Earlier in the week, my wife called to ask a question about our reservation. She was promptly told we didn't have one (we did) and was hung up on. Delightful. Should have been red flag #1.  When we walked in and the hostess seated our party (spoiler - the reservation we actually had), the atmosphere and I really enjoyed the modified wine bottles that were used as drinking glasses.  Drinks - Beer list was solid and definitely above average for the area. I settled on Dogfish's Festina Peche which seemed refreshing given the recent heat/humidity combo. Going rate for the beer was $7. When it came back from the bar, I noticed that I received it in a beer snifter glass which holds about 10oz. Looked around and noticed that other people in my party had the same pour. Now, I have no problem paying (and have more than I should) $7, $10, $12 for a 10oz pour of a higher alcohol by volume or rare seasonal beer. But $7 for a 10oz (really 8oz since mine was short poured and spilled on the table) fairly standard seasonal that has an ABV of 4.5%? The blatant money grab on the drinks is not a good look.  Food - As happy hour was ending, I decided to order the Chef's Charcuterie board. This was easily the best thing I had. Seemed like an assortment of pickled veggies and an egg with bread, jam and 3 kinds of meat. I can't tell you exactly what was on the board because the waiter just dropped it off in front of me with zero explanation and walked away. For the main course, there really wasn't anything innovative or unique on the menu, so I settled on the pot roast because I was craving it for some reason. Tots were easily the best thing on the plate. Pot roast was kinda bland, definitely needed salt. Aioli didn't really add much and didn't really make all that much sense from a flavor profile in my opinion.  A group of us (11) try a new place every month. This month happened to fall on a birthday. So, we brought some cupcakes as is the tradition. Waiter tells us that in order to serve them in the restaurant, we have to pay $4 a head. When we protest to the manager, he tells us it is a health code violation. So...it's a food safety risk unless we pay you $4 a head? Word of advice, the money grab is bad for business. 11 people who had been there for 2 hours now will not order another $7-12 drink ($77 is more than $44, shocking I know) and will leave with a bad feeling about your place. Not smart.  Overall, food is ok, service is bad, drink situation will make you feel like you need a shower. Spend your time and money somewhere else and thank me later. Perhaps over a normal sized beer?"}
{"text":"We had a rehearsal dinner here at the end of March for our son and his fiancee. It was a little nerve-wracking because we live in Portland OR and made all the plans long-distance. As soon as we got into town for the wedding and walked in the door, we knew it was going to be great. Turned out there were about 35 of us and it went really well. The food was amazing and everyone at the restaurant was very helpful and accommodating, especially Chris who set everything up. We'll definitely be back next time we are in the Phoenix area visiting our newlyweds."}
{"text":"This Place is Ahhh Mazing. The successfully bring upper end bistro style food down to a price point where the average person could eat there weekly. Great atmosphere, nice service, and accomplished Chefs make for a place that is easily one of the best eateries I have been to period."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends to send off one of our friends back home. I've been told that everything here was fantastic. Food drinks and character. Well all of that was beyond FALSE. I was very disappointed with everything that came with this restaurant. The food sucked. I had the some Daddy burger which was disgusting( don't know the name because the menu was cut off). Not fully cooked with the cow still kicking inside of it. Anthony our server was HORRIBLE. Took him 20 mins to just fill up my water. 45 mins for my food to come out when there is nobody here. Just the worse food and worse experience I've had with a restaurant in my lifetime."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Duck, Duck, Pig and Apocalypse Sow were out of this world with flavors!  The Mai Tais were the best we've had outside of Maui! Cool decor and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Thought this place quite pretentious and overpriced. Went in on a whim, not having heard anything about it. Difficult to interpret the menu, guess we weren't sophisticated enough.  The wait staff seemed insulted when ask to discribe the offerings. Had the tapas which were average, broccoli cheese soup which was more like potato soup and mussles and clams with chorizo in creme fraiche. The portion was large but odd juxtaposition of flavors was only initially interesting and half the serving was left on the table. Add one draft and one bottle of beer and the tab was over $60. We won't be back and won't recommend"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. One of the few places in the valley that I will drive 15 miles to spend money on amazing food and drinks. As a foodie I cannot get enough. Bone marrow, amazing. Pork shanks, amazing. Fried Brussels, duck fries, pork tostadas, I can keep going. I'll spend 50$ on food and still want to order more, and I don't have a lot of money.  In a nutshell, this place is the tits. Shout to the late night guys, they're awesome."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! I have always had awesome service and my food has always been on point. Such a great little jem!  Love that it's open late and serves food late. Great for a date or just to go grab some drinks and good food! I highly recommend the duck fat fries :)"}
{"text":"Had a chance to chat with one of the owners -- super nice guy.  Food was delicious and appropriately priced.  Only con: would have liked bigger selection."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here for lunch after a long bike ride. Immediately I knew something was wrong when the waiter stated that they were \"out of chicken\". Steak was ordered medium, came out with COLD center. Wouldn't even qualify for rare. Another party member ordered a sandwich, had extremely soggy bread. Yet another problem with the peanut and noodle dish--was essentially a soup-like mess.   Waited 10 minutes for check. Will never visit again.   Bottom line: EXTREMELY overpriced, subpar food, and snooty service."}
{"text":"Delicious pork shoulder tostadas!! Cocktails were unique and yummy. Pretzel chicken was verrrrry tasty too! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Decent service but the food is not so good. Was expecting something different than designer pork that's difficult to chew and even more difficult to choke down.   Even the vegetarian sandwich my friend ordered was hard to swallow because of the tough grilled bread."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot of reviews but I've eaten A LOT fantastic food. I had literally one of the best meals I've had in a long time and amongst a lot of trendy foodie oriented places. dump truck salad + charcuterie + bahn mi+ seared carrot cake= heaven! everything was great but the carrot cake is not just the best dessert I've ever had but a fantastic dish sweet or savory . oh did I say the service was perfect?"}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing service lovely craft beer options we will be back every time we are in Scottsdale. Kudos to you guys you are doing it right  As a side note we had the  shredded pork tostada added pork belly smoked salmon  brussel sprouts  pot roast sandwich  Friday night fish fry  Nancy sandwich  burger  and several beers all of which was amazing"}
{"text":"I had another restaurant cancel on me last minute, but Pig & Pickle came to my rescue. I was able to bring in 8 staff members for a team meeting, utilize our projector for presentations, AND feed everyone a delicious meal. The food was amazing!! I'm not a vegetarian dish, but I had their veggie casserole and it was one of the best veggie dishes I've ever had! (I may have added some bacon to the top per my server's suggestion when I mentioned I love meat.)   Plus, the staff went above and beyond to help me. They coordinated the space, helped me unload my car, and even asked me if I needed an extension cord for my projector! Good people and great food! I will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there after we saw their restaurant featured on \"Check Please, Arizona\". The food was amazing along with the drinks which they switch out and change on a regular basis.  What most impressed me was the service.  The wait staff was great and the owner gave us a drink on the house after stopping by our table to chat for a while. Total class act.  If you like good food, good drinks, good service - and want to support local business versus chains - then please stop by Pig and Pickle."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a restaurant. We had to leave without eating as the majority of the menu was \"unavailable \" - information which was sporadically passed onto us by the poor waitress on an as needed basis. Drinks were good though...if you don't mind waiting. Do not waste your time!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what everyone is raving about.  After watching Detour's Tavern die a quick death I had really high hopes for Pig and Pickle as it is close to my house.    Went there Saturday night and were underwhelmed.  When we walked in the hostess seemed confused and a waiter was trying to seat us.  There was no structure to how the place was running right from the start.  It is over priced too.  We ordered a 1 sandwich, 1 appetizer and 1 salad.  Add 1 draft beer and 1 Margarita...$60 after tip.  We left hungry because the portions were so small.  The food did taste decent, there just simply wasn't much there.  We got the pork belly appetizer and there were 3 small pieces...it was $10.  We got one of the Sammie's and it was 80% bread with a small amount of pork inside of it.  At one point, I was eating just bread.  The dump truck salad was simply a bowl of mixed green's with hardly any salad dressing...$11.  On top of being underwhelmed by the food, the service was poor at best.  We got our salad before our appetizer and sat around for stretches of 10-15 minutes with no food or drinks.  When we asked for the check, we sat for another 15 minutes waiting.  Keep in mind, this place is small and our server literally had 3 tables to worry about.  I went into the Detour's Tavern one time and thought, \"Wow, this place has so much potential but it won't last here based on this experience.\"  Same thought I had at Pig and Pickle.  It will be gone in 6 months.  It's a place you will walk in to try out and never return to because it is pricey and you don't get much.  There is no reason to go back there.  For $60 I can think of 10 other places I would rather eat that are way better.  I wish someone would just put in a nice sports bar or good pizza joint in this location.  Stop trying to make it something it isn't.  In North Scottsdale this place might survive with better service, but not in South Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We had the fried brussel sprouts, the pork tostados and the shrimp and grits.  Very good on all three. Topped it off with the carrot cake that will make even the fussiest eater learn to love carrots! We were there for Happy Hour and were pleased that HH applied on Saturdays, too!  Servers were helpful, polite and accommodating. Really enjoyed the whole experience and plan to return!"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood restaurant and I have always loved the place. The food is great and the customer service has always been excellent. With that said I'm writing this review because my wife and I went for a drink and bite to eat this past Saturday evening. P&P was celebrating their third birthday and it was fairly busy, but not to the point of out of control. Drinks were good like always and our server was friendly, like always. My concern was more about a comment he made and this is why I'm writing a review. My wife wanted a simple salad but it wasn't on the menu. Our server said he would ask the cooks to do something and then said they probably won't. He came back to the table and said they wouldn't do anything. He then called them princesses. Well listen princesses, the whole reason you are able to cook is because customers come in and spend their money. I hope you never forget that because as soon as you do the P&P will have issues like all the places there before it.... It's a slow slide and you won't notice right away... I will be back because I like the place but I say something now because I left with a bad taste in my mouth and I'd hate to see that become the norm.... I'm not sure why but the dessert menu was also limited to one type of cake that was not very good... One of the things I love most is going there late and having some home made ice cream... This may have been due to the event but I was surprised there were no other options... It wasn't even late. Got there around 9pm...."}
{"text":"What you're about to read is NOT an exaggeration! First let me say that I don't eat pork so I can't speak to their \"specialty\"; however, this place was chosen for a celebration which is why I attended. Anyway, I ordered the fish tacos because it was one of the two items (on the late night menu) that were non-pork/beef and was MORTIFIED! As soon as our waiter placed my plate in front of me my nose was insulted by the scent of (and I will keep this a G-rated as possible) the \"undercarriage\" of a street walker after a very looong day! I CANNOT make this up! I passed the plate around to the entire party so they could \"smell\" that I was not making it up. They took the plate back and I ordered the Udon noodles (very good BTW). However, when my check arrived they tried to charge me an automatic gratuity of 20% that included the cost of the fish tacos in the gratuity! Needless to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"I love the Sunday morning brunch here...   The wait staff any time of day has always been top notch and friendly.  I find that while the food is priced well for what you get the drinks are a bit expensive.  Not a good place to go if you are about the drinks- but food wise?? Chow down!!"}
{"text":"Overall it was decent, but nothing special to warrant a return visit.  I got the Albondigas to start.  It was pretty good but only had 2 tiny meatballs.  The BLT was fine but nothing spectacular.  My fiancee got the crispy skin trout which she liked.  The vinegar pie was extremely sweet, but the taste was good.  Like I said, it was good.  Not great, not bad."}
{"text":"5 stars is easy, the unbelievable selection of beer, wines & whiskey makes this an automatic. Selections you are going to have a lot of trouble finding elsewhere. Limited food menu but should please anyone. Wife was worried, but Shawn suggested the Monte Cristo and it was the best one she ever had. They make their own bread. I had the Apocalypse sandwich, nothing you can compare it to but the world's best burger, and this one is made with pork. If you are a night owl, this is the only place to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing carrot cake! Chip the Waiter was awesome...! We will be back...!.......... ....... .....  .....   ........"}
{"text":"Great service and great food!!  Pork tostadas were amazing. Salty dogs were delish. All fresh juice. Total mixologist."}
{"text":"Very different menu from what I expected.   I had the Cuban pickle crises and it was excellent and the service was good.  Worth a try!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at P&P...I returned because I remember enjoying the food and the atmosphere from the first time.  This time was a disappointment. I had a table out on the patio and my server took my drink order (a soda) and forgot me for 25 min. They comped me the soda, but I was freezing my tushy off by then. I ordered the veggie supper, which was good but unfortunately, had some issues. The asparagus ends weren't cut off completely, so there were woody bits and the turnip was undercooked and extremely bitter.  I hope that P&P kicks it up a notch to maintain such a good standing. The place is great and the concept awesome, so hopefully this review will help!"}
{"text":"Just returned from a much anticipated visit to Pig and Pickle...much to my disappointment I write this in hope that those antiicipating thier own visit heed the warning.Following a long day as a bartender addressing the needs of others I eagerly awaited enjoying some new vittles and a new local place .When arriving I was greeted by a very pleasant and joviall bartender Scott...quite a treat. Ordered the croquet sammie and a glass of vino. Asked for house wine and was informed that a pinot noir was the only option....so noir it was. I texted a friend and informed her I was at P n P and feel free to come over and have a drink/nibble. My friend arrived and was literally not acknowledged for 10 minutes. Scott was no where in site. There was a man who we later found out was one of the owners behind the bar...not friendly...not attentitive ...certainly not a reason to visit. Earlier when he asked how was my food I stated the food was good but the temp was lukewarm and I would prefer hotter.Clearly he was NOT interested in my feedback and opinions as he scurried off and remained aloof and unavailable. Scott returns and we share  our disappointment with him...he is gracious and apologetic.....we press on, When presenting our check the owner bartender informs us that he has given us the industry discount( awesome) until my friend realizes that she has been charged 12$ for whatshe hoped to be a cheap glass of house wine....much to our shegrin the noir was not . All in all here it is....nice location...nice ambiance, food was flavorful, Scott was a consumate pro, the prices food wise were reasonable...they need a more affordable wine selection for  the working class. I am sad ...I had high hopes. I was  not at all impressed with the surly arrogance of the \"owner bartender\" .He alone,was a deterrent to wanting to return regardless of the food and or drinks. Thumbs down on this experience~ Perhaps wait a minute...let them figure out the error of thier ways and this place maystand a chance-"}
{"text":"Went here for first time a month ago, astonishing! The menu, service and beer were great. I'm a huge whiskey enthusiast and they have a great selection. I enjoyed this place and I will be going back for more pot roast sandwich.....for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I have passed this place several times and always thought it wouldn't make it because of the kind of out of the way location. A chef buddy of mine had me meet him there for a drink and I can say now I wish I started coming earlier. The food is great and the beer selection is awesome. I'm a big fan of the gourmet tots that change daily. I've now tried things here that I never would have other places since the chef will occasionally surprise us. I love sitting at the bar and talking to the staff. A buddy recently ordered some sort of whisky tea drink that came with a french press I think and the bartender did a heck of a presentation and she was super friendly. It is safe to say I now know when other Chefs tell you to go somewhere it is worth listening. This is basically an unpretentious gastro pub that takes chances on the food and beer list and does it well. I crave those tots at least once a week and always wonder what hard to find new beer will be on tap. Great place."}
{"text":"Meat Sweats! Started with fried brussel sprouts - starters are always a good indicator of the meal quality. Shared the Apocalypse Sow - pork burger that crumbled during the first knife cut, it was that freshly prepared. The best part was the pickled pickle - fennel and vinegar - a bite at the back of your throat! The server has been there since the opening, very knowledgeable Irishman. Planning to go again for lunch - while not full of pork, I want to try Brie, avocado and tomato sandwich!"}
{"text":"Some hits and some misses. We had a big party for dinner, but not an unreasonable amount of food was ordered. Service was fine, but we did feel rushed a bit.  The Hits: - Pork belly was really outstanding - cooked beautifully with a nice side of bok choy. - Brussel sprouts were also fantastic as an appetizer. - The duck we had was really well cooked and extremely flavorful.  The Misses: - The pork tostadas were INCREDIBLY salty. Couldn't taste anything but salted meat in there. - The marscapone risotto was pretty bad... very creamy, but woefully undercooked and almost flavorless. - The steaks were tough and really lacked flavor and seasoning. - The pork tenderloin was very, very pink in the middle and didn't have much flavor to it at all. - None of the desserts were particularly impressive - all seemed store-bought.  We probably wouldn't return on our next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I'm gonna go ahead and give this place five stars. Stopped in after wife (Kelly C.) got a tip from you nice folks on Yelp. Took her and the two kids for a mid day meal. We arrived as they opened for dinner. Immediately we were greeted warmly. The waiter was awesome, gave good advice and was very attentive without being overbearing. The kids fish and chips were awesome! I had the ratatouille which was awesome!  One of the best meals I've ever eaten. They bake their own bread which was some of the best! The price was a bit more than i was expecting, but in the end it was worth it. The food was excellent the staff was awesome!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito and waffle were good but when the name of the restaurant is \"pig\" and they serve RAW bacon and call it crispy that is not a good sign."}
{"text":"Great food. Mussels were perfect, bread basket was really nice as well. Only issue was the service which was extremely slow in spite of it not being very busy but the waitress was pleasant so its not like it really ruined anything."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, very large beer selection and a nice atmosphere. The wait staff is always super friendly, attentive and know their menus. Pricea re very fair too for the quality of food you get, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, food, service, and drinks. Cat is amazing. She is like the Superwoman of Pig and Pickle. Cat is always working hard, and taking care of the customers. She is the manager, and is so sweet everytime I dine there. The servers are very professional, and treat their customers like gold. I live so close, that I can even have a cocktail or two and just walk home. :P I had my first Mai-Tai there, and the bartender was so honored to make it for me. It is rare to meet such sincere people! The beany pie, and their tots are so good! I'd like to try their dessert soon, and their other vegetarian dishes. The food is reasonably priced, too! Obviously this is not a fast food joint, so it is going to be more expensive, because it is REAL food-(and fresh at that)! Your taste buds will definitely thank you for eating at Pig and Pickle!"}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday evening, Zack was our bartender. Super nice guy and knows his drinks. Great menu selections for food and drinks. I had the fizzy pickle from the cocktail menu -- very refreshing and delicious. From the late night menu I tried the ghostface tekilla cocktail ($5), was nervous bc I'm not a fan of grapefruit, but it was very delicious and great blend of flavors."}
{"text":"Dang this place is great!   The pig and pickle is a perfect addition to the neighborhood. I went recently we my husband and we had  great experience in every way possible. I love when you can clearly see the respect the chef has for his ingredients. While the menu is very creative it is just simple food done really well.   During our visit we started with the chef's feature oysters and pork shoulder tostadas. I had always been anti-oyster but tried these and loved them! They were small and delicate with a meaty texture, and the citrus on top was a delicious compliment. The tostadas were a nice portion, tender pork with kimchi and a nice aioli. They were very tasty.   For our entrees I had the mussels with chorizo and the husband had the pork trio(Braised snout, pickled nose and cracklins.) The mussels were amazing, I loved the smokiness of the chorizo with the delicate broth,  a really superb dish. Mu husband really enjoyed his pig bits. Especially the flavor of the root vegetable puree.   It also worth noting they have great cocktails and a fantastic beer selection. On this visit we stuck with cocktails, a Moscow mule and Manhattan. Simple, unpretentious and great quality.   Pig and Pickle is an instant favorite and we will be making many visits."}
{"text":"After reading about this place on yelp I've been eager to try this place. It's nearby and the reviews had me certainly intrigued.   We showed up about 20 minutes before they opened which we spent looking the pictures of the dishes on yelp, salivating and mentally choosing our early dinner. When I sat down I told myself no cocktails... Until the drink menu arrived. With a full list of hand crafted cocktails at your fingertips, how do you not go for it? Especially during happy hour? I couldn't and you shouldn't either. Mine was so refreshing I'm not even sorry.   I ordered the clams served in wine and essence of heaven. I loved every bite. It was a little spicy for my sensitive pallet but it was worth it. The bread, that they bake themselves, was incredible. Our waiter was very kind and patient, giving lots of great advice. Not only did I love my meal but I can't wait to go back and try something new! Pig and Pickle, I love you."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness,  that was a culinary experience.    It's our last night in Scottsdale and after 10 pm. My husband says,  \"I'm going to go get some food\"  I told him that I wasn't hungry and to not get anything for me and I might just take a few bites of whatever he gets. Well, he knows me better than that, and brought home four boxes of food.   We got the tot of the day which was a very good start to the meal followed by 1 order of the tongue pastrami sandwich and one order of the pork burger. The burger is called apocalypse sow. Hehe.   I'm not really a fan of tongue so pastrami sandwich, while very good isn't something that I would order myself. The burger, however, was freaking fantastic! I have to say, I've never had a more balanced or better burger. It wasn't even beef! How can I dare say this? It was just that damn good. Soft bread, delicious caramelized onions, homemade bacon, that itself was to die for, and a deliciously seasoned patty. The best.  I would actually consider coming back to Scottsdale just eat this burger."}
{"text":"What a great find! We started with two mega tater tots - which were awesome and a pickle plate. The pickle plate had everything on it from actual pickles to onions, eggs, beets and mushrooms. Very yummy.   I had a \"dump truck\" salad - I guess they call it that because everything is dumped in it. Delicious. For the main course I ordered the pot roast sammy minus the bread, so they served it in a cast iron pan. It was just great, huge portions. My husband enjoyed the beer selection and a juicy cheeseburger. The service was excellent, the restaurant was clean and everyone was friendly. We will return!"}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood spot that packs a big punch! I am a massive pickled fan so we always start with the Pickle Plate that includes pickles (of course), carrots, okra, pearl onions, green beans, a hard boiled egg, and even grapes. All pickled to perfection! The employees are all friendly and full of helpful recommendations.   Be sure to check out their drink menu - you'll be sure to get a chuckle over the drink names (#scottsdaleproblems, my chick bad my chick hood.   I do think some menu items are just a tad overpriced, but that is probably expected in the area."}
{"text":"I'd been to the Pig and Pickle for dinner before about 2 months ago. It was good, but my friend and I were disappointed to learn that the duck fat fries were only available during the late night hours.  My husband and I came back tonight at midnight, and definitely weren't disappointed! We ordered the duck fat fries which came with this delicious vinegar aioli. For $5, the portion size for the duck fat fries was cheap! It was a huge serving!  We also shared the Apocalypse Sow Burger. I came on Yelp to see what was recommended and this burger was mentioned as a must. And it is! It's thick, with thick cut bacon that's cooked crisp, carmelized onions, served with a huge pickle on the side. The pickle had a bit of a bite to it, like jalapeño. My husband was joking that he was about to lick his plate clean bc the burger was so yummy. Either come really hungry or split the burger with someone you love.   I asked the server to recommend a fruity drink, and when he mentioned he could whip up a Harvey Wallbanger, I was game. I'd never had one before, but had heard of them. They were Sophia Petrillo's drink of choice on The Golden Girls-how could I refuse? My husband ordered coffee, and it didn't come out of a pot like other restaurants.   The server made the coffee in a French Press, and brought it out to the table. He told my husband to give it a few more minutes to finish brewing before pressing down on the grounds. It smelled enchanting. The coffee came out nice and smooth; some of the best coffee I've ever enjoyed.   We shared everything, and came out stuffed. This place is about 30 min away from our house, but we'll be back for sure. It was a chill atmosphere; there was music playing but it wasn't so obnoxiously loud you couldn't carry on a conversation. It wasn't busy, which was nice."}
{"text":"I probably need to check this place out in the evening, but my only review is during their brunch. It's probably my own fault for not looking at reviews closer, but the menu is different all day Sundays. We were looking for more of a lunch place, but they offered mostly breakfast items.   I decided to go with the hamburger and my only complaint was the bun. Not very tasty or anything special, seems like they just take it straight out of the store bought plastic. Maybe they only use this type on Sundays? The pictures didn't look like mine. hmmm.   Service: Our server was great, however there was a guy (supervisor?) walking around with a scowl the whole time. He had a pretty bitchy attitude, I could overhear him while eating.   Anyhoo, I will try again another time."}
{"text":"Pig and Pickle is a great gastropub. Their menu is fun and kind of cheeky (a sandwich named \"The Nancy\" comes to mind), and they have an excellent drink selection of American and imported beers, as well as great cocktails. I really enjoyed perusing the menu, though decisions are difficult because everything looks good! I loved their burgers and their tots are amazing. The sauce is unbelievable.  I will say I didn't quite feel hip enough for this place! All the servers and the host looked very cool, and I just rolled in off the street with a friend in our jeans and tshirts. Next time I might wear something a little more stylish."}
{"text":"The food was actually pretty good. I had the p&p Benedict which tasted great. But, I don't think they toasted the English muffin at all so it had that raw bread flavor. My dining companions enjoyed their omelets as well. Someone had an over easy egg that was over hard. But, no real complaints.   Unfortunately I have to dock some stars for the service. Our waiter brought me the wrong drink, not a huge deal. My friend asked if they had diet coke and the waiter said yes. She was brought a bottle of boylans diet cola. The waiter should have specified that it would be bottled and a different brand. Maybe he was hoping she orders refills to increase the bill?   I had to ask for every refill of coffee. Just keep it filled, man. It's brunch.   He dropped off the check. The four of us each put our card in and asked for it split. \"Oh. So I guess you want it split? Next time you should tell us you needed it before we drop off the check.\" So I said, you could also ask if we need it split. He said no, he can't assume that. Maybe it's someone's birthday. What? I've served before. It's not difficult. Its just a four top. You keep track of who had what and at the end of the meal you ask \"do we need this together or separate?\" Or, drop it off and just split it without complaining or lecturing your customers.   When he dropped off the check he gave an incredibly sarcastic \"Havvvveeee a greeaaat day ladies!!!\" We get it. We annoyed you. Learn to grin and bear it and be a professional about it."}
{"text":"I have been dying to visit this place again! The burger I had late one night was fantastic. They also have a great selection of whiskey. What a surprising hidden treasure!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time and had a fantastic experience. We tried 4 different drinks off their lengthy cocktail menu and were pleased with all of them...try the bee sting! The duck leg was outstanding and my friend enjoyed his pork burger as well. The only thing that was better than our food & drinks was the service...our server Eric was spot on! The place is well staffed and the hostess was super friendly. Couldn't ask for more from a first experience. There's no question I'll be back to try the bone marrow!"}
{"text":"We stopped in after purchasing a car for our son.  As you can imagine we were exhausted, tired and starving.  My son and his girlfriend had eaten here several times and raved about the food and service.  We had a FANTASTIC time. The food was to die for and I highly recommend you save room for the strawberry vinegar pie - it takes two months to make and is phenomenal. The food was melt in your mouth delicious.The owner Clayton stopped by and was so personable and friendly.  He found out my husband was retired military and thanked him for his service (my husband was impressed with that).  All and all a great time - go you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. This restaurant is a \"must.\" I wish I lived in Phoenix. I'd come here weekly."}
{"text":"I ordered the ramen noodles with the egg and pork belly. I was dreaming about the pork belly all night. In fact I didn't want to chew it because it tasted so good.  Also my stomach started to growl as I write this review so I might have to go back and get some more.  We sat on patio and it was a chill quiet environment. They had ashtrays if any of your friends smoke...service was pretty good also."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have had a lot of stuff here and nothing fell short of amazing!  Love the staff also.  If you have not been here your life is not complete. You will not be disappointed.  I read some of the negative reviews and I just don't know how anyone has anything bad to say about the food or drinks. Also it is a must to go for brunch sometime.  Ok I am done.  But seriously eat here!"}
{"text":"This is a very cool place. My boyfriend and I went there for the first time this past Friday. Our waitress was very helpfully since this was out first time here, she took her time going though the menu and what drinks she recommended. Her recommendations were awesome. We loved our drinks and our food. We will be definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"My favorite item on the menu so far has been Brussel sprouts. Seriously YUM! I love that everything is fresh made, locally sourced, etc. Love to go here with the girls. =)"}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome. Came here at midnight on a Saturday, absolutely starving. The place was busy but the service was great. We got a few beers and the duck fat fries, which were delicious, but the burger definitely won hands down..perfectly juicy, TONS of meat, high-quality cheese, buttery bun. We were leaving town the next day, otherwise I would definitely have come back here again for dinner. I love the vibe -- perfectly for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"I thought the food was wonderful.  We Ordered Brussels sprouts, smothered in bacon bits, topped with a fried egg....scrumptious.  Also had the pork sandwich with golf ball sized tater tots, filled with amazing flavors.  ( I am a loser and can't remember what  was actually in them, but they were amazing!) The food here is great . They don't have diet coke , but they carry regular coke products in a little glass bottle at $3 each. Bartender claims the owners do not  carry diet coke because it contains  fructose corn syrup.. Seriously! You FRY Brussels sprouts and smother them with BACON for crying out loud!!!  I (unfortunately)  NEED diet coke with savory food.  Sorta like wine and cheese for some. I tried an ice tea and it was so bland, tasted like water. So knowing I wasn't happy with my drink options, (diet coke or diet coke) the bartender (we sat at the bar) gave me room temperature tap water, containing a single ice cube which quickly melted.  Eww.   She could have at least dressed the water glass up with a pile of ice and a fruit wedge of some sort, after all, It was 111 de- freakin grees outside!!! She's amateur, it was obvious.  But the food was  delicious and so this place still gets five stars.  BUT, IF I ever decide to return,  I'd smuggle in my own diet cokes or else I couldn't eat here.  SAD! but it's the way it is.  Also, weird/small selection of beer my husband wasn't happy with, he asked for a chilled glass for his CAN of beer, and the \"bartender\" offered him a can cuzzy, cozy, whatever the hell you call it  instead. NOT OK!!! AND the pickles have a funky taste.  I better stop talking or I'll be changing my five star review. Oh! And they have weird hours."}
{"text":"Finally got to try P&P last night. I came in right as they were switching over to their late night menu, but I had no problem finding some options that sounded good.   I ended up ordering the pork shoulder tostadas, per the recommendation of you fellow Yelpers, and was not disappointed. They were SO good. I'm not sure if I had eaten kimchi prior to these tostadas but I liked everything that was happening in my mouth.   I like that P&P offers industry discounts and good late night eats. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing. Tyler is not only personable but a fabulous bartender. I ordered the Brussels sprouts that were topped with an egg as a late night snack, wow! Definitely a new go to spot for some late night drinks and eats!"}
{"text":"Yummy stuff!  Great place for something a little different. Started with an appetizer of the Havarti cheese with honey, bee pollen, and apricot-vanilla jam. Nice start! I ordered the smoked pot roast sandwich with havarti, caramelized onions and horseradish and my foodie-buddy ordered the pork burger with bacon, aged cheddar and grilled onions.  We would have discussed our food experience, but our mouths were full and it wouldn't be polite  :)   We shared a S'more for dessert which was described as chocolate mousse on a graham cracker crust with toasted marshmallows. We were just a tad disappointed that the mousse was hard as a rock, so when you tried to cut into it, it flew off the plate, making a bit of a mess.  As it sat, it softened some and was a much more pleasant treat, but had to ask for a doggy bag as it was VERY rich.  All in all, great food and good service. I would definitely return for another go."}
{"text":"I wasn't particularly blown away by this restaurant.  We had seen a flyer for it in the lobby of our hotel and after a night at Talking Stick for a concert we needed a snack so we stopped in here since it was on our way.  As soon as we entered it smelled heavenly of bacon, a lot of it.  The gentleman that sat us was very welcoming and friendly and continued to check on us throughout our meal which was nice.  We ordered some apple brandy mules and a couple of 'snacks'.  We tried the buffalo pork shanks and the Duck, Duck, Pig.  Both of these are very good sized plates.  While the pork was cooked very well and was nice and tender on the shanks, it came drowning in sauce which was a turnoff.  The DDP was nicely put together though and very tasty.  Drinks were great and service attentive, we would be back if we were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My Dad and I came in for lunch today. I have been wanting to retry this place since I moved back in the area.  Stood at the front for a couple of minutes wondering if we should wait or seat ourselves... Finally the female bartender came out from behind the bar and told us to pick a spot and she brought over menus.   We ordered the Cuban sandwich and Brussels to share... The bartender/server talked us into getting the tots as our.   Water glasses were empty the majority of the time. When food came out it was cold, the bread was burnt on our sandwich, and the Brussels were cold and extremely greasy. Our girl never came back to check in and so we semi ate our food be we were both extremely hungry. Overall the Brussels were not touched and both of us tore apart out sandwiches to eat what was edible. For too very hungry people we maybe ate 30% of our food. My Dad said all of the fries food tasted like old oil and joked that the kitchen must have been too busy cleaning and breaking down lunch service than cooking our food.  When she finally came back to clear out plates she asked how everything was... My Dad is very straightforward and he told her the Brussels were greasy and the sandwich wasn't very good... She said \"sorry about that\".  Bill came, tots were an up charge and were terrible... I'm definitely not cheap, but don't hard sell a side for $2 that was cold and barely eaten. No attempt to fix or rectify the comments made about the food. I definitely don't expect comps, but at least some acknowledgment of way below par food and customer feedback. We put cash in the book and she asked if we needed any change... Yes I need change back! So unprofessional and rude. There are much more professional ways to ask.  This was one of my worst experiences overall as of late between service and food. Many people has told me this place had gone downhill, but I wanted to give it another try. My Dad had a bad first and last impression and we both left hungry."}
{"text":"I liked the risks they took with the menu.  The chef did a really nice riff on the Hawaiian dish poke.  The salad was very good.  Nice mix of different greens and well dressed.  Just enough dressing to coat the leaves.  My favorite dish of the night was bone marrow.  The serving was huge and just absolutely yummy.  The last dish was the pan sauteed white fish over couscous.  Pretty delicious."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here on a Friday night for dinner, and we picked it based on the reviews we read. We thought it was going to be busy, but it was pretty empty on the inside. We sat and got served promptly. The drinks we both had were good. For the entrees we shared the mussels and the hanger steak. The mussels were ok; the broth was lacking something. The skirt steak we got was better though. We ordered it medium and it was pre-sliced for us, which made it easier for us to share.   In my opinion, this place was decent. The server was friendly, and they didn't have music very loud or anything so that was nice since my friend and I were catching up. If I'm looking for a place that I can get sat quickly within old town, I might come back here to try it."}
{"text":"Unique menu, friendly and attentive service, well-prepared food! However, I have an embarrassing confession...  Months ago, I was having one of the worst weeks at university, stresses piling on, 8 hours of homework each night. It was a nightmare. I was at my limit (you know that feeling, where you just want to tear your textbook in half and throw your computer off your balcony?) but then thought to myself, \"You know what would make me happier than anything right now? A delicious Pig & Pickle BLT.\" So I headed over, dreaming of one of the best BLTs I've ever had, and how it would soon make my stresses drift away. Flavorful pork belly, tasty pesto, and juicy tomatoes. It even made my 'not-impressed-by-BLTs' fiancé a believer.  Lo and behold, when I sat down and opened my menu... it was no longer there. I asked our server, and he confirmed. And (here's the confession part) I totally went to the parking lot and cried. Seriously. SO! Overall lesson (aside from not to put all your hopes and dreams into food): Yes, their food is *that good.*  Also, Pig & Pickle, I'm moving nearby. So if you decide to bring back that BLT, I'd be forever grateful (and probably forever occupying your restaurant)."}
{"text":"I ordered the Brussels sprouts with the egg and they were so so so good! I also had the spicy albondiga soup and it was so yummy with the avocado on top it was perfect! I cant wait to go back and have more of their food. And more brussels sprouts!"}
{"text":"Have to try the Apocalypse Sow (ground pork) burger with bacon, it was WONDERFUL.  Also enjoyed the dump truck salad, skirt steak lettuce wraps, and pork shoulder mini tostadas. Service was very good.  Price were reasonable.  This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch( because of the reviews from the Yelp peeps) with my 22 year old son, who's palate is beyond spoiled......  He takes a bite.....\"Seriously?!\"...sits back, while chewing, sits up again, takes another bite.....\"Uh\".....  takes a swig of his beer, looks at my plate, takes a bite of my sandwich, asks me if I'm gonna finish the last bits of the pork belly we ordered first, uh yah?... Just gonna say.......FREAKIN' HEAVENLY!!!! Taste buds went nuts!!!!!!  Pork Belly to start  He had the Braised Pork Cheeks with grits I had the Cuban Sammie  Luckily for us, our hotel wasn't that far before we fell into a very satisfied, Pork Coma!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. Visited during happy hour. Got a Rose and the tacos. The meat in the taco was super flavorful and there was a pickled pepper in the mix somewhere that was really amazing. I had heard about their tater tots, so I ordered 3. The tots are not like the normal ones. They are large pieces that have different flavors. I got a pulled pork one. It was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Came with a great aioli sauce. The chefs actually comped me one more tot too! The service was great. My waitress was friendly. I will be coming back again to try more items in the menu!"}
{"text":"Fun lunch place!   Mid afternoon beer with some pork belly - uh huh!  And even got some free cozies!"}
{"text":"Best spot in Scottsdale period.   Clayton and Scotty handle the bar extremely well. They offer an excellent array of hand crafted cocktails, craft beer, and wine on tap. No bullshit, they are some of the best in the business.   Keenan and Josh run the kitchen. From the countless times I have dined here, I cannot find one complaint. It is a restaurant that makes it very difficult to try the same thing twice, as you want to try something different every time. My personal favorites have been the Apocalypse sow, smoked salmon app, and anything involving pork belly. They absolutely crush it. Fresh, local, and unique cuisine is offered on the daily.   Find out when they offer beer pairing dinners. They provide you with a chance to try some awesome food, paired with chronic brews. Seats run out quick, so jump on them when you can.   This is my favorite restaurant. Try it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! They have really great service and the food is ALWAYS amazing! My favorite is the charcuterie plate, they serve it with house made bread and bacon jam that will make you wonder why you never put bacon in your jam before. Anyways with a group of 11 no water was left unfilled and we didn't have to ask for anything!"}
{"text":"Okay. I have an obsession. But really. I have not been more excited about a new business as much as I have with this one.   First off I hate pickles so at first I was hesitant that when I went in everything would be made with pickles. This is not the case at all.   They have wine on tap. (Ummm yes please) Tots of the day. (Yes that's right they have a different \"huge\" tot every single day! Only 1$) Give a beer board (you can buy a beer for a friend write their name on a board and when they come in its already paid for so they can enjoy)  Amazing staff (I have yet to have bad service) Phenomenal menu (thanks to amazing head chef)  great Bar!!! Clayton is an amazing owner and has an amazing sense of humor my boyfriend an him are always cracking jokes to each other!   Try \"the Nancy\" but add pork belly or bacon!  I'm also a huge fan of their \"cookie-ish desert! My goal is to try everything on the menu but if hard because there constantly changing the menu adding new items and mixing it up! Another highlight is their late night menu! Try the Udon Noodles soooo good!!   The braised duck leg is also a must try!   The only thing that I've had that I wouldn't be jumping at having again was the pork tostadas (not horrible just not my cup of tea)  I'm so happy that this spot is here!! By far my go to and new favorite place in town. Get there NOW!!! And may your first question be \"what's your tot of the day?\""}
{"text":"Oh my gosh....it has been awhile since I've been to P&P....love their brunch, but decided to hit happy hour. Great friendly service even though my friend - Clayton wasn't  there overseeing the operation!    I have to say.,,,P&P's Culinary Creativity is so much fun and a true adventure!  Try their Green Chili Mac n' Cheese with Bacon Topping!  It's a true man's candy!  (Ladies that appreciate real food love it, too!).   Can't wait to stop back again soon and see what they have created on their ever changing menu. Really love their pulled pork kimchi street tacos, too!"}
{"text":"so delish ~ went with my out of town family.  bone marrow was good - i was impressed to see certain things on menu like that and the \"sow\" burger.  i didnt get the burger this time, but the pork shoulders tostada were *incredible*.  The drink menu was superb"}
{"text":"Good food, great staff, bad location."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is good!!  We randomly stopped by this place today and wow, was it a great choice! I had the appetizer pork shoulder tostada (YUM) and the shepards beanie pie (delicious). My companion had the scallops- scallops can either totally suck or be delicious...they were delicious, perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.   GO HERE NOW!!"}
{"text":"I want to go back and see if my second time in the restaurant is as good as the first because if it is I may never eat anywhere else. From appetizers to dessert everything was mouth watering. Comfort food at its finest."}
{"text":"Not a very big place, a dozen regular height tables and about a half dozen high tops. The menu has a blurb at the top which talks about balance.  Balance between sweet and sour, old and new, etc.  I suppose you could almost call this a mission statement because it was evident in each thing I ate.   Here's a nice touch - the hostess dropped off the menu and then came right back with a glass of water.  New one on me but a nice touch.  The waiter appeared a couple of minutes later to take a drink order and instead I asked him for his recommendations from the menu.  He described their duck breast entree in such a way that my mouth was already watering - sold!  While he was talking, I noticed the couple at the next table receive their slices of pie and asked about their dessert offerings.  They must have overheard the conversation because they both gave me a big thumbs-up when he described the process of making the pie the gentleman was eating.    The duck beast served somewhere between medium and medium rare.  I was sliced into about 6 pieces of an even thickness and served over a mixture which included wild rice, spinach, dried cherries, feta cheese, almonds and a mesquite syrup.  When I saw it on the menu it looked like it was a dish that might have too much going on to be enjoyable.  When it arrived in front of me I figured my inkling was confirmed.  I was dead wrong!  The varying tastes and textures absolutely worked together.  Just as mentioned at the top of the menu, this dish was all about balance.  The duck was crispy, salty and tender all at once.  The rice brought another layer of texture while the dried cherries added a certain tang and the mesquite syrup contributed smokiness.  The feta added creaminess and was balanced with the slivered almonds.  Wow!    I have never in my life heard of vinegared strawberry pie.  Apparently, this is an old technique which involves cooking the strawberries well ahead of pie baking and then mixing them into the pie.  There was more to the story which I just can't remember.  What I do remember is the pie.  This really was the most unusual strawberry pie I've ever been served but it was delicious!  The pie itself was filled with a gelatin-based mixture which included the vinegared strawberries in syrup form and a sugary top crust.  Over the top of the pie was a strawberry compote and they finished the dish with creme fraiche.  The first draft had an espresso syrup on the plate but the waiter very graciously removed it when I told him I disliked coffee flavors.  This pie reminded me of eating strawberry shortcake in terms of flavors but not texture.  The texture reminded me of eating pecan pie but without the pecans.  Balance...  Side note: I very much appreciate the recommendations for this place that I received after posting to the Phoenix Yelp talk board.  I probably would not have found this place on my own but I am really glad to have had the experience of dining here on this trip."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the neighborhood - this place is amazing!  Everything we tried - duck leg, roasted marrow, duck ham (!?!) , pork belly - was delicious.  Can't wait to try the late night menu, and I heard brunch is starting soon!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place! Can't wait to go again. We went for happy hour, and was excited to see that it was family friendly as I have an 8mo old. Other families were in there too. Very relaxed and hip sort of atmosphere. HH items were great! Had the dump truck salad and brussel sprouts and was quite full after my meal. The brussel sprouts were suprisingly rich too - in a good way.:D"}
{"text":"Go here immediately and enjoy the food, drinks, and hospitality. Do you like pork? Order the Cuban sandwich! Thin slices of ham and tasty pulled pork are the stars of this sandwich but the house mustard and fresh bread make this sandwich amazing. I added a dump truck salad and it was perfect with this monster sandwich. I'm coming back for the Brussel sprouts & pork belly because not having this in my life would be a sin.   The chef here is a super cool guy that takes pride in his food and thoughtful approach to his craft.  The bar staff, regulars, and chef made a out of towner like me feel like a regular. stop reading and go get a craft drink and eat some delicious pork!"}
{"text":"Really, really delicious food, very creative, big portions, and relatively attentive serving staff. This place is serious about beer! We had three sandwiches and one entree, plus shared a side of their \"tots\" and a pork belly appetizer. Too full for desert!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Pig and Pickle. It was one of the first places that I went with my boyfriend.  The food is always delicious every time and we have never had an issue with any servers.   One of my favorite drinks was Pimmin aint Easy, although I think it has since changed to another name with a slightly different recipe.  The things that always stick out whenever I tell people to go to Pig & Pickle are Tater Tots. You always have to try the tots. They change them everyday and I am always so pleasantly surprised by the amazing flavor that gets packed into those. The other item is only on the late night menu and that is the Duck Fat Fries. I was super hesitant to try them but I am very glad I did. My only warning that if you are tempted to get the pickled plate it is VERY INTENSE. Something that I recommend sharing with a large group. It is good, but lots of pickled items.   The food is worth trying, don't allow the description of the food frighten you. The chef's blend of flavors has not disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite brunch spots; love the super amazing Bloody Mary served w pork belly, a deviled egg, pickled green beans, and more! I wish I had taken a pic! I haven't had a bad drink or a bad meal, ever! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and can definitely say that this is some of the best food in Scottsdale. OH MY GOD the pork shoulder tostadas - AMAZING. To die for!! The duck fat fries are not to be missed either! They have an excellent alcohol selection. Talented bar staff too- they really know their trade. Friendly and fun wait staff. The live music is excellent, and it puts the finishing touch on the unique vibe. The ONLY way I think this place could get any better is perhaps expanding their menu a bit. But maybe that's just me. ;) Regardless, I consider it to be quite a treat every time I visit this place!!"}
{"text":"Some chefs play it safe, but others use their creativity and great flavors to create great food. Great low key yet sophisticated atmosphere and dishes. Try the bone marrow, or the pork belly. Clayton is a fantastic host. Kudos."}
{"text":"Awesome service.  The pork belly is so delicious, its ridiculous.  They make these tots with different ingredients everyday.  Ive had some with corned beef and cabbage, some with hot dogs and smoked gouda, and some other ones with like bleu cheese and bacon.  Best tater tots I have ever had.  They have an eclectic little stoner menu for late nights that is priced pretty well.  I suggest you smoke a j and head out here at like 11.  There is a patio outside and you can eat and smoke out there.  This place rocks.  Its definitely a cool kid spot."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome beers! Food is really different. Get the Tostadas!! They are good, great price too.   Went there for my 40th birthday. We had a really a good time."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place so bad.  The atmosphere is adorable. We chose this based on the reviews.  We just couldn't love the food.  I ordered a Sriracha drink that was more sour than anything and a pork porchetta that I just could not swallow.  We did have some Brussels that were really tasty.  My sister had a sandwich that the juice so soaked her bread that her bread turned to liquid on the bottom.  I generally do not give low marks on unusual food but this was over-the-top awful.  The waitress appeared to be accommodating and then I overheard her mocking us to the cook when all my sister had asked for was some bread that was not total mush. The manager never checked on us or why we were unhappy and they did not even offer to make anything right.  I would never return to this restaurant again and as you can see from my previous reviews, I am not generally very critical.  If the restaurant service had been more interested in customer service, I may have been willing to go back and try some different items based on so many great reviews but will not be back."}
{"text":"I have a ten month old lab that wreaks havoc whenever he's left at home alone, so I'm always on the lookout for dog friendly restaurants. Our waitress was awesome, and immediately brought my pup a bowl of water and a gigantic house made dog treat, which he gobbled down in about two seconds. Between that and the amazing happy hour, Pig and Pickle is one of our new favorite hangouts! Happy hour goes from 3 to 6 daily, and they have an awesome selection of draft beers, cocktails, and wine for only $5. I loved the #scottsdaleproblems, with prosecco, house limoncello, lime zest, and tiki bitters. Their mac and cheese with pepper jack and green chilies is absolutely amazing. You have the option of adding a hefty portion of house smoked pork belly for $4 - best decision ever. And speaking of great decisions, you should definitely get a few of their tot of the day. These things are MASSIVE, way bigger than golf balls; the tot du jour for our visit was bacon and feta - I could've eaten a dozen of those babies. I don't know what crazy magic goes into their aioli either, but it is so addictive! My friend KJ got the pickle plate, which was definitely interesting. I'm not a huge fan of pickles in general (I know, blasphemy) but this plate was something else entirely! They had pickled EVERYTHING, from regular bread and butter pickles and green beans to watermelon rind, cauliflower, egg, fennel and onions. The pickled grapes were surprisingly good. Pickle lover or not, you and your pup will definitely find something you'll enjoy at the P&P!"}
{"text":"Wanned to try something different. Loved their pork belly, their bone marrow, beer tasting that they allowed me to do, support local farms, happy animals, herbs, and gotta say i really really loved their vinegar strawberry pie!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite late menu establishments. They have the best cilatragon margarita I've ever had! Great patio and awesome music. Oh and can't forget about the awesome staff, Chip is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Absolutely  wonderfull The Bone marrow, 2 big pieces, absolutely decedent, warm  buttery, so rich served with buttery crostini  an and herb salad The tator tots, not your average run of the mill tot,  No square potatoes these tots are more like croquet  Served with a spicy aioli, 2 tots belive me that is plenty, so dense and so yummy, Last but not less the Hoop-Dee old school at its best but so yummy. Not a place to miss"}
{"text":"I can't seem to understand the hype around this restaurant. After reading all the reviews on yelp I knew I had to bring my girlfriend here while visiting for the weekend. Upon arrival we were being up charged. We started will the brussel sprouts which were inedible as they were drenched in oil. They are deep fried and all we could taste was the oil. They were disgustingly greasy. Our waiter tried to up-sell us from the beginning of our meal. Immediately, he asked, \"would you like to try _____ or _____?\" Of course these were the two most expensive items on the menu. He also asked us if we would \"like to add bacon or pork\" onto two separate dishes. By the time we finished ordering, we were tired of being pestered to add to our dishes.   When our main dishes came out they both looked great. However both of our dishes had no taste what so ever. Maybe the greasy brussel sprouts had something to do with that.   The prices at pig and pickle also seem to be a little high for being in a run down strip center. I am very disappointed that this was our last dinner in Arizona. It"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Gastro pub extraordinaire. Really great service and the food is very very good. I love how late they're open. We got the burger and it was sensational. They definitely use quality ingredients. I would recommend this place and I will be returning for sure.  The duck fat fries are a must"}
{"text":"I loved my experience tonight. And this sort of experience tells you that this is how this place runs. .always.   House made bread, mayo... real fat, real sugar, real food. .. the chefs make it all here!   The highlights were the BLT, chicharrones (holy shit, they're delicious), their sandwich bread, their mayo, the carrot cake. I could've tried more but fat is very satiating, so you don't have to pig out to feel full, just the bites I had left an impression on me...though maybe I did \"pig out\".haha   I admit there was a bit of a glitch in the birthday girls meal, but they were quick to remedy it, comp it and offer us desert on the house, no hesitation.  That's what I liked: no hesitation, just fix it. .and they did.   Waiter was on the ball and atmosphere was relaxed, not Scottsdale pretentious. .. nice place, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite bar. Awesome selection of whiskey all over the world. Cocktails are cool and theres something for everyone. Always a unique beer selection. Highly recommend for service industry especially late night, they will fulfill your munchies. The staff is GREAT! The chef knows what he's doing, always making some tasty specials."}
{"text":"I love you guys.  You make my heart and stomach so happy.  That being said, this place really cares about who is walking in, sitting down and dining.  I only eat at the bar.  The reason?  I'll tell you why.  I always meet someone interesting.  I always make a friend.  I always find something new menu item from my friends at the bar.    Pssst.  If you like foie, get your ass over here.  It's not a sin.  They do it right.  Don't believe all that PETA propaganda either.    Tostadas.  Man.  I could live inside that little cocoon of shredded pork for the rest of my life.    Salmon.  Damn.  They do it right.  Smoked, white pickles onions on top of a mashed potato pancake sprinkled in Panko breadcrumbs.  I love you guys.  You make me weep.  I'm yours forever."}
{"text":"I love Pig & Pickle.  They're open late night, they have a port that I love, the place is fun, it's in a great location before going out at night.  Last time we were there they were playing old school hip hop and rap, it was hilarious.  Our group usually goes on Sunday nights.  Some of our favorites are the tot of the day.  They do these huge tots usually filled with lots of cheese, meat, and accompanied by some kind of dipping sauce.  We got the duck fat fries, seared foie gras, and the wood oven roasted bone marrow with crostini and onions.  The fun thing is after you eat the marrow, the bartender will pour a shot down the bone!  My absolute favorite thing is the pork shoulder tostadas with ginger aioli, kimchi, and scallions.  It's the perfect Korean Mexican fusion, and the pork is so tender and juicy, and it's so messy to eat but so worth it.  Dessert!  We've gotten this deconstructed smore, this awesome meringue  thing, The Elvis, a deconstructed pb&j thing, and a friend got the carrot cake and they loved it so much.  I'm bad at remembering names, and the desserts change around a bit.  But they're all yummy."}
{"text":"I have now eaten here four times and every time is a great experience! Service is very friendly and the food is outstanding. All of the food is made from scratch and with lots of love. The place is spotless, it's an open air kitchen and you can see that it is cleaner than most hospitals. Try anything pork and the clams with chorizo. One of my top five favorite places to eat in the US!"}
{"text":"Brunch is Amazing. Hungry or thirsty or both. Try the biscuits and gravy, or the lox. Everything on the menu is amazing. The bloody Mary Pig And Pickle. style with belly though? Omg Jordie Bird I love ya."}
{"text":"I use to go to Pig & Pickle every time I visited Phoenix, and now I live here. I discovered it a few blocks away from a friend's apartment. I love pork and anything pickled so the name took me in immediately.  We always get the charcuterie: delectable bits of cured meat with pickles and bread. We've also ordered the grilled octopus, pork liver smear, pork shoulder tostadas, mussels, bone marrow, foie gras, duck breast salad, and other things that I can't remember the exact name of and are no longer on their ever-changing menu. Aside from the grilled octopus which was a tad too salty, we have loved everything we've ordered. But the food isn't the only great thing about Pig & Pickle, they also serve delicious cocktails, and if you get there during happy hour the prices are pretty nice.  Pig & Pickle is a place I frequently recommend, and will always come back to."}
{"text":"It was alright and thats about it really!  When I visited it was for a friends birthday and so there was a fairly large group (8 people) and so you expect a slightly longer wait for food - which was fine.  The only disappointment was the quality of food as I'd be building it up in my head all day at work thinking about how amazing it was going to be, but it was just a bit average. Nothing was bad per say, but this is why it's a 3 star review not 4 stars.  Beer selection here is great though and the servers are fantastic - they'll talk you through which beers suit which dish or taste and advise you on what to try. I always like it when servers interact more personally and show a genuine passion for what they do!  A nice evening for a friends birthday and a good spot for a group. It just didn't set my world alight."}
{"text":"I met up with a good buddy of mine for a little catchup, a little ambience, and some yummy food.  We were excited to try this place for the first time so here's how it turned out:  Great parking was a pleasant surprise when we arrived at 6 on a Friday night.  I live in Central Phoenix so hardly ever encounter that treat.  Got there before my buddy and was warmly greeted before being seated.  The interior was lovely, warmly lit, and had a nicely-moderated noise level (another pleasant surprise).  The patio had gas heaters and some comfortably upholstered seating so we settled in to get caught up.  I'm on a bourbon kick right now so my server recommended a delicious cocktail.  It also had Rye in it and was pink.  Yummy!  My pal had something equally delish with gin and blackberry.  Equally delish!  This joint has some signatures, one of which is tater tots.  The selection on Friday had baked beans with a side of barbecue sauce.  Wow, they are just yummy!  We both ordered a sandwich based on our server's suggestion.  It was a kind of pork burger, covered with bacon, and it was good.  My only quibble is that it seemed overly salty to me and may benefit from toppings that balance the pork out a bit.  We both had the fries and our server brought us both ketchup and barbecue sauce for dipping.  A nice gentleman came out to ask about our experience and he seemed genuinely interested in our feedback.  So....the next visit will be focused on tots, pink drinks, and a new treat.  I'm looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Note: must like pickles or really good drinks   Basically they are a bar with several really good bartenders who have unusually wide breath of liqueurs to choose from. I went with a buddy (George Meyers, AKA \"Da MAN en da No\") who knows these types of unusually awesome places and was pointed in the direction of a Irish whiskey I had never heard of and am now destined to buy stock in, Green Spot! Remember that Whiskey, Green Spot. YOU WILL LOVE IT! before the Green Spot, I tried several other drinks which where all awesome, I can't remember their names because after four or five of them I have my first shot of Green Spot and that was all she wrote. I now am regularly purchasing all that I can get my hands on. Oh yeah the food. It was the best pickled EVERYTHING I have ever had. Even the odd pink pickled hard boiled eggs were good. Weird but good.  Stop by the Pig and ask for a shot of Green Spot. Then try some pickled anything. Because the pickle everything."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken us this long to try this place! Dinner was great, my husband and I both have restrictive diet and they accommodated happily. We both had the apocalypse sow With no bun and it was so good! Also, we are Diet Coke drinker's, they don't have Coke's but they have this great natural soda called Boyln so good!"}
{"text":"Great setup in unassuming part of south Scottsdale.  Beer selection amongst the best I've seen.  Ambiance and service was top notch.  If you like great food(ie) food at a great price, live music and nice people give this place a try."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, GET THE \"Apocalypse Sow\"!!!  I've loved this place since the day they opened. You can't go wrong with any of the food here. It has been my regular neighborhood spot for years now. The beer selections, mixed drinks, and ESPECIALLY the whiskey/bourbon selections are perfect. I usually just eat at the bar because the service is so attentive. But the time that we sat at a table with family, the service was great. Our server, Chip, was amazing. We may have to sit in the dining room more often just to see his smiling face."}
{"text":"Love love love! We had the bone marrow-never had before but it was really good and even better with the jelly. Also the pickled okra on the side was the perfect after-bite for the marrow. I got the duck breast which was also delicious and my husband got the hanger steak which he also said was delicious. His steak could have used a touch more salt and my duck breast pears could have been a little more sweet if we were to be very detailed. The cheesecake was the perfect balance of vanilla and chocolate flavors with some kind of fruit compote. Everything was delicious and the customer service was exceptional. The place was also decorated with really cool pop art from a local artist."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in scottsdale. Great food, moderately priced. Great selection if whiskey and beer, interesting cocktails and well rounded inventive menu.., I haven't had a bad meal yet. The service has always been good.. I would go back anyday for the duck and the dump truck salad. I crave the salad  for lunch, too bad it isn't open then.  I love u pig and pickle"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Great unique menu. Had the BLT and salad. Delish. Nice atmosphere and decor and great selection of beer, wine and cocktails."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Pork.  A very interesting menu with some unique dishes.  Based on the information received from the waitress the menu changes often as they try and utilize available local ingredients."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to give this place a try now that they are open for lunch. Great setting, friendly people, and good food. I had the Cubano sandwich with fries and a sweet pickle and it was excellent. Since I had to go back to work, I stuck with a Coke, and they have the Mexican Cokes in the glass bottle. However, I noticed that they have an excellent selection of craft beers, including two of my favorites, Ninkasi and Dogfish Head, along with a large selection of wine and other cocktails. I also saw a couple be seated on the patio with their dog and the bartender took an actual water bowl out for the pup, which seems like a great idea. I am definitely a fan, and will no doubt be back again... hopefully when I'm not working so I can have a good beer with my meal!"}
{"text":"Closer to two and a half. I think this place has a great vibe and the concept is hilariously awesome. Just the execution of some of our dishes were so-so. Definitely think I could bump up the rating after another visit but this is where I currently stand.  Starting with the drink I ordered, the Maggie. Strawberry and lilikoi are some of my favorite flavors in sweets. But my table and I could agree that the dominating flavors were tequila and OJ. My friend ordered the hard root beer, and it's what you expect except slightly disappointing. Maybe we just suck at picking drinks, I don't know.  We started with the bone marrow since it was a popular mentioned item here. Two thick bones, with buttered toast, okra pickles, and \"peperonata\" that was basically red pepper pesto. The bone marrow was bomb, but I think buttering the toast makes it overkill on the fats. I think toasted bread alone would be great.  My main item was a build your own burger, medium, with duck egg and pork belly, plus tots instead of fries or salad. The tots are amazing, you get two giant stuffed whoppers of amazing potato goodness. Got hints of cheese or something else, it's not just fried mashed potatoes. Definitely worth it in my opinion, but you might get slightly less mass than ordering fries.  What was disappointing was the burger itself. The duck egg was clutch with a runny yolk, and you get a huge slab of pork belly. But the patty itself was underdone for both me and another mate. Mine was between medium rare and rare even though I ordered medium. My friend ordered medium rare but his was underdone as well. With the burger too soft, the runny yolk that's normally awesome become unpleasant to eat. Maybe it's an off day, but 0/2 isn't too hot.   I think this place is a bit pricey, but those tots and burger I did manage to enjoy were great. I'd love to come back and have my faith restored, but my dinner was on a shaky note."}
{"text":"OMG. Go eat here if you want your taste buds to thank you!!!  Start off with the Brussels Sprouts with a fried egg.   Save room for the savory Carrot Cake."}
{"text":"Staff Food Ambience Drinks FOOD music CARROT CAKE WITH BACON! MORE FOOD!!  This spot made my top 5 places to eat real quick, ive gone through most of the menu, and everything has been phenomenal. All unique with their own flavors, modern ideas with a old school twist."}
{"text":"What an interesting piggy place!! Haha / I mean that in a food sense and not in a selfish sense.   Anyway, the giant branded P&P pig on the wall just jumps out when you walk in.  The staff wore shirts with the phrase \"Chicks dig the belly.\" Pretty funny! Friendly staff. TVs near to watch sports.    Then comes the food. :)  Starters: pork belly, chick pea pancake, Harissa, blue cheese n fig.  -This was a great combination put together. The pork belly was good but I've had ones that was more prepared to melt in the mouth.   Soup & Salad: golden beets, watercress, frisée, blue cheese crema, candied pecans, pomegranate, grape molasses with a side of pork belly. - Yummy in my tummy! This gives a balance of light but filling plate.   The Big Show: grilled hangar steak with fingerling potatoes, spinach, pickled beech mushrooms, chimichurri sauce  - Made medium well. Slight red. A little tough but probably don't wanna send it back just in case - ya know?   Sammies: smoked pot roast, caramelized onions, havarti, horseradish cream on white  hoagie bread with side of dump truck fries - Pot roast tasted like any other pot roast. Some pieces were moist. Others were dry. Caramelized onions are always a must. The fries were like any other fries too. Overall content. :)   Sweets: chocolate pecan pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - This is new for me and a win. Delighted with \"new.\"   On the way out I just noticed a cute little piggy bank sitting on an entrance barrel. (Don't know how I missed that. Oh yeah- the gigantic P&P pig on the wall!!). Almost wanted to take it but of course I won't!   A place to enjoy pork belly!! ;)"}
{"text":"Multiple businesses have tried to make it at this location, but I'm really hoping Pig & Pickle is here to stay! My wife and I have already been here twice since they opened, and I know we'll be back many more times.  The menu isn't very long, but everything we've had on it has been outstanding. The service is also friendly and helpful. And the actual restaurant is well decorated and has a bustling, but not loud, vibe to it. Keep up the great work Pig & Pickle!"}
{"text":"Full posted review and photos at: http://forkvsfood.com/pig-and-pickle ------------------  Initial observations at Pig and Pickle are that it's more affordable than Atlas and the menu is loaded with straight-forward, delicious rustic food with just enough global influence to make it interesting.  I'd have to say that the Pig and Pickle really delivered, especially for this being their opening weekend. The food had a nice honesty to it, the price was affordable and the service was good. There wasn't much negative to say about the experience, other than quibbling over minor details and lack of bread with charcuterie. I look forward to return visits, and I'm eager to watch the restaurant and chefs earn some well-deserved buzz in the near future."}
{"text":"I don't generally review places I been to only once, but I feel it's important that future first-time patrons know that this place is probably not what you'd expect. Don't go here expecting to get a bbq pork sandwich and a beer for less than $20. Go somewhere else!  That said, after staring at the menu somewhat undecidedly for quite a while, I landed on a sliced roast beef sandwich (the closest I could get to what I really wanted), the dump truck salad and their tot of the day, and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The food, while somewhat intimidating, is really genuinely good here. Our server was back to check on us pretty frequently and was even nice enough to shut off the misters when we thought it was too nice outside to have them on. Their patio is dog friendly, which I love, and I also enjoyed that it was off the beaten path of Old Town. It's nearby, but definitely sets itself apart from the rest of the restaurants in the area. Definitely a place to try, especially if you're one with an advance palate!"}
{"text":"Always 5*! Food is yummy, always creating great food with local ingredients. Brunch, lunch, hh,  dinner or late snacks always so good! Drinks are something else, from the classics to a great new creation and some good perfect selection of beers -tap or bottle- just the best place for dinner in South Scottsdale"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat in South Scottsdale! Awesome variety of beer and mixed drinks. Service is friendly and quick and if you are lucky, they have live music every now and then. Recommendations: pork shoulder tostadas, tot of the day, duck breast with wild rice. Can't wait for my next visit."}

{"text":"I'd heard great things about this place so was excited to try it, but found it to be okay. We waited around to order, then finally had a server take an order right before Happy Hour ended to get it in before the deadline. Thoughtful, I suppose, but he wouldn't have had to rush had he stopped by the rest of the time we were waiting.  Went with lighter fare, but saw and sampled a few of other dishes around the table. Nothing was bad, but also nothing blew me away. Solid middle of the road across the board. All considered it is a place I wouldn't mind going back to if a friend picked it out, but doubt I'll be back on my own."}
{"text":"Awesome good food. Great flavor and very unique. Service wasn't great, but food made up for it."}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends, had the Brussels sprouts, broccoli soup, apocalypse burger and grits.  Service was impeccable, food was tasty, balanced, well made and presented.  Make an effort to visit, atmosphere was perfect wine and beer lists are long.  Pricing hits the spot too."}
{"text":"Me and Mr. T came here last night. We inadvertently made it in time for happy hour since our movie at Camelview was sold out. I was impressed they have happy hour on Saturdays, but the pricing was less so. A dollar off wine by the glass (5 to choose from), well drinks, sandwiches, and apps.  Nothing on their \"old school\" cocktail list called out to me (which is extremely unusual), so I got a greyhound. It was delicious with fresh-squeezed ruby red grapefruit. My husband went with their ultra smooth mai tai. I'm not sure if it was smooth because it was blended well or just light with the booze.  We got the $4 plate of pickles. I figured these had to be good given the name of the restaurant. There were several varieties on the plate including grapes (yum!), spicy dill, bread and butter, fennel, sunomono, and watermelon rind (the highlight of our entire meal).  The vegan burger had a nice flavor, but it fell apart with the first bite and continued to do so as I ate it. The burger chunks were good with the dump truck salad though. Perhaps P&P needs to bite the bullet and just do this as a vegetarian burger with eggs added so that it binds properly. My husband thought his beef sandwich was just ok. I tried not to steal too many fries off his plate. Those were delicious and definitely not frozen.  Overall, it was an all right experience. We wouldn't come back here on our own, but we wouldn't say no if someone suggested P&P either."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I was with a large group, so that might have been that. I was late and everyone else had already ordered. The server acknowledged me as the straggler or so I thought. I asked for a drink menu and a regular menu and he gave me the drink menu and he came back to the other end of the table a couple times leaving me still drink-less. After that he didn't ask about food and one of the guys in my party went up to him to tell him I was still looking to order. Everyone else received their food before I even ordered. I should have just given up right there, but I was starving. I ordered the apocalypse sow with salad. Not as good as I expected. I felt it was dry and lacking flavor. The aoli was just plopped in the middle. The meat was crumbling and I had to just eat it with a knife and fork. Should have just got the soup."}
{"text":"Dined here Tuesday night with my team after work (roughly 10pm) and the team along with myself found this place to be excellent in all aspects! Although it was late (usually servers are in a hurry to get you up and out) the server was very friendly and accommodating, I wish I could remember his name so I could give him the credit. They have an extensive reverse happy hour menu which is great for late workers and have great cocktails. I got two dishes. The fried Brussels sprouts which were amazing with pork belly added and I also got the duck fat fries which I wasn't to crazy about but, all my friends food was great. In conclusion  Service - 5/5 Food- 4.5/5 Value- 5/5"}
{"text":"Stopped in during a visit to Phoenix area.  The entrees were a bit mixed, we had the grilled bavette and the Cuban pickle crisis.  The steak was fantastic and would recommend.  The Cuban was good if your in the mood but not great. For drinks the beer selection looked good, my fiance had wine which was pretty bad and didn't end up drinking more than a sip.  The service was great, they were very friendly which was great.  They actually had a band in playing while we are and they were fantastic which made for a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing flavor. Amazing food. Amazing service. Had the trout and it was so buttery. My husband had the shrimp and grits. He said it was outstanding. The owner turned us on to a sampling of the house made bread and they were outstanding, packed with favor - especially when topped with the bacon jam or the salted butter- YUM! We split a bowl of their scrumptious soup. It was delicious. Also tried the beet salad and were surprised by all the flavor. We will come back. A must try!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm from California and have never been here before. I love the concept, and how fresh everything was. We got there and it was happy hour and yes, it made me very happy. I would like to come back and try the dinner menu. Till next time when we come back to AZ! Our sever was super cool. She took her time and explain the menu items. She had a great personality too. Everything we got was delicious! My favorite was the dump trunk salad"}
{"text":"My friend and I were pretty disappointed. Everything sounded so great and unique, but my mussels with chorizo just tasted burnt...I'm not even sure how you would burn something like that, but I digress. I can't even remember what my friend ordered, but again, it was something that appealed to our foodie sense on paper, but was nothing too special in actuality. Too bad..."}
{"text":"Usually Yelp reviewers are pretty right on, but not in this case.  I give the one star for the nice waiter.  The food was awful and over priced.  The cod bites appetizer had 4 small (half dollar size) pieces of fish with about 20 soggy french fries.  The pork pot roast sammy had a nice burnt roll, that actually cut the roof of my mouth.  Very little meat in the sandwich and half of it was un-chewable fat.  The flavor of the inside onion, cheese and butter was good.  I ordered the tots for an additional $1.00 and you only get two small potato creations.  These were decent but not great.  I was surprised that the waiter did not mention anything when he took my plate with a pile of chewed up fat on it.  I think he sees the writing on the wall and didn't really give a hoot.  I would suggest he starts looking for a new job.  This place has been open for three weeks and I am positive that most of these reviews have been made by friends or family members.  I have lived in Scottsdale for over 40 years and have seen many places come and go.  This place will go."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed the Charcuterie Plate and the house made pickles. Pork Tostadas were delish.  Props to the bar: These folks = extraordinary cocktail crafters.  Thanks for serving Hendricks with the appropriate garnish!  :-))"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service. The cuban pickle crisis sandwich is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is SO good. Came in with my family of 6 and sat near the bar. Server was a gentlemen with flawless silver locks and was absolutely stellar. (used to manage a restaurant so I know good service) all food and drink tasted delish. Props to Skot the bartender and props to the kitchen for speedy and perfectly executed bills. NEW FAV OF SCOTSDALE!"}
{"text":"This is the hardest thing for me to do, but I have integrity and I believe it is in public interest to document when you have an issue with food at a restaurant; people deserve honest reviews.  I had a couple shards of hard plastic in my Pig and Pickle Eggs Benedict.  These shards were hard enough to cause some serious damage if swallowed, so I'm glad that I am a good chewer.  Although the service was stellar and the food tasted great up until that point, I'm sad that employees did not recognize and then throw away batches of food that might have been contaminated by a broken holding container.    I feel like two-stars is enough to document that this occurred for future visitors.  I was compensated for my meal and I was happy with how this was dealt with, but I can never return."}
{"text":"Went in to Pig and Pickle on a Monday with a grip of chefs and foodies around 11 to find more than 20 or 30 people all looking to be enjoying themselves at this sparsely decorated gem in a strip mall.  The dining room is decorated with a giant wall of the silhouette of a pig and the rest of the room with local artwork, including a gangster Marilyn Monroe, I'm a fan. The drinks list included small batch boozes along with great beers by the bottle and tap.   On to the best part of the place, of course, the food.  We all ordered different things to share and get a full experience of their late night menu.  Different than their regular hours menu of course.  I got the pork tostadas with kim chee and the pickles plate.  Both were delicious and the kim chee actually had a little funk to it that I appreciate.  The pickles were great too and a  good assortment with grapes being the star along with green beans, fennel, beets, and onions.  My friends got the burger which was juicy and cooked perfectly on a flatbread that fell apart a little bit.  We also all tried the Tot of the day which was prosciutto and some sort of cheese that I forget, also tasty.  Possibly the best tot I've had.  We also tried the croque madam which was executed well with creamy mornay and perfect runny eggs but the star of the night was the braised pork leg which anyone there late night must have.  Perfectly tender with a crispy sear and delicious braised butter beans with tomatoes.   Pig and Pickle is worth every penny and I will sure be back for my late night after work cravings for local goodness.  Oh did I mention 2.50 tall boy PBRs and coozies lol."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food because right before we were about to order the waitress let us know that 4 out of the 9 items on the menu they were out of, so we decided to go elsewhere. Drinks were good. But we won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre food, extremely slow service. Good atmosphere and good potential but was disappointed. Could've been an off night."}
{"text":"Great wine by the glass choices. I had the bone marrow appetizer and it was my favorite taste of the night: rich, smooth, and the pickled grapes were a perfect pairing. The entrees were a little disappointing. I tried the porchetta and the duck. The porchetta was way overcooked and dry and the gnocchi that accompanied it was burnt on one side and raw on the other. The orange sauce on the duck was too sweet for me and the duck itself was a little chewy. I would've loved a crispy skin on the bird as well."}
{"text":"The pricing for this establishment is a little steep.  But where they earn my praise is this is one of the few artisan establishments which allows dogs on the patio.  The cuisine is always top notch, and the patio can make a relaxing experience watching the streetscape on Thomas Road.  The music is a little rough, but the place is clean and the ambience is there."}
{"text":"It's always a bummer to see a spot you enjoyed in the past- slide downhill in such palpable fashion.   I used to come here for brunch and happy hour. When a friend I haven't seen in a long time suggested getting drinks- I said let's hit P&P.   Got there a bit after 4 and the place was empty except for one high top.  I found my friend and joined her. It took a looong time to have anyone check on our table, which is odd since it was dead. I tried to order a drink off the happy hour menu but they were missing an ingredient.  I was surprised there was no offer to substitute something else or offer an alternative. Instead I said I guess I needed more time. My friend suggested I just get that drink minus one ingredient, since it would likely taste good anyway. When the server came back I asked to do that, and she seemed totally flummoxed and said she didn't know if they could do that- but she would check with the bar. Five minutes later my drink shows up and miraculously the missing ingredient is now back in stock.   For food we ordered pork tacos and an order of Mac and cheese. Both items were $5 on happy hour; and the server asked if we wanted to add pork belly into the Mac and cheese. I assumed it would be an extra buck, or maybe a little more- but I had to laugh when the bill arrived and it was an extra $4 for some bubble gum-like pork belly. The add-on costs nearly the full price as the dish its supposed to enhance.   The tacos were TINY. If you've ever seen the YouTube videos of the hamsters eating tiny food- then you've seen  this food.  I understand it's a happy hour small plate situation- but it was still pretty weak.  The Mac and cheese was abysmal. It looked like Mac and cheese but had no discernible flavor of any kind. It was so odd. The dish desperately needed salt, as it was so so so bland. Sadly the table also needed salt but there was none, and our server was no where to be found.   Another odd thing that killed the ambiance, as there were two streams of music. The overhead music and then the kitchen was blasting death metal, at an oddly high volume. I love music and like to hear it everywhere- but when it is blasting into a dining area, that's just unprofessional  and basically sends and overall message of apathy- which makes sense when you take into account the poor service, tasteless food, and garbage drinks.   I don't know what the hell happened to this once great place- but if I were the owners I would be pretty nervous about my future. I wish this place all the best- but they gotta get this figured out."}
{"text":"Like a lot of people have already said,  if you aren't ordering the pork shoulder tostadas, you're doing it wrong.  It's an amazing and unique appetizer.  The rest of the menu is also excellent (such as the pork shank). It's worth the slightly higher price."}
{"text":"Holy wow! This restaurant is just a couple miles from my house, but I avoided it thinking it was some \"hipster, fruiffy food\" joint. Well, it kind of is, LOL. But SO delicious! From the decor to the food to the staff, everything about this place has made me a regular customer. Not somewhere you want to go if you're super-picky (you know who you are, \"I wanna substitute everything\" folks), but if you've got working taste buds, you are in for a treat. I had the Apocalypse Sow burger..... *drool* The french fries are some of the best I've had. My 2 year old loved the grilled cheese sandwich and (aside from the lack of a changing table in the bathroom), it was super family-friendly. They've got a bar set off to the side with two flatscreens to watch the games, and their drink menu is twice the size of their dinner menu, haha. Add a sweet side patio for outdoor dining, and it couldn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"The menu is a little different than your typical BBQ place. I might even call it eclectic. There were only a couple of things I would try. Most of the other choices had ingredients I don't care for.  Went there for lunch. I had the Cuban sandwich my wife had the Croque madame. They were very good although the Ciabatta bread on the Cuban didn't hold up the the sandwich. It fell apart. They do give you a good sized portion. I think prices could be lowered and portion sizes reduced as neither one of us could finish our meal.  The service was not very good. Waited a long time for the waiter to come by, he only came by one time during our meal, we could have used refills on our drinks. We were finished and waited a long time for him to get our check. Another table had the same experience with the same waiter. Unfortunately, he was the only server working at this time. There were only 4 tables for him to cover.  We won't go back as there is just not enough on the menu I like."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Pork leg, tots, beers, food.  Good.  Now go eat."}
{"text":"Stopped here simply because we liked the name. Will return because the food is PHENOMENAL!  We had the Cuban and the Apocalypse Sow. Delicious, divine, simply the yummiest \"sammies\" I think I've ever had. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The Brussels sprouts, beat salad, tostada appetizer and the pork shank are delicious. The service is probably one of the worst. The Foie Gras was so salty that it was like eating salt packed sardines that weren't rinsed - sad because it was excellent last week. The tater tots were basically like round croquettes with no filling (they were supposed to be filled with ham and cheese), and we were told that they would be exploding with goodness... They were like deep fried mashed potatoes. The Dump Truck salad, and, as I mentioned before, the beat salad were my favorites. I will come back again for sure but will not anticipate great service."}
{"text":"This place quickly became my fav neighborhood restaurant and bar. They have a great selection of craft beers!  The food is unique and very tasty.  The burgers are big and the fries are seasoned  nicely.  The service is very fast and friendly.  The decor I love: very industrial with cool local art and wood accent walls.   If you want a cool restaurant and bar you gotta check out the pig!"}
{"text":"Just driving by this place makes my mouth water! I don't know if the air around Pig & Pickle actually smells like bacon or if it's just my imagination getting the best of me.  Service was friendly and prompt. I had the porchetta which was absolutely amazing. Each bite had a slightly different taste and texture. The inner portion was a little bit spicy and the outer portion was like bacon--but better (how is that possible?). I also had the pork tacos with kimchi and they were great! Tender, shredded pork with kimchi on top. The kimchi wasn't at all overwhelming.  And for dessert--the nutella ice cream. This is a game changer for me! I don't usually order dessert because I always overdo it during dinner, but thankfully my date insisted. It was delicious and I found myself continuing to dream about that ice cream and figure out when I can have it again. I can't wait to go back to Pig & Pickle--my new goal might be to try everything on their menu!"}
{"text":"My first 5 star review and you'll see why  Fiancée and I wanted to try this as I'm all about what you can do with meat.  Grabbed a seat at the bar and immediately had a menu and two waters.  Bartender help my girl out with her mixed drink which was a ginger tequila.  Not a tequila guy but darn did that taste great.  Bartender definitely took his time making it and could tell he cared how everything was.  Now of course I went for the apocalypse \"sow\" which made this a 5 star review.  Very tender pork burger, homemade aioli and of course bacon and cheese.  Not much else but not much else was needed.  The spices and tenderness said it all.  Served with a side of homemade fries that were perfect.  Fiancé had the shrimp and grits.  She loved it, Looked awesome, ample size but I was so focused on my burger I was full by the time I thought about a bite.    Will I be back? You bet....Will I be back this week?  You bet!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Charcuterie platter is always worth it, great place to hang with friends and of course my mom!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and this time the whole restaurant was redone and I REALLY love how they've redecorated! It's got a very cool, welcoming vibe and I will definitely return.  There are a couple of reasons I didn't 5-star this beauty. One: slow bartenders who don't greet you at all. You just sit there like an idiot until you're so dehydrated you ask for something to quench your thirst. NO BUENO. Socializing with everyone while a customer waiting for a drink is just bad form. Two: very, and I mean very, limited vegetarian menu. And while I get that 'pig' is in the name, not everyone participates in the eating of your cloven hoofed animal. So please expand that, it would be so awesome.  So, to get down to it. I sat at the bar and once I finally got my drink everything moved pretty smoothly. Good beer selection, by the way. Not original, but no Coors Light here so I consider it a good selection. I ordered some delicious fried Brussels sprouts with asiago & a farm fresh egg and let me tell you, that was probably the best I've ever eaten. I have no idea where my aversion to BR's came from. Probably because my mom didn't do them P&P style. DO NOT MISS THESE.   For dinner I had ratatouille with a blob of goat cheese in the middle. Not a great taste at all. I wouldn't have even ordered it had there been a bigger variety of veggie dishes to choose from and you can sure bet I won't order it again. It was odd. I don't even know who made this dish up, blech. At any rate it was P&P so they did make it better than any other place I've eaten it (the very few times I have) so there's that. Their menu changes often so hopefully they'll incorporate better selections.  All in all it's got a great vibe and for you meat eaters this place will seem like culinary heaven. It's a definite keeper for the ambiance alone!"}
{"text":"So far so good. We went for happy hour & ordered almost everything on HH menu except for brussels sprouts & only because we were full from the other four things we ordered already. Very different & very delicious! We did find multiple items to be slightly over-salted but it did not take away from the dish. We can't wait to return to try other menu items. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the BLT is the best sandwich I have ever had. Period.   A true gastronomical experience."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is amazing. I don't know how long i have had this place bookmarked to try but i am so happy to finally eat here. Great happy hour food and drinks. We got the crispy skin brown butter trout which was so tasty! The smoked pot roast sammie was ginormous and incredible, especially when paired with tots and a fresh pickle. Yum. Our waitress was also phenomenal, she gave great recommendations and was on the ball the entire time."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been here and it's so close to my house! This place is fantastic. Came for happy hour and at first was disappointed that the food was so limited for HH, BUT they did not disappoint. The food is delicious and they definitely specialize in making drinks. Our server Ricky was incredibly courteous and attentive. I will be back to check out their dinner menu very soon!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE! I run a local restaurant, and on principle I have never yelped before. I sat at the bar, I had the foie...I downloaded the app and yelped.  Their hospitality is AMAZING. I cannot say enough about the culture in this restaurant.  The food is OUT OF CONTROL! Thoughtful menu with amazing choices that the foodiest foodie and the pickiest eater will love.  The bartenders are so humble and so accommodating. I cannot say enough!   Love. Just. Love."}
{"text":"I've never had a service as bad as this one. It's a shame because we've read all these great reviews and our whole party agreed that this was the worst experience we've ever had. (only giving 1 star because it won't allow me to post without one)   I'm a server, so I first hand understand and know how it is when dealing with parties of 5 or more people BUT the way we were treated and taken care of was not okay.   First off, our server Anthony was rude and paid no attention to any of us AND it wasn't even busy. A couple of people on our table didn't get water for 20 min because he was no where to be found. It took about 30 min before we could place an order. And his responses were short and rude. Everything was \" yeah it says it right there\" or \" um yeah\" or \" um no.\" I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure the sass isn't necessary when guests are asking a simple question. One of our friends asked for a side of ketchup two times and never even got it.  Second, our food was luke warm and my friends burger was under cooked.   When we asked for our bill we realized we all had gratuity already added to it and we asked our server about the gratuity, he gave us a sassy/rude response saying it's automatically on there. Which is fine, but again the attitude was not necessary.    Then Anthony came by faster then ever to pick up the checks that were signed. After he came to pick up the checks he was circling the table and noticed someone in our party writing a review. Anthony came up to our table and asked if there was any issues and then dropped a card with a managers name and number on it then continues to say that if we have problems to call the number. What was really upsetting was after giving us the card Anthony felt the need to come up and confront the guest he saw writing a review and said \"I'll be seeing if you have issues on Yelp tomorrow\" ( very rude and sassy AGAIN) AND he took the card with the managers number on it away from our table.   Him confronting someone in our party about a review is not only unprofessional and inappropriate but also none of his business."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is bomb (Brussel sprouts, pork belly, tater tots, jam and toast to name a few). Love the salty dog cocktail. And the atmosphere is great, particularly when Austin Carthell is playing."}
{"text":"Yes. You should go!!  We were visiting from out of town & found this gem on yelp. Easy relaxed place with great food! This is an overdue review from 5 mo ago. But I remember the food ..& this place is great! The server was great, in the midst of our convo...you could tell he enjoyed who he worked for,  & knew the food! We chatted a lot about the food. I can't recall what we exactly  ordereded..but. We had the bone marrow appetizer. It tasted  like bone marrow.  We had a pork roll swhich on the  house made bread roll. Everything about it was soooo good with the balanced slather of mustard &  house made pickles...& the pork juices.  Nomnomnom. I had the mussels..in a white wine broth with house made chorizo! Oh the best chorizo we both ever had! Delicious paired with the mussels & my crusty bread to dip in all the lovely juices of the them both swimming together in my bowl. To top it off..the desert. Oh so memorable... the toasted butter browned carrot cake with fried sweet yam shavings , carmalized pecans, with a black pepper berry drizzled over it & yes..  a whipped cream goat cheese! Oh what a way to end a fabulous meal. Hubby & I absolutely loved that dessert..the food, the service. We again wish this establishment was in our state & near our neighborhood so we could support it... awwww. Shame it is hundreds of miles away."}
{"text":"Great food cooked with an eye for detail and flavor. My husband and I came here on a Friday for lunch. There were very few dining at that time, I'm told all the craze happens at night and for good reason, the place is hip and has a great atmosphere. That being said, people are missing out on their fantastic lunch menu. The bar selections are unique and there are a great many to choose from. We ordered the fried brussel sprouts and pork shoulder tostadas to start. They were both Delicious. We then went on to order the udon noodles and grilled hanger steak for our main dishes. Again, both were delicious! The steak was very juicy and full of flavor! The udon noodle dish was sweet, spicy, nutty and covered with a great assortment of fresh vegetables.  Great service, great food, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, fun beer selection, and lots of random tasty pickled stuff.  Very unique place, and a new favorite!"}
{"text":"okay...I'm still laughing at Rachel R.s review...it's called PIG and Pickle not Pickle and Pickle...what were you thinking?  anyway...  took wife and kids there after a day  in Sedona...  the Charcuterie (sp?) platter pickled eggs YEAH BABY!!!  pickled grapes nice....everything on that plate was amazing...steamed clams with chorizo in the sauce....whoa....yummy...the Pork Belly was the most amazing delightful bad thing to eat...I need another please....and even the Friday Fish Fry was good...but the dipping sauce e they brought with it made it taste completely amazing....service... well Christina was awesome....I mentioned the Cole slaw was bland but only in contrast to everything else...she had the chef spice it  up for me.......great service...."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places to visit, when I visit the area. I've been here several times and have yet to be disappointed.  A few of my repetitive favorites include the golden beet salad topped with pork belly, bone marrow, charcuterie board, pork belly appetizer, pork belly entree, foie gras, the Brussels sprouts with a fried egg and pork belly....and, wait, did I say pork belly? The meats and pickled foods on the charcuterie board are made in-house, as well as the breads.   The menu changes seasonally, so I can't wait to see what will appear next!  They also have a nice selection of craft drinks and beer to choose from. I usually go for something local and/or of the IPA variety.   The staff is friendly and efficient. I thought the price for every meal eaten here was reasonable. As far as gastropubs go, Pig & Pickle is my #1."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We had alot of differnt drinks all of them were excellent. We had the tacos and tots both so good. The tots are to die for. They for sure are a must."}
{"text":"I love the Pig & Pickle... I ride my bike here sometimes and have dinner. Tonight I just popped in after a movie and I'm going to enjoy a salad and a side of slow roasted pork from their late night munchies menu! The food here is really delish, in fact the food is exceptional! It's a fun little bar too and the atmosphere is casual and urban. Oh, there is also a small patio for your pleasure when the weather is nice!   Oh, I need to mention the desserts, which are very special!  Ok, the cocktails, crafted cocktails with tinctures and all that!"}
{"text":"Awesome Awesome Awesome. Steak and eggs are great. and 5 dollars for a bloody mary and beer back. ill be back."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! The drinks there are truly hand crafted and the food is delicious!  Don't miss out on the taters tots.  @ only1$ a piece and ala carte, I suggest getting a plate of a least 10, you won't be disappointed.   Nice and clean atmosphere and sometimes chill live music.  Wish I lived closer, I'd be here every night."}
{"text":"Had the Cuban with Small Dump Truck Salad.  Both are tasty but having lived in Florida I wish the rest of the country could just make the sandwich the way it is meant to be made - simple, flattened, Cuban bread.  Sandwich was generous and tasty but it didn't taste like a Cuban.  If anyone can tell me where to get a true Cuban sandwich in the metro, thanks in advance.  Great service.  Price point a little rich for the location and lunch."}
{"text":"If there was an option to give 10 stars, I would. This place is AMAZING!!!! My husband and I have been here twice despite the fact we live in Tucson. This is a true Gastropub in the best sense of that world. \"Gastro\" meaning culinary delights await you, complex but familiar flavors, excellent pairings, innovative interpretations. \"Pub\" meaning the vibe is casual and welcoming while still being nice enough you can bring a date here. Both times we went there has been live music, which was fantastic. Not so loud you couldn't talk, but definitely added to the groovy atmosphere. Now to specifics on food. Order the small plates and order a lot of them. We haven't had a bad one yet. Particular favorites are the bone marrow (unctuous and decadent), pork shoulder tostadas (SO FLAVORFUL!), and fried brussel sprouts (add a second egg, totally worth it). Everything executed flawlessly, flavors spot on. If you're a fan of cider, I highly recommend ordering the Finnriver Habanero Cider. Lots of other creative drink options too. One of our favorite restaurants ever."}
{"text":"The rotating tab has put this place on my rotating list of places to go with good beer. Music is chill, older hip hop. Bartenders are good. Beers great. Haven't tried food but I like the vibe"}
{"text":"This is the best place in old town that nobody (at least not enough) know about.  I have never had a bad meal there and each time I try something new on the menu it is amazing.  They know what they are doing over here.  Great drink menu and selection.  They continue to do new creative stuff.  If you are tired of the same old stuff that every other place has this is your spot. It feels like home but better!"}
{"text":"Food is good. I had the chicharrones for an app and these things are absolutely delicious. They come out cracking and perfectly salty and so so good. I'm craving them as I type this. Go at happy hour and order some with your drink. The bartender was wonderful and helpful as I picked out my selection. Will come back when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"To be fair, this is review a month or so overdue. Was not a fan. The concept and menu seemed great so we thought we'd try it. Went with two other couples. Our waiter was impatient and rather intolerant to the fact that we were translating for our friends visiting from another country. Considering they weren't that busy on the night we went, I was completely put off by the behavior.   The food, which we thought would be flavorful, was outright bland. Considering that the majority of the reviews for this place are great, this was thoroughly disappointing. The great smell from the meat in the kitchen did not match what I tasted in the apps nor the entrees.   I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing barrel-aged cocktail here, along with a creative and flavorful meal- the pickle platter was the perfect appetizer for our sandwiches, and the fries were seriously the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot but I've only been here twice. The food was great and the bartenders know how to poor a proper cocktail. I need to go back more often, but this place is high on my recommendation list for a good place to go."}
{"text":"Enthusiastic foodie restaurant.  I love going to restaurants run by young foodies because they take chances and are unafraid to make mistakes.  This place makes mistakes, some of the food combinations simply do not work, but those that do are super.    Good portions and options.  The pork shoulder tostadas and the meat and cheese platters were the highlights.  As was the creative mixed drinks."}
{"text":"I have been four times since my original 4 star review.  This is now my go to spot to bring visitors from out of town.  Still, the strip mall appearence on the outside is the only distraction.  Once you go through the doors, it is a culinary explosion in your mouth.    Great food, well thought out.  I am big fan of pigs and pickles and they do not fail to deliver here.  I have even been for a beer 4 course meal that was fun and adventerous.  I am heading there tonight to take my mother for her fiirst stop.  TIP - leave room for dessert, they have some wonderful creations."}
{"text":"My parents took me out for my birthday and chose Pig & Pickle. We started off with some drinks, my dad had Moose Drool, my mom and husband Pale Ale, and I went for the tropical itch. My drink was similar to a Mai Tai, a little bit fruitier, with a generous amount of rum. Very good for a hot night.  We ate the following: Charcuterie plate - a large mix of meats, lots of salami, and pickled goods, it event included pickled grapes, very interesting! Beer Cheese Soup - so rich and flavorful, the cheddar really popped and the chunks of crispy bacon really added to the dish, I think this is the best cheddar ale soup I've ever had Bone Marrow - I had never eaten this before, it was fantastic here, we spread it on pretzel bread with bacon jam Lobster roll - nice serving of lobster, with homemade chips on the side Mussels - this came with a wonderful wine sauce and chorizo Duck - fell right off the bone, served over a perfectly cooked risotto Seared Carrot Cake - worth coming here just for this, the most creative carrot cake I've ever had. It was a seared block of cake, topped with goat cheese frosting, candied fried carrots, and pistachios and raisins. A must try!  Our server was fantastic, she had a great personality and was really on point with recommendations. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm still dreaming of the Waffle with the maple glazed brisket and two sunny side eggs. Yum! I had my waffle with the crispy bacon mixed in, and OH MY FEISTY YUM!! Yes, get it with bacon, it makes it that much better, and scrumptious! Service was on point, water was always refilled and I'm coming back for the mussels and creme fraiche plus more good eats!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for lunch, first timers.   IT WAS AMAZING!!  I got the Cuban and a salad (the salad was a Very generous size and super fresh, I'm big on side salads and this was a great big delicious one!)  I don't usually tend to like Cubans, but it sounded different so I gave it a shot. Hands down the most delicious thing ever. The mustard is SOO sweet and tangy it played on to the flavors of the meats and pickles so well.   My boyfriend got the pork burger, and tots (BBQ chicken stuffed) and omg! The tots were fantastic!   Great beer selection.   Truly LOVED this place, cannot wait to come back for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly.  Bartender is awesome.  Skip the udon noodles however.  It was borderline inedible because it was drenched in mae ploy.  I heard the other dishes are amaze balls so will def come back and try something else."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I come here. It is laid back here with pheonaminal food. I come here for the porkbelly sandwich and beer among other great things. The vibe is eclectic and the menu is great. I've been here mid day, dinner time, and late at night. I've never had to wait too long to get greeted and seated. I also have common sense and understand that if it's a Friday night, they are going to busy so it might take a minute like any other place on the weekends.   Food and service; I've never had a problem. The waiter even took something off my bill because he realized I only took 1 bite from it. He asked if I liked it and my response was \"it's not my favorite, the rest is great\". On a friday, that is amazing service. Most waiters/waitresses I've had never pick up on that and never go above and beyond like that hence why this gets a 5 stars for detail oriented service. I didn't even expect him to notice. They have great craft beers and the waiters know what to recommend.   Reminder, this is a gastropub. If you are expecting something super fancy and stiff, this isn't it. Go somewhere else. This is a good place where you can kick back and get together with your friends and have a good time with better food. A gem that reminds me of many bars and gastropubs I've missed since I've moved from Washington."}
{"text":"I really really recommend this place! I took a friend from out of town here, and since then have gone back quite a few times.   First, the design of the restaurant really works for them. I feel like so many restaurants are attempting to go for that, \"simple industrial,\" look these days and Pig & Pickle has really pulled it off well. They've created such a cool and trendy atmosphere with a menu that goes along with it.   There are so many unique foods to choose from on the menu and from my understanding, the menu changes frequently (which I love, personally). If it's available during the time you're there, I definitely recommend the udon noodles, bone marrow, foie gras, and roasted corn. Share amongst your table! The portions aren't big, but they're packed with flavor! (And definitely balanced, like the mission statement claims.)   Their drink menu is a total win too! I've never ordered anything I didn't like. For those that don't/can't drink alcohol, THEY HAVE COCA LIGHT. OMG LIKE WHAT?!?! and an array of really great soda pops. For those that choose an alcoholic beverage, their menu is endless and amazing! #scottsdaleproblems is my go to, but you really can't go wrong with any of the drinks they offer!   As far a price point, a little pricey, but definitely a stand out in the sea of Scottsdale restaurants! Go here!"}
{"text":"Food was 4 stars great.  Marrow bones and pork porchetta were excellent.  I love the menu and unique food options.  They even sell a few of my favorite cookbooks here.  I want to go back when they have head cheese on the menu.  I give it 3 stars because the location, interior, and service are not anything special."}
{"text":"Great place with the best pork shoulder tostadas in town which is served with ginger aioli, kimchi, scallions. Usually just come here for the drinks and but the food lunch and dinner menu is awesome. They change it often and serving size is generous. The drink menu is full of craft cocktails and lots of beer choices. Kitchen is open late!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food; 1 star for the service.   We went on a Tuesday but it was obvious they were having problems with the kitchen and wait staff.   I over heard multiple other parties getting the wrong food and/or not getting service.   I ordered the salmon but they brought me a steak.  I ate it because I was worried I'd be there all night waiting for the correct food.  I'm glad I did because it was ones of the best steaks I've ever had.   The sauce was spectacular with walnuts and dried cherries. Overall I hope they get their service issues fixed because the food was wonderful."}
{"text":"It wasn't the food selection for me. Very little to choose from on menu even when it came to big.... I wasn't a fan of \"A giant piece of bacon.\" The girl and I will not go back because of the menu selection. I don't mind pig but the menu didn't offer much to my girl's or my tastes.  PRO: Has Mercenary IPA and other great drinks to choose from!!!            Great Service and interesting atmosphere CON: Menu did not fit me even though I would eat a pig."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this spot! I've never been to a restaurant like this one. Any meal choice off of the menu has been a hit for me. So tasty! Your five star rating has been well deserved!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food!!! Try the tots.... We had chicken and green chilies.  Tostados are a must!!!! So good with the ginger! The appocolips sow burger was also good... A little salty but very good!!! We wanted to try dessert but couldn't because we were so full!!!"}
{"text":"Food: Very good. We had the duck and the fish fry. Both were excellent. We were sorta disappointed that we didn't get any of the house made bread. I guess we should have asked? Could be our faults so whatever.  Drinks: Eh...I've had better old fashioneds. Maybe I am just comparing it too much to Boston gastropubs which tend to have fantastic drinks. This is not to say it was bad, it was good...but I wasn't obsessed with it the way I am at some other places. On the other hand my dining companion's drink was good and I would be satisfied with it at virtually any location.  Service: The hosts were super friendly. Our server was nice, but very pushy and not super subtle in his attempts to upsell us. Why would you ask if I want fois gras or pork belly with my fish? Who puts foie gras on fish? We were also interrupted in the middle of our entree when we were halfway through it to so that he could start trying to sell us on dessert. Can we just have a conversation? I understand that restaurants need to upsell given that I was a server at one point, but good restaurants find ways to do it at the right time and in subtle ways. This was our only meal in the Phoenix area so I have no idea whether that was the norm (I am guessing it is not). I guess the point is, I am sure the service could easily be improved upon by giving people a little more space and not making recommendations that make no sense in terms of taste combinations for the purpose of having me spend more money.  Overall though, I would come back if I lived in the area. You may be asking how I came up with four stars here given the amount of criticism...my answer would be that the food quality to price ratio is great. The same entrees in most northeastern cities would be at least 5 or so dollars more."}
{"text":"I made a point of it to get to Pig & Pickle for a couple of reasons (besides their interesting looking menu).  For one, I was told this place was super popular for late night eats.  Secondly (and most importantly), this is supposedly a favorite spot for professional chefs when they want to dine out and unwind.  In fact owner and head chef Keenan Bosworth is a big favorite of the so-called \"Arizona Seven Chefs\" (a collective of AZ chefs that were recently picked to serve a meal at the famed James Beard House).  I love pork.  I like pickles.  I think I'm ready to do this, so vamonos!  You'll find this monument to swine on Thomas just west of Scottsdale Road on the north side of the street.  I'm not much of a late night owl, but I was intrigued enough that I arrived here for happy hour on a Tuesday.  Saddling up to the bar, I glanced around the room to see just how many paintings, statues, piggy banks and other pig themed memorabilia adorned the interior (I stopped counting at 15).  Even the air inside of this place smells like pork (not overpoweringly so, but enough that the theme sets in).  The interior seats probably 50-60 with what looks like another dozen or so seats on the back patio.   Swine rules much of the menu here, but amongst the pork items include much more complex dishes including bone marrow, shrimp and grits, liver pate, and fois gras.  Understanding that the late night menu was a big hit here, I did some homework in advance of my visit to try and pick late night menu items that would be available as dinner and happy hour options.  That way I could at least partly replicate their late night experience.  For starters, a little happy hour cocktail.  I choose the one they call \"#scottsdaleproblems\".  House made limoncello, bitters, lime zest, and prosecco.  Palette awoken, it was time for the food.  For my appetizer, I went with the Pork Shoulder Tostadas.  Pulled pork shoulder, kimchi, greens, and a ginger aioli.  GRAND. SLAM.  Let me first say the tostada shells were perfect, crunchy, and held up beautifully and kept my pork in place the whole time.  But that pork, aioli, and kimchi mix was absolutely out of this world.  You MUST try these if you're coming here for the first time.  For my main entree, I braced myself for Apocalypse Sow.  A ground pork (not beef) burger, topped with tons of bacon, white cheddar, aioli, and grilled onions.  I love pork, but even this was a beast for me.  Burger might've been a little too well done for my taste, but the bacon and aioli were excellent.  I should also mention I got the burger with a side of their Dump Truck Salad.  Mixed greens, various shaved veggies, cucumber, seeds, and a shallot vinaigrette.  A nice pleasant cleanser for my meat orgy.  For dessert, they were offering a peanut butter and caramel bread pudding, to which I politely said \"yes please\".  In addition to the PB and caramel, the bread pudding is topped with vanilla bean ice cream and powdered sugar.  Healthy portion (probably meant for two or more) and I liked the fact the bread pudding wasn't soggy.  The dessert didn't blow me away, but it was a pretty tasty ending to a fun dining adventure.  Total cost for the drink, food, tax, and tip came to about $50.  As I sit here writing this I'm still recovering from an epic case of the meat sweats (thanks to the combo of pork tostadas and a pork orgy of a burger), but glad I gave this place a try.  I will absolutely come back for the tostadas and if I do at some point need a late night fix in Scottsdale, Keenan's place will be one of the first places I look up.  With a laid back unpretentious vibe and slightly upscale mix of choices on their menu, I can completely understand why chefs and night owls would pick this place for a relaxed meal and beverage.  Pork fan or not, chances are you'll find at least one thing especially for you on the menu here.  Hell, I found four!"}
{"text":"I had to seriously debate on whether I should drop my review down to a 2, but I am going to give P & P a little lead way for still being new.  Mainly because I really want them to succeed, since they are just around the corner from our house.  Here are the 3 main reasons they have lost my love.    1. The removed my favorite dish and the only vegetarian starter on the menu  2. Their website and twitter handle both say Happy Hour until 7PM, but they decided to change it to 6 and will not honor what they've advertised. 3. Their pickles are disgusting   We still received great service, and my vegetarian Chile/Mash was pretty tasty, but I hate going to a restaurant where I don't have choices or the opportunity to experience a complete meal (Starter, Main Course, and dessert). The server mentioned that their menu keeps changing and it's hard for her to keep up, let alone the website... this is going to cause them major problems if they don't get their act together.  I was disspointed and live a mile away, imagine how upset someone will be who traveled a great distance based on the information they had listed on their website! Again, I hope they do well, but I won't be rushing back any time soon...."}
{"text":"food was excellent, good beer selection. what I really appreciated was the waiter telling us the tip was already included because we had a party of 6. Can`t tell you how many times I've double tipped."}
{"text":"The dump truck salad is one of the best salads I've ever had.  The margarita was THE BEST margarita I've ever had.  Both my dad and boyfriend enjoyed the Cuban Sandwich, although that sandwich is very big!  Sat outside and it was very nice.  Did have a strange waiter who shook our hands, but he was friendly and harmless.  Haha... I've just never experienced that before.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Very innovative menu with lots of great menu options.  I hear they have live music on Friday!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and always leave happy and full!  The drink menu is fantastic... a few of my favs are the red headed stepchild, stoney bah-loanie and pure vesper.  The food is always spot on...love the pork belly, nancy with pork belly, charcuterie, pork tostadas and ALWAYS try to the TOT of the day! I can't imagine ever having a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"Here ye here ye, this was my very first Arizona Restaurant Week experience, you can see my restaurant flower has been 'taken', or whatever other virgin-analogy you want to come up with. I was convinced I was going to miss the whole thing  (due to some excessive partying in Vegas) but upon arriving on Memorial Day, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that it ended that day, and quickly called to make a reservation.  Upon arriving at P&P I finally got why the lady on the phone was so chill about me picking a time and moving it later: the place was completely empty. I mean, it was us and the cooks, not a soul in the room. Since the Yelp reviews about this place were so fantastic, I decided to stick to my guns and ask for the Restaurant Week Menu and a bottle of Pinot Noir from Oregon which was pretty tasty. Here is what I ate:   BONE MARROW - 5 stars I've never had bone marrow so maybe I'm biased by raving about it so much. The texture was strange but super flavorful and I loved the options to pair it with picked onions, stewed cranberries or a sweet relish. Load all the flavors on toast and you got yourself a really interesting, tasty, full-bodied and complex appetizer. A great great start to a 3 course meal.  GNOCCI SALAD - 5 Star I couldn't really identify all the individual components in this dish but they all meshed into one fantastic plate of food. The mushrooms were well cooked, the sauce at the bottom was creamy, sweet and salty, the gnocci and onions were tender and packed with flavor and the leafy greens at the top off-set the flavor in the sauce for a full balanced thing. It could've worked as a salad  dish (instead of an appetizer) or even as a small main entree. Not super easy to share but why would you? Its too good to give up.  CESAR SALAD- 1 stars The salad category of this 3 course menu was definitely lacking. I wish I would've tried the soup instead. The Cesar Salad was covered with crumbs instead of croutons, the lettuce was soggy and drowning in the dressing AND the dressing itself (the only thing that requires work in this salad) was like a blast of anchovies. Too many anchovies. That's all I could taste, it felt like apple-bobbing in an ocean. Yuk. We tried a bite each and set it aside. It is now rotting in a box in my fridge.  DUMPTRUCK SALAD- 2 stars Really lame and inventive, the salad was essentially lettuce and slaw with carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes and 1 small piece of (what I think of) was beet hidden in the corner. The salad seemed wet enough to hit the presence of a dressing, but it had no flavor whatsoever. I took it home (didn't want to fill up on something not tasty) and struggled to eat it later. Womp Womp Womp  ROASTED DUCK- 5 stars One of the best duck dishes I have ever had, not that I eat duck very often. It was strange how I couldn't pick out a single item/ingredient on the plate (except the duck, I think I noticed that one) but they all worked together in a weird yet tasty combo. It seems the roasted duck was sitting on a bed of YAM (yes Yam) risotto-ish with a blueberry compote. It was sweet and salty and had lots of other flavors I couldn't describe. The duck was incredibly tender and fell off the bone. Despite being incredibly full, I licked (not literally, I have some table manners) clean, it was amazing.  PORK PORCHETTE- 3 stars The pork itself was 50% fat but the nonfat parks were tender and nicely cooked. The pork itself didn't have any seasoning or added flavor, so it was kinda mediocre. The medallion was sitting in a ginormous mount of (what I then discovered to be) potato salad. It was mostly potatoes, green onions and some coleslaw (I think). The whole thing was wrapped up in a sauce composed of horse radish and spicy mayo, two things I really really dislike. Unfortunately the menu wasn't super descriptive on this so I found myself eating the pork and not being able to take more than one bite of this nasty potato salad. That also went to waste. Boo.  Besides the food, our server was really awesome. Granted she had no other tables to serve, but she was still super nice to us and really easy to chat with. The place itself has upper-level food but the ambiance is very low-key, casual and cool to hang out in. If I were to come back, I'd be more careful with my menu picks, as it seems that a lot of its food (especially salads!) are hit or miss (or just miss). I'm glad I got to try it and would return only for the duck and maybe the gnocci salad.. everything else needs a revamp."}
{"text":"The place smelled great, but we'll never know how the food tastes because at 2:15 on a Saturday afternoon, they don't serve food. Despite the door sign and posted operating hours on Yelp being 10 am to 2 am, they stop serving food at 2 pm and open some time later for dinner.   The host seemed to not care that the hours aren't accurate."}
{"text":"I was really pleasantly surprised.  The food was excellent, the prices were reasonable.  I had kind of homemade orange whiskey martini that was fantastic.  The braised pork shoulder app and the croque madamme made it a wonderful dining experience.  Also given the location, you weren't fighting typical saturday night traffic.  I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Close to home but my real selling point is the dog friendly patio and homemade dog biscuits they bring out for the pups. Food is great, as is the service every time."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times since they opened and am more than satisfied with service and food every time! Their beers on tap rotate and their bartenders are happy to recommend one to compliment your meal.  The menu has some of my staple favorites, but also rotates with specials.  The burger is juicy on a toasted bread made in house. The vegan burger is just as hearty as the meat version, and since I'm not vegan I did add the bacon for \"$0\".  The croque madame is one of the best I've had due to fine selection of ham and gruyere cheese melted perfectly. For meat lovers, the braised pork leg fell off the bone, a rather large bone. Last, if you love seafood, please, please try the mussels with Spanish style chorizo.  I can't gush more without drooling.  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"My first visit was horrible. We sat at a table and had a server that, like other reviews, didn't want to wait on our table. He wasn't friendly and didn't know the menu very well. The whole experience seemed like we were not welcomed there. The noodle dish was large and good. The fondue was good, but not what we were expected. The sausage is cooked within the fondue and not something you dip into it. The Sow burger was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. Too much mayo based aoili. The second time we sat at the bar. They have some decent coctails, but a little over priced for what you get. After 2 cocktails for $20 I expect a buzz that didn't happen. Very weak pour. The bone marrow and pork belly were both excellent. The pork belly with pumpkin puree and pecans was amazing when you get a bite with all three at once. We would go back and sit in the bar area because of the food, but this isn't my first choice for drinks and the owners need to really re-evaluate their staff. They are all very off-putting."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Pig & Pickle and we will definitely be returning! Our server Science Rocket...was amazing and gave a couple of great recommendations.  I had the apocalypse sow and though it was monstrous in size it was one of the most delicious things I have ever had. We decided to try to the carrot cake as our dessert and once again all I can say is WOW. In addition to the impeccable service and food everything is made from scratch and locally grown if available.  It's rare to find such a refreshing restaurant and one that is reasonably priced at that! Definitely check it out if you are visiting the Scottsdale area or are a local that has been shy to try. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. The BLT is to die for. The B was thick slices of pork belly that simply melted in my mouth. It was a flavor explosion of the ultimate kind. I ordered the tater tots with my meal and dipped in the sauce that came with them was also an excellent experience. Wife had the Dump Truck salad and was impressed with that too. She also ordered a side of a bread plate and it came with 3 different spreads. All were delicious. They were smoked butter, bacon jam and apricot jam. Wife says \"all 3 spreads were fantastic\". She also liked the assortment of breads. One drawback is that it is a bit pricey. Just as an added note, the evening Menu is printed fresh every day at about 4PM (so I was told). The menu changes according to what he has fresh and available. Any Menus posted in here may not be the same when you get there. We got there at 3:30PM and got given the \"Happy Hour\" menu with drinks and a short list of \"appetizers\". So we ordered drinks, waited 30 minutes and got the freshly printed menus for that evening. then we pigged out !!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, atmosphere and staff. Get the pork shoulder tostadas and add a side of pork belly to anything! Brunches are phenomenal. Stoney Baloney cocktail is delicious, but I usually have Scotty the bartender pour me one of their draught ales or recommend something bottled."}
{"text":"Awful, AWFUL service: burgers were burnt, bread was dry, fries were trash, waiter was slow, and stupid expensive. I would've rather had a leftover quarter pounder. I made a yelp account just to write a review about this place. DO NOT GO THERE"}
{"text":"The crisp skin trout is to die for.  Sat on the patio and Eric was our server. Excellent service and food!"}
{"text":"This place is rad! Hidden away in an unassuming strip mall, i was SOOOO happy to find this gem.  All their food is made from scratch and local. The craft cocktails are some of the best I have had since I moved here and they have a revolving menu. I'll tell you what the pork belly, the tostadas, the chicharonnes- ALL amazing. The mac and cheese and the shishito peppers are mouthwatering too. The bartender was so knowledgable and crafted some amazing cocktails with house infused liquors and everything was amazingly priced. The happy hour is something not to miss,and I really cannot wait to go back. Would like to try the brunch soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night, we live nearby. Not sure we will go back. The food was pretty good, we had  the hangar steak, and believe or not, the cook actually knew what \"Medium Rare\" meant. They also have bottled Coke from Mexico. The good ends there. After a loooooong look at the menu and wait for the server, and choosing the fish and chips (it was friday, after all) the server asked, \"You came to pig and pickle for fish and chips?\"  WHAT?  It's on the menu, so I cannot have it? He was a bit overbearing on suggestions, suggesting the Duck or Pork.  There was also too much \"we serve locally sourced food, natural, blah blah blah. I'm all for supporting local farmers, and healthy ingredients, but we felt a little too \"schooled.\" When we both chose the steak, We sort of were made to feel as if we made a stupid choice. The steak was very good, the meat had good flavor, but the portion of the sides was a bit small. You are gonna need a starter or a salad to get enough food. The dessert menu was carrot cake, chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. Too much of that. we went to Dairy Queen for Ice Cream after that. The odd menu changes every night too.  The prices were OK, but mixed drinks were $7-$10 and just plain weird."}
{"text":"We are fans, regulars, and mildly obsessed with this place...We have tried almost everything on the menu, with fabulous additions and specials from time to time. The food is impeccable. High quality, fresh, and inventive and the prices are good. The location is great, the atmosphere is casual, staff is friendly and attentive. Late night dining is the best in town with a slightly abridged menu. Drinks are hand crafted, great beer and wines. From dining in to take out, we have never been dissapointed! AMAZING!"}
{"text":"First time at Pig and Pickle.  Arrived around 4:30 PM on a Saturday and there were only about a dozen there. There were a lot of sports events going on locally.   We were promptly seated by the overdressed hostess and offered menus and water. Thomas greeted us shortly after to offer drinks.   For food we got a charcuterie plate and a side salad to start.  Since it was happy hour, the salad was upgraded to a Dump Truck Salad. For the charcuterie meats it had: chorizo, salami, pork belly terrine, smoked salmon and tazzo ham. For pickled veggies: okra, green beans, pickles, grapes, onions and eggs.  It also had house made: mustard, bacon jam, sourdough bread (not very sour) , apricot spread and butter. The plate was outstanding, with kudos to the pork belly terrine plus the pickles.   For entrées, we ordered 'The Nancy', a cheddar bacon burger, a bowl of Mussels and the Shrimp and Grits. Everyone raved about their meal. For me, the shrimp were good, plus it had lots of chorizo slices and the grits were killer. Cheesy, thick, buttery, good spice and a flavorful broth. I'd order it again in a heartbeat. All in all, along with Thomas's excellent service, a perfect meal."}
{"text":"Top notch, best \"belly\" in town. Great bar & tenders. My favorite new spot. I was a little skeptical the first time I saw this spot, but have loved it every time I have eaten here."}
{"text":"Pig & Pickle is a gastropub that serves up small batch, barrel aged cocktails and all kinds of comfort food.   Pig & Pickle seemed like a sweet place to hang. There was a deconstructed bicycle hanging on the wall. Loud posters and art covered most surfaces. Pig & Pickle socks were for sale from the host. Some spring training hopefuls lounged in a corner, watching TV while enjoying a beer. That is to say, a group of very fit, similar height men that came off as aspiring professional athletes (aren't we all this way when we watch sports?) hung out at the corner tables.   The food, though, didn't reach the same level. The Brussels sprouts, though covered in tender egg yolk, was missing, at the very least, enough salt. The vegetarian pie, artfully inside a cut of squash, made my stomach ache. I don't have food allergies, so I wonder what went wrong inside my stomach. It was enjoyable to scrape the squash off and eat it with the pie's ingredients. I don't think America is in any rush to replace pie crust with squash, but I enjoyed what Pig & Pickle did.   I had tried to come once before, but that day there had been a gas leak and Pig & Pickle closed for the night. I'd come back with friends. Though there weren't many vegetarian options on the menu, I'd still visit again."}
{"text":"You can do no wrong here. Their pork belly is outrageous. Anything pork for that matter. The charcuterie plate is dinner in itself. Generous portions, appropriately priced, knowledgeable and friendly staff, unique cocktails. Everything is made in house and they support local farmers and businesses. Recommend it to everyone we know!"}
{"text":"This place has good food that is well prepared and artistic.  We came in for HH, the menu items are constantly being updated and rotating which I appreciated.  The chef cares about his food.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Some of the best homegrown food I've had in a long time with a very diverse menu and great beer and wine selection I would put six stars if I could"}
{"text":"Pig & Pickle --- simply fabulous! I enjoyed every moment with two good friends last night. We shared various items on the Happy Hour menu: Pork Shoulder Tostadas. 'dump truck' salad, Beer Cheese and Bread & the tasty Creamy Broccoli and Brown Ale Soup with Wisconsin Cheddar & Bacon. Great Food, Friends, Conversations & Laughs. I understand why Pig & Pickle was voted by readers in the New Times Best of Phoenix 2013 in the categories of Best Late Night Nosh & Best Happy Hour. Great staff as well. This will definitely be at the Top of my Favorites List. Cheers***"}
{"text":"I don't really understand what the hype is about.   1. The recommended pork belly tostadas were too salty, though its combination with kimchi was A+. 2. Bone marrow was worth a try because of how unique the flavors were. However, it too was unbearably salty.  I probably wouldn't come back a second time but it was an interesting experience."}
{"text":"The drinks are amazing, worth the trip alone. The food was a pretty eclectic mix of choices, Shrimp and Grits to the Cuban Sandwich. We had both, along with the Garbage Dump Salad and the Mac & Cheese. I would go back for all and several other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"P&P's rotating menu never disappoints. Their brunch is phenomenal & their bartenders are the best in the Phoenix valley."}
{"text":"This place is my jam. It's fantastic. Excellent cocktails awesome food. Ownership is amazing and the staff loves their jobs. It's at the top of my list for gastro pub dining in Phoenix. Get the five cheese plate and add foie gras, and the aper rye sour is out of this world!"}
{"text":"First un-satisfying meal I have had in Arizona.  It's a shame. I see the direction they are trying to do, which is ride the bacon craze and to be a bit tongue and cheek. It's a good effort but falls flat on execution.  First off our food took 30 minutes to arrive, not good for a lunch menu and especially for not being fully booked.  2nd the food was disappointingly salty.  Way too overtly salty, I had to drink several glasses of water to finish my burger and couldn't finish my soup (they took the soup off the order which was good)  3rd - our waitress gave us the incorrect price for a chicken addition (said 4 when it was actually 6).   The place would have been good if the food was a lot less salty, and they had more than two people on staff to serve the food.    Like I said, poor execution."}
{"text":"I like the concept a lot.  However, the food is just not right, or \"balanced\" as they say they're striving for.  My friend got a burger.  It was plain, no seasoning on the meat.  The best part was the pickle which ironically was closer to a type of kimchi than the kimchi that was supposed to be on my dish but back to that later.  The \"tots\" that we paid an extra dollar for was nasty.  Weird potato based hushpuppy.  It wasn't very good, wish we just stuck with fries.    I got the pork shoulder tostadas.  It could be pretty good, but the pork was just salty.  Not a lot of other flavor, just salty.  The kimchi was an attempt at the cheap chinese restaurant variation using regular cabbage but the seasoning was all wrong.  Just because you put some shredded cabbage with salt and red pepper, it doesn't make it kimchi.  There's a LOT of other ingredients!  The dessert was definitely the best part of the dinner.  Seared carrot cake.  The best thing I've had in a while actually.    So all in all, I'll go for dessert.  And maybe beers.  Also, they take a long time to get food out so don't go if you're on a time crunch.  Fortunately I wasn't, but I can see how this can be an unexpected problem.."}
{"text":"THESE GUYS CAN COOK!  Although they've been open just 3 months, this is already a wonderful restaurant. The food was terrific, the service very attentive, the staff well trained.   The 3 of us started with drinks at the bar: great service, the drinks are reasonably priced (not cheap, but reasonably priced) and a great selection of beers. Then, after a short wait, off to a table for dinner. We planned to have appetizers and entrees but we never got past the \"starters\", they were so good and sooo filling.  Started with the \"tots\" (outrageously good, light, crunchy, great texture; like pillowy latkes, but better). Then the broccoli soup: very tasty, good texture and, of course, lots of pig on top. Then the charcuterie: meats were delicious and the pickles were even better, especially those amazing grapes. The highlight, though, was the pork belly. Had two orders, it was that good.   Eagerly looking forward to the next visit to try even more of that wonderful menu. THEY SURE CAN COOK!"}
{"text":"I'll be very honest. This place is just down the street from me and very convenient. so I really want to like it. However, I just can't. I've sat at the bar several times, and the same douchey bartender is there. Lackluster service, weak and expensive drinks. No shits given about you, the customer. The food is pretty good. I really like the mussels. Most food items have some form of pork (hence the name) so be aware. There's no sense of community or anything on the menu that makes me want to return."}
{"text":"Happy hour provides nice value with filling, satisfying small plates: pork tostadas are incredible and have no comparison with a few of our fav Mexican eateries.   We are keeping our fingers crossed not to get the waiter again who is skimping on hair ties."}
{"text":"This place was not what we expected. It's not a BBQ joint but a hipster chichi restaurant. We were informed by our waiter that the chef cooks what he wants, how he wants and does not customize orders. This was in response to asking if there were any other salad dressing options other than shallot vinaigrette.  In other words, no, there are no other options. The pork burger is also filled with ground onions. Being a true onion hater, this was disappointing.   We both ended up sharing the Brussel sprout starter and each had a burger. I enjoyed the Brussels sprouts but my husband found them too dry. The unusual addition of egg on top helped with the dryness.   Both of our burgers came out overcooked to well done. The outside is a very crunchy charbroil. There wasn't much flavor but the quality of the meat was high. The burger as well as the meat were both dry and disappointing. My husband did not enjoy his shallot vinaigrette dressed salad, finding it too bitter for his preference. I had the fries which are cooked in vinegar. This added a nice flavor to them.   Unfortunately the menu was too limited for us. We recognized the quality of the food but the flavors just weren't there. Service was adequate, nothing more."}
{"text":"Holy pork. I'm laying here on the couch writing this review on my phone because I'm too full to move.   We are staying at a nearby hotel and wanted something good but take-out friendly. Looking at their menu and yelp reviews, I was reminded of the Salty Sow in Austin, one of our favorite places.   I ordered a couple of tots, the Apocalypse Sow burger, beef tongue Reuben. and seared carrot cake.   Tots and Reuben were excellent but the burger and carrot cake really stole the show because they were a notably different and superior version of something I've eaten a thousand times.    The ground pork of the Apocalypse Sow had a soft texture with a lot of flavor, and the bacon and caramelized onions worked well together.  Each ingredient was well executed, and even the accompanying pickle was delicious.  This carrot cake was actually pretty dark and thick, like a brownie consistency and not just your run-of-the-mill carrot cake slapped on a flat top.  I was hesitant to order it because of the whipped goat cheese (I usually don't like it), but the friendly and knowledgeable bartender talked me into it and I'm very glad I got it.  My favorite part of carrot cake is a real cream cheese frosting, and this did not disappoint in terms of creaminess or flavor. The candied carrots added a nice crunch factor.  We're already considering stopping by on the way to the airport tomorrow, if I'm able to eat again by then."}
{"text":"This is a place that does almost everything right.   I had an aper rye sour, the scallops and then the creme brulee.  Everything was awesome, drink menu is awesome, dinner menu is awesome.  Really friendly staff, too.  Not cheap, but really worth it."}
{"text":"Been here many many times. I feel like I am back in San Francisco where I are and lived for 10 years. Good food that is inventive and made with things that are available locally. The decor is very appropriate. The prices are very reasonable and they have an awesome happy hour!   My personal favorite dish... The duck. It is always cooked to perfection and the price any be beat.   This is a local neighborhood gem and I am so thankful I love right down the street."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here a few days go with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  We aren't the most adventurous foodies, but we decided to throw caution to the wind and give it a try.  After looking at their menu then thinking about the location of this place I was unsure what to expect.  You normally don't see this type fancy foodie cuisine in South Scottsdale and I was pleasantly surprised.  Almost everything I tried was very good.  The service was equally as good as our server was fast and friendly.  The prices, on the other hand, were a bit high I thought.  * Bread plate to start = very good.  The pretzel bread was awesome but so were the other few types of bread on there.  But WHY do they feel the need to charge $3 for it?  Having to pay for bread really pisses me off.  That is like paying to refill a soda. * Pork shoulder tostadas = very good * Iceberg wedge = very interesting and very good * Braised duck = tender, juicy, and very delicious. * Pretzel crusted red bird chicken = this was just ok.  It wasn't very flavorful and you really couldn't tell it was crusted with their homemade pretzel bread. * Stoney bah-loanie = very interesting but just ok - a bit too bitter for me * Moscow mule = pretty good but their homemade ginger beer made this one need to be sweeter  All-n-all this is a pretty decent place with great food.  The scene is a bit too foodie-hipsterish for me with all the farm-to-table bs, not having fountain drinks, charging for bread, etc.  However, I give this place a lot of credit for trying something new in an area that has seen nothing like it before."}
{"text":"Sadly My wife and I had very high expectations for the Pig & Pickle.   Having just landed in town for a weekend getaway we came here straight from the airport (based on a lot of positive reviews here).   I wanted a beer and good food after a long travel day.   I asked our server Jake if all the beers were served by the pint.   He replied yes and I ordered the stout.   He came back a few minutes later and informed me they were out and asked if I'd like to order something else.   I reviewed the menu and settled on the blueberry sour.   Jake returned with the beer in a snifter (probably 10-12 Oz).   I reminded Jake that he had told me a few minutes earlier that all beer on tap was served by the pint, and his response was rude at best.   He told me that the sour wasn't, and didn't offer me another option.   I protested, and he offered a pint of the beer I ordered.   What happened next was almost unbelievable...  He took my glass and returned with same beer I just ordered just poured in a pint glass (not topped off)!   What a joke.   Either he intentionally messed with me by retuning with a partially filled glass, or a manager told him to serve it to me that way.   This one star review is based on principle.   This is not how you treat customers.   You either give me a pint, offer an alternate, or at best just tell me you made a mistake and apologize.   I wish the food situation was better but it was it was over all pretty disappointing.   We started with the Dump Truck salad.   Not recommended.   Bland at best, with a non-existent dressing.  We followed with the Buffalo pork Shanks, which were served at a tepid temp.   I thought the taste was pretty good but it was clearly not cooked to order.   Lastly we finished with the Fried chicken pot pie.   It was really good, and could have raised this from a bad to mediocre review.   But the beer thing left such a bad taste in my mouth I can't provide a better rating, and would never recommend this place to anybody.   Sad."}
{"text":"This has become our goto spot for Sunday brunch. Be sure to sit on the patio on the nicer days. Trust us,  the traffic noise will disappear the further you get into the meal."}
{"text":"Funky place, food is fine.  I had the bone marrow and the BLT.  Both were good, nothing blew me away but it was a good meal."}
{"text":"We ordered the quesadilla, chicharrones. Buffalo pork shanks and the pork tostadas. The only item we really liked was the quesadilla but even that was not anything to remember. The other items minus the chicharrones were way too salty. i Didn't enjoy any of the food here and left feeling disappointed I was hoping we found a new late night spot. I was wrong. The reason I gave 3 stars instead of 2 (what the food deserved) was the waiter.  He was friendly and  attentive he  overall provided excellent service. Maybe we'll come back when they have brunch but I am a little weary after almost being salted to death with the other plates."}
{"text":"How do I go 62 years without having pastrami with Pastrami gravy???? That's right (oy, who knew? ), pastrami gravy. I've paid 16 bucks for a pastrami sandwich at Katz's deli in Manhattan, but I have to come to this joint to find the ultimate topping for my favorite cured cut.   A couple of great beers and the Brussels sprouts,  made this a meal to remember. I will return next time I have business on that side of town!"}
{"text":"Wifey had the pork tostadas, and all the other little Yelpers were absolutely correct: STUPENDOUS!  Dump salad is as it states, a little of a lot of things. Salad.  Extensive beer in can/bottle list if I cared to drink my beer that way. Short tap list, and sadly none that rang my bell.  Wait staff weren't \"on it\". We waited 5 minutes before anyone came by, and there was a glum aspect to their attitudes.  I'll try it again at dinner instead of Happy Hour, because I believe all you little Yelpers' reviews."}
{"text":"Pig & Pickle, thank you for renewing my faith in Arizona's take on the Gastropub.    If you happen to be within 20 miles of this restaurant and don't make an effort to stop in you're crazy.  The food is a creative twist on your favorite comfort food items.  Pork belly with pureed yams?  Yes, please?  Homemade marshmallows for your ice cream cookie'ish desert treat?  YES PLEASE!   Tiny tostadas with itty bitty slices of kimchi??????  I'm in love...   They even have a vegan burger, for those who are interested.  For the rest of us they'll slap a slice of bacon on that vegan burger at no charge.    The location is easy to get in and out of, which is awesome.  The parking was great.  The prices are exceptionally reasonable.  The food was stellar.    I also hear they're getting ready to start doing brunch on the weekends.  I'm gonna need a new cab driver to keep on call."}
{"text":"Exceptional locally sourced food! My son loved the buffalo pork shanks and blue cheese crumbles and the quinoa salad hit my vegetable craving perfectly!"}
{"text":"I will try not to gush.  Early Valentines Day dinner with Spousal Unit. Pig & PIckle was his idea - all I thought was \"oh, no, not another BBQ joint\".  PRAYER ANSWERED!!  Definitely NOT another \"anything\" this place is UNIQUE.  1. Public parking lot - No valet YAY huge plus! 2. Open floor plan, comfortable space between tables - full view of kitchen which is like watching a silent culinary opera, those guys are inspired (and quiet!) 3. Old Skool Cocktail menu - THANKS for the inspiration, I am terrible at ordering cocktails unless prompted by a creative menu listing.  I got something with Gin & Absinth in it and it complemented my meal perfectly!  French Press Coffee.  I'm a believer now, so fresh it made my tastebuds smile. Carrol Cake.  It's a deconstructed, fresh ingredient, dessert experience. Pork Tostado Starter.  and Finisher. and In-Betweener.  We could make a meal of this item. The pork is almost creamy and the kimchi is nicely handled! Tot O' The Day -  a creamy crusty ball of potato love.  He had a pork burger? with bacon? and cheese? what's not to love, something about the way his eyes rolled back in his head told me it was a culinary win! and finally..............Duck on cassoulet. Scrumptious.  Took the advice of my server to add the Foie Gras.  Oh My.  My Oh My. Yes.  Service was attentive, not pretentious, friendly, helpful - these people love their menu and We Do Too.  EAT LOCAL!  DRINK OLD SKOOL COCKTAILS!"}
{"text":"First visit and it didn't disappoint! Seared foie gras was amazing!  My husband had the hanger steak - it was fantastic. I'm not typically a fan of tator tots however they were super yummy! Can't recommend Pig & Pickle enough. Can't wait to go back! Go Pack Go"}
{"text":"Such a great place!  We stopped by this afternoon during happy hour and brought our furry friend to enjoy the dog friendly patio.  The space both indoor and out is great...good vibe to it and super friendly staff!    The beer, wine and cocktail list is quite extensive and extremely reasonable during happy hour from 4-6pm.  The tots are a must try too...today's flavor was beef and broccoli...yum!    It was such a nice touch that our server brought our pup her own bowl of water and two homemade peanut butter and bacon dog cookies shaped like bones...they had me from the get go with a move like this!"}
{"text":"TO DIE FOR!!!! Place to go for a cheat meal!!! Talk about comfort food... I wish this place's atmosphere was nicer the food is surprisingly very gourmet and well thought out menus, service is excellent but the atmosphere is a little low budget... But still I enjoyed my experience here several times, not a place you want to go on a first date but more like the place you want to go with your best friend to pig out..  List of recommendations  -The seared Carrot Cake. (pure orgasum in your mouth)  -Macaroni and cheese (three cheese delight)  - Tator tots (addictive)"}
{"text":"A friend of mine already knew about this place but forgot about it until he found it on Yelp. 3 of us made it near the end of their happy hour and I was in the mood to try something new. Personally, I'm a fan of wheat beers and decided to try the Konig Ludwig Weiss, I absolutely loved this beer and will return just for the beer as I don't know anywhere else in the area that carries it.  I ordered the pork tostadas as an appetizer. I wish the server told me how large the portions were because they were huge and I wasn't hungry from the dinner I had ordered. This appetizer was great and on the Happy Hour Menu. For dinner I got duck over some berries and mustard seeds. Normally I'm not a fan of mustard but I really enjoyed this aspect of the meal. The duck was eh-ok. The portion size of the duck wasn't that much considering it costs about $15 and it was a bit too well done for my liking.  The service was ok. Everyone was really nice but I felt as if the waitress was a bit new so I gave her some leeway. Overall, I enjoyed the place. If you don't come during happy hour your bill with 1 drink will probably be about $25 plus per person. I'll be back for the beer and appetizers."}
{"text":"Let me start the review by saying this is one of my favorite restaurants and one of my favorite dishes.   The atmosphere at the restaurant is cool  Very relaxing.   You can tell the owner is a big hip hop head which is dope to me!   Real hip hop too,  not that watered down radio stuff.   I heard nas illmatic when I first walked in and felt right at home.    The waiters were super cool too!   Felt like I was talking to good friends that I've known for years.   Now to the food.   The food is defiantly something different but super tasty.  Everything I tasted was delicious.   The wings,  the bread and the drinks were defiantly on point.    I wrote all of that to tell you about my favorite dish.    The pork shank with blue cheese crumbles.   That shit is so good I had to give the chef a high five!   I just have gone back for just the pork shank 7 times will I was visiting Scottsdale.   Also they are open late which is a plus.    This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Amazing been driving by forever and first time I ate here was tonight. I am seriously mad I drove past for a year. Great menu passionate staff locally sourced food. Unique combos of flavors that you don't see they look bold but everything blends and balances very well. For sure check this out."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Arizona for a fundraiser so right when we landed, we got our rental car and headed straight to Pig & Pickle because we know that we won't eat at the fundraiser.   3 stars because my drink didn't mirror the description on the menu so I was disappointed.   The menu we saw through the Yelp pages were different from the menu we got.  When we arrived, we got the brunch menu.  It was still good but I wished we could have ordered from the dinner menu.  So when we're in Phoenix again, we will go there for dinner.    We got there around 11:30am and got seated in about 15 minutes so the wait wasn't too long.   We ordered the following:  Bacon & Cheddar Waffle with Bourbon Maple Syrup ($10): So good, lots of bacon bits.    Croque Madam ($13): it was huge!!!  Lots of ham, cheese and a thick piece of bread.  There was more meat than bread so that was a plus for me.    Side of pork belly ($4): it was OK, I don't know why I always order pork belly when I see it on the menu, I really don't like eating pieces of fat.    Side of bacon ($4): we got so much bacon where we thought that we got 3 sides of bacon!  Biscuits and Gravy ($12): my husband said that it was a little spicy and very filling.   Dylon, Dylon, Dylon, Dylon & Dylon ($8):  this was the disappointed drink I ordered.  It has Pineapple Thai Chili Vodka, passion orange juice, fresh sour, soda and a spicy candied pineapple.  It didn't have the candied pineapple and they told me that they ran out a while back.  I ordered this drink because of the candied pineapple.  I was so bummed.   I will definitely go back to try their dinner menu, after that I will do a total body cleanse with all the fat I would have consumed with just one meal."}
{"text":"Short on words.......Great atmosphere, Astounding food and drinks, Outstanding service???. Will return very soon"}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood and this place was our first sit down. Awesome waitress who walked us through the menu and even got me to tried pickled carrots! I hate carrots and I are them all. Great vibe....great music. It is clear that they are passionate about every item on the menu and it tastes like it!! Try the drinks on happy hour....they grow everything local and you can taste the difference. Definite recommendation."}
{"text":"\"Pork shoulder tostadas.  Order the pork shoulder tostadas.  Don't order anything else. Stick with the pork shoulder tostadas\"  This is what I repeat to myself every time I go to the P&P.  I've tried the white fish (yuck and expensive), the vegetarian shepherds pie (awful), the porchetta (not for me).  But the pork shoulder tostada never disappoints.    And Sean, dear Sean, it is never cool to lean on the table or squat next to the table.  Stand up straight and don't make me wait 20 minutes for the check."}
{"text":"These guys always deliver and recommend this place for the food.  It's Not fancy and it's not a typical Scottsdale place where it's all about superficial looks and no substance.    Great ingredients, thoughtful preparation, and flawless service.    Come for the pork belly, stay for the blackberry pie!"}
{"text":"My favorite bar and restaurant in Scottsdale. The staff remembers your name after the first time you visit. The food is unique and cooked with passion. The drinks are amazing and memorable. P&P is always clean and has a great group of customers.  Seriously folks, this place rocks. You have to try the Apocalypse Sow or the Bulgogi wraps. Or anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place!   I have been multiple times, brought so many friends and family members! We fall in love with every new item they bring to the menu. We swear by their Brussel sprouts(+bacon) & the cocktail 'bramble on.' Going later this week with friends to try the late-night menu!"}
{"text":"Had a really strange experience here... Ordered 3 cheeses, and they came out as small samples compared to other places we've been nearby, so we were a little surprised by the serving size. The burger was great though... But we were surprised that for an extra $1.50, we simply had two bite sized mashed potato balls (the tater tots). The tots were delicious, but again portion size was confusing--we expected at least 4. And then when it came to paying the bill, they lost my credit card yet charged me an additional tip when I tipped cash... Weird experience, never found my credit card, couldn't enjoy the place, but they make a solid burger."}
{"text":"This has become a favorite go-to spot.   One check in, but been here maybe twenty times. The pickled plate and the tots are always an order.  Recently tried the pork and kimchi tostadas starter.  Excellent. The ODB cocktail is great as well.  Real chill, great service and food.  Live music and a couple of big screens top it off."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks at night. Zack was our bartender. He was amazing! Perfect drinks! Perfect recommendations! Hands down, if you want to go to a bar with amazing cocktails and beers, this is your place!!!"}
{"text":"We've had breakfast here a couple times. Good food and ambiance, it never seems busy. Patio is nice but the traffic from the Thomas/Hayden intersection is loud. Not the best location."}
{"text":"The word is finally getting out on this place so I will throw in my 2 cents.  Been coming here for a couple of years now, the food is all about the contrast, a unique culinary experience. Hence the Pig & Pickle. All the ingredients are top quality and uniquely sourced.   They try hard behind the bar, perhaps too much, time has not changed my opinion. The energy in the bar drops my review by 1/2 star as I always eat my meals in the bar area. Can't put my finger on what puts me off, all I know is I tend to leave directly after I eat. (Not a normal occurrence for me)  No worries as i come here mainly for the food, I am constantly surprised by the unique dishes these boys dream up. Nothing else like it in the Valley.   You have to try this place out for yourself."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents and a friend, and we loved it! The croque madame with tater tots were amazing, although the tots were not a traditional deep fried potato tot, but more of a fried ball of mashed potatoes with hot dog somewhere in the mix. And, of course, being from California, we had to get TWO orders of foie gras (because it's illegal here), but so worth it. The bone marrow and lardo on toast were both very good, but what really stood out was the duck leg. My parents and I are hardcore foodies and it's hard to find duck that isn't dry and overcooked, but they did great! Overall, great staff and food, will definitely come back the next time we're in Arizona."}
{"text":"Met five other guys for lunch from our Saturday golf group.  Pig & Pickle is in a pretty run down shopping center and does not look like much from the parking lot.  Once inside the decor is really nicely done.  The menu at lunch was great with a variety of \"sammies\".  I had the Club Sandwich which was excellent with pork belly, ham and turkey.  Several of the guys had the \"Apocalypse Sow\"  which was huge (but they all finished every bite).  Had a great time and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pork everything! Delicious and a bit pricey but you get what you pay for: Quality. We ordered the pork burger with fries and the cheesy broccoli soup."}
{"text":"Good service, good food. Good actually sums up this place pretty well.  The star of the night was the Pork Buffalo shanks, really good. The desert, a deconstructed version of Elvis presleys Peanut butter and bananas, was good.   The only downside of the night was the pork belly, it was far too dry. In their defense after we informed the waitress they did provide another pork belly free. And while it was better, it still was not as good as some of their competitor offerings (aka melt in your mouth).  All in all it was a good meal. I would certainly order the Pork Buffalo shanks again, they were really good. And kudos to management for trying to make good on the pork belly, they didn't have to do that."}
{"text":"Service is a little arrogant but they should be foods great. I am in the restaurant industry and understand bad days but the times I have eaten here the servers were not very friendly."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying... I'm a vegetarian. Yeah, it's safe to say, I love this place. After being dragged here on several occasions by a good friend, its quickly become a regular in my cache of frequented bars in the 'hood.   Not only because of my dearly beloved brussels sprouts with deliciously oozy egg on top, not only because of the constantly changing, seasonal menu that keeps it interesting, but most of all... the bartenders! Seriously the best. Prepare to have your tastes challenged-they love giving recommendations. They take so much pride in what they do, in *not* being your run of the mill bar. If you like whiskey like me, you'll love this place. And, with a certified sommelier on hand, you can guarantee you're in good hands. She's great.   I always appreciate when restaurants/bars go out of their way to source the best ingredients, and this place definitely lives up to that standard. All of the cocktails are fantastic and not cloyingly sweet. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the patio leaves a bit to be desired because the view isn't that great BUT they do give you a peanut butter dog biscuit if you bring Fido so go ahead."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places to get food!!!  Their head chef is just amazing.  The only reason it did not get 5 stars is for the wait staff.  They kind of suck.  Only reason that they get 4 stars is because of their amazing food.  Food 5 stars , wait staff 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Update: If you want insight into how this place operates, look at the sardonic, unapologetic, and passive aggressive responses the owner gives to ratings he deems unfair (basically all the one or two star ratings). Why would you want to spend money at a place that doesn't care whether you enjoyed yourself?   Review:  My boyfriend and I live a few miles down the road and we are always looking for places to eat that are a bike ride away. The Pig & Pickle has been on our list of places to try for awhile, so we decided to drop in tonight. While my boyfriend was locking up our bikes, I grabbed a table. Water was put on the table right away and a server came right over to take my drink order. I told her I wanted to wait until my boyfriend sat down and to please come back in a minute or two. About a minute later, my boyfriend came in. It took another ten minutes for someone to finally remember to stop by and take our drink orders. Before we gave the server our drink orders, I asked him if I could swap the Swiss cheese on the Cuban sandwich for cheddar or provolone (I HATE Swiss cheese--I know some people love it, but in my opinion, the smell and taste completely detracts from whatever I'm trying to eat). I made sure to ask before we ordered anything because I saw (in very small print) that substitution requests would be ignored, which I found a little strange. The server looked really stressed when I made the request and said he would have to ask the kitchen. When I glanced over at the open kitchen, there were two guys doing nothing--one was even on his phone. Anyway, when the server came back, he told me they would be happy to take the cheese off, but I would not be permitted to have any other cheese on the sandwich. You'd think for a $14 sandwich, you could have whatever kind of cheese you want (with the exception of goat cheese, of course), especially since the substitution is an easy swap and they weren't busy. I guess they really meant it when they said all substitutions would be ignored. Consequently, my boyfriend and I were pretty annoyed. When a restaurant won't honor substitution requests of any kind, they better be world renowned or a Zagat rated five-stars. Otherwise, I'm just going to assume they are lazy or pretentious weirdos, who think they know better than the customer. Consequently, we left and went down the street to the Mexican restaurant, The Blind Pig. I ended up having a delicious, authentic Cuban sandwich, made according to my preferences, all for only $10! Extremely serendipitous!! Obviously, we won't be returning to the Pig & Pickle."}
{"text":"Short Story  Very good Pig and Very Good Pickles. The plates are protein heavy , nearly perfect and you can easily eat Pig PIG and MORE pig in a comfortable casual setting. (Insert the Monty Python Spam song here but use Pig instead of the spam word.) With a daily changing menu.  Long Story  They have many interesting starter plates we picked the pickles and the cheese plate so we could have variety . The pickle plate was colorful and impressive. Each vegetable or fruit I tried all tasted different and was interesting. I thought the cheese plate was very good since it was made of better cheeses  , it also was a good sharing size.   We had a Pork Porterhouse that was perfect and came with well seasoned beans and we also had a trout dish that differed from the on-line menu example but was delicious and prepared masterfully . Both dishes were light with the vegetables. The only real starch on the trout plate was the breading from the shrimp.  Decided to try a dessert since most have pig in them so we went for a less piggy option and tried the pretzel bread pudding topped with the BEST IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD peanut butter ice-cream. A yummy blackberry complimented this dessert making it taste like a yummy peanut butter and jelly sandwich. This dessert was nearly perfect my only criticism is that the bread pudding was chewy and hard but it was so tasty I ate it anyway.  Our server was very well trained and knew the menu well.  The ladies room was clean and nice but the stall was extremely small with the door opening in instead of out so even if you are tiny it's hard to get out.  Very solid very good."}
{"text":"Amazing food, if you don't know what to get, ask your server. Service is impressive. Try the vinegar pie and the pork bellies."}
{"text":"When I first came to Pig & Pickle, I didn't know what to think of the menu. Now that I've been here a few times, I can definitely appreciate the approach that P&P takes to their food. I love the fact that it is always changing, and that it's fresh and different from most places in town.  From what I've had here, I definitely recommend the pork shoulder tostadas and charcuterie to start out. If you're feeling adventurous, get the \"pickled things\".  For entrees, the burger is always a safe choice but the mussels in white wine with chorizo really steals the show - my girlfriend has literally been quoted as saying, \"I can't believe I'm eating mussels on Thomas and Hayden and actually loving it.\" Last night I had the pretzel crusted chicken breast with ratatouille - lawdy lawd it was good.   What I will say is you absolutely CANNOT come here without ordering their \"tots\" on the side. These things are special, friggin' delicious, and always changing with their ingredients.  Lastly, they have an event space for groups in the back which is nice, they post local art on the walls that you can buy which is cool, and they have a good happy hour. You can have a lot of the appetizers for $5 (including the tostadas and charcuterie) as well as some wine and cocktails for five bucks. Boo-yah.  Yes, yes, and yes to Pig & Pickle."}
{"text":"Decides to try a new place for a late lunch between client appointments. Since they opened at 3pm it worked well I stop in. Sadly they only have a happy hour menu until they start dinner at 4pm. Seems like a waste to open a bar/restaurant and not have an active kitchen the whole time. I know 330pm is t a normal mean time, but it tends to be for someone whose day is scheduled around client appointments. I'll give the $5 happy hour food items, only 5 items on the list, a try while I wait for access to real food. They also don't have Dr. Pepper."}
{"text":"I arrived before my party, hungry. It was a Friday night, I was sat in a high top, near the bar. I ordered an app right away..a crispy rock shrimp($14). The remoulade was to die for, with diced kalamata. I ordered the ribeye with gratin potatoes for my entree ($27). My other 2 guests arrived, and ordered a burger, and 2 add ons of pork belly. Here's where it gets murky..one pork belly dish arrived, so we thought it was the two sides combined, then a few mins later, another small side appears, we send it back, because we thought we already had received ours, it turns out, when we get the check he rang us in for 2 pork belly appetizers (received only one app plate) I was trying to eat my ribeye, and explain to the server what had happened, (he seemed super busy, and impatient the whole experience, rushing my friends through their orders.) He took the app that we didn't order, or receive off, thankfully..but still charged us full price for the one we didn't order. The steak was great paired with the remoulade that I'm in love with, the gratin was cold in the middle. Sad. The service was rushed, and towards the end, the hostess approached us, and asked if we, meaning my friend and I would help her move our table, so the band could set up. She looked shocked when I simply replied \"no\". The place doubles as an art gallery, which is neat, but they were featuring about 4 different artists, with 4 different color schemes, and even varying styles. Pretty painful to the eye. All in all, it's an okay place set in a stip mall, decorated with the Sunday comics."}
{"text":"I was SO excited to hear about this place opening up just a short drive/nice walk from my apartment, as there is nothing remotely this interesting menu-wise in this area. However, I found myself getting disappointed over and over throughout my experience here.   First, the bad stuff:  Bf and I walked in and it took at least five full minutes before anyone even acknowledged us...and there's not really a host stand or any signs indicating if one should seat themselves or to wait to be directed by a host to a table. We stood there looking hopeless and hungry, trying to catch the eye of anyone on the waitstaff who all ignored us before someone came from behind the bar and greeted us, seating us at a table near the bar area. The space is beautiful and huge-I never went here when it was Detours but was surprised it was so spacious as it doesn't seem like it would be from the outside.   The service was pretty much awful, the waitress taking FOREVER to put in any orders (she only had a few tables from what we could tell...and I've been a waitress before so I know how long these things should take!). The first drinks took a while to get to us, and she didn't take our order until wayyyy after our drinks were delivered, despite the numerous attempts at eye contact. We had to actually reach out and tap her when she was walking by to get her attention, not a good sign. After our apps, we had to wait another longgg while before entrees arrived.   When I wanted a second cocktail I waited...and waited...and waited some more. Then I decided to just go on up to the bar myself as I saw the waitress still hadn't put the order in, and told the bartender that I had ordered from the waitress but that I didn't think she had put it in yet, and he was not surprised-he said she did the same thing with my first drink! Well that explains why it took forever to get either round of drinks...the waitress wasn't putting them in the computer after I ordered them. And no, even though I had to wait forever and order it myself they didn't take it off the bill like most places would, most likely because no one noticed. I didn't want to make a scene and it wasn't that big of a deal, but most restaurants I frequent would NEVER let something like that happen. Just sayin'.   Now onto the good stuff:  The menu at this place has SO much creativity and potential! We ordered the pork shoulder tostadas for an app and this was an amazingly delicious dish...I just wish there was more of it. It was three teeny tiny corn tortilla shells topped with the pork shoulder mixture that had a seasoning so delicious, I was literally spooning the juice left over from the plate into my mouth. I had a long time to sit with this empty app dish before the waitress ever came by to take our entree order, so I got to enjoy the plate juice for quite a while.   The menu here reminds me of my favorite restaurant's menu, noca. Bacon and me get along well, and I was 100% ready to fall in love with this restaurant when I saw they had *FREE* bacon on their vegan burger! I love vegan food AND I love bacon, so this was a theoretical match made in heaven. Now, many vegan burgers have corn in them, so I asked if this was made with corn because my stomach+whole corn kernels=bad, and the waitress assured me that while it was made with corn, it was \"all mixed up in there, it's not very much and you don't even know it's in there\". I was surprised to see that there was TONS of corn in whole kernel form alllll up in that burger. Luckily I was able to pick it out, though that left very little \"burger\" left to eat, but just be warned if you have any corn issues that this burger is not for you.   However, if you love regular beef burgers, the burger here is fantastic! Bf ordered this and it was amazingly tasty-he got it with bacon and it was heavenly. Bacon costs $2.50 extra on non-vegan burgers, fyi. He ordered fries but the waitress brought him salad instead, though once he mentioned it she did have someone bring over fries and they were decent. The salad wasn't anything to write home about, I had one as my side dish as well.  I'd love to chalk the bad service up to this place being new, because the menu is just too enticing to ignore, especially since it's walking distance from my apartment! I am not giving up on this place just yet, fingers crossed that the service improves."}
{"text":"I would say the rating was closer to 3.5 stars than 4.  I decided to give this place a try because they have brussel sprouts on the menu.  Those were delicious.  You can add bacon or pork belly to that dish.  I will warn you, if you don't like salty dishes, do not order this dish.  My daughter ordered the tostadas and sent them back because they were too salty. My son and I ordered the steak with the chimichurri.  That, I would recommend to anyone that enjoys steak.  My husband ordered the burger.  It was huge!  The amount of bacon that the burger had was more then generous.   Good service."}
{"text":"The tastes are unique and refined, the atmosphere is loose, and I'm listening to Common through the speakers, what more do you want???"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant at the moment. The service is phenomenal, very casual and personal but with the attentiveness and attention to detail that one would expect from fine dining. I love the craft cocktails, the bone marrow is to die for and the shrimp and grits are what every southerner dreams about. You won't find grits that good anywhere in Arizona, I promise. I can't get enough of this spot!"}
{"text":"They were very unprofessional with getting a catering order done for our company, took weeks to respond with menus and feedback and then decided to cancel last minute (literally day of) because they couldn't scrounge up some plates and silverware for a company of 95 people. I will come back to elaborate with pictures if Karma isn't able to finish it's job with the flood they had a week ago. Looks like you needed my well wishes after all."}
{"text":"FOODIE delight! Ambience is nice, casual and a bit noisy; it's a social hub in the dining room and the bar. A few on the patio. Menu changes often at the whim of the Chef, so your favorite might not be on the menu....opening your mind to a NEW favorite. Service is friendly, but not overwhelming and since the menu is very creative, the server has knowledge to guide you.  This is my 2nd time here and I will be back with friends."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I had the cheese plate and mussels. The mussels were great until I had a bad one from the batch. I guess that's what can happen but it put a bad taste in my mouth for a couple hrs. Maybe a warning label???? Other than that I would go again but try something different"}
{"text":"Gotta say that I've been here three times with friends and we all agree--food is amazing. Service?  Sort of like they are doing us a favor and frankly seem irritated we came in. We've had three different servers each time and it's all the same. Would it kill you guys to be fun and friendly?  Last night topped it off. Friends from Ahwatukee drove all the way to meet us for Happy Hour. We ordered drinks and a few appetizers. Before we finished them our server removed our plates and silverware. We had to call him back to say we weren't finished and could we have our plates back. Did he say \"Sorry\"?  Nope. Just grumpy we asked."}
{"text":"Great craft selection awesome vibe. Concept is simple yet very strong \"Pig n Pickle,\" is a great late night spot with crazy good food. The bartenders are wicked friendly and will remember your name, you will quickly feel like a regular. Good range of harder liquors as well."}
{"text":"This place was bomb.   The pork belly appetizer was super tender and delicious. I got The Nancy, which is a veggie sandwich with a shiz ton of brie on it, so you  know it was good. My favorite part of the meal may have been the tater tots... Such fancy and detectable tots stuffed with bacon and cheese and herbs. The service was awesome, too! The waiter had great suggestions. Some random bar tender yelled, \"See you tomorrow!\" when we left, which was pretty hilarious.   Okay, first Yelp review: complete."}
{"text":"Flew to the Phoenix area for the first time to visit a friend and went to Pig & Pickle for a Sunday brunch. I ordered the ground burger, medium rare, and my friend ordered the P&P Benedict. My burger came out medium but I'm used to that at this point. Besides that, it was absolutely delicious and my friend said her p&p benedict was heavenly. Of course we had to order mimosas and bloody sconnie. Both drinks came out fresh and delicious. All in all, this place is top notch. Definitely will plan another trip when I visit Phoenix again"}
{"text":"Feels more like Portland then Scottsdale which is very welcome.  A very accommodating staff and a menu that allows you to explore alternative pieces of animal from the comfort of your middle American sensibilities."}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly recommended to me and my family, so we decided to try venturing outside of our comfort zone and trying a new restaurant. As the name implies, the menu is mainly focused on meat and pickled items. I had the pork belly that was to die for. My dad had the pork burger - topped with bacon, it seemed like an item from the Heart Attack Grill's menu, but he thoroughly enjoyed it. P&P has a great beer and wine list. Very friendly service and a relaxed atmosphere. We'll be back when we're in the area again!"}
{"text":"Had our last dinner of the night before we left Arizona the next day. Boyfriend came across this cute place called \"Pig & Pickles\". We came on a Monday night of Memorial Day, assuming that everyone has work the next day, this place was pretty empty around 9pm.   We did not know they were part of the Arizona Restaurant week, so we were curious of what they had for it. After overlooking menu, it was $30 per person for 3 course, so we each decided to get it and share.  First Course: + roasted bone marrow+green garlic & spring onion compote  Two bone marrows were served under green garlic spring onions and a side of sliced bread. Delicious when you scoop some marrow onto the bread then add a bit of the green garlic spring onion and yum  +mushroom crostini+pistachio pesto Mushroom crostini in pistachio pesto was served on top of two sliced toast. Mushrooms well sauteed and the flavors were good.  Second Course:  + the dump truck' - mixed lettuces, shaved veggies, seeds, cucumber and shallot vinaigrette  Loved how the dressing was light and everything was fresh.  +wedge salad - bacon, egg, cucumber, tomato, radish and buttermilk bleu cheese Not a bleu cheese person, however, boyfriend enjoyed it. You can request to put the dressing on the side. Crunchy wedges!  Third Course: crispy skin chicken - bacony red potatoes, creamed leaks, arugula Chicken was flavorful and very crispy. You just need to take a small piece of the chicken and eat it with the potatoe, creamed leaks and arugula.  + pork porchetta - roasted pork belly, homemade sausage, creamed corn, heirloom tomato & arugula Heaven in your mouth! A thick slice of pork belly wrapped around homemade sausage and served with creamed corn? The combination was just perfection. This is a must get if you love pork belly.   Overall, we loved our meals and sure did get full off of it. The meals were big and we were informed that we can purchase one restaurant of the week and share among two people, so it'll save you some bucks."}
{"text":"I had the eggs benedict and it was super silky and DELICIOUS!!!!! Jennifer was our server and she was amazing! Definitely going back for both the food and service!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, very foodie.  One of the few places in town that has great food late."}
{"text":"We came here because I had a restaurant.com gift certificate. We started with the pork belly, which was amazing...very tender and flavorful. Then we had the broccoli and brown ale soup, which was topped with bacon...heaven! I finished with the drunken chicken, which was a little different than I expected, but still very good. My husband had the pork burger and turkey-bacon tater tots, both of which were very good. Next time we are in Scottsdale, I think we will make it a point to come back."}
{"text":"We always have such a great experience here!  My husband and I stopped in and ordered fairly simple dishes, but the food had that amazing foodie wow factor.  The dump truck salad was super simple - greens, sliced cauliflower, sliced carrots, baby tomatoes, radishes with a light, fresh dressing that added to the effect.  It was so fresh, it tasted like we were eating on a farm!  Perfect to split.   The Friday fish fry (available all week) - their version of fish and chips - was some of the best I've ever had.  The descriptions of panko breading and vinegar flavor on the fries drew us out of our usual no-fry ordering.  Wow, this did not disappoint - fish cooked to perfection, bursting with light, fried flavor and the fries were lovely, as well!  Hurry in because the menu changes frequently, and this dish is worth the trip.  Ooh, and the service was impeccable, as usual!"}
{"text":"You know it's been one killer experience after another here.  Great drinks, kick ass staff and food that is nothing short of cajones out magnificent.  No joke....You're taste-buds will be begging for more.  I have the utmost and sincerest faith in that.    I was here a little while back with a gal I am friends with.  I got a burger and she went healthy with a salad.  Nothing short of great.   I love these guys and I'm so glad they're in business."}
{"text":"Different yet satisfying. I'm a fan of exotic foods and this place was just what I was looking for in Phoenix/Scottsdale area! The drinks are on point too. Strong and flavorful! We only had two of the appetizers but I must admit that I really liked the menu and the eclectic variety offered. I'm looking forward to trying it again on my next Phoenix visit! :)"}
{"text":"The BEST place for late night eats, night cap cocktails, or any kind of chill food or drink. Try the tots, bulkogi lettuce wraps, and/or pork shoulder tostadas. Great staff, great music, great food, great drinks."}
{"text":"P&P = Gastropub that caters to the restaurant industry folks after hours with some lively patrons, some interesting bar bites and libations. The in between hours aren't so bad either.  Plus an early and late version of HH.  This is one of those blink and you would miss it and definitely not on the radar for most visitors unless a local pointed you in their direction. It definitely has a cozy, neighborhood feel once inside that belies the edge of the strip mall location.   I happened upon the P & P after a charity golf tournament in the area. Some of the players in our group couldn't say enough good things about the P and P. We decided to meet up after getting cleaned up later in the evening. As the night meandered on the place began to fill with servers, bar keeps and chefs and all manner of industry folks made their way over.   We had already managed to grab several of the somewhat limited seating at the bar to sample some of the tasty treats on special after 10.  The pork shoulder tostados were my favorite, make no mistake there is a reason the word Pig is in their title. They have more than a few dishes with divine swine involved.   We also tried the duck fat fries( only late night) and the Bulgogi lettuce wraps. I have to say yes again to the fries but no to the lettuce wraps. The beef was just too sinew laden, chewy and tough and way too salty.   All in all the small group of us found the staff and barkeep super friendly, attentive and just made for a better dining and drinking experience. The place isn't so loud you or crowded that you can't have a conversation even as it fills up. I am sure it can get shoulder to shoulder during it's busiest hours but we didn't have that experience.  A nice hidden but not so secret neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Great ambience, great beers. Why not 5 stars?? Ordered a cherry beer and a blueberry beer. Tasted really delicious. I guess they are seasonal and you might have to rush to get to try some.  Did not try food here though. So, prolly I'm gonna update this review after a try."}
{"text":"Outstanding! The pork burger was fantastic as well as the interestingly fabulous pork tostados!"}
{"text":"Somehow on the way to pick up sandwiches for dinner, we ended up at Pig & Pickle.  We should plan on sandwiches for dinner more often!  There was quite the age range of customers which must be a testament to the quality of food.  I also must be in the upper range since I did notice it was extremely loud.  Definitely not a place for a quiet, romantic dinner.  But a great place for a great cocktail and equally great meal.  I had to forgo the cocktail instead having a boring sparkling water with lime.  But I was pleased to see mussels on the menu which is one of my favorite lighter meals.  It was a decent sized portion for a modest price of $15.  Served in a rich and flavorful broth of white wine, tomatoes, and creme fraiche with plenty left for soaking into your bread (I ordered extra bread).  I did get a grain of sand in a couple of them, but overall it was a nice dish.  My husband had the bone-in pork chop cooked perfectly with the slightest hint of pink still there.  He also gave a thumbs up to the accompanying succotash.  As for the oven roasted bone marrow he ordered, I did not go there.  It was a significantly smaller portion than served at Searsucker, but was also priced quite a bit lower at $9.  He did like it, however.  I should also note, service was excellent!  In fact, all the servers seemed to be doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Sunday 10/16 at around 6:00PM. My boyfriend is in his 50s and is an F&B manager at a country club with over 35 years of food and beverage service. I'm in my 40s; I am now in medicine but I was a wine somm with over 20 years of my own F&B. We know both front and back of the house well. We love to dine out and appreciate service as much as good food. This was a casual night out for us. At P&P we were greeted and allowed to choose a seat outside. Our server was Jake. I asked him \"how is business?\" He said, \"it's slow tonight - there's the Taco Fest and people that can afford to spend to money at restaurants are out of town\". My boyfriend and I just looked at each other (....did he really just say that?)... He took our drink order as well as appetizers. He asked if we wanted waters. Our cocktails and appetizers arrived before the water was finally delivered. The Brussel sprouts app came out much quicker than we expected and we thought they were great. However, the lettuce wraps - 3 for $12. Somewhat over-salted, no sauce. In fact, it was as if they were made with soy sauce and a packet of taco seasoning. We were still hungry but had no desire to stay any longer. Jake asked us twice before our appetizers were finished if we wanted anything else. To put us out of our misery, after the second time he asked, I let him know, \"we just stopped by for an quick appetizer and we will take the check.\" It took nearly 10 minutes for the check to arrive. Tito's on the rocks, a ginger beer, Brussel sprouts and lettuce wraps = $35. Gave him a credit card. When he returned for me to sign the check, he asked if we were finished with our food. We said yes, at which point he then reached through my arms (as I was signing the check) to retrieve every last plate and utensil on the table, and hurried away. A place that touts \"we dig the pig\" - and NO pork ribs? Something to consider. More important to consider is wait staff training. As I mentioned before, we both have a few years experience in the biz. We understand when and how things are done well and when things are not. We are not snobs; we do give a fair critique. Being insulted and hurried doesn't bode well. Customer service is of utmost importance. It wouldn't have mattered if the food was amazing - we will not return to P&P."}
{"text":"Walked in on a whim at about 630-7pm on a Saturday night with my man-friend.  The hostess told us it would be about 15 mins as they were full at the moment. No worries, the bf was just glad to have a tv with the game on in front of him.  Checked out the drink menu at the bar for a few minutes... Nice beer selection and good drink prices!  They have craft cocktails, but I went for a beer since they had Konig Ludwig. =)  For dinner, I debated on the pork tostadas and the vegan burger with bacon... The bacon is a FREE add-on!!  The waitress suggested pork tostadas, so thats what I had.  Quite tasty!! There were 3 tostadas with piles of pork! They had a great ginger aioli and crunchy/spicy kimchee. 2 of them filled me up, but I went ahead and ate the 3rd one since the bf was too full from his tri-tip dinner.  Needless to say, neither one of us had room for dessert.  The service was good and friendly and overall it was a good dinner.  The only thing I didn't care for was the $3 charge for a soda water at the bar when I ordered a beer. Fizzy water for 3 bucks?!  My bf almost exclusively chooses soda water/club soda over flat water, and I have never been charged for it when it comes out of the tap.  Just sayin."}
{"text":"First of all... The bread pudding was to die for. Save room for dessert or eat it first. The macaroni and cheese was very good. They didn't skimp on the cheese at all. Lots of it. The dump salad was very crunchy, just like I like it. Nice and fresh. And Rick, our waiter, couldn't have been better. I will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Yay! Rejoice! There is finally a foodie spot in south Scottsdale less than a mile away from me that brings some hipster cred to the corner of Hayden and Thomas Roads. The Pig & Pickle just opened, serving up a pork-heavy dinner menu paired with a variety of beers and handcrafted cocktails. While the interior gives off a sports bar vibe with an open kitchen, the menu features local ingredients in comfort food style dishes that give the place a warm, welcoming feel.  I had a really great vegan burger ($8), made with beans, grains and seeds. It was tasty and filling, and I really enjoyed the seasoned fries that came with it.  My friend got the creamy broccoli and and brown ale with cheddar soup ($7), which he said was great, as well as a pot roast sammie ($10), with carmelized onions, havarti and chile aioli. It looked like a hearty sandwich, and he said it really tasted fresh.  I'd go back to the Pig & Pickle to try their mac n' cheese -- and I'm also curious how their appetizer of pickles would stand out. The spot is also cool because it serves food until 1 a.m., which is great for Old Town Scottsdale nightclubbers who want a foodie fix."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I absolutely love this restaurant!  We've been here multiple times and enjoy their unique dishes and ever changing menu.  You have to have a creative pallet to truly appreciate this restaurant"}
{"text":"I really want to like this restaurant because the pork belly appetizer is delish, I give that dish a 5 star but that's it. The drunken chicken is soupy and no flavor to it and I ask the server if it's suppose to be like that, her response is that's how we serve it here, so I split my burger with my friend bcoz he can't eat it except for the carrots that's in it. Now for the pork burger I forgot what's it's called, the bacon is over cooked and tough it's hurts my tooth to eat it and the pickle that goes with it is too sour, u can even eat it. When we paid I told the lady when we're ask how was the food we said ok to be polite she ask how can we make it better how are u suppose to answer that if we already address it before with the server and server didn't take care of it, we're not there to get a free meal so we paid and left. Thanks we have a discount coupon, I can't see paying a full price for that meal. We're not going back there."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about my first dinning experience at Pig and Pickle! I have wanted to try this place since they opened since it's a mile from my house, boy am I glad I did and sorry I waited so long!   Since it was so nice out my girlfriend and I decided to sit on the patio. Our server came over and loved his dry sense of humor! We got a few recommendations on the cocktails which every ingredient is made FRESH!!! I had the Pineapple Express and she had the Tropical Itch. They were both awesome!  Our server told us about the Tots and they are made fresh and different daily! We each tried one (they are huge like meatballs). OMG AMAZING!!!!  She was going to get the Fish Fry and I was going to get the Littleneck Clams but he reccommeded we eat something they are known for since it was our first time. I agreed. I was looking at the Duck Breast and he said it was great so I decided on that and my girlfriend got another pork dish that was stuffed (can't remember the name). OMG my duck was outstanding! One of the best dishes I can say I've had in quite a long time! I'm still craving it!!!!!  This is a great spot for late night eats/drinks or dinner. The service was great as well as the food. I would suggest this place to anyone and can't wait to go back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I worked with Anthony to orchestrate a surprise birthday dinner for my husband. He went above and beyond to make the experience easy to plan and seamlessly implemented. Our waiter was wonderful. The food and drinks were delicious. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian so I was totally not wanting to try any place with \"Pig\" in it's name. I finally gave in and went with my husband who had been wanting to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty the salads are and there are quite a few dishes I could eat. Since trying this place we have gone back 4 times and it's only been a month. I love everything I have tried and so does my husband. It's rare we find a place we can both enjoy."}
{"text":"I really love this place! The drinks are out of this world (recommend the gin bramble) and the food is delicious. They have a cool concept of this board that says \"Take- Give\" and it encourages people to buy others drinks. I think it is a cool \"pay it forward\" type of idea. I got the pork belly blt and it was so tasty! I was too chicken to get the stuffed tots but I heard they were good!"}
{"text":"Love this place, right when you open the door this amazing smell hits!  Have never had anything bad there and they have some great HH specials!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night. Not too crowded, we got a table right away.  Our waitress was really cute and friendly. The pork shanks appetizer was amazing! It has a buffalo type sauce. I had the frisée and arugula salad which was okay. A bit small. Pumpkin bread pudding was delicious. The pickles that came with the burgers are a little odd.. I like a good ole dill pickle though. Overall good experience and would go back."}
{"text":"what? a veggie burger with a $0 bacon option? how funny. we didn't consider this place at all for a dining option considering the name had \"Pig\" in it. but after a few yelp reviews, we wanted to try their homemade veggie burger.   it's in a rather unassuming corner of a strip mall, so again, i was expecting another BBQ joint. i was very wrong. the interior is modern, sleek, and homey at all once. we opted to sit outside, which has a dog friendly patio. they have more than a few vegetarian meal options. i had the vegetarian shepards pie. it was gigantic and piping hot. filled with mashed potatoes, carrots, huge amounts of kale, peas, beans...i could only muster half and took the other home for leftovers. it was extremely savory and i would definitely order it again.   their beer selection is impressive, but even more so is the means to obtain their ingredients. our server said everything...except the mussels...are bought right here in the valley and all parts of their food menu are made in house, including their bread. i was very impressed.   i hope this place stays around and becomes a staple of our 2 mile dining radius!"}
{"text":"Every time I pass this place I want to stop and check it out. . . Today was the day and I must say we were less than pleased.  First, on a 110° day, the air wasn't working. We arrived for happy hour, but really wanted a real menu. HH food was lack luster:  Mac and cheese wasn't dreamy creamy excellence, it was dried up pasta with some cheese and toppings.  Salad was a little better than ok. I tried the marrow bones and while good, could have used something more on the plate to help cut the rich fattiness of the dish The beer could have been colder, but now I'm whining. Service was good, but I'm sorry, we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place had a really good vibe.  Live music and the server was really cool.  Good crispy skin trout.  Really good, burgers.  Not so good, tots."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of my friends for a going away dinner for one of them. My friends were already waiting for me and as I sat down the waiter , Anthony, was at our table but i don't even think he noticed that I got there because he didn't asked if I wanted a drink or anything. He stopped by our table every 20 minutes just to refill the water and barely even talked to us. When it came to ordering food I asked if the lamb sliders were good and he said they were his favorite. The lamb sliders came out and 50% of it was the bread so I took off the top bun and it was still disgusting. The duck fat fries were alright the fries were very hard. All in all I have no idea why this place has 4 stars the whole experience was awful and a waste of my money."}
{"text":"Read about this place sometime ago but stumbled upon it looking for some thing else during the lunch hour. This place is a fine tuned gourmet treat. Great pork items. All with an upgraded gourmet twist. Kim chi on pork tostadas (awesome!) Fennel in salads. all kinds of delicious variations that up the deliciousness factor of sandwiches and entrees. Craft cocktails. Microbrews and good wines. What is not to love about this place! Somebody has thought long and hard about the food here and delivers with attention to details and presentation. Nice open restaurant with an inviting bar. Open kitchen and friendly laid back atmosphere. Try it. You will love it."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my mom and my boyfriend based off a review in the Phoenix New Times. Right off the bat I loved this place. The decor is so cute, there are many pigs and pickles hanging around the dining room and the kitchen is open to the dining area which I love. Since my first time I've been here more than I can count and each time I've had the best food and have been waited on by the most knowledgeable and friendly staff ever.   The food here changes with the seasons and they offer fresh and local dishes which is refreshing since I like to try new things. Honestly you could get anything on the menu and it will be the most delicious thing you've eaten."}
{"text":"Just go. Great service and stoopid good vittles:) And bring you dog. Staff loves the canine!"}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of this place! Recently enjoyed the pork rinds (chicharrones) and cheese plate over happy hour ($5 each) before digging into the Cuban Pickle Crisis for dinner. It was all great!   The cheese plate featured delicious bread, apricot preserves, dried cherries and delicious almonds along with two types of cheese: one soft and one semi-soft.   The chicharrones were still crackling for several minutes after being brought to the table. As fresh as they were they were not too hot to eat -- which is important because the snaps and pops made us want to dig in SO bad! They were crisp and had just the right amount of salt and paprika. It was a pretty big portion... with three of us enjoying them, there were still a few to take home!  The Cuban sandwich was GREAT! Each component: the ham, the pulled pork and the cheese were delicious on their own; and, together: they were out of this world! For my side, I chose the tots which are really more like mini potato croquets. Think: breaded and fried balls of creamy mashed potatoes! How could that NOT be good, right?"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. The menu is indeed pretty limited.   Service is here and there and seems pretty disorganized. They came back after taking our order to get my order again because they forgot.  I got the crab hash. They dropped something greenmixed with a fried egg on top. Before I dug into it, they took it away because they gave me someone else's plate. My plate came. It was also greenmixed with a fried egg on top so it made the mistake understandable but made me question in the variety of the food.  Anyways, I would not recommend the crab hash. It was surprisingly very creamy. It could be called \"cream of crab hash\". The flavors weren't there and of course, the texture was nonexistent. If I didn't know it was crab, I wouldn't know from tasting it. The only slight upside was the sprinkling of greens that gave it a crunch now and then.   Anyway, the food will seem a bit pretentious if you can't deliver on diverse offerings.   But nice people and unique restaurant hours."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here last night! The day after St. Patrick's Day evidently made for a fairly slow Friday night. We were seated immediately, and taken care of well the entire time. My husband had the bone marrow, and I saw a smile on his face that let me know all of the stress of the day had disappeared. He said his duck was the best he's ever had. I'll take his word on that, I'm not a fan of duck. I have a sensitive stomach, and have to order carefully to avoid problems. I ordered the dump truck salad with no tomatoes and the dressing on the side. The vegetables were so fresh and full of flavor, that I never ended up even touching my dressing! It was so spectacular that I'm having difficulty gagging down this bagged salad from the grocery store as I write this review.  I also ordered the house made charcuterie, pickles and bread. The server was kind enough to make sure that I had bread without cheese or tomatoes to meet my needs. He even replaced the butter with a fabulous mustard that really enhanced the meats. My favorite of the evening was what I believe they called the hunter sausage. It made me break into my \"happy food dance!\" The spices were complex and not over powering. Some of the pickled items were a bit of a single note, and probably could benefit from some added dill, onions, or garlic in the brine. But the sweet pickles were the best I've had, and I'm usually not a fan."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. Two of my favorite foods, right in the name!  But, alas. Went there for lunch today. Three occupied tables  in the whole place (what does that tell you?). Asked to split a $14 cuban sandwich, with two sides, NBD. Sandwich is delivered to the table on one plate. I ask the foodrunner/server if the chef will split it for us. Waiter sniffs, and says, \"That's what THAT is for!\" and nods at a steak knife on the table. Really? Saunters back and leaves our food in the open window until the cook can be found to cut it in half.  Unfortunately, it kind of went downhill from there. The Cuban had sweet pickles and not the expected dill. Had they been really good, it would have been NP. But this was a serious mound (as much as the meat) and we both had to pull them off. Over- dressed mustardy buns (and I love mustard too), a blandly dressed salad (too bad, the veggies were fresh), and the star of lunch - two potato \"tots\" - the whole experience averaged out to a really mediocre lunch. Even the dill pickle served on the plate was so vinegary tart I had to spit it out. And I love vinegar!   Between the snotty food runner (our main server was good) the disappointing mashup of my favorite foods, and pricey lunch menu, I won't be back. I'll get my pig and pickle fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"When it initially opened I gave it three stars.  It's been 4 or 5 stars since that time with a changing menu and great service.  Recently we had a group of eight dine there.  About half the people got sick.  It must have been one of the starter plates.  We had the salmon (one of our favorites), charcuterie and cheese plates. Nothing tasted off.   I'll still go there because the food, drinks and service are great, but I'm wondering who else got sick?"}
{"text":"Bone marrow was interesting, not sure I would order it again as it tasted like eating a large chuck of fat.  The staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Service is slow. Forgot to refill waters. The pork marrow was pricey and disappointing. Pork liver was ok. The pork tostada literally smelled like my friends dirty Great Dane. It was very unpleasant . My entree was pulled pork sandwich and was also disappointing . It had too much melted oily cheese and too much bread. This place could put less serving on plates. Too much food that tastes bad."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, and it will now be on my list of favorites for Phoenix.  Worth the 20 minute drive from my hotel.  AYUP!  Drive from wherever you are to this restaurant while you're in the are.  Bacon flight?  Yes!  The ambience is casual.  The menu is spectacularly unique.  I've never had a breakfast like fried Brussels sprouts with an egg on top.  But it was one of the best breakfast meals I've ever had.  The fresh cut bacon on the side made this a meal to die for.  Go for breakfast, can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything from drinks to dessert was full of whimsy and flavor.   Our cocktails were handcrafted and unique.   The bone marrow app was unexpectedly tasty.  The duck breast was a perfect medium rare with great flavor.  The hangar steak was tender and flavorful. In my perfect world, it could have used a pinch of salt.   The triple chocolate cheesecake was a perfect compliment to the french press coffee.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Happy hour 4-6 pm with three wines, four beers and 8 appetizers.  Ordered the beer cheese dip with pickled veggies and jalepenos. Very good with just a slight kick.  Ordered roasted Brussels sprouts as an accompaniment tony main course of shrimp and grits.  Very good and eclectic menu. Food was very good!"}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place for a while so I met a friend here for lunch. I arrived first and sat at the bar for a while before I received service. Finally someone approached me and asked me if I was there for a job as the bartender. I said no but spent the entire lunch wondering what about me looked jobless. I thought it was funny and really has nothing to do with my rating.   Decent selection of beer on tap, I had a delicious IPA.  I ordered a burger with a fancy name & aioli mayo or some bullshit like that but it was basically a patty with bacon on top. It wasn't good at all, I only took a few bites but what I did eat sat in my stomach and made me feel gross all day.  The service never really got better but there was a speedy and fun glam guy working the patio that made me wish we would have moved out there once my buddy arrived.    I've wanted to give them another try but I associate the place with the gross feeling now and can't force myself to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by this past Wednesday night after looking up the menu online. It looks like they have a very extensive bar, and the cocktail menu seemed well thought out to match the ambiance. Started off with the street corn. Very simple, and tasty with the perfect amount of spice. Ordered the apocalypse sow. It was a bit overwhelming and messy but I found it to be very enjoyable when I broke it down and ate it with a fork and knife. I was glad I ordered the tots with the meal. They change daily but mine were panko crusted with a mashed potato and sausage filling. Delicious. The service was excellent and the owner was there greeting the guests which is always a good sign. I really enjoyed my time here and would definitely come back next time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I have to say, normally I love this place, but today the pork belly is off, and if you're going to braise pork belly, you have to do it right every time. Half it is still on the plate b/c the fat is chewy and inedible. For pork belly novices, it should melt in your mouth. Customers shouldn't be gagging on it. This is especially true for a restaurant that prides itself on its  pork offerings. My boyfriend and I agree, this pork belly hurt our hearts."}
{"text":"This was so NOT what we were expecting. We truly expected a quaint little pub bistro feel with some great food. Hmmmm.   First off, the music is quite loud and the tables in the dining area were so high up, they come up to almost level with our chins. The waiter came by to make his suggestions. They were definitely his! AND we just couldn't hear each other. The waiter suggested giving us the tomato salad as an appetizer. I understood him to say it would be an appetizer \"size\". Then I finally ordered a \"Nancy\" sandwich. I thought it was a burger given the price and the location on the menu.   I was WRONG  on both counts.    The salad came and seemed appetizer size. NOPE. It was a hefty $14.50 for a small bed of arugula and a few slices of heirloom and cherry tomatoes topped with cream fresh. Then the \"Nancy\" came. I guess I read the menu wrong as it was listed under MAIN plates. Instead, I got a Brie sandwich with two slivers of avocado, onion, tomato, and a small garden salad. My partner couldn't eat the Brie. She said it was tainted. I ate about half.   When the waiter came back, I politely told him I thought our Nancy was a burger. He said: Oh no! I just thought you two were the Vegetarian types. He smiled and left. What??? ....BUT IF that were true, what are we doing going to \"Pig & Pickle\"?!?!?!?  Also, I was just shocked at the $13.50 charge for a cheese sandwich and $14.50 for a small rather simple tomato salad. The waiter insisted it came with a fresh baked roll and freshly made pickles. BTW They could keep the pickles. They were on the sweet side with some odd mixture of spices. Neither of us liked them at all.   Just feel it was a pricey experience."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I've been here several times and tried their sandwiches, salads, and pork belly! They smoke all their meats in house and you can taste the quality.  They have great drinks - I love the Bramble On and #ScottsdaleProblems (lol). They have a large selection of beers, too.  Every time I've gone there, the service was friendly and prompt. The menu is a bit tricky, with lots of fancy things I've never heard of, so the waiter had to explained our options and also suggested their favorites.  On a side note, this is probably not the best restaurant to take a vegetarian or vegan. Our friend only had a few options - fried brussel spouts (yum) and a couple of salads."}
{"text":"came with a friend to try out their HH menu - we ordered the tostadas, the banh mi, the broccoli cheddar soup, and the chedder cheese dip. while good, all of these dishes were variations of the same thing! i was also a wee bit late, so the food was lukewarm :/  the tostadas had a nice twist - pulled pork topped with house made kimchi! it was good, and i recommend this dish! the banh mi was a HEAPING assortment of pork on pork on pork - it was not my fave and i do love me some banh mi. it was just very meat heavy, and could have used a little more acidity and some veggies etc to add some more depth.   the broccoli cheddar soup was very very thick and very very cheddary and LOADED with bacon. it was good, but super heavy.  the cheese dip was kinda the same thing, but with a spicy kick and no broccoli or bacon. out of the 2, i'd recommend the dip.   at this point, we were WAY too full to attempt anything else, but decided we'd be back to try the sandwiches and entrees. so far, the food is a solid 3.   but to top off our dinner, we decided to get a dessert - the seared carrot cake. probably the best carrot cake i've ever had? it's lush and perfectly spiced, topped with the most amazing whipped goat cheese, fried carrot chips, and black pepper caramel, with a sprinkling of white raisins. to die for. i would probably come here just for this. the dessert is worthy of 5 stars - rounding this review to a 4."}
{"text":"Amazing food and booze experience! Can't wait to come back!!  Perfect service and perfect music/vibes!"}
{"text":"This place is a great example of what a gastropub should be.  Nice decor, friendly and knowledgeable servers, good food and drinks.  I was here Saturday and enjoyed my experience.  The cocktails were well made and quite reasonably priced at $8-9.  My Sidecar was great.  I'd like to see a little more selection for the wines by the glass.  The duck ham salad was a nice start.  I really liked the duck tostada with kimchee and the tri tip was perfect.  An extra bonus was observing the hipster patrons with their little hats and skinny pants.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Dog friendly patio! Double awesome. The food was absolutely fantastic. I nibbled on a few items and was very impressed with the quality. Everything a pork lover could want. They even brought my dog a home-made peanut butter bacon treat! Excellent beer selection and the patio. Our server was Ashley and she was very attentive and made great recommendations on IPA's. I was really stoked when she split up our check even when we had split entire dishes she broke each check down to exactly what we had! You had me at bacon jelly. Awesome."}
{"text":"What a great little find!  The pork belly starter was my choice for a meal and it didn't disappoint. Good food, good atmosphere and good drinks!  Really what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I signed up for Yelp just so I can write a review on this restaurant!!  There is not a month that goes by where I am not in some other large US city having  a nice meal and I have to say that the Pig & Pickle competes toe to toe.  This will for sure be a Top 20 Phoenix-Metro Restaurant!  I am already planning on being back in a few days.  Awesome service, great personalities with the staff, cool atmosphere, great drinks and absolutely ridiculously yummy food.  It has the friendliness of the Mid-West, a feel of a Kansas City steak restaurant, an eclectic menu of a San Francisco hot spot, and the cozy atmosphere of a Cheers bar.  Do yourself a favor and just go!!"}
{"text":"Started with charcuterie, pickles and bread. It was interesting and most of it very good! I didn't appreciate the snout but two old Scottsdale bags seemed to enjoy a good snout every now and then... The pork porterhouse was slightly overdone, teetering seriously close to dry. Scott was a great bartender and very attentive.. The food was good but not 'go out of your way' good. I probably should have ordered something different..."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I'm NEVER the type to complain or even take the time to log into Yelp to share my opinion unless it's an awesome review but this deserves to be known. My good friend decided he wanted to try Pig & Pickle as he had been referred to the restaurant by a fellow KCCO-er. He knew that taking me there may be a stretch as I am a self proclaimed \"5 year old eater\" but what the heck he thought. When we sat down we weren't greeted right away by our waiter but no biggie. When he did come over he asked if we had ever been there and when we said no he did a good job at explaining the culture of the restaurant and the food (cool!) Once he went to actually take our order things went down hill. I ordered first and I half jokingly asked if they had a kids menu because for me the menu was a little out there (sorry for the foodies out there (including my friend) I'm sure I'm an embarrassment ;)) I mean c'mon he didn't even crack a smile at that he just looked at me like I was an idiot and said no. I then proceeded to order the burger and when I asked for pickles (it is in the name after all) he said \"It will come with a pickle on the side but not on the burger\" I then ordered the fries as the side and he very condescendingly said \"already knew that!\" My friend proceeded to order all the wonderful things he saw on the menu and the waiter was much more responsive and welcoming to him. Once we received our appetizer, the waiter came back and proceeded to talk to my friend about the secret menu and even showed him a picture on his phone of a specialty burger so obviously this waiter takes his food seriously. Which by the way I respect totally but throughout the rest of the meal the waiter completely ignored me and only acknowledged my friend. It really made me feel like he was punishing me because I ordered the burger (which so did my friend!) but I'm just not the adventurous eater...sue me! Even my friend noticed and said I feel like I'm eating by myself because he is blantantly ignoring you. I felt so uncomfortable the entire time I was there which was disappointing because my friend was enjoying his meal but not the service. So word to the wise...if you don't like to be too adventurous with your meal choices I would not recommend this place but if you are...you'd really enjoy it since the owners are actually the cooks (pretty cool!) So there's my two cents...if you get the server by the name of Sean (which I only found out because it was on the bill the I paid) beware...he may hurt your view of this potentially awesome restaurant. I will end on a good note to say the rest of the staff was much more friendly but there's definitely a bad apple."}
{"text":"We were in search of late night eats after flying into PHX at 9:30 since most non fast food places close around 10.  The name immediately caught my eye as pork and pickles are things I love to eat.  We arrived  around 11 pm.  There were a few patrons dining inside and at the bar as well as outside on the patio.  The late night menu was a good size as were looking for a light meal.  We ordered the tot of the day.  It's more of a potato croquette, but for $1, it's absolutely worth getting 1 per person.  The aioli had a nice spice and flavor to it.  We ordered the pickled things and our faves were the grapes and beets.  We dipped the pickled egg in the aioli.  I think that combo would make an awesome pickled deviled egg or pickled egg salad sandwich.  The liver and caramelized onion smear on toast was tasty, especially if you are a pâté fan.  The smear had an interesting smoky taste.  At $4, it's a steal. My bf had the burger and fries.  He said the burger was good but nothing special.  I ordered the shrimp and grits.  The portion size was large.  It wasn't what I expected.  It was more like a shrimp, sausage, and tomato stew on top of grits.  It was too spicy for my taste, but the cheesy grits had me going back for more as I wanted every last bit of grits.  I would have been happy with mostly grits and a few sautéed shrimp.  Overall, the meal was excellent.  With tax and tip, the 2 of us were well fed for $40."}
{"text":"I've heard lots of good thugs about pig and pickle so I had to try it out. My family went in for a cocktail after a dinner last Saturday night. The waiters were all really nice, and accommodating. We had a larger group, so that they pushed tables together right away. Everyone was impressed with their drink, but mine was the best by far! I highly recommend the cilantro margarita! It was the best margarita I've ever had, hands down! Another thing I had to try (but wasn't quite as impressed with) was the bone marrow. I knew I wanted to try it, but it wasn't easy to eat. I definitely don't regret trying it tho. The serving was huge! (Which I was glad for because it was $16) if everyone just had 1 or 2 bites, you could share this between 8! For us, 1 or 2 bites was good enough when you are eating what tastes like pure fat haha. But they kicker was at the end... you can get \"the ludge!\" They pour a shot of bourbon down the empty bone you just ate all the marrow out of! It was actually tasty and lots of fun! Great experience!"}
{"text":"From out of town and stopped in because Yelp reviewed it highly. Ordered the P&P Club with salad! I inhaled it! It was delicious and just what I was looking for! the food was presented very nicely and the price was right! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Service is terrible.  Had to ask to be seated.  As servers stood around talking with customers about wine and food, i waited 10-15 minutes before someone finally asked if anyone had helped me.  That person then went over and pulled my server away from a conversation that had been going on since i had been seated.  Finally placed my order.  After a substantial wait, a chef came out with my meal and asked if i would like him to describe it for me.  After declining, i ate the mediocre entrée', paid my check and left.  I have dined in 5 star restaurants around the world.  This place needs to remember two things.  1. EVERY customer counts.  2. They are next to a Crazy Howie's Pizza in a strip mall, not in The Biltmore.  Service and food are mediocre at best.  Substantially overpriced!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I fell in love with this place. The owner and the waitress we had were such sweethearts and THEY'RE DOG FRIENDLY! We had an amazing experience there."}
{"text":"What a great place! Great environment! Great food! Great drinks! I would recommend this place to anyone in the south Scottsdale area. Don't wait \"just do it\" lol"}
{"text":"Perhaps my expectations of this restaurant were what led to a disappointing experience.  We were seated on the patio and greeted fairly quickly by our server,  however the hostess had forgotten to give us a drink menu so we had to send our server away until we could figure out a beverage. After that,  out server came around very rarely and didn't have much personality.    We like to try house cocktails,  and ordered two of their specialty drinks;  mine was decent (a pig and pickle take on an old fashioned) but my husband's was gross. He ordered one of their aged cocktails and it was so sweet he couldn't finish it. After that, we stuck to wine.   For dinner we ordered a pork burger and shrimp and grits. My husband's burger was really good,  but my dish was disappointing.  The menu didn't disclose that the shrimp and grits would be buried under a mess of sauce (some sort of tomato sauce I believe). The shrimp didn't seem to be seasoned at all, and were few and far between. The Andouille sausage overpowered the dish."}
{"text":"All three dishes were good. The easy over egg on Brussel sprouts and asiago cheese was delish, a perfect healthy and enjoyable brunch. Wow the crispy skin trout was very good too. The udon noodle meal was tasty but my 3rd fav of the morning. The staff is very standoffish especially on a slow and quiet day(service 3). I'll be back for the food but I hope the attitude improves."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of this place - meat and pickles, sour and sweet, everything made in-house.  Even the drink names are great.  Pig & pickle has a bit of an identity crisis though.  It's like casual pizzeria meets upscale gastro pub combined with anything pig related.  On the walls you'll find local art you can purchase and on the bar shelf you'll see are two plastic pigs humping.     The servers are very knowledgeable about food and are quite helpful, yet the bartenders goof around as if they are coffee baristas.  The drink menu's are awesome and the food choices are some of my favorite.  Unfortunately while the menu looks great, the food fails to deliver.  Love bone marrow - just not here.  It could have used some more time and the whatever bread crumb topping just didn't go.  In-house chorizo - nice touch - but I've had better at breakfast joints.  I really wanted to give this place 4 stars because it's the kind of place I like.  Underwhelming food made me want to give it 2 stars.  The charcuterie was great though - variety of meats and pickles - that deserves a star in itself."}
{"text":"If you're trying to go HAM for happy hour, go to Pig & Pickle. I had the rosé $5, well I had several... it was so good! Also ordered the Mac and cheese (added bacon) and tacos on happy hour both $5 (so cheap!) OMG the mac and cheese had WAY too much bacon.... said no one ever. The tacos where pork, obvi, and had just the right amount of spice. P & P has that mom and pop feel with the quality of a five star restaurant. Perfect place to pig out."}
{"text":"It really has become a favorite spot of mine. I am shocked and amazed they had fiddleheads when they had them.... they were delicious... the hanger steak and chimmichurri? Delucious! I love that the menu changes because it allows not only for seasonal items but awesome surprises as well.  It's almost like you get a present when the menu changes.. i like presents :-)   The Mississippi mud pie chocolate,  oh my goodness its so chocolate, is really good these days too.... although, that carrot cake? mmmmmm.... (not so awesome deconstructed in a to-go box), but even then still my fave... with mild peppery goodness, caramel whatever goatcheese frosting...  I always also enjoy the music playing ever so faintly in the background,  Tribe Called Quest, some Heiro, some Wu, some Bob, Blackalicious, Diagble Planets, J5, sometimes there's live music....   I dig.   Yup, I think Pig & Pickle makes my soul feel good."}
{"text":"Actually my 1st time is today & I have to say...  WoW, Awsome.  We had the House Made Charcuterie.   If you like smoke flavor in your food & don't mind some picked veggies with it. You will be  in Heaven w/this platter."}
{"text":"You haven't been?   GO!   The sooner the better!  How is that for a short Review? Been at least a dozen times and have eaten from ALL of their Menus (which do change periodically). Have NEVER been disappointed. The must haves:  * Pork Shoulder Tostadas (FABULOUS!) * Charcuterie (Always a treat and some surprises - pickled grapes? Delicious) * Duck - NOT Pig, but generally wonderful! * Vinegar Pie (usually combined with a fruit like Strawberry) MAGICAL!  Certainly has become one of my favorites and open late night or early morning, depending on your schedule. I BET IT WILL BECOME ONE OF YOUR FAVORITES AS WELL!"}
{"text":"The food here is unreal, that apocalypse sow burger is a taste of the heavens. Also late night menu till 1am, can't beat that. Also the udon noodles are to die for. Even though the location could be better, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"The roasted Brussels Sprouts were life changing. I am addicted. The drinks were great & the food was delicious. Very pleased with this being my choice for new restaurant of the week! Loved my server, very knowledgeable. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Definitely not a preferred restaurant of mine. I came here one about a year ago and had poor service and unappetizing food. The server took an incredibly long time to get our drinks out and take our orders and then because we had a party of 8 he included 22% gratuity to our bill which was unheard of to me and everyone I was with and for the service and food we had gotten we were upset. My fish was drenched in oil and butter to a point where it was like a soup that my meal was steeping in. Definitely won't be coming back here any time soon."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. All the food is made from scratch using local farmers and ranchers the place is clean and they play good music. Everything on the menu is excellent. It's the type of food that will wake sleeping taste buds. The Pig and Pickle sets the bar for good food."}
{"text":"I go to the Pig & Pickle all of the time and it's a must to take friends to when they are visiting out of town.  My go to's are having an order of the pork tostadas and the brussel sprouts(do they just call them sprouts in Brussels?) as an appetizer and then I have one of their specialty big plates depending on what is new... with a delicious old fashioned.   Many of the staff have been there for a long time which is always something that I look for as a trait of an amazing restaurant.   Even my friends who don't like pork or pickles like this place.   You should go today... and next week too.   You wont regret it."}
{"text":"After hearing about the creative and delicious dishes at Pig & Pickle and learning about the Chefs' commitment to local produce, handcrafted cocktails, homegrown herbs, and fresh baked breads, I was excited to finally visit P&P to celebrate a friend's birthday.   Our server, Cat, was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She was encouraging of us trying new things without being \"pushy\" which was quite refreshing. We ordered a round of cocktails and everyone was quite pleased with the humorously named drinks: \"Red Headed Stepchild\" (which came with a Sour Patch Kid!), \"Salty Dog\" (vodka, black/white hawaiian sea salts, fresh grapefruit) and the \"Maggie\" (homemade triple-sec and Hawaiian Sun strawberry/passionfruit juice - delicious but not too sweet). I ordered the \"Bramble On\" (gin, blackberry, lime juice, soda) because it sounded creative and refreshing, but since I'm not a \"gin girl\" I didn't find it quite as tasty as the other drinks.   The favorite appetizers that the group tried were the Pork Belly Tostadas ($9 for two large tostadas) and the Fried Brussels Sprouts with Asiago and a Farm Fresh Egg ($7). The Butternut Squash Soup with toasted pepitas was so delicious that I was glad that I had a small bowl for myself that I didn't have to share!   A specialty item on the menu tonight was Trotter Stuffed with Fennel Sausage. \"Pied de Cochon,\" as this delicacy is known in France, is French for Pigs' Trotters or Pigs' Feet - yep, feet! Not surprisingly, this part is typically thrown away by butchers, but apparently this can be quite appetizing when it's prepared correctly (bones removed, cooked for hours, etc.). I don't love pork, so I passed on the opportunity to try this dish. The meat-lovers in the group tried the stuffed trotter and were disappointed that it wasn't quite as tender as expected, though they raved about the fennel sausage and the raspberry sauce that accompanied the dish. Our server noticed that most of the dish was left untouched and when she heard it wasn't quite as expected, she apologized and took it off our bill.   The main dishes were the the show stoppers of the night! The Golden Beet Salad ($9) was artfully presented and deliciously prepared with candied pecans, watercress, bleu cheese crema, and pomegranate seeds. The sandwiches or \"sammies\" come with your choice of fries, small \"dump truck\" salad, or tots for an extra $1. With all the other appetizers, two people split the \"Nancy\" (brie, avocado, tomato and shaved red onion on garlic rubbed bread) and were quite satisfied with the sammie and salad.   The birthday girl selected the \"Chocolate Mud Cake\" for dessert, which was beautifully presented with a candle and chocolate garnish on the side. The chocolate cake was moist, rich and delicious with a hint of sea salt that was nicely paired with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream.   After a fun birthday celebration that excited our taste buds, I'd love to come back to P&P to sample more of the menu and enjoy the happy hour pricing (4-6 pm daily)."}
{"text":"My friend was raving about their menu so after a late night out on the town, we got there at 1:05am and unfortunately the kitchen closed at 1am.  We didn't make a big fuss cause well, it was 1am in the morning, we were not going to make anyone cook for us so late/early in the day! So my friend and I both had a cocktail each~ he had the manhattan martini and I had some drink for which I cannot remember but they were both well presented and delicious~ full of subtle flavor! The name Pig & Pickle is so deceiving since if I heard the name without coming to the joint, I would expect a hole in the wall BBQ place.  But I see from the many reviews this place has already received, the word is out that this place is a foodie heaven and a cool place to hang out. I will be back again, this time before the 1am gong hour so that I can try out their menu along with more of their delicious, libacious cocktails!"}
{"text":"What's Pig & Pickle?  A hip restaurant that keeps tapping on something new and that they do.  I had been here a few times and they always have something new in their menu. Pork Belly and Bone Marrow are so sinful but after taking a bite I feel like I'm in heaven! So delicious! Mac n' Cheese is awesome! Talking about desserts like strawberry vinegar pie  and pumpkin bread pudding are such a delicious treats!"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here! Their 'tots' are delish and not like any normal tator tot you would get at another restaurant. They were large, fried mashed potato balls - you only get two with your meal (and a $1.50 additional charge) but they were well worth it. The only small complaint I have is regarding their alcohol. We ordered bloody Mary's and they left a bit to be desired, but were still on the pricey side. Next time, I'd probably just settle for a beer. Otherwise, great food, great atmosphere, and the host- who I think must have been the owner - was really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while visiting for spring training and was not disappointed. Started off with the beet salad which fresh and light. For the main course I had their pork burger which was delicious and full of flavor. Wrapped it up with the most amazing cookies and creme brûlée. Service was great and our waiter was super helpful with recommendations and explanations for how things were prepared. Will definitely be telling others to stop by here and hopefully will drop by again next spring."}
{"text":"New to Scottsdale (3rd day.) Los Angeles eater. Blown away. Everything about this restaurant clicks, from the service to the presentation. Of course the food is great, why else would I be writing?   What strikes me is their commitment to their craft. They are brave in their offerings; dishes that aren't your standard fate, but mouthwatering nonetheless.  I appreciate restaurants that aren't afraid to push the envelope, all while sourcing responsibly and with quality in mind.  The food? I've eaten twice. You have to try the charcuterie plate. Insane. House made.  The Cuban pickle crisis looked picturesque when served and exploded in my mouth. Their salad was the best I've had and I don't even like salad or the idea of fruits and nuts in it. Go figure.  Try it. Blame me if you don't like Pig & Pickle."}
{"text":"We had our corporate holiday party here last night and it BLEW US AWAY!!! The owners and staff are on top of their game. The service was impeccable, the food surpassed my expectations, and the drinks were scrumptious. The two owners take pride in their work and it is evident. My office will not stop talking about how amazing the party was last night. PS- our company is in the restaurant industry so we are kind of food snobs and you guys NAILED IT!!! I would highly recommend Pig and Pickle for lunch, dinner, or any private dining event...you will not regret it. Thanks again guys...you rock!!!"}
{"text":"I came for dinner on Tuesday, and had a server named Sean (aka Science Rocket on the receipt), who provided possibly the worst service I've had to date at a restaurant. From the second he brought our table waters it was clear he didn't want to be serving me and the one other person I was with.  Once I ordered my entree he was immediately upset with my decision. He began arguing with me about what I should order instead, and started insulting me for not trying one of the entrees unique to the restaurant. Once he realized how rude he was acting he tried to make up for it by saying, \"I'm not trying to be a dick.\" I cant think of a more unprofessional phrase you can say to two people who you are supposed to be serving.  I am not easily offended, but he talked down to my table like we were idiots for having preferences outside of his own. The person I was with got the \"Apocalypse Sow\"  pork burger and it was not worth the $7, let alone the $15 they charge. The meal I ordered, which caused Sean such frustration, was the fish and chips. They weren't bad, but judging with my server's opinion of them Pig & Pickle should probably take them off the menu and stick to what he likes.  I will not be back, but my suggestion to anyone who decides to go would be if you have Sean as a server don't order something he doesn't like or you might anger him."}
{"text":"This is our second visit. We celebrated my birthday this evening. Lamb chops with chimchurri, pork belly with sweet potato purée. Need I say more?  P&P is the top of the heap in Scottsdale dining. Ashley, our server, is also on the top of her game. Very professional. For dessert. The Elvis. Peanut butter cheesecake with strawberries caramelized bananas and bacon."}
{"text":"I've watched five restaurants go under in this same location. However, Pig & Pickle is the only restaurant that seem to figure it out. Best place ever!!! I would recommend everyone to go there. Staff is amazing. Food is great. If you want a tasty burger, this is the place to be. For the most part, the Owners are of a kind. They make everyone feel like their at home. This business will last a lifetime because of them and the staff they provide."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars but for a few little glitches. Service was outstanding & the food was nearly perfect but for a few inconsistencies- too few broccoli in 1 soup & too much in another.  There were unopened clams & tons of celery in the clams. Besides that we loved the tots and the bone marrow. I've had marrow many times, including in France, and this was my favorite preparation. Luscious! Other favorites were the burgers, brisket, and steak. I loved the salad too. The beer list was exceptional but they only had 6 wines by the glass. All the desserts were wonderful. Favorites were the Elvis & the chocolate cake. We can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a light dinner with two girl friends. I've heard about this restaurant and have been meaning to go, so I was so excited to check it out.  The decor is super cute - dim lighting with an inviting bar and pig signs/pictures/designs everywhere - loved it! But the food was even better. We ordered just a few small plates to share. The pork belly (umm, yum! perfectly cooked and delicious tender and flavorful), the pork shoulder tostatas (they come 2 to an order and are piled high with shredded pork) and the shrimp & grits.  We had that kind of service where you don't notice they are there, but your water cup is always full and the empty plates are always promptly removed.   Loved it! I will be coming back here as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, good food, great whiskey selection, friendly servers and bartenders  Bone marrow: bomb diggity Veggie Supper: so flavorful and earthy! really great textures Beet Salad: refreshing and light  Loved it both times I've been here."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere inside and I really enjoyed the hip-hop music that was playing. The hot wings were great and the sauce tasted like they made it in-house. The poutine was tasty in the spots where the fries soaked it up, but the fries near the outer edges were too crunchy and dry. Drink menu is a bit confusing with all the strange names. I had a smokey flavored drink which was okay and cost $8.   This place has potential once I find my favorite side dish and drink to go with the awesome hot wings."}
{"text":"We tried the pork belly. Albondagas soup and the broccoli cheese soup. The were all very good. I did not realize the soup came in two sizes. $5 was the small. Wish I had gotten the large but I just ate some of hubbies pork belly, wishing I had ordered some of my own. Pork belly and soup were enough for a good meal unless you are a big eater."}
{"text":"This restaurant is totally cute, hip, trendy, loud, and fun - I am just not sure if the raving yelp reviews lived up to my expectations. I came here specifically to try the brussel sprouts - I am a total fan of brussel sprouts. I decided to go on my yelp app to see what else I can try.  We came on a Friday night - around 9pm. There was a crowd of people and live music! Yay, live music. We sat down right away and the server wasn't that friendly, but didn't mind. I ordered the funktional drink and it was really strong. I guess it would be a really good drink if you are out with friends, talking the night away because this one drink can totally get you \"happy\".   We ordered the pork belly, the fried brussel sprouts, and the stuffed tater tots. All were very tasty. However, I guess for someone who cooks almost every day and can make restaurant quality food (patting myself on the back), including some bomb brussel sprouts, I wasn't wowed. The alcoholic drinks though, I would come back for especially if I want to forget my problems."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. We went in at about 11pm, and the service was fast, but the burger took ages to come out. The rest of our party had the hot dog and fries and finished their meal before the burger even made it to the table. The bacon in the burger was also chewy rather than crisp which made it difficult to eat.   Waiter was really nice, and the one alcoholic drinks our table ordered was well made."}
{"text":"Pig & Pickle, how you make me so happy!  This is my go to spot. The food is delicious and the staff is pretty good.  As someone who works in the industry I like that they stay open late to accomodate the night shift people.  Bf and I came here a long time ago based on yelp reviews and we've been coming back time and time again.  We've tried almost everything on the regular menu. Unfortunately, since our schedules have changed we haven't been able to enjoy the after 10pm menu in awhile.  You cant go wrong with the pork liver smear, bone marrow, and the newer pork belly starters.  The burger, hanger steak, and duck are amazing as well.  Large selection of beers and signature cocktails (with a good twist on some classics).  I think they make their own flavored bourbon, too.  I highly recommend this place. I've recommended it to people many times already."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat and drink. Service is great and the owner Clayton is super helpful. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Good if you love Salt! The salt to dollar ratio is here is off the charts.  The automatic gratuity was a nice touch as well!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  I usually get my drinks from Scottie but today Shea showed off his magical drink mixology and I was not disappointed.  The food was divine as well, with Matt offering to box up my leftovers in his most manly of ways.  Ladies...visit these hotties for your drinks and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"They cure their own meat, pickle locally procured veggies, bake their own bread. Everything we ordered tasted delicious (actually the bread was just ok) - a charcuterie plate, and Brussel sprouts with bacon. The service was delightful.  If you are a vegetarian or do not eat pork, you would be a petty idiot to come here and then complain you didn't get what you want. Thats like going to Walmart and complaining they don't have Louis Vuitton.."}
{"text":"Pig and Pickle's website says it best!   \"...don't call us one dimensional....the idea behind the brand is all about balance. sweet needs sour...chocolate needs salt...we support local when possible, small farmers, happy animals, real sugar, real fat... we hand craft our cocktails, bake our bread daily, make our own aioli and grow our own herbs....\"  This is just the kind of place you want to venture to for great cocktails, great bites, or an indulgent dinner.  Happy hour here is a fantastic way to familiarize yourself with their toothsome menu.  Featured are $5 Pupus such as the incomparable  \"Dump Truck Salad with mixed lettuces (spring greens such as arugula and spinach), radish sprouts, fresh mint, baby shaved veggies like radish, cauliflower, cucumber, carrots, cherry tomato, sesame seeds, shaved fennel, chia, flax seed, and all doused with a wonderful cucumber and shallot vinaigrette, dusted with sea salt and cracked pepper.  Incredible!  You can also enjoy the likes of Creamy Broccoli and Brown Ale Soup, or a selection of the Chef's housemade charcuterie, all for $5 during HH which is 4-6p Daily.  The menu does change seasonally, so there are items such as the Crispy Chicken Tacos with Sriracha Aioli and slaw that may not always be on the menu.  With a name like \"Pig and Pickle, I was unsurprised to find the chicken tacos lackluster.  Chicken was breaded and consequently dry and flavorless.  It would have been a great taco if the meat was rotisserie or marinated.  The aioli was wonderful, just the right amount of kick balanced by the cool of the red cabbage.    However!  The Pork liver and Caramelized Onion Smear, with pickled fennel and an apple raisin mustardo was exquisite.  It had a wonderfully smoky flavor, and the Hawaiian sea salt gave it so much more character.  Highly recommended for pate lovers.  Personally, I thought this plate was great without the pickled fennel or the mustardo - just the amazing sea salt.  The Wood Oven Roasted Bone Marrow came last, served with Crostini  and caramelized onions.  It tasted like a decadent and savory sweetbread butter, and it is no wonder why it is a staple here at P&P.  Drinks! With names like Salty Dog and the Stoney Baloney, you are in for a unique treat.  The Stoney had a unique melange of Hophead vodka, fresh lime, grapefruit juice, hop grapefruit bitters, an IPA float, and candied lemon rind.  The Salty dog their own version of the \"Greyhound\" with Hawaiian sea salts.  Although I did not venture into sampling the Dinner menu, I spied several tasty looking dishes such as Pork Porchetta and Mussels in White Wine.  With great service and equally great dishes, I am definitely coming back here for more!"}
{"text":"Ive been here for lunch twice and have not been disappointed. There is plenty of parking and it's a nice looking facility. The staff are pleasant and knowledgeable about there eclectic menu and extensive list of beers. There are daily soup and sandwich specials. On my last visit I had a bagel with lox and it was hugh and was only about $9. It is large enough to share or provide another meal at home. My friend is still raving about their soups. We've been here twice and I can guarantee that we will return."}
{"text":"5 Stars....food, staff, vibe, location...such a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Phenomenal."}
{"text":"After taking another couple to the Pig's brunch last Sunday, I have been thinking about returning to the place for a specific  menu item....prime rib. I'm usually an omnivore if the food is done well. I have not been shy about sharing the places that do all food justice. Tonight, Peg and I returned to the P&P because we knew that the aforementioned prime rib was on the menu. OMG!  If you are tired of things that some restaurants try to do to this product via rubs, coatings, or anything else that is NOT just your basic wonderful cut ofmeat, then you really need to check the version that Keenan, Josh and crew serve. It is, IMHO, the best in the Valley hands down!!. Deliciously rare-med rare, a twice-baked with broccoli and the wonderfulness of a good potato, and the bet-you-can-only-eat- half verision of what tasted like the oldtime Parker House dinner roll. Peg's scallops and corn combo were amazing, and we started with splitting a bánh mì sandwich and a bowl of gazpacho...both on the great happy hour menu as well. Thank God we 86'd the wedge salad!  The bánh mì was incredbile....and it will be split (with a dump truck salad, perhaps) for an entire  dinner next time. BTW..dipping the sandwich IN the gazpacho is a bit of heaven in and of itself. At any rate....this meal was memorable. Yet again, Chris, Kat, and the always efficient servers were filling water glasses and being attentive. The more we go to this place....the better it gets!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"Over a two-week period have been here about 5 times. Happy hour features $5 mixed drinks which are great... try the \"pain killer\" or \"gin & juice\" as the menus rotate; $5 'Happy Hour items include: an 'adult' mac & cheese (with queso blanco, pepper jack & green chilies) came in a hot iron pan - fantastic! And pork tacos that are small but very very good . Dinner with friends we had the grilled bavette (steak) which was perfectly cooked, and accentuated by the  gorgonzola fondue; walnuts & cranberries are addictive; tiny purple potatoes were okay but I would have preferred mashed and I prefer mushrooms on the side or not at all. Brussel sprouts wuth added bacon is simply to die for. Children's Mac & cheese was Kraft level so we sent it back and Ricky exchanged it for grilled cheese with steak fries  and that was much better. I'll be coming back again the next time in town!"}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday Funday brunch, mimosas, and bloody marys.  A big group of us from out-of-town arrived a little after they opened at ten.  We enjoyed the bloody sconnie - vodka, house made bloody mix, lime & a beer back.  I think I had three of them!  A few of us (including myself) ordered the p&p benedict - roasted pork, sunny up eggs, english muffin, cholula hollandaise.  I added bacon...*drool*.  It was so delicious!  My friends enjoyed the pork belly, too, of course.  I'd definitely go back the next time I'm visiting Scottsdale.  Many other fun drink and food combinations to try!"}
{"text":"Everything pickled and everything pork!  Try the charcuterie!  The bread is flavorful and fresh, and trying everything else on the plate is a veritable adventure.  The croque Monsieur is among the most delicious things I've ever tasted, and the worst part of dessert is narrowing your choices down to one!  The cookie was amazing, and next time I'll be trying the chocolate cake.  Seriously, any restaurant that offers pork belly as a side is a foodie dream.  Beer selection was small, but interesting and good."}
{"text":"very tasty food and generous portion size. Efficient and pleasant staff. My spouse enjoyed an excellent beer. This was our second visit and we went for \"restaurant week\" It was a very pleasant dinner and I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for Pig & Pickle. Driving past it for 5 months built up my expectations to be quite high, but overall, it was just A-OK. I had their truffle fries and bone marrow and it was just fine. The fries were average, definitely better than fast food but not better than any other fancier joint in the area. The bone marrow was saltier than I would have liked. As in, way too salty by like 5-10 dashes of salt.  I think this restaurant definitely has a lot of potential and is a really cool hangout for young people in Scottsdale, but could be better considering its competition in the area."}
{"text":"This may be the coolest late night spot in the entire state of Arizona. The triple threat of being open late, having delicious food/beer and having a live DJ playing that boom bap is a combo I dare you to find elsewhere in this area.  I highly recommend the gin and guice cocktail and the buffalo pork shanks. They have an extensive list of craft beer as well. The service is good and the entire place is clean, well lit and full of quirky pig themed art. The prices are reasonable and the environment is relaxed and unique. Next time I visit the area this place will be the first stop."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent, but food was way overpriced for what you get. I had the shrimp poboy. Not that impressed."}
{"text":"The last three times we came here for lunch this place was closed for no apparent reason. It seems like they are never open. Way too hip to have any kind of consistency in their business hours."}
{"text":"what a huge pile of disappointment this place is. how this restaurant has four stars is a serious mystery to me.   my fiance and i came here for dinner one night when we were both absolutely starving.  we would have thought almost anything was delicious at that point, and we were still totally let down. in order to accommodate our crazy hunger, we ordered a ton of food. we started with the house made charcuterie plate and couldn't find anything on it that we enjoyed.  i love pickled foods, but there was something about the flavor that really turned me off.    next up was the creamy broccoli and brown ale soup.  this tasted like something you'd get at applebees or chili's and looked like it too.  it was so boring and generic-i figured the ale would give it an interesting flavor, but it just tasted like a bland bowl of whatever.   i know we ordered at least three other things, but they were so whatever that i literally can't even remember what they were.  i was also disappointed to later find out they have a tot of the day (loooove tater tots), but our server never mentioned them.   i can't see a reason to return to this restaurants unless it's for a cocktail only and i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came here multiple times mostly because of the convenience of the location. Have to say it's very tasty and definitely made us come back for more. It's been since January but I still remember the delicious charred Brussels sprouts and crispy skin trout!"}
{"text":"P & P is a foodie place. The speciality, as the name suggests, is meat, particularly pork. The pork shoulder tostadas with kimchi are to die for: fluffy, moist, perfectly seasoned. The pulled pork melts in your mouth and kimchi topping is the perfect accompaniment. There are two per serving, and with the side order of Dump Truck Salad--a generous serving of fresh greens with seeds of and vinaigrette dressing, you have a perfect small meal. Amazing deals during 4-6 happy hour and late night menu (10pm-2 am) on both food and drink (tostadas are always on the menu). Other favourites: pork belly tacos, vegetarian burgers, regular burgers (they bake they own buns, and those are brioche buns!!). There is an ample selection of boutique beers and drinks made with freshly squeezed juices and home-made spirits. Definitely order seared carrot cake dessert with chevre whip topping. Worth the trip from anywhere in Phoenix."}
{"text":"P &P's Easter brunch...in a word: Awesome! Fabulous spread with biscuits and gravy, eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, baked items and salmon with capers. My favorite was the goat cheese focaccia. Plus you could order from the menu their signature P&P Benedict, a non meat Benedict, farmers omelet or waffles. And of course their famous $5 mimosas and bloody Mary's along with a fabulous list of craft beers. And...wait for it...the price? Just $25 per person! So the brunch for 2, 2 bloody Mary's and 2 craft beers plus generous tip: only $90!"}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place!  Such great food!  Wait staff is friendly and courteous, and pretty accommodating for those with issues with food allergens.  Recommend the pork belly, Bloody Mary, and just about anything else; I have yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We were staying in Tempe for a couple of weeks before we tried this place, and wish we'd found it sooner. Friendly, dog-loving, patio space and gourmet foods. I had the pot roast Sammie, she had the Cuban. They pickle their own pickles and bake their own breads. They get their fries from a local food truck until their late night menu starts (which Brings duck fat fries in tow). We really hope to make it back one day, but you should definitely try it."}
{"text":"I reserved a table here for my birthday dinner for a party of 10. Table was ready for us right away. My friends brought in a birthday cake for me but we weren't allowed to because if their policy which is fine. They were able to store it for us. I think the manager or owner felt bad so he gave us a bottle of champagne for the table. THAT is great customer service right there. He was so friendly and welcoming! I totally recommend this place!   As for the food, everything we got was delicious! Duck breast, pork shoulder tostadas, steak, pork shank. Everyone loved their food. The carrot cake and Mississippi mudcake was amazing!!!  Thank you for the wonderful dining experience on my birthday!"}
{"text":"Our second time eating here today! Brunch- Zach was awesome, best bloody marys I have had! Comes with a shot of beer. My hubby had the breakfast burrito and I had the bavette and eggs. Incredible! Dinner- u must try a few different home made cocktails, everything is natural and fresh. My favorite was the missionary. We shared the  charcuterie platter- huge, so yummy and the groundd burger we also split. Great hamburger, even the tomatoes were awesome! Great vibe in the bar, music was old school, very chill. We also had the peach cobbler, holy crap. Best dinner ever!!;)"}
{"text":"First time there last night. Had the blt. Amazing. The first bite was a flavor explosion. The vinegar on the fries was a bit much for my pallet. My wife had the hamburger and said it was great but again, the fries didn't work. Service was very good. A lot of menu items I wouldn't go for but what I had was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Went there for Sunday breakfast, and was absolutely blown away!!  EVERYTHING is custom crafted, and made to the highest standards.  Their regular lunch and dinner menus are equally good.  Wherever you are in the valley, this place is worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"took the family out to P&P for New Year's Eve lunch - 8 of us and every one was very happy with their meals - including a vegetarian and two gluten-intolerants. the Veg had the fried brussels sprouts and a beet salad and swooned - also a Maggie margarita that was excellent; Glutens had breakfast (raved about the pork belly & potatoes), and beet salad + order of bacon, and they must lose money on the bacon; easily 7-8 slices of excellent quality pig sides.  Sis had the 'Cuban Pickle Crisis' - a superb Cubano sandwich, and hubby had the P&P club - both raved about the quality and the size of the meals.  Niece had 'Apocalypse Sow', I had a bite and it is excellent.  I had a patty melt, I'm a sucker for home-made rye, and ordered it medium-rare, but got it well done.  It's hard to get a burger properly cooked medium-rare here in the Valley, but I expected better here; the quality of the Naiman Ranch beef was good, but,,,,,,,,,,,, come on guys. PS  - Our server, a grey-haired rail of a happy smiling man, was very good and not intrusive - it was easy to tell when we were all laughing out loud that he should wait a minute to ask how we're doing - we're doing just fine. All-in-all  it was a very good dining experience, and I will go back."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried has been amazing!  They have an awesome menu with lots of interesting, and perfectly crafted meals.  My favorite dish has to be the Brussel Spouts with a fried egg, but usually we just order a bunch of appetizers and build a charcuterie board to share.  Servers are always ready to make recommendations from start to finish including and excellent selection of craft beers and whisky.  If you are in the mood to have some great food and dine in a very casual dining room and patio make plans to try this place."}
{"text":"Lower your expectations, this place is over priced, staffed with untrained and unprofessional employees. A successful business requires good service with a good product and they failed on both. Ordered a sandwich and they \" politely rejected institutions\". Most customers expect some flexibility especially for a $14.00 sandwich. The scary thing that owners, investors and managers should be concerned with is the empty parking lot, with plenty of time for thier employees to catch up on email and text."}
{"text":"This place serves consistently delicious food and has an incredibly friendly staff. Be sure and check out the amazingly dog friendly patio!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large party of 10 with reservations. Everything was set and prepared for our arrival. The place is really open and spacious with the kitchen also being open. Luckily we came around 5:30 and took advantage of the Happy Hour deals. Literally every drink on the happy hour menu was excellent! My favorite was the Pain Killer. They also had killer deals on food on happy hour as well.   We had a large party so I was able to try a bunch of different dishes. The biggest standouts would be the Crispy Duck, Brussels, Steak, and the pickles!! Everything was cooked to perfection and flavor profiles were well balanced. They also can add bacon/pork belly to literally anything. Make sure to ask for pickles regardless of what you order!  Service was solid as well, it was my friend's birthday and our server solo sang him Happy Birthday like a champ."}
{"text":"Fun gastropub- easy to find with ample parking. Service was quick, very attentive to almost too attentive. Menu was pretty awesome with a lot of fun things to try. Everything we ordered was outstanding. Make sure you are sharing the small plates because they are actually pretty hefty portions. Beer selection was decent, nothing out of this world. Some breweries were local and unknown to me. Others were not so special. They do a tasting flight with hefty 6 or 8oz pours in mason jar like glasses. My only qualm was that the interior space is massive and tables are far apart or high up in the air giving an awkward, vulnerable dining experience rather than cozy and intimate."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night and the food was outstanding!  we started with the house made charcuterie, pickles and bread.  YUM!!  The different jams were delicious.  I had the apocalypse sow and could not finish it!!  I wanted to but alas I was done!  They have a good selection of beer and wine to go with your mean.  Our server Steve was great and knew the menu very well!  And for bonus points the place is open late!!!!"}
{"text":"I like to consider this place a little diamond in the ruff. Came to this place cause it was highly recommended to me by a chef friend, (Gloor (-;), and so glad I decided to give it a shot! I've been here a few times now and haven't had one bad thing off the menu. They have these giant tots that are stuff with different things everyday. It's a place you can tell the chef is passionate about his food and it clearly shows through the food. Ingredients are fresh and cooked to perfection. Currently on a mission to try everything on the menu. You will not be disappointed in this place. Great vibe and great music."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks . Love their Sunday brunch and drink specials . The fried Brussel spouts with fried egg is outstanding,  I add pork belly really great flavors ."}
{"text":"Great happy hour selections included were some beer selections and food apps. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Whoa! Gave this place 3 stars last time due to hiccups in service (it was their first week or so in business). But after a visit for dinner today with my family I had to update it to 5 stars. The service was absolutely above and beyond. Our server was quick and helpful. The entire staff was so kind to my baby nephew who had a few crying bouts. The staff came out with a bowl of ice cream to help calm him down and even gave him a piece of bacon on the way out.  And of course, once again the food was incredible. Every single person in our party ordered something unique off the menu and loved it."}
{"text":"Last week I had a group of 10 people from work.  We were all out-of-towners-- And it became my duty to find a place where we could have food and drink.  Thanks to Yelp, I found Pig and Pickle!  At 4:30pm I called for a reservation, and at 6:15pm we showed up and were seated immediately.    The staff was very friendly.  We had a patient waiter, who had a second waiter with him whenever serving us.  They were so good.    We got our drink orders in, and I forgot what everyone got.   They have an extensive drink menu, whether it's cocktails, beer, wine or anything else alcoholic.   I opted for beer, a Saison Dupont farmhouse summer ale.    I had a hard time choosing because their beer menu is so diverse and interesting.    With all the amazing choices, you should NOT order the usual commercial beer, eg Bud, Miller, etc.   I now can't remember all the food, but we ordered a lot.  We started with a few orders of Shisito peppers that were cooked in a soy sauce mix of some sort.  Some of these peppers were hit or miss in spiciness.   I love spicy, but hit a really strong one, and for about 15 minutes my tongue was about to fall off.   We also started with three orders of the kalbi lettuce wraps.   The kalbi was medium rare and cut thick -- Which made it a little chewy.    To round out the appetizers, we also had two orders of the Brussels sprouts.    If you love Brussel sprouts, you must get these!   I was annoyed that I had share with the group!     Everyone ordered all kinds of entrees. As for me, I opted for the steak, medium rare.   I absolutely loved it.  Simple as that.     I'll be returning to Scottsdale in a few weeks, and you can be certain I'll be here again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Not sure why I waited so long to try it, it's amazing. The pork was soft and delicious, as was the house made mustard and bread. Can't wait to go back to try more. Their cocktails were wonderful as well :)"}
{"text":"Eclectic atmosphere, good food, and friendly staff.   I recommend this place if you're tired of the typical restaurant fare. They have an interesting menu that changes often. DJ came and place some pretty cool tunes on Friday night."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. A friend took me here for dinner on a recent Friday night and we just loved everything. We sat near the bar, at a high table and ordered 5 things off the menu, mostly appetizers but one entree (the pot roast). We also had a salmon appetizer, a pickled appetizer plate, a cheese plate, charcuterie, and possibly one other item. I'm not doing them justice by listing them. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented, with interesting accoutrements accompanying them. And the ingredients were fresh--you can tell.  Our waiter was wonderful. After asking about the beer on the menu, I decided to try the \"surprise\" beer of the moment. They open several kegs a day of different, miscellaneous beers, in addition to their impressive microbrew offerings. Turned out it was a beer I'd been wanting to try but there was only a tiny amount left on tap. The waiter gave me the last half-glass on the house, which was really very nice of him.  With a $15 coupon, we couldn't go wrong. Even without a coupon next time, we still won't go wrong. I recommend this to people who want to try interesting meals with more than just the usual fusion, but real imagination."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I had the hanger steak and Tony had the clams. He ate every single one!"}
{"text":"This continues to be one of our favorite restaurants!  Imaginative menu - and a delight for brunch.  What I love is their willingness to create a special experience for you.  We've hosted private parties in their spacious meeting room, and the manager helps us create the best experience ever.  I love a restaurant where you can add a plate of bacon or pork belly to any entrée!!  They have great vegetarian options too, so something for everyone.   Support local - and be prepared for some great options!!!"}
{"text":"I give them credit for trying, but its just too overpriced for what it is.  My tots were cold in the middle, the waitress couldn't give a semi-accurate description of the dish she served me.  Don't try to order water to drink because the the tiny sippy cup they give with ice holds about one sip.    The tostados were good, but the rest of the meal, the no kids menu, we left disappointed.  If they move the restaurant ten blocks north they can get away with charging those prices, but not here."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice so far (I live next door) so this is based just on the two times I've been here. The first time was good, the second time was better. The first time we came we sat outside and we ordered the tostadas to start which I honestly wasn't a big fan of. I think tostadas are my least favorite Mexican dish so maybe that's why but I think that there are better looking apps on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying. We also tried a tot (can't remember what kind it was that night) but that was the bomb and they're only a $1 which is a deal and just a fun thing to try. Then we split the trip tip steak which I didn't like. It was way too salty which is seriously weird coming from me because I LOVE salt. However, the blue cheese fondue that was on it was reallllly good. I personally wouldn't order that steak again. Our waiter recommended we get a slice of key lime pie and claimed it was the best he had ever had (my boyfriend wasn't convinced) so we tried a slice. It seriously was the best we'd ever had. Sooooooo SO good. I would order that again anytime. I also tried the Salty Dog drink (grapefruit juice and vodka and sea salts) and I wasn't impressed. The salt like was too hard to come off of the glass so you didn't really get any of it when you took a sip. The second time we came I got the mussels with chorizo and those were really good and I'd definitely order them again. The service is really good here and the staff is friendly so that's a huge plus. I am looking forward to trying different things on the menu as well as trying the brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is 4 stars for most food items, but dragged down by a miss on the buffalo - blue cheese pork shanks and the completely rare lamb chops that I ordered medium.  Portion was very small also and cocktails are light on the alcohol. Brussels sprouts with farm egg were a solid 4 stars.  Ambience is cool. If I could give this place 3.5 stars, I would. Tip: if you feel like lamb and you're all about the food instead of atmosphere, try the lamb chops Marsala from uncle Sal's Italian restaurant down the street... They are to die for and it's a very big portion. A full rack instead of four bones."}
{"text":"Bit of a hit or miss for me. The service was slow (especially for a Tuesday) but friendly. The pickle plate was interesting and good. I had the Cuban missile crisis sandwich and couldn't eat much of it as it was drowning in mustard. The bread ended up soggy and sitting in a yellow pond. The \"tator tots\" were lovely - they are actually fried mashed potatoes. Interesting concept but not sure I'd ever go back."}
{"text":"Got take out here tonight for my roommate and I. I've eaten here before and everything was alright, not worth the hype or the price, but good enough for me to go again. As a bartender, I don't and have never left a review for any restaurant or bar ever, but this time was worthy of a first. The bartender when I called to place my order was definitely less than friendly to start. He quoted me 15/20 minutes which is the window in which I arrived. I did, surprisingly, get a quick smile upon realizing I was the take out customer. Other than that, he was totally cold, but whatever, I was in and out. I got home and we both realized first that the fries with our meal were mostly hard as a rock as if they had been sitting under the heat lamp for hours. Even if you could chew through a few, they tasted old. My roommate's brie sandwich was delicious. All I ordered was a regular burger which I was charged $12 for instead of $9. I also was charged 50¢ per meal for take out. Really guys? The bun of my burger was as rock hard as the fries and the entire meal was (no exaggeration) a task to eat. Not to mention, it really didn't taste that great. All around, I feel like I was overcharged and wasted my money on inedible food that's sitting in my trash can. I've heard the background of this place and used to respect it, but out of the 10/12 employees working with maybe 3 people at the bar and 5/6 tables, nobody could be attentive enough to put out some decent food or even kind? Pretentious restaurants are popping up everywhere and some people enjoy that, but mostly people just want good food and good service, none of which were apparent today. Bummer too, because I make a point to support local businesses."}
{"text":"Checked out the P&P for restaurant week.  We arrived early and decided to test out the happy hour specials at the bar before having dinner.  There are lots of apps for about $5 to sample during happy hour.  I recommend the beer cheese.  It was really good.  The charcuterie board was pretty good as well though I didn't care for jam.  The HH drink specials were ok with drinks and beer in the $5 range.  Might as well stick with the liquor.    The main event came around and I couldn't do the 3 course restaurant week menu on the account of the appetizers at the bar.  I opted for the Apocalypse sow (pork burger with bacon).  I wasn't in love with it.  I'd recommend going for the regular burger with a big slice of pork belly added on.  It'd be a $1 cheaper and better.  The rest of the party ordered various things, including the restaurant week menu.  The marrow bones looked great, the crispy chicken received good reviews, and the $2.50 cans of Hamm's were certainly enjoyed.  For dessert, the Elvis was probably the one that went over the best.  All in all, the P&P has a great atmopshere, creative food, and good specials.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Pig & Pickle for some time now. Luckily, since my co-workers know I'm a foodie, they gifted me $50 giftcard to try Pig & Pickle. I grabbed my husband and we hustled down for Happy Hour. Happy Hour runs from 4 - 6pm daily and they have plenty of appetizers for $5 and numerous drink choices. Since we wanted to make the most of our experience, we ordered three items off the Happy Hour menu.   First, we ordered pork tacos. I am not going to lie - these were the best thing we ate all night. If we had only ordered the tacos, we would have been in hog heaven - pun intended. The pork was flavorful and spicy with a tender slice of avocado on top. Only two came to an order, but they were perfectly delicious. After trying the other menu items, I wish we had just ordered more of the tacos.  Next, we ordered the pork tostadas. This was pork shoulder with ginger aioli, kimchi, and scallions. The pork, while extremely tender, was flavorless. The kimchi (pickled cabbage) was off putting - after one bite, I picked all the kimchi off. Even my husband, who normally likes kimchi, commented on how off it tasted. Needless to say, we were not impressed.  For our final appetizer, we ordered the chef's choice house made charcuterie. This came with some pickled vegetables, several meats, a spicy mustard, a bacon jam, and two types of bread. Let me just say, the house made bread was fantastic. It was soft and flavorful. My husband enjoyed the bacon jam and I liked the spicy mustard. The pickled vegetables were meh. (There were pickled pearl onions, pickled green beans, and to quote the waitress, \"pickled pickles\".) I don't remember the exact names of the types of meat except there were three of them - one being a pork sausage. Again, we weren't very impressed with the selection.  For dinner, my husband ordered the littleneck clams with chorizo and a side of pork belly. The clams were in a white wine sauce with herbs and tomatoes. I tried a slice of the chorizo and it was tasty, but overall my husband didn't really like the meal. Even the pork belly, which he loves, was just \"okay\".   I ordered the smoked pot roast sandwich. This came with Havarti, caramelized onions, and creamy horseradish on a hoagie roll. I had the option of French fries or a small salad and decided to go with the fries. The fries were both good and bad at the same time. They had a nice flavor to them, but they didn't seem cooked all the way through. You know how you bake a potato and sometimes the inside isn't cooked - it's in that half stage of being slightly tender but chewy? That's how all the fries were. Which is definitely not the norm for fries but it was so odd that I kept eating them, trying to see if it was all of them or just one. (It was all of them.) The sandwich also gave me mixed feelings. The roast itself was tender but flavorless. When combining all the sandwich flavors, it actually tasted good. (The onions really complimented the roast and the horseradish gave everything a spicy kick.) Overall, it was a decent sandwich but nothing to rave about.  In the end, we used our entire giftcard. My husband commented that he was glad we had a giftcard so we could try everything but that he wouldn't go back. I agreed and we probably won't be back. Mainly, the food was just \"okay\" (except  the tacos - if you do go, get the tacos) and the restaurant is about 30 minutes away from us. It's hard to justify driving 30 minutes for \"okay\" food. The service was nice. Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and prompt. She helped us decide on what to order when we had questions and gave us her opinion on dishes.  Overall, the restaurant is a neat idea - everything is house made and fresh but the execution/flavor was just lacking. If we are ever in the neighborhood, we might give it a second chance but who knows when that will be."}
{"text":"Okay so I love this place. I live around the corner so I am there at least once a week and I think they know me by name which is slightly embarrassing.  They have taken a quiet strip mall space and turned it into an amazing gastropub type restaurant. The ingredients are fresh, in season and local, they put tons of thought into the menu, the beer list is extensive and the old fashioneds make me feel like don draper in mad men.  Try \"the nancy\" and the cheese plate is a must. Also attend happy hour here for great deals, I think it's from 4-6."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great drinks and friendly service. We actually came for lunch but the menu was still serving breakfast items. We decided to stay anyway and I'm so glad we did! The mimosa was wonderful, you could tell the orange juice was fresh squeezed. They had items on the menu I had actually never even heard of but after the waiter gave a little bit of an explanation, they were merely just fancy names. I got the biscuits, eggs and pork gravy. It had a really complex name but it was basically just sunny side-up eggs, southern style biscuits in gravy with pork pieces instead of ground sausage. I would definitely recommend, it was great spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"Returned for Sunday brunch with friends a couple weeks ago, and it was every bit as good as our first visit. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, looking for a non-Tex-Mex happy hour, just go here.  Really.  Or if it's late night and you need a nosh (and a drink).  Just go here.  Really.  'Nough said.  What to eat?  Pork belly anything.  You had me at pork belly.  And boy, do they know how to do it here.  But also delightful sashimi apps on occasion. I've had many of their fish specials, and it's always a winner.  Happy hour wines on tap.  Yes, you read that right.  They have solid wine selections to compliment the savories - and you can read about the happy hour (and late-night) savories in the other reviews.    Pig & Pickle has a nice comfy vibe, eclectic clientele (from Scottsdale usuals to hipsters to service industry types).  Comfortable, homey fine dining.  Boy I hate the word \"gastropub.\"  It's really an edgy bistro trying to slum it a bit.  But in a good way.  Comfortable enough to hang but just industrial enough to rotate the 8-tops.    And--get this--I don't like dessert.  BUT:  The carrot cake is just heavenly.  Really.  Just say yes.  I get it every time.  Unless I'm saving room for yet another smoked salmon app or charcouterie plate.  MMMM.  *checks web for flight times to the Valley...."}
{"text":"I've visited three times for brunch so far. If I was to grade my meals on a A-F scale, I would give them \"C\", \"A\", and \"B,\" respectively. So, I think the food is definitely good.   The reason I give this place a 3/5 is from my last experience. Our waitress was very friendly, but the overall service was very sloppy, so much so that I had to write this review.  1) The hostess seemed careless in refilling our waters, nearly knocking our glasses over several times. Though I'm not a prude when it comes to fashion, her gothic, Stevie Nicks look was odd given the décor of the restaurant. It also looked and felt like she had some attitude.  2) I didn't get to start my actual meal until five minutes after it was delivered. The reason was I had to waive down the waitress for basic items associated with a brunch.   -- I had to waive her down for ketchup (I had eggs and potatoes on my plate, and anther person had potatoes.) -- I then had to wave down the waitress for salt (There is neither salt nor pepper on the tables.) -- I needed butter but did not ask for it simply because I was tired of waiving her down. The toast could have REALLY used it; being in the army though, I've had worse.   3) Finally, just plain inattentiveness was an issue. There were long breaks in between her visits. (The place was slowly becoming busy, around 11am). The table ordered a second round of cocktails and they did not arrive. I could have used a coffee refill during the meal but that offered AFTER she delivered our check."}
{"text":"Pig and Pickle is amazing. They have a phenomenal food menu. The food will blow any foodie away. Someone clever; who knows what they are doing must have done the menu. They serve amazing food till 1:00am, what more could you want? The only thing around that rivals Pig and Pickle's food; is they're cocktail and beer menu. Service/staff could not be more helpful and friendly.   I'm"}
{"text":"Sexy.  Everything about this place is just plain sexy.  I had one of the best nights I've ever had in this part of scottsdale. Thank you P&P What a gem..!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the bartenders were very helpful and friendly! However the restaurant server could use more training and or an extra set of hands our table felt very ignored she walked past us a couple times without offering to refill empty drinks and when we asked for condiments she never brought them I had to get them from the bartender myself!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the location might make you think otherwise due to the fact it's in a strip mall next to an E-cig joint and a MMA sparring gym. But forget that noise, because once you are inside you forget where you are.   First and foremost- beverages as in cock motherfucking tails are top notch. Every drink they mix is done to perfection, I hate these other god damn restaurants where everything is too sweet or they put 18 different mixers in each drink. I want to taste my booze and Pig serves it up just right.  They use high quality alcohol paired with outstanding bitters and tinctures. They even have a few cocktails they age themselves.  Not only are the drinks awesome but beer and liquor selection is killer.   On to the food, obviously this place serves some bomb ass meats from pork belly to foie gras smear to carnitas tostadas. I have ordered several items and have never been let down unlike my sex partners. The Elvis dessert is downright tasty.   Lastly, the service is always exceptional, granted I only sit at the bar or do take out but they are always friendly and go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience.   I love this place and it is head and shoulders above a lot of the old town Scottsdale hyped up bullshit restaurants."}
{"text":"Went here lately night with family and friends after a spring training game. We were seated outside and it was a perfect night. Most of us ordered the Apocalypse Sow, I had the lettuce wraps, one grandson had burger and fries other grandson had something called madam something. Portions were huge!!!!  Everyone got quiet and you could tell we all enjoyed the food. Water, tea and beer was flowing and the service was really good. Very nice experience. Thanks Check Please, AZ for the review. We had a great time."}
{"text":"First of all anyone that rates this place under 5 stars needs to have their brain checked. The quality of the ingredients show how much the owners care! I had the hanger steak with chimichurri sauce cooked perfectly and my husband had the duck with spinach and rice (nothing but mmm noises the whole time, that's how good it was!) One of the owners checked in on us and actually made a drink, where do you ever see that?!?!? Ugh nowhere! Really glad I came across this place!"}
{"text":"The last experience I had a pig and pickle was awful. We had been once before and it had been alright food but I wanted to give it another try since we live in the neighborhood and I had heard great reviews. We went for the late night service and called before I went to make sure they were still serving the waitress was hesitant to say yes even though there was over an hour of service left. I have worked in the food industry and if you're open your open you can't complain about your hours. When we got there the same lady helped us with our food. We ordered a couple drinks and asked what she recommended for food. She recommended the pork tostadas THEY WERE TERRIBLE. When she brought over the food it smelled rancid.... like she was serving us rotten meat. I ate one bite and couldn't take another. She never came back to our table to ask how her food was so I'm almost positive she did it on purpose because we didn't eat a single bite of it. I am not usually quick to judge but the behavior was unacceptable. We could never get her attention so we paid in cash and left. Terrible experience. We will never be back. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Awesome restaurant with delicious food, good drinks, and friendly service. Cocktails are good, and they have live music on fridays. Really fun, casual vibe."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the  shrimp and grits! So yummy . The sauce was spicy and had a New Orleans flare to it. Hats off to the chief for that dish! The post roast Sammie was decent, their attempt at a brisket sandwich. The tater tots were really like hush puppies and you only got two, disappointing. The lettuce wraps were good and different with the kimchi. Overall, good experience. Service was pleasant and our server had some good recommendations. I would go back for the shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"A bit late on the review (maybe I'm just getting over my shock and awe of the delicious food I didn't know about!) but my family and I had a wonderful evening here a couple weeks ago. We ordered the Ratatouille with pulled pork, Nancy sandwich, and shrimp and grits. Super good food and I love how you can see the kitchen cooking all of the food! However the desserts were the main star for us - blackberry vinegar pie and a glazed carrot cake did us in. We still can't stop talking about them (go out for dinner someone else, get dessert, \"but what about that vinegar pie and carrot cake\"...happens every time) :) Christina was a great server. Thank you P&P! Definitely want to come back here for late night!"}
{"text":"We had an overall good experience I guess I just had high expectations going in The drinks and appetizers were amazing We got the charcuterie board But my entree the pork burger fell flat after that I think the patty could have used more seasoning"}
{"text":"Pig and Pickle never ceases to amaze me. The food is amazing and the specialty cocktails are amazingly concocted. Bottled beer selection is stellar and they have a few draft beer options  Staff is always friendly and you receive a warm welcome every time you walk through the front door. Food menu changes on a regular basis as the chefs like to keep the diners on their toes by providing new and exciting dining experiences.   I'd strongly suggest the bone marrow and once you've finished the marrow wash it down with the bone marrow bourbon shot (just as Scotty the bartender!)."}
{"text":"Good place to come with friends for food and drinks. They have a large selection of craft beers and their bovine inspired cuisine is very tasty."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than Pig & Pickle...outstanding food , great service and good value without being pretentious. Pork belly tostadas...awesomeness! Smoked salmon stacked high in a latke...delicious! Gruyere with local honey, bee pollen and apricot jam was delightful. The wife loved the tostadas the she ordered them for her entree. The Apocalypse Sow was the best burger I have ever had...the ground pork, bacon and cheese was heavenly. Cod fish and tatters were very good. The s'mores dessert was worthy enough to go just for the desert.  The hostess, the manager (Chris) and our server  (Justin)  provided outstanding service . They know how to make you feel welcomed and make it easy to want to come back again and again. I recommends everyone to go here!"}
{"text":"Edible, but not impressed. I was excited about it because of the reviews and was not satisfied. I may have just purchased the incorrect entree (salad) which was bland with not much flavor at all. Feel free to give it a try, but be sure to order something other than a salad."}
{"text":"Here's the deal with this place. I think your either going to really like it or really hate it. My wife and I are one of the people that really enjoy this place. I'm not a big fan of the pickled stuff but their food is amazing! They serve bone marrow. I know it sounds gross but I would recommend it. It's served with bread and it's like a butter topping for the bread. Their carrot cake is the best cake I think I've ever had!! I also really enjoy their brunch menu. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I read good reviews, but when I went for lunch I was surprised by how small the menu is. I expected traditional barbecue, but it really isn't. I ended up ordering a salad and cheese soup. Everything was fine, but in a town like Scottsdale with so many choices, I won't rush to come back."}
{"text":"Only a restaurant for those who like different types of foods.  Attentive service, but the food took a long time to arrive to our party of eight.  Look at the online menu before venturing out."}
{"text":"I was told that the chef at the Pig & Pickle used to be the chef at the Atlas Bistro, so I had very high hopes for Pig & Pickle. I went with my family & for the five of us, we shared three apps and five entrees. The tostada & the buffalo shanks were both pretty good, but the charcuterie plate was forgettable. Of the five entrees ordered, nothing rocked my boat all that much, nothing wrong, but nothing right.   On the up side, the service was excellent. The waiter was really nice & didn't seem to be bothered by my family's tendency to be a little boisterous.   One thing that did annoy me... I was the designated driver, so I ordered a diet cola with dinner. Out came a diet cola in a cute bottle. It was good but not no refills good for a three dollar soda.   I probably won't be back, not because it was bad, but I know where to get better."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is not a good place come if you;re on a diet.  so far we tried,...  Bone Marrow, pork shoulder tostada, rib eye steak----which was amazeballs--- stuffed tater tots, duck, and fried fish.  I think I loved alll of these with the exception of the fried fish. It was crispy crunchy but there's so many better yummy things on the menu.  the vibe is casual and service has always been great. the patio is petfriendly so you can bring your beloved furbaby here if you'd like!"}
{"text":"Food was really good.  We got good service.  The pickled things platter was really tasty and included pickled grapes, cactus, okra, bread & butter pickles and a garlic pickle!"}
{"text":"We were searching for a less pretentious atmosphere after calling around Scottsdale for reservations. I saw a write up in Valley Guide in our room and read reviews on Yelp. Well, we scored!  I should mention that we are traveling with our 5 year old with a nut allergy. The staff was incredible and accommodating and so knowledgeable about the menu. We arrived for the end of happy hour and ordered the tostadas with pork and kimchi and the dump truck salad. Both excellent. The salad was very seasonal with cauliflower, radish and cucumber, my 5 year old loved each bite. My son's burger was hand made with homemade bread.  After our apps we had the mussels with chorizo and homemade bread. When I asked the waitress if it was good she begged us to order it. It did not disappoint. We also had the pickles on the side which was not just house made pickles but a pickled egg, beans, okra, mushrooms, beets and even grapes, all distinctly different from each other. My only complaint was that there was a lot of fennel in each dish we had, so by the end of the meal we had a bit of fennel fatigue.  Would make a big effort to come back here again when in town. The staff was so attentive and knew so much about the drinks and dishes. We didn't drink this evening but the specialty drinks were as well thought out as the dishes. It was a pleasure just reading the menus."}
{"text":"Had a work Happy Hour here. The food was awesome and they have a huge drink menu. Jake was our waiter and he was amazing.   We had almost every appetizer on the happy hour menu ordered to the table and everything was eaten so fast we had to order more."}
{"text":"Just relocated to the area and needed to grab a bite after a long day of moving boxes and furniture.  P&P is my neighbor so I went in for convenience but will be returning as a local.  The food was great and so were the beers.  Great knowledgeable staff and our dog even received a little treat as well.  Love that the tot recipe is ever changing!"}
{"text":"12/13/12  Nice space!  Let me rephrase that-- very cool-looking bar counter, but the rest of the room was too open, with low four-tops in the middle of the main room and high two- to four-tops next to bare walls and near the bar area.  It felt a little disconcerting...  Upon entering the restaurant, I immediately gravitated to the bar counter, where the choicest seats seemed to be.  The bartender there was friendly and eager to tell me all about the beers offered here.  After being able to sample one of the beers (sorry, none of the ones listed online sounded familiar), I decided to go with a glass of Malm Sonoma pinot noir ($10).  A pet peeve of mine is having to drink wine from a beer glass- not cool, but I got over it.  I started off with the Braised Pork Belly, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=IxQZJrjKInhC-mVb9TCd1g#IxQZJrjKInhC-mVb9TCd1g which came charred (grr!) and sitting on top of a delightful silky bed of (not cloyingly) sweet yam puree, and garnished with Brussels sprouts slaw and maple syrup.  I expected the pork belly to have a little more crunch after seeing all that char, but it was almost too tender.  It tasted quite lovely, but I preferred the pork belly that Roka Akor used to serve (I hear it's not on the menu, anymore?).  I really enjoyed the yam puree's contribution to the dish-- it was almost jammy.  Still, at $10, I'm going to skip it next time (and resolve to look for it on my next trip to Roka Akor!).  For my main, I had the Braised Duck Leg, $13, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=aUDb-8nR1pDZroVx1gHiHQ#aUDb-8nR1pDZroVx1gHiHQ which was a work of art!  Gorgeous colors and a MYRIAD of textures and flavors, it is definitely a dish I would order again and again!  The duck was crispy and very delicious- one of the best pieces of duck I've ever had the pleasure of tasting!  I especially enjoyed the crispy mung bean cake upon which the leg was placed on.  (Being Asian, I am familiar with mung beans- red, yellow, and green, to name a few, so to see this ingredient used in a novel way in American cuisine was exciting!)  I so loved the big bursts of ginger flavor in the cake-- I wish to see this item on more menus- at least as a substitute for crispy polenta, or risotto.  The sweet soy had almost a balsamic twist to it.  I whole-heartedly recommend this dish!  To finish, I ordered the Apple Turnover, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=4bSitqEOaCaP4SvbuyJb6A#4bSitqEOaCaP4SvbuyJb6A with vanilla-bean ice cream, $6- a special of that day, which required I wait an extra twenty minutes to bake-- I do not mind waiting for freshly-baked pastries!  This delightfully-flaky turnover arrived atop a rivulet of beautiful caramel sauce, piping-hot tender spiced apple slices inside, a dollop of creme fraiche, and apple matchsticks on top.  All of this was garnished with toasted pine nuts... Exquisite, and yes, I ate it all!    Since I arrived during happy hour, I was able to get a $1 off each item.  I found the tab a bit pricey ($46, including an $8 tip), but I did have wonderful leftovers for lunch at work the next day-- everyone kept eyeing what I was eating and asked where I found it on the buffet spread!  As if!  :)  I'll absolutely be back! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=AFu1PBeqCLa2A1NVFXRwbA#AFu1PBeqCLa2A1NVFXRwbA"}
{"text":"A fairly eclectic menu featuring items such as pork liver, braised pork shank, and pork belly, Pig and Pickle is a porcine charm.  If you like whiskey, Pig features a selection of over fifty (rough guess) types of spirits including unique ryes that'll produce a Manhattan cocktail reminiscent of a Wall Street watering hole.   The patio is noisy due to its open access to Thomas Road. On this night, everyone seated on the patio nearly jumped out of their chairs at the sound of skidding tires thinking an accident was in progress.  Shortly after, a loud boom from across the street, likely a car backfire, but nerve shattering nonetheless. Throughout dinner, the evening was littered with annoying roadway distractions, not fun.  My advice? Don't opt for the patio no matter how loud the climate inside.   Service was stellar, with the waiter offering helpful tips, advice on how things are prepared and how many servings to expect from various appys. Prompt, courteous, and seemingly well trained.   I had a pork shank accompanied by yams. The yams were a bit spicy but not too, just enough to add a spectacular flavor and wake up your taste buds. Unexpected and flavorful surprise for the non-yam enthusiast.   Pig and Pickle has done a good job with everything we experienced save for some type of barrier between the patio and the roadway to help with noise abatement."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time after hearing good things, finally got the chance and was very pleased.  The best part of our experience was that they were open late, not a lot of good food joints open late in the South West!    I ordered the shrimp and grits but the grits came out cold, they made me a new one and threw in a free dessert.  The ground pork burger (can't remember the name of it) was outstanding, everything about it was super yum!  Definitely will return :)"}
{"text":"We came around lunch time on a Sunday so they had the brunch menu up for grabs. We started with a basic beer and glass of wine, but ended with a yummy cocktail and one of the better bloody mary's I've had. This place is just fun to sit and drink at -cute bar, fun vibe, great bartender. We should have gotten the tots - they change daily based on their menu apparently and the guy next to us got them and we were very jealous. I ended up getting the biscuits and gravy with pulled pork added and fiance had the eggs benny. Both were good, but I think I would prefer their dinner menu more than their brunch. My biscuits or gravy had that refrigerator taste but the pulled pork was good. Fiance said he would have preferred pork belly to the pulled pork on his benny. Needless to say, I am giving this place 5 stars because I have heard such great things and we had such a good time. I'm thinking the flavors were just a mistake that day and you can't base judgement off of your one time, especially when friends go all the time and have a great experience."}
{"text":"The food I had was delicious!    The bar is very small and really crowded (other patrons leaning over your food to try and order a drink).  No more than 3 stars though.  When I first realized the hours of operation, I thought it was a joke.  This place doesn't open until 4pm everyday?!?  For a wannabe gastropub?!?  In Old Town?!?    Hello???  Old Town is a day drinking society!  No one here waits until 4pm for a cocktail.  How can Old Town patrons come drink if you're not even open???    Also, not enough TVs."}
{"text":"Host staff wasn't so great but Christina who showed up mid conversation told us to get a table to get water while we waited for our to go food. We ended up eating our soup in the restaurant mom and I shared the bacon, Wisconsin cheddar, broccoli soup. It was absolutely amazing. I'd advise on sharing it because it was very rich. Christina told us to get the carrot cake but we were so full we got it to go. I'm normally a chocolate person but our server said she is too but loves the carrot cake! It was freaking delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The cocktails and poutine brought us back two nights in a row. The sandwiches are on fresh made bread that put the whole thing over the top. Great food and drinks at an affordable price."}
{"text":"This is my second review, based on me having been there three times since my first 5 star review. The second time it was still pretty good, though the menu was missing some good items. The third time was with a larger group of 7. Food was ok generally, but my duck with huitlacoche was just mushrooms being passed off as huitlacoche. Service was decent. Last time will be last time. Made a reservation for a specific table. When we got there the table wasn't ready. No problem, but it irked me when the hostess pointed at the couple still in the table we had reserved and sighed. It was like she was passing the buck even though it wasn't necessary. We wait about 15 minutes and then the hostess gets us and proceeds to take us to a different table. I look over at the one I had reserved. It was empty and just needed to be cleaned off. I told her that that was the table we had been waiting for. She let us move, saying that she just wanted to get us seated. I can't imagine why she thought it would've been a problem to make us wait a couple more minutes to clean off the table we wanted. Then as she cleaned it she once again passed the unnecessary buck by blaming our delay on the person who took the reservation. It was weird. Ok. We're seated. We wait 10 min for water. Finally the waiter comes. By then we know the drinks and appetizers we want. We have to almost force the waiter to take them. He obviously wanted to only take the drink order. We wait a half hour before the drinks and appetizers arrive. No waiter visits during that time, and different people bring them. However, the waiter is continually visiting the tables of young women behind us and in front as well as doting on a larger group. He's busy but I can't figure out why we're ignored. By the time we're done, still no waiter. I had tried to convince my wife and brother to leave before the appetizers arrived. They weren't having it. After another 20 minutes after the appetizers were done, they just want to leave. Finally, almost an hour after we sat down, we get the second waiter visit. He just kinda irritatingly asks if we know what we want. No specials. No bread. Etc., even though he asked all the other tables he was doting on. I said, \"just the check.\" He got annoyed we weren't ordering. Brought the check. Left no tip. Adios forever. We went to the Citizens Public House instead, which has much better food for the same price."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for a small lunch. We were very surprised with how good the menu sounded. We hoped the food would be as good as what our minds were now envisioning..      We ended up very happy that it was.      I had the Biscuits and Gravy for Sunday brunch and my friend had the Chorizo Scramble type of dish.       Mine was wonderful, though they should cut the biscuits in half so it makes four then add gravy. It would be more enjoyable. Adding a couple of tomato slices would be good too.      My friend and I were apprehensive about his Chorizo dish. They make their own and when most places do, it isn't that good. This place is totally the opposite. The Chorizo was fresh, spicy hot and full of flavor. It was FANTASTIC. They should turn it into a dip and serve it as a app later in the day.      Simple put, this place rocks the Pig!      If you order a side of bacon, you get a big plate full. Not 2 pieces. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food amazing. We had the pork shoulder tostadas, bone marrow, and duck entree. Waitress was very knowledgable of food and had great recommendations. I would certainly return."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars had the burger and really did enjoy it.  Happy hour is a great deal  on food but drinks are still pretty expensive."}
{"text":"I've lived down the road from The Pig and Pickle for the past year now and was just recently able to stop in for a late dinner. I ordered the mussels with the chorizo and was very pleasantly surprised. The entire time I was eating I couldn't get over how good they were.  Two of my friends ordered the steak and one friend ordered the trout. We were all talking about how good our meals were the entire time. Not one of us had a complaint.  I can't believe it took me a year to stop in here!! I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"An Arcadia restaurant feel in South Scottsdale. Finally! Happy hour is only $1 off f&b which isn't all that great but we still enjoyed. The cocktails were good and food was also reasonably priced and tasty. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  Been here twice and everything we had was delicious.  Portions are on the larger size.  Prices are reasonable.  Food is fresh and always well prepared.  The bread board is a NOT MISS.  I'm also a big fan of the smoked salmon app on the oversized tater tot.  Their tater of the day is fun, cheap, and worth a try.  When we ordered a side of bacon, they literally brought out a PLATE full of it.  For $3.  SCORE!!  Now taking reservations for parties of 5 or more!"}
{"text":"I really dont like pork. I never cook it, I never order it, but I ate it and recommend it from here because it's that good. I ordered take out, and while I was waiting for them to bring out my food, I hung out by the bar. It has a cute, gastropub feel. I ordered the pork belly appetizer with hummus which made me melt. SO GOOD. The pork shoulder tostadas was good, but I still don't understand why Americans think sour-pickled cabbage is kimchi. Anyway, I definitely want to try other items on their menu... I will be back!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last night. I got their pork burger with side of duck fries.   The food was ok. The bacon on top of the burger was a little plasticky and hard to chew. I really liked the fries, although it was plain and not salted ...  The server came across a bit rude. My biggest disappointment was with their kitchen setup. The food comes out at random times. I got my fries 10 minutes after my burger and everyone's food came out randomly every 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Love the creativity of the menu items here, and when the dishes come out they didn't disappoint. Seems like a lot of AZ restaurants try and put fancy things on their menu but taste doesn't seem to deliver. But Pig & Pickle has it down! Sooooo goooood.   Minus a star because even though the drink menu looked exceptional, all three drinks we ordered were a bit too overpowering and sweet for our tastes...they need to be a bit more balanced. But hey, there's a great selection of beer to choose from, so you can still get your drink on."}
{"text":"Proud to say we had our first beer here. We had the banana bread ale and a chocolate milk stout and were completely satisfied. Pork belly is a requirement to try before you leave!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for dinner and was REALLY impressed.  For a bar the staff is friendly & knowledgeable.  The food is much more gourmet than I'd expected, but isn't pretentious.  Great mix of flavors and concepts.  Had the pork shoulder tostadas, the smoked salmon on scallion tot, along with a great vanilla porter from Tucson brewery (recommended by the bartender when I asked what he had that was local brewed.)  Would go back often if I lived in Phoenix.  For the money, I don't think you can find BETTER quality, and the quantity wasn't skimpy either."}
{"text":"What a culinary adventure this was! Before dragging myself out, i managed to try the pork shoulder tostadas, the tots, and the bone morrow among other things. Although all great, the tostadas is an absolute revelation. Bursting in flavor, it was alone worth the trip."}
{"text":"Awesome experience - great atmosphere, the food was awesome (make sure you try the Tots, they are UNBELIEVABLE) and craft beers on tap...what more could you ask for? We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I went by yesterday 3/16/16 because I heard everyone raved about the place, from San Francisco. Came here for dinner and was highly disappointed. Along with a few other friends the restaurant was closed due to a gas leak.  well I'm glad they are fixing the problem and bummed I wasn't able to try it."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! Came Here after he Super Bowl events becUse we were finally Im Scottsdale and only pig and pickle on the mind. Yum I had the veggie sandwhich add pork belly. Nice all bit home and had the Creative salad on the side"}
{"text":"Had family passing through Phoenix so we had four generations together for dinner. The Pig and Pickle turned out to be perfect! Great service, and an ecclectic selection of locally sourced ingredients all turned into gastronomic delights.  Bring your appetite or be prepared to take home leftovers.   Definitely a place we will be returning to!"}
{"text":"Great service, tasty food, and an excellent Gin selection.  One of the best G&Ts I've had to date."}
{"text":"There are so many places with great food in Scottsdale but few with the service that you get here.  Everyone treats you like a VIP"}
{"text":"Went expecting very good things based on great reviews in the local papers and Yelp. Unfortunately didn't quite live up to expectations. Restaurant itself is nicely appointed and has a good feel. Service was friendly and attentive. Food wasn't quite what I was hoping for though. We had the bone marrow and pork shoulder tostadas to start. Bone marrow was nice - enjoyed the onion jam and pickled onions it came with - nice compliments. The tostadas didn't work for us though - the ginger aioli lacked much ginger and there was just way too much of it. The duck leg was excellent itself, but the bean cake it came with didn't do much for me, and the bean sprouts and cabbage slivers on top didn't do much for the plating or the dish over. The pot-roast sammie was good, but the fries were barely warm and no longer crispy - which was a bummer.  I'd probably give this another shot as I liked the concept, but probably not in a big hurry to go back. Pricing generally good, though if they shave a dollar or two off the apps that would help."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time. The tostadas were outstanding my daughters veggie burger was excellent too!! ..... and you can add bacon for free. The service was excellent we sat at the bar and spoke with one of the owners Clayton. Definitely will go back here."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new so my husband and I stopped in for a late lunch. We shared the Cuban with home made tots and a bowl of their broccoli cheese soup. Everything was delicious. Side note, tots consist of two golf ball sized tots and are worth the extra \"buck fiddy\"."}
{"text":"The food is really good with interesting combinations most of the time but pretty overpriced. I don't go here often but every time I have been in, the menu has changed which is both good and bad. Good that they keep things new, bad if you were hoping to pick up your favorite dish it might not be there."}
{"text":"The owners are great and really know what they're doing. The food here is to die for!! And they have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians which is great. The chef really knows how to make the flavor in all of their dishes just phenomenal. The service is always excellent, especially from Jordan. My good friend also works here, and it's so clear that owners treat their employees with respect. That's so important! What a great all around place."}
{"text":"Brunch and drinks are outstanding, gave only 3 stars for the following  reasons.  Sat at the bar, two bartenders    Not attentive, had to order drinks a few times before  they would awkknowledge and actually make the drinks. Had to wait over 5 minutes just for salt and pepper They got too busy hanging with regulars."}
{"text":"Out of all the place I have done in Scottsdale. This place by far have the most amazing foods, hospitality service ever. Is not from our waiter. Is from the chef himself. He is so on point pushing everything to come out on time. And so accommodating toward our group. Our waiter is not too friendly, he does not have a smile on his face the whole time he serving us. Our wine, cocktail, and beer pairing blend in so well with all our dish. We really have to thank you the chef himself.. For such an Amazing experience"}
{"text":"Straight up, we did not eat a meal here, we ate dessert only and had drinks.    Being only a stone throw from my sister's house and open until late, it was a perfect spot when we decided to do a late dessert before I left early the next morning back home.  At 10:30 pm, the run a \"late night menu\" which had limited yet with variety selection of entrees and desserts.  It also had some recommended drinks.   Being a non-drinker, I have to go by the drinkers' opinions which were that the drinks were good. Upon investigation of the drink menu, an obscure ingredient made these two Hawaii girls go, hmmm. Li hing mui. Upon further investigation we found out that the bartender was originally from Hawaii.  Cool point.   Dessert... ah, even on this late menu, was unique and interesting.  At this late hour, one would be forgiving if a place just offered a slice of pie with ice cream on the side. Not here.  The were individually prepared and it took time to get it.    I'll say this much, when an employee/our server knows all the owners and their history, points them all out at 10:30 on a weeknight, and gushes about their hard work, ability to collaborate and be original; you as business owners, are doing something right.     Overall it seems that this place is ambitious and willing to take the risk, exert the extra energy and push the bill to get people to see that they are not a joke when it comes to creating an original experience.  I can safely say this, on this Tuesday night, by the time we left at about midnight, the place was even more crowded then when we came.    I am definitely coming back again to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding food and service. amazing entrée and the same with the appetizers tremendous selection wine list is good drinks fantastic beer selections, wonderful ready to go back"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour food & beer prices.  Had the Dump Truck Salad, and it was bursting with tons of veggies and probably came in at over a pound.  For $5 it's literally a steal.  The charcuterie plate on HH is also $5 and also amazing.  Great house-made mustard, meats, pickles, etc.  Very unique and tasty.  Wish they had some non-alcoholic beer or cocktail options."}
{"text":"This was a very fun and interesting place. We went for lunch I believe during the week so it really quiet. We shared the tostada appetizer and then shared the apocalypse sow pork burger. Both were very tasty! Service was really great too, they were attentive and friendly. The only thing I would say is the prices seemed a bit high for the portion size they gave you. Other than that our experience was great and we'd go back to try some more options."}
{"text":"It was restaurant week so we got booted to the outside at 5pm, which I think my cousin got bit by a scorpion something, which I'm so glad my baby didn't. Her skin puffed up. It was really bad..  To the food...(happy hour by the way too) The food is that asian/mexican fusion with tacos, etc that just didn't impress me because it's become the norm. My stomach starting hurting afterwards and I had to drink a lot of water. Overall, I just wasn't wowed and my cousin landed in the urgent care = deal breaker"}
{"text":"We had a great experience for dinner last night. Arrived around 6:00 pm, needed a table for 6. The host was so welcoming, he set the tone for a fabulous time. We had two different servers, both had great personalities which made the meal so much fun. We ordered the BLT's made with pork belly, fabulous! A hamburger was also ordered and pronounced delicious as well as a Cuban pickle crisis sandwich which was also a hit. The beer and wine were reasonably priced as well. A great evening and we will definitely be back!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Mixed...have been several times...seems to have gone downhill a bit.  The bacon, however, is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times, and each time I've been impressed with our food. The staff is extremely friendly, and our server always recommends interesting craft cocktails for us to try.   The shrimp and grits are flavorful with creamy grits and a wonderful cured chorizo addition. The \"apocalypse sow\" pork burger was flavorful and juicy but extremely rich. We recommend sharing it with someone. My husband's favorite is the crispy skin trout, which comes with an incredible brown butter sauce and roast fingerling potatoes. The mussels were flavorful with a wonderfully spicy broth. You definitely need the grilled bread to stop up the sauce.   As for the appetizers... I can't say it enough... Pork shoulder tostadas. They're fantastic. We had the Mac n cheese as an appetizer also, and that was even better than we had anticipated."}
{"text":"Pig and pickle... This place came highly recommended by friends so we decided to give it a try.   Service was ok. The waiter forgot to bring our side of shredded pork despite three reminders. Oh well...not the biggest issue. Drinks were ok. The \"special\" hoop-Dee drink at $13 didn't live up to the hype.   We got the pork tostadas with kimchi for appetizers which we really enjoyed. Only disappointment was the kimchi was not spicy. It was either white kimchi or they washed the kimchi of its red pepper. However, we were delighted with the amount of juicy succulent shredded pork on top of the tostadas. I probably could've eaten two servings of these for dinner.  My husband got the Apocalypse Sow burger. True to its name, it's a heart attack/cholesterol buster neatly packaged between two pieces of bread. But it was delicious. Who can say no to various pieces of pork piled on top of each other?  I had the burger with dump truck salad side. The burger was ok. Nothing fabulous. The dump truck salad was nothing phenomenal either. It was an interesting mixture of veggies to include chopped cauliflower. But in my honest opinion, the salad dressing lacked any flavor whatsoever. I was a bit underwhelmed.  But let's get to the pickle spear that comes with your burger. I was very disappointed for an establishment that has \"pickle\" in its name to put a pickle so sour and tart it makes your eyes water on its plates. It wasn't only me that has such a reaction to my bite into the pickle. The whole table of 6 agreed. So I can honestly vouch it wasn't just me... :(   sorry pig & pickle you under delivered on the pickle..."}
{"text":"Yep - first stop - late night - right after landing and picking up the rental car.  One of the few options for late night (that I found when doing my pre-trip research).    They even have a Late Night Menu.  What did we have?    The pickle platter (\"Some Pickled Things\") is a must - many unusual (rarely pickled) items - red grapes anyone?! Delicious!   Also tried the \"Apocalypse Sow\" burger - ground pork burger, bacon, aged cheddar & grilled onions - absolutely great!  Final item we tried was the \"Tot of the Day\" - good - but not up to the standard set by the other two items listed above.  Oh and did I mention the extensive beer menu?  I honestly don't remember what we had, but that's the point - take the guidance offered by the bartender.  You like it hoppy? fruity? heavy/light? - answer honestly - and then drink whatever is put in front of you - you'll be glad you did!  Run, don't walk to the Pig & Pickle!"}
{"text":"Plain jane atmosphere, eggs Benedict on corn pancake was kinda bad, pork belly and eggs was very tasty. Morning missle drink was like fermented OJ that you found in your cooler from last summers camping trip. Wait staff was awesome. I will go back again just for some more pork belly whatever."}
{"text":"Crazy good!  We started with the pork belly and watermelon gazpacho. Both great! The heirloom tomatoes in both dishes cant be beat. So fresh and full of flavor.   For dinner I had the duck leg with an added sunny side up duck egg on top. I can't tell you how awesome it was. They had a torchon de fois gras on the side... Omg. So creamy and dense.   My husband had the grilled ribeye, med rare. Veryyyy good! Cooked perfectly and the scalloped potatoes with leeks was delicious.   Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place. Every time I go I always have a great meal. My favorites are the carnita tostadas with kimchi and of course the house pickle because of the pickled grapes. I will definitely keep returning"}
{"text":"My absolute fav in Scottsdale. The food is locally sourced. The menu is progressive. The chef is grounded. So are the bar staff. All my needs are met and its been going on for some time now. Yes. Its true love."}
{"text":"This is my first \"updated\" review. I hate to say it, but P&P has been on a steady decline and my previous 5 stars must be amended. Sadly this decline has gimped both the service and the food. It started when I was with my best friend and we received, how should I put it... adversarial service from our waiter. I mispronounced the beer company \"deschuttes\"  and was callously mocked. Things went downhill from there. The level of arrogance and disrespect we received from him was way out of line but the food was spot on. Based on the waiter I put P&P on probation for a while.  I returned for some takeout and placed my order at the bar. I recognized one of tha managers and explained to him that my absence was caused by that atrocious waiter. The manager was happy to inform me that he was fired and that he had a bad feeling about hiring him. This time the takeout fell way flat. The pork tostada, which is one of their strongest apps was about 20% pork fat. It was nearly inedible and I had to pick out the pieces before digging in. The flavors were there, but this was a pretty obvious execution error.  The last straw was when I bought my parents in for dinner. Service was aloof, I had to get up and fill my own water due to an absence of attention. The Korean Beef lettuce wraps suffered a myriad of issues. Primairly the steak was served at room temp, combined with being undercooked and disgustingly fatty, this was a complete flop and a textural nightmare. The waiter spotted me filling my parents water glasses themselves and apologized for his lack of attention. I took the opportunity to call him out for poor ap, and he took it off my bill. After the water incident he paid us more attention and P&P crushed the main courses.  I wonder if P&P has had major staff shakeups, because my first handful of visits were flawless (see my original review). The talent in the kitchen and wait staff has had such a blatant fall from grace I can't see myself returining. Ever. A creative concept and menu brought down by poor service and execution. I'm sad but I'm sure I will find a new gastropub."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here tonight, expecting something...more.  I had the trout, and he ordered the steak.  They both were good but just not as good as we had expected it to be.  Or maybe we've just had better.  My biggest complaint about both dishes is that it was surprisingly very lemon-y.  At first, I thought that since I had ordered fish, it must have been topped off with lemon juice because even my mashed potatoes tasted sour.  But my husband's entree was lemon-y too.  It was very bizarre.  Anyway, if we are going to pay around $20/person for fish and steak, I think we'll go somewhere else that uses less lemons in their dishes."}
{"text":"The cocktails and the menu are unique and diverse. If you like homemade simple syrup and infused syrups made here as well as aged whiskey in flavored barrels this is the bar menu for you. The beer menu does not disappoint as for the food brunch is amazing and so is happy hour. The dinner menu changes often and is very gastronomic delights and this is a foodies heaven. If you are in Scottsdale, give pig and pickle a try it will not disappoint"}
{"text":"Never in my 55 years have I been the recipient of such wonderful service. My 90 year old parents, my 5, 20-some year old children, and my 2 year old grandson had an amazing time at Pig and Pickle tonight. Food was great and service every bit as fabulous. The entire staff went beyond the call of duty to keep our lil 2 year old, who awakened mid meal, happy with toys, ice cream, lollipops, bacon slices, etc.  The friendliest restaurant ever and the duck was DIVINE!! We will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"One of my rare perfect scores. This place has great food that is made and produced locally. Awesome service everyone is super friendly and accommodating.   Drinks also on point. I had the Cilantragon Margarita. Tequila, tarragon simple, cilantro, lime, sriracha, fresh sour, burlesque bitters #margarita  Fresh baked bread with their own crafted apricot jam, smoked butter and cherry bacon jam is a must try.   Pork belly with sphinx ranch date glaze, farro, pea tendrils, pickled pearls and bourbon maple pecan brittle. Yumm!  Excellent overall."}
{"text":"Looking forward to trying something a bit different on a Friday night in Scottsdale, so we settled on Pig & Pickle. Let me start by first saying the staff was above average, very friendly, attentive and happy to recommend different menu items. We started with 2 small apps, the lamb sliders & tacos. The tacos were very flavorful and easily our favorite of the evening. The lamb sliders looked and smelled promising, but were rather dry. I would give these another shot, perhaps ask to have them medium rare (I wasn't given an option). We decided to split the BLT after reading the reviews, I really wish we hadn't. The pork belly wasn't crispy at all and rather bland. Very disappointing, we should've ordered the Apocalypse Sow. There are so many different restaurant options in Scottsdale, I have to say we left underwhelmed. Maybe it was just an off night."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots. The Pig & Pickle is always a great dinning experience. While the menu is always evolving, the staple dishes are always awesome.   The P&P is a great spot for a client dinner, a night out with family and friends, or simply for a quick bite.   Don't skip the Pork shoulder tostadas or the Apocalypse Sow burger. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Thought will try this place for Easter Sunday Dinner. Not happy at all. The Service was great & Our server was ever so nice, but the food portions were a disaster. We were left hungry & had to get food on the way home. It's a good place for people on a diet. Lol. The drinks were not good either. Had a Cocktail that said it was with Ginger Tequila & Ginger Honey. There was nothing that tasted Ginger in there, other than the candied slice of ginger garnish. The drinks were in very small glasses. Not seen those glasses any other place. For $9.50, not worth it. Ordered the Marrow bone. There was no marrow. Just the bone. A huge bone, with nothing inside. What a waste of money that was. Had the pear salad, which was a very small plate, but it tasted good. My Husband had the Mussels in Thai Curry sauce. It was just a bowl full of Coconut milk. No flavor, just watery Coconut milk & the Mussels floating in it. My Husband had to order another meal, as he was still Hungry. I have never been to any restaurant in the US that we have not had food leftover. Here we had nothing leftover. We were in need of more food. And this is after we had a Breakfast & Easter lunch at home. And we are generally not big eaters. So you can imagine the size of the portions. Very Disappointed. Certainly won't be going here again. We live about 30 mins away, but still thought it will be worth the drive. Certainly not. I read the reviews on here & decided to try it out, but I am sorry I have to differ. It's nothing like what people have said on here. We spent almost $100 for 3 people & came home Hungry. Don't waste your time going here. There are better places around, cheaper & bigger portions."}
{"text":"Been twice for lunch.  A casual bar-type place in a strip mall is my kind of place, but unfortunately I just don't like Pig & Pickle.  The cocktails are some of the best around, with a great list and they are very well made; so I do recommend going for cocktails and a snack.  The service is hit or miss - we had an outstanding waitress our first trip but a sloth disguised in hipster guy's clothing our second.  Don't eat the pickles unless you also enjoy eating powdered alum, and be aware they like putting those pickles in a lot of their dishes. The \"tots\" are really hush puppies, and I don't like hush puppies...but I do love tots, so that was a disappointment.  The dump truck salad had greens, carrots, tomatoes and dressing and that was all.  That's fewer ingredients than a Costco salad, and certainly not worthy of the name \"dump truck\".  All the sandwiches and the quinoa salad I tried tasted flat, probably not seasoned correctly, though it was all cooked and plated perfectly.  Sorry, but I can't adequately describe the bad tasting food other than \"flat\".  I didn't finish anything but the broccoli soup which was not flat at all - that soup was very, very good.  But soup and cocktails aren't enough to draw me in again or recommend Pig & Pickle for anything more than drinks."}
{"text":"As a working mom, I don't get out as often as I'd like. I was super stoked that my gno time was spent last week at the Pig and Pickle in Scottsdale.  You pull in to a random strip mall (standard for Scottsdale) and take a step into another world. And it's a tasty world for sure! The tostadas were my favorite. Piled high with shredded pork shoulder and married with fresh slaw and mint....these were, in a word....phenom!  For a nice Jewish girl, I'm actually a bit of an expert on pork shoulder and this was really great.  We also had pork belly...which tasted like a porky fois gras on top of seared pineapple.   The shrimp and grits were good, but not amazing. Im not going to lie, I'm from the south and I can be overly particular when it comes to these two items.   Our service was fab, the atmosphere was hip and dim and there was even a football game on. If they had been playing reggae music all night it would have been five star....oh wait...they WERE playing reggae all night. (And good stuff like Natural Mystic, not just Buffalo Soldier courtesy reggae!)  P and P...I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'd really like to review the food, but I can't because I've been sitting here for over 30 minutes and I'm still waiting for it to come. No acknowledgment or apologies from any of the waitstaff. There are at least three parties waiting to be seated and more than three empty tables... If you have a lot of time on your hands and a lot of patience, come check it out.  Okay the food finally showed up and it actually was REALY good, I have to admit.... Or maybe it just seemed really good cause I was so starving by the time I finally got it..."}
{"text":"I would have had a much better experience if I ordered something else. I was with a few other people and they had already ordered apps which were all fantastic. Especially some sort of pork tostadas that has an Asian flair. Very yummy!   I ordered a Cuban-Esque sandwich but it has SO much horseradish or hot mustard that upon the first bite my tastebuds and sinuses were kaput. It was overwhelming.  I hate sending food back - makes me nervous so instead I just didn't eat. The server never noticed my entire sandwich sitting there untouched either.   We did order desserts. I had a bite of bread pudding and carrot cake. They were phenomenal.   I just can't rate higher with such a flop on my main dish. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"As a foodie I LOVED this place. Bone marrow! Charcuterie, their own pickled eggs...and hard-to-find beers on tap. They grow their own herbs, they source locally, AND the prices were lower than many other restaurants around the Scottsdale area. Oh yes...the breads were amazing!   The wait staff...fun and informative, but SLOW. Like 15-minutes-to-get-a-drink slow. And it wasn't very busy. So that's the only reason it got 4 out of 5 stars. The next time I go back (and I will go back), if the service is faster, I'll up this to 5 stars."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Jen the bartender showed us such personable service along with great bloody Mary's, food is amazing !!.... Burger with duck egg, foi gras and pork belly ... To die for it !!!!! Scott and Tyler amazing team, amazing place ... It's a must !!!!"}
{"text":"Food and adventure, and beer combine in a joyous conflux. The flavors, and personalities are such that they provide for a wonderful foray in modern gastronomy"}
{"text":"The food is eclectic, original, flavorful and never disappointing. The dump truck salad, the duck confit poutine, the pickled everything...all amazing. The servers are fun and knowledgeable, the bartenders have a heavy hand (who doesn't love that!), they're open late and the atmosphere is laid back. All great things in a restaurant. If you decide to try this place, order their carrot cake for dessert. You'll being sending me a thank you message!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Harry Chapin/Ugly Kid Joe - Cats In The Cradle) I arrived to this place just the other day I drove here in the usual way But there were plates to serve and bills to pay I came for happy hour and I ordered away And the server was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he spoke He'd say \"I'm gonna go grab your drinks man\" You know I'm gonna go grab drinks  And the pig & pickle in South Scottsdale Little Asian boy and the mood for some food Comfort style from the home that's rad! Restaurant Week, we'll get together then You know we'll have a good time then  Pig & Pickle offers comfort style food right in South Scottsdale.  A little off from the main strip of Oldtown, but that's all good.  I remember this place when it was the Detour Tavern which obviously didn't work out.  The layout is still the same.  Granite bar table on the South end with the patios outside.  Open kitchen on the Northwest side overviewing the dining room.  The place has a modern homey feel with some art decors I'm guessing from local artist.    I came here during Restaurant Week 2013.  I ordered the Bone Marrow, Ale Cheddar Bacon soup, and the Pork Porchetta, while my sister and her BF order Pork Shoulders, grilled Romaine Salad, and Braised Duck Leg.  Overall, it was a lot of food!  The Bone Marrow was yummy, gelatinous and goowy with pickled and caramelized onions over a crustini. Texture was perfect in my view, soft and goowy with the pungent onions and crusty bread.  My Cheddar Bacon soup, well it was cheddar bacon soup.  Didn't think much of it.  My sister's Pork Shoulder was served like mini sope tacos.  I thought it needed some heat.  My sister BF salad was oddly to say one of my favorites.  It had a nutty dried fruit taste with the crunch from the Romaine.  The egg was added the extra ooze of a texture and the Caesar cheese was mellowed by the sprinkled crushed croutons!  Finally, our main meal was okay at best.  Guess I'm not a big fan of Porchetta, but I thought it could have been roasted more on the outside to add some crispiness to what I would consider the bacon part.  The Fattiness of the pork was okay and the meat was nice and well cooked.  Not too dry, but I guess the fat help it stay moist.  I had to take some home since I was getting too full.  The horseradish mashed potatoes and the pickled cabbage atop I could have done without.  Then again maybe this comfort food is more made for an English man, not the Asian man haha!    In the end, the service is tops.  Very well done and they seem to be knowledgeable about their menu.  Drink fill ups were quick, which in my case is important since I can drink water like no other.  I really enjoyed my visit to the pig & pickle and I really want to continue to come and give this place a chance.  For now, I will have to say a 3 star. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yikes!  Please allow 2+ hours for dining service...  The food is decent and the beer and wine selection is very good however I think the service needs a little attention.  There experience we had there was just... odd.  From the host taking our name for the wait (quoted 25; waited 45 - I get that it's an estimation, just communicate this with the guests).  There was a back room not being used for guest seating and someone had to bring us some chairs because my family and I were sitting up against a wall waiting for our table - the most odd thing about that was that was a perfect spot for some more tables and seating.  I've been there 2 times now and I really would like a good place to thrive there - I hope this feedback is some help..."}
{"text":"I think I over-hyped this place in my mind. A restaurant called Pig and Pickle can only be absolutely mind blowing. All of my friends agreed so of course this is now fact. Unfortunately, my mind was not blown.   We came for the late night menu and Industry discount (15% off!). The atmosphere is open and spacious with subtle pig artwork scattered here and there. It's got a small bar with a great selection of craft beers and high end liquors. The cocktail menu is a bit pricey, but the drinks are well made and pretty damn boozey (the Mai Tai will knock you on your ass).   The service was ... eh. The guy was super nice so I feel bad speaking negatively about him, but facts is facts. The drinks took a noticeably long time to arrive, and I would definitely have ordered a second had the first one not take about ten minutes to make an appearance. Apparently, the bartender was \"spacing out\". I couldn't care less about a spacing out bartender, I just want my alcohol.  The food was good. Solidly good, but like I said, I am not reeling from the foodgasm of piggy goodness. We ordered a round of Tots with their special sauce. For $1 each, get them! The filling changes daily and they're creamy and crunchy and comfort food delicious. Think hush puppy mashed potato mega-tot.   I had a hard time picking my meal because honestly, the whole menu looks awesome. I ended up with a $9 Burger. You've got three choices for cheese- cheddar, swiss or havarti. I went with Havarti and a side salad. After thinking about it, I opted to add Bacon for $2.50. We had an entire conversation about how dumb it would be NOT to add bacon at a Pig place! Yeah well... the guy forgot to add the bacon. Annoying. I wasn't charged for it, but I also really would have liked to eat it. Meh.   After the industry discount and my unnecessarily large, and guilt driven tip, my meal alone cost a little over $20. That's kinda pricey for a late night meal. Especially with such underwhelming service. It's frustrating because I like the guy, and being in the same profession, I understand wanting to be buddy-buddy with a fellow server- but DUDE. Do Not mess up my meal or my drinks. Then and only then can we be friends.   I will come back for sure, but I'm not kicking babies and tossing the elderly out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"Any place that offers cocktails with vinegar is my kind of place! I have been here on multiple occasions and not once have I had a bad experience.   I love the menu design from apps, to entrees and cocktails. I highly recommend anything with pork belly-it is sooooo yummy and fresh."}
{"text":"Our first time here... and definitely not the last time!  LOVE the name of the place, read the reviews, saw the photos... was a teeny bit nervous about the unusual-ness of many of the dishes described on the online menu.  (What if I can't find what I'd like?)   WELL, Forget that!       I really like the interior of the place, it was warm and inviting.  As more people got there, it got noisy a bit, but we are there for the food!   Kat (Cat?) was our server and she was totally perfect.  She smiled, laughed and helped us immensely.  To me, a server is best when they treat us with genuine friendliness and is there to assist in any way.  She was spot on.          As per suggested in Yelp reviews, we ordered the brussel sprouts, pork belly, chicharrones, and our friends had  the pork shoulder tostada and the pickle dish.  We were going at it all, tasting each other's and everything was well worth eating (yes, even the pickled okra!)         I chose the shrimp and grits entree because I'm on the lookout for a favorite shrimp dish.  I was not disappointed, it was delicious and the grits were the smoothest I've ever had, of which I still can't decide which style of grits I prefer.   Other dishes on the table were the BLT, pork shoulder tacos and the trout.   Every one of us was delighted with the dishes.  The servings were generous, adding to the total satisfaction of the experience.       Choosing to try the dessert, we shared ice cream and the rum raisin bread pudding.   I don't know how we finished the dessert, except to say it was soooooo yummy!        Tonight's dinner will not be forgotten.   It was GREAT to try something different and to taste these combinations. Check out the menu online, it's not what they have every night, but you will see that it wasn't just trout, it was \"Crispy skin trout with salt cod, fingerling potatoes, green beans, almonds & brown butter\".        Yep, we will be trying it again!  Thank you to the whole Pig & Pickle team!"}
{"text":"After hearing some buzz on this place we finally got the opportunity to try it this evening. I had seen the menu online and thought it looked enticing and also upscale, so I was surprised when we walked in and the atmosphere was very casual. There are lots of cute and clever pictures and details that give it charm and character, but the tables and seating arrangements aren't exactly comfortable or fine dining.   Our waiter was friendly and got us our drinks promptly, but seemed very busy and to have too much to handle for one guy. We got the cheese and jam app as well as the brussel sprouts and both were good, but not great. The cheese and jam app was $5 during happy hour which was reasonable, but I would not pay full price for it, and the brussel sprouts were $9 and definitely not $9 worth of deliciousness. We ordered burgers with fries, a side salad, and the halibut with corn fritters. The burgers were juicy, but the flavor was not very good (tasted like bad meatloaf); the fries however were excellent. I asked for aioli on the side and for being one of their special sauces it tasted exactly like a blob of mayonnaise. The halibut was well cooked and decent, and the corn fritters were ok. Clever menu, but it is very pricey for the lack of flavor that they serve.   Our waiter was MIA for long periods of time, and got some of our orders a bit off. He corrected it no problem and was very nice, but it took him far too long to get our check among other things. Poor guy just had too many tables and responsibilities to handle by himself. Pig and Pickle is a super cute and clever concept, but it is pretty expensive for mediocre food, casual ambience, and slow service."}
{"text":"if you like PORK, stop here; Pork Shank, Pork Belly, Pork Burger....it goes on and on..my buddy was here on Wednesday, the 11th, and we came back on the 13th....Niman Ranch pork is featured heavily...but do not MISS the: Duck Fat Fried, French Fries....only available after 10....  Christina was an amazing server: beautiful, funny, and so knowledgeable about the menu; ask for the owner, Keenan, to come out, a real true original...  Can not say enough; don't pass up the Elvis Dessert..  Happy holidays!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by for dinner The other night. For having just opened, I thought they were doing a great job.  The service was excellent. We were greeted right away, and our waiter was totally on top of his game and very knowledgable. We really didn't wait for anything.  The food is very decent. I think it will only get better as they get more experienced. We ordered the cod bites, which are good but nothing special. I wanted to try the pork shoulder tostadas, but the boyfriend chose the appetizer dish. I did really like the fries and aioli that came with it, though  He got the pot roast sandwich which he enjoyed ( you must try the tater tot concoction side dish) and I got the duck leg. It was very good, but a bit dry.   The one complaint I have is that they allow smoking on their patio, directly in front of the door. We were seated fairly close to the door, and as soon as someone walked through, we got a huge whiff of it. I absolutely can't stand cigarette smoke, and don't think it has any place near a restaurant, but to each their own. I do think they should force smokers to use a different area of the patio, though.   We will most likely be back, but will ask to sit in a different area. Other than that it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I had pork porchetta.  Delicious (mustard potatoes, house kraut (like a slaw with lots of vinegar - not exactly sauerkraut) pork belly, sausage and ham.  At $24, it was maybe (maybe) a bit overpriced, but it was pretty stellar.  My wife had a burger, which she said was great, and our friend had the Croque Madame which looked ridiculous.    However, it seemed that there was only one or two waitresses for the entire place, so service was really slow at times.  It was about 15 minutes between being seated and ordering food."}
{"text":"P&P saved us weary travelers by being open Xmas Eve. Very friendly service, great split pea soup (which could have been hotter temp wise) and great pork carnitas with pickled veg. Burgers were good but not exceptional. Nice spot overall and a good location."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere with excellent food. Had the eggs Benedict with cholula hollandaise and pork belly on the side- perfection. The hollandaise tastes homemade and while the eggs were sunny up rather than poached they were cooked perfectly. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I thought I loved this place for dinner. Great pork menu items and yummy drinks with desserts to die for (I'm talking to you carrot cake!) but the Sunday brunch here is apparently a well kept secret. Forget the hour long waiting you find a mile away in old town and go here! Croque Madame was delish as was the p&p benedict!! Can't wait to go back for all the menu items that didn't make the first cut!"}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise.  The service was good.  The beer selection was good and they have a full bar.  The food was good and flavorful.  We had the Cuban and the pork belly sandwich.  Both were very good.  The pork belly was slightly over done but not burnt and still good.  The Cuban sandwich was very good.  Good portions but not crazy, we did not leave hungry.  The pickles were really good too, don't skip the pickle like you would in most places.  One suggestion, check in more during the meal.  We would have ordered another round of drinks if given the chance."}
{"text":"Great ambience and nice menu, however the execution left a lot to be desired.  Prices are extremely reasonable.  Just don't ask for any substitutions, you won't get any even if the waiter says they can do it, that left a sour taste in my mouth.  Has potential to easily improve if they can get the kitchen to be able to read a ticket properly or for the waiter to be able to convey your request to the kitchen.  Good selection of beer, wine and booze.  If this place were located in old town Scottsdale it could potentially be the talk of the town however it is located in your typical neighborhood strip mall, which probably allows them to keep prices low and remain off of everyones radar.."}
{"text":"Pig & Pickle knows what's up. When I visited Scottsdale, this was a highly recommended place to try and it definitely did not disappoint. The vibe is very laid back and chill.   Everything on the menu looks super tasty, I couldn't decide what to get!  For appetizers, definitely try the pork shoulder tostadas!! Soooo good. I had 'the nancy' sandwich, my brother had the BLT, and my friend got one of the specials from that night, and everything was delicious. Definitely try the tater tots as a side; they are totally worth the extra $1.50! They're huuuge tots (a little bigger than a golfball), and they change up the filling every day, which I think is really cool.  Tl;dr: try the pork shoulder tostadas and the tater tots"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!! Very helpful when debating on what to eat or drink. :)"}
{"text":"My first visit to Pig & Pickle was an absolute culinary delight.  Being a person partially of Southern heritage, I know a little something about comfort food.  The appetizer I had was very satisfying and had many delicate flavors that worked well together.  My entrée was a symphony of flavors that played well together.  I liked the quality of the meat and the sides.  I also enjoyed the attentiveness of the server (I had that poor man running back to fill my glass of tea quite often).    However, the most memorable thing was the Elvis which was a peanut butter based desert.  I ordered mine without bananas (I detest them) and it went so well with a nice cup of coffee.    Rest assured, I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a food snob paradise without the expensive seating, atmosphere, curtains and taxidermy. It's stark and industrial much like a chipotle set up however do not let that conpatsion taint your tastebuds. I'll start off with a have you tried their cheese plate? If not go back and start over. Every meal is precisely the way they imagine it. I wonder how three magician like chefs get along but a mixologist, a bakery chef and a butcher walked into a bar (rimshot). Every thing has bacon in it beware. Veggie lovers say so because there will always be somthing for us to eat but don't be surprised if you get bacon infused jam. I've never been to a restaurant that had a page long whiskey list. The drink and deserts really stand out. This place is a must visit. Usually for father's or mother's day."}
{"text":"Late night munchies? Need something sweet? Carrot cake extraordinaire! Lots of other wonderful things on the menu . . . but I just couldn't get past what wonderful things can be done to a lowly carrot. (Can I tell you I wanted to lick the plate?)  Watch out for the Bee Sting! It is appropriately named.   Another great place that I knew nothing about. Geez. Thank goodness for friends who know all the best spots to indulge."}
{"text":"It's one of my fav new places! I love comfort food. I know what you are thinkin, why would a vegetarian like me, love comfort food! Well it's the overall package, & it's not like my most fav food, but I like what they do with their okras, hush puppies ( even though it was meant for puppies :p), greens & beans, Mac & cheese, etc. ok enough with the general comfort food, lets talk about P & P.   We went there on a sunday Night, was busy for a sunday night, the place looks interesting inside, looks like a combination of a sports bar and a restaurant but isn't neither. Our waitress was  friendly but a lil' sarcastic maybe? I can't remember her name though ofc. Apparently she can't take it when the customers get indecisive (bcs of the lovely options in the menu) and are not ready to order the food even when she came back like 3 times in 7 mins.   Anyways to the food, my buddy was like woah they have a lot of veggie options for being a pig place. I was hello, remember it has a pickle in it too. :) Oh wait the drinks, aah i posted a pic of their drinks, have a couple of interesting drinks in there. another buddy of mine got a side car, it was meh! I was in mood for something hoppy, so just got myself a left hand IPA. Their beer selection is good as well.   I was contemplating between the vegan burger or the shepards pie. On the waitress's insistence I had to go with the pie. I liked the pie, even though it was bland as it could be. Don't think there was any seasoning in it, but was filling. Had potatoes, lentils, cheese, and stuff in it. I had to add like a bunch of chalula sauce in there to compensate. I am not going to get this again, but I wanna go back to eat the vegan burger, I read that it is bland as well in other reviews, but I will havta try it. oh i am not even gonna try and think what my friends got, ofc all of it had pigs in it, but they did look happy about the food; is what I can muster right now.   Something about this place makes me wanna go again n again. In line with that I wanna go to their HH, or should we say Reverse HH , 10PM onwards everyday. and their desserts will be eaten as well, i hear they are good. Please watch this space for an update then. Until then P & P."}
{"text":"I truly wish I could leave less then 1 star because I feel like that is giving them credit they don't deserve. Where do I start? The Shauty service or the even worse food? I guess you go there for the food and stay for the service right? Well NOT with this place because you will loose both battles. I ordered the eggs benedict and my eggs were so raw that they were basically snot. Then I ordered the Bloody Mary with a Beer back and asked if I could upgrade my vodka and was told I could. So they served me the discusting drink with no beer back and told me I 'forfeited' my beer back when I upgraded to the better vodka. I was so irritated by their lack of service that I asked for a shot of tequilla and was welcomed with 'Last I checked this wasn't a 'Mexican' place so no, no we don't have tequila\" ... My response was 'well you have a Margharita on your menu so it shouldn't be THAT far fethched that I request tequila\" .. I didn't touch my SNOT of a dish and neither did the rest of my party due to the lack of quality and they never for a second thought to fix the issue. I personally have NEVER tipped based off of service and have always tipped 25% of the total bill due to my own beliefs and I am sad to admit that I absolutely refused to give more then the $50 my breakfast costed (that was never eaten) for that horrible service. The Mgr was arrogant and the one who made the \"Mexico\" comment. Im thoroughly saddened by this experience!"}
{"text":"We had made a reservation for a large group and they very very accommodating. The manager was nice, the staff was friendly and the food was awesome.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We trusted fellow Yelpers and we were not disappointed. This place was fabulous and we will eat here on future trips to Scottsdale. Great craft beers. We had wood oven roasted bone marrow and dump truck salad. Entrees were delish, too. We can't wait to try the Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for a late night dinner after landing at PHX. From 10 pm-1 am is happy ending:aka reverse happy hour!! Started with the 6 sweet chili chicken drums...flavor is good!! Next came with the duck duck pig which is French fries Italian style with egg yolk and bacon and ranch dressing...it is super oily but tasty...also got the pork shoulder tostado which was not bad and the udon noodle with veggies...which was really spaghetti but actually pretty good!! Perhaps best dish of the night!!"}
{"text":"First time here and had a great experience.  Packed bar on a Tuesday night.  Had some tasty andouille sausage, sour cream and spinach stuffed tator tots and a couple left hand nitro stouts.  Solid service and friendly folks.  Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Came in late Sunday morning (around 1 a.m.) and got a chance to try the brussels sprouts, duck fat fries, and the Apocalypse Sow pork burger. Everything came out perfectly cooked and made-to-order, and was a huge fan of all the food (except for the mornay sauce on the fries). Other than that, I thought they had a great beer list (bottled and on draft), great service, and better options than most places offer on a late night menu.  Will be back again next time I'm in Scottsdale...well done!"}
{"text":"The Pig & Pickle, formerly a Chinese restaurant and then Detours Tavern, has been completely gutted and remodeled, now seats around 150, and features an open kitchen, a wood-burning oven, a full bar, and a private dining room with a barn door called the \"Pig Pen.\" You can't miss the building from the street.  The menu, features a comfort-food-meets-gourmet. Starters, salads, sandwiches, entrees, and sides like goat cheese and rosemary mac and cheese, crispy duck fat potatoes, and mung bean cakes and ponzu. A braised pork belly starter with yam puree and a Brussels sprout slaw, a duck ham salad, a sandwich sliced pot roast, entrees such as confit pork shank, seared trout, and cioppino stew.  Today, driving home, I blew in for a fast take out sandwich. I ordered the sliced pot roast with caramelized onions, havarti and calabrian chile aioli $10. This meal was excellent, but then again, I will eat anything."}
{"text":"Reserved seating for my husband's birthday.Emailed the place on a Thursday, and no one got back to me until the following Tuesday. My email response only said, \"talk to Cat.\" Called, and the person that answered the phone didn't know who Cat was.  Can we have have seating for 16? We got 12. The server came to our table once in a GREAT while.. I was very polite, and they were \"busy.\" I understand large groups and how it can be horrible sometimes, but this girl didn't even try.  I guess they just had a review in the newspaper so it brought a lot of people in. I have been a bartender. I have been a server. Why did you hire people that don't have personality, or the ability? On to the beer... They were out of Bud Light, Coors light, and two different bottles of wine that we tried to order. ( Side note, we do like good beer: they had an ok beer selection...but the stout I ordered was a horrible 3/4 pour.)We ordered the bone marrow as an appetizer...ehhh. My choice was the \"Nancy\" sandwich and it  was dry...even though it had avocado (which turned out to be guacamole), tomato, and two slices of brie (that were hamburger sized)...whats going on with your food cost on a pound of bri on my sandwich!? My husband had the mussels with chorizo,.. the mussels were just ok, and chorizo was like beef jerky. One friend said the roast beef sammie was ok, but really fatty.Another friend had a pork appetizer that  tasted like a salt lick for deer. We did have a friend that liked the burger and another that like some kind of ham and eggs dish.  No one had silverware. After we asked the server 3 times, SOME people had something to eat with. Three different people were overcharged in our group...which the server was very nice about correcting.  I wanted to like this place. We live in the neighborhood, and it has a charming name!  I couldn't say one nice thing about our experience here."}
{"text":"We came here because they have a daily happy hour and it was pretty cheap for drinks.   I ordered the Jack More Man. I was not the biggest fan of this drink; I didn't think the orange juice went well with the bourbon. I couldn't even finish my drink and that rarely happens.   The service was not great either. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and it was not busy at all. Also, we had just eaten lunch and didn't want to eat anything but our waitress seemed a little annoyed that we didn't order food."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night with my Social Club and jusr about everything was very good.  The mac and cheese dishes and lamb slider were reported as being delicious by several group members.  One of the group members had the steak and loved it.  I had the dump truck salad which was yummy and refreshing, not drowned in salad dressing.  I also got the pork belly appetizer and that was a little bit of a disappointment, I've gotten the pork belly twice before at sunday brunches and it was outstanding.  The appetizer pork belly last night was half yum and half tough and stringy.   Service was attentive and friendly.    I'll definitely be back.  Might give the shrimp and grits a go."}
{"text":"There's lots of great reviews.  I just want to add Best MaiTai I have had in Arizona. EVER."}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of reviews. Only usually when it's really bad or really good. I'm so happy to say, it was EXCELLENT !!!! Thank you Anthony for making this a great experience . Since moving up here from Tucson a little over a month ago, we haven't found any good restaurants we really love until now. Our waiter Anthony made it so easy to order the drinks we wanted and gave us great advice on our lunch . It was great. My boyfriend had the apocalypse sow. Wow! Was all I could say. Had the \"tater tots\" whoever doesn't try these are missing out ! I had the Cuban . The best one I ever had!!!! That's saying slot. I eat out a lot and I'm so happy we stopped . Thank you chef for making GREAT FOOD! We will DEFINITELY BE BACK SOON TO ENJOY DINNER!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm giving this place a 3 stars based on the quality of the food & the customer service.  I do hate leaving below a 4 star review, but I have high expectations when it comes to customer service & dining out.   The food was mediocre at best ( clam chowder was decent ) I could see the potential in this restaurant but unfortunately the flavor was just not there."}
{"text":"Came here with a few buddies for drinks and food. Delicious!  We ordered a charcuterie tray, pork liver smear, bone marrow, and chicharones.   The highlight of the meal was the bone marrow, which a friend described as meat butter. It was incredible and we took whiskey luges out of the bones after.  10/10 will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I are here a few nights ago and I was really pleased with everything. The ambiance and lighting is really nice for dinner, and the concept is simple and unique. I had the mussels with chorizo and they were amazing. Will definitely be back to try some of their whiskey they have a really extensive selection."}
{"text":"These guys know what they are doing. Awesome experience from beginning to end. I got to go pork crazy and my vegetarian girlfriend was able to have a great meal too. Stellar beer selection  Our sever went above and beyond what was expected. Just a wonderful experience all around."}
{"text":"I must say, this place is perfect for my husband. It has relaxed atmosphere but yet gourmet food. He had bone marrow appetizer, shrimp and grits main course, and froie gras for dessert. I had the pork belly appetizer and the Cuban missile sandwich. The service has been incredible from our waiter to the owners (both have come and talked to us many of times). The music also had a great vibe. We drove 30 minutes to check this place out and are very happy we did. We will make the drive again!"}
{"text":"Unreal experience. My girlfriend and I had always drove by this place and wanted to try. Finally did. The food was incredible. Matt (the bartender) was amazing. He made perfect recommendations, checked up on us frequently, and gave us complimentary dessert. I would highly recommend giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight and it was different  from every other experience I have ever had at Pig & Pickle. This was just upsetting. The server didn't have much time for our table and actually let us know that. The food was good as usual, but the service ruined my night. I'm disappointed. Worst birthday dinner ever."}
{"text":"Service and staff were great. Very friendly and accommodating. However, The food was awful! The atmosphere was \"OK\" for the prices I expected a Lil more elegant space... From the outside it seems upscale, on the inside it feels like a comfortable dive type bar. Seems as though they're trying to create an upscale menu for \"Scottsdale\", but falls short in atmosphere, location and food. The fish was a small portion and a bit over cooked, the burger had a burnt grill taste and no mayo in the building??? and the Fries were WAAAAY overdone. When  we asked about it they said they were supposed to be that way... double fried :/ Yuck, and completely Inedible. Few beers on tap, and the four peaks beers come in a CAN... and it was Gross! Possibly there are other items on the menu that would be better But We are unwilling to give them another try at those prices. My suggestion is don't waste your money, there are better options in Scottsdale for price, atmosphere and comfort ability"}
{"text":"Ok I wanted to give this place more stars based on just looking at the menu, but either I may have ordered a couple of things that just didn't suit my fancy or it wasn't quite what I expected. Will be back to try again. Ordered the charcuterie plate which I thought would be meat, cheese, and bread, but no cheese was present.  I felt that this took away from the plate. There were two meats  that were good- but the rest unimpressive and due to strange textures of the meat, made me feel slightly ill. The pretzel bread and other breads were however delicious. Ordered the goat cheese with sour plums- lacked some flavor and once again the texture was unusual. Not bad, just not my favorite.  The pork burger was great- holy meat! Fries were delicious.  Restaurant was way too loud for my taste, until it got a little later in the evening. Servers were very attentive."}
{"text":"Boo. So disappointed! We waited well over one hour for cold, thick soup and flavorless main dishes. We had a large party and the waiter said it was his first night but we never saw a manager or someone to help him out! I had to take my food to go and leave separately from my family because our meal took so long. No apologies from the manager."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place out... But it didn't really blow me away. Average food. Drinks were good though."}
{"text":"A delayed wait is understandable but waiting 20 minutes at the table to be acknowledged is not. The food might have been good if we had a chance to speak to someone who worked there. When we asked if we could place our order with someone clearly paid a wage to be there we were told \"not with me.\" Left to Lo Lo's Chicken & Waffles instead."}
{"text":"I have been to Pig & Pickle twice. The first time was for a large birthday party. They put us in the back room which was awesome because we were all dressed up for a Rock n' Roll theme and we were quite the noisy bunch. Service was pretty good considering our large group, I was pleasantly surprised! And the food.... the pork shoulder was really good!!   My second time at P&P I shared a couple of items, the apocalypse sow and a burger the waiter created himself. Everything was delicious, but really heavy... you need to come very hungry! The waiter was interesting and all over the place. He was helpful in choosing drinks and food, but he wasn't your typical waiter.   Bottom Line: Come hungry, expect to leave stuffed with deliciousness, and don't be too frightened by the weird waiter!"}
{"text":"We had high expectations... everything was way too sweet. Too many things all mixed together that don't belong together. The bread was good, but the cheese dip was very sweet instead of salty. Not impressed by the pork tostadas. The smoked salmon spread was good. Enjoyed the wine. Nice atmosphere. Great service. The food just didn't do it for us."}
{"text":"I was excited to have this place open literally across the street from my home. To be fair, I visited twice before writing a review. 1st visit was great; waiter was super friendly, attentive and helpful. With 5 of us in our party, we had plenty to sample and all was delish (pot roast sandwich, rock shrimp salad, pork belly, mussels etc). Fast forward to last night and this is where it goes from 4.5 stars to 3. I think this place has a case of identity crises. They need to figure out who they are, what they do well, and stick with it. As opposed to my first visit, last night's was disappointing: a frazzled somewhat disinterested waitress (even though the place was practically empty) as well as complete inconsistency in the food had me come to the decision that I am done with P & P for awhile. Food was barely warm, flavors were uninteresting, and all the shredded \"meats\" tasted the same with a somewhat mushy texture. I made the mistake of ordering the seared tuna and noodle salad. The tuna was cooked as opposed to seared and the dressing was flavorless. My mother and I both ordered the diver scallops in creamed corn \"drizzled\" in some sort of chili oil. My scallops, as an appetizer, had a ratio of chili oil completely different than my mother's (her scallops were swimming in chili oil). Again--consistency is a problem. In addition, I have decided that I don't care for the ambience of this place. I find it cold, sparse and somewhat of an afterthought. I couldn't help but notice that the laminate surface of a few of the tables is already peeling or breaking off around the corners. Yes, I am picky, but after receiving  $135 bill for 4 at happy hour and one drink per person, I think I have the right to be. Bottom-line: meh. I can live without this place. There are too many great places in Scottsdale to eat to settle for meh."}
{"text":"Delicious smells when you enter! Great food and I love the atmosphere. This is one of my top places in the area!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife at around 4:30 for an early dinner and to catch happy hour.  We're in town visiting and I found this place on yelp and it tipped my curiosity.  I'm a big fan of charcuterie and this looked like a great spot.     We arrived and being it was pretty early the dining room was pretty empty at this point but we expected this.  The place has a cool feel to it.  Bar to the left with bar seating and a few high top tables and a larger dining room to the right  where you can see into the kitchen.  They have a pretty killer happy hour menu.  We got the dump truck salad and the char plate for 5 bucks a piece which is probably the best deal in town.  Not only was it a great deal the food tasted amazing.  That would normally be enough to eat but since we were here to eat we ate.  My Wife ordered the scallop dish and I ordered the braised pork belly with apple butter and the roasted bone marrow.  Everything was absolutely amazing.  The service was spot on and delightful making our experience here fantastic.  Thanks Pig & Pickle!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Pig and Pickle a couple of times now. The first time I ordered the dump truck salad as I am not a meat eater but my friend was. The salad was fresh and large and the dressing was fresh as well. My friend had the Pot Roast sammie which he stated was very good. The service was very good  although it was restaurant week, we were able to get in and out in a timely manner.   I went again last night with my brother I decided to try the vegetarian burger which came with fries, it was very good and flavorful with some fresh veggies on top and good temperature the fries were hot and fresh as well. My only complaint would be the fries were extremely salty. I used the hot sauce to tone down the salt a bit. I am a type of person that will not send food back for any reason, and we were also in a hurry. My brother ordered the Pot Roast and he stated that this was very good. We did not order drinks but I have had their drinks in the past which is a good selection of wine and beer.   For the price you get good service and food, my only suggestion would be is to not add any salt to the fries and have salt and pepper on the tables along with serving the condiments with the food so the wait staff does not have to make several tips for condiments along with not having to wait to eat your food waiting for the condiments.   For vegetarians they have the nancy'...brie, avocado, tomato and shaved red onion on garlic rubbed bread ,the dump truck salad and  the vegetarian burger. Not too many choices but at least you can find something on the menu."}
{"text":"First and probably last time here. The service was really good and beer list was pretty good. However food was at best very average --everything was drowning. The udon noodle entree was drowning in sauce and more like a soup.  Pulled pork entree =drowning ... it was going to be a 3 star review until my partner went to the restroom on the way out . Disgusting . Clearly no deep cleaning here since opening day. See photo for just one example..."}
{"text":"Always great food & great vibes! My friends and I usually sit at the bar and order take out. I also get the tostada with the fries. Never disappoints me EVER!!! The fries come with duck fat dipping sauce might sound gross but think again, cause it's amazing."}
{"text":"I have drove by this place for months and wanted to try it and we decided to finally give it a try to celebrate a birthday. We came in right before it got busy and we had no idea that happy hour was just beginning. Happy hour is from 4-6pm daily and I believe the restaurant is closed Mondays. We ordered a few $5 appetizers; pork belly tacos, a cheese platter, and a ham pulled pork baguette sandwich. The food was amazing! I almost drooled on myself eating one of those tacos. Eating here taught me how badly I had previously been neglecting my taste buds. We also tried two of their beers which were tasty but I don't recall which kind. Our server was friendly, quick, and helpful. The menu changes everyday I believe.  I love this and can't wait to return to try more dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the P& P this morning and sat at the bar with Matt! We are bar people so that is our 'usual'. Anyway---he was SUPER knowledgeable on the entire menu...suggested things, drinks, food and even a tasting menu which we will take him and the chefs up on. Incredible service though- and INCREDIBLE food! LOVED! We had the siracha hollandaise Benni & the FML chicken breakfast burrito- it was divine!!! We loved our bloody with the beer back and the pepper and salt rim! MMMM! Love!!! Thank you for your fab service and the food! Cannot wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Brussel sprouts with pork belly, poutine, chicken wings, & sow burger all from late night menu hit the spot. Nice $5 drinks & good food prices. Great service & food by Jake & the gang. Only bummer were the less-than-satisfying sweet pickles (tasted like cucumbers that were only halfway to becoming pickles). Will return"}
{"text":"We just used their catering service and rented the backroom and had a perfect experience.  Let me first say that our group was for 50 plus people and most are drinkers and foodies.  The menu items we selected ranged from the charcuterie to salmon rolls and pork belly skewers.  Everyone indulged and raved about the quality and presentation.  We had such a great turnout that we overspiled in the restaurant and the server was so on target taking care of everone.  She really could work the room seamlessly.  We would recommend the catering and will rebook soon to host since we know it will be a great event."}
{"text":"If you're on a diet avoid this place like the plague. It's loaded with amazing food, good service and strong booze. Don't even get me started on the desserts. Also, the music they were playing when I went in for lunch was awesome. Rock n roll and copious amounts of meat are the perfect match. Go here, stuff your face and shave some years off your life. It's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Chef's Keenan Bosworth & Josh Riesner bring their unique style to a great location in South Scottsdale. Living in the area, and being a craft beer lover, I spent much time over at Papago & AZ Wine, and was treated to some of the culinary delights that these two create. I was extremely excited to hear that they were going to bring their wonderful food to a menu that I can afford. Show me a better late-night menu in town...   The place has a great decor, that took the existing layout and really incorporated the personalities of these guys. My first experience there was fantastic! Gulden Draak (98 rated on Ratebeer AND served in it's proper glassware) on tap, as well as another tasty European beer, Konig Ludwig. My first beer was free, as I was surprised to see my name on the top of the 'Give & Take' board by the bar. The concept is very cool, a good friend of mine, had previously purchased a beer for me to reclaim at any time. We had time to enjoy the brews, as the service was slow, but this was their first week, and Rome wasn't built in a day. Girlfriend and I shared a small 'Pickled Things' appetizer, while we waited for her favorite, risotto gnocchi with mushrooms, and my Wisconsin cheddar broccoli brown ale soup. Both were delicious, and made better by ordering a side of the homemade bread with smoked butter. We were both getting full, so weI decided to split the Nutella ice cream with brownie and toasted marshmellow. Now I don't typically order dessert, but this made me glad we did. Keep up the good work guys, planning on coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Went here in April with my family for the first time and BOY! If you like meat, this is your place! Their menu is limited but since my family likes to pick at everyone's dish I tried them all and they were cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious.  I was surprised by how little customers were in there but I can see why since their location isn't the best. Every other restaurant was booked solid so we stumbled across this on Yelp and I'm glad we did."}
{"text":"Pig & Pickle is extremely, extremely good. They have a fun obsession with sneaking pig into as many items as they can that fortunately doesn't carry over to the pickle side of things, which I'm thankful for.  I had their lovely pork belly appetizer and their amazing burger. Amazing because it was charred on the outside, in such a way that when it was first delivered, I was worried they had screwed the pooch on \"medium rare\". Except that as I cut into it, it broke into an example of the most radiant, beefy splendor, perfectly cooked, with no ketchup necessary. A perfect tomato, the right amount of lettuce, and some delicious cheese. This, my friends (and to paraphrase a scene in How I Met Your Mother) is a BURGER.  Their desserts were great as well, and everyone really loved their slightly different take on things and quirky menu options. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"1st time here and we arrived at 12:30am so the gave us the \"late night\" menu.  The late night menu is filled with a dozen or more fantastic choices (no wimpy late night menu here!).  We ordered the Country Fried Buffalo Chicken Sammie, Apocalypse Sow, and the P&P Poutine.  All 3 dishes were on point!!  If your like me and enjoy a little kick, the Buffalo Chicken did not disappoint.    What a great find: with a great selection of craft brew and good food that's open late....how can you go wrong?!?  Side note: Also our waiter Jake was very friendly despite being so late on a Saturday night.  We can't wait to come back and try items on the full menu!"}
{"text":"Definitely a different menu, but man the food is totally awesome.  Small bar, but has great bartenders and beer selection."}
{"text":"Delicious food and good customer service! The pickled appetizer we ordered was amazing!  Good beer and wine selection as well!"}
{"text":"It was with great excitement that I visited Pig & Pickle last Saturday. I went inside with wide eyes and the enthusiasm of a child on Christmas. Something so urban and hip in my little neighborhood of South Scottsdale! Yes, please and thanks in advance.  After dining, I am actually a little torn. There was stuff that was absolutely outstanding, and stuff that was just plain not good.  I'll start with the outstanding.  I personally don't really eat pork OR beef, but I figured when in Rome... I ordered the pot roast sammie, and seriously, I thought I was going to pass out from deliciousness. It tasted just like the amazing, tender pot roast that my mom used to make. It was topped with creamy cheese and caramelized onions. I'll be hard pressed to venture out and try anything new because this was just soooo good.  We also ordered desert after our meal, which if that is all I was reviewing this would be five stars without hesitation. The deserts were creative, delicious, not outrageously sized and are leaving me salivating just thinking about them.   The beer list was long, and the server was happy to offer recommendations. He was generally a friendly guy and explained the menu well when we had questions.  Now for the just plain not good....  Unfortunately, I have to mirror the sentiments of other reviewers and say that while very friendly, the service was poor. Wait times were long even though the place wasn't packed, and we sat with a table almost completely covered in empty dishes for most of our meal. We almost cleaned off our own table at one point just to have some room, but luckily our server eventually figured it out. I hate to say that because he was very nice, but they missed the mark on some basics of service.  The tots. I feel like I'm going to be mobbed for saying this, but to me- they weren't good at all. Maybe I was disappointed after assuming I'd get a traditional \"tot\", or maybe the tot of the day wasn't my fave, but I could only manage to eat half of one.  The tot was a \"Philly Cheesesteak\" and to me it was less tot and more fried mashed potato ball with peppers and steak. Not good, unfortunately. I will be totally open to trying them again in the hopes that the flavor of the day just didn't do it for me.  The cost wasn't outrageous but maybe a little high for the neighborhood. I didn't mind paying it, but some might balk at the prices.  Overall, I will be back, and am looking forward to it. I just know what I'll avoid this time. Hopefully they get their service in check and get their processes streamlined. I have faith in this place, and I hope it inspires other creative, indie eateries to spring up in South Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The service is very slow.  Takes a while before they acknowledge you even.  The bartender is quite \"full of himself\".  Asked for a gin called #209 and he scoffed and said it was not worthy of their drink program.  Since we live close by I asked if he would bring it in....long stare and a flat \"NO\" and then he walked away.  tisk-tisk  I am the one paying the bill.  Put me off and no desire to return.  Their Mai Tai was expensive but  pretty tasty.    The food is creative, too bad it is being ignored due to lousy service and huffy head-bartenders."}
{"text":"I went to the Pig & Pickle for a dinner out with friends this past weekend.  We were a large group that was easily accommodated for by the staff.  There was plenty of seating in the restaurant, and a back area that made the large group setting more comfortable.    I shared several dishes with friends so I'll list them off with my opinion but as you can tell by my overall review I was very satisfied with my experience.  When my mid-western parents come to visit in a month I'm absolutely bringing them here for dinner.  The menu was fancy but the atmosphere was causal.   Important to know - the portion sizes are large, even on the starters.  I wasn't aware of this when I started ordering and as you can see from the list, I was very full after dinner even though I was sharing.  The same goes with the actual dinners and sandwiches, expect to take home leftovers if you aren't starving.  ...Smoked Salmon, tater tot, fennel, lemon crema - If you love smoked salmon, then this is the best thing to get.  It was light but savory.  The lemon crema really made it special.  I would absolutely get this again.    ...braised pork belly, yam puree, brussel sprouts slaw and blis maple - This is just fabulous if you want two slabs of pork fat.  I'm not complaining, because who doesn't love pork fat, but it was a bit heavy when paired with the other heavier dishes.  ...wood oven roasted bone marrow, crostini and onions - I think this was the smallest portion size of all the dishes but with the strongest flavor.  I've never had bone marrow before this dish so I can't say if it was good or not.  The presentation was great and I enjoyed the experience.  ...cool beets salad (name too long) - I love beets, and I loved this salad.  Without question I will order this again.  It was light and pleasant, a great start.  It isn't big enough for a solid meal, but great to split with someone and a small appetizer.  ...lamb dish that was a special from the chef - cooked very well, with a fishy taste.  Anchovies are part of the meal (in the sauce though, no actual visual fish) and they really over powered the dish.  I liked it but heavy, so when added with the bone marrow and the pork belly I was over run with heavy dishes.  ...Seared carrot cake - BEST CARROT CAKE EVER.  I don't typically like carrot cake.  I typically find it fine, good enough, nice with some cider and fall weather.  This though, was the best I've ever had.  The seared surface really make the texture fantastic.  It had a deep flavor and a nice light goat cheese frosting.  The serving size is large, share this with someone.  ...little elvis desert - I wasn't a huge fan of this one, I think the most disappointing thing I tried.  IT was a nice concept, the bacon was too disappointing though, realy should have been a thicker cut but looked more like a piece of bacon on a fast food burger."}
{"text":"Incredible service and food. The pickle, turned pig, logo is what initially lured us in. With such clever iconography, how could we not scope out the gastropub? As we browsed the menu and bonded with the restaurant's mission of serving the best organic food, we were caught between different Sammies. Would the Peruvian mustard satiate us tonight or the steak? Alas, all of it would. Boasting its selection of specially brewed beer, the restaurant led us to try some of the carefully crafted IPAs. And if you don't finish with the strawberry compote pie, you're just not ready to accept all that heaven has to offer the earthlings. We? New Yorkers? are in love with this spot. Thanks for making our evening."}
{"text":"Very decadent! We loved everything we had (except for the rocky road dessert).  The casoulet was perfect. The fish and chips were a little too simple for me. I would have preferred a true tartar sauce rather than the basic mayo I got. The apocalypse sow burger was very tasty."}
{"text":"Great late night. Great whiskey selection. Locally owned. Always add pork belly... yes, to everything."}
{"text":"Wow what a find for metro phoenix.  Great food, decent atmosphere, tremendous service. If you can get there before 6pm they have happy hour daily which almost cuts your check in half.  Coming back early and often.  The soups are over the top amazing and the bone marrow dish is a must try."}
{"text":"We love this neighborhood restaurant! The chefs come up with some amazing combinations that are fresh and unique. I love how they have a different tater tot every day. I've never had a bad one! The pork belly tostada is delicious and I love the kimchi on it. I wish they were open for lunch. I'm glad to see all the positive reviews... Hopefully that means this restaurant will be around for a while!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Came here for brunch and had an omlete. Can't remember what it was called but it had this amazing cheese and a cranberry chutney on top. It was amazing. I would highley recommend coming for their brunch!"}
{"text":"We had brunch at the Pig & Pickle it was amazing! We'll be back for sure. I had the Fennel, arugula, tomato, and a cheese (I can't recall which kind)... omelet with bacon. This also came with some seasoned cubed potatoes and I ordered a side of salsa. Omelet was cooked perfectly and the salsa was a fresh green salsa with tomatillo's I believe. My other half ordered the french toast with fresh peaches. Beautiful food, great service (Thanks Jake!), and a comfortable environment, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I feel like it is weird for me to like this place since I'm not a pork eater!! Lol but they have some awesome stuff!! First my favorite is there cilantro margarita  with sirracha- you think this would be weird because I did and my friend made me try it... I'm hooked.. I'm dream of these things they are so good!! The Brussels sprouts are just unreal- crispy with sprinkled cheese and a friend egg!  Not a fan of the green chili Mac and cheese- not a lot of flavor and wasn't hot at all.  Now I am admitting to have tried the pork- the tostadas and pork belly tacos are seriously unreal. They almost converted me over."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night food run with friends, great place. We got pretty much every appetizer on the menu, and there wasn't one thing we didn't like. The atmosphere is nice, everyone was drinking and having a good time. The wait staff were helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"I am struggling with 4 or 5 stars here.  I settled on 4 because I am not entirely sold on all aspects of this place but I will be back.  First, THE best fries I have ever had.  My friend had them with pate over them and I had them with pork belly - both with a nice aioli.  I didn't try the pate because my friend didn't seem keen on sharing.  She said she obsesses over it and has been there several times for it.  I enjoyed the crisp pork belly and those insane fries.  I also shared the bread and cheese platter and it was very good - excellent bread!  The cocktails were fantastic!  I tried the Brussels but decided that I am not a fan of cheese with Brussels...theirs have Asiago on them.  And the menu seemed a bit limited to me but I am picky and they don't allow substitutions.   Staff was really friendly, cute place, and I am looking forward to another visit!"}
{"text":"Great service .. we came here for the first time to celebrate our 26th anniversary and enjoyed everything!Manager comped our table with a bottle of champagne and made our night even more special."}
{"text":"The FOOD is AMAZING!!! This place is all the rave. Tostadas were my favorite thing ever. They also have French pressed coffee which is to die for. We had the best time at the place. Scottsdale doesn't have too many foodie spots so this is a nice addition. Very creative and tasteful dishes. Definitely love the theme. Nothing better than good pickled apps with protein. Loved this place!!!"}
{"text":"There's bad service, and then there's service that makes you go \"booooo-sheeeyt!\"   Imagine you tell the waitress that 3/4 of your table is vegetarian/vegan/Kosher right at the beginning of the meal. Cool. Done.  You ask about the tots of the day and she says they're chile verde... fair game. You eat the tots, and you're all like, \"This tastes like dead thing.\" And then she's like, \"Oh yeah, there's pork in those.\"   So then you're mortified and apologetic to your dinner guests and just trying not to yell a Ludacris-style \"WADAF*****CK?!\"  She takes them away and you go, \"Uhh, can we just have fries instead?\" So she brings them out, and then charges you for the tots AND the fries. No.  Boooooooooo-sheeeeeeeyt."}
{"text":"Stopped by after the Phoenix Open yesterday and we were in HOG HEAVEN.  For apps got the pork shoulder tostadas and the oven roasted bone marrow. Both were excellent but the marrow was to rich for me.   For entrees we ordered the braised pork shank and braised duck leg. The shank was a sight to behold and tasted great. The duck meat was also delicious and the meat was tender and sweet.  For desert we ordered the seared carrot cake. I'm not a carrot cake fan but this one was very good and I would definitely order it again.   We are already looking forward to our next visit when we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant/bar in the entire world. I know that's a bold statement but it's 100% true. I've been a very frequent diner here over the past year and it just keeps getting better. Pig & Pickle is always looking to add new delicious eats to their incredible menu. I like to try as many things as possible on their menu but a few favorites I always go back to are their signature pork tostadas, fried brussels sprouts with asiago and a farm fresh egg (I recommend adding bacon), and for brunch, their p&p benedict.   Every time I go in I also always order a couple of their tots which contains different ingredients every day. My favorite dessert is their Strawberry Vinegar Pie which is not always on the menu so if it's there, you MUST order it. The name is deceiving but trust me and thank me later. All their other desserts are delish, you can never go wrong with the Elvis or the Mississippi Mud Pie.   I could go on and on but I don't want to give away all the secrets to this place I could call my second home. The bartenders have concocted a very fun palette pleaser of a cocktail menu in addition to all the great beers they feature from microbreweries. The staff have become great friends that I look forward to seeing every time I walk in.   If I could give this place 10 stars, I would."}
{"text":"This place always has amazing tots. My husband I love going there with friends. The best part is that they are open late and have a wonderful patio area!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place, as we drive past on our way to our daughters house. Husband was craving a BLT so I suggested we try it. Wow, so happy we came by. Hubby had the BLT. I had the Brussels sprouts, extra crispy and the Seared Foie Gras. (Dang was that delicious!!!!). And, they have homemade cinnamon ice cream. It's like the chef knows very thing I covet and love!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Awesome service and amazing food!!! The pork tostadas are a MUST HAVE! I don't remember our servers name but she has long dark blonde/brown hair (usually in a braid) and she wears glasses. Such a hands on server and as a fellow server I really appreciate that."}
{"text":"What a niche little place. The drinks are from scratch, beers on tap have a great variety and daily food specials. The Friday night band is talented and interact with diners to keep the night lively. Best part, dog treats for my pup."}
{"text":"We kick ourselves for not coming here more often! My hubby and I came here to try their happy hour and we are glad we did! $5 wines - yes please!!! We ordered the green chili mac and added bacon -- Delicious Fried pork skins (chicarones) - crunchy salty goodness Pork slider - just okay...too much bread side of foie gras - Amazing  and the show stopper - the Brussels Sprouts with an egg on top plus pork belly on top. Nom Nom Nom Nom!!!  What really made all dishes amazing with an extra kick of bad ass was HOMEBOYS HOT SAUCE. We were so happy that they sold this local product here and bought a bottle. My hubby and I are hooked on this sauce.   Thanks Pig & Pickle. You can count on us on becoming regulars."}
{"text":"Another Great dinner at P&P.  We had a small hiccup during service, but our server and the management address it and all was forgiven.  Our server, Cat, was AMAZING.  She made great recommendations that the table talked about for the rest of the night.  She recommended the special, a Pork \"Chicken Wing\" which everyone raved over (sorry, I'm not a wing girl).  In closing, THEY HAVE PUMPKIN PORTER ON TAP!  ON TAP IN JUNE!  I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL.  Their management is smart like a fox and set aside 2 kegs when they got it in last fall.  Not sure for how long but this is your warning to get there now!"}
{"text":"The service was great. Strong interesting cocktails. My rib-eye was pretty good. I had a bite of the pork shoulder tostadas, which were delicious. I tried the Elvis gelato, which was interesting, but didn't really work for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years. We are obsessed with their brunch!! But dinner and late night are equally incredible! Never have we been disappointed with our food selections! They had a s'mores pie on their breakfast menu one time, I've been craving it ever since! The bacon and pork belly are a definite go to! It is also a requirement to try one of their drink creations when we are in! The only reason I'm giving P&P 4 stars is that for some reason the service is often lacking. I have learned to drink my water slowly because most of the servers we have had will not refill it! Regardless, we always come back to try out their new delicious menu items.  Update: The husband and I have come back a few more times with friends. Food still innovative and delicious. Service has definitely stepped it up. Everyone on both visits was very awesome and attentive!!! Grateful for full water glasses! Thanks P and P"}
{"text":"Most creative meal in town.  Chacuturie plate as good as Vincent's on Camelback. Great cocktail and craft  beer menu in a comfortable setting. We'll be back and again."}
{"text":"Was informed by my co-workers of this place so I decided to give it a try. The place has a nice atmosphere and the servers are very welcoming. My sister ordered the steak bavette and I ordered the duck and a bowl of clam chowder. We decided to add one of their popular appetizers brussel sprouts as well. We received our soups first and the clam chowder was only luke warm but the flavoring was great. Then they brought out our appetizer brussel sprouts and WOW... It was the best brussel sprouts I've ever had. My duck was mediocre but the steak bavette my sister got was really good. This is a great place to dine in and good atmosphere. I will be returning soon!  *must try the Brussel sprouts*"}
{"text":"Right when we walked in, we felt welcomed by Clayton (the owner) and Zach the bartender was amazing ... Our first time .. everything was perfect .. We had the chicharrones, bone marrow and foie gras.. We cannot wait to come back .. Pig & Pickle is going to be one of our favorite dining choices..come with a big appetite and prepare to be impressed ."}
{"text":"I went to Pig and Pickle tonight for one reason....to get the veggie burger with bacon....did I get that? nope.... When the BF and I got there, we realized it was happy hour and I could not resist 5$ plates. We asked the waitress what the best item on the happy hour menu was and she said the bahn mi.....I was skeptical because it had liver on it (eeeek), but decided to try it. It was actually fairly good! The pork was a little mushy and looked really gross, but the veggies added a good amount of flavor and crunch to the sandwich...I couldn't really taste the liver. After eating half this sandwich, there was no way I could get the burger....way too much food. So the BF and I decided to share a couple more happy hour items including the tacos and the beer cheese dip (much healthier and lighter, right? ha.) The taco was fairly disappointing because it had that same mushy pork on it with mushy refried beans and nothing crunchy to change the texture....just mush....not awesome. The beer cheese was ok, but again, had kind of a weird texture....it says it comes with things to dip in it which is 99% bread....not exactly what I expected. Overall, I just didn't think it was amazing, BUT I still want to give them another chance by trying a real meal here because I like that they use a lot of local ingredients and make a lot of their ingredients fresh (like bread and whatnot)."}
{"text":"We had heard great things about this place so were excited to give it a try.   Unfortunately it was one thing after another.   - Bored hostess could barely summon the Energy to welcome us. - A server that had paid no attention to our table and when he did seemed to be very distracted.  - Over hyped tater tots were average at best.  - Slow roasted pork was bland and without any typical characteristics that we were looking forward to.  - Tasteless fish and chips. I know the fish isn't meant to be that strong a flavor but you're meant to taste something right? - White wine that came out tepid and once cheap wine gets warm it's undrinkable.   You get the idea. It was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Phenomenal.   This place is a taste sensation. Every single thing we ate was perfectly balanced and delicious. The server was so attentive, but yet invisible, ie: taking away used plates and we didn't even notice.   We had the buffalo sauce pork shanks with blue cheese crumbles to start. This could've been my whole meal it was that good.   My fiancé had the shrimp tots, so tasty with the beef brisket. Amazeballs.  I had the hanger steak with a duck egg side......5 stars!!  We meant to go to another place that had pig in the name, but are so glad we stayed at this place instead. Fantastic food you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Unassuming from the parking lot, this vibrant local hangout is definitely worth checking out.  We stopped in on a weeknight and found the place buzzing with activity. The atmosphere was great and the locals and first timers seemed to mix well. The beer list is great, and the variety and creativity of the mixed drink list is intriguing too."}
{"text":"Featured on Check Please, Arizona and just minutes from my house. Couldn't wait to try it. Stopped by today at 5 p.m. before a class.  Ordered Shrimp & Grits w/Chorizzo--imagined a creamy plate of grits with shrimp and a dots of ground chorizo. Instead, was presented with a deep bowl of red-sauce drowning the grits (could barely see the grits) 5 large shrimp dotted the top with wafer thin slices of burned sausage. The sausage was so badly charred and bitter, I chewed, but couldn't swallow--left it buried in my napkin. The shrimp was okay, but not worth the price of the entree'.  I was dining alone; after delivering my bowl of drowning grits, the waiter never stopped by again to inquire on my satisfaction; no refills on my glass; had to flag him down for the bill. $24.00 later (for entree' and one glass of iced tea), I walked out thinking well, you don't have to go back. P.S. -- the fan in the restroom hasn't changed--it's still caked with dust and dirt."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food, round up to 4 for the service. For a restaurant called Pig and Pickle, you would expect their pickles and pork dishes to be amazing. However, we were slightly disappointed with some of the dishes we encountered.   For appetizers, we started out with the bone marrow, the Shishito peppers, watermelon blue crab salad, and pickles. The Shishito peppers were full of flavor and pretty good, I don't eat peppers often so it was a nice change. The sauce was a little on the salty side though. The watermelon blue crab salad was more interesting than good. A really unique mix of flavors, but it was okay. The bone marrow was our favorite of the appetizers, the marrow was very meaty and flavorful, but the salsa didn't exactly match with the marrow. Last but not least, the pickles. There were pickles green beans, egg, grapes, mushroom, okra, and pickles. The grapes were surprisingly really good pickled, it was a nice combination of sweet and sour. It was cool getting to try all of the different types!   For entrees, we shared the duck, pork shank, and the mussels. The pork was really basic. Buffalo sauce, blue cheese. It wasn't that good. Really disappointed in this dish. The mussels were fresh, but the chorizo was thinly cut and super chewy. It was not bad. However, it was the duck that saved the day. The duck was cooked a perfect medium rare and it was so tender and juicy! Paired with the pears and nuts, this dish was absolutely delightful!!   The total came out to be around $120 for four people as we also got a few drinks. Pretty cool how they age their own whiskey here; I would recommend ordering their drinks! They have two partners who opened this restaurant- one specialized in food and the other in bar tending which is super cool. The service was fantastic, and we had a good time!"}
{"text":"Three of us ate here last night and all had an excellent meal.  Cocktails, appetizers, entrees and doggie bags for around $100.  What more can I say?"}
{"text":"Love this place. Dog friendly ... Rotating beers on draft. The staff is super knowledgable about the menu. Menu is a little weird but every thing I've had so far was good. I recommend this place! Chill environment - definitely would visit again."}
{"text":"What a refreshing surprise. This place is pretty darn good. The food depending on what you order will make you happy or happier. The drinks are an A+. Loved it so much was thinking about a trip to AA. We had the strawberry vinegar pie and let's just say nobody's grandma I have ever known makes this pie and it is really worth the try. Stop in definitely have a drink and dessert! Ask for  Nate we thank him for great customer service."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, service, and food. Pay attention to the schedule as they close the kitchen to break down for the next service (lunch ends at 2:00 pm and appetizers start at 3:00 pm)."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour (daily 4-6pm!).  We sat at one of the tall tables near the bar instead of at the bar itself. Our server was friendly and efficient.   I enjoyed the Tarragon Lemonade (Tarragon Gin, Tarragon Syrup, Fresh Sour) but thought it could use a counterpoint to balance the flavors - maybe rosemary or lavender?  The Bramble On (Gin, Blackberry syrup, fresh lime) was also tasty.    We tried the pork shoulder tostadas (ginger aioli, kimchi, scallions), the house made charcuterie, and the beer cheese with stuff to dip it in.  The pork shoulder tostadas were good and I enjoyed the beer cheese but the charcuterie was just ok.  I would come back here, especially for happy hour right after work."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a favorite of my friends. When I come visit it's standard that we come here.   Service is good. Friendly outgoing staff.   They have a good brunch as well as all day food options. The outside patio is also nice to sit on with comfortable furniture out of the standard seat. They have little love seats or couches for guests to sit on.  They have good sized burgers, nice drink options and if you like it, foie gras that is great."}
{"text":"Last night a friend and I had our first pig and pickle experience and we were both very impressed from start to finish.  I love trying new places and new foods and they had that (ex bone marrow). Highlights were the pickled grapes, pork sausage with duck and the Elvis desert.  Our server went above and beyond to answer our questions and made the meal more enjoyable. I would highly recommend giving this place a try. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Dear Pig & Pickle,  I love you.   No really. I do. It was love at first bite. (Hardy har har.)  You convinced me to try blood sausage, head cheese, and kimchi. I'm not sure how I lived life before eating your duck fat fries, especially when accompanied by a variety of unique aioli sauces (garam masala?? Amazing!). You make your own apple butter, which is also delicious, of course. You're open super late?? How did you know I hate going to bed at a decent hour? You know me so well. Your cocktails are excellent too. Everything you do is wonderfully simple but not at all boring. Oh, and your patio is nice.  Let's never break up.  Love,   Sarah"}
{"text":"I am happy to say that I enjoyed my time in Scottsdale very much! Almost every restaurant we went to was AMAZING!!! It made me so happy.   My family and I came to Pig & Pickle on our last night there and I must say, we saved the best for last! This place is to die for. Bomb ass cocktails, appetizers, food, and over the top service.   Next time we're in the area, we'll eat here more than once. That's my goal :P"}
{"text":"I've been there twice. Once as just a regular patron. I found the food so good that we decided to have our office Xmas party here.  The second time was with 12 people in the private back room.  The meal was stupendous, the service fantastic and the evening couldn't have gone any better.  This is just a wonderful, unpretentious jewel in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple other times and i thought maybe we just went on a bad night.  We wanted to give it another try.  It was very disappointing!  Our waiter was awful! he came to out table a total of 3 times the whole hour we were there! My boyfriend ended up getting full on water because his portions of the food was so small.  I ordered the chicken which was good.  My boyfriend ordered the Duck entree that was $24.  I wouldn't mind the 24 dollars if  the portion size was good.  The plate consisted of 4 pieces of meat, 1/2 cup of potatoes and an even smaller portion of vegetables. When we left, we went across the street to Whataburger so he could get some food.  I would not recommend this place to anyone, the atmosphere was different than the time before, i just did not feel welcome there and the service showed it!"}
{"text":"Had the bone marrow tonight, first ever! So good!! Whiskey shot off the bone, made the whiskey taste so extra ordinary. I will definitely get it again! Thank you to my amazing bartender for suggesting it.   Love this place, I've started to come here on a weekly basis for the atmosphere and great people. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been meaning to try this place for about a year. This past July, we were at the Real, Wild and Woody beer fest in Tempe and P&P was there giving out free tots and we were impressed. We told the chef (who was serving at the beer fest) that we had thought P&P was French food, to which he responded \"we are fat kid food\". We were sold but didn't actually make it to the restaurant until my husband's birthday in January.  We enjoyed every part of our meal. We had two tots of the day (Sriracha something?) - do not skip out on tots! We also had some sort of mini assortment of pickled items (so good, next time the larger assortment). The broccoli beer cheese soup was to die for (wished we hadn't shared). I had the veal that was a chefs feature that night and my hubby had the pork shank, both were executed perfectly.   My husband enjoyed their large assortment of craft beer and I loved the Funktional Drunk (one of their many craft cocktails).  The service and ambiance was on par with the rest of our experience and our chef friend from the beer fest sent the strawberry vinegar pie our way and it was the perfect finish to the meal.  We were so impressed we made Valentines reservations before leaving the restaurant.  Can't wait to try their brunch as well!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. We stopped by on our way to Scottsdale Stadium and were pleasantly surprise. Wife got the BLT and I got the smoke potroast. Both great.  Quick and easy. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Once again P&P has satisfied my hungry growling belly.  The place was packed at 630 on a Saturday, only one empty table and we got it, phew! Since, we've been here a few times, I already knew I was having the pork tostadas, even though I've been wanting to try the bone marrow, I just couldn't shy away from what I know is a hit. I also had the chowda with a side of pork belly, wow! Hit the spot. The hubby enjoyed his HUGE Cuban sandwich with the dump truck salad. The delicious mustard sauce with the sweet pickles really stood out with the meat and cheeses. Mm.   Now for dessert, we saw a lot of people ordering the s'mores pie, but we've talked to the man who makes the bread pudding creations and you got to try the new flavor he puts out each time. This was a cinnamon raisin with caramel sauce and homemade ice cream, and that bowl was empty quick.   Everything was on point except getting our check but I'm in the industry and our waiter was busy, and I'm not deducting for someone who is hustling to take care of his guest. Keep up the good work P&P, it looks like you will be around for the long haul, and that makes my belly happy."}
{"text":"The good: excellent house made charcuterie appetizer,  best lox I have ever eaten. Every offering was fantastic. The platter was enough for 3-4 people. My Shrimp and Grits was fabulous with the lightest grits and a touch of spicy sausage. My son's Ciopinno  was delicious. The vinegar pie sounded odd for desert  but was very good, served with strawberry compote and fresh whipped cream. The bad : very poor service.  In all fairness,  it was a very busy Friday night,  but, still, not acceptable. Our waiter spent a good amount of time socializing with the chefs at the open kitchen instead of tending to business. Go on an off night or off hours...by 8pm the place was not so crowded."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch brunch and dinner. Excellent casual atmosphere with a full bar and an interesting eclectic menu with all homemade goodies. Friendly helpful outgoing staff. Definitely recommend to try and check it out. Plus a nice selection of draft and bottled beers and wine. Plus they have a daily happy hour and a late-night menu. Leaving for stars are by"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh...the late night menu was some of the best food of my life. The tacos are amazing, I would kill for them! The vinegar pie is excellent, such a bright clear strawberry taste. I love that the menu changes daily, its a great way to try new things at a place where you know you'll get phenomenal service. I can't wait to go back and try out some of the cocktails!"}
{"text":"One of my most notable New Year's resolutions is to become a local at Pig & Pickle. Given the unassuming location at Hayden & Thomas, you wouldn't expect much from a restaurant in those parts. Yet it's a hop, skip and a jump from our house and it doesn't involve going into Old Town. I couldn't be more delighted with how much this place actually rocks as a humble yet trendy gastropub with fantastic eats and tasty booze. There is more resemblance to a neighborhood, pacific northwest eatery here than your typical Scottsdale overpriced, politely mediocre restaurant - which is precisely the appeal. As such, I will be returning on my cruiser for happy hour as often as I can.  As a pescatarian, I wouldn't have though there would be many options on the menu at a pork joint, but alas P&P delivers! With plenty of satisfying veg and seafood choices, I have yet to meet something here that isn't delicious. On a dreary winter night, the squash soup and tots were just the ticket to warming up my frozen bones. The brussel sprouts are also to die for and could convert any cruciferous hater out there with that runny yolk pouring all over the golden and crispy deliciousness. I can't wait to try the shrimp and grits next time. It seems there is quite a rotation to the menu as well, which always keeps things interesting.  The cocktail and beer menus are just as impressive and satisfying as the food. While the Amish Mule was just a tad sweet for my liking, it was a refreshing pick. The Vesper knocked me on my bum for a while, so needless to say it was damn good. The bartenders are super friendly and laid back - I'll be hard pressed to sit at an actual table any time in the future. Plus, if I am to obtain my goal of becoming a local, a seat at the bar is essential. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick dinner on a Thursday night. The place wasn't busy at first, however it took a little while before I was greeted. My waiter was really nice though. He made an excellent recommendation on the cheddar soup which I would recommend too. Simply delicious. It's topped with fried calamari, nice idea instead of the regular calamari app. I actually went there because I was craving for pork belly, and here's why I don't give 5 stars: it wasn't bad, but too salty and tough (difficult to chew). In a place called \"Pig N Pickle\", you expect the pork belly to be the ace in the hole...in other words, the most delectable of all the dishes. Sorry, I had better pork belly before. I'll go back again of course, just not for the pork belly."}
{"text":"Again, this place blows me away. Every time we come here they amaze us all over again. Amazing cocktails paired with great bites. Every server we've had is attentive yet laid back. Every dish is well thought out and just magic to the palate. Lovely dinner to then finish with their strawberry vinegar poor, just divine! We always have a great time and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a little neighborhood gem. I'd heard great things about P&P so I was dying to it. Chip was our server and really kinda made our visit more enjoyable. He is extremely knowledgeable about this menu and he truly likes his job and it shows. His suggestions were spot on. We tried the pickles \"things\" which had beets,eggs, kimchi, cauliflower,pickles and carrots. Their take on tater tots is awesome, too. It changes daily, too. Ours had pepperoni and mozzarella inside and served with a spicy aioli. I had the pork shoulder tostada and my only complaint would be the ginger aioli, plus ginger in the kimchi and my Moscow mule on top of it was a bit of ginger overload but that was my fault for not realizing how much ginger stuff I had actually ordered. My friend ordered the Croque Madame with a duck egg. It wasn't the best I've had but quite delicious nonetheless. The owner stopped by and said Hi which was so cool. I've been in this biz a long time and it's the little things like that that will make this place a success. Cheers P&P....see ya soon!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed a great brunch on Sunday. This place is warm and friendly with great service, great food and great prices especially for the amount of food that is served. I had the farmers scramble which was very large and delicious. It came with an everything bagel, creamy scrambled eggs, lots of large wild mushrooms, tomato, kale & cheese. I usually never like scrambled eggs but this were exceptional. I also had a side of bacon which also was large and so good, delicious perfectly cooked crispy but not over-cooked bacon; just like it should be.  My husband had the fried Brussel sprouts with a side of pork belly and he loved it. It was so large and filling he brought some home for later that day. I tried some of his pork belly and again it was perfectly cooked and delicious. They have a great selection of craft beers. I had a vanilla stout and my husband a tripel ale both very good. Before leaving we stopped in their new provisions shop which has an array of take home items from cheeses, steaks, homemade sausages and smoked meats. We took home a pork asiago sausage and an andouille sausage and both were so tasty and had the with the right amount of herbs and spices we wished we had purchased more than having one each, We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Overall tasty, well made food. I have to say that a must try is the 'tots'. Not your usual variety: made fresh of a ball of fried mashed potatoes...very tasty! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So, Pig & Pickle is pretty good. Stopped in for dinner one night with friends. We got there between 7 and 8 on a Saturday night. We were able to get a table for 4 without a wait. The air in the restaurant was a bit stuffy and warm, but it was nicely decorated.  I asked for a diet Coke but was told they only have Coke Light, which is a lower calorie version of Coke. There's 111 calories in the bottle. The server told me they don't have diet Coke because they try to have more healthy menu items. Fair enough - aspartame isn't great, but some of the menu items are so decadent and heavy with butter, etc. that I found his comment about the diet Coke a little amusing.  I had the shrimp and grits. It was good, but I didn't think the seasoning was anything extraordinary. I also thought the portion was a bit small given the price. My husband had the Monte Cristo, which he thought was pretty good; it didn't wow him, and it was extremely heavy. My friends had the pot roast sandwich, which was good, and the duck, which they said was amazing. The accompanying salad for the sandwich had a dressing which was kind of oily and lacking flavor.  Service was good; our drinks were never empty and our waiter was able to make some good recommendations on the menu. I think some of the entrees were OK, and one was wow. The prices were a little high for some dishes, and reasonable for others. Overall, I think 3 stars is appropriate. I guess I just don't get the hype, but I wouldn't mind stopping in again. The fact that the menu rotates on a frequent basis is enough to make me come in for a different meal and give it another try, because I think the restaurant is promising."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! ! Homemade pork grinds were goood. Shrimp and grits with pork belly...I wanted to cry so good. And the drink he brought me Keep Yer Pimm Hand Strong was More!!! I wanted more."}
{"text":"I've now been to Pig and Pickle on a few occasions. I've extremely enjoyed each and every experience. Although I don't eat pork,  they provide many other options...even for vegans and vegetarians. The food is amazing, drinks are killer and everyone is VERY friendly! I love their style and I will continue to go.  Thank you for bringing such a cool spot to south Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. First let me say the service was spectacular. Our waiter was prompt to greet us and get our drinks as well as food order. He gave great descriptions of the menu items and was very attentive. The food was good and to my surprise somewhat gourmet, considering the name of the place. Don't  be afraid all the food may be or contain pork; they have other options such as chicken, salmon or vegan plates. A place worth trying!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot and much different than what I expected.  It has the laid back vibe of a BBQ joint, but with a dash of class. :)  It was my first time there and unfortunately I had already eaten dinner.    Although I had already eaten I was not too shy to pick off of a friends plate. He had some sort of pork shank with mashed potatoes and kale, the kale was amazeballs!!!  I tried a bite of the snapper and just before I say something, I don't really care for fish.  The snapper wasn't fishy and had a lot of great flavor.  For those who don't typically eat fish let me warn you....it still had a head....like, with eyes and lips. :-o (similar to that.)  The bartender just so happened to also be....one of the owners. :)  He was very knowledgeable when it came to wine, mixing drinks, whiskey, bourbon...truthfully, I think he just knows his alcohol.  He was really friendly and chatty, but not too chatty. ;)  He made my friends a few mixed drinks recommended by him, they loved them all.  I stuck with the wine because I know I enjoy that stuff every time.   Overall, it was a great experience it's too close to my house to not go back for a nice happy hour.  I recommend if you haven't been to at least try it out for some drinks and munchies."}
{"text":"Hands down the best food and drinks in Scottsdale. Everything we ordered was stellar.   We ordered six different appetizers and six different dinners. Passed everything around the table.   Drinks were really fun, different and delicious.   Our server was excellent. Fun, engaging and gave great service."}
{"text":"Our 2nd visit at the pig and pickle. Another great meal! We will be back a little more often now. We have to try their Sunday brunch with three dollar mimosas! Food here is always perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and silky smooth.  Jen is a great and friendly server with knowledge of the full menu. She def adds to the culinary experience!"}
{"text":"Delicious does not even begin to describe the delights that await you at Pig & Pickle. Great service, hip vibe, and YUM food. Pig delivers the Pig!! We enjoyed the charcuterie, the bone marrow, the pork tacos, the duck-fat fries, and the lovely libations. To say that we'll be back is an understatement. We'll be back about a hundred times every time we're cravin' bacon!!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I stopped in to Pig and Pickle for a late night supper last week and I have to say I really like the place. The atmosphere was very casual and relaxed but it seemed like at the same time there was an attention to detail and the staff really cared about the food and took pride in their restaurant. Our waitress was very sweet. I ordered the beet salad but I wanted it without the bleu cheese crema and so she talked to the chef and had them make a different dressing for it so that it wouldn't be too boring and still have plenty of flavor. It ended up being a really delicious salad and the beets were fantastic! The hubby ordered a burger which he was equally pleased with. It looks like they have a good beer and wine selection at very reasonable prices so I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Updated: Thanks, Clayton, for your response. Honestly, I forgot what part of the pig it was (turns out, it was pork shoulder). It was more greasy mayo than pig, so I got confused. Your bartender gave me a half hearted \"sorry\" on the way out, so I'm good.  The first time we came here, we had a good experience. The second time, not so much. They switched to the late night menu early, so we had limited choices on food. Had the pork belly tostadas, which were previously good. Tonight, they were seriously gross and heavy on the mayo. Could only eat a few bites before feeling sick. Drinks were terrible too. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"By far our favorite spot on every occasion! Brunch, dinner, late night, or even just cocktails are always on point. Not to mention the staff and atmosphere are always welcoming. Both owners are always there and make a point to talk to their guests. Being in the industry I honestly can't say enough good things about this place. A absolute MUST try! Promise you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"Oh, yum! Every meal should be like this one.  We started with the wood oven roasted marrow and braised pork belly. Both were great, but I had a hard time not sucking on the bone, because I was just that good. For the main course, I chose the pork flatiron, which was good. But compared to the braised duck, it wasn't spectacular. Nonetheless a very good cut of meat.  The most conflicting part of our dinner was the dessert: sear carrot cake. The cake was moist and delicious. The goat cheese glaze had the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. The carrot chips were perfectly crispy. The peppered caramel sauce, sweet and peppery. But together...we weren't in love. But it took the three of us tasting and thinking, critiquing and tasting again to figure that out.  Overall, a great meal."}
{"text":"Pig & Pickle is an upscale eatery in South Scottsdale - the type where you can see the kitchen and the chefs doing their thing while wearing crisp chef uniforms - the type of place where you can't have things the way you want. The dishes come how they are listed on the menu. No onions? Sorry, this isn't burger king - you can't have it your way. This is the sort of joint where the food is almost art and they don't want diners second guessing the expertise of the artists in the kitchen.  I find this sort of thing to be a bit pretentious, but at the same time I do appreciate going to places like this - as a treat. The menu is filled with really unique dishes and it's definitely aspiring above the neighborhood. It'll be interesting to see if they last in this spot. I sincerely hope they do. It can only bring up the game of the area.   My gf and I tried each other's dishes and we definitely had a wide sampling of desserts and entrees. We were about 50/50 on the dishes. We liked the sandwich and the bread and thought the desserts were fantastic, but felt a few of the dishes and items to be lacking. It was a mixed bag really, but as we were told - they are really new and still experimenting and finding their stride.  If they lower their self-importance level a bit and offer up a little more variety, they will make more friends. So far though, it looks like they don't need too much help. The server told us they have been really busy since they opened. Speaking of which - service was a bit slow and spotty, but he was super nice, professional and went out of his way for us.   I'm giving 3 stars because I liked it, but I see room for improvement. I will definitely be back, and I plan to bump this up to 4 if they iron out the kinks. They probably deserve a 4, but I feel like at these prices and presentation - things should be a little tighter... expectations are a bit higher."}
{"text":"Jake! Jake! Jake! Best server! Of course familiar with the menu, have great suggestions and the food was Delish! Cool atmosphere, great music! We'll definitely go back"}
{"text":"The pork shoulder tostadas were delicious! The servers were very nice but forgot to bring a few things we had asked for. I was almost done with my meal by the time he came back to even bother asking again. Oh well!!! Everyone seemed to think their dinner was just ok.  Drinks sound amazing but were kinda bland.  To the end the night my seat outside was covered in ants!!!!"}
{"text":"Friggin fantastic late night spot. Great variety on the menu, with good drinks to go with. Service was top notch and very friendly. This area really needed a place like this. Can't wait to go back. My only suggestion, try to keep at least some of that Nutella ice cream around for the late night eats. I need something sweet after eating such great food!"}
{"text":"It was like a southern / American restaurant, we were greeted once we walked in and seated. I wasn't sure what to expect since we just wanted something on the way back from Glendale. I had ordered the clams and mussel entrée and added a side of pork belly. Plating was 5/5, service was 4.5/5, cleanliness was 5/5, quality 5/5.  I have nothing to complain about, Nate our server was really nice and he gave us great reccomendations. He also gave us a free pie for my sisters 19th birthday. We also tried the lavender creme brûlée which it wasn't too sweet so it was just right.    Not sure if it's a restaurant I would drive out of my way for but its a good place if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Service, cuisine, and atmosphere are unparalleled. Try to find find all 3 elsewhere. I dare you."}
{"text":"I really should not be reviewing this restaurant because I shouldn't have come to this restaurant.  Ha ha.  I don't eat any pork, and the whole restaurant smells like ham or bacon.    I came here after happy hour at another restaurant with a friend.  He wanted to eat dinner and he loves pork (and pickles) so he chose this place.    Their cocktail list is pretty fabulous and has some funny names (The Dirty Sanchez was one of their cocktails.  Can you imagine someone ordering that?).    I ordered dessert, which was a Mississippi Mud Cake and The Maggie (a mixed drink).  The two did not complement one another, but the cake was FABULOUS.  I wonder who makes it for them?!  Is it made in house?  I must know these things.  My drink was also phenomenal, but not very strong.    I really liked the setup of the restaurant with the open kitchen.  I also liked the large piece of art of a skateboarder that was on the wall (but at $2K, it was not in my budget.  Plus, I don't have a wall to accommodate it.).    If I ate pork, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food is super salty. I had the Sow burger and it was good but like stated salty. If you get the fries, ask for no salt."}
{"text":"I had decided that I was not giving in to the \"Pig-themed\" restaurants.  I mean \"Pig\", \"Pork\" and \"Swine\" restaurants are popping up everywhere!  But I noticed that, no matter how hard I tried to ignore P&P, it would pop-up on all of the foodie sites that I check around Phoenix.  So, for several months, I scoped this place out... checked out this restaurant online and with daily drive-bys in my daily commute.  I finally decided 2 months ago that I needed to check out P&P.  I was sold, food-whipped on my first visit and I've been every week since.  They source all their veggies locally.  They make as much as they can in house from the meats on the chacuterie tray to the pickled veggie/items that appear on every dish.  They even bake their own bread!  I fell in love y'all, with a Pig & Pickle.  This restaurant is in a nondescript strip of shops.  I could not tell you what stores exist adjacent to P&P.  It is off the well \"beaten Scottsdale Rd\" path, and yet, the food is exciting, relevant and has a depth of flavors that is unbelievable.  I'm a fan of P&P and once you give it a try, I think you will be too.  I have tried a few things on the menu, let me start with the crafted cocktails - pricey, but still yummy and worth every penny.  They carry premium spirits and they make just about everything that goes in those crafted drinks from scratch.  If you don't want to spend $12 per cocktail, they have a wonderful HH menu with $5 cocktails from 4-6pm. Satly Dog: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=aG_8tn9ZxqvTDDwRB-tfhA#wshXHwfqyLloLxHV7g86eQ    The star of P&P is the food.  I have tried several things on the menu and I'm happy to say that not one thing was even remotely disappointing.  Everything that I've been served there was 4 Stars and above.  My favorite item thus far was on the new brunch menu.  P&P started serving brunch this past Sunday.  After church, I stopped in and ordered the Bloody Sconnie and the Bacon, Andouille Sausage and Aisago Cheese Fratta.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=f-ez6J4BhI4U2Gk_Brvr7Q&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA  An extremely delicious dish that is really more like a crustless quiche.  This dish has a serious (and I mean SERIOUS) kick to it.  It is not for the people who can't handle spicy food.  This dish was excitingly delicious.    My 2nd favorite was the braised pork belly http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=od8GMSNVUu4fAT3H1IoqcA&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA   The braised pork belly sat atop a delicious mound of mashed turnip bottoms.  The pork belly provided the right amount of saltiness that was balanced just right by the sweetness of the apple butter.  The arugula top the creation was just the right amount of earthiness to pair with the turnip bottoms.  I love all the flavors.  But as I told my mom, it was almost like eating a southern meal that contained ALL these ingredients, but prepared somewhat differently!      During Happy Hour, they offer a chacuterie plate http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=n62C4gnnQkajkiORQ-tpaw&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA that is HUGE for the $5 that they charge!  In this pic, the chacuterie included bacon butter to spread on my homemade pretezel bread.  YUMMY... YUM is all I can say!    To top it off, they have the nicest guys working behind the bar.  I mean... honestly, part of what makes my day when I go into a place like this are cute guys who can mix a drink and order up some food for me to eat.  Clayton and Scott are awesomely attentive and I just love sitting at their bar!    My to try list (because I trust everything on their menu): Shrimp and Grits Braised Duck Leg Croque Madame Salmon Tot - 6/30/2013 - 4star.  Pork Shoulder Tostadas  Each 3rd Monday of the Month, join them for Beer Dinner 6:30pm.  I'm hopeful they will have other events in the future.  I think their crafted cocktails would be a great thing to center an event around.  Oh gosh, they have free wi-fi too!  This is a gem in Scottsdale/Old Town.  Eat, Pig out and Enjoy!"}
