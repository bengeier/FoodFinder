{"text":"Our waitress was so very nice and understanding BUT our Fish meals were not good at all today and the fries were like they had been microwaved. There are times when food can be bad everywhere. Worst complaint was the Manager/owner? She was so, so rude like our business didn't matter. Very unprofessional, no respect and even though we were not charged for our food (paid for our drinks) she dropped our bill trays on the table from a high level...might as well slammed them down.   Shame on her! We come in to visit family and have went there  at least a dozen times and have never experienced anything like this! Time to find a new place for Family dinner."}
{"text":"People are always judging me. If I go to the bathroom the guy in the next stall is judging me. If I go to Parma and blast my Chevrolet through the pot holes people want to tell me I'm a loser. What's wrong with Parma? Really? There's a lot of lovely things there. Local politicians and officers of the law do their thing with aplomb. Sweet, intelligent, beautiful women with kind hearts and generous bosoms offer me, you, all of us their love, affection and baby-making skill. They are not afraid to say that they love me. Isn't that what life is about?  The Parma Tavern is yucky. I drank beer there and was awkward and then I ordered chicken fingers or tenders or strips or whatever it was called and they got the out of the bag into the fryer treatment. I spat one on the table reflexively to examine it and it was non-descript. The beer is not fizzy. The mixed drinks are not finished with a whisper like at the Velvet Tango Room. The ginger ale is sour. The restrooms beg for an errant spray (wolf-like and in late-night territorial angst) and the food is not wholesome or toothsome or even bloody and worrisome.  You don't have to go here because there are better places to go."}
{"text":"I thought the service stunk. Waited a good 10 minutes after being seated before being approached by our server.  Food was not so hot either... literally. I ordered a side of fries and there were a few hot ones mixed with some ice cold ones and some were soggy ,some crispy. They gave me like a bucket full- a huge portion of fries. I would have been happy with a small plate of fresh hot fries, not the ones that were ready for the trash bin, plus a normal order amount. My friend liked his sandwich I didn't try it.  Service was slow, not efficient and the food kinda sucked for me. We drank beer and those were good, but how can u mess up a bottle of beer? Atmosphere was extremely loud and obnoxious with a DJ talking the whole time like he's Bob Barker doing  the price is right. I couldn't hear my companion speak nor hear my server nor could anyone hear me because everyone else in the room was loudly talking because they're drinking and can't hear their friends speak or themselves think. I'll not be returning."}
{"text":"Honestly, the only reason this place is getting ANY stars is because the bartenders are super nice and quick to serve you drinks. I have no complaints about the service we received from our bartender, Tina. She was awesome!  But, we sat by the window looking into the kitchen a few nights ago, and I honestly wanted to throw up. The workers were constantly walking by with food in their mouths, munching and crunching on everything back there. The grill looked like it hadn't been cleaned for a month, and I saw one of the servers actually pick off some pepperoni on someones pizza with her bare hands, then handed it to someone else to serve it. Another larger woman was digging her hands into the chip bucket and grabbing handfuls and eating them right there! I hope she washes her hands after using the bathroom! You'd think that a restaurant where patrons can see where their food is made would actually want to strictly enforce health codes, obviously not. I will NEVER eat here!"}
{"text":"Food not too great. Horrible service.  Think the owner needs to train their staff better.  At the very least, tell them to come around to the tables more often and ask your guests if they need anything.  We had a table of of 13 or 14 last night.  About 8 of us were drinking.  In 2 hours the waitress asked me only once what i wanted to drink.  Once!  I had to ask her for my second drink.  Was never asked again after that.  This was pretty much the same for everyone at the table.  They easily could have had 2 more drinks/beers sold a piece from the eight of us who were drinking but they never bothered to ask us if we wanted another.  Cant understand this if your income is based on tips.  Dont know if she was new or just not properly trained.  But the more we spend the more you make!  As far as the food goes.  Ordered the turkey wrap club with fries.  Got a chicken wrap instead that was all lettuce, very dry and with very little chicken in it.  Fresh cut fries were good."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to The Parma Tavern for the first time on 12/14/2017. Sat at bar, had great food and good beers all at a very fair prices. Met Katy and Nancy working behind the bar. Excellent service and very friendly. Looking forward to going there again."}
{"text":"The service was horrible the food was just as bad if not worse than the server.  The only thing good was the ice cold water."}
{"text":"Hit the Tavern this afternoon for the \"famous\" pierogis! Was not dissapointed...Wonderful food, a super waitstaff(being Tina), and a general good vibe/feeling hanging around the locals at the bar. Very impressed! Will definitely come back when I return to Cleveland...  Keith-Chicago"}
{"text":"A classic american tavern, Parma Tavern it nothing exceptional or gimmicky and that's precisely why I like it.  It has a pretty good beer selection (10 on draft and ~20 bottles) and the standard liquor choices. The food is classic american pub food with some eastern European favorites thrown in as a salute to Parma.   Nicer than a dive bar, not quite a fancy sit down restaurant, Parma Tavern fills that middle ground of friends going out for beverages and maybe a snack while watching sports on tv."}
{"text":"Been patronizing parma tavern for 5 years, eating here or taking out one to two times at least per week, every month. I ordered wings a week ago, they changed the sauce to a salty disgusting flavor. I called in and the manager on shift assured me that she was very sorry and that that was all the vendor had at the time, but that they would be getting better sauce soon. She said next batch was on them. All I had to do was call in and place an order to go. Which I did today. The server I talked to was very understanding and said it wouldn't be a problem to take care of it, so I placed the order. I get there and was verbally and aggressively assaulted by an older gentleman who I'm guessing is the manager or owner and he made a huge scene in front of everyone at the bar! The server was even embarrassed and tried to make up for it. I was completely taken back and embarrassed and then he made me pay for 1/2 of my order! After my experience today I will never ever eat here or take out here again. Very very unprofessional."}
{"text":"\"I just don't get it why the reviews aren't higher for this place\" is what I would have said, along with a 5 star rating, until the last 5 minutes of our dining experience. But I digress, first let me say that the chili and wings I ordered were great. 50 cent wings on Thursday nights, and they're just as good if not better then the wings you can find at your big chains like Quaker Steak. The outside looks deceivingly small, until you walk inside and the place goes back pretty far with plenty of seating, nice bar and a great front patio.   Unfortunately, they were out of any fall seasonal draft beers. No worries, I settled on the special of the month-22 ounce bud light draft for only $3.  Service started out great, actually it was good up till the very end. Waitress delivered our drinks in under 5 min, food took less than 20 min to arrive and she checked up on us during the meal. Now we arrive at the awkward moment- when clearing our plates she dropped the chili bowl in my lap. But hey accidents happen and that wouldn't have affected my rating except she didn't apologize! So awkward! She grumbled about the way we had stacked the plates for her (I used to waitress and I do this out of habit and courtesy), basically suggesting it was our fault. I smiled and told her not to worry about it- and still didn't get the \"sorry\" I was expecting, and would have had immediately uttered repeatedly myself if I had been her.   Too bad...."}
{"text":"Its decent for a bar.  The foods good and they have a lot of beer on tap.  Gets so crowded and the lot fills up that you have to park across the street."}
{"text":"The only reason I ever come to the Parma Tavern is because I work very close by. It comes in handy for work \"happy lunches\" with a group of co-workers. I won't lie; they do have very tasty pub grub. Their fries are fresh cut and spectacular. They also have a variety of polish and other eastern European traditional dishes like pierogies and sausage varietals. All in all, it isn't a bad joint to grab lunch and a beer. Their corned beef is also very good.   Just don't expect fine dining."}
{"text":"We asked the Parma Tavern for help with a viewing party for a TV event our son participated in. The owner and staff were very accomodating.  They dedicated several TVs and turned up the volume so our group of 100+ people could watch and hear. We had dinner before the show; the homemade pierogies are fantastic especially with kielbasa. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"There are SO many bars and taverns in Parma and I would put this at a middle of the road one. Kind of loud and several different types of patrons. Reasonable prices. Presents itself as a little sloppy inside."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day and had a very pleasant meal with my two sons. Reuben sandwich was piled high, beer was frosty cold, onion rings were tasty. Deli sandwich was a large portion, and the chicken wrap got a thumbs up. Funky decor,  obviously a party spot; friendly and prompt service, reasonably priced. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The bartender looks great but multi tasking isn't her specialty. Great personality but she's prolly put down more alcohol than I have since I've been sitting here. Maybe not let the bartenders drink while they work."}
{"text":"Food isn't that great and there are better places near by. The outside patio is nice but that's about it."}
{"text":"Maybe going on St. Patricks Day isn't the best idea but it happened anyway. They were very busy but a group had just left and we were able to get a table shortly after arriving.   Once seated, our waitress came over and brought us menus, came back took the drink orders, then again for the food orders. Although I did not order, the food didn't seem appealing in my opinion. Service was beyond slow, it took 15-20 minutes just to process our payment. I know it's busy and that is why I am not giving it 2 stars but nonetheless, payment does not take that long.   Prices are average with other small taverns. Not sure I would return here again..."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now. With each visit I hope for something better...and it doesn't happen. Each visit was a in the middle of the afternoon and it wasn't crowded by any means.   There was plenty of staff on hand but they opted to hangout by the front door and BS while our drinks sat there empty.   The food is decent, typical Parma bar food. The problem is that the food takes forever to come out. 36 minutes for a Burger, mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers. Really?  I live 2 minutes from there but can't justify going back.."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Large facility and during the summer the patio adds even more space. I like that because people aren't on top of you. They always have room. Plenty of TV's with anything relevant constantly streaming.   Food is so good!! Wings are elite but why stop there? They do a GREAT job with local favorites like pierogis and chicken paprikas.   The staff is down to earth, especially Robin and Tina. I love coming in on Mondays for Trivia and or for any Cleveland game.  Not that I care, because I am so rich and attractive, but the prices are really affordable compared to the trend in the region. It's no wonder I keep coming back and back again.   Love it & highly recommend it!   #Blessed"}
{"text":"The bartenders are drunk idiots. You only get attention if you're a guy. Their chicken & nachos were disgusting.  May be different now though, who knows.  I haven't been back in a while."}
{"text":"My friend and I both ordered the Mac n Cheese and within 2 hours we both were having signs of food poisoning. In order to warn the Parma Tavern we called to let them know we believe we received food poisoning from the current batch of mac n cheese to prevent any other customers from getting sick as well. The restaurant automatically dismissed our concerns and handled the situation with extreme attitude and rudeness. Will definitely never be returning"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go watch a game with a bunch of people or sit on the patio. However, if you`re a female at the bar, good luck getting good service! I have been frequently ignored by the bartenders when stopping in for a drink or to pick up take out. The food is average, good sized menu. The fries are inedible unless you get them done crispy, and the other option is generic chips. The pizza is pretty good, as are the wings.  Fun environment though, especially on trivia nights."}
{"text":"This is a great go-to place for some cheap food and drinks (and some Wednesday night bar trivia). I go here for the convenience of being right around the corner and because it's one of the better bars in Parma. However, many times they are out of the beer I ask for. In addition, the food is just OK. While it has a better than average bar menu, the quality of the food is poor. I have yet to order a burger that has been cooked correctly, or food that has not been burnt. Usually, I just stick to an appetizer (who can do spinach/artichoke dip wrong?) to make my experience better.   Overall, decent place to go if you're looking for a cheap place to go for a night out."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Run of the mill bar nachos. Beware of sitting in the booths in the back near the bathroom.  Had a table full of drunk white girls  screaming screeching and generally acting like, well, drunk white girls. Sitting by them their screeches echoed. No Bueno. Was there at 6pm Wednesday and the juke box as controlled by older guys and their 70s pop music. Fabulous."}
{"text":"Parama Tavern has a great atmosphere. I went to the restaurant for the first time to watch the Ohio State game. The bartender was very sweet and accommodating. The food was so tasty and a tall draft was only $3. Highly recommend Parma Tavern. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Parma Tavern every Monday night for Cleveland Awesome Trivia. Good bar food - meatball subs, pizza, chicken sandwiches, etc. Love our regular server - Jeannie rocks! Lots of TVs, patio, good time!"}
{"text":"Three or four times a year(usually during football season) I stop in. Great food specials, bands, trivia, shot, beer and drink specials for games, holidays and fights. It's a local treasure in Parma. I love the chili! The menu has seasonal specials and for spring and summer they have a patio. Inside is a little dark but \"Tavern\" is in the name. Big ups with 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Went there not too long ago with a friend. There's a reason they got 4 stars from me.   We sat at a table for 15 minutes before being acknowledged by a server that wasn't even ours to begin with, and she told me that our particular server called off that night..that alone would've made anyone want to leave, right? low and behold, she came by and offered exceptional service to us even though she had a party of 19 to attend to.   We got our drinks promptly, and we also had an appetizer comped. The food came out hot, and was very good. She came by repeatedly to check in on us, and we never went without.    My bill was close to $60 I left her a $25 tip for going above and beyond."}
{"text":"I find the Parma Tavern to be surprisingly pleasant.  Really, I think anything in Parma that is pleasant is usually SURPRISINGLY pleasant.  Back to the restaurant - the wait staff is always really friendly, and they have lots of comfort (unhealthy) food in nice-sized portions.  This is a great place for a work lunch or happy hour right after work - not sure I'd ever be really interested in coming here for a dinner or date though."}
{"text":"I have been living very close to the Parma Tavern for over two years and walk there all the time. The wings, pizza, and build your own burgers are top notch and not too pricey.   They have a pretty big selection of bottled beer numerous beers on tap, and not just your bud light and coors light and the prices are pretty fair for bar prices.   If you go on Friday for Saturday night be prepared for an EXTREMELY LOUD  BAND to the point where you can barely talk across the table. But in the summer the patio is awesome and it doesn't matter if there is a band or not.  Service used to be pretty awesome and still is at the bar most of the time. Service at tables is hit or miss depending who is working."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend. She ordered chicken tenders and fries. I ordered wings and an appetizer platter.  Every item I ordered was overcooked. Very difficult to bite into the wings, hard and crunchy. Onion rings snapped like a potato cheap revealing a hollow core. Onion completely disintegrated from overcooking. Ranch and marinara were watery. Just plain poor tasting food, low quality ingredients.   My girlfriend found a wing in her basket of fries. If this happened to a vegetarian or vegan, this would be a major issue. Sloppy kitchen. Aside from the rogue wing, fries were not bad.   The manager came over and was very aggressive toward me. I simply explained that these items were overcooked to the point where I couldn't eat them. He said he wasn't going to take them off my bill because they \"looked\" fine to him. I told him I would pay for the items I was able to eat. 85% of my food was still sitting on the plate. He then starts touching my food with his bare hands and even eats some! At one point he exclaims, \"Well what did you expect? You ordered all fried food!\"    He angrily snatches a basket of wings and the onion rings and says he'll take these off the bill.    I get my bill, he took off $1.10. I ask him what's going on, and he says that someone must have made a mistake and comes back a few minutes later with a total of $3.xx off.   I tell him I'm not happy with this, then I am informed that if I don't pay the bill in full that they are going to call the police and have me arrested. At no point was my behavior inappropriate. I don't even drink alcohol, I had a Coke.  I realize I'm dealing with unstable people, and resign to paying the bill and contacting management the next day.  I call up and speak with the general manager. He says he was told that the manager last night was very nice to me and acted professionally. I told him to watch the security camera footage, and he makes an excuse of saying of all the cameras they have, there are none where I was sitting... lame. He says, \"Well, what do you want me to do? I'm not going to give you a gift certificate for free food, because obviously you don't like our food anyway.\" Unbelievable.   This place needs a complete management and training overhaul.  Your kitchen screwed up and overcooked food to where it wasn't edible. It happens, it is part of the business. You just say, \"Sorry, we messed. Can we get you something else instead? No? Okay, we'll take it off your bill.\" Problem solved, it's really not complicated.   One positive note was the hostess. She was very pleasant and was the only staff member that I talked to that seemed to care. To whoever you are, Thank you, I appreciate your kindness."}
{"text":"Visited here a couple times since my review.   Wednesday nights they have a live trivia game from 8-9:30ish [winner gets free gift certificate].   The trivia is nice although they had cheesy music on during the breaks instead of the cavs game.   The bartenders are cute for being the fake-n-bake types, what else did you expect: it's Parma ! The prices are higher than I what I'd expect for their beer and the atmosphere is still a bit older for me, way too many cougars around."}
{"text":"I have finally found my go to place for pierogies. Perfect portion with perfectly cooked onion. Add kielbasa and you have yourself a meal."}
{"text":"I've come here for trivia a few times, but honestly theres much better trivia venues in Cleveland on a wednesday night. The food sucks, most of the time its been too salty or cold. My friend once had a brownie that was both frozen and burnt (wtf?). The one enjoyable item I've had is the french onion soup, but you really can't mess that one up. They seem to have a decent beer selection, but when we get there (more than) a few advertised selections are out. Considering all of the above, the service is pretty decent and I bet these girls have to put up with quite a bit."}
{"text":"They put a fifty dollar charge on your credit card if you open a tab ,and then charge your card for whatever you buy so if you open a tab with 50 dollars in your account your card will be declined when you try to buy your first drink."}
{"text":"If I could do no stars, I would.   Went there, sat down, didn't get served until we moved to another table. Time spent waiting on countless servers passing us by without offering any help was around 25 minutes. The food came overdone and around 20 minutes later. For wings really? It's not worth anyone's time."}
{"text":"The beers and food are priced right. There service is usually on spot and the patio is wonderful! Oh yeah, the onion rings kick ass!!"}
{"text":"Since writing my first review for this place, my BF, friends, and I have gotten serious about chasing those sweet, sweet Cleveland Awesome Trivia league points and we have become straight up regulars...so I definitely think a more detailed review is in order.   First - shout out to the BEST server in the world, Robin. She's awesome and we look forward to seeing her each week.  I think across our group, we have tried almost everything on the menu now, and there haven't been any complaints. The fattiest items (wings, cheeseburgers, cheese fries) are definitely the best. Slightly healthier options like grilled chicken wraps and salads are really good too.  I mostly drink kid beer like Michelob Ultra so I don't know whether they have a good beer selection or not, but it seems like our friends who are beer people always are able to find a fancy one they like.  I love that the Parma Tavern has multiple lottery machines. Keno is the most fun you can have in a bar when you're not single.  All in all, a super fun neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest I haven't been here in a year and I am guessing the only thing that has changed is their prices. Of which they don't have anything that special here.  Wings pretty much doubled in price within 2 years which I am sure makes them more profit off less people, but it has lost the business of I and 10 of my friends as if we are paying that much there are better tasting options. Before that I didn't expect anything special it was just a cheap bar to get food and a beer.  That said I still enjoyed the chicken nachos (no olives) when they ran deals on appetizers. Could call me cheap, but their food taste wise is only worth it when on such."}
{"text":"Parma Tavern is a decent bar and a good place to see a band. Their food is good, prices fair and service usually friendly.  It is usually rather crowded (which I guess says it's popular!). The parking lot is really crowded and is waaaay behind the bar, so it's always a good walk."}
{"text":"Went here for trivia Wednesday night. Upon entering, we were told me needed a reservation to even be there. Luckily the hostess was able to find us a table in order to play trivia. Trivia was great and put on by Awesome Trivia. There is a $7 minimum with 18% gratuity PER PERSON. Just some things we learned from our first time here that we hadn't heard before."}
{"text":"Forget the food. It's mediocre at best. The real reason guys go here is the voluptuous barmaids. Becky will make your eyeballs fall out."}
{"text":"Going to the Parma Tavern is like going on vacation.  Just sit on the patio and close your eyes from the strip mall view across the street...those moving cars sound just like ocean waves, right?  The bartenders are Hooters worthy and the grub is cheap and plentiful so you at can at least leave pretty happy.  Overall, the Parma Tavern is exactly like you would want/expect of a Tavern in Parma.  I had decent service, plenty of people watching and you know me, I can never get enough Affliction!!  (ahem)  Ok, so maybe it won't be a frequent hit up (hint: that last sentence was sarcastic), but hey..Parma Tavern you're not bad!  BTW, pretzel sticks and cheese for $4.50 were well worth it!!"}
{"text":"I love bar trivia, which is what brought me here. Hosted by the company, Awesome trivia, this place hosts General Trivia on Wednesdays from 8pm-10pm, then I think Movie Trivia on Mondays. Trivia is a big deal on Wednesday nights! I have to call in to make a reservation because this place gets packed! As such, the service can get a little behind at times but when you're having a blast playing trivia time goes by fast. They have a monthly beer (usually some domestic draft like Miller, Bud light or Coors light) where you can indulge in a 22 oz for $3! Every night is some kind of deal for food. On wednesdays, it's a $5 pizza (to specify it's a plain cheese pizza, every topping is like an extra dollar). Pizza preferences will differ for everyone, I myself really liked this pizza. The pizza to crust ratio was perfect, it was not greasy and the size is perhaps medium I would guess and was good for 2 people. This place has it's own parking lot, but the last 2-3 times I'd been there on a Wednesday trivia night, I had to park next door or across the street.   This place is on the upper echelon of divey. Bathrooms are clean."}
