{"text":"I have been here a few times.  I think the food is amazing.  The service is friendly with one caveat.  I really do not like establishments where the staff are gossiping with one another on the floor.  Keep it low, focus on the customer, save your personal lives for off the clock.  Again I will keep coming back to Cocina Lucero.  I highly recommend the place nonetheless."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in our neighborhood so we head here when we feel like Mexican and not take-out Burritos (recommend Burrito Bandidos!).  We love to sit on the patio and drink our Sidral Mundet (apple soda) and Sol beer and eat quality Mexican offerings. There are quite a few unique things on the menu - taquitos and tamalitos; we also like the chimichangas and empanadas. Haven't tried any of the major fish and meat entrees but I bet they'd be pretty good. We like the service - it's very laidback and homey."}
{"text":"On this very cold night, we decided to use our voucher to dine at this mexican place. Its been here for 6 yrs, but I've never once come across or noticed this place. Small place where seating capacity is no more than 50ppl. Not much of a Mexican feel though, no sombrero and Mexican heritage. Maybe they're fusion of some sort.  Started with some complimentary tortilla chips with salsa. Our voucher was the one app, two entree, one dessert for a set price.  App: Shrimp Ceviche $12 Marinated shrimp in lime juice, dressed with avocados, tomatoes, cucumber olives, cilantro & onions. - Didn't really need the olives. The plate was marinated with too much juices on the plate. The shrimp is alright. Good portion.  Main: Fajitas $18 & choice of chicken, beef, shrimps or veggies. Served with rice, beans, tortillas & topping. - Got the shrimp fajitas. Good portion. Didn't touch the beans.  Lobster Tacos $18 3 Corn tortillas filled with Guajillo lobster, bell peppers & onions, served with beans & toppings. - Good portion. Lobster meat were mainly claws. Kind of spicy dish. Didn't touch the beans.  Dessert: Got the Fried Vanilla Ice Cream. Not bad.  This place I'm not sure why its slow, but the food is alright. I'd probably try elsewhere just to compare the differences as this place didn't stand out for me."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Cocina Lucero during a recent business trip in Toronto.  Mexican food overall in Canada is definitely not as prominent as it is in the states, so I definitely had to try this place.  It was also located on Yonge street which is one of my favorite spots in Toronto.    Overall, I thought the food was really good.  I was one of three tables so the service was fine, of which I had read some complaints below.  I ordered my first Steam Whistle beer as this was the only beer they had on draft.  Not the import I was thinking of getting, but still good nonetheless.  For dinner I had a set of 4 tacos 2 pulled pork and 2 pulled chicken.  Each pair of tacos were delicious and each topped with an avocado.  The tacos also had the traditional pairing of cilantro and onion on the side and the salsa on the side was the perfect heat.    I saved enough room and was able to try their fried ice cream \"helado frito\" and it was tasty.  The outside was a bit soggy and not the strong texture I was anticipating.  I will try something else the next time I go.  Overall, a great experience and great food.  I will be back in the near future."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend a little while ago because we were both in the mood for Mexican food and it was a warm, sunny day and this restaurant had a patio. We were seated on the patio and the waiter promptly came back with a bowl of nachos and some salsa. The nachos had an unpleasant, somewhat bitter taste to them and the salsa was watery and bland. We to decided to split the tasting platter which included a chicken enchilada, beef burrito & choice of quesadilla or tamalito on the side. We went with the quesadilla. Our food took an unusually long time to arrive, I'd say at least a good half hour. Everything in the tasting platter was bland and soggy, you're better off going to Taco Bell than his place."}
{"text":"Cocina Locero seats about 30 inside and maybe 40 outside, but it was humid and warm so I picked an air-conditioned table near the bar/TV. Before the entree I was served a wooden basket full of thin nacho chips and some really nice sauce/salsa. I ordered La Burro, which is a large vegetarian burrito that comes with a side salad. The huge burrito had rice, black beans, corn, broccoli, carrots, guacamole, and I'm sure some other vegetables like onions and garlic. It was grilled and it was awesome. The side salad was perfect, a mix of greens topped with grated carrots. Service was great, the bathroom was cute and clean and the decor was festively Mexican. And if that's not appealing there's an omnipresent 50-inch tv showing the news (at pretty much every small cafe and pizzeria)."}
{"text":"I found myself craving fish tacos and after a long search I found out Cocina Lucero indeed had them on the menu.  So my friend and I walk to the restaurant.  We were promptly seated by a friendly waiter who brought us some chips and salsa to munch on while we waited... and waited... and waited.  The salsa was horrible but we kept eating because we were starving.  When the 3 tiny fish tacos came I was so underwhelmed.  Utterly flavorless fish and dried out coleslaw laying on a tortilla with a smattering of mediocre sides for $16?!  I wouldn't go if it was free."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in the area. And they have vegetarian options too. The service may be slow during busy times, which is understandable but they're good and attentive."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!  I can never even finish my entree, it's a good portion and very yummy.  A tad expensive for what you're getting, but compared to Hernando's Hideaway up the street, this is a much better option by far.    Could use a bit more drink selection but the margarita was quite good!"}
{"text":"Note: this review is from my only visit, in 2009... after that day, I decided to not come back, but hey... maybe things have changed. Food was just OK, but really overpriced; the refried beans were completely burned and had a smoky flavor that refried beans never have. The staff did their best trying to keep everything in order, while the owner was standing up in a corner, doing nothing to help. When we were leaving, after paying, this person from management approached us and asked us what we thought of the food, and I was totally honest, letting her know that the beans were burned, and her answer was (literally) : \"well, let's hope the next time you come, they are not burned\"... come on, what next time???"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place many times and have always wanted to try it.  Finally gave it a shot last week for dinner with a few friends.  The place was fairly quiet and barely occupied.  Like: The service was pretty great especially since our table was a bit loud from a good day outdoors.  Servers were smiling, friendly and fun.  I liked the outdoor seating with the tree lights at night.  Food was reasonably priced and portions were pretty good.  Dislike: Not a lot of bad comments to leave.  The pitcher of sangria wasn't really worth it and a couple of small upcharges for things like different (better) salsa for the free chips are the only things that come to mind.  I'm also always skeptical of places that aren't busy during dinnertime.  Given that it's located close to my house and I thought overall it was pretty good, I'd be happy to go back again when I was in the mood for some Mexican food."}
{"text":"When Cucina Lucero first opened up I was ecstatic to see a restaurant of it's kind in the neighborhood. I was hopeful this would break the curse of horrible restaurants down the Yonge Strip but after a few visits I'm regretful to admit they've disappeared into the melting pot of other struggling 2-3 star restaurants in the area.  Positives Their food has flavor and sings an authentic Mexican tune. SIDENOTE: Toronto lacks really good authentic Mexican food (Dos Amigos has plummeted...yuck)  Negative The portions are tiny for the price. I've ordered the shrimp or chicken fajitas on a few occasions (16.99-18.99) and enjoyed the taste but disappointed by the lack of garnish and shrimp. When you eat Mexican you expect to leave with a comfortably full belly (whether its the Americanized or Traditional) and not an empty pocked but Cucina Lucero has that affect on you.  If you're in the area, are at a lost of where to eat, not too hungry, eat here! You wont be disappointed by the flavour."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking forward to trying this Mexican restaurant and finally went last night. It was busy, but a nice couple at a table for 4 made room for us. We ordered a pitcher of red wine sangria and both of the ceviche starters( shrimp/fish) The sangria was dreadful. Sweet and had an odd foam on top(?) It tasted like fruit juice. The ceviches were great. Plenty of fish/shrimp, served on a mixed greens salad. I wish that we had stopped there. We then ordered mains, chicken mole and the stuffed pepper with fruit and nuts. The chicken was spongy. It must have been frozen and defrosted quickly, as it was totally without any flavor and watery, The mole sauce was ok, but not enough depth of flavors. The stuffed pepper was not bad,but the white sauce that it sat in, had an odd,undetectable flavor.  If I went back I would stick with the starters and order beer."}
{"text":"Great food in a homely Mexican setting. The tomato soup was amazingly delicious and their chicken dishes are great. Close to the intersection of College & Yonge, this is one of the few non-fast food Mexican restaurants in the Village area.  If you're searching for a non-commercial dining experience with homemade dishes, this is the place to come."}
{"text":"So my date and I went to this restaurant after I saw it on T.V. I was quite excited to have the chance to try it out. It looks quite festive! Now lets get down to the food! I order the chicken enchiladas and let me tell you! It was delicious and full of flavour in every bite. The right amount of spice although a little part of me wish there was more spice as I love spicy food! My date enjoyed his dinner quite a bit however the name of his dish escapes me! But I took a bite and the sauce was quite good and flavourful as well! The waiter was very nice and we receive good service! Even a mini Spanish lesson when it came to saying pork in Spanish. My only complaint for this place is that there was a fly constantly flying around our food. Near the end it got a little annoying but other then that I enjoyed my experience quite a bit!"}
{"text":"Nice patio on a sunny weekday evening ! Place was empty when we got here (mind you it was very early for dinner - 6'ish. We ordered frozen margarita's since they were only $5 and they were soooooo yummy....so nice we had a couple.   The chips and salsa were nice with our drinks, they should of replenished though.  The menu had many items that sounded amazing and very authentic ! Ordered fish tacos and chicken enchiladas and a side of guacamole. All was very nice but came to $63 before tip and seems a little overpriced for what we had, but all in all it was nice and even had a doggy bag for lunch the next day - Ha Ha  compared to the only other Mexican restaurant down the street - 1,000 times better. Fresh and very delicious !   Waiter was a little slow - we could have ordered more drinks.....but he was getting busy so - all good !   Will certainly return to try a couple other items that sounded amazing but would be an option for a cold winter day !"}
{"text":"I have yet to find a great mexican restaurant in TO.  I lived in LA for two yrs and I absolutely fell in love with Mexican food.....so I saw this place on tv and thought I would give it a try......not that great....I was hoping to have some carne asada tacos or tamales, I have been craving ever since I moved back to TO.....I tried the steak tacos and they were as tough as leather....on another outting I tried the chicken flautas and they were not bad....but not great....I would say this place is OK but overpriced for mexican food, and service sucks!....so my search continues......"}
{"text":"We just wanted a place to eat dinner tonight and it was between pub food or whatever else we felt like at the moment.  I've walked by here numerous times but mexican food is usually on the bottom of my list (thought the drinks are about the top of my list).  Great attentive service by the sole server.  We ordered:  1 frozen margarita 1 Michelada (beer + hot sauce + lime)  1 fish ceviche 1 Tasting Platter (Chicken enchilada, beef burrito & choice of quesadilla or tamalito on the side)  We were served a basket of complimentary tortilla chips and salsa.  This is my favourite item to eat at the start of the meal.  The chips are thin and delicious.  Not rough and thick like a Dorito chip.  Our drinks and mains came in great time.  I don't think I've ever had a bad margarita!  I wish I could have had 5 more.  The Michelada (I believe that's what it was called on the menu) was a great spicy, almost carbonated mix.  I can take spicy but it was the spicy that gets you in your throat!  Excellent!  All these would be SO great on a hot summer day.  The ceviche was presented nicely on a bed of romaine lettuce with tortillas.  I have had other south american ceviches but not mexican.  Seemed like it was the same salsa sauce that came with our initial basket of tortillas with added ingredients and avocados.  Still quite delicious.  The tasting platter was pleasing because we got to sample so many items on the menu.  Also came with a tortilla bowl of refried beans and cheese on top.  Delicious large chunks of beef in the burrito.  Perfect amount of stringy hot cheese on the enchilada.  My only thought is... why is mexican food always so expensive?  Entrees are average $17 and up.  And usually consists of a corn product, cheese, sauce and a bit of meat.  This place must be rammed during Pride!  It's the perfect place to wet your parched  whistle!"}
{"text":"Do NOT be fooled by the decor of the place, which seems like an authentic Mexican restaurant.  This place is truly awful.  To start with, the food does NOT taste Mexican at all.  The prices are sky high and the service was unacceptable.    My friend and I stopped there this past Saturday to check out the only Mexican restaurant in the immediate area, and we ordered the Fajitas and the Puebla Chicken.  Apparently the order was not put in simultaneously and the Fajitas arrived first, which was fine by me.  My friend starts eating the Fajitas when out of nowhere, the owner or manager of the restaurant shows up at our table and without apologizing, removes the dish away from my friend WHILE he's eating and tells us that there was a mistake in our order.  She tells us that we had ordered a Quesadilla and that it should be arriving soon.  When we tell her that we did indeed order the Fajitas, she insincerely apologizes and gives us back the dish.  All the while, my order for the Puebla Chicken had not arrived yet.  At no point in time did we see the owner again.  I thought her lack of tact showed what she really thought of her clientele and we felt completely insulted by her actions.  The Puebla Chicken was decent, but it's not Mexican at all.  The Fajitas were ok, but again.. they did not taste like real Mexican.  Trust me on this one--I've been all over Mexico and this restaurant's food is far from legit."}
{"text":"I was excited to find this mexican spot downtown, but was sadly disappointed.  This restaurant has such great potential -great location, outdoor patio, etc. I was excited to try my chimmichangas, which were reheated, soggy, and flavourless. The menu is a tad higher than other mexican restaurants, so I would expect quality here."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on Saturday, at the request of a friend who was craving some Mexican after the heat & frivolity of the Dyke March. In general I'm not a big fan of Mexican restaurants, mostly due to my lactose-intolerance. I find that the safest item on any given menu for me to order is the Chicken Fajita, so as per my usual I ordered Chicken Fajita. There really is much to complain or praise about it. The chicken was nicely cooked, and the sides were good. I do wish there was less rice and more lettuce as I prefer my fajitas to be less stodgy.   My friend had some salad and some enchiladas. It looked good, and quite plentiful. You will not go hungry dining at this establishment.  The menu was small, unlike some other places like Hernando's Hideaway, but what they do offer is quite delicious sounding and plentiful. I would feel comfortable bringing a vegetarian friend here, but not vegan as due to the over-abundance of cheese & sour cream."}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast. The food was good. The portions were generous. The atmosphere was friendly."}
{"text":"Went again this past Friday....had the Enchiladas and they were frikkin AWESOME. The frijoles were made different which was pretty big disappointment for me (hence 1 less star), but we still chowed down and spared NOTHING!! lol"}
{"text":"Although the food here was pretty good I was disppointed with a couple things:  1) Prices were a bit high for the food I felt 2) Service is unbearable slow. It took us literally an hour and a bit to get our food! They only had 1 waitress servicing the whole restaurant and while she was doing her best she was obviously stressed out and was forgetting things. At one point they were getting ready to turn over two tables and had two couples waiting at the door to be seated. They stood there for a good 15 minutes before they were seated at tables which were already vacant!! (the other couple left by this time).   Now through all of this, the atmosphere of the place is really homey and if we weren't in a rush, wouldn't have cared about the slow service. The food was tasty and well made but nothing over the top. If it was a bit cheaper I might have frequented this place but Cocina Lucero might just be a one time stay for me."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place that makes decent Enchiladas and is casual/ not too pricey.. saw Cocina Lucero walking past it and decided to try it with my friend.  Place was pretty empty at lunch hour on friday which didn't feel like a good sign but I was definitely glad I went in. The food was excellent. We ordered nachos and guacamole, beef enchilada and fish tacos - everything was mouth watering and declicious.  Service was slow and we had to go inside to find the waiter to get a drink refill (we were on the patio). However the food more than made up for it. If it wasn't for the poor service, I'd have given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is adorable.  It's small, yet not cramped.  It's decorated in a way that makes you feel like you're in Mexico, without being overly cheesy.  The lights were a bit dimmed for dinner too, so could be a somewhat romantic place to take a date.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  The food was tasty with perfect portion sizes and decent prices.  I just wish there were more dishes to choose from.  I would recommend this place, and certainly come back myself."}
{"text":"Deliciously honest food. No gimmicks just great ingredients. This is not Mexican fast food.  The place is roomy and it had a good ambiance to it. The lighting was warm the tables and the cutlery were well prepared. The music was well chosen and added to the great feel of the place.  If you want a burrito that's made great  come to this place."}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! It was an unusually warm and sunny 27*c this May 8th. Naturally, a Friday evening of premature summer weather beckoned for a patio and some dranks. We happen to stroll by this poppin Mexican joint with a large ground level patio. The major draw was the lively band playing tunes outside. The speakers amplified the music indoors as well, and it truly felt like a little getaway in the middle of the city (literally along Yonge St. for that matter).  The food was all very good and reasonably priced to boot. Complimentary chips and hot sauce were brought out alongside the menus. I enjoyed my Chimichangas with their flaky tortilla and was especially impressed by the Tacos Placeros with beef. The beef must have been done in a slow cooker, it was very tender and full of flavour.  I'll be back when they have the band playing (every 2nd Friday I believe)?"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately the food was as far removed from Mexican as the location. While being \"good\" food, there was none of the Mexican flavors or spices. The salsa had nice flavor but no heat, the hot sauce(?) had slight heat but no flavor- combined it was adequate."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday night with a friend and were disappointed! Firstly the place was completely empty! There was a festival in the neighbourhood and it was pretty early in the evening so I guess we should have known better!  The staff was pretty attentive and actually waited on us since we took a while to order which is why the second star!   As soon as we were seated we were bought nachos and salsa. While I commend the gesture they seemed store bought and not fresh at all. Can't complain much here as it was on the house, although a very bad first impression. Food wise though it was a completely different story. We both ordered the chicken enchiladas and both our orders came in with no spice in the chicken and the chilli pepper sauce too was more like tomato sauce. Very disappointing!   With the bill came to over $60 for 2 enchiladas and a drink each which I thought was overpriced! Probably will try finding another Mexican place for another time!"}
{"text":"I honestly enjoyed my chimichangas. Until I got to the bottom of my plate and found there a foot long hair.   I'm not going to lie to you, Marge, that kind of ruined my meal.   The staff tried to make up for it by offering me a free dessert, but can you blame me for not wanting to see what would be floating in the flan?   They dropped a dollar off my bill but that didn't quite make up for it."}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time in a while....feels like maybe new ownership.  The spicy cucumber margaritas were delicious as was the guacamole.  The fish tacos and enchiladas were ok too.  But what made this a single star review was the service.  I asked for water several times and each time was a \"yes, we will bring it right out\". Which never actually appeared.  I finally went inside and asked the bartender for water...and our waiter who was standing there said he was just bringing it out....I called him out because I noticed the 3 glasses of water on his tray was for the 3 top behind our table, not the 2 top which was us.  He just handed me the 2 glasses and I carried them out myself.  No apologies, no let me carry them out, nothing!  The whole time we were there we noticed a lack of enthusiasm in the people working there.  Such a shame for what could be an amazing dining experience.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.  My boyfriend is Mexican and it would've saved me A LOT of trouble learning how to cook Mexican food properly.  Unfortunately, the service was poor.  The first time I went, I went with a few of my friends (none of us spoke spanish) the waitress who served me was unable to speak english properly and therefore it took a really long time to get what we wanted across to her.  When I got my dish (it was a type of sampler) the food was mush, it was just...mush.  The second time I went was a few months later this time with my boyfriend.  So he spoke spanish ordered all this food, and STILL mush....  The flavour was coming out but...in the end...MUSH!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for chimmichangas (seriously, they are huge and delicious), and really an overall good place for some reasonably priced Mexican food, without the super \"tex-mex\" vibe.   The prices are decent, the service is decent, and they have margarita pitchers on the menu (can't go wrong). So while there are definitely better places out there, Cocina Lucero is definitely nothing to complain about.  My major pointer for this place is that if you're eating on the patio in the summer, don't leave your food unoccupied! (You're probably wondering where this is going...) because there are tiny (and adorable) sparrows just waiting to steal your complimentary chips and salsa and (attempt to) fly away with them. I've witnessed it on more than one occasion, and it is definitely entertaining, if it isn't your food that is being stolen. And if you're afraid of birds, maybe sit inside, because they will perch on your table and beg for scraps!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Great value and good ambiance. Fish tacos were awesome. Great Mexican beer. Our party thoroughly enjoyed it. Authentic food. The tacos reminded me of real tacos in DF that we used to have by the metro station. Separate bills was no issue and much appreciated."}
{"text":"Try out the Ceviche and the Tasting platter, both are super delicious.  Their Chimichanga was good, but with a little crispiness, more sour cream and guacamole, it would be totally amazing.  Service was friendly and good.  I would recommend this place, as it is a challenge finding good mexican cusine in Toronto."}
{"text":"We saw this place on tv and wanted to try it out. We weren't disappointed with the food, very enjoyable and tasty, but the service was poor. The waitress would have to had to try very hard to have paid less attention to our table. I think it took 4 askings and about 25 minutes to get our bill after first requesting. Had they been busier I imagine they might have been in more of a hurry to take our money."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a number of times and enjoyed it, but after my last experience I will not be returning. I ordered the vegetarian chimichanga, which looked delicious, but when I opened it up it was filled with frozen vegetables (they were warm, but they were clearly the kind you buy at the grocery store in a large plastic bag in the freezer section).  I pointed this out to the server, who denied that the vegetables had ever been frozen, and later I emailed the owner, who made the same denial. If they had at least admitted the mistake and apologized, I could consider going back, but the fact that they lied to me was unforgivable.  Is it possible that I was mistaken, and that the veggies were actually never frozen? It's possible, but what I'm 100% sure of is that they tasted revolting. I don't just mean they were disappointing, I mean eating them was actually unpleasant."}
