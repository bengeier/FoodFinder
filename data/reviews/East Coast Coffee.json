{"text":"Excellent Kona coffee. It's very hard to find Kona coffee that reminds me of my vacation in Hawaii. This place is spot on with the Kona coffee. Friendly owner and staff. The place is warm and inviting. I love coming here!"}

{"text":"A cute coffee shop in Houston, Pa. was definitely a pleasant surprise. The service was good -- not the fastest coffee I've ever gotten -- but my Hawaiian Caramel Salt Iced Latte was excellent. I also ordered a blondie, something my mom used to make for me as a treat, so I was really happy to see that on the menu. I was a little turned off when it came out of a box, but it was pretty comparable to my mom's blondies, so I can't complain.   The store was very clean and nicely decorated. A woman commented on the Labrador Granite countertops while I was there, which apparently means something. The shop had a very earthly feel about it. Four or five wooden high top tables made it a nice place to go and get some work done. Free Wifi -- something I feel like should be synonymous with \"coffeeshop.\" The highest ticket menu item is a penny shy of $8. There are paninis, sandwiches, salads, etc... so it's really affordable, though I can't attest to the quality of food today, I'll definitely be back.  Another big plus for me was the music selection: today's alternative rock with a few throwbacks. My favorite was a blues rock rendition of Kanye & Jamie Foxx's \"Gold Digger.\"    Honestly, I'm just trying to figure out how I'm the first person to review this place. There were good people, good vibes, and good coffee. This might be the best kept secret of Houston, Pa."}
