{"text":"Petite is a tiny bistro that just opened in late May. When I say tiny, I mean they only seat about 24..   I tried Petite for the first time about a week ago on a Fri night. After reading rave reivews, I really wanted to like it... however, I was a little disappointed by the overall experience. It was a very warm night last night and unfortunately we didn't get a table on the patio. Instead we got a table by the kitchen. The restaurant was packed full and very busy and they didn't have air conditioning. As a result, it was a little too warm for comfort, esp being by the open kitchen. I was actually feeling the heat from the kitchen The food itself was fairly decent. I really enjoyed the charcuterie. The duck pate and some of the other meat were very impressive... it was some of the best I've ever had, esp here in Calgary. The accompanying condiments and mustards were top notch as well. I'd definitely order the charcuterie again. For the main course, I had the halibut. It was cooked to perfection. The flavours were good and solid (although I wouldn't rank it as the most memorable halibut I've ever had, I would order it again). One of my dining companions had the pork tenderloin. I was impressed that it was melt-in-you-mouth tender... texture-wise, probably the most tender pork tenderloin I've ever had at a restaurant in Calgary. Again, the flavours were good and solid (but not WOW). I was happy with the wine selections our server recommended. They paired nicely with the food. The overall service was good, although spotty at times... There were only 2 guys on the floor last night and the whole place was packed.. I'm not sure if that's the norm or they were short staffed last night. It just seemed like these 2 guys were constantly in a rush trying to keep things under control... so they were \"forgetful\" sometimes because they were multi-tasking so much. We didn't try dessert last night (I really wanted to try the panna cotta as it looked really good) and opted to go elsewhere for gelato instead to cool off as the heat was getting to us.  Overall, I would go back to Petite.. but will wait till when the weather gets a bit cooler or if I could make sure I get a table on the patio."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner with friends at Petite this past weekend. As the name implies, the setting is small but very charming...we loved it. Service was friendly and knowledgeable....recommended a fantastic wine that everyone enjoyed.  My wife had the sea bass which she raved about.  I started with a fabulous beef tartare and then had a great sea scallops dish with chanterelles. Another great spot for Calgary...very popular so book ahead."}
{"text":"Adorable little restaurant (hence the name?)  Its a very tight space, and our table was near the kitchen. You can see everything that is going on as its an open concept. The downside to this is that during the meal, we could hear ALL conversation going on between front staff and kitchen. But none the less its beautiful food, using local product. I definately recommend reservations if you'd like to go on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Overall, the food was okay, but definitely not value for money. Two stars is officially described as \"Meh\" by Yelp, and that sums up our experience perfectly...  Run of the mill fine cuisine dishes, served with sweet glazed sauces straight from a stuffy 1980's restaurant. They're focusing like so many places these days on local ingredients, but at the expense of originality. There was nothing here that we couldn't make at home. The drink menu reads: beer, wine, \"highballs\".  - No mixologist here...  There are better spots in town to drop a lot of coin...on the plus side, there's tons of parking in a reserved lot on 15th avenue."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but for the cost it really isn't worth it. Other places around 17th Ave have equal to better food for much less.  The biggest issue I have with Petite is the service. For the second time I have been really disappointed. Again, for the cost I would think the server could at least pair a wine with our meal or recommend a dish (there were also no specials when I went this weekend, something about a new menu).   Our server (both times) has disappeared mid-meal leaving us with questions and often wanting/needing more drinks. Our apps would came out fairly quick but then we had to wait for what seemed like eternity for our mains. Normally not a big deal except for our drinks were often empty as our waiter paid little to no attention on filling them up... and we weren't drinking water. We had been ordering bottle after bottle of wine but he seemed to not care that a bottle of wine doesn't last that long when shared by 4 people.  Our $600+ bill would have been a lot more had our server taken the time to actually serve us. On a Friday night we gave up and headed elsewhere for better service and quicker access to drinks and what ended up being a much better time. I can say 100% after giving it a second chance that I will never go back.   In summery, the food is decent but you can get a lot more bang for your buck at other places along 17th ave."}
{"text":"the food was EXCELLENT. worth every penny. the only downside is they need to improve the venting as we ended smelling like food."}
{"text":"On the joyous occasion of my significant other's birthday, we had decided to make reservations at Petites in Calgary. This is supposedly a french cuisine restaurant that apparently had decent reviews so it was the woman of the hour's choice to head down and give it a good tasting.   We had made reservations for about 12 persons and we awkwardly seated at a mash of 2 person tables pushed together. Large groups is definitely not a speciality of this restaurant. To support that as well, they were insisting that our food choices be limited to a smaller menu that the chefs had apparently pre-prepared for. I found that a little disconcerting that they could not support their full menu just because we were a larger group. It kind of boggles the mind actually, I mean, what if everyone in the whole restaurant ordered something different? Does this mean they would have difficulties in keeping up? It did not really make sense to me. When comparing our limited menu to the full menu, there was not really much of a difference other than about 5-6 dishes that were eliminated, one being the roast canard that the birthday girl really wanted and with some near-begging, was allowed to order, like they were doing us a huge favour or something.  The meal began with complimentary foccocia bread and a balsamic vinegar and olive oil dip. We ordered the beef tartare to start and I had the Beef Tenderloin done at medium-rare. The food arrived promptly and the Tartare was fantastic. Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture since I was hungry. I do recommend the tartare though, it was an excellently prepared appetizer. Well proportioned and made with excellent spices, the aromas were delicious as we spread it over some lightly toasted bread.   The beef tenderloin was very well prepared. Succulent and juicy, so tender in my mouth that it felt as though it was nearly melting. It was rich with flavour and a great cut of meat. The potatoe puree ( also known as mash potatoes to us laymen) was a good side as was the vegetables. Presentation seemed a bit messy and not the most appetizing, most definitely not what you would expect from a classy french restaurant. It was like they just blobbed the mash potatoes on the plate and put the beef on top with a ravioli hat, smothered in gravy. The chef could use a little more creativity.   The plate of duck was even worse for presentation, however it did taste very good as I had a couple bites to taste. The arctic char that the other's ordered had a nicer presentation, however I didn't have a chance to taste it. From their feedback though, it was very well received.   Service was decent. We were served by two asian male servers who seemed well knowledgeable about the dishes that were being served. They were always around to make sure our water was full and made sure that any drink orders or whatever else we needed during the meal was available. Unfortunately, their lack of a french accent took away from the fantasy of french cuisine, however that is to be expected in Calgary.  The mandatory gratuity was added to our bill which is something that I have always despised. I am usually a 20% tipper when the service and food are excellent but when I am forced to pay gratuities I tend to pay down to the last penny. It is a disadvantage to the service staff in my opinion as I have a pretty high tolerance for poor service, after all, I have worked in the industry in the past.  Overall, I would recommend this place for a night out with a few friends or even a date, though not a regularly occurring night out. There is comparable food around Calgary for similar, if not less, prices."}
{"text":"Its like dining inside a midget.. totally cutsie!  There is room for about 30 people  I had a date night on a Sunday where they have a fixed menu..  2 starters  2 entrees  2 deserts  So as I am drunk right now... the $44 bottle of Melbac (which tasted like gasoline, don't order it) This review may not make any sense.   I was concerned as I am a bit of a glutton that I would not be full after the small starer ( 1 salad, 1 Veal Cheek)  But after the Veal entree (the dates was scallops) I was already full.. maybe of the gasoline tasting wine.   We ordered a Americano and Cappuccino with our deserts... which were the high light for this foody...  Sticky Toffee Bread pudding... and the worlds most creamy Creme Brullie.   Delicious   Pros:  Fixed menu  Small attentive service  Attractive Chef in open kitchen   Cons:  Zero ventilation... I couldn't see across the room and now I smell really bad.  The grossest bottle of Malbec   So in closing if you order the yucky Malbec, suck it back so quick, then your second glass wont be so bad.   Total Bill for two on fixed menu Sunday with bottle of wine and 2 coffees.  $140.00 before tip"}
{"text":"The old Petite was great. I loved the space (even though you smell a bit after), fantastic service, and amazing food. Cheese plate was delightful with all the little jams/sauces. Sablefish was divine! Wines are nice and paired with each dish. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality.   At the new Petite - they have a great deal on Sunday. We went and tried set menu. As  good as the old Petite.  It was fun to sit by the kitchen and sip some of their $30 bin end wines."}
{"text":"My husband and I received a $200 gift certificate to be used for the Sunday evening set menu. On the gift cert it said a different glass of wine would be served with each course. Our server seemed confused by the gift certificate. We ordered from the two options provided for each course and a glass of wine was brought with the first course only. I didn't say anything but when our 'bill' came they had charged us for a beer my husband ordered as well as the coffee with our desserts. I found this tacky seeing as they didn't serve the wine and it was hard to believe we went over the $200... As for the food, the first course was delicious, a perfect braised beef rib with green beans. Our expectations for the second course were high, but the steak served was not good at all. Fatty and chewy, the meat just seemed like a poor cut. The mushroom cannelloni hidden underneath the steak was salty and unexciting. Caesar salad was good. My sticky toffee pudding for dessert was good but they went overboard on the nutmeg. My husbands cheesecake was quite good.    We will not return to or recommend Petite sadly...for the price and tiny portions the quality was not there."}
