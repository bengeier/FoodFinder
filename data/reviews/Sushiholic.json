{"text":"This is the best sushi in AZ.. I call it sugar fish because it's the only sushi that can even come close to sugy on LA"}
{"text":"This place is PACKED for a reason. Dont believe those peddling vapid mush reviews due to inflated egos. Everything about this place is perfect for a family friendly sushi bar. I have uploaded several pics and still want to give my compliments to the staff for making my autistic nephews birthday sushi a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Waited almost 45 minutes for two basic sushi rolls. We ask for the check because we were going to leave and then they finally came to the table. When we were initially ordering the waitress said no if you don't order enough then you can always order more. Since we didn't get them until almost 8 p.m., too late to order anymore so we had to leave and go get a bite to eat down the road. Very disappointing. Too bad cause generally the sushi here is amazing!"}
{"text":"Came in today to try sushi holic. Food was great but REALLY BAD SERVICE. Waited on our waitress elisia..... no show not even to great, when she did show up bad attitude. Then a hostess saw us sitting there and took control and served us. Thank you vanessa for your outstanding service!! Your smile made it better :)"}
{"text":"Awesome new spot. We loved EVERYTHING! We tried the Spicy Crab, Tootsie Roll, and Coyotes Roll. Would recommend all of it. The service was also excellent and the interior of the restaurant itself is very nice--trendy, but still relaxing. Great atmosphere. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My son loves the Ramen!! I had the sushi combo - honestly they are really good, it's my first time to give 5-star to valley Japanese food. By the way, serve quickly too!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd give this neighborhood restaurant a try.  We wondered why their happy hour basically runs from 2pm to close, after eating there we now know. Sushi was average, service was terrible."}
{"text":"Our family and friends are delighted to have found this versatile and excellent addition to the local food scene.  Just opened last week, we have been twice already and gotten great service and food both times.  This hybrid sushi and Japanese \"kitchen food\" Izakaya-type place hits the right balance with very tasty sushi and a variety of trendy dishes as well as comfort Japanese food.  It is the kind of place you can hit regularly.  Servings are generous and prices are low for the area.  On the foodie side, it is refreshing to see fresh wasabi on a lot of the nigiri and really good noodles.  On both visits the albacore was particularly well balanced and we swung through a range of prepared raw and cooked dishes and found everything great.  The owner, Masa, is clearly going to lengths to meet the needs of the customers and may have found the balance needed to survive in this part of town:  a great place to take the kids early or after work, but which transitions to a place for couples and friends to meet later.   the owner has children and you can tell he has thought about how to make it work for kids. Masa says he is strict about about serving the fish within 24 hours, which seems validated by the fact that prices fall after 8 on many items.  We really hope Sushiholic becomes a long term neighborhood staple.  If it becomes successful, we would like to see him add more daring Japanese and fusion additions to the menu to give it the foodie edge for when we ditch the kids to come out late for great eats!"}
{"text":"I come in here frequently for the sushi and happy hour. It is only this week that I ventured into a new world and ordered the Champon. If you like seafood and ramen then this is life changing. I know it sounds like Yelp hyperbole, but it's seriously amazing. A wonderfully low key spicy broth with noodles, prawns, squid, other seafood and vegetables. It is definitely worth trying. And, with such a large serving, you can take some home!"}
{"text":"It's cheap and that reflects on the fish quality. The salmon was not buttery as it should be and the California rolls tasted too sweet to be enjoyed. I don't know if it's their krab or kewpie mayonnaise but the spicy mayo also had an odd sweet taste. Definitely would not recommend to anyone. I will not be going again."}
{"text":"The two girls at the hostess stand were extremely rude to us on our way out. She mocked us rudely to the other hostess and we left as they laughed after mocking us. Very disrespectful and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great sushi this weekend at Sushiholic! Owner Masa took his time to understand our tastes and created a fantastic sashimi plater along with a couple of yummy rolls. Carla was also great and had several recommendations for future visits. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in the valley.  Reasonably priced, great taste, impeccable service.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved everything we got! Had the jalapeño poppers, miso soup, 4 sushi rolls, and calamari legs. The jalapeño poppers were our favorite. Sepehr was a friendly waiter and gave us great suggestions on food. We'll be back for it all. Plus the fresh wasabi verse just the powder wasabi. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"It's great to have a new sushi place in the area that has that intimate feel. More importantly, the sushi is really fresh and prepared exceptionally. The staff was also very attentive and friendly - a great option for a weekday night. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is horrible. Every time my wife and I come here (at least 8 times) once we're seated it takes at least 10 minutes for anyone to attend to us. I'm not one to expect gloved service or anything like that but please don't act like we're wearing invisibility cloaks. They've got to step up the customer part of customer service."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool... the food is de-licious & the service is amazing.  My BFF & I finally tried out this place thanks to Johnjay since he rants about it all the time.  We love sushi & now love Susholic.  We'll definitely be visiting again.  For all of Johnhay's fans, you may just see him and his family there... they arrived shortly after we did.  Lovely family!"}
{"text":"The service is good and staff is friendly.  Food is tasty but something was missing however I would come back and try it again."}
{"text":"I hope the owner READS THIS and does something about it.  My fiancé and I went to have dinner, we were immediately sat at a table near the patio, it young host approached our table and asked if we would like some water, after we received our waters, she told us that our waiter should be right over......waited...waited...WAITED then 15 mins went by and the waitress finally showed up didn't say hi she looked rushed and noticed that we had water....blah.  We ordered and the same hostess (name is Vanessa) brought our food over she was very sweet and apologized....the waitress showed up AFTER WE ATE and asked if we wanted boxes. UM I WANTED A GREAT EXPERIENCE FROM OUR SERVER. Food was EXCELLENT, I might go back but I will ask not to be seated with whom we found out her name was, Elisia."}
{"text":"We came to Sushiholic per Yelp's recommendation that it is similar to our absolute favorite sushi place- Harumi. The reviews and pics were steller so we gave it a shot.   Our server was great, he made recommendations and was quick to check on us so we were excited for our food. We stuck with just sushi with some of the salmon sashimi. The rolls were very disappointing. I thought that while the quality was okay, it wasn't any better or worse than a conveyor belt sushi place.   The Salmon sashimi was the best part, thicker slices with great texture and flavor. We loved the happy hour prices but because the rolls were so small (and mostly rice) we had to order 2ce what we normally would so the price came out to be the same.   We ordered a second round since we were still hungry and that set of food (three rolls) took about 40 minutes. Our waiter came and told us one of the chefs had left in the middle of the shift which is why it was taking so long. We appreciated the info but it was still frustrating.   All in all, it was okay but there are many places I enjoy much more."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better sushi places I've found here in Phoenix, and you can't beat the everyday happy hour."}
{"text":"I was super impressed by Sushiholic and will definitely be back! Yay for a new neighborhood sushi joint. The prices are great as well- our meal was the same price as it was at Sushi Station down the street last week!"}
{"text":"Love this new place. Great food, price, service, & ambience!!! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food, the atmosphere and the drinks were amazing. Samantha my server was so attentive and really made the whole experience! Being from Seattle I take my sushi and seafood very seriously and they did not disappoint!! Definitely worth coming in!"}
{"text":"1st  ever trying sushi was about 5 months ago and it was awesome! the staff is very helpful and friendly. I decided to come here again and it didn't disappoint. Love the enviorment and the food is delish!"}
{"text":"So yummy and delicious here!! Came in after a late night ball game and enjoyed the happy very much. We come from California, this will definitely be on our return to eat list."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Especially for the happy hour prices. Happy hour everyday until 7pm. Spicy tuna roll was actually spicy and no mayo in it-which is good. Very kid-friendly. We'll check it out again. Nice to have another sushi place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Nice clean little Japanese Resturant , good service, I drive 30 plus minutes to eat here, 1-2 times a week, food is good and fresh ."}
{"text":"We went for reverse happy hour, which was pretty cool. We sat at the sushi bar. They have so many choice for sushi rolls to chose from, it was a tough choice. WI can't remember what rolls we got, but we will definitely go back to try more. My boyfriend got nigiri and said the fish was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Some issues with getting seated. Need a boss on site. That said Cindy was fantastic and the sushi was on the mark."}
{"text":"I am the worst Yelp account owner. This is my second review EVER but I couldn't help but rave about this place. Sushi is on point and service is friendly and very quick. Love the ambiance, it is everything our neighborhood needed. Prices are super reasonable. Downfall, they're waiting on their liquor license, but waitress told us to grab a drink next door and food would be ready in 15. Should have by mid-end September 2015. Sushiholic is a must! A well deserved rave review"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night. Huge line of people, however, our wait was only 25 min. Great rolls, waiters were very helpful, clean and great Saturday night atmosphere."}
{"text":"We did not have a good experience at this restaurant and we were so looking forward to a new sushi restaurant in the neighborhood. The sushi was fishy tasting and they added wasabi to the kids sushi without asking us first. I am hopeful that they will make improvements in the future."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The service was awesome!  I've never gone to a sushi restaurant where you have every picture of the sushi on its menu. That was definitely one of the things I very much enjoyed.  The sushi was amazing. Great taste. The monkey brains oh my! Tuna stuffed mushrooms then fried!   Who would have thought! I definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Pros: Sushi was fresh and of good quality  Good Arcadia location Ample parking   Cons: Service is very slow (took 45 to receive our order on a not busy Tuesday) Limited drink/beer selection"}
{"text":"I've had Sam as my server twice and she is so sweet and attentive! If you want to sit at the sushi bar make sure you get a spot in front of Kevin! He is fun to talk to. The place has a great vibe, even better food and the prices are incredible! It's an Arcadia secret that must get out!"}
{"text":"Blame it on the atmosphere, sake bombs, service, or food, but I had a blast at Sushiholic!  I was initially hesitant to try this place--too tiny, I thought. Couldn't I see that great things come in small packages?  Let's talk atmosphere. I shy from \"hip\" as it usually means \"really really loud music.\" An exception will be made for Sushiholic, however, as it's just the right vibe for a group outing. Feels like an off-the-beach accessible hang out reminiscent of PB San Diego: casual, well-designed, and lively. Probably due to the clatter being caused by happy diners rather than over-compensating music. Staff was confident and attentive. They really did a lot with a little space.  Now it's easy to see were Sushiholic comprimises, and that's in portion size. Rolls are little morsels, small enough, in fact, that we considered how dexterous the chef must be to roll such dainty sushi...Maybe it was the sake bombs, but I found this pretty forgiving as long as the sushi was good, which it was. Could see myself being a little frustrated spending $13 on a roll, though luckily most spanned a reasonable price range. Marking up the laminated menu was fun, I felt like an eager kindergartener filling in an activity handout. So let's talk sushi...  I'm an enthusiast, if not necessarily expert, and found the sushi menu exciting. Eel, salmon, opah, varieties of tuna, and shrimp make appearances. Each roll we tried was distinct and flavorful. Quality was as expected, but at least items were creative. Bonus points for featuring a picture next to each description! Plenty to try on the third, fourth or fifth...or sixth..visit!  PS - Usually test the nigiri when trying a new place, but was out-voted in favor of Monkey Brains: deep fried mushrooms & spicy tuna, drizzled with mayo and eel sauce. Not always into the deep fried, but oooh~ these were good."}
{"text":"I am a sushi server but come here on my days off..the sushi is amazing and the service is extraordinary too! Come see sushi chef Felipe and server Kathy for an amazing sushi experience! Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  They have a great happy hour and lots of interesting and delicious sushi at a reasonable price.  They're also low on the \"attitude\" scale meaning they're a friendly environment and they make you feel genuinely welcomed."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood Japanese restaurant loved it. The ambiance and food are good. Very well located and plenty of parking. For desert se went to the neighbor!"}
{"text":"The name will catch you, the food will make you come back.  Parking is limited, but it worth the trouble. Great service the food is on point."}
{"text":"Well I do like sushiholic until today.. I took my two co-workers with me to have lunch today.  Food is okay, however: why is it that they have to serve the sushi ordered separately -- by two individual people in the same plate.. This grosses me out.. I prefer having my own order on my own plate!!!"}
{"text":"Was there for happy hour, the place had a Comfortable atmosphere, food is good, reasonably priced. Excellent service, particularly enjoyed the Sapporo and the fried calamari."}
{"text":"Okay, Sushiholic, you're really stinking convenient for me. I've become a fan of these specific things:  -bar top service during busy hours. Guys behind the counter are super attentive. I prefer the bar over the tables because the service is better, though the late LATE night service is on point.  -Korean BBQ ribs. Trust me. They are the best I've had out so far (though I still need to venture to some east side Korean spots), and the appetizer version is plenty and only $8.  -Uni. It's $7 for a nigiri order and I dig it. Most places charge $3+ for the same portion, but I'm not an uni expert by any means.  -Your almost around the clock happy hour. I like getting $4 yellowtail nigiri at most times of the day. It's not melt in your mouth incredible, but it does the job."}
{"text":"Don't miss out on the Monkey Brains!  Cocktails are strong, service is great.  Prices are high but the food is worth it!  Open late and my go to spot for Sushi at night!"}
{"text":"Delicious place to eat. Was there the first time there for me today! And I ordered fried calamari. It came with soy sauce, some red spicy sauce (I know this is terribly informal but I don't know the names of the sauces). They served it with lemon slices and everything was so fresh. The service was great and everyone was very nice. I wish I could have eaten in because it was so calm inside and the lights were at the perfect strength. Highly recommend! So much to choose from!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a bunch of times already. The hands down best roll is the Four Seasons roll! All of the rolls are good actually. Their happy hour starts at 8pm and goes til late now :) Great atmosphere and can't be beat prices. We love our new neighborhood sushi place and come here at least once a week now. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really great place but the best girl is gone, Carla, loved her. Happy hour is worth it."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed sushiholic! It was on a whim that we went here and we weren't disappointed.  I loved all of the rolls we got, I believe the red dragon, spicy tuna, cali, & crazy horse.  All were great and I would have again. My favorite was the red dragon but then again I'm also the Mother of Dragons so that's kind of a given. We both had our own sake and both were great.  Service was very attentive and I wish we were better at keeping receipts because when I drink I forget servers names, but I'll try and find it out and update my review!  Cool atmosphere, we were a bit over-dressed but wasn't a big deal.  People were in all types of wear there!"}
{"text":"The only complaint is that parking is a little hard to find at times, but we always find a spot ultimately so it's fine. There's happy hour here so you can come with friends or family and still stay in budget. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Great spot for Arcadia area, extensive happy hour and better hours than most places. Our family of 5 was seated within 15 minutes on a packed Tuesday night. Staff was friendly and professional. Kid/infant friendly. We were very happy and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Update: the sushi was only decent, not particularly fresh tasting, even by Phoenix standards.    I haven't eaten the food yet, but I am very disappointed with the disorganized service here.  I placed an order over the phone to be ready for pickup at 6:30pm (I called over an hour in advance).  It is now 7pm and the food is not yet ready.  Really?"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, place was full, and noisy and crowded.  Server was great, very nice and funny.  Happy hour prices were good, so we ordered up some fried calimari which was too greasy, then we had several rolls, (Rainbow, Shrimp tempura, Spicy California), but nothing really stood out.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. Ended up not finishing all of our rolls, we just didn't find it compelling enough.  We probably won't return, there are plenty other places for sushi that are better, less crowded and quieter."}
{"text":"I come here mostly for lunch. Best place around in the Arcadia area! Did their happy hour the other night and that was a great deal! If you want to try it out do the reverse happy hour first!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience and restaurant! Let's start with our server Samantha. What a great personality. She made us feel comfortable and gave us great tips. Next the sushi. WOW it was delicious! Best roll of the night was the First Love. The only thing that made me not give it 5 Stars was the parking. Awful just awful looking for a place to park. Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Fast and prompt service. Environment is clean and comfortable. We had the shrimp tempura roll. It's yummy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm extremely particular about sushi or any fish, and this place is quality!!! I have been to probably 15 different sushi spots, or places that offer sushi, and none of them touch the quality and presentation of this place. Great happy hour deals too! Everyone is very welcoming and the sushi chefs are always so nice and ask me what I want, even if it's something I want to make specifically for me : ) SOOO in love with this place!"}
{"text":"This is the hot topic in my book.  I've been to too many sushi Restaurants and by all this would be,by far the best quality of food in my book,  staff are 100% genuine and the crowd that comes here are friendly and awesome.    This place is considered on my top places to go to in my book.  I suggest you try this place and tell me I'm wrong."}
{"text":"Waiter extremely helpful with suggestions for new combinations.  Excellent recommendations"}
{"text":"I'm not wild about ordering thru a waitress at the sushi bar. After eating  sushi for 35 yrs 1-2x per week in CA, they're just sort if unnecessary.  Freshness of fish here okay.  Also not fond if the sushi being pre cut. Meh..."}
{"text":"Nigiri was some of the best I've had! Also fairly reasonably priced with a large menu and nice happy hour deals.  Service was also 5 stars, and everything came out very fast."}
{"text":"The owner, Masa, served me, and I told him that I picked this place from Yelp, being from the beach cities and not knowing the hood, but I own a place nearby.   It had 5-stars at the time, and with my review--5more to add to the average. The food is fresh, with and artistic flair and presentation, the people here are interesting, and I'm sure Masa's 3rd venture will be another sweet success for all of us."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and great service.    I went for happy hour with my mother while visiting Phx last week and it was great."}
{"text":"Saw the new sushi place in the neighborhood and had to check it out.  Loved it. Great buildout and interior design, clean, well priced, fresh, and really friendly staff. Head chef was Japanese and said something I couldn't understand on the way in, so you know it's authentic."}
{"text":"Seriously??  In AZ??  A real awesome find full of fresh fish a great atmosphere and interesting combinations.  I am a hard critic when it comes to sushi and this place does not disappoint. The yellow tail was fresh, the toro was generous,  I strongly recommend checking this place out if you are even close and driving a bit if you are not.   There are a finite number of meals that we get to enjoy and this one will leave you glad you added it to the list!"}
{"text":"Best Bento Box in the valley. The sushi is really clean, the portions are great and they have a reverse happy hr. What else do you want? The part I really like is that they understand how to treat Arcadites. They're friendly without being pretentious and are excited about being part of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love this place! Happy hour is basically all the time. The prices are fair and I sushi is very good. I would say it's definitely a great value.  Everything seems to be made fresh which is super important to me.  They have tons and tons of options on the menu and because the price is right it's fun to try lots of different things. My favorite spot to get sushi"}
{"text":"Sushi is great and happy hour is awesome they even have reverse happy hour. Fried rice is my go to!"}
{"text":"Spectacular sushi place!!! Service was superb!!!! (Sep) our waiter was very helpful with the menu and specials for the evening! Drinks appetizers and main course were brought out orderly and in a timely manner!!! Food was delicious everything we ordered was devoured my daughter and I are very picky when it comes to sushi we try new places abut and if it's not worth it we won't review it . The best part of this restaurant they serve real wasabi something you don't see with hardly any sushi restaurants so it your in the area drop in and experience it for yourself thank SEP and Sushiholic for making our daughter mom date night very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I love sushi and am always looking for a good spot.  I tried this place today for lunch and the place was dark like most sushi spots,  why?  I like being able to see my food and especially sushi.  I got a to go order,  the guy that took my order may have been new he kept repeating what I said over the phone but when I opened my order it was wrong.  I ordered the cherry blossom roll and spicy tuna rolls,  I asked for no rice on my spicy tuna roll but it had rice.  I also didnt get extra cucumber a d ginger like I asked for.  It was good but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was surprised by the quality of the sushi from the rave reviews.  It's pretty mediocre sushi -- not bad quality for fish considering it is Arizona, but the rice wasn't the best. But I also guess this is the quality you get for happy hour sushi.  Came with a group of four and were seated immediately. We all got drinks for their happy hour and shared calamari. Their calamari was a little different from other places, but would recommend getting!  For drinks, I got a sinful geisha. Definitely a good choice for people who do not like the taste of hard alcohol, and I am definitely one of those people. Basically tastes like juice!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in town! I highly recommend the first love roll, so delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!! Spicy Garlic Edamame is the way to go. Thank you Sep for making the experience even better! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here because I had seen good reviews for it and was craving sushi. This place definitely did the trick! The sushi was extremely fresh and was a great price since we came during happy hour! I will definitely be back here if I'm in the area! I was not able to find a full menu online but when I got the the restaurant they had a lot of options for sushi rolls.  The atmosphere is nice and or server was attentive."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. Every time we go it's great. Service is always good. Can be crowded but they always seem to handle it pretty good. As for the food...we've never had a bad meal! Big selection and priced just right. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"O-M-G ! I think I just had the best Sushi Roll I have ever tasted. Its called a Booty Booty Roll (TOP) ; it has deep fried tempura shrimp & cream cheese rolled into rice, and then deep fried again for extra crunch. Next to that is a Bento Box with chicken teriyaki and potstickers. This was our first time here, but I kid you not, it will not be our last. Good food, great prices, and phenomenal service. My name is Randy, and I am a Sushiholic !"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner with a great friend of mine Friday last week. Our server Sarah was amazing, helped make the experience wonderful! Thank you so much to her and the rest of the staff for making the expericance one to Yelp about!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for happy hour (which is all day), everything was really good.  Started with the Komodo Dragon to drink.   If you like Chambord, this is really good.  It's sake, Chambord and vodka.  I really liked it.  For apps, had the crispy tuna, which is basically fried rice topped with tuna and jalapenos.  Also had the crab wontons.  They were both very good.  I especially enjoyed the rolls though.  We had a shrimp tempura with avocado topped with eel sauce, and I think the other was spicy crab."}
{"text":"Great addition to Arcadia - and now they have a liquor license so complete happy hours offering. Great family place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner at the sushi bar after meetings in Phoenix.  I got a seat at the sushi bar and was well taken care of all evening.  I got a sashimi sampler that was excellent as well a second climax roll.  Both were excellent though I was considerably impressed by the quality and thoughtful preparation of sashimi on the sampler.  I also had nigori sake (not sure of the brand) that was delicious.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious! The hamachi was so fresh! The wait staff was excellent and the sushi was prepared promptly."}
{"text":"One of the better Sushi places in Phoenix... Super service, fresh sea creatures and amazing flavor combos. Naughty ninjas and saki sangrias mucho Bueno gracias! Crowded but worth it. Small things with big surprises."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  We are fairly new to town and in our quest to find our sushi place we hit the jackpot!    Great prices and great quality. It can become busy as the space isn't large but they seem to keep it moving and we have never been stuck waiting too long."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and after seeing the menu I decided to come here for lunch on my 21st birthday. I was not disappointed, the sushi was absolutely delicious and the service was great. The waitress made great recommendations for my \"first\" alcoholic beverage, and I enjoyed two tasty cocktails. This place is pretty small with a really cool atmosphere. My favorite part was their unique roll menu, I'll have to come back to try them all! My only complaint is that there was no free birthday desert (since RAW/Stingray/other sushi joints usually have that) but I understand why they might not want to do that sort of thing and the food was so good I didn't really mind haha."}
{"text":"I LOVE sushiholic and I'm so glad they are in my neighborhood! The sushi is some of the best I've ever had. The staff is great and the happy hour specials are so cheap! Five stars!"}
{"text":"Visiting the area, we stumbled upon this place in a strip mall type setting. Although the location is somewhat undesirable (there is nothing really cool about neighboring with a CVS/Walgreens type store) the interior is well done and modern.  They have a great menu for sushi and decent beverages, but our service was a bit slow from our particular waiter. She was nice, which helped, but wasn't in any rush to come back to our table to check in on us... eh whatever, at least the sushi kept us happy!"}
{"text":"I love this place for happy hour 2:00pm - 8:00pm then reverse happy hour from 8:00pm till close that's 12 straight hours of pure happy hour happiness. I submit does it get any better than this!!"}
{"text":"This is our first visit here. We liked the atmosphere and staff. We ordered 3 different rolls and an appetizer everything was delicious and fresh!!! If you order a spicy roll they deliver on it! (Finally someone that knows what spicy is) Very satisfied will definitely come back and recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Found this place because I was looking for a late-night sushi spot. Was pleasantly surprised by the quality and freshness of the fish. This place is no joke. I've been back twice sense. Definitely give it a try and put it on your list."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  The service was great!  Everything wad reasonably priced.  Definitely order the baked lobster roll and muscles."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sushi spot. Good prices and friendly service. They even had gluten-free soy sauce. Be sure to try the fresh wasabi."}
{"text":"Second climax roll was good. Decor could us a touch but not required. Good and attentive service. Would return!"}
{"text":"Quaint sushi bar with a great reverse happy hour menu!!!! Service is amazing and so fast. The sushi was fantastic. Try the monkey brain if you like mushrooms and the volcano roll. The only small complaint I have is about the gyoza dipping sauce, it was way too bitter."}
{"text":"First time here, and I have to say I was very impressed.  The staff was so nice and friendly.  I came with a friend so we got to try a lot of food, and all of it was amazing!  The monkey brain was great to start with and the Bento Holic lunch special is perfect, and quite filling.  We also got a few rolls off the regular menu and they were great, especially the Climax Roll.  Will definitely be coming back often, especially since there is only a few good sushi spots in the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"It's happy hour all night! 3-8 is happy hour and 8-close is reverse happy hour. Amazing prices for the rolls. We did spicy tuna, rainbow and vegas, they were all great. The place filled up by 6:30 on a Monday night. Nothing fancy, but great spot to stop in with friends and family and share some rolls!"}
{"text":"According to my wife, sometimes I can be a self-important a-hole.    And I certainly was when I sat down at Sushiholic. I was hot and hangry. I was certainly looking to get triggered about cultural appropriation and start grumbling about how non-Japanese the food was.   I started off complaining how there were too many choice in the menu. Then I started worrying that the service was too good/friendly, preventing me from my bad mood continuing. And the lunch specials were ridiculously cheap - surely something was wrong with it.   But dish after dish ended up being really good. And really authentic - within reason. Look, this is AZ stripmall sushi, so don't expect Tsukiji market fish and Roppongi sushi chefs.  But this is darn good stuff. And cheap!    And the thing that really pleased me? A spoon-sized serving of potato salad. After World War II, Japanese (including Japanese-Americans who lived in the US) adopted mayo as their second favorite condiment - after shoyu/soy sauce. If you travel the streets of Ginza or Hawaii, you'll see potato salad and other mayo-based foods everywhere. Don't ask me why, it just is.   And like other Japanese dishes, quality/beauty comes before everything else. So I got a perfect little thimble-sized portion of potato salad, just like my grandma used to make. It was a little a little wink and nod to me saying \"we got you, fam.\"  Yes. Yes, you do. And I love you for that."}
{"text":"The place is outstanding. Great sushi and Spicy Noodles. Highly recommended. Good service."}
{"text":"We ordered a few rolls (rainbow roll, Philly, and yellowtail) and the spicy tuna on top of crispy rice. Although my non-sushi loving husband (he can tolerate it, just doesn't LOVE it) thought the fish to rice ratios were a little skimp, we both agreed the quality and flavors were fantastic. Our server recommended the fresh wasabi (for a small fee) and it was AMAZING!  We also tried the spicy garlic edamame, which was just \"eh\".  My daughter ordered the teriyaki beef bowl from the kids menu. It was a pretty large serving with fresh steamed veggies, but also lacked some \"oomph\". It was a beautiful night to sit on the patio, luckily, because it was pretty loud inside. All in all, great service and a delish meal."}
{"text":"We ordered the calamari tempura as an appetizer and was pretty good. But do never order the Sweet Thang unless you want a roll only with cream cheese. The fish piece on the roll was soooo tiny that I could barely taste it, all I could taste was the cream cheese. I complained but nothing was done. Don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"This place does NOT have Sushi Happy Hour specials. Instead, they have lunch specials until 2, a menu that they call HH from 2-8 and then a reverse HH from 8-12. That is NOT a special menu. That's a regular menu. And the food is really not good.   Our Rainbow Roll was about 30% smaller than most places I've been and it included mayonnaise mixed with imitation crab inside the roll. The spicy salmon roll was pre-mixed, the gyoza was breaded and then fried. Strange.   But the oddest of all is when I asked \"Why do your pictures make the tuna look so wonderfully red but your current tuna looks so different?\" Their answer was \"Oh, we just have a different cut of the tuna tonight\".  No, that's not why. It's because you're buying cheap fish..."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best happy hour and fresh sushi. The happy hour is great since it ends at 8 versus other places 530 or 6."}
{"text":"I LOVE SUSHI. Saw all the reviews, was in the area after a workout at The Village and wanted some sea-based protein.  Decently busy for a Tuesday night, I arrived at 9 pm.  Ordered takeout - yellowtail sashimi and 2 specialty rolls.  Hostess had me pay (and tip) before food was ready.    It was a good thing she had me pay first.  I sat at the front waiting, unattended, for the next 45 minutes.  No one checked with me, asked if I needed help, noticed other patrons seated and leaving and yet I was still there.  I asked a staff member to check on my order after 40 mins, and she did not return.  I saw serving and sushi staff pack up and leave.    Finally after 45 minutes, I got up and approached all the remaining wait staff about my order.  They had no idea, and after searching the sushi bar, found my order packaged and waiting.  I asked to speak to the manager, and staff said there was no manager.  I worked in restaurants from 14 years old until I became a physician, don't lie to me like that.    Got home frustrated, and found my sushi to be decent, but the ingredients were haphazard, rolls were small for the price, and the slicing of the rolls themselves asymmetric.  Yellowtail sashimi was tasty.  Earned 2 stars only for taste.  Completely dissatisfied with my experience."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was surprised by the quality of sushi. These are rather mediocre sushi - not a bad quality for fish. Definitely a good choice for people who do not like the taste of real fish."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for first time this past week! I sat down and was waiting for my friend. No one stopped by 20 min passed and I reached out to someone passing by asked for my server so I couldn't at least have some water. A bit disappointed on unprofessional non responsive staff. I ordered cocktail and two sushi rolls.my friend got sashimi. Sushi qualify was ok nothing super fresh. I liked that their menu had a picture for each sushi and they had variety. Overall an ok experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, they have great food and great service. They even offer kids meal options. The sushi prices were great and I really like the Ramen. This is now my favorite Sushi spot in Phoenix. The reverse happy hour makes it easy to take a date night or take the family out without busting the budget."}
{"text":"We shared a bunch of rolls and sashimi along with ramen and teriyaki salmon.  Everything was fine but nothing amazing.  The prices were reasonable and service was attentive."}
{"text":"Coming from living in Hawaii and parts of Asia, I'd say this is as close as it gets to authentic Japanese food here in Phoenix. The happy hour prices are very reasonable and the servings are great. Also a nice modern vibe!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a fantastic sushi place in Arcadia! The Happy Hour goes until 8pm and you can get awesome food at great prices! They use dry erase markers which makes it easy to order a ton of delicious food! The kids menu is top notch- really- a variety of great options my daughter loves the California roll/shrimp sushi option and the udon was a big hit. The gyoza is light and yummy. I have not had a Las Vegas roll before but wow it was delicious! The Salmon Kama was moist and flavorful! Mr. Kim - who I think is the owner -made a table visit and was incredibly nice. Great food and local family owned- I am a new fan!"}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant is perfectly fitting for me - Sushiholic. They were able to seat my friend and I immediately on a Tuesday evening around 8pm. The happy hour menu has pretty good deals. I got 2 orders of nigiri, miso soup, and 2 rolls for ~$20 pre tax/tip. The restaurant was full and the service was satisfactory. The fish had great texture and tasted fresh. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Food was basically edible and very expensive. The sushi was basic, but what really made me sad was how bad the cocktails are! It's pretty much dive bar quality for premium Scottsdale prices."}
{"text":"Wow this place has amazing sushi. Fish was fresh and rolls melted in your mouth. Rice was cooked perfect. Also the owner Masa is super friendly. It's nice to actually see the owner conversing with his customers. This is the best sushi around hands down."}
{"text":"Our server Chloe gave us a great experience. She was very fun, bubbly, really paid attention to our table and didn't forget about us.  The sushi was delicious and desserts were almost as sweet as her"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's happy hour pretty much all the time. The rolls are on the small to average side but the price makes up for it. You can really order a variety of things to try without breaking the bank. I've been here many times and it's always been a good experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food,, great service, great sushi. I can't say anything bad about this place. So pleased I finally stopped in. I had the bento box, my partner had the combo sushi platter. AWESOME."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good for the middle of the desert but the chef we had wouldnt speek 2 words to us.  We're used to sushi chefs who enjoy their customers. This one didnt seem to like his job too much."}
{"text":"I came on a Saturday night, so of course it was busy. But since I was by myself I was able to get seating immediately at the bar. My server was super helpful, and the sushi was great. I got monkey brains as my appetizer - not bad, but I couldn't taste the fish so much because the mushroom overpowered it. The rolls I went with were the school bus and the volcano (deep fried -yum!-). The detox cocktail I ordered was just okay. I couldn't taste much cranberry juice, just the sake and cucumber vodka. Wonderful food and service -- I will definitely come back to try other special rolls!"}
{"text":"Great sushi with great prices, especially if you order off the happy hour or reverse happy hour menu"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted this place to be good because 1. Akai Hana is so far away and 2. because the happy hour pricing looked OK.  Unfortunately, the rolls are quite small and disappointing. I understand that I only ordered from the happy hour menu but having just went to Akai Hana a couple days prior, I had high expectations.  To their credit, I will say that we were served fairly quickly and the venue itself was nice. I liked the staff. They were very attentive.  We came in at 5:45pm on a Thursday afternoon. No wait, and we had speedy service.  The best rolls from their happy hour menu: Las Vegas roll (surprisingly, really really good) and the crunchy tuna roll (not bad but underwhelmingly small).  Unfortunately, not worth the trek from Tempe. Sorry Sushiholic."}
{"text":"Finally a sushi spot in my neighborhood that I can enjoy! We ordered the amigo roll, the bell and my hubs good ol' fave, the Vegas roll. My favorite was the amigo. It was fresh and had a lil bit of a kick. Our waitress was super sweet but you can tell they're still working out on some kinks...customer attentiveness declined as the our time there went by and no liquor license..yet! . (Liquor license coming in, in two weeks) we'll be visiting this place real soon."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Its delicious! Saturday night they are busy but no wait, we got seated right away and the reversed happy hour had just started. Woooohoooo!  Our waiter Sap was awesome. He gave use some suggestion on items we should try. And they were goooooood!  We had the Rainbow roll, California Crunchy roll,  Tootsie roll and a scalup roll.  My husband also had the Champon soup which he loved. This should be a stop for you suchi lovers out there.  Atmosphere is loungie, nice music in the back round. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and we finally did today! This place did not disappoint! The sushi was amazing and tasted fresh! The service was great! Sep was our server and took great care of us! We loved the specialty rolls! Pretty decent happy hour! This is definitely going to be our new sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Always amazing food. Love the Shoyu ramen and the fresh fish..we'll eat all of it, but our favorites are the Ono (Hawaiian white tuna) Hamachi (Yellowtail) and Hirami (Halibut). Great Happy Hour. Really friendly staff."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun, but unfortunately the service and size of the special rolls lacked. I'm sure they are still experiencing growing pains, so hopefully I can re-eval in the future..."}
{"text":"We came into town to look at property. We stayed at the Omni in Paradise Valley and everything shuts down by 10pm! Saturday night rolls around and I yelped late night dining and stumbled onto this gem! Sep, one of the servers, was AMAZING! As a business owner, if I could get my hands on employees that treated the business as their own like him I'd only be so lucky! Impressive!! Sushi was fresh and they had great variety. I would ABSOLUTELY come back!!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute fun atmosphere. Incredibly fast, thoughtful service. We sat at the bar and became fast friends with the very attentive sushi chef. Rolls were perfectly fresh and delicious. Wish we lived here so we could come at least once a week! Thanks Yelp for clueing us into this fantastic place."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. The pricing and quality is the best we have found in AZ. The staff is also amazing. We have made this our go to Sushi spot."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi spot since we moved to AZ. We're used to CA sushi and this is the closest we've found. Their California and Spicy Tuna rolls are our favorite. They have lots of fresh sashimi and specialty rolls too. We love to finish off our meal with the spicy Korean noodle soup!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place and have started to go there weekly. I used to go to a sushi place just down the street, but I don't think we will go back to that old place. Sushiholic is so good and fresh every single time. The rolls are a great price and happy hour is amazing. The individual pieces are the perfect size and ratio of fish to rice. Every time we go, we try something different and we haven't found anything that we have not liked yet."}
{"text":"Went there with the family in the afternoon and enjoyed the experience. Staff is very friendly and attentive to kids. We ordered rolls and the grilled salmon entree. The food tasted good and the fish seemed to be of better quality. Definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"Great sushi for a very affordable price. Our server Sep was very    friendly and helpful, he recommended a few new options and we were not dissapointed! More than a sushi place, I had a ramen bowl and it was very flavorful and the bowl was bigger than my head. Recommended, excellent service."}
{"text":"Love this gem!  We've eaten there twice, now, and will be eating at Sushiholic weekly.  If you're looking for a quick, delicious Happy Hour, or delicious Asian dinner in the Corridor/Arcadia, look no further.   They have some interesting drinks, as well as the standbys of Saki and Kirin.  Sushi is fresh and good, Spicy tune roll is definitely spicy, and the Tempura is really light, while the veggies inside are cooked just right. The atmosphere is kind of hip and comfortable.  Some of the other area sushi bars are too loud for me to enjoy myself, or a conversation, so the quieter vibe  here is great. Great service!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona!!  I was super surprised at how fresh everything was.  The owner was so nice too!!!  I would go back again and again"}
{"text":"Sushiholic has a great reputation here in the valley. I had gone there for lunch and had ordered the 3 roll special for $10.50. The price was great, the atmosphere was cool, but I was a little disappointed in the food. It tasted great but just did not live up tot her hype in my opinion"}
{"text":"This is one of my bookmarked placed I wish I had tried earlier. On a lunch visit, I started with a mild and refreshing order of silken tofu; this was followed by a chicken katsu bentoholic - a bento lunch with chicken katsu, rice, salad, a side (cucumber salad was my choice), miso soup, and a sushi roll (I chose spicy tuna); it was an excellent assortment and quite a generous amount of food.   On a happy hour visit, I had a calamari tempura; these came not as standard rings but as big tasty strips of panko-crusted squid. This was followed by a spicy salmon roll and shrimp nigiri; hot sake perfectly complemented the cool happy hour bites.   Dining and happy hour pleasure factor was enhanced by the relaxed, casual atmosphere and friendly service. And you have to love a sushi restaurant that not only serves really good sushi bar food but also has happy hour from 2 pm to 8 pm, immediately followed by reverse happy hour that lasts till closing time."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving sushi one night and since she is an actual sushiholic, this place was perfect. Happy hour until 8:00 everyday people! Can't get better than that. We order a ton of food and two cocktails during HH and the bill was around $50. Not bad. Our server was Sep, he was super nice and since I love ginger he brought me the largest portion of ginger I've ever seen upon request.   I will definitely be back here for the tasty food, prices, and great service!"}
{"text":"Truly enjoy the atmosphere and of course the fish! The specials never cease to amaze me and show the highest quality in selection, so if there's still some left, grab it while you can. Happy hour & Reverse happy hour show that this place has your evening well wrapped up. Can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Whoo-hoo! I found my go-to sushi spot in the neighborhood. First off, they have a fantastic happy and reverse happy hour. I had a not so great experience the first time I came here, the nigiri was choppy and perforated. Also, I wasn't a huge fan of the rolls with the eel sauce, because I found them way too sweet. They seem to have improved greatly since my first visit and I'm glad I gave them a second chance. Since my return I've had the salmon, yellow tail and tuna nigiri which was smooth, fresh tasting and cut properly. I also really enjoyed the Crazy roll which had tuna, yellowtail and avocado. I also asked if they could make a salmon skin handroll which was delicious with perfectly crispy salmon skin. This is definitely one of the best sushi spots in the Arcadia neighborhood and is a very welcome addition!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a great sushi spot. Service was amazing, server was sweet and very attentive. Sushi, edamame and monkey brains were absolutely delicious. Our sake bombs were a perfect pair with our food and apps. Ambience was very enjoyable because the lighting wasn't too bright and noise level was perfect..we were able to get tipsy and a little loud without anyone noticing or worse getting annoyed."}
{"text":"We stopped by late at night working in the area.  This place is awesome! At first glance you wonder how they can handle so many people, large crowds and being so busy.  They are awesome.  I have been there when they are slow and when they are slammed on a weekend.  They give you very consistent service.   Food is awesome, quality of sushi is great, the sushi bar takes great pride in their work!  Would highly recommend.  Reverse happy hour is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Just came back home from this place. Maybe I was just expecting too much after reading all the positive reviews, but I was a bit shocked when entering the restaurant. It felt small and overly crowded, the acoustic wasn't great, it felt very noisy.  My boyfriend and I first started with some hot sake, that we both found very nice! We were very excited to get sushi, but I found the happy hour sushi menu short and not very original. I therefore ordered some more from the non-happy hour menu.  Overall the sushi was ok, the fish was definitely fresh. However, I feel the price-quality ratio is not very satisfying, I could have had the same quality at an all you can eat."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok, nothing to get excited about. Portions were a little small, the environment was decent."}
{"text":"If you know me, you would know that I travel 45 minutes 4 times a year for my favorite sushi place Sushi Style. When I saw the menu for Sushiholic I think I started to tear up because I realized it was by the same owner! Even more dangerous is that I work right across the street.   They have a $9 lunch special that keeps me coming back. With it comes:  -miso soup -salad w/ sesame vinaigrette  -a list of sushi rolls to pick from -salmon or chicken over a bed of vegetables -your choice of side including crab wontons, edamame, etc.  -a cup of white rice   They don't skimp out on the volume or quality just because it's lunch.  They are waiting on their liquor license at the moment so they don't have any beer/wine/spirits. I'm sure this will change soon as most restaurants in the area serve alcohol. They had a great bar at their other location.  UPDATE: They are now serving alcohol!"}
{"text":"An updated review for Sushiholic is a must! Since our first experience, we've been back multiple times and have been very pleased with each experience! It seems that they took the constructive feedback, had some staff turnover and are now on their \"A\" game!! This is such great news since we live down the street and happen to be 'sushiholics' ourselves!   First, I must start by saying that they have Happy Hour specials from 3PM until close! The prices are FANTASTIC and the sushi is fresh and made-to-order right in front of you.   But the BEST visit we've had was for lunch. They have an amazing bento box special for $9 and you literally get enough food for an army. Each meal comes with miso soup AND a salad (I love their ginger dressing!), choice of hot item (teriyaki chicken or salmon, katsu chicken, etc.), a BIG ball of rice, choice of a side (edamame, pot stickers, etc.), potato salad, choice of an entire sushi roll (YES, 8 pieces my friends!), and a fresh orange to cleanse your palate. Have you ever heard of so much food for $9??? We left so full and satisfied. Under $20 for two? I'll take it! I will absolutely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing prices were perfect and ill be coming back again. I would have given 5 but the service wasn't good. You had like 5 servers and only one working. He bussed his ass off. The females on the other hand were rude, eating in the kitchen and when the male server told the female servers that he needed the table that they were occupying. They would not move, it took 5 minute wait when the restaurant was empty. I don't want to see your employees eating, nor do i want to see them eating in the kitchen. Your male server was nice but not on point. Forgot a few things, no biggie though. ."}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi, everyone is a professional critic. Oh, this fish is fishy, this fish is low quality, this fish is only par at best, maybe I'm spoiled because I live next to some part of an ocean where the fish I'm eating doesn't actually live but that makes me think somehow it means all the fish is fresher, bla bla bla bla. Kill me.    Here is a fun interactive map that shows just how far your \"fresh\" fish travels to get to your mouth: http://www.columnfivemedia.com/work-items/interactive-where-does-your-sushi-come-from  So shut up about the fish already. It's all in the rice, people. Don't be a sushi-turd and think it's just in the fish. Sushi is my jam and this place made me dance."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant on a whim, and we are so glad that we did! First impression: restaurant was clean, well staffed, employees were very welcoming and friendly, and the wood decor & glowing fish design behind the sushi bar were aesthetically pleasing. We were seated rather quickly, which pleasantly surprised us since the restaurant looked full. Our server was very attentive, as were the other bussers/wait staff. HH pricing is awesome. We started with miso soup and shrimp tempura- both were delicious, and we ordered a second round of the shrimp tempura because we enjoyed it so much. Next we ordered a variety of rolls- one with lemon on top, one fried, a few simple rolls- all were robust with flavor and very fresh. For dessert we ordered the mochi ice cream- coffee & green tea were both delicious. We will definitely be back soon, and highly recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi, poor service.  Sushi was good for the price they offer, especially during happy hour.  All the appetizers seem store bought, not made in restaurant.    Server was attentive until we ordered, but was very difficult to pay our bill and leave.  We probably spent about 15 minutes looking around, obviously looking for our server, and no other servers stopped by to help or inquire if we needed anything.  We eventually got up and asked for our bill.    Sushi was good, but due to the poor service probably will not be back."}
{"text":"What a welcome addition to the Arcadia neighborhood--the rolls (school bus and over the rainbow, along with many others) are different than I have had elsewhere--it's great! I love the indoor/outdoor patio feel of the place, as well."}
{"text":"Holy cow this is THE BEST sushi we've had in YEARS in the Phoenix valley.  Service = 5 food = 5   Ambiance =5  . We has shrimp tempura (perfectly golden, light, and yummy), sushi yellowtail (buttery), tuna (silky), ebi tuna (sweet), salmon (lux), and a fun delicious shrimp tempura roll.  Oh,  and the miso soup was comforting perfection. Go here!!!"}
{"text":"Owner Masa has a hot on his hands.  He's got 2 other restaurants in the Valley, 7th St & Bell, and 67th Ave & Bell.  That experience shows at Sushiholic.  The menu is more extensive than any I've seen on a sushi place.  Printed on sturdy, laminated sheets in full color, you get a very good idea what all the specialty rolls will look like.  We enjoyed a seaweed salad, innovatively light crab puffs, Octopus sashimi, crunchy spicy tune a roll, cherry blossom roll, tuna lover's roll (with jalapeños and beautiful to look at, Sweet Thang roll (similar to a Las Vegas roll), and the fabulous baked lobster in sweet eel sauce over spicy tuna roll.  Many of the rolls come with their own sauces, so that diners aren't as tempted to drown everything in soy sauce.  Service is extremely knowledgeable and helpful, including the chance to try fresh wasabi.  Prices for items ranged from $3 to $12, typically $6-$8, and there are many combination plates available for those who are overwhelmed with all the choices.  We are sure to become regulars."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the atmosphere and the fact that it seems as though it is always Happy Hour! Recently I had the \"pick 3 for $10\" sushi happy hour special. All of the rolls we ordered were fresh and the seaweed salad was delicious."}
{"text":"My daughter took us for Happy Hour.  Prices were decent.  The Veggie Fried Rice was excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.  Staff was very attentive and prompt serving us; food arrived exceptionally fast. We had a great time -  will come back again as soon as we can. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Always attentive, remember who we are, what we drink & where we like to sit. Fish is good for being in the desert. Sushiholic is a solid Biltmore/Arcadia staple."}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi. Love the lion king roll and the Atkins roll! Happy hour is pretty normal price as most places. Great service as well.  Parking kind of sucks though. I wish I knew more of the \"not on the menu\" rolls because those are usually the best! Highly recommended for sushi!"}
{"text":"Walked in and immediately greeted!  The atmosphere is inviting and very friendly.  I just missed the lunch crowd but still able to get lunch prices before 3pm. No worries if you come after 3pm as happy hour starts right after lunch with great prices and selection.   I got tootsie roll and Philly roll for 7.95 For both. Excellent deal!  I will be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"First time at this fine establishment. I was searching on Yelp for a place to eat, and came across a picture of their Ramen. It looked Great! Arrived and ordered a bowl of Tonkatsu Ramen and a sushi roll. I have to say, They were both Great! The ramen is the best I've had in the Phoenix area. Atmosphere and Service are Wonderful as well. It was already getting pretty busy for the lunch rush, I can only imagine how busy this place will be once they get their liquor license. I plan to visit this place everytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"This should of been a five star review but due to the service it has to go down to 3.(i will definitely go again in hopes of my first time being a bad day)  The food itself was really good and tasted very fresh. We got a couple rolls and some nigiri. Tuna and salmon was super fresh and i ate through it like butter.   This place really gets busy during happy hour. Seems like a go to place for families with their kids but also the place to go after work for a bite and drinks.  Now for the service. Our server took forever to come the first time for our drink order and then again for our food. Twice i had to catch her for water refill. She added a roll we had not ordered. I advise her of this but she didn't offer to take it back(and it was in the middle if everything),  however it was still charged. Just not friendly service and somewhat uptight. I will definitely come back for the food but not for the service(looking around the asian servers seemed very nice and sweet)."}
{"text":"Fine sushi that even the pickiest connoisseur will appreciate. Personally I always order a Rainbow Roll and it never fails to live up to my expectations. The Sashimi is also excellent, salmon is tastiest I have had the pleasure of enjoying in Phoenix. Well deserved 5 stars, expect crowds on Friday and Saturday nights as well."}
{"text":"I love Sushiholic. I'm giving it four stars instead of five because I can name 3 other places that have better sushi but Sushiholic is definitely in my top 5 sushi places of all time.   PRICE: No other sushi place can beat the prices at Sushiholic. I feel like they are on happy hour all day. You can get two sushi rolls for $7 during lunch hours.   FOOD: Their sushi is tasty and the fish is ALWAYS fresh. Their seaweed salad comes in a big bowl and is delicious. Their soft shell crab is good, so are the gyoza, potato wrapped shrimp and shrimp shumai. I am not a fan of the crab wontons, and this dish they have that has fresh tuna on topped of rice and fried together.   SERVICE: Service is always excellent here, from the servers to the owner to the sushi chefs. They are passionate about the restaurant and the food."}
{"text":"A new addition to the Arcadia area. The happy hour menu is great, with variety, the portion sizes are generous. The sushi was very fresh.  What can I say about the atmosphere? The hostess extraordinaire made us feel very welcome. I have a feeling this spot is going to be very popular, especially since I immediately ran into a friend when I dropped in on a whim. Oh, and the owner came out to say hello, which was a very nice touch indeed."}
{"text":"Staff was great!  The fish was tasty, too (always nervous to get sushi on Monday night - after the weekend rush, but the fish was top notch).  The Nigiri was very good, but I thought the maki rolls were a bit on the sweet side.  They opened the wall up when it cooled down - made for a nice atmosphere.    Check them out!"}
{"text":"Our experience at Sushiholic was largely due to the exceptional guidance of our waiter, Sep. Based on his recommendations, we tried fresh Spanish mackerel sashimi (see pic), several rolls--Guilty pleasure and baked lobster--and several appetizers--tofu (yum!), edamame, and miso soup. Everything we tried was simply amazing, both in taste and presentation.  We were so impressed that we sought to return a second night, only to find them closed on Sundays--sigh!"}
{"text":"The sushi is great! I mean this is my second time coming here and the food did not disappoint. Both times I've came around 9:30pm. So it's nice atmosphere , busy but there is a table open.   Why I'm only giving 4 out of 5 stars is because they need better staffing. One sweet waitress to run it all alone is not good for her or hungry guest.   I first came in to a sign stating \" please wait to be seated\" okay fine. I'm waiting but no one sees me! No one is manning the door and I don't see serves walking the floor only the men behind the sushi bar and three server looking ladies by the register. Finally one of them sees me after about 2 minutes. I'm seated and told my server would be right with me... Yeah um.   The couple to my right got up and moved to the sushi bar because they had been there before me and had no water /drinks or food on their table. They finally got water and decided to move to the sushi bar where they got prompt attention /notice.   Then another couple comes in , by this time I'd been waiting for 10 minutes without any service. I know because I was watching the time on my phone.  Now I'm not a shy person or by any means afraid to speak up but there were not even enough staff near by to signal or call out to one without getting out from behind my table to walk over to this register people keep loving to stand behind.   I finally get water from a bus boy who I watched go over and notify the server people had been waiting .   Once my server finally came I had marked my sushi list and knew my drink order so it was all ordered right away when she came over. She was very polite and has great people skills. I'd seen her last time we were there however she did not wait on us. She did her job well. I wasn't checked on until I was finished with my food but with her manning the entire room I can't even be upset. She really was doing the best one person could with 8 tables of all different party numbers.   Please get more servers at night it will be greatly appreciated! I'll totally go back, it's just a bummer to have to wait for extended times when hungry."}
{"text":"Quick fast and cheap: it's one of my favorite sushi spots to hit especially during happy hour. I love the rolls because they don't have a lot of rice so the rolls are purely all ingredients. It's small and dark inside but it's a great place to grab a quick bite . I am here every single week so for you sushi lovers, it's the spot to go to. Some of my favorite rolls are the school bus, four seasons, Snow White, first love and tuna lover. You can always ask them to make you a custom roll which taste so fresh. All their appetizers are also delicious. I like the monkey brain, and if you're looking for something light and refreshing; the seaweed salad is always good. Wine is greatly priced as well. It's a great date spot or just a quick bite, either way go! Wendy is our server every time and she's the best and will take care of you!"}
{"text":"The happy hour that keeps on giving should be the tagline for this place. For what feels like an happy hour that starts when the sun goes down till close it was a great place to go and get some sushi! They don't take reservations and on a Friday it was full, but the hostess gave us a pretty exact wait time and I was happy to be served once inside."}
{"text":"Been here twice and have never been disappointed with the food and service.  They had blue fin special today. So there is always something different going on."}
{"text":"They have really worked out the kinks and stepped up their game since opening. I've paid them a few visits and am happier each time. Good job guys on the basically All Day Happy Hour pricing. 2 adults had 4 rolls and 2 alcoholic drinks for a grand total of only $34! Rolls are tasty"}
{"text":"Where do I begin!  Atmosphere, food, service, and price. Atmosphere:  This place is uncomfortably loud.  The design of the place amplifies sound.  You'll have to talk loud just to have a conversation with the people you can with.  It  sounds like people yelling.  Truly, truly uncomfortable.  Food:  The sushi was actually pretty good.  Now, considering I'm from NY and am used to sushi from NY as well as San Diego, to me, the sushi was ok.  If all I've ever had was inland sushi, it would probably be delicious.  Service:  Our waitress was excellent.  She was attentive without being overbearing.  Price:  The food was priced really well.  Considering we ate at 7pm, some of what we ordered fell under the happy hour menu, which was discounted.  Overall, I had to knock some serious points (stars) for the noise.  It was frustrating.  Any introvert will be turned off from this place because of that."}
{"text":"I've always shyed away from sushi, the thought made me shrug but it I took my friend out for her birthday and off we went... The atmosphere was fun and light but it was packed upon arrival. They have reverse happy hour which is light on the pocket book too. I took one bight of my fried Philly roll and instantly I was hooked.. My friend had a rainbow roll which looked interesting but not yet inviting enough for my virgin taste buds..overall the meal was great, our server not so much. This overall experience was a great one and now there's this..my name is Erin and I am a sushiholic"}
{"text":"Best sushi place ever! The vibes are amazing and the food is ALWAYS on point. On Friday or Saturday there is typically a 30 minute wait so call ahead and reserve a spot"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot to go to! Really amazing pricing and it's hard to beat the quality. I love their Botox mania cocktail too. Happy hour specials are great and I love that they've expanded their space to accommodate more people. It can get a bit crowded, but the service is always great."}
{"text":"This is a strong sushi spot. Happy hour goes all day pretty much with good variety in rolls, apps and drinks. It's not the BEST sushi I've ever had, but it's solid and i had no qualms over quality.  Will certainly return again."}
{"text":"Sushiholic was busy on a Saturday night! I live in the neighborhood and have been wanting to try this place for a while. I wasn't disappointed. We called ahead, walked over when it was time and had a great, fresh sushi experience. The tuna sashimi was outstanding as was the evil, but the fried rice blew me away! My only issue was with the mochi.. some flavors were delicious and a couple of them were not. Regardless, the service was efficient and the Olympics were on! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Quick service great sushi and you must try their shrimp shumai"}
{"text":"Sushi is probably the most vulnerable restaurant offering. Great happy hour prices on sushi; appetizers \"meh\", and edamame not snappy. The cleanliness plus friendly service do deserve a revisit."}
{"text":"Great new spot in the neighborhood!  Sushi is really good, but it is even better considering the price.  Happy Hour is from 3 - 7... then fires back up from 8 - close.  Sushi was great and the staff was very eager to help and give great service.    Five Stars because they are really good at what they are.  Sure, I have had better sushi in a much finer restaurant, but that's not what they do here.  They have good food at a good price and so far are doing it well."}
{"text":"Vanessa, our waitress was super friendly  and very knowledgeable of the menu. This place is AMAZING!  I'm so glad we finally tried this place out  definitely coming back! clean, fun and delicious!"}
{"text":"SushiHolic ADDICT I am!!  Simply delicious & the staff are sweet (they get to know you by name)!    They had a special of live raw shrimp that was beautifully prepared & soooooo sweet!!  Made me JUMP when they pre-showed me the shrimp when it moved within the water lol. Ohhhhhh oooooops was yummy!  Freshly made ceviche SPECIAL (will depend on freshness & availability). Only made by Chef Felipe & not on menu but should be!!  OMG YUMMINESS & freakin' delish!!!  Tempura udon has a great broth & actually all their dishes have great sauces. Squid & the cucumber salad were both very nice!  Galbi & their fried rice reminded me of my mom's!!  They have awesome lunch specials!!  Great happy hour pricing & slightly different reverse happy hour pricing right after HH til closing.   Also, they will accommodate special requests: like extra spicy mmmmmmmmmm.    One of my new faves & Asian craving within walking distance!!  Woohoo!!  FYI: They do have their liquor license-from prior reviews/tips."}
{"text":"I've been here on three occasions. If the review were based on the first two I would have given them 5 stars. The last time I was there the waiter seemed overwhelmed and had a hard time keeping track of our order. We ordered saki bombs and he brought a beer without asking what kind we wanted. Don't get me wrong, the sushi is great. It's hard to find good sushi. This is definitely the place you want to check out. The reverse happy hour is reasonably priced and makes for a good date. But it can get a bit loud on weekend nights."}
{"text":"I ordered the monkey brains as an appetizer, they were Delicious! I also ordered the Bento Holic-pick one of each three items served with miso soup and salad for $9.25, my pick was the chicken teriyaki, with spicy tuna rolls, seaweed salad served with miso and salad. This was a meal for one but two or three can eat from this selection... A very nice place, and restrooms are spotless! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The sushi is good and the happy hour prices are even better. My first visit to sushiholic was great, however my second visit, not so much. I was seated at the bar and when the sushi came out, I was given the wrong rolls, which was not that big of a deal since it was a little busy. However, it took about 20 minutes for them to make the correct rolls and that was after I had to flag down my server to remind him to put my order in. Which meant I waited almost 45 minutes for my food upon placing my order. AND when they finally brought my rolls out there was a hair inside of my philly roll. :( While the taste of the food and the prices are great, I don't know if I would consider going back."}
{"text":"The food has been consistently good with decent prices, especially during their happy and reverse-happy hours. Atmosphere was great and the staff even better."}
{"text":"The food is definitely five stars I'm a stickler for fresh sushi which came out in a timely manner from the sushi bar. The only reason I didn't give it five stars on this visit was our waiter. He may have been new or maybe it was a misunderstanding with the hostess ...I'm not sure but the service left a little to be desired. Upon saying that I will definitely be back to give the service another chance and to enjoy their very tasty sushi menu!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch! Great deals on really fresh sushi.  When my little sister and I came here for lunch we ordered off their lunch specials and split the bill, $10 each not including tip, not bad for sushi and a bowl of soup."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once for dinner and once for happy hour. The ambiance is great. It's sort of dim lighting with modern asian decor, clean lines, and top 40 tunes. I appreciate that the music is not blaring, but you can hear it and still have a conversation. There is a nice selection of seating and the wait staff is friendly and helpful. The food is very, very good with a reasonable price. The happy pricing is very good. I've basically had sushi and edamame here, and I've been very happy with everything I've ordered. Fresh food, clean restaurant, and happy servers. It's all around great. PS...bathrooms (2 of them) are unisex with a changing table in each so ladies you can send your man to do the diaper change :)"}
{"text":"One of my go-to sushi spots in Phoenix. They have happy hour then reverse happy hour directly following. So anytime from 2pm-12am you're pretty much set!  They have a variety of sushi items and they'll be sure to make your taste buds happy :).   They don't have an insane amount of drinks but you should be able to find something you enjoy. I will suggest getting the crab puffs for an appetizer. I get these EVERY time!  The dipping sauce compliments them perfectly. My favorite sushi would be the tootsie roll or sweet thang. Give this play a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The info on here says they take reservations... the girl answering the phone says they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. After making reservations hours ahead of time for a party of 9 for a special occasion I was told upon arrival that they have never taken reservations and that it would be approximately an hour wait.... with all of that clusterf $@* out of the way, the gentleman at the front desk apologized several times and assured us that our reservation would be upheld as soon as they could clear the space. Our party headed next door to grab a drink while we waited and when our table was made available the gentleman at the front desk took time to personally track us down to ensure that we made it to our table. Very very pleased with the service and how they turned a potentially bad experience into an awesome evening."}
{"text":"I ADORE this place... the staff /chefs are the best... I have tried many of their items and go weekly... super duper fresh & very consistent... best rolls in town, & very original options... the Hamachi Make is delish as well... I recommend it all the time.  My 8 yr old daughter also luvs it."}
{"text":"The sushi is amazing! They have brought back the art of sushi to the valley! Thank you Sushiholic!!"}
{"text":"I went to Sushiholic Monday night (8pm). A coworker had suggested it weeks before I went. I happened to be in the area and was starving so I stopped in. I ordered the \"Booty Booty Roll\". It was amazing. The wait was roughly 10 minutes, as I ordered my food to go. The restaurant was pretty small, dimly lit, cozy place. I will go back to try other sushi rolls."}
{"text":"I here pretty regularly, and always have a lovely experience. The prices are gpod, the service is great, and the sushi is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Came for reverse happy hour for the first time and found this place to be amazing! Nice location and food was delicious and affordable. We had the shrimp tempura crispy roll and also the Las Vegas roll with shrimp fried rice!"}
{"text":"Guilty pleasure roll is so good.  Prices were reasonable.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Great lunch menu with lots of sushi options at very reasonable prices. Service was punctual and friendly. I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great sushi! We did a $40.00 deal for two and it was great. No skimping on portions! I think the waiting area is small and the wait time they gave us was reduced by people waiting outside leaving. Very nice atmosphere but very loud!"}
{"text":"Great place. Sushi is fresh and tasty. Service is outstanding and the prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"Excited I found this sushi spot and even happier its in the Arcadia area! They really do have some great deals during their happy hour (and even reverse HH). This is a newer place, so they are still trying to get their serving responsibilities together so keep that in mind - but the servers are extremely nice. I love their sushi, sashimi, the menu is fabulous. The sake bombs are a great deal as well!   This will definitely be one of my favorites, I can already tell. The portions are well worth it and the design is so appealing you can't stop eating!"}
{"text":"I tried Sushiholic on a Thursday night, sat at the bar for dinner with a coworker. The restaurant was somewhat busy, though not unmanageable. We were seated with several menus, but decided to split a sashimi platter for two from the regular menu, foregoing the somewhat-intriguing happy hour drinks and specials. After 35 minutes of sipping on water, our sashimi platter arrived. It seemed like a pretty packed house, so we weren't troubled by the significant wait for our food. Though, in retrospect, the only preparation involved in a sashimi platter is cutting the fish....hmmm. We took our time devouring our dish; I even ordered a separate dinner to-go. An hour or so later our server meandered by, we asked for our checks, and inquired why we didn't get the soup and salad that came with our meal--according to the menu. She told us our platter didn't come with soup/salad, but she'd double-check to be sure. A few minutes later, she approached us and said that yes, our order did come with a soup and salad for each person and asked us if we wanted them. We politely declined--we had already signed our checks and were ready to leave. We left without any offer for a partial refund, restaurant credit, or slight acknowledgement of the establishment's mistake beyond serving us soup as we're ready to leave.  The overall service was a level below mediocre, considering the soup and salad screw-up while taking into account the degree of attentiveness we received (which wasn't anything beyond acceptable). A couple of the sashimi cuts were surprisingly delicious and fresh, and the rest were meh. I just simply do not understand how an establishment justifies charging me full price for a meal I received only a fraction of. I'm not impressed with Sushiholic, which truly saddens me, due to its close proximity to my home and my proclivity to make it rain when I'm drunk on sake and sushi. I suppose it's a loss for both of us, Sushiholic."}
{"text":"Nice quiet atmosphere. Fast service. Yummy sushi. Even had sea urchin... I would eat here again:)"}
{"text":"Great prices for happy hour.  It's so tasty!  Eat in is always fun and has an urban vibe.  Takeout is nicely displayed and easy to complete order and pay.  Soooo yummy!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a last minute spot for dinner, and I remembered passing by this place. I wish I came here sooner. Their sushi is so delicious and fresh, and their prices are very reasonable. I happened to show up right on time for happy hour, and mostly everything was within 5-6 dollars.  There is an extensive amount of appetizers and rolls to choose from. Even the regularly priced items were well priced.  The staff was also very friendly and welcoming. The establishment was small but you felt very comfortable. I can not wait to bring my friends and family. Definitely my new sushi spot."}
{"text":"Wouldn't know how the food was. My Girlfriend and I walked in and saw the \"Please Wait to be Seated\" sign with no one at the front. So we wait...and wait...and wait. 5 minutes goes by...then 7. At this point other customers were starting to stare. I made eye contact with wait staff members, but they gave no sign of acknowledgment towards us. A simple \"we'll be right with you ladies\" would have been nice at least. We finally just walked out at 15 minutes. Not sure what the disconnect was, but it certainly was not a busy night. There were several open tables as well seats at the bar. Sad."}
{"text":"Sushiholic expanded the restaurant by taking over the former Baskin Robbins location next door.  There is now plenty of room (it's still crowded but in a good way) and the service did not suffer as a result of the larger space..."}
{"text":"MUST READ!!! I needed to place a huge lunch order for pick up for my office. The website doesn't show their menu so I called in to see if they could email me a menu or send me a picture of the menu. The receptionist told me she can't email the menu because they don't have an email so I asked her to take a picture of the menu and send it in a text. She said \" I have tried that before and it won't go through and you might not be able to read it\" I am like ok... It's 2018 and everyone has smart phones, it takes 30 seconds to send a photo. She then told me I was being rude and it's not her job to get me the menu. I then asked to speak with someone else because she clearly was offended I wanted to give her employer business! The next woman I spoke to said \"sorry we can't send you the menu because we can't be on our phones while working, they are locked up\" she then told me to try their yelp page for pictures of the food that customers have posted. So I am suppose to order lunch for 15+ people using only photos people have posted? I am sure their boss would have wanted them to send me the menu because they just lost out on a $400+ order AND our office is across the street from their location. We wont be going there for lunch ever again. Worst customer service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sashimi quality is not very fresh. Don't get sweet shrimp here, not good at all. Service is good though and they have fresh wasabi."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the PHX area and if you know me, you know I love deals. I was excited to try this place out for their happy hour options.  We arrived in time for their reverse happy hour and was served quickly. The waitress took our orders and the food came out really fast which was great. No one wants to be around a hangry Casey.  I had the miso soup, seaweed salad, shrimp shu mai and one of their rolls.  Miso soup - okay - nothing special Seaweed salad - okay - nothing special Shrimp shu mai - terrible - don't order this, it tasted doughy and didn't have very much flavor at all. It's like a wannabe har gow (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Har_gow) but terrible. Sushi roll - I can't remember the name of it because it was that good. (insert sarcasm)  With so many options around - I wouldn't come back unless someone in the group says it's their last meal and they have to go there. JK..."}
{"text":"We're from out of town and staying at the Biltmore. We were in the mood for sushi and after reading the reviews decided to try it. We happened to be there for happy hour and it was great! We tried the Tokyo Tea for a cocktail but they had a lot of beers to try as well. We ordered the tempura calamari and cucumber salad to start. Both were fresh and tasty. We ordered three different rolls and loved them all. The yellowtail was delicious as were the California roll. Our server was fantastic as well. Really I can't imagine a bad choice. This place would become a habit if we lived here!"}
{"text":"I was being optimistic and came here tonight for dinner and I'm glad I did! Julie was our server and was super nice to us! Our saki was huge and worth the price! Made us three drinks and the Vegas rolls were delicious def coming back I like there happy hour its key to success!"}
{"text":"Great food! Reverse happy hour! Open til midnight! That combination is hard to beat..."}
{"text":"I was first a little nervous about trying this sushi place. It looks like it's in the hood but it's actually really nice and clean in the inside. Can't judge a book by its cover :) I ordered the climax roll and it was really good. Service was decent. I wouldn't get the Las Vegas roll here though it was the worst I've ever heard. It taste like pure warm mush. Ended our dinner with the fried green ice cream and that was pretty amazing."}
{"text":"WOW.  REALLY GOOD, CLEAN AND WELL PUT TOGETHER SUSHI.  The Uni tastes like it just came out of the sea, and believe me I know.  Ive eaten all Over the country.  Salmon skin handroll his deliciously made. This is not like the usual sushi places you think you like.  This is good quality sushi if you know sushi.  The staff is very inviting.  To a lesser extent,  the bathrooms are the cleanest I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Been there numerous times.  The first 3 times I was there, I literally sat there for about 7-10 minutes without being greeted.  By the third time, you get a little snippy, you know what I mean?  You start asking yourself, why do you keep coming back.  Well, it was going to be my last time the following time, and ever since that has never been a problem.  The sushi is great.  The people are friendly.  They always back to back happy hour, so if you miss one, you are saved by the following!  I'm always surprised when I get the bill though because it comes to like 35 dollars and it's happy hour!  But I can only blame myself, this guys a ravenous beast!  :)"}
{"text":"Best tasting sushi in the valley with great prices! The actual cocktail list is a rip off $9 for the smallest drink, Not worth the money, stick with saki! Very clean and pretty fast for a busy Saturday night, expect a wait small environment but worth the wait. They also have an excellent children's menu, my daughter loved the yakisoba chicken and veggies it was delicious. They also have a couple tv's with the football game on, Always a plus."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. We found this place when it first opened, it was very quiet, but it hasn't been since. Their happy hour is a great price and the sushi is great. It's always busy but worth the wait. I always recommend sushiholic for people who love sushi."}
{"text":"One word - AMAZING!!! By far the best sushi ever!  SEP (our waiter) took GREAT care of us, made recommendations and was spot-on!  This is my new sushi home!  Loved everything from the sushi to the service!  I have to say, better than NOBU in CA!  Again, seriously, stop and you'll be hooked!  Thanks SEP for being, kind, observant, knowing the food and making our first experience here a hit!  We will now be regulars!  5+++ stars!"}
{"text":"First visit today some of freshest sushi ive had, great atmosphere and very good service!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh they should have one in Seattle Washington not many restaurants of that kind."}
{"text":"This is a favorite spot for myself and the hubs. The sushi is always fresh and the Kirin is cold. They have a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places in central Phoenix for the price. The food is always fresh and there is always a happy hour. The spicy tuna roll is one of the best I have had."}
{"text":"OH.MY.GOD!!! This place is ahhhhmazing. I honestly don't know what we ordered because we just took the recommendations from our AWESOME server Sep! Seriously top notch service, some of the best I've ever had. Do NOT skip this spot and make sure you request Sep. this place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great sushi at incredibly reasonable prices. You can get a Philly roll anywhere, but this one in particular was fantastic. There are so many different rolls to choose from with pictures and descriptions of what's inside, which is helpful to those who don't know sushi very well. The hostess and server who took my order were very nice and pleasant. I only ordered takeout but would definitely come back to dine. I was very happy with the three rolls I ordered."}
{"text":"Based on the Yelp reviews, I decided to try Sushiholic.  The happy hour specials are great!  The spicy tuna had a frozen taste to it but everything else was decent."}
{"text":"The best part about this place is that there's only 1 hour of the day thats not happy hour. The fish is always fresh, menu has a lot of options. Due to proximity it was uncontested as our go to spot for some sush-a-loosh."}
{"text":"Quality sushi.  Fantastic staff and they are fast and efficient   Try this place it's in a strip mall but god crowd!! Addicted"}
{"text":"Pretty good but nothing spectacular. Was given the wrong type of tuna sashimi. And overall the appearance of the restaurant is nothing special. However they do have a good happy hour and it was pretty quick to stop in. The crispy shrimp roll in the back of the photo was my favorite. But I have had better sushi elsewhere"}
{"text":"Glad to have a decent sushi restaurant in Arcadia area. We drive to downtown or Scottsdale normally because Stingray, Delux, sushi station etc. just don't do it for us.   Went last night for dinner and was pretty happy. Good sushi, conveniently located, and friendly staff. Their happy hour right now is everyday which is awesome! Excited for the good addition and hope it stays as consistent for when we want casual, close by sushi."}
{"text":"The place to stop when you are starving!  Fresh and delicious with a great happy hour that starts at 2pm. Sepehr was the waiter. Sweet, polite, prompt, perfect!  Spicy tuna...always my favorite. This time I tried the potato wrapped shrimp too ( I know, not the healthiest, but yum!  Comfort food!)"}
{"text":"I will have to say this is one of the best sushi places I have ever been. The sushi was so perfect and it was so fresh just melted in your mouth. They have a wonderful prices a great happy hour it's just a perfect neighborhood gem ..."}
{"text":"Sushiholic is great. I started going when it first opened a few years ago and have been very happy each time. With a great menu, awesome sushi, friendly staff and a convenient location you need to come here asap. Not to mention they made the HAPPY HOUR all day so you can always get amazing deals.   They also just opened up a second half of the restaurant, taking over the neighboring building, so it looks a lot more open and you probably don't have to wait long."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darned good!  A friend I was with wanted sushi, so we stopped in at 830pm on a Friday night.  There was a 25 minute wait, so I'm thinking the crowds are on to something.  I noticed a sign outside that had their happy hour times noted... Everyday from 3-8pm, and then reverse hh from 8pm to close!  Had only a couple rolls, but will be back soon to try more options!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday, they have awesome sushi and if you happen to get Vanessa for your waitress she is beyond amazing! She is on top of her game. A PLUS service! Very cozy atmosphere and a great happy hour. We come here often. But just had to give a shout out to Vanessa because she rocked it and management wasn't there for me to sing my praise about her!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi!! Cuts of sashimi were a very nice size, excellent grade and served at the perfect temperature.  Rolls were nice it too much rice.  Very flavorful.     Love this place"}
{"text":"We love this place! Good service, amazing happy hour, decent sushi. The restaurant is usually busy but we hardly ever wait. I love that we can be in and out in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for dinner on a Friday night and soooo glad we got out of our little bubble! I had visited for lunch a few weeks ago and it was very good! We got there a little after 8pm and it was reverse happy hour. We ended up getting several rolls to share and it was awesome! Service was very good and we cannot wait to go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the lunch bento special today.  The quanitity and quality of the food was excellent, and it costed $9!  Plus the service when you sit at the bar is amazing.  Going back here a lot!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to great nigiri sushi but maybe I have been spoiled in LA. The sushi was ok; not fantastic and not terrible. Service was great and the sushi chef was very nice. If you are looking for interesting rolls, this is the spot to try as they do have some very interesting rolls on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, good atmosphere and prices. Their bluefin special with fresh wasabi was a revelation. I want to come back here again very soon. Thanks for a great meal! Oh and it's kid friendly!"}
{"text":"I love the food here, there are many choices for Japanese food, not just sushi. My only complaint is that the service is spotty. Sometimes good, sometimes bad."}
{"text":"Probably spoiled by the many options in Los Angeles, I can only say this place is just average.   Had mostly their happy hour special tonight.   Uni, Salmon and Yellowtail nigiri Too much rice.  Fish is par at best.   Spicy tuna roll Got enough kick. I like it.   Rainbow roll Meh. The fishes on top of the California roll is not top quality.   And they are still waiting for the liquor license.   For happy hour, no alcohol, one person still cost me $30?!  For the same price, I have 3-4 AYCE places I can think of that serves better quality fish with a lot less rice to fill you up.  Will probably wait a while before returning again."}
{"text":"A great location off camelback and Reverse happy hour with sushi until midnight! This is one of my favorite places to get real food after a long late day. The sake is always cold (unless you like it hot) and delicious. Always a chill atmosphere and smooth tunes."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Arizona for the month of February on our year long trip around the US. While in Phoenix, we needed a place within walking distance from our apartment, and we found the amazing reverse happy hour here! We had a long day at the Strong Beer Festival, and were HUNGRY. We ordered what we knew was going to be too much to eat and super expensive, but we were pleasantly surprised to walk out of there with a $50 bill! If you order from the Happy Hour menu, you will get a great deal on many different items!  I actually just wrote about our experience here in my blog post about the Food and Fun in Arizona: https://tandaintheusofa.com/2017/03/16/food-and-fun-in-arizona/"}
{"text":"Went here last week and absolutely LOVED this place! The \"amigo\" speciality sushi was amazing if you love spicier sushi. They have a wide variety of different sushis which is great, we can't wait to try more next time! The side salad is only 2 bucks and it's absolutely delicious and a perfect size to start! The ambiance is cool and modern, but still gives a relaxed feel. We had the green tea mochi ice cream for dessert which was delicious with a beautiful presentation! The servers are very nice and are always smiling!:) so happy to find this new place and we can't wait to go back soon! Definitely going to become one of our sushi places!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp to grab some food before flying out back to California. So happy we stopped here. They have a great selection of rolls and excellent customer service! Sepehr was above and beyond when it comes to friendly and courteous service. He was even working the floor alone and we didn't notice because he was so attentive. Great service + great food =great times"}
{"text":"What a great place! Have eaten here several times and always enjoyed ourselves.  Nothing fancy in terms of decor...modern, informal vibe. Excellent service and fairly prompt given that it is sushi.  Have had a number of the sushi rolls all very fresh and tasty! The spicy tuna roll is a favorite of ours. The rolls are good sized and have less rice than other places.  Good pricing, not cheap but more than fair for good sushi.   A must try!"}
{"text":"Looking for some good sushi in Arizona, Phoenix, this was a great spot.  The sushi was fresh and they have great customer service.  They have early happy hour which is great.  uni, hamachi, tuna was very good and recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour. When we got here the place was extremely busy. There was two of us and the wait was about 15 minutes but that 15 minute went by pretty quick. Their sushi is great and so is the price! I recommend this place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Decent quality (albeit basic) rolls/good for a random strip mall in Arcadia. I wouldn't order any extensive sashimi order and I'm not sure about the appetizer (non-sushi) menu, but beer/sake is cheap! Good for groups or a casual date because at usually busy and not super quiet. Happy hour is 2pm-close...so basically all day."}
{"text":"Love it! Great service, great prices.  A friend and I had sake, gyoza, three rolls, miso soup and desert for about $40.  And don't hesitate to check out the rest of the menu! Their udon is legit."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Lady Gaga - Paparazzi)  We are the crowd We're Yelping out Got my star on it's true Need that picture of food It's so magical We'd be so fantastical  Sushi and drinks Sake Daiginjo Not sure what it means But this photo from us It don't have a price Ready for those sashimi Cause you know that baby I  I'm your biggest fan I'll Bo Bites you until you love me Sushi-Sushiholic Baby theres only four to five superstars That I can give you Sushi-Sushiholic   Sushiholic is the same owner as Sushi Style up on the North side of town.  Overall, I like the layout and ambiance of the place.  Hip and modern with beating music as you can hear the crowd chit and chatter!  I came here with my friend and we sat at the bar.  We ordered a bottle of sake to start our night.  For our appetizers we ordered the Okra & Potato wrapped Shrimp.  The okra was doused with a gooey sesame seed oil and nutty sauce.  It was light and didn't have the texture I expected.  It was similar to eating the stinky beans.  As for the shrimp; it was crunchy   since it was fried with the potato wrappings.  We just dipped those in sweet and sour sauce.  For our entree we ordered the First Love Roll, Cherry Blossom Roll, and the Salmon Nigiri with Kiwi.  The First Love was a California Roll topped with Tuna & Salmon and drizzled with eel sauce, spicy mayo, and creamy wasabi.  The Cherry Blossom was a double roll; salmon and avocado wrapped with tuna and eel sauce.  My favorite bite of the night was the salmon nigiri served with kiwi in a ponzu like sauce.  It was served in a large eating spoon so the appearance was very welcoming.    In the end, Sushiholic is a nice sushi spot for the Arcadia area.  The place was popping when we arrived and service was attentive and fun.  My recommendation is approved! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had lunch there.  Rolls are solid for the price.  The specialty roll was obviously way better.  They are quick even though they get busy for lunch."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Sushiholic on a Saturday night for happy hour. They do not have a liquor license yet so this was only for the food. I am very particular about sushi restaurants.. I can say this would be my top 3. It is cheap, tasty, and they have great customer service. I loved the spicy tuna sushi, although did not like the Vegas roll. They are not stingy when it comes to the fish in the sushi. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My daughter took me here today for lunch for Mother's Day, since we knew tomorrow would be crazy busy.   We both had the sushi combo, which comes with a wide assortment of nigiri and spicy tuna and California rolls.     The fish is fresh.   And I mean fresh.   No limp or smell here.  I would say I loved all of it except for the California roll.   I must admit, I am REALLY NOT a fan of the California roll.   I wonder if I would have been able to exchange that for something else.  I like what they did with the rice. It is moist without being mushy. A lot of times the sushi rice is dry. I wonder if they use all sushi rice as opposed to maybe half sushi rice and half short grain rice, which is what I use.    The meal does come with miso soup and green salad.   The salad dressing was a tiny bit too tart for my taste, but not worth thinking it wasn't good.  Yes, I would definitely come here again.  I really wanted to try one of their bentos."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good!! Went for the reverse happy hour and got a few rolls off that; spicy tuna, spicy salmon and las vegas roll, which was bomb! We love the shishito peppers! We also ordered edaname but wasn't too crazy about it, ive had better elsewhere. My only problem was That our server, forgot his name HOVERED over my guest and I during payment, especially when I was trying to leave a tip. I work in the restaurant industry myself and I know better than that. It felt very uneasy and uncomfortable and afterwards started chit-chatting with a coworker looking at our table.. Not appropriate, not sure if I'll be back because of that."}
{"text":"This restaurant and customer service is first class! I brought a client of mine here only because I had been here before and it was amazing. Twice we had the pleasure of having same server. Her name is Sedona's she is super pleasant and has a great personality and is very knowledgeable about the menu. This restaurant has a great atmosphere....I do think I will make this a weekly luncheon spot."}
{"text":"This place is always so good. This time they didn't even get my order right. I didn't even say anything but it's annoying. The server wasn't even busy... I guess just an off night. Usually on point."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here one late night for reverse happy hour and it did not disappoint! Food was excellent, service was great and you can't beat the prices. Will be coming here a lot !!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night.  Sushi was very good, had yellowtail sashimi, crunchy spicy tuna roll and salmon sushi.  All were very good, service was good, not great.  They are still pretty new and finding their way.  Definitely going back on my next Phoenix trip."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Great atmosphere and prices, BUT I got food poisoning one time. We got a couple pieces of sashimi we didn't order, and me, being the glutinous person that I am decided to eat them anyway. They were a bit warm and didn't taste quite right... long story short got sick all night and had to call off work the next day.   Aside that one time experience, I really enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"I have been driving by this restaurant for awhile and have been meaning to try it out. As many of the other reviews said the sushi is excellent, large portion sizes and very reasonable prices. It's great to have a place like this in the neighborhood. A fun vibe in the restaurant too!  Happy Hour and Reverse Happy Hour specials make it even better!!  The garlic edamame was yummy.   We will be back there again soon! (Just a reminder that they are closed on Sunday)."}
{"text":"The food is so delicious! I haven't tried anything I don't like! Great experience every time we come in... you gotta try the shrimp tempura and Vegas rolls.... so good! The staff are all super friendly. Samantha is who we get the most- she's a workhorse always hustling around to make sure everyone is getting everything they need!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT for lunch and ok for dinner. The sushi rolls, while good, are a little on the smaller size.  However, the lunch bento box is a great deal and very filling. I was very impressed. I will stick to going there at lunch!"}
{"text":"Sushiholic is definitely a nice addition to my 'hood.  I'd pretty much given up on finding decent sushi in our landlocked state until a few recent finds, Sushiholic being one of them.  This place offers decent quality fish / seafood, lots of selection, moderate prices, and a comfortable, casual environment.  Their location is convenient for me and has plenty of parking as well.  Some of my recommendations are: -Crispy Spicy Tuna -Alaskan Roll -Sunset Roll -Salmon sashimi -Ikura  And if you're not feeling like going the raw route, go for edamame + the fried rice!  All of that being said, a few things to avoid that I didn't love: seaweed salad, scallops.  Hoping that when I had these things it was an off night?  Note that Sushiholic is closed on Sundays.  Also, if you go at prime time any other day, you may have a short wait.  Calling ahead for pick-up is a great option although I've attempted that a few times and no one has answered the phone."}
{"text":"Yeah love happy hour menu.  Great place attentive servers and friendly staff.  Everything is turnkey and  quickly served.  Not a place to stay hang out for 1-2 hour dinner.  Clean very good restaurant.  The sushi is great and fresh.  The staff looked yo be well treated and having fun the entire fast paced time.  I ordered the sushiholic which was plenty food hungry with a hot sake.  Great combo.  Check out my pics!"}
{"text":"Fish was fresh and clean. Portion was so so. Price was decent for sushi. As expected for a place with no japanese sushi chefs.   Nice blue lighting and decor was not phenomenal, but it was decent. It's very loud if you are looking to talk over dinner, make sure to speak in louder volumes."}
{"text":"Hands down.. the best sushi spot around! My girlfriend and I have frequented this amazing spot many times. Im just now getting to the review.  Lets start with ..yes people have caught onto how great this place is.. so expect a wait. However, its worth it.  Happy hour deals all the time.. but dont let that stop you from ordering some of the other amazing items on the menu. The sushi chefs are very friendly and that is a plus. We've sat at the bar a few times.  I also have to compliment the servers. We have had all good experiences..worst thing was we had to ask which roll was which..now that may be nitpicking, but if i order new rolls i like to know whats what.   We will definitely be back. Great prices and good service is why we will continue to give you business. Please dont change that"}
{"text":"I have never written a bad review in my life, but I guess there's a first for everything.   My family from Mexico are visiting and today is my aunt's birthday. She decided on this restaurant & we all went. We called before and they informed us that they did not make reservations, to just come in and they would figure it out. My large party of 30 went inside and as we waited for seating, they informed us that we could not be accepted as customers unless we spent a minimum of $2,000.  We drove 30 minutes to get here, just to be told this.  The fact that they said that over the phone & then informed us they would not accept us unless we paid that ridiculous amount is extremely unprofessional.   We will never return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I Havre been there 3x First time i order out and got charged full price which i was not told.  I thought i would get the happy hour price if i order in person and durning happy hour time, but i was wrong , its only for dine in only in order to get  the happy hour price. 2nd time i dine in, sat at the bar and waited like 15 minutes to get any service, get the menu. I started talking to the hispanics making the sushi in ordwr to fill up the time till the waitress came by to take my drink order. I order a sake bomber and Karin beer and then had to wait which seemed like forever to get my order in. Finally put my order in of las vegas rolls and asked for ice water with lemon...i got my water but had to ask several times for lemons from 3 different waitress to get my lemon for water. The atmosphere is great,  price are great, if u dine in.  the cooks are awesome but if your in a hurry forget it...you will be thete for over an hour or so."}
{"text":"Literally happy hour all night long. Sushi was pretty good. Miso Soup for only $1! If your craving sushi, stop here!"}
{"text":"I read some reviews here and gave it a try. We have been twice. She place is nice, the service super, the food great and prices very affordable.  Try it you will not regret."}
{"text":"Service was great!  Miso soup wasn't watered down. Best happy hour choices in town. Gyoza was hot and crispy. Food comes out fast too. New favorite sushi spot."}
{"text":"Great sushi, very reasonable prices and very friendly staff. Just an FYI happy hour starts at 3pm not 2pm which is written on their website"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Sushiholic last night. I was happy about the fact that it's pretty close to my house and the fact that they had a happy hour that lasted until 8pm...I had a girlfriend coming into town and thought we would get there before 8 but didn't...  Pro's Imagine my surprise when I looked at the menu to see it was reverse happy hour every night from 8pm until close!!! Friendly staff  Didn't have to wait a long time for our food...which generally you do at sushi restaurants Water cup always full...Thanks Sushiholic...this is a real issue at most sushi restaurants Great happy hour menu with lots of options  Con's We got to the restaurant and there was about 4 different parties waiting...but the Sushi bar had at least 6 seats that no one was sitting in. When I stepped up to give my name to the hostess I asked if the sushi bar seats were open seating and she said no... Happy hour rolls seem to be about 1/2 the size of a regular roll that I have had at any other sushi restaurant in my life...So I guess that's all the sizzle about the happy hour pricing  Overall Sushiholic get's 3 stars for being A-Ok"}
{"text":"Sat at the sushi bar and had a nice experience! Excellent happy hour prices and quick efficient service, great addition to the Arcadia area!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi in Phoenix? Decide for yourself if you dare!"}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour and the choices were pretty extensive, but it was really just basic sushi.  We started with a calamari tempura and it's not the usual rounded pieces. It's good but just heavily breaded. I got the crunchy roll sushi for my main dish. It was good for the happy hour price, but it wasn't anything amazing. My dad got the tonkotsu ramen and it was decent but not as good as the real stuff. Maybe I'm just spoiled from the excellent ramen/sushi places in southern California. After all, we have it good as we live right next to the Pacific Ocean and everything is made really fresh. My mom got the katsudon chicken and it only had small pieces of meat and tons of rice. Overall it was meh.  We had a really friendly server. She's the only reason why this supposedly 1 star review has 2. Definitely not coming back, but good enough for Phoenix, I guess."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. The miso soup is so delicious and hot the spot. The reverse happy hour has some great deals. We always get large hot sake for $5 each. The Vegas roll is the best bang for your buck on the HH. The best roll that's on their main menu is the baked lobster roll. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place honestly has great quality sushi with lots of great happy hour prices. The reason why I am only giving a 3 star is because Heather has a very nasty attitude. She forgets to bring some of my orders and throughout my experience there she never comes and checks on me. I confronted her about it and later when she passes by she made a comment about my appearance and walked away. I am honestly not mad at all giving that the sushi chefs are some of the nicest chefs. They make sure that your order is right."}
{"text":"This place is great. Its not fancy, it s not expensive its not an authentic Shushi house atmosphere. It is a cool down to earth fun environment with great sushi and great service.  MASA the owner has done what I have been wishing every sushi restaurant would do, hire great Sushi chefs with wonderful good looking American speaking waitresses.  In addition, he took the forgotten old school paper ordering checklist and laminated it and gives you a marker to check off what you want and better yet flip it over and write what you want.  Hand it to the waitress and enjoy your evening with your dinner mates. Great job Masa!  For the rest of you nay sayers, get over it, sometimes places are very busy and there is a price to success when you are not overcharging your customers. This is a place to go, get some SAKE,  chill out and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Sushiholic is for real. This place has really good fucking sushi and has put much shame on other sushi related establishments in the Phoenix area. They don't do reservations, and their website is a bit dated, but who the fuck cares? It's all about the sushi, and that's what really matters."}
{"text":"Great spot, tremendous happy hour. Love sitting at the bar regularly, the sushi chef's are great guys to chat with, service is typically pretty solid, even when it's busy they do a great job.  Quality sushi, you get good value for what you pay!"}
{"text":"I work at an incredible sushi restaurant, and I can tell you this is very poor quality sushi. What sushi place PRE CUTS their fish!!!!!!!  And beware of their super white tuna!  Sometimes it's under the name \"butterfish,\" \"oilfish,\" or \"waloo/walu.\" Sushi restaurants occasionally serve it as \"super white tuna\" or \"king tuna\", and it's actually Escolar. It's a very cheap fish!   Escolar is a type of snake mackerel that cannot metabolize the wax esters naturally found in its diet. These esters are called gempylotoxin, and are very similar to castor or mineral oil. This is what gives the flesh of escolar its oily texture. As a result, when full portions of escolar are consumed, these wax esters cause gastrointestinal symptoms."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place  in Phoenix!! We drive from west valley for this place! Happy Hour is great!"}
{"text":"Sat in the from for about eight minutes. Staff sat the guy ahead of us and never returned to seat us. Guess we'll head over to Sushi Brokers where we are greeted and sat as soon as we arrive."}
{"text":"The price is right. This place is solid sushi with a great price tag. The waiting staff is fantastic and will be back again."}
{"text":"Great food and interesting drinks. Service is good when we got in, however when we were ready for check it took 5 times to flag the waitress down. I don't think she came to check on us either."}
{"text":"I'm upping my rating of this restaurant to 5 stars.  After dining here a few dozen times I can legitimately say this is an excellent pace to eat and a rarity for Phoenix.  The food is just excellent."}
{"text":"I always order to get their fried rice and it tastes good. I have only dine in here once and experience was mediocre because food took a while and service was okay. I prefer to get to go than dining in."}
{"text":"Tried this new restaurant and I was really happy with the food and service!!! The place looks great too. I highly recommend it.   They just got their liquor license! Happy hour here I come!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great sushi! Happy to have a solid sushi spot in Arcadia now. Happy hour is great. Lots of interesting special rolls."}
{"text":"Yes, a sushi joint close to me, offers awesome happy hour, good customer service, and no long waits!!! Thanks Yelp for helping me find this place. I came here with the hubby on a Friday night and the restaurant was not busy so lucky for us! Our server gave us menus - and they had a great happy hour with many options! I was highly impressed. They even have many different cocktail drinks that also have happy hour prices!  We ordered 1 seaweed salad, 1 sweet thang roll, 1 crunchy roll, 1 spicy tuna roll and 1 sake sangria. Everything was pretty good - even the hubs liked it. My sangria was pretty strong - I am a lightweight so I took a few sips, passed the drink over to my partner and he finished it.   Total of our bill was $27.08 + tip. I am definitely coming back to this place! I want to try the other cocktails on that happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good prices. Cool design. We were surprised at how good sushiholic was! We saw it open up and finally visited the other day. The restaurant was packed but luckily we were able to sit right down. It had a nice ambiance with music and everyone talking away enjoying themselves. Our server was quick and friendly. The food came out and was very tasty and fresh. They have a really nice selection of sushi as well has entrees and udon or ramen. They also had a nice kids menu. Overall we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for AZ sushi. Nigiri was nicely formed, but the sushi rice was packed a little too tight. That's a minor grip from a picky sushi eater.   All of the rolls we had were good. The spicy tuna was a little overboard on the spicy to the point you couldn't really taste the fish so I took a star off for that. Otherwise, this was money well spent. I'll be back next time I'm craving sushi."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place. We ordered beef teriyaki noodle fish and a beef noodle dish and they were terrible. It tasted like the beef was cooked with no seasonings and then covered with teriyaki sauce. Beef was also chewy and tough ."}
{"text":"I come to Sushiholic ALL THE TIME considering its a two minute walk from my house. Sushi is good and service is ok... Now that they have their liquor license its a great happy hour spot! I was very turned off tonight when I came in and the hostess told me they don't open their patio until 6:30pm (I came at 6:16pm). She said I could get another table and move over to the patio when it opened... When I came here last week at 5:30 ish there was a table already sat on the patio and we sat there as well. It was a Thursday night. I'm confused at the business model here and how they serve their guests. I don't get what is so hard about opening a door to the patio to allow 3 additional tables to be sat. Especially when there are only 8 tables sat in the restaurant and the entire sushi bar is empty.... Interesting."}
{"text":"Really like this sushi spot. First of all the service is good and fast. Prices are excellent, especially happy hour and happy hour goes till 8pm! They have a lot of different specialty rolls to pick from and overall all the rolls tasted excellent. The only wish was that the fried rolls were warmer, both we ordered were a bit cool."}
{"text":"Great Sushi!  The service was just ok, drinks took forever to get refilled and asked for place settings twice before stealing them from another table."}
{"text":"This may be my favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix. The menu is giant and the flavors are rich. The place is on the smaller size, so be ready for a small wait on weekends. But it's very worth it!"}
{"text":"Sushiholic is an clean, fresh  and cheap(happy hour) sushi restaurant. Basically what everyone wants from a sushi restaurant. Sometimes a wait but no longer then 30 minutes. Seems to have good turn over on their tables. Some kind of special or happy hour will be going on, so no need to wait until after normal dinner hours for a cheaper sushi meal."}
{"text":"Such a great place to come for lunch.   They have multiple lunch options that are all cost effective.   My favorite are their Bento boxes - comes with- Miso soup, rice, salad, sushi roll (from select menu), side of choice (crab puffs are the best), entree of choice (Chicken or Salmon Teriyaki or the Chicken Katsu are my favorite) and a weirdo little mashed potato salad and half of an orange - all for $9.  Can we all say heck yes!   I have also had the Udon lunch special - large bowl of select udon soup with a sushi roll - I couldn't finish everything I was stuffed.   Shishito peppers are only okay - the sauce is blah that they are cooked in.   Sushi is fresh - Service is typically quick - always busy - very clean.   They have a very large sushi selection - have yet to come here for dinner but guessing I wont be dissapointed :)"}
{"text":"Wanted sushi tonight. We were deciding between sushi Roku and here. Their happy hour was longer (basically all night). It's a nice menu for sushi. Some of the better rolls are not on the happy hour menu. Service was outstanding. I highly recommend this place for good priced sushi. Enjoy!!!!!"}
{"text":"First let me say that I thought maybe our being from Las Vegas makes us somewhat spoiled where sushi is concerned because of our AYCE options. However, we have eaten sushi everywhere we've traveled & still enjoyed good, flavorful rolls. Sushiholic does offer a happy hour (several hours long) but you are limited to their happy hour menu selections, which leaves a lotto be desired. Every roll we ordered on the list was bland, no sauces, no flare or imagination. They did have another menu of specialty rolls, of which we tried a couple, but felt they also lacked the very distinct flavor variations between the rolls we get at home. Their chefs need to put more effort into bringing it up a notch to wow your tasting experience & ease off the rice a bit. If you like California rolls or are just introducing your pallet to sushi, this is a good spot to start."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great sushi restaurant with outstanding service, great price, this is it. We were told it would be about 20mins for a table, within 8-10mins we were seated!! :) Placed our order with our waitress and within 5mins we had our food! Service is spot on and the food tastes great.   Definitely will he coming back when we're in town again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices.  The crunchy spicy tuna is great!  The rolls are not too big but still filling."}
{"text":"Very nice place Service was great! Sushi was pleasing.  Overall a very good experience. Would definitely return and recommend to others"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp I just tried this place last Friday night and I was very satisfied! My table of 3 shared 2 Las Vegas rolls, 1 California Roll (for the new to sushi person), wontons, garlic edamame, and gyoza all on the happy hour menu for $30! And it was really good quality! I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Probably some of the most unique rolls in Phoenix! Great atmosphere, great quality fish, and a nice staff set for a great time! My best friend and I eat here almost every week!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in such a long time. Its in a weird location with horrible parking but it is worth it. We had a Tempura shrimp roll, tootsie roll and a spicy tuna roll. Everything was fresh and delicious. I also had a Sinful Geisha cocktail that was amazing. I highly recommend to anyone who is in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place in Phoenix. Great tasting nigiri, sashimi and unique rolls. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sushiholic has great quality fish. Fresh sashimi, super buttery - my favorite! However, their service does not compare to the quality of their food. I've eaten at Sushiholic several times, and each time I waited an exceptional amount of time for a server to greet our table and take our order. Honestly, on average it takes about 20 minutes to just to have a server come to our table to place our order. The food comes relatively quickly, but ordering another round or having your beverage arrive from the bar takes a long time. I've never gotten out of there in less than 1 and 45 minutes as a party of 2. If you're not in a hurry, this is a great sushi option in Phoenix. If you need to get in and out in less than an hour and a half, even for a mid afternoon late lunch, pick another destination."}
{"text":"This place makes me happy.  My new favorite Japanese/Sushi restaurant for PHX/Scottsdale.  Order the Spicy Sashito Peppers to start, then the Spicy Chili Chicken and finish with any of their amazing Sushi rolls.  Amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is delicious, been here twice. I need to come back to try more. The first time was great service as it was not busy. The second time was subpar but will give her a pass as it was lunchtime and a bit busier... I will be back"}
{"text":"Great sushi! They have a lot of gluten free options too, including gf soy sauce. The \"school bus\" was my favorite roll."}
{"text":"Being new to the Phoenix area and working in the Arcadia neighborhood, I decided to start scouting out some good sushi joints to expand our options beyond the midtown/downtown area. Sushiholic is a legit sushi restaurant that has some really cool signature rolls and they definitely execute on the classics. I like their spicy rolls and the Vegas roll. The sushi chefs are mindful of my avocado allergy which can cause some issues at other places. Being the consummate beer enthusiast I tell myself I am, I feel like they are sorely lacking in non Asian beers. I personally do not care for the malty Asian offerings, and would love it if they had an option for an IPA or two. I do understand why they offer the beers they do, as they are a Sushi place, but I think it would be something for them to consider."}
{"text":"Brand new sushi restaurant in Arcadia! Inside looks very trendy. They are waiting on liquor license, so no sake bomb with sushi today, but it looks like an awesome spot for happy hour.    Tried their spicy tuna (my go-to roll for basing quality), Climax roll, Amigo roll, and Dragon roll. All are right on the dot!  Spicy tuna has good spice to it and sauces are yummy as well. The shrimp and eels were still warm. There were only 2 other tables, so service were fast. my server was still training, so they couldn't answer everything, but still very nice.   I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Fabulous!  Fresh, beautiful sushi, attentive severs and a lovely atmosphere.  Ate with a party of seven and ordered 10 rolls. The rolls were large and delicious. I highly recommend this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Phoenix - and I lived in NYC and Seattle. Quality."}
{"text":"Sushi-holic was a great experience for a new restaurant in the Arcadia area! The sushi was fresh and flavorful and service was great. The staff made good recommendations on the menu and the atmosphere is perfect for a casual night out. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We came tonight for our first visit (excited to try a sushi spot in the Arcadia area) and it won't be our last! We sat at the bar (unfortunately right between happy hours) and our waitress was attentive and helpful, offering several great suggestions for sushi. The First Love roll was delicious and unique with a small slice of lemon on top. The special Atkins roll wrapped in cucumber was fresh and light- delish! We also has the crab puffs and Amigo roll- everything was tasty and fresh... and reasonably priced! It's nice to have a go-to sushi spot in the area! We will return!"}
{"text":"Love it! All day happy hour prices, good sushi, nice atmosphere. Not fancy by any means but cool and great location! Good sushi spot in Arcadia."}
{"text":"Probably some of the freshest sushi I've had in the valley and very creative with their rolls. Happy hour is great too and really like that they have it every day until 7pm... Later than most. Atmosphere and service follow suit.... Contemporary but comfortable and awesome staff.   Overall, excellent new arcadia neighborhood  hang out and highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Sushiholic is a wonderful Arcadia neighborhood sushi restaurant.  I have been there more than 5 times now, and all the food is fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend trying their salmon sushi: it is some of the freshest salmon I've had in the Valley!  I also love getting their spicy edamame, and their crispy spicy tuna (scoop of spicy tuna atop a crunchy rice ball topped with sauce and a jalapeno...it's amazing!).  What's also amazing is that they are almost always on happy hour.....I mean 2pm-close always. It's fantastic!  Definitely check out Sushiholic when you're in the neighborhood.  You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"The service here was very impressive. Carla took really good care of me and she was so much fun. These people love people and the place is very clean and inviting. The food was very yummy and fresh. I had some sushi leftover and Carla set it all up for me to go on ice. I totally recommend this place. I will gladly be back."}
{"text":"Well here we go... where to start. Lets start by walking in with a family of 10 that came from the dodgers game. The restaurant  place was highly recommended. Now I would like to state my claim before I go into detail. I have eaten at a lot I mean a lot of shusi places both great and bad. But truly i feel this place sits in the middle. I don't understand  those that have rated this place a 5. I feel probably non of you have ever had sushi like it is suppose to be. but that's a little bias for me to say but I am saying it anyways.   So continuing, the family sat down waitress was cool we order drinks some miso soup and a few other light appetizers. When the miso came out it tasted like Lee Lee boxed miso soup water down just a bit. Not saying Lee Lee miso box soup isn't good just saying not restraunt quality. Next we order 4 special rolls, the booty booty, Las vegas, Alaska roll. And then we had some other cheaper rolls. Those were average nothing signature nothing special I was not  excited about it. Next we order to huge things of sashimi my favorite. Not at this place though.. I feel bad for the owner the sushi chef sucks at his cuts no pride in his job.. lol your loosing money. I feel like they over cut to compensate for the lack of quality in fish. Cuts were sloppy, way over cut, and not presentable for the amount of stars this place has, let bring it to reality.   Next we order sweet shrimp. the heads were Burnt and the quality of the shrimp looked like they been frozen not fresh. The taste was as if they were frozen and the texture was as if they were frozen they looked like little wrinkled sad sacks.   In addition we ordered uni uni has a beautiful color when it's fresh this uni was brown not good didn't even try it sent it back after just looking at it.   In conclusion to all this I rate this place a two for not serving fresh and good quality food this place has a high rating do probably to there happy hour prices which looked very reasonable so all in all if you don't mind eating average sushi to get your bang for your buck this might be your go to but if your looking for quality and freshness it's not this place. If you are reading this and love sushi for the beautiful fish and freshness and don't mind spending a little money I would recommend YANAGI SUSHI in Chandler these people spend a Lil extra time and a Lil extra on the quality they serve. Probably the best in Arizona. But again I haven't eaten at all sushi restraunts here."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour Sushi I have found in the Scottsdale/Arcadia area. Great menu with amazing prices. Great staff, fun sushi bar, TV's for sports, and large enought to not have too long of a wait."}
{"text":"I know sushi and this place is amazing. Right up there with all the top places I've been around the country. Super friendly staff and got to meet the owner who was there to ensure our evening was perfect. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Intimate atmosphere with sushi fusion rolls makes SushiHolic an excellent place for your sushi fix.    The staff is extrmely attentive and takes the time to know your name. Check out their happy hour specials and don't shy away from the Mochi dessert. It's devine"}
{"text":"Thought I should probably leave an update since this is still BY FAR my favorite sushi spot in Phoenix! :)   The sushi is fresh with lots of different roll combinations, and for the price you can't beat it. They have great hours (be careful, closed on Sundays!) and usually on happy hour or reverse happy hour.   They recently expanded into the space next door since they are so busy, if that tells you anything :)  My favorite rolls are the New York and Sweet Thang! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Plum wine was delicious! Everything tasted so fresh! We went on a Monday night it was busy but the service was great. We sat outside and the fans were kind of annoying. I definitely come back."}
{"text":"Super super supe SlOW service. Sat and watched my lunch sit under the lights for over 10 min. Kathy our server was not attentive. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Wow is really the word. Great happy hour prices, fresh food, great drinks, great service. There is really no downside to this new place. We will be regulars here. The fresh made wasabi was seriously over the top."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic sushi for such a good price, and has amazing service!!! We had a 10/10 experience here."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Amazing sushi,amazing service, amazing prices! I've heard about this place for a while and decided to try it out one day. I am so glad I did. It has become my new favorite sushi place. They have a fantastic happy hour (that seem to last all day) and they have great quality sushi. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised on how good of a sushi place this is. I highly recommend as a must check-out for sushi and japanese food lover. On point!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Arcadia! Carla is our girl! We love the atmosphere, the food is the freshest you will find and the drinks area amazing! It's our go-to Happy Hour spot!!!!   They have Happy Hour all week long and it's awesome prices and super fresh generous portions. The owner owns two other VERY popular Sushi places in Phoenix and often in the evening you can spot him there working or making Sushi!"}
{"text":"SO. GOOD. This place is small and easy to drive by, but the Yelp reviews drove me in. I'm a sushi snob who spent some time (aka the best summer of my life) working in a sushi bar. I love that this place has basic rolls plus some truly unique specialty rolls. I'm so glad to see they don't have too many deep fried rolls - that trend annoys me immensely. Prices are good for the quality and they have both happy hour and reverse happy hour. Sushiholic does not take reservations and they get busy - there is a pretty small seating area so either show up early or be prepare to wait."}
{"text":"Pretty good veggie roll and the Las Vegas roll looked amazing. Quick service. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this place. The service was fast and friendly.  We got 2 rolls on their lunch special, one specialty roll, and an order of the yellowtail sashimi.  The girl brought out fresh wasabi on the house to try with the sashimi and it was delicious. The other rolls were equally good.  Our tab for everything came out to less than $30. Great deal for the quality.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Delish! Incredibly fresh, great service, knowledgeable staff on gluten free items. Happy Hour prices are hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Me and a friend that I haven't seen in 3 years decided to hang out here yesturday night around 11, an hour before they were closing. It was my first time so I was interested in trying a new place whereas my friend eats here all the time as he stated, everything seemed good the vibe and service was good. I ordered the alaska roll, fish seemed good with me while my friend ordered monkey brain and a tray with a variety of different fish (not sure what it was called) so when we left, not even 6 minutes after we left my friend driving me home started to feel sick and out of nowhere threw up all over himself and his windshield, he automatically pulled over and threw up basically everything he ate.. I work in a sushi bar and if I didn't know better whether they were aware or not I'd say what they served him was spoiled fish, he was too sick to even drive back and ask for his money back.. sorry but I won't be back.."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi around! Reasonably priced and so many different kinds of sushi to choose from. The Amigo roll is bomb!"}
{"text":"This place ended up being a great happy hour find. They are still waiting on their liquor license, but it looks like they will have the simple beer and wine, so be patient!   The hostess sat us down and explained the menus to us and the history behind the concept and the owner for the place. I thought that was really cool because you don't normally get that. What I liked about this place was how fresh everything was - and I am SUPER picky about fish in the desert. The hostess explained that people normally get afraid of the pricing (its fairly inexpensive for this sushi) the owner wanted this place to be a family friendly environment that wouldn't break anyone's bank. It was only the two of us and we only really wanted a snack and with tip, we spent $20 on two apps and two rolls. I think that's pretty awesome for anyone, not just a family!   We went home after and told my little sister about it and she went right over and enjoyed a couple rolls on her own and said they were awesome. We will be making it back to this place and can't wait until we can have the full happy hour experience."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Best sushi in town! But sad they are closed on Sundays! I can't wait to go back for some more. And I'm moving a little closer to them so I'm happy about that. (:"}
{"text":"All I gotta say is.... this place is PERFECT!!!! Oh my gosh! The sushi is perfect! Fresh, perfect size, delicious in flavor. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was great especially for the revere \"Happy Hour\"! We went for Valentines Weekend and I was stressing over wait time but there wasn't a wait at all. Superb service friendly hostess and attentive waiter. Our food was delicious and fast with no complaints. It was a little loud with no music and that's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars! I would suggest a DJ to help with crowd noise. Price for the food was great too! I would like to see a better ambiance."}
{"text":"Popped in to grab a quick bite with my husband. Happy hour starts at 3pm - even on weekends. They have an excellent menu with delicious options.  - Spicy garlic edamame is amazing! - Seaweed salad is light and tasty - Atkins roll is yellowtail, salmon, crab, tuna, and avocado wrapped in cucumber. Delicious! - Spicy tuna roll is very good, as well.   While the man running the show was busy, he made sure we were taken care of. What a great experience! We will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"This place has really good HH sushi. Also, I think after 3 it's Happy Hour for almost the rest of the night.  I've been here a couple times, and what I really like about it is that they have SEVERAL items on HH. Lots of appetizers and MANY rolls. Not just your run of the mill California & tuna rolls. Things like tootsie and Las Vegas rolls as well. Most of these are around five bucks each. Everything I've tried from here has tasted good.    They also have good drink specials during HH. If I remember correctly sake bombers are under ten dollars for large ones, and they have cocktails for $7 each.   It's a pretty nice place and service is good."}
{"text":"One of our favorite sushi restaurants in town! It doesn't look like much from the street as it is part of a small shopping plaza in Arcadia, but you won't be disappointed when you give it a try.   They recently expanded the space and looks trendy and clean inside.  The staff is always extremely friendly and the service is fast. The sushi tastes fresh and the rolls are perfectly prepared. Try to get in during their happy hour or reverse happy hour. You won't get better sushi and the price is unbeatable....You must try the jalapeño poppers!"}
{"text":"Review 10/10 for the 10 bookmarked businesses to review before the end of 2016! From Meagan B.'s thread: https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016  Sushiholic was the perfect restaurant to end the 10 review challenge on. We came here on a Wednesday night and it was packed! Despite it being so busy, we didn't have to wait too long for a table, maybe a few minutes. The restaurant has lunch specials from 11-2, an amazing happy hour that extends from 2-8, and then reverse happy hour from 8-close. Basically, the restaurant offers discounted food and drink at any point in time during their normal hours of operation :).  We indulged in some happy hour items such as the monkey brain (AKA stuffed mushrooms), jalapeño poppers, spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll, shrimp tempura roll, rainbow roll, and gyoza. All were delectable bites and the rolls had nicely cooked rice with fresh fish, a lovely balance of textures and flavors in each.   I also shared some regular rolls not on the happy hour menu such as the spider roll, and also had some tonkatsu ramen. The spider roll was presented as four large pieces, with lightly fried and battered soft shell crab. The tonkatsu was average. I loved the soft boiled egg, but the broth was not as rich tasting as others I've had like at Tampopo or Nishikawa. It had a lighter flavor, less of a pork-infused taste with a lot of garlic in it. It was served with bamboo shoots, sprouts, sliced pork, half an egg, sliced wood ear mushrooms and naruto. The actual ramen noodles were decent but I like Tampopo's freshly made noodles as the best in the Phoenix area.  Service was excellent even though it was so busy tonight. Drinks were refilled as needed and plates were whisked away promptly.  So, go here for the sushi and the great happy hour and you will leave as a true Sushiholic!  P.S. Shout out to Suzie W. for her check-ins and review which made me want to try their food!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been here and it was amazing every single time! Plus the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Went in for my second time, and it was amazing! Love the sushi, great price. My server, Samantha was the sweetest too! Great service. Shout out to her for giving me a great experience!"}
{"text":"So excited for an AWSOME be sushi place right by us. Went for HH last night and was SO happy. Great food and service. Perfect new spot."}
{"text":"Good food, ordered garlic edamame which was ok, fried calamari was the best with its hot and sweet sauce. We tried Las Vegas, rainbow and Arizona rolls they were nice , soft and fresh. Would have preferred crispier Vegas rolls but overall they were good. Arizona rolls were my favorite."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Sushiholic's sushi. Their fresh fish and great customer service have won me over. We've eaten in and picked-up many times. I stop in weekly or almost weekly and they quickly came to know my name. Sedona is outstanding, she's one of the hostesses and she is always cheerful and attentive. The only disappointment is that there's sometimes a wait, plan accordingly though because it's more than worth it.   Also, the crispy spicy tuna roll is awesome."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi that I have had so far. I'm not that much into sushi but I take the wife once in a while. I am beginning to enjoy it more. I definitely like it from sushiholic and I would actually come back even if it's by myself. Very good."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! service was excellent and food was awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered the guilty pleasure roll, yellow tail, salmon, spicy tuna and Champon.  Guilty pleasure roll - ok, nothing special the white Hawaiian Tuna was barely noticeable.    Yellowtail - Fresh, not bad   Salmon - Fresh, nice and fatty flavor comes out  Champon - The good (The soup base is very authentic Korean Champon, and very smooth and not very heavy). The bad (I would add sautéed beef baby bok choy clams muscle and I would remove the shell from the jumbo shrimp.  If you're gonna call it a traditional Korean Champon, you should add traditional Korean noodles and not use Ramen noodles!  I would also use a larger bowl, increase the noodle portion and also add Kim Chee as a side dish!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have found this place! The service was friendly and fast, and the happy hour prices, which last until close (they have a reverse happy hour once the regular one is over) are amazingly reasonable. The rolls are delicious, too. Basically, you can't lose here. If you're looking for a sushi place that won't break the bank but also has quality food, Sushiholic is it. The wait on Friday night was significant, but it's easy to see why, and was absolutely worth it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here last night with some friends. Basically it's happy hour all day lol. Decent prices compared to some places we've gone to.  Not bad at all taste wise too.  Food came out pretty quick.  Service was good, nothing crazy. Overall a simple nice meal easing !  Good job sushiolic. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi, but a very noisy environment. Wait staff were very attentive and suggested some great dishes. Overall a good experience food wise, the environment was lacking a little."}
{"text":"Getting my weekly Sushiholic lunch fix, I tend to order my regular favorites but I do try to deviate from the norm and order other dishes and sushi which have been all great.  The last 3 times I have been here, I've tried the Spicy Scallop Sushi, Sashimi Salad (marinated tuna, salmon, yellowtail, whitefish, on lettuce and spring mix) and the Shoyu Ramen, all fresh and delicious.  Love my addiction! Atmosphere: nice, Service: excellent, Food: excellent"}
{"text":"This is a really good sushi place and we've been quite a few times now. Their miso soup is good and we always share several rolls. They have a large selection of rolls too, which is nice. Service can be a little spotty, sometimes being great and other times being forgotten but for the most part its not too bad. Overall this is a great place for some yummy sushi."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I wasn't very impressed. However, I have since returned twice and both experiences were really good. They basically have happy hour all day. If you're going during non-happy hour times, you're doing it wrong. If you try to go on a weekend-night, do expect a wait as it's a very popular spot. Their happy hour food menu is pretty large and there's a decent amount of selection. I personally like the rolls here. If you're looking for sashimi or actual sushi, I would probably go somewhere else to be honest."}
{"text":"Samantha was an amazing server and made our experience great.   There were people in our party on the keto diet and she provided excellent recommendations without any frustration.  She made my friends birthday special!!    We go here often but experiences like this make us continue to be regulars!"}
{"text":"All the rolls we have tried are always delicious and fresh. I'm especially fond of the daily happy hour menu they have starting at 2pm! Crispy Spicy Tuna is my favorite to start with!  Friendly staff. Never too bad of a wait even on a Friday night around 7pm"}
{"text":"Sushiholic is my favorite sushi place around Phoenix.  The fish is always fresh and you can't be their happy hour.  I split the sashimi for two special the other day and the slices of sashimi were so thick and delicious.  Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"Awesome selection!  Highly recommend.  I would highly recommend the jalapeño tuna app, extra tasty!"}
{"text":"I wish my phone wasn't dead or I would have taken all kinda pics and of the dinner and how cheap it was for such good sushi! Appetizer, drinks and 3 rolls for less then $30 and on happy hour! The only thing I have to say is bad, is the seating and how close you are to the other people next to you at the other table. Basically you can hear everything in their convo like tonight's couple next to us. It was very uncomfortable being that close to strangers and being able to hear their convo. Service was on point, quick to deliver our food drinks and appetizer. It's def good for dates and groups, it's a tad bit loud but it's expected for a small place like that. I'll def be going back with my parter and or others that love Sushi!"}
{"text":"So good I had to come back two days later. Best spot in Phoenix hands down and very affordable."}
{"text":"Maybe a 2.5...nice open area...but is it a sports bar or a sushi restaurant?  Not bad.  Service was excellent, very friendly, engaging and helpful. The High Roll was good. Would go back if in the area but not a draw for me."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night and it was PACKED! We got a table in under 15 minutes and the service was awesome for it being so busy. Happy hour until 8 pm and reverse happy hour starting at 9 pm. Great prices on the sushi even if it wasn't on the HH menu. Apparently the hot green tea is BOTTOMLESS which is the best thing since mimosas  definite recommend"}
{"text":"Sushiholic was very average at best. The vibes were good and fun and the service was fast. However, the menu was very repetitive. The rolls were all the same. Each roll option had a spicy tuna/salmon base with eel sauce. Not every roll should be doused in eel sauce. What is the point of soy sauce at that point if everything has eel sauce on it.   The worst of all was the sashimi. The sashimi was cut in blocks not slices. It was like the chef took a block of fish and put his knife through it straight down from the top. No sushi art or technique was included in the sashimi. This was so bad that the yellowtail sashimi pieces weren't even full cut through so basically it was a block of fish that we had to cut ourselves. Very disappointed. Waste of money for the sashimi. I could have cut it better."}
{"text":"Ate there during happy hour yesterday and have horrible food poisoning today. The only other thing I had yesterday was a fruit salad so I'm 100% sure it was this restaurant. I ate the chasu pork, potato wrapped shrimp, tuna nigiri, salmon nigiri and a cucumber salad. Not cool guys, step it up."}
{"text":"From the Hostess to the Waitress...Everyone was very friendly, and accommodating. The sushi was great & taste fresh. Great Place!"}
{"text":"Happy hour! We didn't want to drive downtown, so for sushi night, Nicole H. recommended Sushiholic for reasonably priced rolls on happy hour.   Wow, I stuffed myself with great tasting sushi and a big variety of rolls. Two crunchy ones were my favs. Nicole H. took charge of the ordering (a feast fit for a king), so I'm not exactly sure of everything that I ate, but it was all delish."}
{"text":"They offer two happy hours in the evening, one earlier and one later. It is a great price during the happy hour! Sushi is good and have a lot of options on the HH menu!"}
{"text":"Try this place for the first time the monkey brains are delicious. The sushi is great too lots of options also recommend the fried rice. They would gotten 5 but the service wasn't all there took forever to get our order and there was only one server for 6 tables."}
{"text":"This place was so great! I brought a friend for California here for us to try together for the first time and we ordered a ton! Miso Soup, Monkey Brain (Spicy Tuna stuffed Mushrooms), Spicy Edamame, Spicy Tuna Hand Roll, a deep fried roll and 3 special rolls! Not one thing was bad or not worth getting. They have an awesome happy hour, our entire bill was about $70 and for great quality and quantity. I will only say I deducted a star because our server offered us a \"surprise\" and brought out fresh Wasabi - absolutely amazing but when the bill came he charged us for it. While we happily paid for it (it was like $2.50 and definitely not a fair portion at that price), it was upsetting that he offered something as a surprise and then charged us for it - regardless if we liked it or not. Other than that, I definitely say try this place!"}
{"text":"This has been our go-to sushi spot since it opened. The spicy garlic edamame, the specialty rolls like the booty booty and the second climax.. also has great, vibey atmosphere and a competent staff."}
{"text":"Just meh. They drench every roll with the exact same 3 sauces and pretty much loose the flavor of any fish that should be the star! One plus is they stay open til midnight."}
{"text":"Really good food! The chicken katsu curry is amazing; soft chicken on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Great value on the other items on the menu and very fast at serving food."}
{"text":"Ever have the misfortune of late-night sushi cravings? It sucks, right? Very tough to find a place that's open late, especially on the weekends.   Ladies and gentlemen, it appears yours truly has stumbled upon a solution.   They have a reverse happy hour from 8-midnight on weekdays. Do take advantage of rather tasty rolls, or some fresh salmon nigiri at affordable prices. The appetizers are generous to the point of filling, and won't break the bank either.   Service was spot on. I think my server's name was Kathy, and she was swift, courteous, and helped ensure I can trust sushiholic for future visits.   It's a great date spot, but also good for groups!  Come stuff your face, and top it off with a cold one. =)"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Visiting from Seattle and we are pretty spoiled with sushi up there, but I'm thoroughly impressed with this place. Their happy hour menu is awesome and our server was super friendly. The crispy spicy tuna is to die for. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My daughter Ava and I decided a little daddy/daughter sushi was the choice for lunch today. We never have been to Sushiholic, but the reviews were good on Yelp so in we went.   It is a cool looking little place in a strip center at 40th St and Camelback. Ava decided she wanted to sit at a table instead of the sushi bar.  Our server was very nice and even, after we ordered, told us what we ordered fit within one of the lunch specials and would save us a few dollars. That was a cool gesture.  We started with edamame. It came out hot, which we liked. It was salted well and tasted good.  Of course the lunch choice was sushi! Ava wanted California rolls. I also ordered us spicy tuna rolls, and tuna and salmon sushi.   Ava ate all of the California roll. She said it was awesome! She said that because it tasted yummy and she could eat it with chopsticks.  She did not try the sushi. It was good. Both the tuna and salmon were fresh and had good flavor.  Ava tried raw sushi for the first time trying the spicy tuna roll. She had a number of pieces and liked it! She said this one also tasted yummy and had the right amount of spice to it.   Ava also tried wasabi for the first time. She started light and steadily increased how much she was using. Ava likes spicy and thought it was great with the sushi.  So it was a most excellent daddy/daughter lunch adventure. Ava highly recommends you check this place out!"}
{"text":"It was Friday night and we were hungry.  What to do?  Where to go?  We live in a fantastic neighborhood with several great places within walking distance - The Grind, North, Rustic Pizza, LGO/Ingo's, Chelsea's kitchen - with their awesome patio.  It was all getting so rote though.  We wanted something different.  Daughter suggests Sushiholic.  Now, I am not a fish eater, and I have allergic reactions to shellfish, so this would not have been my first choice.  However, the ladies convinced me that there would be stuff I would enjoy.  They were so right.  We walked over around 7pm and they were packed. Waiting a mere 15 minutes while we studied the extensive menu of fishy things and other stuff, we finally got a table.  Right off, the atmosphere took me back too many years to admit, to my days sitting at a bar on the Honch,  The only thing missing was The Eagles, Hotel California - which at the time appeared to be on every jukebox in every bar in every town in Japan.  Anyway, I ordered a Kirin Ichiban and Galbi short ribs.  The ladies had some fish sorta-thing with rice and ginger and wasabi.  Soon my bottle of Kirin arrived, accompanied by a glass with an Asahi label.  Bad form, but the waittress claimed that's all they had, personally, I don't think she understood basic beer etiquette.  Anyway, the beer was cold and tasty despite the wrong glass :-).  The platter of ribs arrived sizzling on a bed of grilled onions.  We scarfed it quickly.  The ribs were okay, kinda chewy, but flavorful.  Surprisingly, the onions were tasty as well, and the platter  was soon cleared.  The waitress was summoned back so we could order dinner.  For me, that meant another bottle of Kirin, some Gyoza , which are pork dumplings and a big bowl of Tonkatsu Ramen.  The ladies ordered more fishy stuff.  The Ramen was a giant bowl of awesome noodles, again bringing back memories of post-party Ramen slurping on the Honch.  This soup was a flavorful broth of hard-boiled egg, radish, sliced pork and other stuff.  It was quite tasty, and large.  Dropping the dumplings in like wontons created a meal that was too much for even me.  I sadly left at least a third of the broth, I just could not slurp anymore.  The ladies really enjoyed their fishy stuff too.  Service was good, prices reasonable and the food quite tasty.  It's kinda weird, but the unisex bathrooms were super-cool.  One is like a mini-lounge, clean enough that you could have a private party in there."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch for my birthday and was disappointed. My sister and I ordered four rolls. We got one right away and the others never came. Turned out another waitress gave the rest of our food to another table. After 10 more minutes a different waitress tried to give us a roll we already got. The food was good but the service was such an unorganized mess. The check wasn't even discounted, we were there for way longer than necessary and still paid full price. NOT RETURNING."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom! This place has very creative  and unique sushi rolls. The service is great, the atmosphere is cozy and cosmopolitan. This is my fave sushi spot here in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Some friends told me about this place. This place is small, and loud. I honestly didn't mind it but others might. This is one of those small, hole in the wall joints that are amazing. It was super busy when I got there. 10 minutes passed after taking my order and out came my miso soup. Perfect soup. 25 minutes later, my waiter came and asked me if there was anything else I needed, or if he should bring me the check... \" Oh I'm still waiting on food.\" He looked puzzled and said oh I'm sorry and walked away. 15 minutes later , the sushi maker handed me my plate. I ate a piece of the rainbow and it was delicious. My other roll, the crunch roll, was super salty. I had to douse it in Sriracha for it to be edible. Since it took so long to get my food, I decided to just endure it. As soon as I put my chopsticks down, my waiter swoops in and drops off the check and bids me a wonderful day. Serious? I gave my card, signed my check and left. That seriously put a damper on my experience. Didn't even offer dessert, didn't offer any additional items. Not quite sure about coming back."}
{"text":"Got some take out there on a short trip to Phoenix. We got a bunch of rolls and some salmon and tuna nigiri.  Place was really cute, not too noisy, dim lights.   Sushi was pretty decent. The fish tasted fresh. It was good enough that I had no complaints but just not enough that I can remember how it was 2 months out.  Staff was friendly, kept checking on while we were waiting for our take out to make sure we were okay.  Definitely willing to give it another go soon!"}
{"text":"Got seated right away and staff was nice.. our food came out right away and our waitress was very attentive.. if I am in the area I'll Probably stop here again"}
{"text":"Looking to make a party and they refused to make any accomodations for late entry or reservations. They put me on hold for a manager, who was snide AND sounded like the first person who answered the phone  So, I'll never be doing a food rating."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty big fan of sushiholic. Their lunch menu and happy hour is fantastic. The service is always greats and very fast! I've tried the sushi which is always good and I love the bento box. The only problem I have is that the bento box is only on the lunch special! I would love it for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Had a great first time here.  Sat at the bar and ordered the bento box.  Huge portions and really enjoyed the California roll, miso soup, and gyoza.  The chicken teriyaki was good but I would probably try a different entree next time.  So many sushi and sashimi options to choose from.   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in the city! Great staff and awesome prices. They recently expanded the restaurant for more seating. For the amount of food and quality you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"We frequent this sushi spot when we are up in Phoenix for work. We enjoy this spot because it's pretty centrally located and they do reverse happy hour!!! It's reserve HH from 8-11p (don't quote me, though)   Quality sushi, nice vibe, and decent service. We have only been here for a \"later\" dinner and it's always been poppin! People in the neighborhood must know about the reverse HH. 2 rolls & miso has never cost me more than $20- a steal when you're working on per diem.   Would highly recommend if you need a sushi spot in PHX. I believe we originally chose it based on the substantial amount of yelp reviews :) adding to the party."}
{"text":"Not my neck of the woods so decided to trust Yelp. Didn't disappoint. Lunch time was busy which is always a good sign to me. I had the sushi lunch. Very fresh and delicious food. I'll be back. Great service too!"}
{"text":"This is the place to be! Friendly staff and AMAZING food! Anything on the menu is very enjoyable! Intimate and fun environment with great Happy hour specials! My fav is the Sake bomb special!"}
{"text":"I bookmarked this location a few weeks back to try  when my boyfriend came to visit me. My boyfriend and I had a busy weekend moving me into a new apartment this passed weekend and needed a much deserved break. We got to Sushiholic around 5pm for their happy hour. Which apparently is from 3pm to close. The parking lot is a little tough since it is shared with a few other restaurants in the complex,but we were lucky that someone was leaving. We walked in and it wasn't too busy. However, when we were leaving there was a line of people out the door. The hostess greeted us and sat us down near a window, which I loved because I got to people watch.  We were then greeted by the greatest server named Seth! He was so friendly and really seemed to enjoy his job. He recommended their speciality sashimi for $17.00 which wasn't on the happy hour menu, but he sold it so well. My boyfriend ordered it and enjoyed every bite. At the end, the chef deep frys the fish. We also got a order of shrimp tempura , spicy garlic edamame, spicy shrimp crunch roll, spicy tuna crunch roll and California roll. Everything was amazing and the presentation was also beautiful. The food wasn't heavy and didn't make us feel bloated at all. We even had room for dessert, which I am so glad we did because the green tea deep fried tempura ice cream was to die for!! I definitely recommend this place it is affordable, great happy hour prices, amazing service, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Really good sushi and the prices can't be beat the only reason for 4 star's is they never get my to-go order right"}
{"text":"Environment was inviting and the restaurant decoration is aesthetically pleasing. Waitress was very attentive and courteous. Food was good and Ingredients tasted fresh. The restaurant offers the classic sushi restaurant menu at a nice location.  The front part of the restaurant makes inviting during the cooler months and/or brunch."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood option for sushi and happy hour. Owner buses tables and serves.  Happy hour runs from 3 to 7, then it's reverse happy hour from 8 onward!   Excellent value on lunch specials as well (like 3 rolls for $10). Quality is better than some trendy places like Ra or Sushi Brokers) IMO."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially Sedona, she is the best server. We always love seeing her friendly face. She is the reason why we keep coming back, as long as she is here we will come back. Sushi is great here and the service is amazing, feels like we are home when we are here"}
{"text":"Good sushi, large menu. BEST happy hour. I feel like it never ends. We got the monkey brain (it's stuffed mushroom or something), rainbow roll, edamame, potstickers and another roll all for about $25 bucks. The sauce on the monkey brain was different, hard to describe. We were pleased with service and the food and will definitely be back.   The restaurant is large, a little dark but nice ambience. Parking sucks. We drove around a few times and ended up parking in the back of the building."}
{"text":"My favorite place on Earth. Great (+fast) service and happy hour is a steal!! Open late too so I go anytime I need my sushi fix."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Got a flyer on our door and decided to check it out. Friendly staff and great food. Fish is the freshest sushi I've had in AZ. Can't wait until they get their liquor license so we can add it to our HH rotation. Best sushi in the area."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place in Scottsdale/Phoenix. I have gone everywhere trying to find sushi as good as SF, and this place has it. The fish was so fresh it literally melted in your mouth. So damn good."}
{"text":"Kelton provided us with excellent service, and the rolls were super fresh! Strongly recommend the climax roll, as well as the Arizona and the Snow White! Everything was tremendous, but without question the climax was the show stopper. Can't imagine there's much better sushi in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for Sushi!  Love the ambience!  Sushi was really yummy!  Giving only 4 stars because the service was slow.  We were there on a Wednesday night for dinner."}
{"text":"i recommend this place 100%...the service was excellent...especially the chef Felipe who gave us excellent suggestions of new things to try...all of the seafood was fresh..we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is an absolutely addictive place. Twice a week I eat here and you can't beat the lunch special. The sushi is on point and the staff is always helpful and friendly. Make  a this your next spot and you will become a Sushiholic:)"}
{"text":"I'm Asian and from a state that sells fresh seafood.  The spicy ahi is disgusting here. It tastes really fishy.  The white sauce that drizzle on top their makis tastes like straight MAYO. It's crowded in here. Too loud to talk to anyone. Tables are too close together. I've found a better sushi place up north. This sushi place is too \"Americanized\" This is not like authentic sushi. Btw, their gyoza is FROZEN from the Asian grocery store. NOT homemade.  I was disappointed because the yelp rating is high but some people obviously don't know what good sushi really is."}
{"text":"was ok. sushi rice was dry and hard. Fish didnt seem very fresh. would try another sushi place next time"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come here.  The cocktails are different and refreshing.  Love the miso. The sushi is great.  The only thing I've tried that I haven't liked was the ramen.  Even with that I'm never satisfied eating here until I hate myself for eating that last gluttony roll."}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh, reasonably priced and the service was outstanding.   We came in on a Friday night, just before 8 pm and had a short wait of 15 mins for a table (for 4). We ordered edamame, squid salad, rolls and nigiri. Our waiter, Sepehr, recommended a Toro sashimi special and it was some of the best Toro we have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Great sushi, friendly servers, casual atmosphere, and great happy hour! I absolutely recommend this place the food is fresh and the cocktails are great."}
{"text":"Awesome venue great food and service only down side is that you cannot order off the happy hour menu to go :(  great prices and high quality food !! If you can find it in your hearts to let us buy off the happy hour menu ill give you the extra star !!"}
{"text":"Place is lively, food is yummy!  Went there for my birthday yesterday, I chose this place because it pretty much has happy hour all day long!  Food is pretty decent, rolls are small, but yummy.  Sake bombers are only $8  Garlic Edamame is EVERYTHING!!!  I loved the atmosphere, very lively, bar atmosphere, but there were a few families, so it felt well balanced.  I loved it."}
{"text":"Great spot for sushi! My office recently moved into the neighborhood and a few of us were craving sushi. We stopped here and were pleasantly surprised.  They have an awesome lunch special. 3 rolls for just $10.95. You really can't beat that! I got the spicy tuna, spicy crab and salmon. All 3 were delicious and I couldn't believe the amount of food for such a great price.  Even during their late lunch rush through of came pretty quickly, a rare occurrence at a fresh sushi place.  We'll be coming back very soon. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Solid sushi.  Great Happy Hour (LOL). It is almost always Happy Hour!  You can seriously stuff yourself with succulent sushi for less than $20 and you don't just have to order California rolls.   The choices on the Happy Hour menu allow you to sample and savor a selection of scrumptious stuff from raw to cooked, mild to spicy and smooth to crunchy. What more could you ask for? Trumpets and tambourines! Snake charmers and fortune tellers and munchkins--oh my!  The food here is solid--maybe not wham bam excellent but tasty and fresh.  The service here is lightning fast, unless you arrive during prime time and there is a line outside and no empty tables anywhere.  I will return for more sushi when sushi time is here again."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much first time I went because it is a small spot, but was pleasantly surprised.  This is some of the very best sushi in Phoenix and reasonably priced. I love the environment too.  I now go almost weekly."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour prices (7 days a week!) it's my new favorite sushi place :) I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I walked in and was seated immediately at a comfy, chic table. The hostess was there immediately with water and asked us if we would like a beer. Nope, we're just doing food.  She smiles and disappears. We order too much. Miso soup, crab puffs, five sushi rolls. For two of us. Our Lady of Sushi is back in a flash with a refill and sweeps up our order.  A minute later, our Miso soup is on the table. Salty, tangy. Great warm-up. We're not even through sipping our Miso when the crab puffs hit the table. $5 gets something like 10 of them. We could have up and left after that, bellies full and hearts satisfied.  1/3 through the crab puffs our first platter of sushi hits the deck. 8 pieces of sushi per roll. Thick, uniform, half dollar circumferences, and a good nickel to quarter of that is the good stuff. I've experienced sushi this price that looks like a bag of rice thrown on a sliver of cream cheese and cod. Not here.  By the time our esophageal sphincter is warning of a system overload, a second platter descends upon the table. I hear a small demon cackle as we consciously cross the line into Gluttony.  By the time we have finished the third platter we're signing away inheritances and promising back massages, if only the other would consume the last morsel.  We beg for the check, visions of sprawling naked on our king sized bed swimming before our eyes. Call the doctor, stat. Coma is nigh.  The check comes. $35.  A little guilt wells in my soul. I think of the owner's daughter, who will not be able to go to college. I think of their young son, whose ragged stocking would flap empty on the mantelpiece this winter - the whistling draft of the cold chimney his only friend, tho all he wished for were a few sticks of kindling to warm his mittens.  All this, think I, so I may gorge on raw sea-meat, crushing ocean creatures in my gaping maw at affordable price of $5/roll.  What have I become."}
{"text":"I do agree with some other reviews that this place is overrated. Somewhere in between ok and good sushi, but nothing to be called great or best in Phoenix. We orderer the Climax roll, tiger roll and baked scallops with California roll. Nothing special, baked scallops were meh. I noticed they serve Ramen and ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen. I've Never had tonkotsu ramen with such strong fish flavor.  It was so strong that I couldn't even eat it. The waitress told me it was due to the fish cakes and amount of seaweed they use. Other than average food, the service and atmosphere were great."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been trying to find time to dine here for awhile.  Unfortunately, we chose the wrong night.  At least I hope this place isnt this horrible every night.  We arrived shortly before 10 pm,  the hostess (a sloppy dress female walked to a table and threw the menu's down and pivited away without a word.  First thought, she needs to be replaced or go home.  Didnt want to diminish the experience with just one inadequate employee,  so we patiently began to wait,  and wait,  and wait even longer til we were not so patiently waiting.  When we had finally decided to leave and find another place to dine our frantic server pops up \"any questions.\"  He was rude, asking questions he didn't care to hear a response from since clearly he was more interested in what was happening on the patio than attending our table.  Food was blahhhh,  place was freezing,  which just assured me I had found hell, and indeed it had froze over.  Once we were finally release after waiting again forever for check and then again for server to process card,  Won't be returning,  Plenty other restaurants that appreciate their guests and want them to feel comfortable enjoying their evening."}
{"text":"Very good happy hour pricing and fresh fish. Unfortunately they still do not have their liquor license so no sake bombers. Otherwise great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Ordered:  Cucumber salad - 4 stars Miso soup - 4 stars Sashimi combo - 5 stars Edamame - 4 stars Shrimp tempura roll - 4 stars Spicy tuna roll - 3 stars  Hamachi hand roll - 5 stars Unagi - 5 stars  Their sashimi is phenomenal. They had fish liver which made me very happy. The sizes of the sashimi pieces were just right. Everything tasted up to par and the bill was very reasonable for the amount of food we ordered."}
{"text":"So freaking good. I haven't had anything I didn't like yet out of all the times I've been in. Food comes out fast and fresh. The Arizona Roll is probably my favorite but it's hard to choose. Jalapeño poppers are excellent as well. Four stars just because service can be a hit or miss. Sometimes they are the perfect amount of attentive and sometimes they are MIA."}
{"text":"In the past we were always able to make reservations at the sushi bar with Carla. Not the case anymore. Big loss."}
{"text":"Great Lunch special! This has become my go to lunch spot and they have amazing specials. When I go for lunch, Ill order their sushi combo which includes two sushi rolls, 4 pieces of nigiri, soup and salad for around $10....what a steal! The sushi is also excellent and I would highly recommend trying this place for lunch or happy hour."}
{"text":"We've only eaten at Sushiholic once and we loved it. Their happy hour special is affordable and has great selections. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"It's hard to come by a good sushi spot in Arizona. This place has a good atmosphere and a variety of options to choose from on the menu. The ordering system was confusing, as there was one menu per table and this made it difficult for everyone to check off what sushi they wanted on one sheet. The service was good and the food came out fast enough. The spicy tuna was too spicy for me, so if you don't like super spicy foods this is not your ordinary spicy tuna. The spice made it almost inedible. Additionally, they put wasabi on the sashimi between the rice and the sushi which ruined the overall taste for someone who doesn't love food too spicy. The quality of the fish was top notch and it tasted fresh. Overall the food was outstanding and the recommendations from the waiter were awesome."}
{"text":"It's amazing how many places I still have not been to being a local for 25+ plus years. This place is a secret gem to the sushi game! Being that it was happy hour we took advantage of the saki drinks and sushi. Sep our waiter took us under his wing and basically gave us a custom sushi experience. He ordered everything for us and I never doubted any of his selections. Great time and i will be back! It's always happy hour there!"}
{"text":"We wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary with sushi and thought we'd pop into Sushiholic for a casual weeknight dinner. We were surprised by how busy it was on a Wednesday and thought it's probably a good indication of the food. We excitedly put our names on the list and were told the wait was 20 minutes. There is a very small waiting space in the front, so we were forced to wait outside. There were misters, but it still wasn't ideal. I checked in on our name at about 30 minutes and there were 3 names ahead of us. We waited another 20 or so and checked in again. This time my husband went in to realize that our name was crossed off and they had moved on to others behind us. We were waiting in the same exact place right outside the front door with many others the entire time and were super irritated that no one stepped outside to let us know it was our turn before moving on. When my husband mentioned that we had been waiting nearly an hour, the hostess told us that we weren't waiting that long and that we were next.   The rest of the experience was positive. Our server was kind and attentive. The food was great quality and the prices were awesome because we were able to order off the happy hour menu. We loved the food, but the experience with the hostess and the inefficiency of the restaurant might make us choose a different place in the future."}
{"text":"Good sushi - HORRIBLE service. We waited to be seated for 25 minutes even though there were plenty of tables. The waiters and sushi chefs ignored us completely - not even a \" we will be right with you\"! Then they sat us and we already knew what we wanted since we had so much time waiting at the front and immediately filled out the sheet. We wanted to order drinks but our waiter just offered water as we were sat and that took 15 minutes to get as well! I loved coming here but this experience really threw us off!"}
{"text":"We had the booty booty roll, climax and guilty pleasure rolls.  They were all very good and not overpriced.  Nice atmosphere and we had a nice time."}
{"text":"A fantastic place. Everything from the Decor to the absolutey charming staff.  The sushi is extremely well made and has a fresh simple taste.  The rice they use is fantastic (rice being a very important part of good sushi). I highly suggest you eat here."}
{"text":"Sat there for 20 minutes and nobody came and helped us.  Some dude actually meticulously rearranged the silverware at the table next to us and didn't even acknowledge us... Well he made eye contact with us and walked over to another table to meticulously rearrange the silverware.  No water.  We left and only then did they realize we were ever there.  The sushi looked good though.  But we probably were never going to get it."}
{"text":"Cheap, good sushi, right across the street from me, and an awesome happy hour that pretty much never ends. Worth checking out, if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Sushiholic was great! We ordered a number of rolls and they were all delicious, the fish was fresh and tasty and the combinations were fun. Our waitress was attentive and friendly, and the decor was really cool. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Small venue, always a table available and hip. I love the matcha green ice tea and a rainbow roll. If it says \"spicy\" it's probably not otherwise the food is very good. I've always had a good service too."}
{"text":"Oh ya sooooo good go here NOW!!! Take ur family here, ur girlfriend, or whoever... just go NOW! So good!!"}
{"text":"Great product (the fish is quality), great service, perfect atmosphere for casual dining and extremely reasonable prices. Sep is one of our family's favorite, he always has great recommendation, extremely attentive, and has a great personality. He tries to mix it up and suggest something new based on our taste preferences and cake out with this, the Sep Spectacular! It was an amazing rendition of sashimi, seaweed salad, and cucumber tuna and salmon rolls. On top of all the above they always seem to have fun happy hours and offer an extensive selection of sake also at an extremely reasonable price! I wish the picture I'm sharing was at least a pinch as good as this place is and the dish itself. I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The sushi is very fresh and never disappoints! The staff is very nice. They have lots of specials: lunch, happy hour and reverse happy hour. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite sushi spots in Phoenix. Their happy hour is amazing and they have great food. We always leave dinner with 4-5 rolls, apps, drinks and it's under $100. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I LOVE SUSHI! Finally gave Sushiholic a try after hearing lots of good things from friends. It was worth the wait! Great menu, and I love that their happy hour runs from 2p-8p. Their fish is fresh, and the cuts are generous. Beware though, the spicy garlic edamame is spicy! I'd recommend just getting the garlic and adding your own sriracha. But if you like spicy, then have at it! The service was friendly and efficient. We will definitely be back. Happy to have found a new spot to add into my sushi rotation."}
{"text":"What?  I haven't reviewed this hit yet?  Best bet for a great Bento in all of Phoenix. So many choices to include in your box. I tend toward the Teri Chicken but the Chicken Katsu is always crispy crunchy goodness too!  You get a full selection of sushi roll of your choice with your meal. Love!"}
{"text":"You need to try this place. They pretty much have deals all day; lunch specials, then happy hour from 2pm-8pm, then to finish off the night 8pm-close reverse happy hour. My boyfriend and I can each get a drink, 4 rolls, and edamame for around $40. The quality here is also great. The sushi always tastes fresh and comes out so fast. My favs are the spicy salmon roll, Cali roll, Tutsi maki, and (off the happy hour menu) the New York roll. For apps if you like spicy try the spicy garlic edamame soooo good. I would eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"I love Sushiholic! The sushi is always fresh and delicious, the staff is amazing, and our favorite sushi chef is Rafael :) I highly recommend this place, been coming here for years and it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing happy hour prices. 4 rolls, 3 appetizers, and a noodle dish for about $40, well worth that, as it tasted wonderful. Happy hour goes everyday until 8pm."}
{"text":"Ridiculously fresh sushi! Great staff and a wonderful atmosphere. Some of the best sushi I've had in Arizona and they have gluten free soy sauce. They are new, yet already mighty. This will definitely be my go to sushi spot from now on."}
{"text":"Happy hour 2-8pm with really good sushi! I had a drink called Botox something that I didn't really like, but I enjoyed the sushi."}
{"text":"Best place ever. Happy hour all day, great prices for quality food. I'd eat here everyday."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good place to eat sushi since coming to Arizona and have not found one until I ate here. I had the booty roll, lobster bake, dragon roll and teriyaki chicken and tempura plate. The chicken was a little dry but otherwise everything was great and I will come back again."}
{"text":"Great spot love the Arcadia area in Phoenix. This is a great spot in the center of it. Happy Hour is extensive, went there for dinner with three people had what should be considered as too much food and some adult beverages for $60. Sushi was good, great selection of specialty rolls. Restaurant is not huge which is something I like, but the make great use of the space and set up in a way that makes it feel much larger. Smaller physical space make the place feel lively maybe could be considered loud. Great for large and small groups alike. Staff was nice but seemed very busy and maybe a little under attentive at times."}
{"text":"Exceptional sushi quality and variety. Excellent service and great atmosphere. I would highly recommend...in fact, if I wasn't so full, I would want to go right back!"}
{"text":"Samantha our waitress was awesome! She suggested great drinks and was quick to get around to us even though it was pretty busy. For 2 Cali girls on a business trip looking for a good place to spend the afternoon, this was a great choice.  Sushi was fresh and yummy, drinks were flavorful and strong, and the atmosphere was perfect."}
{"text":"Wow, I feel like the reviews on this website were highly overrated. I was expecting some of the best Sushi in Phoenix and was a little disappointed to find out that it was just \"okay.\" I had the baked scallop roll and it was loosely rolled and falling apart...just very messy. Even the basic Philly roll seemed as though the fish was not the freshest. The miso soup was very salty I did not finish it. The customer service was very good though...however, when I come back to Phoenix to visit i will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great little spot for creative sushi rolls. We ordered a seaweed salad, squid salad, salmon nigiri and a couple of the specialty rolls. Everything was fresh and really good. Very polite service. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This sushi shop surprised my wife and I with the quality of the squid and the rolls. The price is also very reasonable for the quantity of food they give. We will be back"}
{"text":"I used to be addicted to conveyor-belt sushi.  Now I'm a Sushiholic sushiholic.    Sushiholic has a few major things going for it.  The fish is fresh and buttery.  They have REAL wasabi (!!), one of the few places in the valley to have this upon request.  My favorite thing, though, is the double happy hour.  Not only do they have a normal happy hour, they also have a reverse happy hour.  If you miss out on one, you still feel like you're getting a great financial deal on some cheap, fresh sushi.  I'm a huge bargain shopper when it comes to food (restaurant weeks and happy hours FTW!), and this sales tactic just makes me happy.  I know it's a trick.  I don't care.  Definitely will be back next time I need a post-shift sushi fix."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch today at Sushiholic!  Arcadia has been missing good sushi since Zen 32 closed down.  They have great lunch options including a bento option, an all sushi option and a udon noodle bowl option -- each for about $9.  I know for certain that the bento and sushi options come with miso and salad.  I had the bento with salmon teriyaki, a spicy tuna roll and crab puffs.  Everything was absolutely delish!  Fresh, clean food that is filling without making you feel stuffed.  It was a great amount of food for $9!    Carla, the manager, is an absolute delight!  She was very welcoming and offered suggestions (the crab puff was her suggestion and it was really good!).  They also have happy hour prices on their sushi from 3-7pm.  I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"My new fav happy hour spot!! I feel like I'm constantly looking for a happy hour that goes past 7... and this is it!  We had some rolls and apps, and all was super yummy! Drinks felt a little sweet, but I think that's normal. Only downfall was there was not one open spot in the parking lot.... but, it was a Friday night. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Quality sushi for the price!!! Love coming here for Happy Hour!  Keep up the great work Sushiholic!"}
{"text":"Absolute favorite sushi place to go to. It's within walking distance from my aunt house. I love the tootsie roll they have. I chose the Bento Holic with the beer teriyaki, spicy crab roll, and crab puff. Could never get enough sushi."}
{"text":"Cool spot for late night sushi. Fairly decent sized HH menu, late night HH from 8-midnight. $3-4 for a cucumber or seaweed salad, nice generous portions & very fresh. $4 classic rolls (ie California, Spicy Crab, Tuna, or Salmon, Tootsie), $5 specialty rolls including Shrimp Tempura, Philly, Las Vegas, Volcano, just to name a few. Otherwise, HUGE roll selection. Way too many to name! Several cooked dishes as well, and over a dozen sakes. Pretty good music too. Definitely a spot to check out!!!"}
{"text":"Had an entire meal and drinks sitting at the bar. I could of made the sushi better at home. Then wanted one more roll to go and they charged me 50% more since I was taking it to go. Complained buy they didn't care. Absolutely horrible customer service and the sushi is nothing special. No clue why this place is rated high."}
{"text":"This is probably the only place where I was denied entry to a restaurant ever! It was my mother's birthday and we came over  to have a good time but the manager denied serving us, they would only served us if we spent at least 2,000. The food is probably good but I couldn't tell since they denied serving us. Sad."}
{"text":"We've been here twice, both times the food was outstanding. We have nigiri and simple rolls. The fish is fresh and bright, with a clean taste. Whoever marinates the mackerel is doing a spectacular job - well balanced, slightly briny but not \"pickled\". The rice is PERFECT!! I am particular about sushi rice - it has to be the right temp, the right balance of vinegar and sugar, the right consistency....so good! We've had the spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll - simple, well prepared and delicious. The restaurant been slammed busy both times so the servers have to hustle but we've had great service with a smile and really enjoyed the food :)"}
{"text":"Early Happy hour Friday. Ordered cucumber salad, crab puffs, fried shrimp. Salad perfect, crab puffs delicious, shrimp fresh and tasty, could have been a bit crispier. 3 different rolls, honestly, they pretty  much tasted the same. Nothing bad, but undistinguished. Nice place, clean, felt right. Friendly service. With Happy hour prices, good value and pretty good food. We will return!"}
{"text":"Excellent find! My first time here. Came in for a take out during lunch wich they packed on ice. Customer service was fantastic. Cant find the words to describe how pleased I was. Its out of my way due to taking the bus, but I will so be back. Prices were well below what I expected for the amount of food. $9.75 was it. Ate most of it on bus going home"}
{"text":"We were nearby and craving sushi. I had my 2 sons and my daughter who is in a wheelchair. The entryway and doors are extremely small and there was no way to have my son hold them open so I could get her chair in. The host at the podium just stared while I struggled to figure out how to get in. Finally did it and realized there was nowhere in the packed restaurant to put her chair. The tables are packed in tight in a narrow building. We left and I doubt we'll ever return- chair or not. Very disappointed since we were so excited to try this place out. Bummer."}
{"text":"We arrived back in Phoenix last night and decided to try Sushiholic. We walked in around 7:30 and got a table pretty quickly for a Saturday night.  First to note, the restaurant is very cute and trendy inside, and also very clean. We were greeted quickly when we walked in too, all the employees were very friendly.   They have a pretty big menu, we decided on the monkey brain appetizer, a spicy crunchy tuna roll, the crunchy roll, the school bus roll, and the crazy horse roll. Everything was absolutely delicious!! Our server was awesome too, it was a great relaxing delicious dinner to end a long day of driving.  Great food, great service, great atmosphere, and great prices. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"These guys are great.  I work across the street and they have fantastic lunch options.  They are very nice.  Fish is fresh and fantastic.  I love the noodles.  Highly recommended.  Just what we need in this area."}
{"text":"If i'm going to be any kind of 'holic, I might as well be a Sushiholic.  Be careful, after you make your visit here, you too may walk out addicted to their fresh tasting sushi.  Here's the deal with raw seafood, it's either fresh or its not.  In this context, as close to freshness as fresh can be.    To clarify on this so-called \"fresh\" I speak of, I mean fish that is taken out of the back canal of Phoenix and sliced artistically at the Sushi counter and served right away upon your order.  No, I was just kidding.  The most simple way to know you are eating the perfect piece of sushi is how much chewing you are doing.  The less chew, the better.  If your jaw is about to break or starts to sore, it's no bueno.  Another thing to look for is how vibrant the color is and how smooth looking it is. In conclusion, Sushiholic does sushi the right way.  I heard somewhere in the Yelp land that they also make some delicious bowl of Ramen.  So I opted for that and I did not regret it.  The broth was simple with the porky, \"tonkotsu\" consistency you would expect from what is considered a traditional Ramen broth.  If you are in the mood for something hot and yummy, you can't go wrong with it.  Especially, if you live in the Arcadia area, this would be the go to spot.  There can be a wait on weekends but don't let that deter you, it might be worth your time to wait 20 minutes or so.  Beyond that, I wouldn't wait much more.  If I was in the area and craved some sushi, Sushiholic certainly is a place I would return to."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have ever had and their miso soup is amazing! Not like dirty dish water!"}
{"text":"First of all, food and price are Amazing. However past few time I came here for lunch, the service kinda suck specially today. Came here for lunch. After sited down with a menu, my server just leave me there over 20 min.  Noted that I came there after lunch rush and so they can't use being busy as an excuse. Anyway. Wasted my time end up  order my food to go."}
{"text":"I love this addition to the neighborhood. The sushi is fresh and affordable. They have great happy hour prices. The restaurant is cute but a little crammed. They stuffed too many tables in such a small place. I'd definitely give this place a try if you're in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"Sushiholic is a solid sushi spot for the Arcadia area. It is right across the street from my office, so it has become a staple in my weekly food adventures.  I really love their happy hour- they have great deals on sushi rolls, raw sushi, and even other food! I met my boyfriend here for lunch a few weeks ago and he got a combination box. There was so much food in there- chicken, rice, salad, cream cheese wontons, an orange! I can't believe how much food you get for the price!  I have had their raw tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. All were excellent. They also do take-out very efficiently and fast. Every time I have called an order to-go I get it super quick within fifteen minutes! Woohoo!  If you like raw fish, you will definitely like their sushi. If you want to grab a bite with someone who isn't a raw fish connoisseur then bring them here- they have plenty of other tasty options as well!"}
