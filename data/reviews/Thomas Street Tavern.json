{"text":"Compared to a lot of the places I've been in the QC, Thomas Street delivered almost exactly what I expected when I walked in the door for the first time.  The best two comparisons I can come up with is either a college type bar / pub or a drinking bar.  This is the type of place you can take that one friend who is a klutz when drinking and not worry .  From the looks of it the floor and walls and every thing else in the bar has had worse done to it than having a few drinks spilled.    Prices for drinks were fantastic!!  You will not be paying $6-$7 a beer here, even for micro brews.  Staff -  They honestly looked bored the night I was in.  I really couldn't blame them.  They looked like they are used to really moving and hustling when busy and they certainly weren't this night.  Compared to a lot of the crappy service I've had here in Charlotte this was above average.  Food - Standard and some glorified bar food, served in 50's style plastic baskets w/ wax paper.  If you forgot to eat before drinking or need something to soak up the excess alcohol afterward this will serve it's purpose.  If you're looking for a great meal, I'd look elsewhere.  There are Flat screens every where and plenty of other bar activities to keep you busy.  I'd definitely pay a visit again, I'd just eat first elsewhere."}
{"text":"Huge patio, lots of games, it's a fun dive bar to spend some time with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place solely on the patio.  There's plenty of space to hang out with your friends and they have a late night menu.  It is always nearly impossible for me to find a server to take my order, but once I do everything is fine.  Other than the slight frustration of needing a server in this place the drinks and food are good.  I'd say go here when it's not too busy, you'll enjoy it more.  Unless you like that packed in a can like a sardine kinda thing."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a bar that serves beer, this place is exactly what you're looking for.  Everything else about it is mediocre.  In closing, there seems to be no time limit imposed on the ping-pong tables once a pair has claimed lordship."}
{"text":"I would rate Thomas Street 3.5 stars.  This is an awesome place to buy a drink and gather with friends and family.  There is a nice patio area in the back where you can play table tennis or corn hole.   I have been going to Thomas Street for several years and have found their food to be good one day and not so good the next. Management really should step up to the plate to make sure their food is consistantly good.  Super nice group of locals/regulars."}
{"text":"Thomas Street has been my go to bar for as long as I've lived in Charlotte.  I can't begin to summarize the good memories from this place.  Good folks, interesting crowd, can't beat it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Charlotte. It's super laid back, and actually reminds me a lot of a San Francisco bar (where I live now). There's a varied crowd, which is nice compared to a lot of the bars in the downtown area that tend to attract the same types of people. Cheap beer and out back they've even got a series of ping pong tables, complete with stadium seating so that you can watch game after game."}
{"text":"Friendly hang-out, great staff.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Good food, good service at the front bar, typical hole in the wall in the back/outside."}
{"text":"Great food, but stinks like cigarette  smoke. Decent prices, bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I stopped by last Saturday to try out the kitchen.  It took forever to get someone to take our order after we had to physically seek our own server. The wait for food was longer than expected but the food wasn't that bad.  The guy:girl ratio seemed like some where on the line of 80:20.  U can actually see guys in line for the restroom rather than girls which is weird.  Overall I would recommend this place for a late night grub session and a good change of scenery to hang out with friends.."}
{"text":"This bar is great love that beer I heard bitch n dudes were playing tonight so bet your bottom dollar I'll go back to this tavern"}
{"text":"Great place, good food. I really like the back patio area/bar."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. I ordered a turkey burger with a side of fruit. Also, I had buffalo wings as my appetizer. My food was fresh and delicious. The service was a bit slow. I will return again."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are nice. Everyone fits in here and it has a home-y vibe. Only thing is they can get a bit busy and it can take a long time to get a drink, but they make up for those instances by making good drinks and being decent people."}
{"text":"if there was a fool-proof way to keep all the god foresaken yuppies out of this place i might go there every night.  since that doesnt seem to be an option i stick to wednesday/thursday nights.  if you are a drunk like me and the slapasses i associate with then you will enjoy drinking there during the day on saturdays as well.  decent bar food, cheap whisk, ping pong, epic patio = good enough for me.  p.s. i drive a tahoe and wear polos"}
{"text":"I went there for World Cup game and the service was lousy. The staff took a VERY long time to get us a round of drinks (even when factoring for the extra World Cup crowd). Additionally, the staff was a little off-putting when we sat down at a booth and they had to clean a booth up for us. Overall I would not go back there as several bars in the area cater much better even during peak hours."}
{"text":"Frat Boys and Hipsters. All are welcome. This is a hodgepodge or ridiculousness and it makes it that much more fun. Huge outdoor patio with Cornhole and Ping-Pong tables (if you can ever get to them) and an outdoor bar to keep your mind at ease. It does get crowded pretty much any day the weather is nice. And for some reason a random mosh pit/ dance party mix up has developed every time I have visited the patio... Not a complaint, just an observation. Cathy has always been at the patio bar when I have visited and always does a killer job. Food is standard bar fair. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but def a good place to drink and relax... or dance if you feel so inclined. Only downside are the bathrooms. Ill suffer with the bathrooms for the patio."}
{"text":"Thomas Street Tavern has become my go-to Plaza Midwood bar -- great patio space, cheap drinks, outdoor games, interesting clientele, and solid bar food.  I didn't know they served food until last night, but man, what a pleasant surprise!  I was expecting the worst because---let's call a spade a spade---Thomas Street is a dive.  The menu is as random as the clientele, but mostly consists of sandwiches.  I had the chili nachos, cheese fries, and BLT with fries (take your judgment elsewhere, it was my cheat meal).  It was all really delicious in the greasy bar food kind of way.  And it was all really cheap.  That being said, the service was kind of shitty.  There was one waitress for the entire patio and she was just so over it... or possibly on drugs.  Like I said before, the clientele is interesting, which is both a good and bad thing.  Sometimes interesting means funny and cool; sometimes interesting means super hillbilly and creepy.  I find that you can generally avoid the latter type of interesting by staying in the patio/fire pit area, as they tend to congregate around the pool tables and outside bar.  Also great for nights when you just don't feel like wearing big girl/boy pants.  Nobody here will think less of you for wearing sweatpants and flip flops."}
{"text":"I love this bar & the family that runs it. It's my home away from home. My favorite wings in town, love the ribs on Sundays, chantilly wedge & Beth's jersey are my fav sandwiches. The setup of the entire place is perfect. The back patio can be quite a party, so sometimes chillin on the front patio can be nice/relaxing. Depending on your mood. Take care of the staff & they definitely take care of you. Hefty pours on the drinks for a great price. One of my favorite things about T St is the jukebox. I'm not a fan of the expensive internet jukebox with any kind of music on it. Theres a great variety of music in the jukebox. The back patio is great for all seasons. I'm a smoker, so sometimes on the weekend when I get out of my other job ill hangout all the way in the back at the tiki bar. I can smoke freely there, and it's usually less crowded on a weekend night. It's a cash bar, so be sure to have cash. The weekends get pretty busy. There's always entertainment with the crowd there, never a dull moment. So many different walks of life come in/out of there. Everyone is welcome. Love the diversity.  This place is a fantastic neighborhood watering hole. One of my favorite places in charlotte for sure!"}
{"text":"Thomas Street Tavern has a great atmosphere and is really a very cool place to go to but the prices are definitely NOT cool. I went on my birthday a few weeks ago and was pretty disappointed in the drink prices and the bartenders. They were really not very friendly and wouldn't even recommend any drinks to us. Definitely a great atmosphere but not worth the $$"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Charlotte from LA, and were looking for a good bar to grab some drinks, some food, and some fun, and we were not disappointed at all. We found the back patio, and had a great time drinking well priced beer and playing ping pong. Dinner was also great. I had the crab cake sandwich on a croissant, and it was delicious.   Sounds like when it's super busy the service get bad, but we were there early on Friday, and had no trouble getting drinks and service with a smile."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Thomas Street Tavern, in part because it's a great atmosphere, and also because it's right across the street from the Penguin.  Can you get any better?  Fried pickles at the Penguin and then beers and ping pong at Thomas Street?  No, didn't think so.  Relatively cheap prices on their beers and a big selection is one of the main reasons we keep coming back here.  The last couple times they've been out of this beer or that, have to wonder if they have problems keeping their bar stocked or if they just have that much of a crowd.   Wait staff has always been good and friendly; quick with the beers or a recommendation.  The only thing I don't like is the creepy guy that tried to pop pills into my friends mouth.  You know who you are, creepy guy with dreadlocks."}
{"text":"Good spot in Plaza Midwood.  The scene is very chill and the wait staff is down-to-earth.  I liked the back deck and super ping-pong area.  They also have pool tables inside.  I didn't check out the food menu, but the front patio was packed with diners.  Beer selection was moderate, with quite a few options on tap.  Not a \"scene\" place in my mind and great to go with some friends to have an enjoyable evening with light activity."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Charlotte, because of the atmosphere and the ping-pong tables outside.  Perfect for cool summer nights and really any season in Charlotte except for when its raining.  Decent beer selection, but nothing spectacular...like I said its the atmosphere of Thomas Street that makes it so cool, everyone is just there to chill, drink, meet up and have a good time.  The stadium seating near the ping-pong table adds to the unique attitude of this bar and when the competition heats up you can feel it throughput the lower part of the outdoor bar.  When the temperatures dip south they have fire pits in some of the outdoor tables as well as the traditional stand alone outdoor heaters. So come outside, drink a beer and gaze at the stars, and feel the vibe of Thomas Street; my favorite bar in Charlotte, it's unpretentious and straight -up chill so come kick it, if it isn't already ridiculously crowded...if it is... head up the street to P-Stone."}
{"text":"I've been to Thomas Street Tavern a few times and have enjoyed myself for the most part.  They have a nice outside setup with plenty of places to sit or stand, a second bar with seating of it's own, and ping-pong tables.  It's a great place to hang out to meet new people, or go with a group of people.  It seems to be a very \"chill\" place and completely non-hostile.  They offer a nice variety of beers on tap at a fair price.  I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go in Charlotte. The drinks are strong and the people are friendly. Some of the food is pretty damn good too. They definitely have the best patio in the city & the fact that it's open year round is awesome. They have games to play & watch."}
{"text":"This place is a quick walk across the street from Penguin In. I went with friends and we sat in the back. I was more impressed with this place than I thought I would be. I'm not sure what it would be like full - we went on a Tuesday night - but it looks like it could be fun.   My friends and I all ordered Blue Moon beer. The newly pregnant one ordered a Shirley Temple and got a hint of an eye roll from the server. Even so, we loved our server - he was attentive and friendly, checking back often to see if we were doing alright.   It was cold that night, so I couldn't talk the group into going outside to enjoy the fire on the patio. However, if and when I go back, I will certainly check it out. I love the stadium seating out there.    think the layout of this place was the most impressive to me. They have a front patio where dogs can hang out too, then you walk into a long bar where I'm sure the regulars sit, then a seating area on the ground level leads to the back where more tables are available on a raised platform. Couple this with the back patio and its ping pong action, and you've got yourself a really friendly neighborhood bar worth coming home to."}
{"text":"Yeah, I come here when I feel like having drinks spilled on me by a bunch of annoying frat guys.  Which is never."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I wanted to order food at 1230am because no where else was open with food for panthers championship and a bartender was eating a splice of pizza while serving my drink. Taking her greasy hands and throwing her crust into the dish pit where dirty cups went, I've lived in Charlotte for 3 years... Grossest experience I've had."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Thomas st tavern. They have pretty good quality \"bar food\" and their specials are usually pretty good as well. The staff is awesome too and even though the bar can get slammed at times they keep up the pace and make sure you get served in due order. To be honest, I'm not sure how they keep it up but they manage. Also, I love that they have fooseball, pool, ping pong and even cornhole. Just gives you more activities to partake in while you enjoy some food or their reasonably priced drinks."}
{"text":"One of the most fun relaxing places in town  I love it here! Great drinks and great food  Excellent nachos !"}
{"text":"Best fries in charlotte. The chicken philly is always delicious. Wait staff is nice and efficient."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome set up on the outside patio but the service is terrible!! Waited twenty minutes before walking to bar to ask for service only to be ignored again. Waiters kept walking by, saw us and ignored us. When asked for menus the staff acted as if it was an inconvenience. Would come here more often if the staff had a positive attitude and actually made us feel welcome. The bartenders are also inconsistent in their mixing. First drink was entirely too strong, next one was watered down. Would not recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"I give Thomas Street a 5 star rating because it is one of my favorite bars and I've been coming in for years! I love it."}
{"text":"What impressed me the most was the fast service with having so many customers. Great customer service!! Food was very tasty, of good quality, great presentation and reasonably priced. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Thomas Street Tavern on Thomas Avenue, lol.  I'm not sure whether to give this place 5 stars or 3, so I guess 4 will work.  It has a lot of potential.  One of the few places that has had bar games for quite some time.  They have a full bar and plenty of good beers.  A very nice back deck to boot.  Parking is deplorable and I just don't always get along with the crowd, though.  I've walked right through the front patio but have never actually sat there.  I should, would be great people watching.  Once you walk through that area you enter through the doors and into the main bar area.  There is a bar on the right, pool and foosball on the left, and seat yourself dining in the back.  They are normally pretty quick with the food service if thats what your looking for.  If you walk past all that you get to the ping pong tables, cornhole, and other bar area.  That's where you'll normally find me.  The food is pretty good, but its always been a side note for me.  A little better than average bar food.  The chicken nachos are pretty good.  The sandwiches are solid as well.  I'm not that big of a fan of the spinach and artichoke dip.  It is really rich and the toast points aren't really that great.  All in all, its a great place and I see why people go there.  The crowd just isn't always my kind of crowd.  But that could just be me."}
{"text":"I've had many drinks here...  I've yelled at people whilst they played ping pong from the novelty bleachers sitting behind the ping pong tables.  I've played ping pong.  I've had drinks (did I already say that?)"}
{"text":"Thomas Street is so fun in the warmer months! They have a HUGE patio with ping pong tables, picnic tables and an outside bar. Sometimes they have a DJ or live music outside on busier nights. The staff is really hip and cool and it's a great place to hang out with friends and run into other peeps you know as well.   I've only eaten here a couple times at lunch and the food is pretty good but I personally enjoy just hanging here for drinks. There are also other bars within walking distance so it's a great place to start a fun weekend night or get some sun on a Sunday Funday!  Special tip: There are 3 restrooms inside the restaurant and 2 of them are typically designated for the ladies so the lines are always really quick for females, which is awesome! Also, the potty rooms have huge chalkboards on the wall so patrons have fun doodling notes to their friends and other random peeps who use the facilities. Totally random but FUN! Like the ladies need MORE things to do while in the restroom. ;)"}
{"text":"You have to love this Charlotte classic. Way laid back, killer patio. Cold beers and a casual place to chill all day."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends to celebrate my birthday and had a really nice time. The place was packed!  Since it's been an unusually warm December we were able to sit out on the patio....my goodness! It's pretty awesome back there. There's tons of room for you to mingle with folks and the bartender sure knows how to make a mean drink! :)   If you're in the area I'd absolutely recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"My wife & I love this place! the staff is very friendly and the bar crowd is great. They have a awesome outdoor area with a bar. So when the weather permits check out the outdoor area."}
{"text":"Asians dominate the ping pong table here. GREAT entertainment! My drink had a fly with the Zika virus, but the waitress traded out with a free one with extra vodka! Really recommend dis place if you looking for Olympic activities like table tennis while trashed on sugar free redbull vodkas."}
{"text":"Still the best local neighborhood around. Any day of the week holds a decently great crowd. Hats off thomas.."}
{"text":"Awesome outdoor area! Tons of space, ping pong tables, fire pit tables ... over all a great place to come out for a night of fun with your friends. Great location in Plaza Midwood, right next to other great bars if you're a bar hopper."}
{"text":"Ok I admit I was skeptical because, next to Penguin Drive-in, this is the most talked about place in Plaza Midwood.  But it does have a very mellow, \"hey relax\" vibe.  The bartenders are attentive and friendly.  And for an added bonus they have a pretty good Scotch selection.    Thomas Street Tavern reminds me of gringo bars in Mexico that are a little bit out of the way but if you ask the right people or poke around enough, you'll inevitably wind up here.  Slightly eclectic crowd, cabin fever locals, musicians who are off the clock, road worn travelers.  And everyone there just wants to get away from the fray, not too loud, be casual, mingle and leave everything else behind...  The juke box could use some more choices, but all in all a decent Friday night bar where you could spend a good long time decompressing.  Don't dress up and don't eat here."}
{"text":"This place has a lot going for it. Great staff of friendly people serving food and drinks. The outside patio is a great place to congregate in the afternoon to have a drink and play some games. The place is very laid back and casual, we felt right at home.  A nice selection of daft beer is available at the outside bar."}
{"text":"I love Thomas Street it's the  perfect place to enjoy a cocktail in the great outdoors.  They have a huge patio outside with heaters and firepits as well as an outdoor bar.  not to mention pingpong, cornhole, and more. The bartenders are always friendly and I always meet a bunch of friendly patrons.  Food is above average for bar food and there are plenty of options to choose from even a few veggie options.  Overall just a great casual place to hang with some friends."}
{"text":"I'm not typically one to just head out to a bar and have a couple beers with friends. I'd most likely pick one of Charlotte's premier breweries or even a passable taproom/pub over any bar/watering hole in town. Buuuuuut....throw in a couple of ping pong tables and I'm hooked. I'll hold a paddle and slam backhands all night long, regardless of where it is, with a grin from ear to ear. Heck, if there were a pingpong table at my wife's nail salon I'd go every time.   Thomas Street is a great dive-y bar to meet up with some friends for some sub-par grub and plenty of foamy brews. I've eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed a good greaser or hoagie. Hey Oh, heartburn! It's always worth it, though, isn't it?   Best part about this joint is the back patio. Not much to shake a stick at in the winter time or if the sun isn't shining on a Saturday afternoon, but when it's right, this place is the crown jewel of hangouts on Thomas Ave. Cornhole, plenty of bench seats, tables, draughts outside, and many a lively 20-something enjoying it all the same. Again, ping pong tables? Count me in. Note: it can be rather difficult to nudge your way in line to grab a game. Kindly ask bro-ho du jour for next game and you should be good.   Thomas Street Tavern is an easy go-to if you're in the Plaza area. A mix of entertainment and space make easy for a revisit."}
{"text":"Undercooked fries, burger was okay - not nearly as good as our local Sports Page -  Service forgot to bring drink refill for whole meal and we had to get menus from table next to us. Horrible - wont be back"}
{"text":"Good food, good brews, good crowd....and a patio with ping pong.  The Thomas St. Taven is a staple of the Plaza Midwood bar scene.  In fact, if you don't prefer a certain scene for a bar (i.e. hipster, dive bar, biker bar, etc), you'd like this place.  The clientele is mixed; black white, straight, gay, college age and cougar alike find a home here.    They have Stella Artois on tap and a couple of atypical beers on special.  The patio is awesome, even in the winter when they pull out heaters.  The tavern gets kinda packed in the summer months...so if you don't mind the crowd, you're in for a treat."}
{"text":"When I lived in Charlotte, this was one of my standard bars, especially on nice summer days and nights.    Inside is a nice bar, a couple pool tables and plenty of seating.  Additionally, they have an extensive outdoor area with two more bars, tables and benches for sitting and ping pong tables for fun drinking activity.  There is also a front side patio for outdoor seating in a more lax atmosphere.  The food is also pretty good.  The crowd is from all walks of life which adds to the intrigue of this bar.  Do yourself a favor and visit this bar, you won't be let down!"}
{"text":"Perfect summertime spot...With that being said, I went here on a cold, windy, Wednesday evening in the middle of November...  I met a few friends here for food and drinks on a weekday night recently.  The food was good, not great - standard bar fare.  I recommend the onion rings.    The ambiance on this week night was a bit dull.  Its not that anything was WRONG, there was just something missing.  I soon remembered that every previous time I'd been to Thomas Street was during the spring or summer time.  I feel like the cold weather has a negative affect on TST.  This is probably because so much about this bar is predicated on its extensive outdoor patio set-up.   I must admit, I feel somewhat bad about this review because I have been here plenty of times on Summer nights and this place has been awesome in every way.  With that being said, its probably best to hibernate away from Thomas Street until the weather warms up a bit..."}
{"text":"Got a quick bite to eat and a beer here for lunch on Sunday during the game.  Quite a few Panthers fans were there (with not a lot of cheering going on...) but the food came out fast, and it was quite good for bar food...I had the chicken club with fries, and had a few of my friends onion rings - the decor was also great, very spacious, I might have to swing by here some evening when it's booming to see the crowd that hangs out here!  I'd definitely recommend Thomas Street Tavern if you are looking for a quick lunch and drink!"}
{"text":"Walked in and ignored by both the bar tender and the server. When we got the server's attention and asked to be seated it seemed like we were interrupting her.   We walked...."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times over the years. This is the first time that I visited during an afternoon. The college bowl games were on the tv's. Bar wasn't as crowded as it is at night which was a nice change. It wasn't loud and tables were available.  Still a pretty cool place to have some beers and watch the game.   They also have an outdoor patio with games.   PMBC Plaza Midwood Bar Crawl December 29, 2017"}
{"text":"The sky was crying thick sheets of rain when I sauntered into Thomas Street Tavern, a loose assemblage of draft and bottled brews, flat screens, and elbow to elbow friends. These guys were bringing them in from all fronts. And while this place was cool enough and the staff was spot-on friendly, it would be surprising to reference this tavern as remarkable.   In the end, I found my way clear to sample a large format hefeweizen and a black ale, and while the skies continued to open up, I settled into a bar stool and some haphazard conversation. Would I return? Sure, I don't know why not -- but it probably wouldn't be because I was craving something original."}
{"text":"Great back patio, despite the rather angry staff.  Apparently it was a bad night for staff at the TST.  It was chilly outside, so there were a couple of tiki torches lit.  We stepped off the porch and down to the patio by the ping pong tables, and there was an unlit torch, so I decided to go light it from the one on the patio myself.  As I was about to light it, someone grabbed the stand, and I wheeled around to see one of the staff with an angry face ask me \"What are you doing? The fire marshal told us yesterday that we couldn't have these, and now you're dripping oil all over the patio.\"  Now I understand that this guy probably has to deal with lots of drunken crazies with pyro fetishes (after all there's a table at the outside bar that has a fire pit in it), and he needs to be firm to get his point across, but I did not at all appreciate that tone when there were clearly other tiki torches lit around the porch, and there was not a drop of oil on the ground under the torch that I was holding.  Ok, whatever, \"I'm so sorry, I'll just sit down\".  Three minutes pass, and the same guy walks out to light the said tiki torch.  He then pats my arm and says \"There you go, honey, your torch is now lit.\"  Please don't touch me, particularly if you don't know me, and you were just reprimanding me with angry eyes.  I know you're trying to make nice, but the touching only makes it creepy.  5 minutes later, a different guy on the patio who was smoking and talking on his cell phone closes his phone forcefully while uttering a choice expletive and walks up to the tiki torch, blowing it out with wet, smoky breath.  He then proceeds to walk up to the porch and blow them all out, and recruit the original employee from my story, and they carry all the now blown-out tiki torches back to the shed where no one can mess with them.  Guess the fire marshal did call.  Whatever, I understand, just wish they'd had their story straight.  So now I'm watching ping pong, and helping retrieve the balls that fall under the net (why bother to have a net if it doesn't go all the way to the ground to catch the balls), and all of a sudden the first employee comes running out with angry eyes to yell at the girl who put her bottle on the table.  Again understandable, but she was not being drunk or belligerent, and it was the first time, for like 2 seconds.  Clearly this guy has had to deal with one too many people and just doesn't care about being hospitable any more.  All that said, I did like this place.  There could have been more heaters out back, but the ping pong, cornhole, and fire pit by bar were awesome.  I would go back.  As long as I wear heavier clothes for the cold weather, and make sure to be on my best behavior."}

{"text":"Thomas Street Taven was one of the first bars I ever went to charlotte. It isuch an awesome place. After spending more time in Plaza Midwood, I started to experience this bar on different nights.    The atmosphere here is amazing. You have a bar inside with tv's, a foosball table, and a pool table.  During the week it begins to feel like cheers where the bartenders remember your name and your drink.  The bartenders actually are pretty cool down to earth people here. The outside section is where this bar shines.  There is plenty of seating with fire pits and another bar outside. They have a net enclosed ping pong area which is always fun trashed, cornhole, and the akward game where you have to get the ring on the hook. This mix of people here is great.  From locals, to hipsters, to college kids, and anyone else in between.    For me if you don't want to go to a club Thomas Street is always an amazing place to go.  There is so much fun things to do outside and the people watching is great.  The bar prices are not expensive at all and there are many other bars to hop to close by.  The food here is acceptable, but I would probably eat somewhere else if I could.  Though the atomsphere is what makes this place shine."}
{"text":"Took a group of 15 for drinks and dinner. Good beverage selection and good menu. Some of us sat outside and others that couldn't take the heat stayed inside to dine. They had good food and service. Outside was a slightly different experience.    I was first concerned when I noticed the waiter did not write anything down. It took 30 minutes to get the first appetizers. At that point I as about the chips and guacamole with no response from waiter. After 10 more minutes he was reminded once again. Another 10 goes by and everyone else was finishing. Still no chips. A friend went inside and asked the waiter again about my order. After another 5 minutes it finally arrived. Had to eat fast as everyone was ready to go. Only got to eat half due to time constraints. A good waiter would have comped the order. Not this one. So I think the problem I have is strictly with the waiter and not the restaurant. I will go back and give it another chance. Sometimes you just have to write it off as a bad experience."}
{"text":"Fun place to go with friends when the weather is great because there patio is amazing. So many games like ping pong and ring the nail. They have multiple bars but it still can be difficult to get a drink when its really packed. The bartenders are fabulous :)"}
{"text":"Thomas Street Tavern has quickly become my favorite bar. The best way I can describe the scene is eclectic. It's awesome to have all types of people in one place who just enjoy having a good time. The bartenders are always personable and make pretty good drinks that are priced pretty well. On the inside you'll find a busy pool table and live music on certain days. The real fun is out back though. Fun times playing corn-hole and ping pong."}
{"text":"I really like the patio with the outdoor bar, seating, and ping pong tables.  It would be great if the non-smoking laws that apply indoors, would carry over to the patio.  We all have to share the space and chain smokers significantly diminish the fresh air quality and appeal of the establishment.  I understand that it is outside, however the patio is a confined and dedicated space for ALL patrons. We should not have to be subjected to the decisions of the smokers."}
{"text":"Thursday night here is hopping and bopping! It's a tight fit into the place but there's tons of stuff to do here! From the ping pong tables where my friend said he could totally pwn all the people there to the corn hole and various other games it was all super chill.  The drinks here can get a bit expensive though. My friend had 2 margaritas and the tab came out to $25!! What?! I am kind of used to $6-10 margaritas. I went with the eternally girly Malibu bay breeze and it was fairly decent on pricing.  This place is a cool place for chilling with your bros and girlfriends but I think I'd recommend pregaming at home or Common Market down the street before heading here and hitting up the games and keeping your drink orders to a minimum."}
{"text":"I wish I could say I have had the food here but I always come late night. The bartenders are amazing and friendly. On the busiest nights I always feel taken care of. I especially love all the casual seating in the back. So much fun in the back with ping pong, ring toss, corn hole and casual conversation! A great meet up spot!"}
{"text":"Bad Food! Nice hang out. Love the outside area and games. Ask for a tall drink and u will enjoy your drink much more for only $3 more bucks. Please sit by the 1st fire pit. Favorite spot on the patio"}
{"text":"Came here on a cold Sunday night looking for a cozy place with good food. My friend recommended the Commonweath Roast Beef sandwich.     I had the sandwich along with house fries, everything was perfect. The roast beef with horseradish and dipping gravy was delicious, and the fries were those great ones like 5 Guys has.   A fun crowd was in, watching the game and enjoying being out.  The patio looked fun, but I'll try that another night.   I like this place, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great day of drinking with friends and enjoyed the almost 70 degree weather in January!! We sat outside, no table service - had to get drinks from outside bar - not a big deal until it started to get a little more crowded. We spent about 5 hours here. Ran into some friends - thought about playing corn hole and ping-pong, but decided not to.   Drinks and shots were reasonably priced.   People brought their dogs - kinda cool, since I am a dog owner/lover.   I would love to go back and try the food."}
{"text":"Decent burgers and pool table.  Not good for large family gatherings.  Cold beer and delicious chocolate cake."}
{"text":"I told Jay H. to take me to \"hipster Charlotte,\" which as far as I can tell is basically like the preppiest part of Atlanta? Friggin' banks. Anyway, this bar is pretty great, as is the area it's in, from the looks of it.  When we first walked in, J headed to the bar to get us some Garlic Ale. I scanned the place: pretty people, but few of them. He handed me a beer and said, \"Here. Follow me.\" We wandered back toward the bathrooms and out into a huge crowd on one of the best bar patios I've ever seen. There's ping pong, there's cornhole, there's another bar. The tables are huge and round, perfect for sitting back and people-watching, which is what we did for the first beer. Then, we moved out to the front patio, which also has tables, to sit and write our creative little ideas on napkins and shuffle cards and sip beer and tell secrets. It was a great place for a Saturday night, and I'll definitely be back to the neighborhood whenever I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love Thomas street for the food, drink prices, choice location, but most of all the clientele.  The plaza midwood crowd is very diverse and very fun.  This is definitley your friendly neighborhood bar, but almost anything you order on the menu will be a delicious choice especially the cuban sandwhich or gargantuan pile of nachos.  You can spend time here on their patio out back, where dogs are welcome, enjoying warm weather and dining al fresca or even at night in chillier temps they have neato fire pits at several tables.  Complete with a table tennis court, cornhole, pool tables, and an extensive bar you will always have something fun to do here day or night. One of my favorite hang outs!"}
{"text":"I love a place that gives a family friendly \"everyone knows your name\" kind of vibe, like Thomas Street Tavern. I also love that there is always people to hang with any time of day, and that the general age group is not the young wiper-snappers :) you also can feel comfortable to bring kids during the day, my teenagers were playing ping pong and other games in a very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"So my friends and I were out exploring the lovely Plaza Midwood area and we told to check this place out. I have to say I was not disappointed. Inside they have pool table, tv to catch the game. What I was impressed with was the outdoor section. It is awesome. Multiple bars, different games set up and plenty of seating. The best part was it was cold (cold for NC) and they had tons of heater so you really didn't feel the chill. I can't wait to it warm up so I can hang out there all summer."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite bars/hangout spots of all time.  Love going to Thomas Street for the awesome atmosphere, good (cheap drinks) and the spacious entertaining back area.  They've got a pool table, ping pong table, heated areas for winter and an outside bar.  Gets kinda crowded on the weekends but that's usually why I try and go on the weeknights.  Definitely one of the more upscale places in plaza midwood."}
{"text":"I'm a disabled veteran with a service animal.  At 9pm on May 6, 2018 a completely inebriated off-work bar manager named Josh got loud and belligerent and shoved me on the back patio.  He took issue with the fact I had a service dog with me, despite the fact that she was properly identified as such to the doorman and I was simply carrying her out back because no one let us in through the side entrance.  The truth of the matter is, the only reason Josh wasn't neutralized at that very moment, IS BECAUSE I HAD THE VERY SERVICE ANIMAL WITH ME HE TOOK ISSUE WITH...    Take-away;  Thomas Street staff has no knowledge of and fails to adhere to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it pertains to service animals and how to respectfully deal with patrons with them.  They also have a douchebag manager that runs off longtime regulars and may just assault you."}
{"text":"Based on reviews I was very under prepared to what this place actually caters too. Given the area I expected a good amount of hipsters, but this is a mix of hipster meets nascar extreme fan. I checked out the back patio which was actually busy during the day on Sunday. Lots of beers and cigarettes out there though. Also, maybe I should've known this, but this is a drink spot not a food spot. Like they only had 1 guy as a waiter for the entire place, inside and outside. The square footage of this place is actually a lot, like maybe 5000? (Total guess.) That's too much ground for one guy if you're at all hungry and going for food. In any case, maybe I did it wrong, but I don't see myself ever going here again. Food was kind of basic. Kind of like the quality you would see at a run down Applebee's, and maybe the same clientele that thinks that's a good date spot. Not saying that's a bad thing, just what you get here. Cheers."}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write a review of Thomas Street given the unfortunate press that has surrounded it lately.  I've been going to Thomas Street for about 2 years now and it has one of the most ecclectic and diverse crowds I've seen in Charlotte.  During the week, you will find a less crowded more chill scene, and on the weekend it is usually packed after 10:30 (but not in a way that makes it annoying).  The outside patio has cornhole, and ping pong tables -  inside there is pool and foozball.    The bartenders are very down to earth.  The drink prices are the best I've seen in Charlotte, and they are poured generously.    This is NOT a club scene, top 40 kind of place.  You will find a juke box with mostly alternative and classics.  Come dressed down, and be prepared to get comfortable and have a great time.  Oh, and if you are leaving the bar solo at night, a bartender or bouncer is always happy to walk you to your car (in fact, they insist!).  There really isn't a bad thing I could say about Thomas Street.  It gets 5 stars because they also allow dogs on the patio :)  *Please note, I reviewed Thomas Street Tavern as a bar, not a restaurant."}
{"text":"Thomas Street is a cool looking place. It has two awesome patios, a smaller one out front and a HUGE one out back. It has a decent beer selection and well-stocked bar. The staff is really good, and even when it's jam-packed you won't have to wait too long to get a beer. The downside to Thomas Street (and it's a HUGE one) is that it's usually packed full of young frat boy, wannabe hipster bankers. Like, people who aren't hip enough for Snug Harbor, but are too cool for the clubs Uptown. If you can get a big enough crowd to \"insulate\" yourself from these morons, it's a good time. Otherwise, be prepared to be surrounded by d-bags."}
{"text":"Best establishment in plaza. Always a wonderful crowd. You can chill on the patio all day and night.  Check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We still love this place. And we love it even more now that we have a dog that we can bring out back. He loves it too. :)  The only negative side to this place is that the kitchen is often pretty slow. But the beer comes out fast, of course. There are two outdoor bars and one indoor one and waiter service. So there's no waiting for drinks at all."}
{"text":"Some nights, Thomas Street is the perfect neighborhood hangout. The large back patio allows you to relax and enjoy the warm weather (or the glow of the heat lamps in the winter). But other nights, it's packed with a snobby crowd that resembles a frat party. Basically, Thomas Street has gotten too popular for its own good.   When I go in, I head straight for the back patio, where there is a separate bar and the smoke isn't quite so thick. The food is OK for bar food, but it typically takes a long time before it arrives. Still, the Ping-Pong is free, and the drinks are cheap."}
{"text":"If we are going to Plaza-Midwood I can almost guarantee we will at least be stopping by Thomas Street.  This is pretty much a great middle of the road kinda bar that has a little bit of everything.  The food is definitely serviceable, (noticeably frozen bar food, but reasonably priced and prepared), the beer selection is decent and the patio is one of the best around.  Ping pong, corn hole, fire pits, multiple outside bars, just overall a great place to spend some time with friends.  Been here so many times and have never had a bad time or really anything to ever complain about.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Laid back, friendly, diverse neighborhood hangout with a great big outdoor patio in the back!   Fire pits, ping pong, corn hole, TV's, pool, foosball, etc.  You can't help but have good timew when hanging out here.  Try it!  DISCLAIMER:  I haven't experienced the food yet...."}
{"text":"This is a default place for my friends. We always find ourselves coming back to \"Thomas\".  With the recent upgrades to the outside area this summer season, this place has only gotten better."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more stars I would it's hands down my favorite bar in Charlotte and the only one I'm regularly at.  Thursday night is the best night it's reggae night, they have a Dj outside in their back area which is definitely the highlight of the bar it's a huge open area with multiple fire pits ping pong tables corn hole and 2 additional bars from the one inside. All the bartenders are amazing but Aleisha is my favorite (hopefully I'm spelling her name right) she always takes care of my boyfriend and I and makes some damn good drinks. The drinks are super cheap compared to other bars in the city but the pours are generous. Any night is a good night to come here but the weekends are a little more busy than I like but they handle the volume amazingly. They also have a great menu and serve food until 2 am anything after 145 is made to go I think, and they have a vegetarian option too! Easy parking on the side of the building and on the streets."}
{"text":"A great option for hip night life. This place has in my opinion the best patio in charlotte. It's a hip spot in the center of Plaza's nightlife. There are also other good bars within a minute walk of here. Great pub food as well. They have a pool table which is always getting used. Two ping pong tables on the patio. A bar inside and both a patio and tiki bar outside."}
{"text":"This is a great place to drink. I'm not too crazy about the food, so I don't come hungry. They do, however , have a great patio with TVs, fire place sort of thing, outdoor bar and and a PING PONG table area with multiple tables, netting and everything: it's serious . A must visit spot in Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"I love Thomas Street Tavern! I've been there several times and have always had great service.  I will say that parking can be difficult but that goes for any place located in the Plaza-Midwood area. It can get very crowded on the weekends but I still manage to get good service.  They have pool tables inside and frequently they have live music. On the nights they have live music they charge a small cover charge.  JT is an awesome bartender.  He always takes good care of me.  They have a bar inside and out back. There are lots of games out on the back patio that can get crowded on the weekend.  All of the food that I've had here is fantastic. My personal favorite is to snack on the cheese fries.  It's definitely a great place to check out in the Plaza-Midwood area and probably my favorite."}
{"text":"I've had the best of times and the worst of times at Thomas Street. I think it has a lot to do with the crowd..if it's a packed-in-like-sardines kind of night, I'm not likely to go in. I don't like the crowd, and the service gets pretty (understandably) sloppy when it's busy. The whole scene reminds me of college a little too much...screaming folks enamored with their own drunkenness...If you're in the mood for college antics, it's a great place to go.  On the other hand, I've had great experiences at Thomas Street during the afternoons. It's good for lunches with friends, especially in the summer with the patio. On evenings when it's not too crowded, the drama at the ping pong table can be pretty intense. (Has anyone else noticed that Charlotte has a weirdly elaborate ping pong culture?)  I like Thomas Street's food, which is solid as far as standard American bar food goes. I'm getting a little old and crochety about big crowds, but overall, it's a safe bet for a good place to go out for night life or for a good dinner."}
{"text":"I always have such a good time here! The drinks are good and priced well. It's more than just a place to grab a drink they have food and games to keep you entertained and hanging out. This is a great place for a low key night out or a painting the town red night out."}
{"text":"Hmmmmm where should I begin? The wings were AMAZING and an UNDENIABLE representation of what chicken wings should be. This was my 1st visit and it is safe to say I will return! I had Teriyaki and it was again AMAZING!   The bartender \"Jacqueline\" is the TRUTH. She handled the bar, placing orders, and with precision she prepared my drinks PERFECTLY!! The atmosphere was welcoming and the people were friendly and Happy drunks!   The music was not up my alley but Hey, after the 2nd drink I didn't mind it at all!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's my go-to watering hole. I think ever major life decision was made in the back of Thomas Street Tavern while sitting around one of the fire pits. Such a local feel, with neighborhood kids of all ages (drinking age of course) and their dogs! Everyone is super friendly and there is normally a corn hole or ping pong game to jump in on. And that fun game with the sting and hook - what is that game??? I don't know but its hours of fun and conveniently located next to one of Thomas Streets two bars in the back area.   You gotta love a bar that takes their live music seriously too - its always good. Its also a pretty rad lace for Sunday football. There aren't enough TVs to watch every game at once outside from one seat but I can't lie to you ... its kind of nice. It causes more banter and chat with soon to be close friends and lets be real - this whole NFL ticket thing is great but slow down! Remember our parents didn't have this luxury. Plus that ESPN app is pretty killer. BUT if you must see all 5 to 7 games from your seat go inside. That big ass screen and all the TVs lining the walls will suit your fancy just fine."}
{"text":"Great spot for a chill and fun night. Outdoor patio and bar is filled with fun games and easy access to bar. Great lighting and layout makes for a carefree night with friends. Always go here when we choose to go out in Plaza."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time last weekend with friends and loved it. The vibe is awesome and everyone was having a great time on the back patio. They have ping pong tables (inside a batting cage-type net so the ping pong balls don't fly all over - genius!), cornhole, and a bar in the back. It's a really chill atmosphere, more like you're hanging in your friends backyard. We brought our three small dogs and had a great time. The wait was pretty long, but there was only one waitress serving the back patio and literally every table was full, so it's not really her fault. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Charlotte. The outside part is so fun and chill, great Sunday funday spot"}
{"text":"I went to the Tavern on a Friday night. They had a cover charge of $5 because of the band that was playing. There was a mixed crowd which is always a good thing. Everyone seemed friendly. The band was amazing! My friend and I had such a great time dancing. I had a couple beers, 4 shots of tequila, and an appetizer for about 36 bucks.  Our waiter was so hot and friendly. In the back, We had a couple good convos with our fellow smokers. Heard the have reggae night on Thursdays I will definitely be checking that out! The only thing that needed attention was the bathroom situation."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to shoot pool and play ping pong, but the service is shabby.  I had to wait forever to order a drink and the bartender wasn't very personal.  However, I went on a crowded Saturday night.  If I went again I would go on a weeknight, so I could participate in some of the games outside.  There is a cute little cabanaesque bar outside on the patio, I would recommend going outside because it is much less congested.  Not only that, the guys who hang out around the pool table are kind of pushy and not really people friendly.  I did get a chance to meet the owner towards the nights end and he was very approachable, and seemed to care about his guests.  Overall, my experience was decent, but a little too frat-tastic for my taste."}
{"text":"Mostly a lunch location for me as I've only been here at night for drinks a couple times.  That being said it's a great bar with a cool vibe and ping pong tables out back.  That's right PING PONG!! I'm a sucker for a good game of table tennis :)  I actually prefer the space outside because of the room and space it affords you so I can't wait till the weather breaks and temperatures drop so I can really enjoy it.  Back to the food.  I have a couple favorites, one being the Chicken Tweety (I think it's called Jessica's Tweety now).  Grilled chicken breast with lettuce and tomato on a toasted hoagie roll with garlic salt butter atop the bread that really makes the sandwich great.  My other favorite is the Johnny Dollar Beach Burger.  Huge burger topped with whatever you like and sure to fill you up, no worries!  They also have an option to build your own sandwich which is great if you are looking to make a veggie sandwich with lots of fresh ingredients.  The decor is full of warm wood and brick accents, I think it actually use to be an old post office? Great location out front with a simple patio space that equates to a good people watching location (my favorite spectator sport)."}
{"text":"Thomas Street is a Plaza Midwood staple. If you don't like it quite frankly you just don't get midwood and probably not be buying or renting all the shittiest condos we don't want here. Hand out in uptown or monford"}
{"text":"I've been to Thomas Street only to drink and hang out-once in the spring and again this past weekend.  I love the firepits and benches with heaters in the back patio.  I also think they have a great bar staff who knows how to handle a busy bar crowd and can get you with a drink in your hand quickly and efficiently.  I was a bit miffed when walking inside this past weekend based on my earlier experience at The Peculiar Rabbit (eyes rolling).....but the vibe at Thomas Street was good enough to put me back in a good mood.  Loved the foosball, too."}
{"text":"Decent late night joint on the same block(across the street actually) from the Penguin. We used to go here when the Penguin was nuts to butts and we couldn't even get in.   Food is decent. A little pricey when compared with Dish(next door) or the Penguin. They have a lot of beers on tap which is always good. There's a decent outdoor area also with booth's, table and chairs, etc."}
{"text":"5 dollar cover for a shit ass suck band. It took 20 minutes to order drinks. No tables. They serve food but will tell you it's more of an after thought when you ask why there's no where to sit. The waitress laughed at us when we asked about eating. ALL mixed drinks are poured in full sized beer mugs!....one shot of vodka and an entire beer mug filled redbull. I asked why such a big cup and she says, \"oh we pour heavy here.\" I says, \"yes I know, you pour heavy on redbull but I needed heavy on vodka!\""}
{"text":"Have been here for drinks a couple times. Finally decided to try the food. After asking for a food menu and getting attitude we left for somewhere else. Sorry if our business was too much of a hassle for you."}
{"text":"Some Russian dude threw ketchup on us. Other than that it was a good thing. Come get tequila shots at the tiki bar."}
{"text":"We love this place!! It was the perfect place to hang out and people watch.  The fire pits in the tables, tiki torches and the ping pong and cornhole games gave this place different vibe than most bars.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We only went for drinks and we really liked it.  Sit outside under the heat lamps and by the fire pit.  We didn't have any food"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Thomas street.  It's a great laid back bar and place to chill and have fun. The courtyard is great during the summer and the fire pits near the back bar are great during the winter. I love playing ping pong and corn hole. Even when the bar is packed, you'd be surprised how short the wait is to play.  The food is decent as well as the service."}
{"text":"Definitely a neat lil bungalow in PM!  (I totally abbreviated it) Walking in there is a great space and plenty of tv's to watch the game or whatever is going on!  For those who are table sharks, the billiards are calling your name... saying \"rack me\"!!!  The food is fantastical for bar food...  And a delicious black bean burger that is awesome!  I recommend the onion rings, they're great!  The atmosphere is awesome as well, with a mix of all types who are welcome!"}
{"text":"Best drinks and prices in town. Ask for Jamie or Katie as your bartenders!! Basically all the bartenders are great though. The wings are the best and they are a great bar to watch Panther and UNC basketball games. The bartenders are very friendly and get to know you if you frequent them often to the point of knowing exactly what you drink and bringing it to you before you even ask. Don't know much about the day time- but the night time atmosphere and staff is great. The outside area is pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"Your standard divey bar, but the outdoor area is complete with games! Bean Bag Toss, washers, and a place for live music. I was there mid-day and just had a drink and there were a handful of other patrons there. Id imagine it gets pretty busy especially in the summer."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to watch the game and hang out for a bit.  It's in Plaza Midwood, so you can't really go wrong with that.  Drinks were good, bartender was cool, outside patio area was well heated (although they showed every game but the Panthers game).  All in all, not bad."}
{"text":"This place, at least on the patio, is pretty cool.  It helped that it was like 80 degrees outside, with a nice little breezy to keep you cool.  There are fire pits, cornhole and 2 ping pong tables with netting around them so the balls flying everywhere don't bother the other patrons.  My only suggestion is to get another cornhole set and get rid of the box around the box.  Didn't have any food, and the bartender outside was SLOW!"}
{"text":"Drop in to catch a game and grab a pop.  The bartender with attentive, friendly, and very helpful.  T he game we were looking for wasn't on but he was nice enough to put it on one of the many TVs.   I ordered the california club which was delicious!  And had a few irresistible $2 PBRs. But the winning quality for me was that they keep the juke box going even when the games are on, which I love, but it could have been pumped up a decibel or few.  They have chalkboard walls in the restrooms but  BYOC (bring your own chalk)  jukebox and pool table near the front.  Awesome back patio with baggo boards, table tennis, and wall hooky.  As well as a fire pit, TVs, two bars and plenty of seating.  fyi - order wings or ribs on sunday and get entered to win a trip to vegas.  We won the package trip and it's not without a catch.... the airfare is 2 for 1 at regular price and the hotel package is sunday - thursday, the $500 in vegas chips is a coupon book to vegas.... so, while it's still super cool to win anything especially an excuse to go to vegas, it's not exactly a free trip to vegas."}
{"text":"Gah! This place is always such a disaster late night. See also, #iamold.   On my most recent visit, I had to elbow my way to the bar and wait forever to order drinks. Beer selection was meh so I went with a margarita. It was sickly sweet -- if I hadn't watched the bar tender pour in tequila, I would have sworn it didn't have any alcohol at all.   After said drinks, I was ready for a visit to the little girls' room. Line for bathrooms stretched almost to the front door. One of the ladies in line with me said it was taking so long because girls were \"doing blow\" in there. If that doesn't capture what a classy place this is, I don't know what else will. Oh, wait! Maybe this'll help convince you... While there, we watched a man being carried out in a head lock by 3 bouncers. He was bleeding from no less than 5 different spots. Once booted to the sidewalk, he stood around literally gushing blood onto the street while the cops that seem to be permanently stationed out front tried to clean him up.   Never again, folks. Never again."}
{"text":"Thomas Street Tavern has an amazing back bar/patio with games and tables as well as pool tables and a good amount of tvs inside. I recommend this place. Good variety of food options. They only have mediocre drink specials that simply seem to highlight what is on the menu but nothing to write home about or really get a good deal. Service is usually great but I have had a few misses as well. They definitely pay attention to locals and return customers!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a solid 10 years. That makes me feel old. It also makes me feel like I am finally a real Charlottean to be able to say that.   The Good: This is a true neighborhood bar. This isn't hipster. It will never be hipster. Thomas St is simply T St. It never changes much- even with the neighborhood changing. You can easily go there and see people from all different walks of life, ethnicity, age and income.   The outdoor area really is the best in Charlotte. I dare you to find one that is more comfortable, welcoming, not pretentious and with a lot of plants (seriously Charlotte- so many outdoor areas here are not landscaped).  There are games galore and plenty of seating. Lots of heaters and fire pits.   This is one of the best spots in the city to watch TV outside. One of my favorite days was watching a game outside under the patio while there was a storm.  The Nachos can be really good (not always), the chicken fingers are highly recommended (especially the honey mustard), the king veggie burrito is a favorite with the vegetarians and the commonwealth roast beef is for the meat eaters.  You can bring your dog!!! (do not walk him through the restaurant- there is usually a gate open in the back. Ask someone to open it if it isn't)  They still have the same crappy Christmas decorations, there are always people willing to play pool (it is very communal- you don't own the table with your BFF- at Thomas St you share), the TV's are usually on mute because this isn't really sports bar. It is more like a neighborhood hang out.   The Bad: T St is not consistent. You might go there and have really good food. The next time you go- meh.   This used to be a fun place on a Saturday night. Now it is a during the week type of a place or during the day. The Friday and Saturday night crowd is really annoying. Think: part busses from University. It turns into a really awkward meat market. Avoid late night on weekend.  The service can be bad. We accept this about T St. In fact, I'm sort of happy that it hasn't changed. Don't get me wrong- there are some really good servers who have been there for years. But there is also a \"I don't care\" attitude that happens. Don't take it personally. It is part of Thomas Street's charm and irritation.   I personally love this place, but it isn't for everyone, nor should it be."}
{"text":"lots of locals lots of liquid lunches lots of drinking and driving."}
{"text":"Thomas Street is possibly the best bar in Charlotte for relaxing on a warm summer night or afternoon. I don't even hold it against them that they took my favorite beer off draft.  The outdoor has two firepits, cornhole, ping pong and that impossible metal circle to nail game. There's a main bar inside, an outdoor bar and a little tikki hut for when it is really busy. The outside area is dog friendly which always makes a bar more sociable.  Every time I've gone the service has been prompt, and the food has been yummy. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place was one of the most interesting bars I've been to! Went here on a Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon to provide you with an honest opinion... This place is hard to find.. If you are not a local or don't know one, you probably wouldn't know about this place since it is out of the tourist area.  Food experience wise.. Saturday evening gets crowded and busy with a small selection of craft beer.  Ordered some chicken tenders tossed in buffalo with a side order of cheese tots!  The chicken tenders were definitely something I was looking for.. They give you a generous portion and do not over bread the chicken before they fry it.  The chicken was tender with every bite.  The cheese totz were good on Saturday night because they were crispy with enough sharp cheddar cheese.  Sunday afternoon the chicken tenders were just as satisfying as Saturday but the cheese totz were soggy and soft.. There was no crunch to it.. And the serving experience on Sunday was terrible.. I had to go find my waitress to order and find her to pay for my bill... Saturday night this gentleman provided my party and I with amazing service and was prompt.  OK... Now what makes this bar so different.. In the back patio there are two tables of ping pong for guests to play, two \"sink and hook\" games, and 2 sets of corn hole games! Saturday night gets really busy so its hard to play corn hole or ping pong and on Sunday there was only one corn hole game out since there wasn't a high amount of requests for it.  Overall, very chill and relaxing bar. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to drink and play games with friends..."}
{"text":"For stars for a great back patio! other than that it's a bar, and a big one. But yea, don't bother staying inside. Nothing wrong with the inside but it's like so many other bars out there. The patio on the other hand is special and worth your business."}
{"text":"I've been here before to get some drinks and don't get me wrong, I've always had a good time here drinking!! Their backyard is to die for. But when my friend and I went in for lunch, it was a completely different story. Joey...the waiter...sucks. He was so angry and when we asked him if he was having a bad day, this was his response: \" Ya. It's 2PM on a Tuesday...I'm here at lunch. I'm kind of ready to go. \" We politely got up and let him know that he didn't have to wait on us and that we'd go somewhere else.  He was in a horrible mood. Why would we want a server like that?? Whiskey warehouse is already 100x better, anyway.."}
{"text":"Add Thomas Street Tavern to the long list of places I've been to numerous times in Charlotte and have still yet to review. But I chock that up to being a few beers deep once I manage to walk out of here.  For a bar in the Plaza Midwood area it's like a household name. Somebody in a group at Common Market without fail will eventually say \"Ya wanna just head over to Thomas Street?\" and you're bound to be there. Another neat point is that this place attracts all types and all ages. I have quite my share of stories...what's with me? I can remember the events but never bring myself up to write a review until now?? Alas, it's been many years since my visit here on one crazy bar crawl night.  The tap isn't huge, so making your decision is quick and easy. It is bigger than your standard sports bar but Thomas Street still manages to maintain that sports bar vibe IMO. So if you're against that, it might not be your place. But, if you can put that aside, there's lots of benefits from being here. Notably: ping pong tables. I love me some ping pong. And what's better than ping pong and beer? I like trying to smash points across the net while waiting for the inebriation to set in. That is, if you can get on a table. You basically just have to step up and say \"me next!\" Inevitably there's always some nerdy dude champing every would-be challenger on one of the two tables. So, prepare to wait. When the weather is nice they will also have a few cornhole boards out. Nothing beats that for a southern night of drinking.  All in all, they have plenty of drink choices to keep me interested. Standard local bar prices - if I remember correctly... Plenty of seating unless it's just a packed evening with some sort of sporting event going on. If you're setting up a bar-hop in the area, this place should be on the list. (No, you may not use the ping pong tables for beer pong.)"}
{"text":"Awesome place for a day drinking adventure or just a good, fun night!! Walking in, this can be extremely deceiving. It's dark wood and somewhat old school. But it has a pool table and some fun games with a small bar in the corner. Where the real fun comes is when you step out back. They have ping pong and corn hole as well as fire pits patio seating and a bar out back. Tons of TVs an they keep this back area pretty heated in the colder months    Overall this is a really cool bar. Locals are often found here as it is situation just outside of downtown. The area has tons of restaurants but Thomas street offers a full menu as well.  a must go if you live in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've lived in the QC on and off for about three years, and I can say hands-down that Thomas Street Tavern is my favorite bar in Charlotte!  There is absolutely nothing to dislike about this place. Walk in and you get that old bar feel, with friendly bartenders to greet you on the right and a pool table on your left. Be sure to order an extremely affordable beer ($4.50 draught everyday!) for yourself. The taps rotate, but yesterday included the Triple-C IPA, Highland Gaelic Ale, Guiness Stout, Noda Midnight Madness, and more.   After you choose a delicious craft brew, keep walking out back and you'll find another bar entirely, TWO Ping Pong tables, and a Cornhole set ready to rock. I spent the better part of last night holding down a table, which is exactly the confidence boost a struggling doctorate student needs every once in a while.   All in all, terrific bar and I find myself coming back at least once whenever I visit home. I've never tried the food, though it always smells like fried heaven. Stay exactly the same, Thomas St Tavern!"}
{"text":"What isn't to love about Thomas Street? They have the best patio ever out back. The food is really good actually. But I love going there for the awesome drink specials and corn hole."}
{"text":"Visited this place on Saturday and it was a pleasant surprise. Inside there it is your typical bar with a pool table, bar and plenty of tv's to watch the game. It is surround by several dive bars and restaurants which can make parking a tricky.  The outside patio was awesome. There are two bars along with plenty of tables and chairs for seating. They also had cornhole and two ping pong tables which can become quite interesting/competitive  after a few drinks.   The  service was a little slow for Saturday. There was only one waiter outside to serve about 60 plus people. Its hard to drink on an empty stomach. One of the bartenders was nice enough to take my order after noticing my frustration. I order the bratwurts and fries. It was delicious.   I can't wait until the weather gets warmer to return. This is the perfect spot to hangout after work or for a chill weekend spot."}
{"text":"Thomas Street Tavern seems to be a great Plaza-Midwood place for locals to gather. It has the typical bar/tavern feel - large oak bar, booths and tables all made of dark wood, plenty of TVs, and neon beer signs in abundance. Inside is fairly spacious and outside there is a large patio with ping pong and corn hole. The crowd is generally pretty mixed, younger and older.  They have a decent beer selection and daily specials, and the food is pretty good, too. They do sandwiches, burgers, wings, and appetizers. Everything is fresh (food and beer), and service is consistent.  Thomas Street Tavern is my go-to in the area for something laid back on a night out and is a great spot to round out the evening."}
{"text":"Oh Thomas street. How I love thee. My favorite bar, and for one reason and one reason only. The staff. They make regulars and strangers feel comfortable. Its my version of \"cheers.\" Everybody knows your name. Pretty much my second home."}
{"text":"Hello Friends,   If you're here to read reviews for Thomas Street then you're already in the right direction of great bliss. I used to come here a lot back in my younger days (smirking). This is a staple in the community. A great meet up place to start the evening or to just stay and hang out.   Food is good, you'll never be there for long without meeting a new friend. The 1st bar at the entrance is small. With a few booths behind it. A pool table to the left, with more table tops and booths. It really reminds me of a shotgun house. Once you make it to the back and out the back exit/entrance it really opens up.   Outside you'll find a fire pit, long benches a few tables. To your left you'll find a more spacious (term used lightly) bar with a couple booths as well. Ping Pong/Table Tennis, modern day Horse Shoe game. I forgot what the kids call it now days. I really like the back patio its really nice.  Only draw back that i could think of is the dumpster that's back there. Summer time IT STINKS and that's all i have to say about that!!  Go Enjoy,  TTFN"}
{"text":"Thomas Street is by far my favorite venue and my go to on any given evening. They have moderately priced drinks, live bands on the weekends (beware: generally a $5 cover and only accepts cash for entry), and a large outdoor patio for smokers and their four legged, furry counterparts. The outdoor patio also features fire pits, heaters, ping pong tables, corn hole, picnic benchs and a few other games so needless to say.... there is entertainment for everyone! Service is always speedy for drinks and food alike which can be ordered until the 2am close and I've yet to have a bad interaction with any one of the staff. Again, my go to place in Charlotte when I want to come dressed as is and drink a cold one!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Prices are good.  Service was ok, nothing special.  The environment differs, depending on when you go.  I got a club sandwich that I would get again. Will most likely come back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Jamie was the one of the bartenders that served us and she was super personable! If you are visiting the Charlotte area I would recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Amazing spot. We did not eat here, but enjoyed cocktails on the massive \"back porch\" area. Expect a fun-loving diverse crowd, lots of bar games (ping pong, darts, pool, foosball, shuffle board), good service and well made drinks. The bathrooms could use some work."}
{"text":"Why is it impossible to find their menu online?? And why didn't I take a picture of it for Yelp??? Anyways...this is a pretty good local spot. I wouldn't say it's my favorite but it is pretty good. They have Stella (my favorite) on draft, which is always a win. We've tried different things to eat - most recently the spinach dip (awesome), chicken tenders (delicious and plentiful), fries (always good), wings (charred and tasty) and macaroni and cheese (bland).   Go. Try it. Have a great time."}
{"text":"Love this place in plaza midwood! Great food, cool people and bartenders are awesome! Great place to come with friends or yourself for a beer and dinner."}
{"text":"My experience would have rated 5 stars had this establishment had gluten free beer and/or hamburger rolls. Nonetheless, the service was friendly and professional even though our waitress was very busy. The wings came hot and crunchy and plentiful. Fries were delicious. Made from natural cut potatoes. My tuna sandwich was tasty and prepared as I requested. A big plus for me was the atmosphere. An eclectic mix of people moving in an out from bar to patio. Good music played and a relaxed vibe."}
{"text":"One of my go to places. Chicken fingers are the best in town. They have a bunch of great sandwiches and plenty of beer to choose from."}
{"text":"Meh, this place is great when the weather is nice as they have an outdoor patio with games and ample seating. The vibe changes nightly based on the clientele sometimes it is full of khaki clad frat bro's and other times people from the service industry around town. I have had fun nights here and I have had nights that were awful in terms of being surrounded by obnoxious or obscene people. Worth checking out especially if you have a larger group, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place."}
{"text":"We called before we came to see if they served steak. He said yes. Got here and no steak on the menu. Called the same number and watched the bartender answer the phone. Same guy I spoke to previously. Told him about our call and that there was no steak in the menu. His response was that they do have steak.....a steak sandwich that we could take the bread off and make it a steak. Seriously??  Our server was super slow. Waited 20 minutes for anyone to come to our table. By the time I was tired of waiting for her and headed to the bar to get my own drinks she finally showed up at our table. Did not take all of our drink orders before she left. Hardly returned to our table for follow up and then when she did we had to ask the same thing more than once. We will not be coming back and will be advising our friends not to come here. Customer service is not a priority."}
{"text":"My husband and I call this place our \"clubhouse\", equating it to the special places in the gated communities where some choose to live.  Thomas Street Tavern is one of the hubs of our neighborhood.  They make wonderful, fresh salads with plenty of dressing on the side.  Last time that I was there, my friend and I ordered the spinach artichoke dip.  So good.  Served with the right amount warm pita bread.  I have never been disappointed with their food.  The interior is just right for a neighborhood pub, and it features front door and back door outside spaces.  We have such good memories from years of hanging out at our neighborhood club house and can't imagine a better experience in a fancy-dancy exclusive community spot."}
{"text":"Great pub with a nice big outdoor area to contrast the dark inside bar. Best part is the outdoor bar, ping pong tables and lots of room to mingle outside. Great location in plaza as well as a decent beer selection. Would visit again on a nice spring day!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. This used to be by far my all time favorite bars. Now that I live so close, and my parting ways have calmed a bit, I still come here for a good bite. (Sometimes a drink) I really like they have two bars. One inside and in the warm months an outside bar. They also have table tennis and plenty of outside seating.   My favorite thing to eat is the french dip and pasta salad. The cuben aint so bad either. The nachos are darn good also. You really cannot go wrong with food here. All in all, a good place to hang out, get some drinks and bite to eat."}
{"text":"Had heard a lot of people mention this over the last couple years in Charlotte, so a friend and I (who had also never been to this place) decided to try it for lunch on a weekday.  I met her there and the place was typical of a bar/pub.  The back patio looked nice and large, which is where I've heard it's really chill to drink out back during the summer, but as this was a cooler day in Charlotte (high 30's), this was not so appealing.  The staff was helpful and friendly and pretty attentive, so this was clearly not what caused me to give them 2 stars.  It was the food.  I had a burger w/ fries and my friend had a BLT w/ fries.  It's not that it wasn't cooked properly or wasn't decent, it's just that it wasn't anything special and when it comes to bar/pub food in Charlotte, there certainly are other places that are much, much better.  All in all, it felt more like a bar/pub restaurant chain more than a neighborhood hangout and I was certainly expecting more.  Like I said, it might be a cool bar to hang out during the summer, but not a restaurant that should necessarily be sought after.  I'll probably give it another chance if someone wanted to go there, but won't be convincing my friends to go have a meal there."}
{"text":"Great beer selection good food fried okra is awesome.  Good local bar lots of character. Ping pong and cornhole in the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"The corn hole and ping pong hooked me right away. The combination of token drinking games and a large outdoor bar that made me feel like I was in my friends' backyard. The only thing missing was live music. While the inside of the bar didn't catch my attention, the outside had a lot of character The perfect spot for a hot Charlotte summer night. I didn't eat any food and stuck to the Corona 3 dollar special.   The fans spraying water is a nice feature on a hot night, but my hair didn't like the added moisture!"}
{"text":"Still scratching my head as to why I haven't reviewed Thomas Street Tavern yet... oh well.  I like the location of TST since it's in the heart of Plaza Midwood.  There have been plenty of times where friends were running late for dinner so we would pop into the tavern for a quick drink before dinner.  Never actually eaten here, but I suspect the usual pub-ish food.  Bartenders are pretty nice and the place isn't so crazy that they actually have time to talk to you.  I haven't become \"a regular\" yet, but I can see this place having a lot of those types of clients.  I've been in their outdoor area maybe once or twice and it is filled with activities.  In all honesty, I pretty much stick to home base - the bar... and I am pretty content there."}
{"text":"I was here to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Actually I've been here a few times prior but never wrote a review.  Here's my chance!    We met on the back patio.  They also have a front patio which is for dining.  The back patio has its own bar, a deck and various patio sports activities like ping pong and cornhole.   The deck is really relaxing.  There's a shade tree (I think it's oak) that keeps everything cool.  For food, their wings are great and I also order a veggie club that was amazing.  This is a great Plaza/Midwood neighborhood place but like other places in the area parking is horrible.  Be prepared to walk if the area is busy!!"}
{"text":"At last, I found what I was NOT missing in life... cigarette smoke-laced food at a pub.  (They allow smoking at bars still in Charlotte?)  Thomas Street Tavern offers  your standard pub-grade food: it will fill your tummy, stall or soak up the alcohol and get the job done.    What I enjoy about Thomas Street is that it's unpretentious: what you see is what you get.  Pool table, back patio, plenty of seating, decently priced beers and adequate service.  TVs that are just perfect for moving your eyes towards when your conversation lulls or when that hot guy you've been checking out catches you staring at him (just pretend you're looking past him, right? Hehe.)  Verdict: not a bad neighborhood pub, if your expectations are for a neighborhood pub."}
{"text":"Beer is cheap here! At $2.75! This place has a great outside patio in the back with cornhole, a lot of tables with umbrellas, ping pong tables, pool table inside! Great place to hangout and chill with friends in between brewery hopping and or checking out Charlotte! A couple of bars and breweries are also nearby! also ordered a basket of cheese tots for $5.50! Fun vibes in this place!"}
