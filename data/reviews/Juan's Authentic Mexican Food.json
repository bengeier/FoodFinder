{"text":"Oh, Juan's, you taunt me with your scrumptious #28 (cheese enchilada and chili relleno).  The beau and I recently discovered this place, way too close to our home, and we now need to eat their two or three times a week.  Really good chips and a fresh, simple and bright-flavored salsa.  Packed at lunch time but they still have super fast service."}
{"text":"Woo hoo Good traditional Mexican. I should have taken the last posters advise and got my geeen chili burro enchilata style! The salsa is spicy and they serve the drinks in a to go cup so you csn take it with you."}
{"text":"Juan's is by far the greatest Mexican food spot in the valley. I may be biased since I have been eating here for 20 years now (Used to be located on 16th st where the Walgreens is). I dont need a cool \"hippster\" vibe to add to my meal....just give me the basics; Delicious, friendly with great service. 
Green Chille Burrito-Amazing
Rice and Beans-Amazing
Tamale, encilaldas, taco's...every item on their menu is a solid decision and you wont be dissapointed. 
New to the resturant? Ask the server for suggestions.
I have my favorite dishes there but after eating there so often I have literly asked the waitress to suprise me and have never been let down."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place has delicious food!! Went with coworkers for lunch for the first and I'm going become a regular. We went early, 11:00 am and it was nearly full by 11:30. Just walk in and grab a table or booth. Service is prompt and friendly. I wish I could remember our server's name. She was pleasant and attentive without overdoing it. 
I had green chile pork burro enchilada style with green sauce. Holy delicious!! Ate that whole thing and wanted to lick the plate but I showed restraint since I was in public! Can't wait to try other menu items!!!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food in fact I loved Mexican food so much I married a woman (back in 2007-2010 been free of the shackles for 6 years now) of Hispanic origin (Mexican). She cooked really good Mexican food but let me tell you this place is right up there in terms of authentic taste! The vibe you get when you walk in and the layout makes it feel authentic as well! Their horchata's are sweetened just enough to make you want more! Their chicken enchiladas...man don't let me get started I'm hungry now just thinking about it! All I can say is that if you read this review and you're not already on your way to the restaurant to try it out then you need to reevaluate your priorities! Juan's is the epitome of authenticity!!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food you will get in town...and it's cheap on top of that!!!"}
{"text":"Please explain how they get the food so hot! I loved the green chili burrito enchilada style. When mama figured out were here she said we had to bring her back a chili reyano (spelling?) We'll be back!"}
{"text":"After reading the revues its really kinda a mixed bag.  I mean if you don't want to wait for a table, don't go at peak hours.  I've never had any thing stale or old tasting.  They have a huge menu serving alot of different dishes.  I have to admit, I usually order a la cart because I cant finish a combo.  Right now I'm stuck on the cheese enchilada, side of beans, and a large flour tortilla and they are huge!  The service is always excellent and I have never had any long delays in getting waited on or getting the food.  There is nothing I know of on the menu that isn't tasty.  But, one the I would like to mention is the things you can take home: such as tortillas2.45 for a dozen that weigh over 3 lbs.,  hot sauce very reasonable, beans at a good price.  Just a thought.  Oh and I can't remember being made to feel as welcome as I do at Juans.   Ciao"}
{"text":"Really good food at the given price. If you're looking for cheap, good Mexican, this is the place to go to. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely best Mexican food in the Valley. If you don't know authentic Mexican food then you won't like this place but if you do this place will never let you down. Fantastic salsa with chips made on the spot. Juan (the owner) always greets us and says hello. If he doesn't see us come in he will make a point to come by and say hello before we leave. Couldn't say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"I have been to the restaurant several times in the past and the food was OK, but never this bad.  Chips and salsa were old and tasteless.  Taco shells were old--meat was tasteless--rice was cold.  Had a fish taco--Other restaurants serve a piece of fish (usually cod or tilapia), but this was small pieces which tasted like river bottom catfish.  REALLY, REALLY BAD.  Service was Ok, but I will never go back---DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME--TACO BELL IS BETTER"}
{"text":"My brother and I have been going to Juan's for years. It is family owned and they recognize us every time we walk in. The service is solid, but they do get busy during lunch so sometimes you do have to be a little patient depending on the time you are eating. The food is good and cheap. I recommend the #1 with a soft chicken taco and a green beef burro. I also like the #22 which is a steak burrito with onions, peppers, guacamole and comes with a side of rice and beans."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Mexican spot since moving to midtown. There are tons of trendy taco spots, but if you want really delicious traditional Mexican food, Juan's is it. The fresh chips and salsa are delicious and plentiful. I always get the taco and enchilada platter: one of each plus rice and beans. This is one of those places where the sides are actually not a throw away - they are so good! The enchilada sauce is divine, but the tacos just can't be beat. Good service as well. This place is consistently awesome."}
{"text":"Been going to Juan's for over 10 years.  It is family owned, they are great people but don't expect them to be gregarious, they seem somewhat shy.  

This place has great family style Mexican food.  The salsa is not out of the can as some have suggested, it is fantastic.  The chips are a weak spot, not always fresh or hot.

I love the chimichanga and carne asada tacos.  You can't this quality and quantity of food for less than $8 anywhere else.  The beans and rice are also great, if not understated.

Another way to rate a restaurant is it's cleanliness.  They always get top ratings by the county health department.  They can get really busy at lunch and Friday nights, guess lots of other people think this place it great.  Another sign that the place is good....lots of cops eat there too!"}
{"text":"This place knocked my socks off and I'm still dreaming about it 3 years later. Exactly the kind of unpretentious authentic food experience that we all need in our lives. I don't remember everything I ordered, but I remember even the cheese quesadilla was a revelation. If I ever go back to Phoenix it'll be the first place I go."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at Juan's in years, since my work moved and I live in the far north part of the valley. But was in the area the other day and stopped in to have lunch! I'm happy to say the food is just as delicious as I remember! I forgot how much I loved their food."}
{"text":"We usually get Juan's take out 2-3x's a month. Never disappointed! My favs are the Taco Combo plate with shredded beef. Another favorite is the green corn tamales. I have never gotten a stale chip or not to par salsa from there in my life! Chips are warm when I pick up and the salsa is fresh with the great mix of cilantro and spice. Must be luck. 

I have only dined in 2 times, and the service was great both times, even though it was pretty packed. They even refilled when I was only half full on the drink. 

This place is consistently good!"}
{"text":"Juan's has the best bean burritos! 
Freindly, clean & independant."}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican food there is and the staff are wonderful. They are always helpful"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant of all. We used to go to Juan's up to three times a week back in the day. We don't eat out very often anymore but always love going to Juan's. Irma, Tony and staff are the best!"}
{"text":"The salsa here is the best you'll find at any Mexican restaurant (within or outside of this price range). They also bring you free chips and salsa as soon as you sit down, which is becoming less common - so very much appreciated!

On their nachos, they ask if you want shredded cheese or nacho cheese. I always opt for nacho cheese, because what's the point otherwise? The nachos are good, filling, and reasonably priced. 

But what really makes this place amazing is their bean and cheese burrito. Such a simple menu item, but SO delicious, especially with their salsa!! I take the bus into work, and I was tempted to drive in just so I could pick up another couple burritos! It's a newfound obsession of mine. No wonder Juan's is always packed... go check it out!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Juan's after a terrible experience at Barrio's (around the corner).  Boy am I glad Barrio's sucked because discovering Juan's was definitely the silver lining.

Great food, super cheap, and, even better, run by a very friendly family.  Had a great neighborhood feel to it (we were visiting Children's Hospital and don't live in the area).  Diverse lunchtime crowd including artists, firemen, and hospital staff and everyone seemed like they were regulars.

Juan's is a gem.  We'll definitely be back whenever we have my nephew at Children's (which sadly, is all too often)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything I've ordered has been so good, and the price point is right where it should be. I generally order the machaca, tamales, or the supreme nacho's with shredded beef. That machaca is so freaking good. I can eat it by the spoon full!"}
{"text":"Awesome service/food/prices
It was my favorite place to get Mexican food when I lived in that part of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices. HOT salsa - I love it!
Nothing fancy, but very good and very filling. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places in Phoenix. Family run, authentic, cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"This is terrible.  The food is very bland and service is very slow.  The employees act like they're the only restaurant in town.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one."}
{"text":"Their food is delish!   No matter what dish I've had , I've never been dissapointed.  I would say the prices sometimes are a lil higher but food is good!   I was a fan before they changed locations, they used to be a small hole in the wall on 16th and Thomas... I hate their new locations it's hiddend and parking sucks.  BUt the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is great! First time customers and visiting from out of town. I had the grilled chicken burro with rice and beans which was delicious. Customer service was good and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Always busy at lunch but worth the waut.  Had the best green chili and pork burrito.   Chips are fresh and salsa is flavorful but not to hot.   Very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Mexican food. Prices are very reasonable, the staff is always friendly and I like the inviting atmosphere. It's a mom/pop hole in the wall neighborhood type restaurant. It can get full, but we have never had to wait long. It's definitely worth the wait or you can call ahead for pick up."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their chicken tacos are simple but delicious. The green chile burrito also great. Their spices are spot on for my tastes! It doesn't hurt that it's within walking distance. I don't love that they are closed on Sundays though but no big deal."}
{"text":"Clean, affordable, delicious, genuine, friendly, established (twenty years) - Juan's lives up to its name. 

Do you remember when a kid's menu was affordable? It still is here. 

It's open seating, and you pay at the counter. 

Watch the zen in the kitchen. 

It's a mature restaurant; would not be surprised if they expand soon."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots go dine after a loong wait of sitting around in the Indian Hospital's many waiting rooms. 

I've never been there during lunch hours, usually right before the evening rush and I've never experienced a long wait. I've noticed that it's pretty quiet, I'm usually sitting at the loudest table in the place! The service is decent. I've had better and I've also have had FAR worse! 

The food is good. Their combinations are GIANT! And so is their soda! They come in these HUGE cups, and it's hard for me to finish a second! lol, but someone at my table is always willing to help me! Their tortas are to DIE for!! I always order either the Al Pastor or Carne Asada Torta! Their salsa is very good but it can be a struggle to get the waitress to get a second bowl. 

The staff behind the counter always seems busy preparing food and getting to-go orders ready. It's sometimes cool to watch them go at it all warp speed! One thing about this place is that you have to go up to the counter to get your ticket when you're ready to pay instead of having the waitress bring you the check. This is a cultural thing, a lot of hardcore authentic mexican places are like this, so just go with it. 

Parking in their lot can be a lil tricky, I've hit a few cars trying to park my car here, but I think it's because I'm a bad driver. But still make sure your rear view and side view mirrors are facing the right direction! :P and expect a great meal with no frills or BS pretention, this is the real deal... sure, there's better places to get great Mexican food in the town, but after spending half a day to have an IHS dr. tell me that all I need is tylnol, all I want is a flippin' taco!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a coworker and it did not disappoint.  The portion size is big and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  They have a quick and prompt kitchen which is nice, but you wouldn't know because the food tastes so good.  I recommend the works burrito.  It is big enough to take care of my huge appetite."}
{"text":"Food is good, not great but the best is the price. Best price for Mexican food around. We go in the early evenings and it's full."}
{"text":"We just found this place today and oh my goodness!! It was so delicious... my husband brought me food to my work down the street and we loved it so much that I stopped and picked it up for dinner on my way home. The carne asada burritos are delicious. We added beans and they were so filling. We have a favorite Mexican food restaurant in Cali and this rivals that for us!! Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Juan's could be one of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to.   This is a family owned business. The food is authentic, prices are cheap, service is great!  A friend of mine suggested that we go there because they did very well with the health department inspections.  What a great treat.   If you did not know it was there, you would never stop in.  Do yourself a favor, stop by if you are in the hood (16th street and Thomas)!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for mexican food! i'm here at least once a week. There might be only be a handful of places that have better mexican food but dollar for dollar this place is by far the best!!"}
{"text":"Chips in chips and salsa had funny taste. Service poor. No one cared for refill on chips or salsa. 
The place got full for dinner but ambience remained heavy and sad. 
Wait for standard menu item 14 was little too long. 
When arrived Chile Rellano  (so?) were pobrecito (pauper) and no taste. 

Could be good for someone who has not tried other Mexican food joints or visiting in a group and hence are there for company and so much about food."}
{"text":"Juans is like finding the perfect shade of lipstick, you feel so lucky and good all day!!! i LOOOOVE this place, one of my favorites, an close to my casa~!~ EVERYTHING and i do mean that is there ggin tastic! good prices, daily specials and you can call an order in and it will be ready in 10 minutes! go, NOW what you waitin for!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service with excellent food! Family owned and managed. Every dish is fresh and made to order. Complimentary chips and homemade salsa. Side note: love the geographical relief map of the state of Arizona! Stop in for a casual come as you are relaxed dining atmosphere."}
{"text":"Clean, cheap and fairly tasty.  If you want hotter salsa, the very friendly waitress will get it for you."}
{"text":"I decided to visit Juan's on the advice of a family friend. She was raving about the red menudo, so I came here with my parents.

I ordered a plate of tacos de lengua. My dad got a shredded beef chimichanga and a shredded beef taco, and my mom had a carne asada burrito (w/o guacamole) and a small bowl of red menudo. Everybody enjoyed everything.

My tacos came to the table wrapped in foil, and when I opened it... WHOOSH! They were filled with steaming hot meat, onions and cilantro.  The steam just wafts out straight to your nose. Beef tongue is amazing when it's done right, and Juan's does it just right.  That lengua was so tender: it's like butter when it hits your teeth. I put a little salsa and jalapeños for some spice. So good!  Beans and rice were good, you can't mess that up.

The menudo though... that menudo? My mom was murdering it, so my dad ordered a large bowl and shared it.  That broth was so flavorful and had plenty of hominy and tender chunks of tripe.  Why have I never been here before?

Pretty good service too.  I'd love to come back and try the infamous chile relleno or the green corn tamales!"}
{"text":"Juan's has the best beef tacos.  And their lemon margaritas are really good too.  Sometimes they get pretty busy but that's because it's good.  The service doesn't really suffer, just the timing of when you get your food.  But it's well worth it."}
{"text":"AMAZING GREEN CHILE!! Wish we could take it back home with us! Food was amazing (Verde burro and asada plate), staff was friendly, great atmosphere. Will definatly be the first stops on our return to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Deeeeee-lish! Good, old fashioned and legit Mexican food. It seriously tastes like you're enjoying a home cooked meal at a friends' home. Simple plates full of flavorful food. I demolished my chile relleno, beef taco and rice and beans. Yep, all by myself. The prices are so affordable too that I can see why customers keep going back. Staff are friendly and service is good too. An all over good go to spot for satisfying your craving for good homstyle Mexican food."}
{"text":"Chilaquiles is on point. I bought them last and saved them for breakfast today. The sauce and tortillas were SO good!"}
{"text":"I'm in *love*! Today was our first time to Juan's. We recently moved into the neighborhood and found it in Yelp. The reviews are great and we discovered that Juan's is just as promised. Authentic. Delicious. Friendly. But... Don't be in a hurry. They're a busy family owned place, so sit back, relax and enjoy the tasty chips and salsa! I recommend a large drink so you don't need to ask for refills. The tacos are amazing and the green tamales are to die for! Don't think it over. Just go to Juan's!"}
{"text":"I work nearby now and ordered take out for my co-workers. Green chili burritos nonetheless and everyone absolutely loved it! Guess, that's how to do it. Order take out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  been going here for years the # 1 is the way to go red chili is amazing"}
{"text":"Juan's is a Phoenix staple in my opinion. I moved here from the Northwest about 3 years ago and I've tried just about every Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix downtown area. Juan's is defiantly up there with the best of them, the burritos are awesome and filling, the carne asada is amazing and the tacos are WHOA! I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for a large, Delicious meal not looking to spend a lot of money (did I mention they were cheap?!?)"}
{"text":"One of my father's patients had recommended Juan's and said it was the best Mexican food around. My Dad and I decided to test that theory on a recent trip I had to Phoenix.

Juan's is an unassuming box building with a green awning and sign that reads \"Juan's Authentic Mexican Food.\" After entering, the first thing I noticed was that there were a lot of Hispanic people enjoying their lunch, which is always a good sign. The establishment is clean and simple. You have the option to take out or dine in with waitress service. Dine in we did and we were greeted by the peppiest waitress I've come across in a long time.

I ordered a carne asada burrito, enchilada style and with sour cream and guacamole on the side. It was excellent, and ridiculously filling. In fact, sad enough as it is, I couldn't even put it all down. And to wash all that down I had a nice sized horchata. My Dad had a quesadilla and was equally satisfied. Mmm, I'll be back Juan. Mark my words."}
{"text":"Juan's has been a long time favorite of mine. I like the quick seating and service and you can leave without putting a dent in your wallet. This is the traditional Arizona blue plate Mexican food but the taste is authentic and the beers are cold. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good food but not 4 stars, I got #4 combo plate -- taxi is good, way too much breaking around enchilada Abd pretty bland beans and rice. Cold chips and commercial salsa..."}
{"text":"Freshest Mexican food I have ever had. Tortillas tasted like they were made 2 minutes before I walked in. Good portions and good prices. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Okay, let me start by saying that the food here is normally delicious. The beans are excellent and tastes so close to my Mom's that I looked for her behind the counter! Their cheese enchiladas are perfect, they even ask you if you want onions or not! Most restaurants don't ask and you find big chunks of white onions in every bite, ruining it (if you don't care for onions, like me) and forcing you to pick them all out. Ugh. Funny thing though, we usually go on Wednesdays but recently , it was late Saturday and I was bragging about the food to my grandson so we stopped in for dinner. Wow, what a difference from early mid-week dinner to late end-week. I had never ordered the cheese crisp, but did and when it came to our table, I thought it had yellow and white cheese at first glance but no! It had so little cheese that the tortilla was showing through!!! It was awful. The bean and cheese burrito that my grandson ordered hardly had any (if any) cheese in it. He gave the thumbs down on the whole experience. I was bummed because I had talked it up so much! I'll go again, but not at the end of their work week and never later in the evening. That said. Love their food, service and salsa. Try it. Family owned and operated I believe. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I love Juans!  I have been coming here for about 10 years and the food is definitely authentic!  I have always had great service and most of the time is is pretty quick.  I have found the owner, Juan, to be very friendly.  The salsa is great and I haven't had anything I don't like here.  Their refried beans are fantastic and my favorite is their green chile!

I highly recommend Juans!"}
{"text":"best authentic mexican restaurant in phoenix by far, love the price, love the people love everything about this old school restaurant. 10 out of 10. nothing else to say speechless."}
{"text":"Visited on March 1 for dinner with a large group. It was super crowded, pretty noisy (these are things I can forgive if the food is good). Service wasn't great either, there were only 3 servers and they were working pretty hard. We waited a long time for our orders and about 2 people had to wait a really long time for their food.

The chips and salsa were eh, ok. I ordered a chicken enchilada and a beef taco, no sides. The food was bland and not too flavorful. Unfortunately, a person in our party found a hair in their taco. After hunting down our server, she quickly took it away, but there was quite a wait for the new plate.

It's cheap, but I wouldn't go back unless I had no choice."}
{"text":"I got chicken and vegetarian tostadas and it was very bland. I used a lot of salsa, which also was not very impressive."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and fast as well. Great prices and the food is outstanding. Plenty to offer on the menu with a large selection. Will eat here again,"}
{"text":"The food was ok, not exceptional but priced accordingly. 

The staff was very polite and welcoming. 

The place was exceptionally clean, not just the serving area but even the bathrooms cleanliness surprised me.  I can only imagine the back kitchen being as well kept and for that reason give them a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Food is decent but the service sucks if you sit at the bar. They get so busy they ignore you. It's easier to order ahead and pick it up to go."}
{"text":"Well if you think this is Authentic and great food the Mexican cooks you know aren't very good. I went with Authentic Mexican friends and none were impressed by the food. I called it mediocre and they called it less than. To me it reminded me of Home EC, Mexican food cooking lessons of the inexperienced Jr High Student. Oh, but wait... they don't teach Home EC anymore! So grading this meal (dinner) would be difficult. At least the waitress had a cool air about her that said I don't eat much of anything here, so you can't hold my opinion up to any of this feed. That's right feed not food. 
Furthermore the decor and vibe in the place is lacking. Sitting there reminded me of a pass life experience of eating and waiting at a bus terminal."}
{"text":"With the exception of the tortillas, this place is pretty run-of-the-mill for Mexican food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been going to Juan's for about 5 years now. Best enchiladas anywhere. Amazing service."}
{"text":"Remember people!!!! When they call themselves \"Authentic Mexican Food\" it is s h i t t y food!!!!!

Make yourselves a favor and DO NOT attempt to eat this b u l l s h i t!!!!!!

IT IS NOT MEXICAN FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I really wish they lose their business because they are lying to everyone!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food at Juan's.  Have been back a few times and really like the green chili beef burrito.  They're closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"I don't give any restaurant a 5STAR; but Juan's is as close as I get.  I've been going to Juan's since it used to be on the NE corner of 16th Street & Thomas (1994?); when the kids were small; now they are much older - and all still working at the restaurant.  I don't think there is one thing on the menu I haven't had.  But to give you suggestions:
* Chile Relleno - won't go to anywhere else
* Green Corn Tamales - didn't like them until Juan's
* Machaca (either Burritos or Plate)
* Refried Beans - plain & simple but the best around.
* Beef Tacos, hey I love them - can't explain it just do.
* Burritos always at least 2 meals for me.
I love that they expanded and made it with more booths.
Love Arriba's, Sylvia's La Canasta, Mi Patio, La Tolteca and many others...But, Juan's will hold a special place in my heart & stomach..."}
{"text":"Juan's is a fabulous Mexican restaurant in Central Phoenix. Hidden near the 51 and Thomas Road in a building that looks like a sports or topless bar, Juan's offers excellent Mexican food with great prices and friendly service.

For under $6 one can order a huge burrito and a large (\"small\") bag of chips with salsa to go. Even when the spacious restaurant is crowded, there is normally not a long wait to be seated and order. Introduced to this restaurant by a friend of mine who was born in Phoenix, Juan's is now in my \"regular rotation\" for Mexican food and a place that I like to share with friends."}
{"text":"Juan's is definitely an awesome place for tacos and burritos.  I have eaten at Juan's for a couple of years now.  The only thing is that if you come for lunch on your lunch break you will have to make sure you tell your boss that you will be gone for a couple of hours.  :)  I say that because they are always really busy and the place is not really that big.  It was nice when they expended the restaurant last year.   

I love there tacos,  it is really worth the wait.  So,  if you are driving around and looking for a place to eat you should head over to Juan's.  The wait staff is always really friendly and they go pretty quick too."}
{"text":"Love the food, fast and friendly service. One waitress always remembers me and asks about my baby girl when I go in there. (Sometimes after MONTHS of not going in.) This place gets super packed around lunch time but I can see why. Again, excellent and authentic (I'm from San Diego and know my Mexican food). They are also priced well. My husband is a big guy and we both leave full for about $20 average."}
{"text":"My friends, who live in Arizona, brought me here promising me a great dining experience with fantastic authentic Mexican food. Being from Alaska, I don't get the chance for authentic Mexican food very often. I was severely disappointed.

The service was horrible. We waited too long to get a table, too long to get our order taken, and way too long for boxes for our food. The staff was friendly, just incredibly slow. Granted, the restaurant was full.

The food, however, was also a letdown. I've had better Mexican food in Alaska. Won't be going here again."}
{"text":"This is really nice Mexican restaurant the people are friendly the food is excellent and prices are good I will be returning  make feel at home."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today for the first time. Different. The chips left a lot to be desired, but the food was okay. The taco was smaller than you get in most restaurants, so that was a bit of surprise, but otherwise it was edible and just okay. Shooed a fly off the wall by where I was eating so that didn't wow me. Waitress was friendly and attentive. Not in a big hurry to come back. There's better places in town, and without flies."}
{"text":"Yummy food that won't break the bank and good service. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"I've gone to Juan's on and off over the past ten years. I return, because I forget that the last time I went I told myself to not go again.

I agree with a previous rater, Juan's food is so-so and acceptable.  Generally speaking, the service might be called good service (\"...except for the owner who is...\").

Be prepared to wait and no matter what, the wait to get your food is always slow no matter how empty or packed--ESPECIALLY if you order take out and ask how long before pick up will be ready. On a recent occasion, I placed a take out order and asked the owner on the phone how long it would take and he told me 20 min.  I waited 15 min before leaving the house and it took 5 min to get there. When I arrived and asked for my order, I was courteously advised by the cashier that it was \"not yet finished.\" I watched the kitchen staff as they initiated preparing my order from the beginning. As I observed this process I asked the clerk why she said my order was already in process and she responded that \"...it was.\"

When I had first inquired about my order (having been told it was 'nearly ready') I asked whether chips had been included and the owner advised me that I would have had to have ordered chip and paid for them.  While I waited AT the restaurant for my order for 20 min (that is in addition to the 20 min I waited before leaving my home) I would have thought management would have been courteous enough to offer me chips while I waited. They did not. So, instead of apologizing for the inconvenience of waiting on them or making my wait pleasant, I left a very dissatisfied customer.

When I got home with my order, I had to endure my companion's complaints that the Albondigas was skimpy on the meatballs. Same said companion used to frequent Juan's extensively several years ago when he worked closer. He now challenges me each time I indicate intent to go there and refreshes my memory on past disappointments.

The burritos are indeed well made and are pretty much the highlight of the menu. The tosdadas shell are not freshly fried (you can see them sitting on a shelf above the grill), yet, my tostada was still soft. The prices are cheap $7-8 combos. Again, fair if you are in the area but you can find better Mexican elsewhere, even nearby.."}
{"text":"I live on Mexican food! They have the best Mexican take out seriously! I love the tacos and the burritos here. Also they are pretty quick, clean and have awesome people working here. If your in the mood for Mexican this is the place to go! I have to complaints ."}
{"text":"Walked over here after originally intending to go to the nearby Barrio Cafe. However, after noticing the high prices, long wait, and yuppies dipping baguette bread in salsa, we decided to abandon ship and sought refuge and nearby Juan's. This turned out to be a great decision. Food was excellent, and prices were very reasonable. Reminds me of the Sonoran food typical in Tucson...which in my opinion, has some of the best Mexican food in the country."}
{"text":"Great food ... Best rice and beans from a Mexican restaurant. I like  this place a lot"}
{"text":"Great quality and price.  Nice interior and frindly staff.  This time I had a Chili Relleno plate.  So many places don't have good rellenos and every place is different.  These folks have properly prepared and very tasty rellenos.  No folded in an omelet sort of short cuts here."}
{"text":"Best danged salsa, don't like the pico de gallo, something is missing, Diane says it is lime juice. I love my burrito beef mixed chile and shrimp tacos. I am also found of the flautas.  Not fond of the guacamole, it is kind of tastless,  I like it with jalepenos and lime juice and tomatoes. The chips are great with the salsa. I don't know what happened to the beans but I still give Juans 3 stars."}
{"text":"Food was Okay, not impressed. No sauces or chiles! The menu does not indicate if they use lard since they claim to be authentic."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food with good consistent service. Beer and wine too! Eat there about once a week, never fails to please!"}
{"text":"I love the salsa; plenty of garlic and no green chilies. I pick up to-go containers all the time, and it  gets hotter and tastier the longer is sits in the fridge. 

This is the kind of Mexican place where everything is fried. There's no windows, so if you go at a peak time, you're going to smell when you leave. It is dive-ish, but it's family run and they are really nice folks. 

Everything is good, especially the albondigas soup. Get a combo with whatever you want, as the rice and beans are top-notch."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place! My co-worker got me hooked on this place. It's only a couple miles from my work and I'm so glad. When I had knee surgery and couldn't go anywhere for 2 weeks I was so bummed and kept craving Juan's. the first day I came back to work I went to Juan's for Lunch. 

The portion's and prices are great. I have ordered many different things there and I haven't had a complaint yet. They have the most amazing Green Sauce, I get it on everything...lol. I wish I could figure out the ingredients! The staff is always friendly and personable. Typically Crystal is my waitress, and she's always serving with a smile. My favorite thing to get there is a Bean, Cheese, And rice burrito with green sauce in it and a medium coke....which I usually pay about $7.50 for. I have turned several co-workers here into fans of Juan's. 

Even now, I'm anticipating my paycheck next week so I can return to my favorite mom and pop Mexican food joint! :)"}
{"text":"I am not sure that some of these people were at the right place. I have never had a bad meal or experience there. All food is homemade including the salsa. The grilled shrimp are amazing! If you order beans, rice and salsa..mix altogther..aka: \"the mixture\"...that's all you need on any given hangover or non-hanging day...it's like crack salsa....It has always been very clean and great service...go for breakfast or lunch before 11:15..then after 2...otherwise you will wait a very very very long time...or dinner you can always get a seat....LOVE YOU JUAN!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. The best food, huge portions And reasonably priced!!  Thanks Juan's!!"}
{"text":"This afternoon Rand H. and I stopped in for an early dinner. It was nice and cool inside. There was a booth available to our left as we stepped in the door. We were greeted with chips and each our own little bowl of spicy good salsa. No more than 3 min later we were greeted by our hostess Crystal and asked what we would like to drink. One minute later as we wet our whistles we ordered our din din. Rand ordered a #14 Chile Relleno & shredded beef taco, and I ordered a # 36 Pescado Relleno (Fish) plate.

No more than 7 min. later I was looking at my meal and it was looking at me. (The fish was served flayed open with head and tail still attached.)
ONE WORD:  Yummy! It was tasty as can be, and I was glad, as I normally order a Carne Asada Burrito when I eat Mexican food. I highly recommend this spot and It's a shame Alexander and Nader had such a soggy humid experience here. It seems to have been fixed as this was not the case on my first visit here this evening. 

Oh, and I liked the old photos of things like Poncho Villa's Wanted poster and other early 1900's historical Mexican events."}
{"text":"Another mixed bag when it comes to Mexican food. Juan's was pretty good; in fact, I really liked pico de gallo a lot as well as the pork and green chile burrito. But, I am a stickler for chips and salsa. Most places always serve fresh chips and refreshing salsa, but Juan's chips were stale. Also, the salsa tasted like tomato juice mixed with diced veggies; it almost had me saying, \"NEW YORK CITY?!\" (hopefully that joke isn't too outdated). On top of that, the tacos I got were also a bit stale. Again though, the pork and green chile burrito (served enchilada style) and the pico were wonderful! Ahh! Such a mixed experience!

I know I'll be back to Juan's eventually, but now I know what I'll probably stay away from on the menu (it is possible it was a fluke, but we'll see). The service was pretty speedy and pleasant so I can recommend it for a quick/cheap bite, but choose your food wisely."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've been to so far...family owned so they are very hard working people and take pride in their work. Sometimes orders take a little longer than usual but it's because it's always busy during lunch hour both take out and dine in. Other than that the food and service is great. I recommend the green chile burritos, shredded beef tacos, and the chile rellenos."}
{"text":"Best food ; ) come here every week love the works burrito and service is great but parking sucks"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican joint of all time. Been coming here for over 20 years and never had a bad experience. Service is always warm and friendly. I've tried most of the menu and my favorites are the machaca dinner and the chile rilleno. Nothing fancy, nothing over the top; just great, authentic Mexican food. 

The place can get extremely busy at lunch time. I love placing pickup orders and grabbing them on my way home. 

Wish all Mexican food could be like this. It's just perfect. Every. Single. Time."}
{"text":"Juan's is a neighborhood restaurant with good food. Nothing fancy, just good food. We live in the neighborhood and have been there many times. Good selection of beers and friendly staff. I think you'll like comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"So I was looking for a place to study Zapruder film for my thesis on why the United States government killed J.F.K.  Turns out Jaun's doesn't have WiFi.  Whatevs'.  That might have put a magic bullet in my plans, but I wasn't going to be discouraged in chasing the truth.  Speaking of the truth, Jaun's is legit.  Let me tell you why.

The service has always been good in my experiences there, and I've been coming to this little neighborhood joint with my family ever since I was old enough to first learn about the Gulf of Tonkin.  So like, seven?  The restaurant has always been family owned and the dad/mom that own it will always recognize you like how I can recognize an obvious government cover up.  Puercos...

The food's consistently good, and cheaply priced.  I tend to get the #17 combo plate with lengua tacos, rice and beans.  Nom.  Trust me - carne asada fans, don't be afraid of eating tongue.  You already eat up enough of it from politicians, might as well branch out to something honestly good.  Smother everything in that salsa of theirs and finish it all off with some sopapillas?  With the honey?  Please.  You'll be so content that you'll go right back to being a mindless drone without a second thought.  Operation Northwoods who??  Exactly.  You shill.  You happy, full, shill.

Don't even get me started on their #6 chimichanga plate.  Throw some red sauce and guac on that thang'.  Hope you don't have to go back to the office.  It'll leave you leaning back, and to the left.

Anyways, the Warren Commission couldn't even keep this place under wraps.  It's clearly a staple in the neighborhood with the amount of regulars lined up out the door on that grassy knoll.  I mean side walk.  Sorry...

...Oswald didn't act alone.  Great parking.  Don't be afraid to park in the bail bonds lot next to it too.  Anyone going there doesn't own a car."}
{"text":"You know I drive by this place almost everyday & live a few mins away! Crazy huh! After putting gas in my car I stop in. They have been there for 23 yrs! Where have I've been, lol. Great service, delicious tacos... ordered a bean & cheese burrito to go but was to full to eat it, yet!"}
{"text":"The best tacos and guacamole!! Really wanted authentic Mexican food and this place did not disappoint!  Love how my taco shells were slightly deep fried!  Washed it down with a nice Negra Modelo!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Juan's is the kind of place that ethnically Mexican people actually go to eat (WOW, SHOCKING) because (a) it's authentic, both in feel and flavor; and (b) it's darn good. Juan's food is 100% delicious all the time - from the burritos to the chimichangas to the tostadas, rellenos, tacos, basically whatever your heart desires.

It's the place to go for the genuine article, quintessential Mexican goodness. I won't be surprised if most people from Scottsdalewood can't stand it, or find it \"unrefined\", but I don't care. It's great. End of story."}
{"text":"Not bad mexican food. I like their guacamole - even though it looks like pureed baby food. I usually get a bean and cheese deep fried burrito. The salsa is kinda too hot for me. I have eaten there at least 5 times and the food always seems to not be as hot as I would like, but still bearable."}
{"text":"Great cheese enchiladas, shredded  beef tacos are sooooooo good and price is right. Chips are ok salsa is a little more watered down then what I like but it's ok. The best part of this place is food is very inexpensive. Staff is nice. My order has always been accurate. The only thing I don't like about this place is parking. It's such a busy place therefore parking is tight and there's not enough spots to park. Aside from that I give Juans 10 STARS"}
{"text":"Love their Tacos, and their red chili burros are good too.

Cheese enchiladas are not cooked enough, and not cooked in an oven.

Place can be incredibly busy at lunch time."}
{"text":"I love me my Juan's!  

I debated between 4 and 5 stars.  I decided on 5, and I will tell you why!

FOOD gets the 5 stars- a rating for \"Old School Mexican Food\"; not for Elements or Kai.  In the genre of budget-priced Mexican food, it's a 5 star.

The food is SOOOO good!  It is that old school Sonoran style type of Mexican I remember from when I was a kid in Phoenix (60's-70's).  It is simple, generous servings but not monstrously so.  

The staff are long-term, get to know you types.  They work hard, and are very easy going when it comes to just about anything; even when you pay, they'll take your group's bill and allow you to pay one at a time, so no dealing with a split check a the table.  This is good for groups going out for lunch from work.

In the early 90's there original location was on 16th St- TINY... and they were renown for their burros.  They are still a mainstay today and if you aren't certain of what to order, get a burrito.  Their tortas are also exceptional.  I am partial to the basic combo plates.

The drawbacks:  and yes, there are some-  

TIME.  I would go more often, but the amount of time you will wait can be very inconsistent.  Even when we arrive early (for lunch), there can be delays.  I shouldn't be gone for more than an hour for lunch, and have been 90 minutes twice when out at Juan's.  For me, this is a problem.  And even though i really like the wait-staff, i think that there are some organizational issues that cause the hold-ups.  Maybe understaffed?  I don't know for sure, but it's worth mentioning.

CHIPS.  I like the chips and hot sauce, but don't LOVE them.  They are the old school variety, which are OK but I do like me some really hot out of the fryer chips served with cold chunky salsa, and that's not what you'll get here.  You will get the smooth red hot sauce and usually tepid thicker chips. 

If you  haven't tried Juan's, and you don't have an inflexible schedule, DEFINITELY give them a try.  Order an old favorite, and see if you like how they prepare it."}
{"text":"We drive from Scottsdale just to have Juan's food!  If you are looking for 5 star atmosphere, not here, but if you are looking for 5 star food.  You are in the right place!!!  This Phoenix restaurant is family owned - Mom runs the kitchen, daughters run front of house with mom and dad and the brother run back of house (except for the cooking) and the register.  Once they know you, it feels like you are part of the family!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had, especially the horchatas. Great service and all of the things on the menu are homemade"}
{"text":"Just Not For Me

The staff at Juan's Authentic Mexican Food is warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Juan's so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.

This was my second visit to Juan's Authentic Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food is just so-so. Just one step above what you would be served in a fast food establishment.

I enjoy starting my meal with chips and salsa just like everyobe else.  The salsa at Juans is like a watery tomato puree posing as salsa and the chips tasted stale. For my entrée I choose the Beef Flatas and Mexican rice, both of which had very little taste.  The meal was just very disappointing and took over 30 minutes to serve.

Juan's isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again"}
{"text":"Full disclosure:  It's probably getting a bump because it's so close.  That said, I was hungry, wanted Mexican, and Juan's did not disappoint.  Green Chili pork burro totally hit the spot - atmosphere was clean and welcoming.  Chili Relleno was good, not mind blowing, but certainly not the worst.  I'd go back for sure... In fact since its so close, I could see it being a go to spot for the south of the border cravings.

Which reminds me... I'm overdue for a Soñoran dog."}
{"text":"I was hesitant on trying Juan's, as I fellow Yelper who I respect, totally slammed this place, several years ago.  Well, I am glad I did give this place a chance.  For what it is (cheap Mexican food place) it is very good.  I did not love the chips and salsa (free) but the food was fresh and tasty.  Refried Beans, great, rice was so, so.  Their taco's reminded us of a famous taco place in California (Tito's) they do serve beer and wine (wine is super cheap at $2.50 per glass) our server was really nice."}
{"text":"Visited Juan's after reading the numerous complementary reviews. Unfortunately, our experience did not come close to that of more enthusiastic reviewers. The service left something to be desired, primarily because we had to wait over thirty minutes for our food to arrive, even though the restaurant was not packed until after we received our food. Additionally, I was not impressed by the tamale on my plate and found the cheese enchilada cold. My husband was also less than impressed by his chile relleno, but found it more edible than my food. Overall, we have had much better Mexican food at numerous other establishments in the Phoenix area and will not be returning."}
{"text":"The line to get a table for lunch here even at 11:30 was almost out the door. Crammed into a tiny little space in midtown Phx, once you're lucky enough to sit down you'll be treated to delicious salsa which has a bit of a kick to it, and a great menu selection. This is the quintissential Phoenix Mexican dive. I love it, and will return often."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. The price is right! The margaritas are delicious. It isn't a big place inside. But the food is worth it if you ever have to wait. The staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"So we walked into this place around 6pm.. it was SO hot and humid in there it was barely tolerable. After we were sat this baby started screaming and puking all over the mother, the table, itself.. was pretty disgusting. After getting over that the waitress brought over menu and chips and salsa. Took one bite of the salsa, that was it.. out of here. The salsa here is from a can.. tasted like tin with some added cumin. The chips were cold, greasy, stale and soggy form the humidity. Threw a buck in the table and walked out. 

Perhaps its better in the winter time sans the swamp coolers and the puking baby?"}
{"text":"I come here everytime I'm in Phoenix.  This place is as authentic as you can get!  Get the tacos."}
{"text":"Juan's Wednesday.
It's a thing! (At least where I work...)

While I can't vouch for the restaurant itself, I do know the food to-go is awesome. I got the carne asada burro which was $4.79 and worth every penny. Beware of food belly: it's all meat! (Well there's onion, cilantro, and guac in there too, but it's mostly meat) The tortillas aren't quite as good as Carolina's, but they are a little denser/stretchier which is good when you're not up for messing around with a messy burrito. The meat was flavorful, and lean! I hate when there's a bunch of fatty goobery pieces in the carne, and Juan's didn't disappoint. I only ate a little over half of the burrito because it was so big...and I needed room for chips and salsa.

Now the do or die: chips and salsa. I fancy myself a salsa connoisseur, and this was 8/10 only because I prefer a chunkier salsa. The flavor was really great though: smoky and spicy and obviously fresh. The chips are house made and perfect--firm but not hard, and crispy delicious. Hence my conversion to Nachos next week. 

Normally, I reserve nachos for sports bars and happy hours, but next Juansday I am totally ordering the machaca nachos. My work husband got them and they look/sound delicious.

Give it a try. You know you ... JUAN to. *dies laughing*"}
{"text":"I ordered, picked up my order, came home and all I had was French fries. I ordered the egg and chorizo plate with a taco. I ordered a side of fries. This place is about a 10 minutes drive from my house. Not far but far enough. I should have checked the order when I picked it up but I suppose I didn't expect people to be so incompetent that they couldn't put things into a bag. It's not that hard. I know I sound like a jerk but I'm writing this literally right after I had a conversation with an employee named Pablo there who really irked me. 

I told him I was unhappy and that I wanted a refund. He immediately said no refunds. He also tried to accuse me of having the order by saying they don't have any left over food. Then I asked to speak to a manager who could do something. He a said the manager went to lunch. It is 7:00 pm. After continuing the conversation and explaining to this person that they cannot keep my money for a product I never received and no longer want, I asked when the manager would be back. He said he doesn't know and they will probably be back \"like on Monday or something\". I then questioned him about his statement earlier saying the manager is on lunch. He said the manager went out to eat. Then I asked him if they are on lunch until Monday. He said that it was obvious I should know this since they're about to close and that's their store hours. I replied to him that I don't work there so it isn't obvious to me that they would be there on Monday. I have to say that this person came off as a condescending, uneducated, liar. He is not the type is person a proprietor would want answering their phones or being the vocal representation of their company. 

Considering there are over 100 Mexican restaurants within 10 miles of this place, you would think they weren't such inflexible jerks. I went to PHX Burrito House instead where I get great food and great service. I will never order from this place again. So much for wanting to try something new."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an amazing, authentic family owned and operated Mexican good restaurant this is your place! Never in my life have I had better tasting food and the friendliest service. They're almost always busy, but the food is worth the wait! You'll thank me later..."}
{"text":"Salsa has a homemade spice to it served with chips. The lunch special menu was simple just one item. So I took a gamble and ordered a milanesa torta. It was delicious but they could of put more mayo or beans to compliment the meat."}
{"text":"This is one of Phoenix's hidden gems! It is family run and you can tell. The food is great and the service is as well. Juans is one of the few traditional Mexican joints left. I highly recommend checking it out. Try the green chili!"}
{"text":"I agree that Juans is good but its not the best Mexican food I have ever had. What makes or breaks a Mexican restuarant for me is the chip and salsa and I thought the chips and salsa were average at Juans.
I had the combo #15 which is a cheese enchilada and a beef or chicken taco w rice and beans. The refried beans were the best part, they are super tasty. The price is right and the portions are big."}
{"text":"This might be the best Mexican food spot in all of Phoenix. It is family owned and the whole family works in the shop. The food taste just like my nana made it. Have been here a few times and had different dishes and all have been good. Bean burrito enchilada style, menudo, carna asada taco, huevos rancheros. All have been on point. 
Customer service was also really good. Can tell it is a family spot that values return customers."}
{"text":"Great food, great people. Plenty of seats any time of the day, overflow seating is only used if needed. I personally find the ground beef to be pretty dry but still packs favorable flavor. My partner loves this place and we eat here at least once a week since we live near by. You wouldn't even know this place existed if you were just driving down Tomas road not looking for it but definitely worth looking for."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 10+ years. The staff is amazing. And the food is delicious! My favorite is the chicken enchiladas.  I highly recommend coming here. One thing I do miss is when they use to delivered. Please please please bring that back."}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 20 years the last 3 years I ate there five to seven times a week never have ever I had anything bad there. The chorizo is made in house everything is made in the house you can watch the food cooking on the stove. Erma's chile rellenos are to die for. Their green sauce is different from any other green sauce I've ever had and I buy it by the quart and use it on grilled pork ribs to die for"}
{"text":"Simple Mexican food. Fresh and homemade, friendly fast service and great prices. Whats not to love about Juans?"}
{"text":"My review is simple.  Juan's is straight up nasty.  Please avoid this place and spend your money elsewhere.  If you are in the mood for enchiladas I would recommend Gadzooks that is close by.  If you want a burrito go to Rito's.  If you want tacos go to La Santisima taco shop.  All are close by!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, fairly cheap and friendly. Chicken supreme nachos are delicious as are the chile rellanos"}
{"text":"Friday's lunch was my first visit to Juan's. I had my usual Mexican dish of Pork Green Chili Burro. Juan's version of this dish was a little light on the pork but very tasty. Chips were fresh and the salsa was spicy and flavor packed. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Juan's is so-so, acceptable but the guacamole, salsa, and chips are not homemade. I have been coming here for about 10 years, although not frequently. We know the family that runs the place and everyone gives great service except for the owner who is unfriendly. Lunch hour is always packed, be prepared to wait and no matter what, the wait to get your food is always slow no matter how empty or packed. 

On our recent visit, our chips were cold and stale, you could taste the lard and the salsa is a runny type most likely from a bottle. At least that's what is tastes like. Nothing about the beans and rice stands out. The burritos are well made and are pretty much the highlight of the menu. The prices are cheap $7-8 combos. Good if you are in the area but given the choice of having to take a drive, you can find better Mexican elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great spot.  It has a family feel which has kept me coming back.  Consistent with quality and priced reasonably well.
I can't recommend just one item. Combo plates are good, enchiladas tasty, nachos and carne fries great.  Don't just drive by, give Juan's a try (see what I did there )"}
{"text":"I went to Juan's yesterday with some friends from work. When we got back they asked us how it was. It was okay. 

I was pretty underwhelmed with the service, chips, and salsa- all pretty bland. My chimichanga was okay, big and beefy, pretty difficult to mess up. The guacamole was weird though, really thin and pureed, possibly from a mix even. The beans and rice were standard, and everything came in very big portions, including the soft drinks which are roughly the size of a small bucket! I liked my friends green chile plate much better than what I got, which is why Juan's gets a generous third star, otherwise, this place would be a solid 2 stars. 

It is really, super cheap and they don't scrimp on the AC (it was about 60 degrees in there!) Some people probably like that, I think it makes my food go cold way too fast. Would I go again? Meh. Maybe. If I was in front of it and felt like big, cheap Mexican food- otherwise there are many other places I would opt for."}
{"text":"Juan's is where you go for an authentic, straight from your nana's kitchen vibe. What I love most is their no frills approach. There was never a time I didn't crave a plateful of their beans and rice topped heavily with extra sour cream. I mix everything together to create my comfort food holy trinity. It's almost ritualistic. 

While I love a \"dressed up\" experience from time to time, it's good to know businesses like Juan's remain successful. I feel the secret to their success is simple: Good food prepared by good people."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and they have never disappointed me or my wife. Great food and service, also love getting my tostada fixings here. I buy 2 dozen shells and beans with all the toppings to go with them. Great for a small gather or game. Love this place."}
{"text":"On Thursday afternoon at 1:00 PM there was no problem parking. They did reserve seats for our group. This is a clean, quiet, no frills Mexican Restaurant.  We got attention as soon as we sat then five minutes after at which time we ordered. The Chips and salsa were very flavorful.  The service was brisk, and the food was served hot. Each plate that I saw was covered with food. The person that ordered tongue got to nice slices. I had  #14. The Chili Relleno was of good size, filled with cheese and smothered in a piquant sauce that had both liquid tomato and chunks. The chicken taco was about six inches long and four inches high. It was filled with chicken, and tasted strongly of that meat and the shell it came in. The rice was firm and the bans were smooth. I cleared the plate. Something I did not intend to do, that's how good it was. 

This is a no frills Mexican Restaurant. It's five stars because it does what it is so well. The food is reasonably priced. The service is quick without being rushy. It is clean throughout. I don't know what more you could want from a place like this. I give it FIVE STARS."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place for a few years now. Its to the point when someone from work brings it for lunch, I can tell just from the salsa smell they went to Juans. LoL. The chips and salsa are always a listed item when we order to go from here, for about $1.30, you get a small (which isn't small) bag of chips and salsa. Always ask for extra salsa.

The shredded beef or chicken hard tacos are always fantastic, the fluatas (rolled tacos) are good here as well. You can get them in a combo with rice and beans at a very reasonable price $7.00-$8.00.

When you're sick? Go for the albondigas soup (meatball rice soup). It is soooo good and soothing to aching throats and it just makes me feel better when I'm under the weather. The broth is light but flavorful, with rice on the side, you can add or leave. It comes with flour or corn tortilla.

The have red and green chili corn tamales. Both are fantastic but I go for the green chili corn, extra sauce $2.00.

The service is always nice and professional when we stay in. They're quick to ask if we want a refil on soda, chips, salsa - check back a couple times to make sure you have everything you could want. Sometimes we'll call our order in and decide to sit and eat instead of coming right back to work. Their so easy about letting us do so.
When dining in, I get my order quickly. If we're calling in for lunch, we call about 1035AM, since our lunch is at 11AM and before their rush hour begins. So in all, there hasn't been a problem with getting out food.

When you first walk in for lunch, the sitting area looks small. But when it gets busy, they open the back area which has quite a few more booths back there. They have a flat screen going in the corner and also \"bar\" seating. The only thing that bothered me about this place is the Specials board is always under the t.v. at the far end of the dining area. You'll see it if you happen to go to the bathroom or know to look over there.

Oh yea, a large drink is extra large and medium is large. Sometimes I forget and have this delicious but HUGE Horchata, because I said large. This includes both the to go and dine in cup."}
{"text":"First time here and already disappointed in their service! Not enough staff to handle a party of 20. Took forever to take our order and only 1 lady running food! Haven't even tasted the food yet to review that! Service is already so bad probably won't return!"}
{"text":"Good food at a great price. Wait staff is attentive and pleasant. Be prepared for long wait times if you are going for lunch, though!"}
{"text":"For some reason the Valley doesn't seem to have many good, authentic Mexican restaurants, so I was happy to find Juan's. It's quite tasty and super inexpensive, a perfect combination in my mind."}
{"text":"OMG!! The spinach enchiladas were amazing! They are not on the menu but you can order them. I ordered them with the delicious green sauce. Not only was the spinach there but a welcome surprise of sour cream and plenty of cheese! 

My first time here, but won't be my last! 
The portion was generous and I'm adequately full!"}
{"text":"Juan's is my all-time favorite Mexican food restaurant.  Usually we call ahead and pick it up because the lunch rush CAN be a  bit daunting, but for all of the business they do, they seem to handle it as well as possible.   the service is always friendly and the portions are huge and cheap.  the salsa is fantastic!  if you're in a hurry, i recommend ordering to go or going EARLY or LATE."}
{"text":"it was alright. kinda on the pricey side when it comes to the sides they charge for everything.   the horchata is really good, unfortunaltly i order sopapillas and asked for some lechera,. they had none only honey ...they should have more options like hot chocolate caramel ext."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is some of the best tasting Mexican food in Phoenix. The staff is very friendly, recognizes just about all of their regulars and make you feel like family while at their restaurant. At times, the wait can be a little lengthy but it's worth the time and it allows you to enjoy more of their delicious salsa and chips. I recommend the chile relleno or red chile tamale."}
{"text":"The food here is great! You get seated and each table has a number. Once you've eaten you go to the counter and pay. They have your table number already ready. I love the chicken and beef tacos, the tamales come covered in sauce and my boyfriend loves the shredded beef enchiladas."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years and now remember why.  Saturday afternoon - medium crowd. Service was slooooowwwww. Ordered \"award winning\" nachos as appetizer, but came out with the meal. Authentic Mexican? Think again, unless canned nacho cheese sauce is your gig. Beef taco wound up in my napkin - couldn't get past a second bite. Meat tasted funky!  In order not to be too brutal, the enchiladas were edible. Zero personality with our server and counter cashier. Must hate their jobs. No mas Juan's for us. Our bathroom can attest to that three hours later."}
{"text":"This place is extremely close to my home, so we frequent this restaurant for takeout fairly often. The restaurant has been pretty busy every time we have gone, which is always a good sign. Living in Arizona for over 27 years I have always been a good fan of Mexican food and this place is solid. It's nothing fancy, but that's perfectly fine by me. Go to's for us are the ground beef chimichanga, the flautas, enchiladas, and their tacos. Have never been disappointed by this place, and they are usually very efficient and timely with orders regardless if the order was placed in the restaurant or over the phone. I am allergic to avocado and they are very good about making sure that my food doesn't have any guac or avocados, while still making sure my fiancee gets her avo fix. Were a fan of Juan's!"}
{"text":"Way affordable! Food was excellent. Prepared in front of customers, cooks wear hair nets and gloves which is comforting for me during flu and cold season. This place rox! Customers flocking in near lunch from businesses...gets really busy. This family owned business has been around for years, my parents intro'd me to them when I was younger. Love the atmosphere and diversity. They are never too busy to greet everyone."}
{"text":"Juan's is hands down my favorite Mexican place in Phoenix. Everything I've had has been delicious and the prices are very reasonable. Staff is always friendly as well! I work at a large agency not too far from Juan's and everyone is obsessed with the shredded beef tacos. Try the #2 beef. You shall not regret it!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Juan's for over a decade.  I love their food so much.  Sometimes we even go multiple times a week.  We are regulars and the workers know us and we know them.  I am addicted to their cheese enchiladas and their bean and cheese burritos enchilada style. I will admit the service at times can be super slow, but the food is worth it.  You get great food at great prices."}
{"text":"Excellent the BEST food ever 
The staff are exceptional 
The food is prepared in front of you
Never had s bad meal 
If you love mexican food this is the only place to go"}
{"text":"Been going here for a long time, and am completely enamored with the food, service, prices and family-run atmosphere every time.  I take everyone that visits there for a taste of 'real mexican food' and it's one of the only places I love enough to review.  

The prices are great, and the food is both incredibly tasty and remarkably consistent from visit-to-visit.  I honestly don't know why, but it's also the only Mexcan restaurant where I always leave feeling full in a good way - I've never felt the typical pains associated with overeating after leaving, even when I've certainly gotten too full. 

I recommend the Enchiladas, beef tacos and tamale in their #12, or the steak gorditas in #13.  They're slammed during lunch on weekdays so get there by 11AM or after 1PM."}
{"text":"We are lucky enough that this is our neighborhood spot...it feels like half the people in there are regulars every time we go. Above average quality for super cheap prices, I am in love with their tortas! ONE WARNING: the tamales are not very good, avoid them here. everything else however is great, you will be wwaddling around full for an afternoon"}
{"text":"I called in a phone order for Combo #9 - 2 cheese enchiladas with rice and beans, and the food came out tasting excellent! Tasted just how homemade Mexican food should taste! They approximated that the order would take about 15-20 minute. I got there early and had to wait, but wait time was accurate. I will definitely be returning here again!"}
{"text":"Prices were okay.  Food was okay.  The server tried to take my plate without asking whether I was done, and I informed her I was not.  Ten minutes later, she just took my plate and walked away.  I guess we were close to closing, which would be understandable, however we weren't aware they closed at 9 on a Friday evening, which seems a bit absurd.  Had they actually informed us, we'd have gone, no hard feelings.  Instead, all I remember from Juan's is my plate being yanked away from me."}
{"text":"Juan's is a classic, always dependable and never disappoints. I've been coming here since my high school days and everyone I bring here loves it. Great prices and fast service. I'm a fan of the carne asada nachos and a margarita on the rocks."}
{"text":"From the outside, it looks a bit sketchy and ghetto. From the inside, it's not that much nicer, but don't let the deter you from coming! The service is fast and friendly. The food... amazing!

We tried the beef tongue taco, pork burrito with green chile and a chicken quesadilla. The quesadilla came out like a pizza - different, but good and worth trying! The burrito wasn't overstuffed with rice and the taco was amazing."}
{"text":"Bro, all I have to say is this is FOOD. Coming from San Diego this is some great food. Glad I could find this place."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and hot. Service is always friendly. A great choice for me, but there is not much room inside. It is better to take it with you."}
{"text":"I Ordered the red Machac Burrito with rice and beans enchilada style it came to the table hot there rice and beans are absolutely fabulous I don't think the beans are necessarily fat free but splurge it's worth it they give you chips and salsa when you arrive at the table the chips are hot and Salsa is perfect it was an absolute treat to Fine this place and it would not have been possible if not for Yelp so thank everyone out there yup society you did a good job today D"}
{"text":"I had the number 12 to go. I was disappointed with this dish. It was greasy and had too much cheese. It was also fairly bland."}
{"text":"Juans is a diner style Mexican Restaurant. It looks sketchy from the outside and also on the inside but the place was packed with people so I had to try the food.

I had the number 10 beef enchiladas w red sauce.  The plate comes with rice and refried beans.  They started me off with chips and salsa.  Being a bit of a salsa expert, I think the salsa was a bit watered down and had too much garlic.  However it was about a 2 out of five stars.

The imported bottled beer is only 3.50 a bottle so that was a nice price for a Pacifico beer with lime.  

Upon the arrival of my food, the plate was very hot and the food was fresh.  The rice was awesome and had a great flavor, and the refried beans were among the best i've had.  The enchiladas were three stars out of five as the sauce was bland and appeared to be out of a jar.  However they were able to salvage the plate by adding fresh onions on the enchiladas which raised the taste to a 4.  The prices on the menu are very reasonable and overall was a good meal.  

Would like to try some of their other menu items to give it a better rating."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food I have had in the Phoenix area. The meat was tender, shredded and flavorful and they had a lot of great options to try all your favorites. Definitely a gem in the area and I would recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't just hand out 5 stars...However this place is close.  Simple, authentic, and fresh!  This place is super clean and I was not sure what to expect as an out of towner.  Great place and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Juan's to me shortly after I moved to Arizona. It's good Mexican food. I always get a tostada, because it's my favorite Mexican dish, but this place is known for its burritos. 

Make sure to make an early or late lunch, because this place is packed at noon. You can see them prepare your food at the counter and you go right up to the register to pay."}
{"text":"Rudest cashier ever! I placed a simple order of enchiladas style fries. I was given the wrong order. I waited over 20 minutes. I come here every week and this is how they treat a regular? Don't come here unless you want to be treated with disrespect!!!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Juan's for about 15 years and have never been disappointed. Their works burrito is the best in town, especially with their homemade green sauce which is creamy and cheesy and gooey and spicy and otherwise indescribable. You can dip your chips in it, put it inside the burrito, outside, or just drink it straight out of a cup (I haven't done this, but given the opportunity...). I've customized my works burrito in a variety of ways. I've had it with shrimp, fish, carnitas, carne asada, pollo asado, chile relleno, machaca, shredded chicken, a combination of several meats at once, with one tortilla instead of two (less carby), and with no tortilla at all (great as a chip dip). I actually drive nearly 20 miles just to eat here. Their salsa is excellent, and their chips always fresh. This is one of those gems that you would never suspect from passing it by on the road. This isn't just another burrito shop, this is the best Mexican food in the valley!"}
{"text":"Sawbthe great reviews for Juans and had to try it out. 2nd time here. Great food. Prices are awesome. Waitress Crystal is super nice,fast and efficient. So happy we found this little gem."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times I love there food it reminds me of being in my grandmas kitchen. I would really would recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've had in Phoenix. I can recommend the chimichanga and the supreme nachos. Maybe the best nachos I've had anywhere period."}
{"text":"The food is only slightly above standard, but they do not cook phone orders when you call. I called in an order and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I didn't get my food until 45 minutes after I called! People we're getting orders that they ordered after I was already there. The worst part is that no one apologized or thanked me for being patient. If I hadn't already paid I would have left. Terrible service!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and super clean. Got my order to go. Staff was very helpful and kind had a beer while I waited and it felt so good."}
{"text":"I literally saved this place to be my 100th review on Yelp I love it so much. This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in all of Phoenix. I have been coming here for 16 years and while the restaurant has changed tremendously over the years, the food has not. The family that still runs this place treats everyone like they are part of their extended family. If you are in the Phoenix area and are looking for some quality Mexican food, I would definitely encourage you to visit. It will be well worth your time."}
{"text":"What a great little place. Was brought here for lunch my some coworkers. Small and authentic looking. Food was very good. I love Mexican food so much. I would rank here very high among my favorites. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Juan's food is authentic Az Mexican food made with very fresh and real products. Every time I come to Phx we stop for lunch or dinner at Juan's on the way home from the. Airport."}
{"text":"I work close to Juan's and have been here on a few occasions. I often find myself wondering why they are always so busy or what makes them so popular. The food is good, not great, but still good. I'm not convinced that the guacamole isn't made from powder. The beans are runny, the rice is pretty average and the service isn't the fastest or the best. Funny thing is I still go back from time-to-time. 

If you want a decent meal at a good price then by all means this will do the trick. If you are going for lunch give yourself plenty of time or call in advance and pick it up. The parking lot is small and fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Listen... we wanted the best breakfast burrito ....& someone recommended Juan's. It. Was. The. Best!! The guac was so yummy & the the burritos had a lot of eggs & bacon... so good. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! The food was amazingly delicious and super fresh. Portions are very generous. Our waitress was friendly and cheerful. The menu includes many Mexican favorites most for under $10. They offer any of the beverages to be refilled and placed in a to go cup. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Juan's is my favorite Mexican restaurant. It's a warm, welcoming family run business. The food is authentic and delicious. It's highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm pulling out the five stars... their services now is now much faster, the food is so reasonable, the staff is friendly.  I find myself coming in once a week now."}
{"text":"Prices were cheap however food was served well after others who came in and they literally put Brown gravy on the Mexican food, staff ignored simple requests...only reason for 1 star was due to price"}
{"text":"Not such a bad place. It has a reputation in some quarters as a sort of Mecca. You'll get good prices on decent Mexican in totally unpretentious surroundings. Not really Mecca"}
{"text":"This place is great. It is divey and cheap, yet it has fresh tasty food coupled with outstanding service. It is also very clean. This full service restauraunt has nothing on the menu over $10 and everything is wonderful including some of the best rice and beans in the valley. the food is authentic and everything is not covered with hot melted cheese. The tamales, burritos, carne asada and enchiladas are great. This place is always crowded but has lots of tables and  I have never had a hard time geating a seat and I have no problems saying this is one of the best mexican spots in the valley."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, authentic Mexican food and the servers are very friendly. However, if this place is crowded, be prepared to wait a long time for your food...I waited 45 minutes once -yikes! The prices are great though and my family of four ate here for about $24 which is an awesome deal."}
{"text":"Love this place have been going for over 17 years !!!irma and crystal and big and jr juan are the best !!! Irma knows exactly how I like my pico !!! They are always friendly fast and I have never had a bad experience!!'  I have tried everything except cow tongue lol and it's always the best !!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE THE BEANS! Great food and great family owned restaurant,been coming here for years!"}
{"text":"Love. If you need pretense and high prices with your Mexican food, Juan's will completely disappoint. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a fast, tasty meal with super friendly service, you've found your place. And dirty cheap, at that. 

Better yet, if you can't find what you want on the combo menu, you're just too damn picky. I have never been to another Mexican restaurant with so many combo plate options--whatever you want, you'll eventually find it on the list. 

Helpful tip: Drinks, weirdly, come in sizes even for dine-in. The \"medium\" is pretty much a bucket, so save your dinero and don't go any larger."}
{"text":"The best chips and salsa I've ever had! I usually order the burrito enchilada style, and their enchilada sauce is beyond good! Pleasant dining in experience and super fast on the to-go orders. I love juans!"}
{"text":"So......My boy B Davis wrote a review on this spot and said it was legit.  I have been in Phoenix for over a month now and have not eaten any GOOD Mexican food!  I was craving some tacos so I decided to try this spot out.  I was glad I drove down!

I walked in and was told to sit wherever I wanted.  I grabbed a table and a nice lady came over to take my drink order and deliver some chips and salsa.  I placed my order for 2 beef tacos and a cheese quesadilla with green chiles in it.  I had a large Diet Coke to drink.  Here is how the food was...............

Chips and Salsa-  They bring you out a large basket of chips and a little thing of salsa.  I took a bite of a chip and had a flashback.  They reminded me of something.....I took another bite and then it hit me.  These chips tasted exactly like the chips at El Tarasco in Manhattan Beach.  That is definitely a good thing.  El Tarasco serves up whole fried tortillas.  Juans cuts them into chips but the taste was identical.  I was impressed!  The salsa was tasty too.  It was pretty mild and refreshing.  The chips were so good that I ate 2 baskets full!

Beef Tacos-  I got 2 of these bad boys.  They are a bit small but they were awesome.  These also reminded me of somewhere from back home.......Titos Tacos!  Similar taste, texture and size.  Titos uses more cheese,  but other than that, they were pretty similar (Titos are a bit better but hey...Titos makes the best hard shell beef taco ever...no shame in never being as good as Titos).  The shredded beef was seasoned well, the shells were perfectly crispy. I would have liked a bit more cheese, but it was still enough the way they came out.  It was a fantastic beef taco!

Quesadilla with Chiles-  When I bit into this, it ALSO reminded me of somewhere from CA....... Sombreros!  I would always get a beef taco and quesadilla combo at Sombreros.  This quesadilla was an exact replica!  It had nicely melted cheese, tons of green chiles and it was folded up into a nice flour tortilla.  I dipped this in the salsa and it was a winner!

Diet Coke-  Nice to see they serve Coke products.

Total for my meal was $11.12.  Not too shabby for a grip of food.  I ate 3 different things and each one reminded me of some of my favorite Mexican food places from back in CA.  You simply cannot beat that!  Service was very friendly and it felt like you were eating in someones house kind of.  I can't wait to go back to try out some of their other offerings.  I can see this place becoming our families go to Mexican joint.  It's a bit of a drive from where I live (its way closer to work), but I was very impressed and will be back soon.   Good find B Davis.....good find!"}
{"text":"How many restaurants does it take to make this guy happy?? Only Juan!!

All jokes aside, I love coming to Juan's!  This has become my neighborhood go to if I'm craving Mexican food.  I usually order take out, I call my order in, and it's ready in 10 minutes.

Really dig the atmosphere in Juan's.  Think old school diner that has a mom and pop vibe, that serves great Mexican food.

I read other yelpers hating on the salsa here, I'm going against the grain.  The salsa is tasty.  Not only is it amazing as a hot sauce on any of the food, but it is one of the better Chips & Salsa, salsas I've had.  It not super chucky but it is very flavorful, the green onions are great.  

The Carne Asada Burrito or the Supreme Nachos have been my go to items.  I really enjoy the flavor of there Asada.  Very flavorful, tender marinated steak.  Not dry or chewy.  

I'm finding the prices are cheaper than Fili, Ari, Ali-\"Berto\" spots, and the food is more enjoyable.  

Arnold said it best, \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"I was in the area and was looking for a casual Mexican restaurant and stopped in here on a whim. Juan's is in a older building and there's nothing fancy about the place, but the food met and exceeded my expectations, in flavor, quantity and price. I had a Chile Rilleno and a Chicken Enchillda with retried beans, and it was all delicious. When I ordered the Relleno my waitress raved about how good they were, and from the first bite I understood her enthusiasm - I wished I had ordered 2 more! The salsa was good enough for me to take home some - I'm kinda tired of the diced-tomato kind, Juan's is more like a sauce, and I'm still enjoying it at home. I'll definitely keep this place in mind."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The staff is very friendly and are very attentive if anything is needed even when very busy! The food is delicious."}
{"text":"I moved here from Tucson over 2 years ago and this is one of two Mexican restaurant that I have found that is as good as anything I can find in southern Arizona. The chimichangas are great and so are the enchiladas which is a staple of any Mexican restaurant atmosphere is laid back and the staff is friendly as can be"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great prices, awesome food, and the friendliest people!"}
{"text":"Place is family owned and operated which is a big plus for me. They serve the authentic Mexican food I grew up with...there are no others around!  I believe the bad reviews are because the people are accustomed to another style of Mexican food, or the chain restaurants.  If bad service is the issue, everyone has a bad day. However, it is not an excuse!  Good service is hard to find Anywhere!!"}
{"text":"Good and very affordable Sonoran style Mexican food. Family owned established 1994 and very popular with locals and tourists too."}
{"text":"I used to love to eat at this place. But it seems everyone goes there and is always packed. Not enough cooks & servers to feed the mass of people who eat there. The staff always seems rude, to wait for your food for about an hour is crazy. You don't even have to wait that long a a steak house where the food is cooked fresh, not sitting."}
{"text":"Good food and the staff is nice. They get Togo orders out the door pretty quick even when they are busy. Been going here about 8 years now and can't say that I have ever had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. The food is always great and the service never disappoints. The only bummer is that they close on Sunday's but I understand everyone needs a break once in a while. My husband and I come about once a week. When we moved back to Phoenix after being out of state for two years this is one of the first places we had to come back to. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Co-worker of mine told me about this hidden treasure and I decided to give it a try. It is located not in the best place in town but location doesn't matter for me because I went there for authentic Mexican food. The place was packed during lunch with families and blue collar workers. That should give you a clue that its the spot. 

We ordered Green Chilli, Tacos and Quesedila to split three ways. Green Chili was amazing, tacos and  quesedila were good. Overall I had great experience and I can't wait to go back there."}
{"text":"Family owned homestyle mexican food for the masses. Good flavor inexpensive. quesadillas for the kids and cheese crisps to start while you wait . Guac is good. My fave are the tacos chicken or beef. I have friends who are fans of the green chile really havent had anything on the menu I didnt like. They do serve beer as well. During dinner area is full and they usually have two servers. Always friendly (maybe just not peppy) and even if food isnt fast its not because the workers are sitting around twiddling thumbs."}
{"text":"This was supposed to be the best Mexican food in town, but I was not impressed. It seemed like your basic run of the milk - nothing special Mexican place. The food was good but it was not super amazing authentic style Mexican. The flavor was very blah. I was disappointed and to be honest the service was not great. Our waitress was friendly but the cashier was obviously wishing she could be anywhere but there. She didn't even try to fake a friendly smile."}
{"text":"We used to go to Carolina's regularly, but after reading reviews on Juan's, I thought I would give them a try. Have never gone back to Carolina's. 
The food served at Juan's is delicious and cheap. Their nachos with guac and machaca are the best I have ever had. The service is quick and I always feel at home there. I try to go once a week, and I never walked out disappointed.  For me, that's great atmosphere. They sure sodas in huge glasses, as is their generous portions.
Their green corn tamales are the best, as is their green enchilada sauce. Also a favorite are their cheese crisps, machaca enchilada and ground beef tacos. Try their sopapillas for desert."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and has that authentic taste. Service was great as well. Loved it here. We will definitely be coming back with the family!!"}
{"text":"Juan's has the most amazing potato taco's I have ever had in my entire life.  Most of their food is downright spectacular.  Juan's is known as a hidden gem for local's.  The restaurant does not look like much, but inside grandmothers are making tortilla's, and everyone is happy to see you and serve you some of their authentic fare.  The ambiance makes you feel like you are in rural mexico.  The food makes you feel like you are in heaven."}
{"text":"If you have been looking for a true hole in the wall Mexican restaurant for cheap tasty authentic Mexican cuisine, this is your place.  I must have driven by Juan's a thousand times on my way to work without ever noticing it.  It is a totally non-descript cinder block building with no windows or obvious entrances.  It's a little scary looking, especially since it is right next to the 51.  Trust me.  You need to check it out.  Inside is a bustling family run restaurant that feels like home.  The food is really good.  I have already been back several times since being introduced to Juan's by a friend.  It is destined to become a part of my restaurant rotation."}
