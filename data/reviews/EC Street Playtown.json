{"text":"Fun place for kids 3 and under.  Much older and they may get bored (at least my 4 year old would) but a great place for a birthday party or playdate."}
{"text":"My children love this place! And I get a moment to relax while they enjoy all the fun it has to offer. We are really excited to have my sons birthday party here next month (he loves driving around and going through the carwash) and the rates are really reasonable. I met the owners and they are very nice family people. I recommend ec street to all my friends and family that have children."}
{"text":"It's a great place for birthday parties!!! There are tons of toys and activities for the kids."}
{"text":"The owner is sooo nice and so accommodating! You will feel so welcomed when you first arrive I love that the people that work there are so nice and make you feel so comfortable. The play area is totally closed in which was one of my favorite parts also they don't allow shoes on the playing floor which I really love because let's face it shoes are so nasty and dirty! So many different toys to play with and use your imagination as well as a little ball pit and an inclosed infant toy area with age appropriate toys - they also have a cafe where you can buy drinks and snacks (at great prices!) and you can also bring in your own food so you can enjoy lunch there. They have high chairs for the little one's and tables of course. They have the best BEST birthday party rate that I could find and it's totally private so if you are looking to have your kids birthday party other than the park or home seriously check this place out you won't be disappointed. Great place, close if you live in the North Valley, friendly and safe. I don't normally review places but this one was worth it!"}
{"text":"I spent a couple of hours with my three year old on a weekday. The Owner was very friendly and extended the Groupon price even though we didn't know there was one available.  The interior is simply laid out-some individual rooms that have themes-a kitchen, vet room, tool room, grocery area. Nothing fancy-a lot of Melissa and Doug toys which are favorites of my daughter. She had a great time.  Some of the toys are a little worn or without batteries (probably to reduce threw noise)!  There are chairs and couches for adults and a kitchen area to have your own snacks or there are a handful on sale.  The largest room are mostly toddler ride ons.  It was fine for an hour or two out of the house.  We will be back-my daughter loved the kitchen and vet play sets."}
{"text":"I am always searching for fun things to do with my 3-year-old son.  My mother-in-law happened to see a Groupon deal for EC Street and called to let me know about it.  I wasn't sure exactly what it would be like, but decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  It is very clean- the staff is always picking up toys (a neverending task with a place like this).  They mop the floors and seem to put a lot of effort into keeping things clean/sanitized.  The little rooms are so cute and they keep those well organized as well.  I was impressed with the variety of toys here.  There are so many different types of ride-on toys where they can drive on a little street with them.  There are so many activities for the kids here- the music stage in the back, crafts, the ball pit, the car wash, the little town rooms, etc.  There is a separate little area for babies with lots of toys in it, as well.  I've been here twice and spent close to 4 hours each time.  I love that you can stay as long as you want.  This will be a great indoor place to go this summer when it's scorching hot out.  I'd definitely recommend this place to others.  Friendly staff, clean and a LOT of stuff to do! =)"}
{"text":"I would have loved to give this place a better review. But here is a list of my pros and cons  Pros: Great little pretend store fronts. Lots of ride ons, tons of kitchen playfood, lots for crawlers and non crawlers. Great puzzles and lots of coloring pages.   Cons: Craft area is colder than rest of area. Not a lot of crayons, cafe is too large, takes up space that can be better utilized. Not enough places for parents to sit.   Overall this place is cute but a little disorganized."}
{"text":"A couple of months ago my wife and i were driving around with our son looking for something to do when we passed by EC Street. I looked them up on Google and was glad I did as it turned out to be where we ended up having his 2 year old birthday party. EC Street is a very clean, fun place with lots of toys for your babies and toddlers to play. The owner and her daughter and the rest of the staff are genuinely kind people. They helped us feel as if the party was at our house but without having to clean up afterwards. We really felt at home and so did all of our guests. The pricing is very reasonable there to host a birthday party. We had about 9 other kids between the ages of 1 and 5 years old at this party. Each one of them had a great time. One of the mothers that attended the party is going to have her sons party there later this year. Overall, its a great place with great people. Do not hesitate to go check EC Street out!!"}
