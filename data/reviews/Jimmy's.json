{"text":"Hollandaise sauce for eggs benedict made fresh daily; real potatoes, cubed and grilled; biscuits and gray from scratch... food is delicious, service is friendly, restaurant is clean. You can view the grill area as you pay to leave - it's clean and the owner is typically back there cooking. This place is worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday Brunch, the place was very crowded and busy however the wait staff was very efficient in getting our table ready and even though the food took a little while to come out it was well worth it.  Was our first visit but will  not be our last for sure!"}
{"text":"Great spot. You can tell they put love and passion into what they do. Started with the soup which clearly was made from scratch. Wonderful! Had a burger with Cajun fries. So good! Service is amazing! Server was genuinely friendly and attentive! Definitely a go to spot. Love the place!"}
{"text":"I was around the corner at Ava Lane Salon with my fiancee while he was getting his haircut.  We mentioned we were hungry and going out for lunch after the appointment.  She asked if we tried Jimmy's and we hadn't.  She suggested we give them a try because the food is so good.  Good enough for us, we decided to give it a try.
It was Saturday afternoon at lunch time and we were seated right away.  Small neighborhood eatery, very clean, friendly staff.  We ordered a couple raspberry teas, my fiancee and I ordered a chicken parmigiano and grilled chicken philly.  Both came with fries.  The sandwiches were excellent, the bread was so good, and the roasted garlic puree on it was so tasty.  The chicken parmigiano was tasty too, but could have used a bit more sauce.  The fries were soggy.

We will try this place again."}
{"text":"Awesome service, friendly atmosphere.  Good choices for vegetarians and very palatable.    Great diner!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were there for first time today and had breakfast .  My wife had the waffle combo and I had the pancake combo. Both come with eggs and choice of meat. We both had scrambled eggs and crisp bacon. It was all very good and the perfect size so we went away full but not uncomfortably so. The service was very good and friendly. There was a constant flow of people but never saw anyone having to wait more than a few minutes to be seated. We plan on going back to try lunch sometime in the near future. Unfortunately they are only open for dinner on Friday's until 8 so it may be a while before we can try dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely best family restaurant in lake county. Perfect hand cut, fresh food ... NOT mass produced. Coffee was good, food perfect, pricing just right! Take the whole family. Very friendly staff. This is our new Sunday go-to for breakfast and/or lunch!"}
{"text":"Going back for 2nd day in a row today!   Our group had late breakfast here yesterday...chorizo hash, southwestern omelet with chorizo and peppers, biscuits and gravy and perfectly cooked bacon.   
 
We were in the area for a wine country weekend,  no matter where you are staying, come to Jimmy's and get your breakfast.   Quaint atmosphere, excellent service, terrific food."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast & brunch place in town. Special menu for the summer season with many dishes that include fresh pineapple. I tried the grilled veggie wrap and it was very good! Came paired with hand cut fries and a pickle. Mom's summer pineapple chicken salad was full of flavor and included lots of toppings for an excellent and filling salad lunch. Friendly service and plenty of options will bring us back again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Nice little diner
The vegetable omelette was large enough for two
The chef salad was fresh and large 
The homemade  hash was great. 
Will be back again ."}
{"text":"Jimmys is a great place for breakfast or lunch. Always a great meal and great service."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service. Can't wait to go back.  The Italian wedding soup was so good we brought home a quart for later snacking. The fries were freshly cut. The French dip sandwich was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Good food. Portions were small though. The steak that came with someone's meal was to die for. That is saying a lot since I don't eat red meat normally. But I will come back for a steak one day. Not much parking available but there is some on the street and close walking distance. Plenty of room and did not have to wait to get a table on a Saturday although there were a lot of people. Lastly prices were cheap in comparison to most diners of the same sort and location."}
{"text":"Needed to pick up a quick breakfast, and they were more than accommodating to make us a couple of breakfast sandwiches to go. Had 1 burrito and 1 English muffin sandwich. Both were amazingly perfect! The chef and waitress were very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is a small diner and had a nice crowed for a Sat. Morning.Our waitress was great and quick on the coffee refills. All of our food came out HOT  and just the way we ordered it. Bacon is crispy! 

It was a little chilly in the place but when it's -5 outside.  Hard to keep warm anywhere."}
{"text":"I often have trouble understanding why some places get four or five stars. For Father's Day we decided to try this place for breakfast. Now I've lived by this place for many years but just have never found cause or reason to stop in there.

In general breakfast is pretty difficult to mess up. Eggs bacon Etc are all relatively easy to prepare. We stopped in about 11:45 a.m. because we figured the morning Rush would have had us waiting longer than we should have. The first thing I noticed when we walked into the place is there air conditioning is definitely sub-par. It was hot. Uncomfortable, humid, hot.  You can see yourself as long as there is an open table so I asked our server if the AC was on he said yes but it doesn't work very well. Rule number one of running a restaurant make sure it's comfortable or people won't come back.

My wife and I ordered iced tea and the kids just had water. The iced tea was more water than tea it was very very weak. I ordered an egg scramble with bacon which is where they chop up bacon and scrambled into the eggs which I do at home anyway. Out of habit I tend to time my order. The servers must have gotten the hint that I was less than enthused with their order turn around at the 30-minute Mark. At this point I was ready to get up and leave when the food finally showed up. I probably should have left.

It seemed like the eggs were overcooked and my Scramble came with bacon and sausage which was a nice surprise but it wasn't what I ordered. They were exceptionally greasy. I mean they were served in a pool of Grease. The red skin potatoes could have been fried better and when I say better I mean at all. The only thing that seemed to be on par was the toast if I had to find a positive.

My wife had a BLT which was unremarkable but the kids did seem to like their pancakes as they mentioned they were fluffy and really good which is the only thing that save this place from one star.

Hot and humid, long wait times, and food that is not good I will not be back."}
{"text":"I used to work in Painesville city, so my fiancé and I would frequently meet for lunch and we would come here a few times a month for lunch. The service isn't the best, even though its a tiny little hole in the wall. On a few different occasions our waitress (different ones) have taken a long time to give refills on our beverages or come to actually greet us or take our order. This is because we were in prime time lunch hour and it was usually almost packed when we were dining so I can forgive that. 

We've had various things on the menu from the wraps: chicken and tuna, the French dip sandwich, the seasonal rib sandwich, the Caprese burger, the jambalaya, and more. Neither one of us has not liked what we ordered. The food is pretty consistent and tasty, the fries are the shoestring type you get at fairs. The portions are a little small, but that's just because I'm used to oversized portions anyway. The strawberry chicken salad is raved about a lot, but I haven't tried it because I don't like fruit in my salads. Their homemade house salad dressing is pretty good. 

Out of all the Painesville faire, I prefer Jimmy's."}
{"text":"Always a great stop for breakfast and lunch. There is excellent food, and the owners/chefs go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied...excellent."}
{"text":"If you want breakfast and you're in the area, this place is THE place to go,  if not for their veggie omelet and homemade rye, alone. 

But then once you add in that you can feed 4 people breakfast for around $30, that makes it even better. 

The portions aren't smaller, as a few yelpers thought. My order was the same size, still served on smaller plates and I couldn't even finish the whole thing! Honestly, I had no idea you could fit that many veggies into an omelet, but they do and they do it well. And that damn toast... I want it in my kitchen at all times. I tasted some of their bacon, which is thick cut and perfectly cooked. 

You just can't go wrong here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch on a Saturday at 10:30 and was immediately able to get a table. I ordered the chorizo hash, which was phenomenal! My mom ordered an omelette and it was nice and fluffy. We both loved the thick rye toast. The food came out fast and hot and the service was great. It's definitely a gem in Lake County!"}
{"text":"Jimmy a is by far the best breakfast diner in Lake county.  Staff is beyond friendly, very attentive also.  Food is too notch and looks amazing.  We eat there at least once a week.  To top it of the prices are incredibly fair."}
{"text":"For a small neighborhood restaurant it was good. I gave the an extra star for the food being more than edible. Places like this I can't even finish the food but here really was good. Liked the Blue Cheese, it's mild but fresh flavor. The soup was the soup of the day. Kielbasa with sour kraut and egg noodles my Mom liked it. We split the sandwich and it was pretty good. This place is worth checking out if you want to eat in Painesville."}
{"text":"This is a great greasy spoon type of diner.  There aren't many tables and the service can be slow so be prepared to wait.  The chorizo hash and biscuits and gravy were delicious."}
{"text":"Home made,  what else can I say. If you like food not right out of a can stop in. Went with friend for lunch on Tuesday afternoon. Very clean and friendly staff. Had chicken Philly with a cup of Italian wedding soup. Soup was undoubtedly homemade probably the best I have had,  sorry mom.  Sandwich was on a roll that was perfect for the sandwich. Would order side of mayo with sandwich next time but  was very good. Chicken was not processed out of a bag, came in chunks with peppers onions and provolone.  Had some very interesting items on menu which I will try the next time. Chorizo hash sounds like a winner for my next visit.  Definitely a diamond in the rough. Do not hesitate going."}

{"text":"We stopped here due to the nice reviews we saw on Yelp. We always enjoy trying local restaurants. The only bad thing we can say about this place is that it's an hour away from where we live! However, the next time we're in the area, you can bet we'll be eating here! My wife ordered an omelet. She claimed it was one of the best she ever had. I'm not a big breakfast guy, so I had the (fresh) lake perch sandwich. They wisely only had a light batter on it, so it wouldn't detract from the flavor of the fish. Absolutely one of the best restaurants we've eaten at all year."}
{"text":"Jimmy was an awesome find.  My business partner and I frequent here for the best breakfast (Chorizo Hash) and awesome lunches.  I like the Rib sandwich.  Everyone is really friendly and professional.  I go here often and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast.  Lunches are good, too, but I love breakfast food.  Great place frequented by regulars and with good reason:  the food is great, the prices are good and the staff is friendly and attentive.  When he can, Jim comes out of the kitchen to say hi and ask how everything is.  Happy 10 year anniversary!"}
{"text":"We have been to Jimmy's a couple of times. We went there last winter and the food was pretty good and the service was fine. We went there for breakfast last week and were very disappointed. The plates were smaller, probably to make the portions look larger. My omelet was definitely smaller than the last time we were there. Also it didn't have sausage in it that I ordered. Our waitress was pleasant enough, but she disappeared after taking our order. We needed coffee refills and my wife had to get up and get the coffee pot herself."}
{"text":"Have been twice now for dinner( Friday only) and lunch.. Friday got the perch dinner, salad with Italian dressing( dressing was really good , salad itself was slightly above the usual as it was basically bagged with a few extras like cheese but at least fresh , not wilted browned edges like you get so often some places). Fries were good although I love the burnt butt ends of handcut type fries so maybe would get them well done. Husband had the special which was pork chop and it looked fantastic, not overcooked, plenty of juice, the rosemary roasted/fried potatoes were to die for (made him share). Didn't see any dessert but it probably would have been good lol. total about $22 so good deal
Lunch today was burger and wedding soup, again both good. Real handmade burger, slightly over cooked ( asked for med well and it was well) but good bun, good meat, juicy. Being a burger snob( hate the preformed patties most places serve) I will get another. $15 so not bad price again, husband got the BBQ bacon burger( or some similar named burger) and fries and liked it. Again the fries could have been a tad crisper. 
Love the people as well, friendly and seem genuinely interested in giving you a good meal.
Next up will be breakfast as the menu for that looked good too!

update! Breakfast today with parents and granddaughter. Two Jimmy's Basic Breakfast( 2 eggs, toast , meat, yummy potatoes from fresh potatoes, not frozen), kids mouse cakes( pancakes with ears and choice of meat) and one one egg/potatoes/toast. We are all neurotic about our eggs...one fried hard, one scrambled easy and one over so easy there is not a bit of hard yolk. I never ever get mine( the over extra easy) even close to how I want them any where...ALL three were exactly as ordered!!!  Potatoes were good( maybe a little more spice to jazz them a little but could have put the hot sauce on I guess. One toast was rye( thick sliced, would have been yummy if it were toasted) but not even browned, didn't send it back, figured the great eggs were enough lol.
So three for three, we are happy. Food isn't totally unusual, just home cooked freshly cooked goodness :)"}
{"text":"Amazing little spot. Chorizo and hash is my usual but if your lucky enough to go on \"chicken and waffle day\" GET IT! It should be on the menu!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here with my fiancee at the suggestion of the hair stylist at ava lane salon. Even though it was lunch time on a Saturday afternoon, we were seated right away  the restaurant is very clean. 
We order the chicken parm sandwich and chicken Philly sandwich, both with fries. The chicken parm sandwich was very tasty, but could have used a little more sauce, served on the side would be nice. If I get it again, I'll ask for that. The chicken Philly was excellent  the fries were to soggy for my taste. I prefer fries a bit more crispy 
We will definitely be back here when in the area."}
{"text":"If your looking to eat some where that feels like you are with family,  then Jimmy's is that place. Great food, made from scratch, the servers treat you as you are part of their family.  Why? You ask.  Because it is you that keeps them in business. 
They want to know how your meal was, and if it is not to your satisfaction, they will make it to your your satisfaction. 

Jimmy and his family strive to have you leave their establishment saying \" this is our second home, we will be back every week\".  
If you don't believe me, stop in and find out for yourself."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat!! The owner is friendly and is normally working with his staff. The breakfast is always good with nice size portions!! Lunch is amazing and the soups are always good. A nice little resturant that you can feel welcome at. Always has Great service and great food. If you are in painesville stop at Jimmys you wont regret it."}
