{"text":"I've been to Park Place several times because my parents are regulars, and know the entire staff, including the owner, Mike a great guy, who will routinely converse with his customers and have a good laugh, usally at Donald Trumps expense. Food here is fantastic, everything is made fresh and homemade, the seafood sauce with your choice of pasta, is absolutely mouth-watering, and a bit spicy, their roast beef will melt in your mouth, the pizza is fresh and delicious... durring the lunch rush, but they do leave it out for people straggling in at later times. Their roasted veggies and salads are refreshing, and makes you actually want veggies for lunch. Park Place has a wonderful atmosphere, were the tables are so big, you are always going to be sitting next to a new friend, whom you can watch the world cup with, on the massive projector Mike turns on when Italy is playing."}
{"text":"this review is based solely on the pizza. i came here and saw it was $2.50-$3 for one slice. It was just on the counter mushed in with the other left overs. the server there just picked it up and put it in a brown bag with her barehands. the pizza was cold and i was given no option to heat it up. Its good for a last minute dont care want pizza craving..but if you want better pizza.. go to the one called polletis in the same plaza. more money but fresh and warm.. better than this last minute slice. i came just to see if it was worth it. and i wont be returning. Thanks."}
{"text":"I love their veal sandwiches. I work close by and when I'm craving veal for lunch I always go here. They cater too! So I have had their pastas and other entrees, and they taste like homemade which is key in Italian food... IMO.   Although, I went last week and they raised their prices and the sandwich buns were smaller... That kinda turned me off."}
