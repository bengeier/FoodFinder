{"text":"My family always enjoys coming here. They have the perfect menu and great service. I have four kids between the ages six and twelve and they all love it here! We're not from around here, but this is our favourite place to eat."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Cranberries completely out of the blue. We were a couple of west-enders \"trapped\" in the east-end of town and had no idea what's good. It seemed pretty cheap and had the sweet potato fries we were hankerin' for. The place was about 1/3 full on a thursday night. It's very...wooden inside. Very homey. It kind of reminded me of a small town pub. My friend said it reminded her of a few places she would frequent in her hometown in Nova Scotia. Our waiter was very friendly, fast and attentive. A bit of an odd ball, but in a charming kind of way. We each ordered a salad, mixed greens and then a greek salad. My greek salad was WAY too over dressed, but the fries were great! We also ordered wine and ended up \"toasting\" to Cranberries, partly as a joke...partly because we were surprised how good a restaurant called Cranberries could be. I almost think we were in a haze of mediocrity. It kind of tickled us how NORMAL and medium this restaurant is. No gimmicks, no frills, just simple regular, good food at good prices. Imagine that! It's revolutionary really...I will always recommend Cranberries. Again, partly as a joke...partly because it actually kinda rules. Let it linger."}
{"text":"Wanting to brings friends from out of town out for dinner, we chose one of our favourites. Cranberries is a short walk from home, and have always enjoyed the laid back, friendly atmosphere, and excellent food. As it was a rainy Pride Day Sunday, and they were very busy, we were seated in a side dining room we had not know was there. The room was quiet and comfortable so we were happy with our table. The special of the day, roast beef came highly recommended by our veteran waiter ( the staff is a mix of young and seasoned ) and we were very appreciative for the advice, as the roast came with salad, mash potatoes, vegetables, and bread pudding. All of which were excellent! Even though we could see that the restaurant was busy, we never felt rushed in any way. 

All and all, an excellent dinner with friendly and professional service. We will bring friends here again."}
{"text":"This cosy lil place feels like home to me. I ordered the chicken souvlaki and was very satisfied. The chicken and tzatsiki were delicious, Greek salad was good, and even the rice was yummy. My companions ordered chicken wings and chicken chimichangas, respectively, and were very happy with their meals. After dinner I had an Irish whisky, which was also fantastic.

I definitely recommend this place if you want a filling meal in cosy atmospherel! But if you are a vegetarian, I would avoid - I didn't see any vegetarian dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Eating at Cranberries is like walking into your grandmother's kitchen, so warm and comforting.  Nothing pretentious about this place, just good home-style food.  It's one of the few places that you can go for quick, friendly breakfasts at a diner price.  If you find yourself there at lunch or dinner be sure to start with one of their soups, made from scratch.  I love that they often have gazpacho on rotation but if you want something to warm your soul go for a brimming bowl of minestrone; so good that no-one will blame you for slurping!"}
{"text":"I love Cranberries! I used to live in St James Town, and it's definitely one of the nicest places around to dine-in (and affordable too).

The only con is that sometimes it's busy and there's usually only two servers working, so sometimes they don't check in on you too often. Order a pitcher of water upon your arrival so that you don't have to worry about them coming back to fill your glass. The food is brought out punctually, so no worries about that.

The atmosphere is subdued and nice. Dark wood paneling and booths. It's an excellent place to bring a date.

They also do take-out if you're alone and too shy to dine-in."}
{"text":"Came here twice in the last couple months.  The first time we got a chicken and seafood salad I believe, and the wings and ribs combo.  I thought they were both delicious and my friend couldn't stop raving about the salad for weeks.

We went again and got voodoo chicken penne, buffalo butts, Mexican chimichangas, and red velvet cake.  Great portions, all delicious.  I've been craving buffalo butts again for days.  (I think that's the weirdest sentence I've ever written)"}
{"text":"I agree with the person who says it is like walking into your Grandmothers kitchen. Not so much since the bakery next door moved (then the feeling was completed by the warming scent of fresh baked apple pie)  but wonderful.
Welcoming staff and good unassuming home cooked meals.
Love it!"}
{"text":"Went here with my mom for a dessert. I ordered an apfel strudel and it tasted just as good as the ones I had over in Austria! Mom had some cheesecake something or other and really loved it, too. Haven't had anything else there yet, but the atmosphere is great, the crowd relaxed and the service was perfect. Wonderful place."}
{"text":"Usually I love this place. For the most part I go during the day when my favorite waitress is working. She is a delight. The owner/chef is around at this time as well. The orders are consistently good and the service fabulous making you want to return. Normally I order the blackened chicken salad and homemade soup. All are great.
The other night attending with my daughter and family and friends the food was not so great which is disappointing especially when you have raved about the food to those who are newcomers to the restaurant. Every time my daughter is in Toronto this is a must visit place. Her chicken souvlaki was inedible. The meat arrived cut into tiny pieces of burnt offering. The roast beef dinner special was ordered medium rare but served well done. The salad and dessert which came with the meal were great.
The chicken butts were tiny bits of dried up meat when usually they arrive tender and juicy albeit larger and fewer in numbers. 
My son's chicken wings were up to his usual standard so he was not disappointed. 
My blackened chicken salad arrived the way I expected it to. 
My grandchildren enjoyed their grilled cheese sandwiches and sweet potato fries.
Overall we were disappointed. r5edfc  The guest of honor were the ones who received the food which arrived unsatisfactory. Usually this is a go to place we can rely on.  
I will continue to patronize this place during the day when I can depend on the quality of the food and enjoy the wonderful service from my favorite waitress."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today, SO happy I did! From the outside I wasn't sure what to expect but don't let this fool you. Went for brunch, the Caesar I had and breakfast wrap were on point. Prices were super reasonable, service was friendly and the food was delicious. I'll be back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"This place was nicer inside than I expected. Went with a friend who recommended them for their 79 cent wings on Mondays. 
Wings were nicely sized, not puny little things with no meat.  
I got honey garlic on my wings, it was a mediocre sauce-I have had better and worse. 
We shared a sticky toffee pudding for dessert that was really tasty.  And the staff was busy but polite. 
Would return for wing night special."}
{"text":"I'm going to create a Yelp list soon of \"places that kept me alive when I first arrived in Toronto\" and this place is going to top it.

Cosy atmosphere, friendly staff, ridiculously reasonable prices, huge menu selection and even huger portions.

Oh, and DELICIOUS food. Their spicy chicken pieces (I believe they call them buffalo butts or something?) deserve to be world famous. Honestly, they are the best chicken dippers/pieces I have ever had. Tender, spicy and addictive! Added points for the value and the fact they are served boneless!

Even a Caesar salad here left me stuffed! How that's even possible, I don't know, but this place achieved it!

They have specials on every night with different deals offering extra value for money, so it's well worth multiple visits to explore different parts of the menu.

What can I say, everything about this place is fantastic. It's also in an amazing, very underrated part of Toronto, which is definitely worth exploring (if you can move after your glorious meal)"}
{"text":"Good Home-style food served with some flare. We started with Bruschetta which was more than enough to share. The flavours were outstanding and the bread was broiled just right to be crispy and easily manageable. I had the Liver & Onions which also came with bacon. The presentation was very pleasing and flavour was excellent. Bob had the Blackened Halibut which was also served with a little pizzazz and very tasty, I had to sample. The only note was the garnish on the fish was not for anyone who does not liked a little heat/spice to their food. Service was pleasant and attentive..... 
A good deal for a good price and impresses anyone who visits the restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly neighborhood restaurant with delicious food, friendly staff and very reasonable prices.  This is one of those no-frills comfort food places that just makes you feel good every time you come here.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Live in the neighborhood went on a Sunday afternoon hung over as hell didn't know what I felt like eating my friend ordered a cheeseburger I ordered the steak and eggs. Steak and egg were okay the usual but I really wish I would've ordered the cheeseburger holy cow what was I thinking took a bite and I was in heaven awesome!! Had to go back and get my own cheeseburger which I did and it was worth every bite."}
{"text":"It has a small town feel to it, this place, kind of like stepping into another dimension, possibly one in the 70's. 
The wait staff were all very friendly in that local genuine way, which is so nice to find downtown! Food was served with speed and let me tell ya- the beef dip! Many recommended, and let's face it, a sandwich made of garlic bread is going to be amazing. Gravy was excellent! (That's the second time this month I've come across amazing gravy! :D) 
This place is good for a quiet dinner with an old friend. It offers parties and whatnot but I don't know if I would like the noise level in such a small space. One thing that kind of bugged me was that they wouldn't give us a booth. They said they required them for groups of 3 or more. It was a Monday- not exactly known for overcrowding. I suppose they have their rules and reasons, but boooooooooo(th) to that. 
But hey if that's the only thing to complain about, then I would say the pros out weigh the con. :P"}
{"text":"Love the food and the service!  Great value!  Whoever said the fries are disappointing, I do not agree, I LOVE their poutine!  They earned only 4 stars because they took my fave (beef or pork brisket off of the menu) and my bestie who is a deep fried pickle maniac says theirs are too breaded.. otherwise, we always leave happy!"}
{"text":"Great Comfort food...especially the wings. The quality and price will surprise you!"}
{"text":"A great neighbourhood restaurant with a pub feel. Nightly specials available. Food is awesome. I've never had something I didn't enjoy. A must try!"}
{"text":"Cranberries (or the \"cranhole\" as we have affectionately termed it) is our default go-to spot over the last 7 years. The staff is friendly, the prices are great and the food is pretty darn good. Nothing fancy, but a solid plate of fresh-made goodness each and every time. The burgers are excellent, fresh patties, not frozen pre-mades, and the fries are hand-cut. We've probably eaten through the entirety of the menu, and there is nothing we wouldn't eat again. Their wings are excellent and Monday night's wing special is worth a visit, my husband is in love with the Chicken Parmesan (and the brunch offering of the breakfast wrap with sausage). Nothing like a meal and a pint (currently rocking Beau's and GLB on tap) at Cranberries."}
{"text":"Always consistent in service and quality of food. Portion size could be a bit more. But The meat is marinated just right."}
{"text":"Cranberries was recommended by a friend, I can understand why!

Quality food, varied menu, NOT a burger joint but rather a nice place with quality dishes created by someone who cares about return business.

All three of us started with soup, I had Gazpacho, my friends had French Onion and Seafood Chowder. All were very good and from scratch with fresh ingredients.

Two of us had the special which was a penne with shrimp and chicken in a slightly spicy rose sauce.
Sauce was from scratch and shrimp was done perfectly. Portion was good sized and filled me nicely.
Our third had spicy chicken butts, they we spicy and tasty!

The service was prompt and efficient AND the waitress had a personality that made the meal extra special.

This will go on my list of regular stops.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Had Christmas dinner there for the second year in a row.  Meal was excellent.  I have a son who is wheelchair bound, and this place was totally accessible which, unfortunately, is a rarity.  Will be back, that is for sure!!"}
{"text":"Best comfort food this side of Parliament.  Don't miss Monday's beer and wings night because they r plumb, juicy and dusted to perfection.  Way better than Duff's.  Seeu Monday night :)"}
{"text":"Ended up going over with a large group. Stumbled on this place by accident. We all surfed and turfed and we got to try a bunch of items. We saw the waiter carry over an interesting app called the cheese puffs and immediately had to order it. Verdict ; Interesting-lets leave it at that ! I had ordered the chimichangas and was expecting something else: something more cheesy and gooey. Wasnt the genuine chimichanga experience im used to. More like a really good wrap with salsa. Lets just say it was my least favourite item. Now to get to the good parts- the WINGS!! giant well coated wings that was flavourful and sauced up perfectly. GREAT!! what was actually the highlight of the place was definitely their pasta! Hats off to the chef- he knows how to handle linguine. Every plate was flavourful and cooked perfectly. We ordered the chicken and shrimp cappelini and also the fettucini alfredo. To top it off there was steak ordered and it was grilled and seasoned great!! Overall my experience at red cranberries was great. Mostly since it wasn't planned and the surprising result was high quality food with good portions at a more then fair price! Especially the steak!!!"}
{"text":"One of those nights when you crave for chicken wings, I began searching for \"best wings\" around downtown Toronto. The usual pops up - Real Sports, Duff's Wings, All Stars (and I have tried all of them multiple times) until I scrolled to a place that I did not expect to have such amazing chicken wings - Red Cranberries Restaurant! 

The place is small but street parking is fairly easy to find on Parliament. The restaurant was pretty busy, but we were able to get a table immediately. I ordered my \"Hot Jumbo Wings\" right away and waited patiently. When those wings arrived, I have to say it looked plain.........until you try one of them! It was so different and extremely flavourful than any other wings I have tried all over the bars in the GTA!!!  Those wings deserve three exclamation marks. With or without the dip on the side, they were great! The fries that came with the wings, however, were disappointing. Oh well, I came here for the wings! I haven't tried their drinks or any other dishes, but I will soon return to try other dishes and to those wings again!"}
{"text":"Rhank (yes on purpose) you for the despicable service and food. There is a certain discernment considering what hour it was 10:00 pm. Just because you're from the east coast and you might have a hard time getting the food served to the three patrons of your concern, the thousands of dollars ive dropped in your establishment could have been greeted with even remote appreciation. Believe me; the food isnt good enough to be treated like shit on top. 
Thanks for ALLOWING ME to OVERTIP 25% because  I feel so fucking bad for you i wouldnt want you people to go home with more depression than you must already have.
Thanks for taking my money."}
{"text":"This place was very cozy. They were very accommodating with the menu options. The beer they offer was good and the food was plentiful. The only ding I'd give is a seafood pasta dish with shrimp & scallops only had one scallop. My husband ordered it solely for the scallops too lol. The staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone is so in love with this place so much, but it is good. There are only 2 reasons this place is even getting 4 stars - the deep fried pickles and the chicken wings.
The deep fried pickles had an overpoweringly dill element which almost made them seem extra seasoned with dill and had a very unique breading around it. Unlike any other deep fried pickle I've had, and was impressed. The chicken wings were also super tasty with just the right amount of crispyness and medium saucing. Good stuff on those fronts.

On the down side were the ribs. They were fall off the bone but the meat just seemed low grade, really didn't enjoy them at all. Boring beer selection too, mostly overpowered with lager and pilsner and nothing with real character or bold flavour. Service was spotty and on a slow weeknight with the place half empty they still only let groups of 3 or more sit in a booth. 

I'll probably give this place a go again just for the wings and deep fried pickles, not feeling to encouraged to branch out otherwise though."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night with a friend. Wasn't busy because the Taste of Danforth was on. I got the Voodoo Chicken Penne, my friend got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and we both really enjoyed our meals. The food prices are very good. The apple martini I had was also delicious. The staff are friendly and very funny. Next time I'm in Cabbage Town, I'd definitely go back. :)"}
{"text":"I think I have paid my last visit to Cranberries! Been coming regularly almost weekly for the last 3 to 4 years, but now its time to find something else. Cranberries has gotten into the habit of reducing portions rather than raising prices. The portions get smaller and smaller every time I go. The last straw was Fish and Chips, which USED to be a huge piece of whitefish in a fluffy delicious batter with a mountain of fries. This time even Captain Highliner would have been embarrassed.  Half the fries were on sabbatical and the fish was a shadow of its former self.
As I don't drink alcohol, Diet Coke is my bevvie of choice. They serve Coke from a can and I have watched the price shoot up waaaay past the price that ayce refill places charge. Gotta find me a new digs. Maybe with the increase profits from the soda sales they can afford to hire an upholsterer for the booths and a painter for the doorways."}
{"text":"I use to come to this place very often and I loved it. 
But for some reason it changed, they r super rude and do not acknowledge the customers.
Last two times I went to have brunch it took forever for someone to ask us to seat and the food took a super long time and everytime we askes for something they will take the time and keep forgeting things.
And then the next time the same took forever to let us have a seat (and there was tables available) then when we finally sat down, we waited at the table for about 10 mins, the waitress passed by us 5 times, we did not have a menu and not even drinks, so we stand up and when we going towards the door to leave, the server yelled at us that she was going to be with us in a second and came running to take our order.
We just left and we are not coming back, such a shame, i use to like the food.

Never going back again :("}
{"text":"A hidden gem! You would never know by the looks of this place from the outside.  Food has never disappointed me so far.  The prices are fair, portions are more than enough and the service is excellent.  They have a special every night of the week which makes you want to go eat there everyday.  I've only been there twice now. Sunday (Prime Rib Steak with veggies and mashed potatoes for $14.99 or Roast beef dinner with soup or salad, veggies, Yorkshire pudding and dessert $17.99).  The first time I'd gone was a Monday ($0.70 jumbo wings - max 10, but like I said they are jumbo sized or you can order the shepherds pie - haven't tried yet, but looked delish when I saw others ordering it).  I also have eaten their bruschetta which is great to share for an appetizer between 4 people and it's absolutely the way I like it (soft and crispy/toasted) at the same time.  The chicken and shrimp pasta was large and cooked very well.  Again this place is a hidden gem and now that I've found it I will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Top notch find on Parliament..
I really like the staff, quick service.
NY steak is fantastic!  Very good coffee.
I like this place a LOT!"}
{"text":"OMG what an awesome upgraded Mom and Pop place! The food is all home made and so very tasty! Great portions and friendly staff in a comfortable restaurant. Definitely going to be one of my regular spots from now on!"}
{"text":"I was so surprised with the huge portion sizes for very affordable prices.  The food was delicious and the place is very classy - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cozy place with yummy food. I usually get steak here, it's very tasty! I love the mashed potatoes especially."}
{"text":"A Very nice cozy clean restaurant at amazing prices. Service was exceptional. We had the cornbeef hash($9), pancake ($7) and breakfast special($6) for a Saturday brunch. Brunch starts at 9am to 3pm on Saturdays and Sundays.

THE BEST PANCAKE IN CANADA. OMG!!!! MAYBE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. I LOVE IT LOVE IT. 

I really love this place.  Standing ovation!!! Clap clap clap. I found my new Hotspot for brunch in my amazing city."}
{"text":"I go here at least every four to six weeks with friends after evening church service. The grilled salmon is delicious and great value for the price. Great desserts and as well full bar."}
{"text":"Waiter was super nice. We were from out of town and he was very helpful in giving us suggestions for our trip. Food was great and cheap! They don't open til 11 during the week, which was a little disappointing because we would have gone back for breakfast more than once, but It was still a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Their grilled calamari is always tender and never overcooked. This flavorful staple has never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hey Cranberries!!)))
You do very very good job!!!
I've been twice. First my visit was with family for lunch. Good portions, nice atmosphere, very friendly staff. I ordered club sandwich with fries, my wife soup of the day and we shared a wings. Everything was excellent!!!
We came back for dinner. And was very happy!!!
Another servers, but also friendly and professional)
I ordered Pork Rib's, my wife Salmon with mashed potatoes. All meals comes with steam veggies. Very good portion, absolutely delicious!!! With beers and tax and tips bill was 68$
Guys! Thank you! 
I recommend you all my friends!!!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try Red Cranberries. Their menu looked like someone with no theme or vision was like \"these different foods are all my favourite, so I'm going to put them on a menu\" and did. I was okay with that because *blushes* they were all my favourite too!
My friend wanted brunch, a sign outside said all day brunch. I wanted pasta.
We walked into Red Cranberries at 11:30 and there was only one other table in there.
We asked the server of we could have a booth and she said \"they're only for tables of 3 or more\". We argued for a little bit, saying okay, but there's no one else here.
Nope. She said it was a rule and it gets \"packed at lunch time\".
Fine. We sat at a table by the window.
We asked if they had a brunch menu and she told us it was only on Sundays (maybe Saturday's too, I can't remember).
Oh. Dang.
We ordered coffees while we decided on what we wanted.
The cream that was given to my friend was spoiled. Our server brought fresh cream.
We saw there was french onion soup and borscht on the menu and we were super excited to try both. They're two of my favourite soups.
I got a chicken burger and borscht and my friend got a BLT and french onion soup.
My burger wasn't bad. It didn't have any condiments on it so I asked for mayo on the side.
The BLT wasn't bad either.
The borscht was not what I was expecting. It had a lot of sour cream in it. It was decently good, but not outstanding. 
The French onion soup, though it looked good, did not taste good. We left it.
Only one other table came in the hour that we were there.
And guess what. They were a table of 2 and were seated at a booth..."}
{"text":"Been here for brunch several times and it's always been a pleasant experience. It almost had a small town feel to it with the friendly staff and very attentive and fast waitresses. I've only ever had brunch fair (bacon and eggs) so I can't comment on the more complicated menu items but the food I've eaten there has been great. Really enjoy myself here."}
{"text":"Had been meaning to try this place for a long time, now that my kitchen is being renovated - now was the time.

So we ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs and the Voodoo Chicken Penne, and both were great, especially considering we did take out.

The pasta tasted fresh, the sauces were very tasty, the meatballs juicy and lots of them, and the grilled chicken on the penne was perfectly cooked.  

The garlic bread was ok, but next time we will skip the extra order of garlic bread with cheese - nothing exciting, would have preferred just plain bread.

Funniest part of the visit:  the guy at the cash recognized me as a friend of a friend on Facebook!  Small world.

We will be back, both for take out and dine in."}
{"text":"I had the days special. Flat bread pizza with whatever toppings I wanted..form a list. It was pretty damn good...a bit dry but I got a beer so things evened out. Our waitress was also super kind and made sure we had our drinks filled. Nice and quaint."}
{"text":"Solid dependable well priced family style meals.  Friendly service.  It's absolutely my 'down home' 'go-to.'"}
{"text":"I came to this unassuming place through the recommendation of a friend and I was very pleased.
The service was quick. Even though the restaurant was full we got served right away.
Portions are a fair size and prices are decent.
Very casual atmosphere.
Everything looked great on the menu - I'll definitely be coming back again.

PS. Their Apple Crumble was delicious!"}
{"text":"Boo. Not the place for burgers and fries. Just looking for casual fare, but disappointed. I've had better poutine at Costco. Wings...meh. They probably taste better if you've had LOTS of beer. Good atmosphere and good service tho."}
{"text":"Cranberries - what it lacks in atmosphere it makes up for with wings, especially on a Monday night when there's a deal.

The food is standard pub/ North American fair, but done well enough to make this a reliable food stop in the Cabbagetown area.

Lighting is bright, seats and decor aren't up to much, but friendly staff, cold drinks and those delicious wings make for a decent option."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my girlfriend and brought my baby. Was very disappointed they did not have a high hair.  I have never been to an eatery that did not have a high chair.  This made lunch complicated and not the most enjoyable. The cheese puffs and buffalo butts were good, nachos disappointing,  the waitress was very friendly.  I would not recommend this place to any family's with small children"}
