{"text":"Pretty cool place (in addition to the name).  My daughters split a pizza that was quite tasty, and my spicy turkey sandwich was very nice.  This is a clearly more bakery than restaurant or coffee shop, so we will need to come to try the croissants, baguettes and pastry.  It does provide a cleanly decorated, light atmosphere to hang out.  All in all, a nice Fathers' Day experience to bike ride here with my daughters and check out a new place. 

(Note:  We did not bring in outside food like the fool who wrote a bad review because she was caught doing so.  That person seems to miss who was at fault.)"}
{"text":"Flaky, buttery, deliciousness in a clean modern space. I hunt down pastries in all the cities and little towns I visit and this place is a find. There is nothing like walking into a pastry shop and being welcomed with the smell of dough, butter and sugar coming together in the oven. The Kouign Amann was as buttery a pastry as I have ever had, even in France. Good coffee completes it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I like  this cafe a lot. 
Croissants are fresh and they taste really good. I have tried regular one, the almond croissant and another caramelized one. Apple danish is delicious too. 
My husband likes their coffee. 
And Spacious, quite, free wifi, good for sitting, eating, studying, and friendly staffs. 
A friend of mine said pizza is delicious too. I will definitely go back to try it out next time!"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant and fresh food that tasted wonderful. We had a couple of sandwiches and a pizza. Only comment would be that is took quite awhile to come out of the kitchen, but that's to be expected for fresh food."}
{"text":"I always try to stop by The Fluffy Duck Cafe when in the area. Regarding the pastries: i've tried the Savory Scone and the Kouign Amann, both were delicious! Seems like a newer cafe; the interior is pleasant. The bathrooms say \"whichever\" and I thought that was clever. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of my friends know about this place since it's a bit far from campus, but the Pastries here are SO GOOD. 
Everything you get here is way better than any other bakery nearby- perfect to just sit and chill or just grab on the go.

Their coffee is also pretty good, clean/cute interior, friendly staff"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and GO! From the perfectly made croissants that remind me of Thomas Keller's Bouchon to the baguette that brings me home to South Louisiana, Fluffy Duck Cafe is firing on all cylinders! At first I thought that their competition should be concerned, but now I know that they should be alarmed because Fluffy Duck is the best bakery in Northeast Ohio! They are not open on Sundays but don't worry that gives you six days of wonderfully baked goods."}
{"text":"every pastry I've tried here is excellent. Sandwiches are a little pricey for what you get. Coffee is delicious and it's pleasant to sit in there and visit or study."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday afternoon with sis in-law I liked how spacious, bright and clean it is and definitely love the cute duck art. The croissant and Latte was yum. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Fluffy Duck Cafe has a clean and bright atmosphere, top notch coffee from Madcap out of Grand Rapids, and some of the best pastry in Cleveland. I often stop in for a black coffee and light conversation after work and I'm never disappointed. Skill and care go into every product the owners make; it's a joy to sit and watch Ben make dough for various offerings.

If you need a refreshing stop for breakfast, lunch, or a study break (and can appreciate the highest quality pastry/coffee combo in Cleveland) don't hesitate to give Fluffy Duck Cafe your business!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places in Cleveland for freshly baked pastries. It's also a quiet and very clean place to have a warm conversation with your friends without noisy background."}
{"text":"Decent coffee place, super close to Cleveland Clinic. The menu is pretty limited- but their baguettes are high quality! They are true baguettes with a nice hard crust and a decent price ($3.50). I got a pot of green tea and was a little confused. It literally tasted like steeped seaweed? Nevertheless, the cappuccino was decent and the cafe clean and bright."}
{"text":"This bakery may have my favorite croissants in the Cleveland area. Their baked goods are huge and wait for it... fluffy! The croissant was perfectly crisp but also baked to have consistent, fluffy layers. I've also tried their savory goods and it's all excellent.
Located in the Innova building off Chester, they have 15 min street parking around the corner if necessary. Hoping that as the medical and dental schools are completed, the area will become more walkable (urban planning nerd here.) The cafe itself has about 20-25 seats with free WiFi- good for stopping in for work or leisure. Very clean and modern look and they sell madcap coffee - go visit them!"}
{"text":"Amazing bread! The pizza is awesome and it's a really cool spot for some coffee and studying."}
{"text":"Love this place. Solid coffee. Chill people. Simple and tasty sandwiches. Best croissants."}
{"text":"Great place for sandwiches, pizza, pastry, coffee, etc. There people here are very nice and you can tell they do everything with quality. Definitely recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Looking for the largest croissant you can buy? I think this place has them. They have a huge sheeter cranking out a variety of savory and sweet croissants. I loved the Kouign Amman and the ham and cheese croissant. Very tasty chai latte, too."}
{"text":"When I ordered the croissant and they gave me something that damn near filled a medium sized plate, I though there is no way this thing could be good. I was wrong. Not sure why the size was so expansive, but the treat was buttery and delicious. 

Wish the coffee was a little better, but I encourage your trying the Duck. Just don't be intimidated by the size of the pastry!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly.  I got the orange cardamom latte and it was delightful.  The orange cardamom flavoring is homemade! Not overpowering.  The croissants looked amazing."}
{"text":"Charmed, I'm sure you'll be. Fluffy Duck is almost as adorable as its name, and located on the ground floor of the Innova residential building. Walking inside was a little like stepping into a meditation room filled with pastries. Peaceful, clean, white walls and counters, wooden furniture, and of course, the smell of fresh bread. As I perused the menu and baked goods (kouign amanns!!), I could see the open kitchen space just beyond, where staff were busy rolling out dough and prepping other sorts of tempting things.

The tea is served in afternoon tea worthy china - it practically begs to be photographed. The teapot for some reason though kept sticking to the countertop when I tried to pick it up. I'm not sure if this was a poor-design thing, sticky surfaces, or just an artifact of tea drip. Some of the food items were a little on the pricier side, but my Turkey Sandwich did have avocado and was layered with absolutely delicious bread. The Ham Sub Sandwich and pizza options were more economical and I'm sure scrumptious as well. 

As previously mentioned, free Wi-Fi is available. You'll find some charging outlets near the window seats, but if you're just there to enjoy a nice lunch or conversation, the tables will do very nicely. Two any-gender bathrooms along the far side. It was very quiet when I went, with only a few people coming in and out during the lunch hour, which made it a great place to study. I'm conflicted since I'd rather not have to compete for prime laptop space as it becomes busier. But, I do hope Fluffy Duck starts getting the attention it deserves to keep swimming along!"}
{"text":"Spacious indoors with lots of natural lighting! Got a yummy almond croissant here. It was different from other places that do an almond paste filling, but the soft cookie dough topping with crisp almond slivers was a great balance to the airy and rich croissant"}
{"text":"An excellent cafe occupying an attractive, contemporary storefront that serves quality coffee, baked goods, and light bites. 

Savory items like a cheddar scone, as well as sweet items like a kouign amann, were all high-quality and begin to approach the levels seen at world-class bakeries and pastries in big cities like New York and the Bay Area. Yet you won't get big-city prices here; everything is quite reasonable on the wallet given the portion sizes and quality. Coffee drinks are delicious too; they use Madcap beans.

Service, while dotting all the \"i\"s and crossing all the \"t\"s from a professional perspective, can be a bit perfunctory in tone, but if the cafe is quiet and uncrowded, you're absolutely welcome to be a laptop loiterer for a good period of time. Yet another great find thanks to all you Yelpers out there!"}
{"text":"Delicious breads and sandwiches. Free wifi. Nice espresso drink options -- & delicious! One star off because young woman working was unfriendly and it seemed like we were bugging her to be there."}
{"text":"I just moved from DC to Cleveland and I have been looking for some good places to read a book and have great coffee.  This is the best place I've found so far.  Wonderful coffee with fresh artisanal bread and pastries made in house.  I was impressed with my experience.  This is more of a pastry/bread shop that also sells good coffee/lattes."}
{"text":"The selection is somewhat limited (they did open within the past month). I split the margarita pizza with my younger sister; it was absolutely delicious. It was a slight bit oily, but the sauce was herb-y and excellent."}
{"text":"The chef at The 9 recommended I check this place out, and I'm sure glad we did.  Had the almond croissant, loaded with flavor, and the texture was perfect.  Also had a caramelized croissant, cant remember the name, but was amazing.  Welcome to the neighborhood, we will be back for a flatbread.  The Chef/Owner wasnt in while we were there, but we met his father who was very helpful and proud of his son.  The host/manager was very friendly and helpful as well."}
{"text":"A truly special little coffee shop. The drinks and food are 100%% amazing. Great natural light, sturdy good sized tables, solid wifi - overall makes for a great place to grab some breakfast or lunch, or also an amazing place to study!"}
{"text":"Great place to study and enjoy awesome coffee and pastries! All of their breads and pastries are made in-house and fresh daily. The latte/cappuccino flavors are creative (I.e., orange cardamom, local honey, etc) and taste great. They also have free wifi, which is a plus for any students who live near here and need a good study spot. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Amazing pastries, freshness unlike any other place I have experienced. Drinks are above average as well. Started as 4 stars but finished as 5 after another trip."}
{"text":"Delicious baked goods with unique offerings like the walnut and date scone, which I highly recommend. I particularly like the texture of their scones which are a little flaky and crispy as opposed to the bland and cakey ones I've had at other places. Other great things to try are their almond croissants. If you go in the morning, you can get them fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"I love this place... the look of it... the environment... the location... the food... to me it's all perfect! 
I don't know how they have successfully created an oasis of calm in the middle of chaos(CCF is right around the corner, there's ongoing construction,kinder care is one door away). Regardless, this space definitely has serene charm about it. 
I love the fact that they don't have a ginormous menu with everything in the kitchen sink on it! The menu is selective and varies with products available. A bonus... they make their own breads! 
I tried the ham baguette sandwich off the lunch menu and while the bread was a little tough for my liking, the bite of the sandwich on its whole was perfect! The dressing(don't know what it was but it was delicious),ham and the bread all came together just perfectly!!

They don't do soups in summer. Will definitely be back to sample more of their offerings!

A true gem of an addition to this area!"}
{"text":"Such a gorgeous place. I'm a chai tea lover and theirs is one of the best I've had yet. All natural and custom made by them with organic milk as well. Delish!"}
{"text":"The latte is just mediocre at its best and it's definitely not worth over $4. Stick to Phoenix coffee instead."}
{"text":"I recently took a French cooking class and my teacher recommended the Fluffy Duck Cafe! She said the food was phenomenal and it truly was. I ordered an Apple Danish, a Kouign Amman, and a pourover coffee- all were excellent. The pastries were light and buttery, but not too dry. The coffee was bold and flavorful! However, we initially did not receive a great welcome. I went with some friends and we were all thrilled to be there! The cashier did not respond to our enthusiasm and almost seemed to be annoyed with us. The food here was excellent, but I cannot say the same about the customer service. I hope our unfortunate encounter was a one-time experience because this is a great cafe and I don't want others to get discouraged to try it due to poor customer service."}
{"text":"Mmmm fresh baked bread. Fluffy Duck might become my go-to coffee shop. Clean, modern interior feels very open and spacious with lots of natural sunlight from the clear windows. Very relaxing ambiance.

The pour over coffee is great and as good as Rising Star or Pour with a better price point ($4.50 for a cup). What knocked this place out the park was the food. They have a more extensive menu than you expect at a coffee shop with different sandwiches, pizzas and salads. I ordered the turkey sandwich and it was delicious. The rye bread, which they bake in-house, was the perfect texture of chewy/crispy and had a distinct wheat flavor you don't get from store bread. Wonderfully constructed supporting ingredients with fresh tomato, lettuce and juicy turkey slices.

I will be back here soon! Can't wait to try a pizza here."}
{"text":"If I lived in Cleveland, this would be my local coffee shop of choice. Their coffee is on point and pastries come right out of the oven and onto your plate. Fresh as it gets!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem!   The most  wonderful croissants you can imagine, pastries to die for and wonderful sandwiches.  I only wish I lived closer but I stop in when I have an appointment at the Cole Eye Institute.   Immaculate resaurant and the owner is great.   Worth your time to go here."}
{"text":"Best croissants in Cleveland. And the kouign amann is amazing. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"imo, best croissant in the U.S, certainly at least on par with the best in NYC. Pour over coffee is very good, cappuccino is good (not great).  Kouign-Aman is also fantastic. Well worth the 40 minute round-trip drive from the flats. This is a must-visit when in Cleveland. easy parking behind shop."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today to try it with my roommates, and we were very openly excited. The girl at the counter taking our orders gave us a dirty look while we were taking pictures of the display and fawning over the pastries, even though we were the only ones in line. So service is just okay...

I got a ham and cheese croissant, and while the cheese was well-distributed throughout the interior, the ham was just a thick blob in the middle. The pastry itself was good, but I was disappointed by the ham blob. 

Their in-house chai is flavorful and light, on par with Algebra teahouse's chai. I ordered a kouign amann as well, which was sizable and tasty, but a little dry on the edges. The center part is delectable and perfectly balances salty and sweet. All in all, a good place to go to for pastries, just not served with a smile."}
{"text":"Great coffee - I had a cappuccino, which was way better than many of the supposed \"best\" places in town like Rising Star.  Much more like the kind of cappuccino you would get in a good coffee shop in Italy.  I didn't try the pastries and breads, but they looked delicious - especially the croissants - big, golden brown, and flaky!"}
{"text":"The best scones, danishes & croissants I've ever eaten.  The scones are crumbly yet very tender, and the date nut has the perfect amount of sweetness & fat-to-starch ratio.  This guy has some mad baking skills!!  The croissants were flaky, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth excellent.  My first time trying a Kouign Amann, and I'll get them every time!  It's like a croissant topped with creme brulee crust.  Excellent!  The lemon blueberry danish was incredible.  

Although we'd already had breakfast before stoppin in, I still wanted to try one of everything.  They have lots of savory choices, like ham/cheese croissants, broccoli/cheddar scones, and their take on an \"everything\" bagel, which is a croissant topped with the \"everything\" and filled with cream cheese.  I saw them warming a construction worker's ham/cheese croissant in the oven for his take-out order & thought that was a good idea, especially on a blustery & cold day.  Wonderful coffee too, and the knowledgeable owner is on-site.  The place was very clean & sunny inside.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm an avid visitor to the Cleveland clinic since my kidney transplant. Just found this local gem in the neighborhood. Vanilla Latte and chocolate chip homemade cookie. The bakery looks amazing. I wanted it all. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place has become quite the magnet for us as it's both walking distance from work and in the same building as the little guy's daycare. So we are practically forced - forced I tell you! - to get a pastry and latte from here every day. The espresso drinks and pour over coffees are always fantastic and you will not have a better pastry many places. 

Emily, the barista is always friendly and EXPERT at her craft. The honey latte is outstanding and the vanilla variety features a house-made vanilla bean syrup. Both are delicious - perfect for an afternoon treat. 

Speaking of treats - get over there and try a Kouign Amann. I don't know what the hell it is, but it is fantastic. Flaky, buttery, just a touch sweet and just a touch salty. A LOT delicious. 

The father/son team doing the baking and lunch-preparing are in constant motion; it's cool to watch them doing their thing. I've tried several different menu items for lunch and all have been extremely fresh and delicious. Small rotating menu of salads, sandwiches, and pizzas is just right for a bakery cafe. 

Next time you're in the area, stop in and get yourself a treat. You deserve it!"}
{"text":"I actually was going to give 4 stars originally but then my daughter found a bug on her sandwich. Unfortunately I had already eaten all of mine, which was delicious...just hope I didn't eat any bugs."}
{"text":"Went with my roommates for the first time today and was very excited to try out this new cafe right across from the Cleveland Clinic where we work. 

Customer Service:
Albeit, we were very cheerful walking in, chatting with each other about what to get and pointing at the food. No one else was behind us, so it wasn't like we were holding up a line. Maybe the cashier was having a bad day, but her face was piqued and she clearly wasn't too enthralled of our excited. 

Food:
I had a savory scone with cheese caramelized onions and a local honey latte. The scone was just what I needed to start my day--very tasty and filling, and surprising moist. The latte was delicious and full of flavor--a beautiful balance of espresso, milk, and sweetness from the honey.

Atmosphere: 
Very clean and bright, great for studying and getting some work done. It was fun to watch the chefs prepare the pastries as we ordered. Seats about 25 customers.

Overall, food was great and customer service could be improved. Will return again sometime, hopefully greeted by someone who looks like they want to work here."}
{"text":"Great barista and peaceful ambiance for a studious day! There's a parking lot in the back which makes it accessible. Everything's freshly made even the coffee beans and latte syrups!"}
{"text":"The pastries at Fluffy Duck are terrific. I've tried muffins, scones and other items and thought each was light and flavorful. It is a good location to stop into quickly and get a quick, good bite to eat. Next time, I definitely want to try lunch."}
{"text":"This place has a small but high quality selection of salads, soups, sandwiches, etc. I really enjoyed a ham baguette and my wife had a small salad that was really fresh. When she asked for some bread to eat with it they gave her two slices of really nice whole wheat and didn't charge for them. 

Looks like they had a decent crowd on the day I was there. They deserve it."}
{"text":"Gorgeous little cafe. 
I found the bright interior of Fluffy Duck to be very soothing and the smells coming from the bakery were mouth watering.  I recently stopped in on my way to the Cleveland Clinic across the street, FYI there is additional parking in the back of the building. Their cafe latte was fantastic, they use local whole milk and you can really taste the difference in the quality of beans.  You couldn't go wrong with any of the huge selection of fresh pastries but I specifically recommend the croissant, lemon blueberry scone and if they have them the kouign amann which was fantastic!
Make sure to stop in to grab a cup and don't forget something sweet to pair it with, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Good food and tasty breads but slowwwwwwwwwww service.
We were the only ones and food took forever :/ 
1 star for waiting too long ..."}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time and I will definitely go back.  Went at breakfast time, so I had an almond croissant - OH MY GOSH!  It was so good - one of the best I've ever had. And believe me - I know croissants!  The place was sparkling clean and the people were very friendly and welcoming.  There is even entertainment - watching the breads and pastries be made!

They also do lunch, so I will go back to try that, as well.  And there is parking out back, which makes it easy, since it is in a busy area."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a late lunch today and it was so delicious! My boyfriend and I had the spicy turkey and ham sandwiches. It just so happened that they had ran out of their sourdough bread, but the owner made different suggestions so that we would still have a delicious sandwich. It is a very chill atmosphere with lots of natural lighting. The employees appear to be quieter, but kind and knowledgeable.  The menu is small, but full of good options. I enjoyed my lunch very much!"}
{"text":"This is my third time coming to this cafe! This place is great to do some work with a nice music selection. I have tried the Kouign Amann, let me tell you it's bomb. 
Today, I tried the ham and cheese croissant. It was so delicious, they heated it up and it was amazzing. I recommend the herbal mango tea too! Service is always friendly. I really enjoy coming here for the quality ingredients and great service."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate less than one star. Just to put things in perspective, this is my very first bad review that I have ever written. That alone should help you gauge how upset I am. I decided to check out this new place as my new go-to spot for studying and weekend coffee. After paying over $4 for a cup of latte and again over $4 for a piece of croissant, I got kicked out for bringing outside food. I wouldn't ever be this upset if he just politely said \"I'm sorry but we don't allow outside food at this coffee shop\" because I understand that and I can of course respect that. But instead, the owner came out of the kitchen and said \"why don't you guys just go study at Penn Station then? This is a business\" in the most belittling tone. I'm sorry but did he not expect to find people studying at this coffee shop when he opened a coffee shop especially near Case/Cleveland Clinic campus?? And it's not like I just walked in with outside food and sat down to eat. Not just me, but my friend and I spent lots of $$ in that short period of time we were at this expensive place and were definitely thinking of ordering more if we stayed longer. Maybe he likes to keep his coffee shop people-free but I thought I was benefiting his business by studying there, because more people that pass by can see that there are people inside and will be more invited to come inside and check it out. I personally would be more likely to walk into a coffee shop that has people working/studying and hanging out than an empty one. I am sorry to say that this place definitely lost good chunk of business today as I will be telling all my other grad student friends to avoid this place as the owner is not friendly and anti-studying for sure."}
{"text":"So many bakeries in Cleveland, so little time! Let me just say that you should probably, definitely put Fluffy Duck on your short list; it's a cut above most of the other bakeries in Cleveland in terms of professional, high quality pastry. I've never quite recovered from the loss of beloved Bonbon Bakery and their other-worldly chocolate crossaints, and Fluffy Duck's aren't an exact dupe, they are pretty darn close. This and the kouign amann would be alone to keep me coming back. All that being said, I will admit that I visited this bakery twice, and both times there was a rather surly gentleman working at the front. Perhaps he wasn't surly, just somewhat nonfriendly, but regardless, my first visit this kind of put me off. Partly because I rarely visit coffee shops/bakeries unless I'm planning to stay a while and enjoy the atmosphere, but when the staff is not so friendly it definitely doesn't lend a welcoming vibe. Despite this, the interior is bright and spacious and there's that lovely aroma of butter and sugar when you enter. I should also mention the cafe choices, many of which are made in house (homemade syrups, homemade chai blend) but I did find the coffee to be a bit weak for my preference. I've also tried their pizza, which I found a bit lackluster personally, and I wouldn't order again. All in all, I really really enjoy the pastry at Fluffy Duck, and should their service improve, I'd definitely consider visiting more based on this alone."}
