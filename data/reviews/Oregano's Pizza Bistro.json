{"text":"Place is always packed for weekend dinners, harder to get in if there's more than a party for two.

Giant portions, love that there's enough to share or to munch on the followinh day.  

Cheese crisp and p'zookie are our motivation to come here, wish tables were not too close together, but I get it's part of their charm, plus that would mean less tables and then there  would be a longer wait ;)"}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly. Pizza could use more flavor IMO. Vino bambino salad is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE experience so far and we haven't even been sat down yet... Longest hour of my life so far!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is OK. The pizza is passable but not a million miles from a toasted lavash cracker, the beer is all right, and the pizza cookie is pretty good (it's basically a cookie half-baked in a deep-dish pizza pan). 

The problem with Oregano's is that it's something of a victim of its own success. They don't accept reservations no matter what the occasion, and there's almost always a wait. I've yet to figure out why, because it's really not all that. Unfortunately, I have friends who like it, and my polite requests to go elsewhere aren't always properly considered.

Oregano's relies on gimmicks--swing music, gigantic menus that are awkward to hold, and cutesy names for the pizzas. Sports fans take note: There is no cable TV.  When I  politely asked if they could turn on the Suns game (this was playoffs time, mind you), I was sternly told that Oregano's is not a sports bar. God forbid anything should distract customers from the frighteningly chirpy wait staff. 

So after waiting a good long while to be seated, expect to be led through a gauntlet of manufactured greetings and well-wishing on the way to your table. If you're particularly unlucky, you may be served by the effeminate robotic waiter who avoids eye contact--he manages to be chirpy and rude at the same time, the worst of both worlds. I think he's worked there for a long time. If you veer off script, his head just might explode.

I'm just too damn cranky for this overrated pizza joint, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience, my family and friends visiting from San Diego, stumbled over this place called OREGANO, wow great food, and lots of it, I had the Diablo shrimp recommended by Tony it was the bomb, enjoyed it and we ordered the cookie deep dish it was worth the wait it came with 3 scoops of ice cream great dessert to share, FYI order the cookie in advance because it takes 12 minutes. we definitely will come back when we visit Arizona again or hopefully they will export Oregano to San Diego"}
{"text":"Happy Saturday ! I've just found out what everyone else in the Valley already knew and that is Oreganos is an \"Awesome\" place to eat, let loose, and have a great time. You know that you've discovered something special when the place opened at 11:00 and there was a line to get in.. The atmosphere was great and I was greeted by Serena who not only had a great attitude but made suggestions as well and then I met Cassie who made the best Margarita and Sangria that I've ever had. You can tell when people enjoy what they do and Serena and Cassie along with tasty food are the reason that I'll be back with friends. Great News Travels Fast ! Keep up the great work ! West Bell Oregano's Rock !!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to eat. The lady scampi and the chicken Alfredo the dark is so good!!! The servers are very nice, accommodating, and very fast. If you are looking for a great Italian restaurant you gotta try this place!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Customer service ..food everything about this place is good had the stuffed pizza ..also for dessert i recomend the pizza cookie ..if you try it you will want to go back!"}
{"text":"best outdoor patio!  this is the best pizza I have ever had and my all time favorite.  everything is great- service, food, drinks and dessert! we tried all 3 pizza desserts and it was hard to chose a favorite, they were all delicious.

I strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Lunch salad was perfect. Jeska behind the bar was fun and really cool!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We did takeout so we cannot comment on the dining in.  The foot was hot when we got it.  The server offered us plates, utensils, parm cheese.  We got the baked pasta in the bread bowl. We split it and it was enough food.  Medium price range, worth it."}
{"text":"We went here after picking the mother in law up from the airport and we were all so happy with the choice!
30 minute wait so we sat at the bar for beers and garlic bread for my 5 year old. The place was so alive time flew and we were seated. The server was great and fast with drinks and orders. She also brought my daughter pizza dough to play with which kept her occupied the whole time!
Food was amazing!
Apps: wings and toasted ravioli
Dinner: deep dish pie with pepperoni sausage onions peppers! So wonderful only had room for a slice each but so glad to have the rest of it tonight!
Lasagna was also great and plenty left over also
I wish we would've been able to try the cookie but we were all going to roll out of there as it was....next time! 
Final bill was only $59!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is a great place for affordable, tasty Italian food with a twist.  I started out with garlic cheese bread (3 words I cannot shy away from) - this was huge and insane!  Gooey cheesiness on garlicky buttery bread.  I had to stop myself from eating this with the pizza about to arrive.  Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola Sausage Pan PIzza - an amazing combination of Chicago sausage crumbles, pepperoncinis, and gorgonzola cheese.  The pan crust was awesome.  I normally stay away from pan/Chicago-style crusts because I find them too buttery tasting, like you don't know if you're eating pizza or a dutch apple pie.  Oregano's pan crust was flaky, savory, and a perfect canvas for the toppings.

Service was friendly and on point.  Space inside is a little cramped, but tolerable.

I can't wait to try out Oregano's pasta dishes."}
{"text":"When I take a trip to PHOENIX 100 percent of the time Oregano's is on my list. 

Today I went to my go-to special angel hair pasta with 2 meatballs. All you can eat for $10! 

Ask for BRI she was on the patio and was very knowledgeable about the menu! 94 degrees with misters in the background! 

It's definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant for the price. You will eat till your pants buttons burst and till you sweat garlic! Pizookie craze is done justice by Oregano's"}
{"text":"Great News....  Oregano's  reached out to me and apologized for the terrible service and encouraged me to try the Mesa location once more.   

I decided to try again  yesterday for dinner and what a difference.  People were friendly, engaging and overall our party was very happy with the service.  They seemed to really care that we chose to come into their restaurant.   I am changing my previous 2 stars to 5. It was really that much better!   Way to go! I am a fan again! 


Below is my previous post 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the 2nd time I have been to this location where the service was not good.    I know they can do better and the training is better than this, since I used to work for Oregano's.   

The first time was a month or so ago, but I chalked that up to the place just having a bad night.  I know they happen.  I went back again a few days ago with some friends but  the service was just the same; slow,  kinda rude, and un-attentive. 

The experience started when we showed up with a 25 min wait on a Friday night (which i know is common), no big deal. We got some drinks at the bar, and sat in the waiting area.  Then I decided I would grab an appetizer for our group. I walked up to the hostess/togo counter to order and pay for it and the to-go girl started to ring me up with no problems. Awesome...right??  NO, the manager  (I know she was the manager, because she was wearing black) stopped her mid transaction and asked me to step to the other side of the counter to order with an actual server.  My thoughts.... OK fine, whatever. The problem was the tone and that she said \"no she can't help you, she has to help you over there\" and pointed to an actual server on the other side of the counter.  So I walked and had to wait until she was done putting in another order, after a  few min she was able to help me.  I get it, they are busy, but what was wrong with the to-go counter taking an order?  Especially since there was no wait and she was not on the phone.  That was off-putting.  I say this because I know better, I know Oregano's trains better than this. 

Moving on to dinner.  Since we already had drinks from the bar, I guess your server decided we didn't need any  refills the rest of the night, even after waiting 45 min to get our food.   We didn't order anything that takes a while (2 pasta dishes and a sausage sandwich), the kitchen was not slammed, since it was 9pm with several empty tables. Basically I had no drink for my dinner. We saw our server a total of 3 times.  Once to take our order, 50 min later to see how the food was, and last to drop the check. 

As we were leaving the manager was giving a half-assed apology to another table for the abnormal amount of time things took, and honestly we were there MUCH longer than them. 

The disappointing part is that I love Oregano's and I talk it up all the time. But this was a real let down."}
{"text":"Went to Oreganos last night about 5:00 pm. We only waited for about 5 minutes before were seated. I had their artichoke lasagna, it was so good! Our waitress Robin was amazing she took time to stay and chat with us about homeschooling and talking to her was like talking to an old friend! Absolutely wonderful experience at Oreganos!"}
{"text":"Finally, after a couple years of raving reviews from friends about Oregano's, we decided to try it. I've been told there's always a \"wait\" for a table and it's quite obvious why. EVERYTHING about this place was true!!! The food, price, service, atmosphere, friendliness from opening the door to go in until walking out was genuine. Not one snotty employee (there's usually at least one in every place we go) 
Our favorite part of our experience  (besides the GREAT food) was our server Alyssa R. So friendly, knowledgeable, and silly with us, but we also noticed how she turned on Miss Professional for a different table. From my opinion as a server at a luxury upscale resort, she's got it all. 
This will be our spot until we try all of the menu options!"}
{"text":"This Oregano,s is a giant rip-off. The prices are higher and the portions are smaller than the other Oregano's in Phoenix, Tempe and even Flagstaff. Make the drive to Phoenix so you won't get screwed."}
{"text":"I just moved to AZ and I've eaten at Oregano's three times!  The Caesar salad is amazing. Shared with sister and brother-in-law. We all loved it. Tonight our waiter was Charley. He was fun and attentive. I was so full after shared salad that I had no room for artichoke lasagna. (Charley fed me one bite just to make sure I tasted!) what a hoot! And of course the lasagna and the calzone were yummy. The flavors in the thin crust Pesto pizza we had on a previous visit was also delicious (but maybe could have been cooked a bit longer)

August 11 - I just have to say it again!  I love this place. I popped in around 2:00 for another one of those fabulous Grey Hounds made by Carrie the bar tender. OK, I had 2; but it was hard to stop there. Carrie is great!  She's an employee that Oregano is lucky to have. So thankful I live within a few blocks so I can stop in regularly for a quick drink, great service, fun conversation and perfect atmosphere!"}
{"text":"another first for me, and i will return.  ordered the medium thin crust bistro classic (white sauce), which is brushed with garlic butter, topped with roma tomatoes, diced red onion, thinly sliced basil, and four Italian cheeses...and!  i requested their homemade sausage as additional topping. also ordered their wings of fire @medium heat - they said their hot was really hot, so i thought to start off easy -  which i think next time i'll do their hot heat since their medium felt more like mild.  overall, wings were okay.  pizza had really good flavor, although the thin crust was cooked slightly to the dry and very crunchy side, but the juicy roma tomato toppings helped to balance it all out, fortunately.  btw their medium size pizza serves 3-4, cut in squares vs. slices, and it's a generous 16\" creation.  i felt the menu was somewhat pricey.  i'm big on value, so it's too bad oregano's isn't currently participating in the yelp deals discounts as i might otherwise visit more often. have read some of the other yelpers' reviews and on my next visit sometime in the next several months will try the pan pizza since it got great reviews."}
{"text":"My review is based on just a couple of Chicago style stuffed Pizzas.
There's a 45-minute wait time & the pizzas you get feel like stuffed with cheese, cheese & more cheese. 
We could hardly have one slice each.
Some of the other dishes like thin crust pizza, pasta are good though."}
{"text":"I picked up a couple of pies for a kickback and it was good.  I struggle to find good Pizza and good Chinese in Phoenix but this is pretty good.  We also picked up a Caesar salad which was sub-par."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad dish here yet. Great food and good service. I've been to 2 different locations now, and both had good service."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great staff. Wait time was way longer than they told us it would be."}
{"text":"Went to Oreganos for dinner on a Saturday night. There was a hour and a half wait, but that's to be expected considering how amazing this place is...at lease usually.   We took our seats and were instantly greeted by the waiter, who took our drink order. We ordered our appetizers and then were asked 3 times in a 5 min period if  we were ready to order. I understand they are busy but I waited my turn patiently, I'm not going to be rushed to eat.  We told him we wanted to wait to order.  When our apps came out, again we were asked to order so we did with reservation.  We had only taken a fee bites when our meal was served.  I do appreciate prompt service but I didn't want to eat in a rush and explained that to our server.   I could have dealt with this as he was just trying to do his job effectively.   
(This isn't the 1st time we have been rushed. One time we ordered a deep dish pizza. They explained that it takes 45 minutes. We knew this and said it was completely fine.  The server became annoyed and walked away.  STOP RUSHING PEOPLE!!!)
The worst part & the reason for the poor review was on the part of management.  There were 2 large parties seated near us (party of 2).  They were extremely loud and obnoxious!  But hey, again they have a right to enjoy their meal and socialize too. It was so loud we had to yell to communicate and we were sitting right across from one another.  We asked the hostess if the manager could just ask them to lower their voices just a bit...not only did the manager refuse, but he/she wouldn't even come speak with us. That's unacceptable!!!  They offered too move us, but we were being force fed by our waiter. (I kid). Either way I've learned my lesson.  I'll drive a little further if I need my Oreganos fix. At least at other locations you can enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Sure, it's already known this a great pizza joint offering thin crust culinary delights but what I want to share in this review is their wings.  Whoa!  Definitely worth ordering on every visit.  Crunchy, tangy and slightly sweet - winning combination.   I may begin just going for the wings.  :)"}
{"text":"Visited this incredible restaurant and cannot say enough - great food, great service, great atmosphere.

I almost passed because of the wait, but the wait was worth it.  I now also pick up the takeout which with the portion size, I have two great meals."}
{"text":"We love to come to Oregano's on Friday evenings.  We always sit at the bar and are always so excited to have Courtney take care of us.  She is attentive, friendly, and knows exactly what we like.  In short, she's fabulous and makes everyone feel welcome."}
{"text":"We went to dinner on Saturday night and had a 35 minute wait. Not bad for Oregano's. 

The Good: 
Roasted Garlic Chicken Lasagna - 5 Stars. Freaking phenomenal. I personally don't care for lasagna, but tried it after my husband started moaning over it. The best lasagna I've ever tried... I'll be getting this next time. 

The Antipasto Thing - 5 Stars. Delicious. The Jr size is more than enough for two people to share. 

Old-Fashioned Sangria - 4 Stars. Very tasty... 

The Service - 5 Stars. Excellent... Jordan was a fabulous server. See more below on service. 

The Bad: 
Mardi Gras Chicken Melt - 1 Star. Nowhere in the description of this sandwich does it say that the chicken will be cold (not cool, COLD). When everything is steaming hot, the texture of cold chicken is unappealing and borderline inedible. I ate less than 1/4 of this sandwich before giving up. Plus, the description states it is \"cajun\" chicken. The chicken literally tasted like it had come out of a can - no flavoring.

Jordan (awesome server) asked if I wanted it boxed and I said no, thanks. I wasn't going to say anything, but she pressed and I gave in. She spoke with her manager and offered to bring me something else for dinner. I told her it was ok, I didn't need anything else. She insisted so I ended up taking a Veggie Wedgie home. 

I would have given this visit four stars, but Jordan going above and beyond bumped the experience up to five stars. 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I get a craving to come here about every other week.  Their food is consistently fantastic, even with their large, diverse menu.  The pizzas are fresh and unusual (Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato ... potatoes?  On PIZZA?  Who would have guessed that would be so fantastic?).  The pasta is full of garlic and flavor.  The wings are crispy and perfect.  The sandwiches are huge and tasty.  I could go on.  I've never had anything there that wasn't terrific!

Now, since the food is so good and the atmosphere so fun, and since everyone KNOWS that (due to reviews like the one you're reading now), be prepared to wait.  If you get there around 7:00 any given night, you should be prepared to wait about a half hour.  If you arrive at the same time on a weekend night, your wait could be over an hour.  Parking at the Tempe and Old Town Scottsdale locations is tight (as the Phoenix area tries to grow up and become a real city, this is inevitable, and will be more and more common), but it's better at the Mesa and Gilbert spots.  And since the food is fresh, you naturally have to wait longer for food that takes longer to prepare, such as the wings or the deep dish pizzas.

Okay, you've been warned.  Believe me (and I'm one of Earth's least patient people), the wait will be worth it."}
{"text":"I have always heard good things about Oregano's since I moved out to Arizona.  My husband and I finally decided to try this place for a late lunch last week.  The place was cute, but that's probably the only positive thing I could say about this place.  We got there at an off time, about 2:30.  I ordered a slice of pizza and my husband ordered some chicken wings.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Did I mention the restaurant was pretty much empty, there were 2 or three tables besides us?  Waited some more.  Waitress never did come to give us updates on the food or why it was taking so long.  Waiting still. Waitresses are hiding, can't even flag one down to ask what is going on, but I hear them giggling nearby.   30 minutes later we finally get our food.  Normally I don't mind waiting if it's really busy or I am ordering a big meal.  Thirty minutes for a SLICE of pizza and some wings were a little excessive, especially since we were practically the only ones there.  As soon as we got our food we put in an order for the pizza cookie because I have always heard good things about it and I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for it.  Now for the pizza, that was probably the worst pizza I have ever had.   I wouldn't even call it pizza.  It was just some melted cheese on a burnt cracker.   The crust was literally black on the bottom.  My husband's wings were a little overdone, but the sauce was okay.   The pizza cookie thing looked better than it tasted, it was undercooked in the middle.  I don't know if this was an off day for them or what, but the service was very slow, and the food wasn't that great.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The first time we tried this place, it was Saturday night and a 90 minute wait.  Declining to wait, we returned on a Wednesday night and sat outside, which was pleasant enough.  We were really looking forward to this based on Yelp reviews, but were all disappointed.   The tomato sauce had a very strong sage/thyme/oregano flavor that overrode the meager toppings.  The cheese was definitively not Italian - cheddar/mozzarella mix with very little flavor.  We also ordered the \"Favorite Oregano Salad\" which was another disappointment as  the raisins overwhelmed the subtleness of the feta and kalamata  olives.   We will not be back.  Can someone please tell me where to get a good Italian pizza in Scottsdale?"}
{"text":"Very sad to write this , I have been to this location several times and look forward to the All Kale Ceasar salad with chicken. Took my mother and husband to dinner tonight, our regular Monday tradition. Tonight was the absolute worse service I have ever had. Our waitress didn't seem to really care about serving us, from the get go she seemed very distracted, even though she told us they were slow at the time. I ordered my salad with chicken and when it came out it was missing the chicken, I let the waitress who brought out our food that it was missing she said she would take care of it, after waiting a good 5 minutest I asked if our waitress could come to the table, she told me it would be coming soon. I ordered another glass of wine while I wait and it literally showed up 20 minutes later when everyone else was finishing up their dinner. My chicken showed up in a bowl, the salad was lacking dressing. Needless to say my absolute favorite salad has been ruined, along with one of my favorite places to eat. Won't be going back or recommending for a very long time."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend go to this place almost weekly now! Great food, great service and huge portions! Our favorite server is kacee. Me and my boyfriend both work in the restaurant industry and have never returned to any restaurant as much as we do Oreganos. The only complaint we've ever had was the long waits this place gets because it's so packed. Please open another location in north Peoria!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I had dinner here during our Son's ASU move-in weekend this past weekend. It was absolutely FANTASTIC! We arrived to an open table for 2 in the bar area (no wait at all). We started by having a really tall dark local beer which was very good. We then split the Mrs. Gibbilini's Original Spinach Salad and between the both of us couldn't finish it for fear we wouldn't be able to eat the small (8\") Pepperoni, Onion, and Roasted Red Pepper deep dish pizza that we ordered (brought home 2 slices). The spinach salad was outstanding and the Chicago style deep dish pizza was the best that I have ever had outside of Chicago! Props to our server as well as she took great care of us...and was funny and entertaining (not to mention, she was really cute too! Our Son missed out...haha). We will definitely be going back on each visit to Tempe to see our Son!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and this restaurant was recommended to me. The food is good as is the service. Personable wait staff. Cool retro decor. Only knock - it's too loud inside!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious, but the service is subpar. Visited this location for lunch and both the hostess and male manager were rude and dismissive. The server was sweet, but forgetful. Overall, this place could easily be a five star joint if the service was improved."}
{"text":"I hated it. We ate there before going to Gammage to see a play and we were seated in a strange addition in the back corner.  I noticed a smell, like rotting food, but it was faint and I ignored it. The food was not great. I think the smell was bothering me and ruining my appetite. The cheesy bread had too much garlic and too much cheese, if that's possible. My husband didn't notice that grease was dripping down his face while eating it. That's too much. 

Then, a COCKROACH crawled by on the wall right by our table, at eye level. We were horrified. We called the manager over and informed him, and he apologized and told us it had NEVER happened before, which I find hard to believe since roaches don't exactly lead solitary lives, and said he would \"do something\" to make it up to us. 

He didn't.  Not that it would have really mattered (I won't be back), but if you are manager and you tell a customer you will do something , well then you do it."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. You get an hour wait on weekdays. Great place to go for casual Italian food. Their pizzas are very unique. Atmosphere is great for Italian. I've enjoyed it the 2 out 3 times."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the worst experience in this restaurant. We arrive at 2:55 pm, my husband, my two toddlers girls and I. The restaurant it wasn't busy, when the server took our drink order, we order a wings of fire and the fancy dancy pizza. The wings arrived at 3:35!! And the pizza 10 minutes later!! The server said that this pizza took so longer to cook, but the pizza was a mess, it was burned, the bread was like a salty cracker and the cheese looked like microwave heated. My husband told me that we should leave the place, but my girls were so hungry. The manager went to our table and said sorry for the crispy pizza and she paid for the pizza. I heard another families making complains. We used to go to the Shea location and always was perfect."}
{"text":"We have loved Oregano's in Scottsdale and Tempe.  Took friends to Gilbert and it took 65 minutes to be seated although we were told 15 to 25 min.  When two tables sat empty I bothered the girl at the door who had her arms around the neck of one of the guy servers and she said she hadn't forgotten.  10 min later when the third table sat empty my guy friend went to get action.  We were seated, ordered and waited 25 minutes for food - not bad, but when we finished, dishes were cleared and we declined dessert we waited another 25 minutes for our check and only got it when we said if we didn't get in within 5 min we were walking out.  We'll never go again.  Many of the staff just played around with each other while a few worked very hard.  We got the players!!"}
{"text":"This was my very first time at Oregano's and we were very pleased! Our wait time was fast, but that could change depending on the time you go. We had a wonderful server and notice great service all around us! This is the mark of a good restaurant to me and will always draw us back. The decor and atmosphere is adorable and feels like you're in the old neighnborhood at a mom & pop type of place. So darn cute!

We split the Kaboom Dip  ( enough for 4 people) and my husband had some local brew. I am pregnant, so I am currently not drinking :( But I want to come back and try some of their cocktails, the drinks menu looked fun!  I ordered the Alfredo of the Dark with chicken and my husband ordered the Big Meatball sandwich. The portions are HUGE and you will take home leftovers, in fact I encourage you to do so. 

We wish so bad that we had room for dessert, but we want to come back so we can enjoy it fully.

Please visit this little place... you won't be sad you did!"}
{"text":"Our server was on top of it, the food was good, and I liked the old timey ambiance of 40's music and black and white movies.  However, we waited an hour for our food with a 9 month pregnant woman and a toddler in our group and battled fruit flies from start to finish.  This would have been 5 stars without the wait and the flies."}
{"text":"Love OReganos already, just love it a little more now after I opened my to go order and found some generous sides of cheese and red child flakes! None of those little packets that have barely anything in them..."}
{"text":"Ya know what? There is nothing wrong here! What a meal. Denise was great fun and the stuffed rigatoni was delicious. Add some sausage and you have a great meal without the 45 minute wait for pizza.  
We'll be back."}
{"text":"Stuffed pizza is just awesome. I really enjoy the super thin crust also.
The wait staff are always pleasant and upbeat. 
The place is always busy and sometimes the wait can be a little long 
My real complaint is the bar just sucks. No good alcohol in stock. Typical well booze with no imagination. This is not the area for cheap crap.
Probably will be the downfall of the place in the long run"}
{"text":"If you like pizza that taste like it has a cardboard crust than this is the place for you"}
{"text":"I stopped by their Tempe location for lunch yesterday, and this place fills up quick.  I can understand why.

I really like the Chicago influenced ambiance.  The staff were great as well.

I ordered the orgenanos favorite salad, and its regular size is huge.  The salad itself was very good, but couldn't come close to finishing it due to its sheer size.  

It's a pretty neat place, and I would go back."}
{"text":"Ordered our pizza over the phone at 645, and told it would be ready by 740 (an hour... ok, they are busy. I get it). We arrive at 710 and head to the bar for a drink while we wait. At 745 we check in on the pizza and are informed that it'll be \"just a second\". We sit down at the stools directly in front of the to go counter. Waiting.... waiting.... um.. hello. 825..... we ask again.... they scrambled to find our ticket and we discover that our pizza had been sitting in their warmer for over half an hour. They barely offered more than a \"oh I'm sorry\". Our pizza is soft, not crispy. At least it was still warm, one was straight cold... it was very disappointing and I can't believe they wouldn't comp it or offer anything at all. The bellinis were delicious as always and the hosts were lovely and friendly."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here on our last day in Arizona, and we ended up staying for about 3 hours! Sitting outside under the stars waiting for our pizza was amazing. The pizza took a little while to cook, but we ordered caesar salad and quite a few beers while we waited! The deep dish pizza is ridiculously good, but my favorite part of the meal was the cookie pizza! I ate so much food that I needed to unbutton my pants afterward, but it was so worth it! Great food, and an overall fabulous time. This is a place that everyone should try!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicgaoland and have to say this deep dish was great ! Service has been excellent as well! Will be back this week for dinner as well. We love pizza and this will be at the top of our pizza experience. Our server Tim was excellent , best service I've had in awhile !"}
{"text":"I get a craving to come here about every other week.  Their food is consistently fantastic, even with their large, diverse menu.  The pizzas are fresh and unusual (Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato ... potatoes?  On PIZZA?  Who would have guessed that would be so fantastic?).  The pasta is full of garlic and flavor.  The wings are crispy and perfect.  The sandwiches are huge and tasty.  I could go on.  I've never had anything there that wasn't terrific!

Now, since the food is so good and the atmosphere so fun, and since everyone KNOWS that (due to reviews like the one you're reading now), be prepared to wait.  If you get there around 7:00 any given night, you should be prepared to wait about a half hour.  If you arrive at the same time on a weekend night, your wait could be over an hour.  Parking at the Tempe and Old Town Scottsdale locations is tight (as the Phoenix area tries to grow up and become a real city, this is inevitable, and will be more and more common), but it's better at the Mesa and Gilbert spots.  And since the food is fresh, you naturally have to wait longer for food that takes longer to prepare, such as the wings or the deep dish pizzas.

{"text":"I get a craving to come here about every other week.  Their food is consistently fantastic, even with their large, diverse menu.  The pizzas are fresh and unusual (Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato ... potatoes?  On PIZZA?  Who would have guessed that would be so fantastic?).  The pasta is full of garlic and flavor.  The wings are crispy and perfect.  The sandwiches are huge and tasty.  I could go on.  I've never had anything there that wasn't terrific!

Now, since the food is so good and the atmosphere so fun, and since everyone KNOWS that (due to reviews like the one you're reading now), be prepared to wait.  If you get there around 7:00 any given night, you should be prepared to wait about a half hour.  If you arrive at the same time on a weekend night, your wait could be over an hour.

{"text":"My friends and I came here for dinner after watching a during spring training game between the Reds and the Giants.  The moment  I saw this place, I had a feeling that this place was going to be good.  This place was busy and while waiting, we were directed to the bar area.  Watching other patrons eating their pizza made me salivate; however, there is one problem for me: Lent.  I sacrificed red meat-beef, pork, lamb, etc.  I'm hungry now just thinking about their delicious pizza. I just have to experience vicariously through my friends.

My friends ordered a large thin crust pizza and the raved it so much and they were rubbing it in my face.  They said the crust is fabulous! They liked folding it over to eat \"new york style.\"   I ordered the chicken lasagne and it was awesome.  My only problem that it gets cold fast.  I also loved the garlic cheesy bread.  My wife and I shared a large salad , which was plentiful. I would have preferred trying the other salads. 

The staff was pleasant and friendly . The outdoor dining area is great, especially during the evening under the Arizona sky. 

We will DEFINITELY be back here on our next trip to Scottsdale! I can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, poor service. We waited over an hour for our food and no one seemed to care. (On a Monday night)"}
{"text":"We have been to several of the Oregano's in AZ. Overall had a great experience and exactly what we have come to expect. Server was attentive and super friendly. Food came out fast and everything was exactly as ordered. Love their outdoor patio because it's covered. This might be my new favorite location!"}
{"text":"Tried to call in a to-go order around five, was told I couldn't do a to-go order till at least eight thirty. A little disappointing for how much I love this place, and how excited I was for it to be so close to my house. If I can't order a pizza for pickup when I'm wanting dinner, what's the point in doing take-out?"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back here. The pizza was not out of this world. It took forever to get served and the server was late with everything extra that we asked for. The cheese bread was commercial and could have been made better at home with real cheese. 

The Caesar salad lacked enough dressing but was good once we asked for more. 

I heard the deep dish pizza is amazing but we didn't want to wait 1 hour and ten minutes for that since we were starving."}
{"text":"It's hard to be oregano's Pizza anywhere! We picked up our pizza at the W. Elliot Rd. location in Tempe Arizona. Our order came exactly as placed, and it was on time. The best part, is that it was served hot in all ingredients were on the pizza as we ordered it. We prefer thin crust, which can be hard to get  at mini pizza joints. However, oregano's gpizza is the bomb Diggity! We will definitely continue to call oregano's each time we get a hankering for"}
{"text":"I rated it as good as it gets but I hate the long waits. I endure them because I love the food that much. I think part of the Oregano's philosophy is keep it small, keep demand, make some hype. I think this philosophy sucks. Just get bigger restaurants so more people can eat good food in a timely fashion. PLEASE!

Pizza, amazing. Great sandwiches. Great pasta. Great salads. Great specialty drinks. Great service. Great dessert. Great. This place can win over anyone, once you get in."}
{"text":"Serious....
SP Fries....
Wings
really, this place rocks"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan or Oregano's in the past - only eaten there a couple times in the last 10 years.  However, I was willing to try it again since it opened up near our hood.  They have changed the menu since the last time I was there.  For the better, that is.  We ended up stopping by the first week they were open and wow was it absolutely NUTS!  I ordered a deep dish (being from Chicago and seeing it's a hard time to find good deep dish in Arizona, had to try).  It was undercooked but edible.  Sometimes you can't judge on first impressions, especially since the restaurant just opened, so I went back the next week with a friend.  I order the deep dish again and it was awesome!  The crust was cooked to perfection with the perfect amount of seasoning.  

We have been back numerous times since the first week.  The staff is very friendly and most are down-to-earth.  We have met bartenders Robin and Brooke - both incredible bartenders with incredible customer service and a senses of humor.  We have also met a couple servers, Shawn and Jill.  They were attentive, quick, polite, funny and made our experience worth coming back and asking to sit in their section.  We end up sitting at the bar most of the time though since there always seems to be seats there without a wait.

We have ordered takeout quite a bit (slice & salad).  It's a 50/50 chance whether they get the salad right for takeout though.  We've never had any problems with the food when we go in for lunch or dinner - only takeout.  

The reason for 4 rather than 5 stars:
1.  The 50/50 chance of food being wrong or not cooked properly.
2.  The staff is GREAT!!  (other than that one time we sat for 17 minutes while the bartender hit on a girl on the other side of the bar.  Brooke came to our rescue)
3.  The front house receptionists don't always seem to work together and there's sometimes confusion about tables, etc and they are obnoxiously friendly, at times. :-)

Overall, they are a great neighborhood pizzeria and worth checking out.  Wish they delivered..."}
{"text":"Went in with family and told the waitress that we didn't want to hurry her, but unfortunately we had to leave in about 45 min. Our waitresses name was Megan and she was amazing! Right away took our order, with a smile on her face, and constantly checked in with us to make sure we were comfortable and not worried about our timing. She delivered our food right when it came out of the oven, and brought us boxes, and our check without even needing to ask. Amazing establishment, great for a family night."}
{"text":"They left some pasta in my sister's menu and she flipped out. Great dinner and a show. Man what a place to be! Love the staff as well."}
{"text":"Came here last Thurs. as we arrived for IMAZ. We had salad, pizza, wine, beer. Yummy! Four stars! We like it so much that we went back a week later, our last night in Tempe......the food was still good! The tall blonde bimbo server was another story. My daughter was a server so I am usually very nice and always tip 20%. We were seated, hardly got to open the menu and she asked if we were ready to order....no bimbo, we have not even looked yet!  We ordered drinks, they took quite sometime to come. We ordered, the food came fairly quickly . Then, Bimbo asked my husband if he wanted another beer, he politely says, yes. About 10 minutes passes, no beer, by then my wine was gone. We finally got her attention after about 20minutes to order my 2nd glass do wine and remind Miss Smarty Shorts that hubby was still waiting on a beer! Ugh! Need I say more....oh yeah, 15% tip, only because my hubby is a nice guy! Careful folks!"}
{"text":"I typically love Oregano's, but I like the one my fiancé and I go to in Tucson. This one did not impress me at all. 
Our waiter was a little too pushy when it came to adding things onto our meal for an extra charge... We both ordered the Pasta Basta and I didn't want any meat on mine (I have a mainly vegetarian diet). After pushing me to order some meat, he made a snarky comment about me not eating any protein. 

Also, there was a waitress there who was serving the table next to us. She was wearing extremely short shorts, to the point where I lost my appetite. Is there no dress code for the employees here?

Overall, the food was good. First time trying the garlic bread and we ordered it with cheese... It was fantastic!"}
{"text":"New in town to catch a few Spring Training games (go Angels!), I did some research ahead of time to find some good places to eat.  Oregano's was getting glowing reviews in several places, so we decided to give them a try.  Great choice!  A funky local place with a good vibe & so much personality!  Their backstory is on the menu & is worth the read.  We were starving & there was a pretty long wait, so we just grabbed 2 seats at the outdoor bar to eat there instead of waiting 45 min. for a table.  Our servers couldn't have been nicer (or cuter, says the husband), and sitting at the bar gave us a chance to visit with them more than if we had been at a table.  Plus, we got to watch old reruns on grainy black & white TV's while we listened to old rat-pack music.  Loved that!

The menu was huge, but we settled on the Aunt Margherita Pizza, add pepperoni.  Not very adventurous, I know, but we were starving & didn't want to chance any bad surprises.  A stuffed or pan pizza would have been more fun but, again, STARVING & didn't want to wait.  Did I mention we were starving??  Anyway, our pizza came out on a super thin, crispy crust and oh-so-yummy.  Although it did seem a little bit dry, so we asked for more sauce; but other than that, delicious.  And not too bread-y, like some pizza can be. 

While we were waiting for our food to come out, they came around with samples of another thin crust pizza, Lawrence's Original, I think it was.  There was much more going on with that than the one we ordered.  Lawrence's is the one we'll order next time.  Either that or not arrive so hungry, so we can stand the wait for a stuffed or pan pizza 'cause they looked AWESOME!  (Also, note to self: carnivores should not take menu suggestions from vegetarian servers.)  Wish we had room for a pizzookie for dessert.  Next time..... (and there WILL be a next time).

I think Oregano's would be a better experience with a bigger group -- even just a party of 4 or more.  That way you could try a few different things & work your way thru their extensive menu.  But this was an overall fun experience & well worth the effort!!"}
{"text":"Oh Yeah!!! Oregano's is great. The Pizza is the best and thin crust is always a good choice. Their pastas are good too. If you are there on a weekend night, be prepared to wait. It fills up quick."}
{"text":"Their meatball sub is unlike any other. Their pizza is pretty good too. The salads I've gotten haven't impressed me, though. The pasta I got was yummy but a small portion that I didn't expect. You just have to know what to order there."}
{"text":"Best place we had lunch and service in a long time. Keep up the Great work Patrick   
                                       Thanks"}
{"text":"This place has decent food. The sevice is slow and staff is often pleasantly confused. If you don't mind waiting this is a good spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Food is great, however it doesn't matter what time of day you come there is always a wait of 45 min to a hour long. ALWAYS! My husband and I left and drove to the one in Mesa and within 5 min were seated. (We had already waited 10 min before we decided to leave.)I'd reconsider which Oreganos you go to unless you don't mind waiting a hour to be sat."}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant in town that I've had to wait for a table.  That's not a bad thing, just an observation.

A note on the food... I'd go with pizza over pasta here.  I've had both, but prefer the pizza.  Pizza comes in thin, stuffed, or thick (pan) crust.  However, if you want a LOT of pasta, order that because you won't be disappointed with the vast quantity of food that you get.  Try to save room for dessert.  The \"original pizza cookie\" is just like a pazookie from BJ's, but possibly bigger.

A note on the service... If you order a dish that has a long prep time, they are good about letting you know ahead of time so that you're not wondering where your food is 45 minutes later."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to this location and the experiences were very different. 

First of all the service was awful.   I should have walked out and regret not doing it.   My wife and I started with the simple dinner salad.   It was a very large portion but 99% lettuce.   I will say the home made croutons were awesome but nothing else.   We waited over 5 minutes for dressing that we asked 2 different servers for. 

I ordered the chicken lasagna.   No nice way to say it,  it SUCKED.  Very bland and burnt.   Maybe some of the food here is good but this isn't.   My wife ordered a margarita pizza.   Not good either but wouldn't go so far as to say it sucked.

I was very disappointed with this restaurant and will not be back,  ever.   I would say do not waste your money here.  Some reviews seem good so maybe we caught them on the wrong day? ? Or ordered the worst stuff on the menu?   Either way with so many good restaurant's over here I would skip this place."}
{"text":"I am writing this review with nothing in my stomach in disappointment in my heart. I work nights so usually take my one hour lunch break about 9 P.M. and I decided to try the Oregano's near my work for the first time. Since it was my first time going to Oregano's I had high hopes because of all the wonderful reviews from my friends that were accompanying me. We arrived around 9:15 and were seated quickly and immediately received our drinks. After we ordered the \"Boom\" dip which turned out decent enough, we ordered the Pablo Picasso salad, The Lady is a scamp, and the Pesto Penne Bowl at around 9:30. After about 20 minutes of waiting and only one drink refill we started noticing the waitress doing her closing duties. About 40 minutes after putting in our order we still hadn't received our food and were constantly checking the time wondering if we would have enough time to eat or if we would just need to get it to go. At about 10:10 we still hadn't received our food or assurance it was coming out soon. We quickly decided to pay for appetizer and head back to work. After walking around searching for our inattentive waitress I quickly paid the bill and left."}
{"text":"Oregano's is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe! The food is delicious - I've never been disappointed by a single appetizer, entrée or desert! And since they've recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day. Bonus: The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly. Just a really great place to dine!"}
{"text":"The pasta and salad dishes are packed with flavor and huge portions.  The pizza cookie is a delicious dessert as well.  It's one of the go to places when hungry for pasta"}
{"text":"The pizza is good.  The pizookie dessert is delicious.  But, I give big dings for the long wait for food (usually after sustaining a pretty long wait just to get a table) and the fact that they refuse to take reservations for large parties making it an absolute nightmare of a wait for a large group to eat there.  For that reason alone, I can't go back."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. We waited for over an hour to be seated, then waited another 20 minutes to order. Then waited another 40 minutes for our order to served. Now hungry and impatient we were finally served and our order was wrong and we received a free pizza. In the end the pizza was decent but I would not return if I had  choice."}
{"text":"Oreganos is amazing no matter which location you visit, but this one is the crème de la crème. The staff are so fantastic they could serve liver and onions and I would still come as much as I do, which is embarrassingly often. On one of my first times eating here, we left and our waiter chased us out with my son's bottle that was left on the table. We thanked him, got in the car and started to drive away, and he came running up with my son's backpack. We thanked him (again) and parked to make sure we hadn't absentmindedly left anything else. We got back in the car and got ready to turn onto the road, and there he was again with our debit card. Needless to say we were super surprised with the amazing service despite our extreme forgetfulness. They have continued time and time again to provide a great experience. And I haven't even started on the food!!!! Delicious! Make sure you get dessert!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Oregano's. The good pizza, but not the best! Maybe I should try something different next time."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time and there was a 45 minute wait on a Thursday night. It was a very loud atmosphere when we got in, but the service was very good for how many people were there. It was quiet around 8ish-9 though. Our server was a babe by the way, and he was very nice and dealt with 7 of us which was probably difficult for him. There were other goodlooking servers too so that's always a plus, right?The food was pretty good, and the prices for pastas were surprisingly cheap. We tried some of the pizza also and it was very cheesy and good!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite places.  However, on a recent visit, the sausage was full of gristle, not fun to eat and I am not picky.  The pepperoni pizza was good although all the food is much too salty.  Wings are still great."}
{"text":"Theres 2 things i don't like about this restaurant. 
1) Waited 57 minutes just to get to my table. 
2) The shirts that say \"Legalize Marinara\".

But there are many things that out number those 2 things. The servers are nice and friendly, but when they are busy it seems like they rush. The garlic bread is amazing!!! Maybe the best garlic bread I ever ate. The lasagna was pretty good, but you have to wait 1/2 an hour to get it. The all you can eat pasta bowl was good, like always, and if you can't eat a second bowl you can just bring it home free of charge! The meatball sub was HUGE, my dad could only eat 1/2 the sub! But what kind of trip is it if you don't get the pizza cookie? The pizza cookie is the best dessert ever!!! Words can't describe how good this restaurant is."}
{"text":"I used to come here strictly for the pizookie... It's the most delicious dessert and I can never find the strength to pass it up.

Then I came to realize that their food is equally as amazing as the pizookie.  I don't eat wings, but their sauce is so good, I'd love to buy a bottle of that stuff.  I've been ordering their Veggie Wedgie sandwich or the barbecue pizza when I'm with my cousin.. She adds all kinds of toppings to the pizza and I would recommend ordering a pizza w/ bbq sauce and then whatever else appeals to you.. (Thin crust of course, it's the best PLUS their thick crust usually takes a little less than an hour to make)  I guarantee you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This place is so overrated . We ate at the one in Cave Creek and the service was slow and they got our order totally wrong. The manager was extremely rude and incompetent at best! This place has forgotten its roots and needs to get back to the basics of providing good food at a reasonable price instead of hiring smart ass kids to run their business!"}
{"text":"To be able to say that everything you've ever eaten at a restaurant has been fantastic is quite a statement, however I can honestly say that about Oregano's. I fell in love with this place from the first time I ate there and I've never looked back. I've tried a lot of pizza in my 27 years here as a Phoenix native, and this place probably has the best pizza in town. The Italian Gold wings are to die for, the kick butt garlic bread is unlike any garlic bread you'll find anywhere else, and the drinks and desserts are both unique and fantastic. Add a friendly, upbeat wait staff to these things, and you have a dining experience that will keep you coming back. Be prepared to wait, especially on Friday or Saturday evenings, because it is a popular place. However, it will be worth the wait, every single time."}
{"text":"Called for a single thin pizza for carry-out at 4:45 and was told it would take 2 hours. Seriously, if you can't handle carry-out orders in a reasonable time, don't offer carry-out. But I decided to order anyway. Went to pick up the pizza at 6:35 thinking I would wait a few minutes to get it just out of the oven. Not so, it was already sitting there. Took it out to the car and my wife opened it to find the pizza almost cold. I wasn't going to wait another 2 hours for a hot one.  Some of you may enjoy cold pizza but I will never order from there again.
This seems to be a Surpirse location issue. I live only a mile from it but before it opened I ordered a carry-out from the Goodyear location and drove 10 miles there to pick it up. No long preparation time and it was very hot when I picked it up. Even after driving it home it was hotter than the one from the Surprise location."}
{"text":"Typical \"upscale\" chain kinda place; retro decor (which was nice; besides old time posters and what-not they had a Fred Astaire movie and The Lone Ranger playing on the tube, as opposed to the normal sports vomit) and all the bar food you can eat with cutesy names.

I went here mostly because I wanted what I think of as Chicago style pizza, which is what they call \"stuffed\" here. It was tasty, what I expected, and our waitress was accommodating and outgoing.

Not really sure why anyone would get the normal Chicago-style (thin crust) they have there; as my wife commented: \"The shredded parmesan they spread over the pizza is thicker than the crust!\" but hey, isn't my problem if someone wants to pay $18 for a 3 oz. piece of dough stretched to oblivion.

I DIGRESS. In any case, an okayish place. Just don't come here if you're looking to get seated fast, as it's always packed, or if you want some kind of authentic Italian pizza or small business experience."}
{"text":"I echo the previous reviewers - excellent pizza/salads/soups. Cute Americana ambiance. 

But also, there's BEER. We must not neglect to mention the opportunity to imbibe quality beers at this fine establishment! I savored a pint of Sierra Nevada while promptly finishing half a pie (it's thin crust, so I'm not as big a pig as I sound) and THAT is what pushes my lunches there from good to great!

Hint: The wings are just okay, so save your belly real-estate for the pizza/beer!"}
{"text":"First time at any Oregano's. It'll be a while before the second. Famished, I ordered the Big Chicken Parm Sub. What arrived was a meager, flattened and breaded, piece of chicken on an over toasted roll with a hint of marinara. I waited 5 minutes to be asked how \"...things are tasting so far\" before I could ask for marinara for the sandwich. By then I had lost my appetite and returned it with a smile. My wife's pasta was good but she was bummed to eat alone. We had no visit from a manager and no apology for this item not being nearly as described. The table next to us was handled with equal disinterest when they? found hair in their dessert. Maybe someday another location, but I'll pass this joint. I'll add though that our waitress, Alyssa, was very nice."}
{"text":"Excellent food! However the aspect of this visit that I think is the best was our waitress, Caroline! She was such a sweetheart, and she was very attentive. This is one of the best places to eat Italian food in my opinion."}
{"text":"We visited Oregano's the week of Thanksgiving. The food was ok but the service was horrible. We over ordered so that we could bring home leftovers. The next evening when I ate my leftover pizza I discovered BROKEN GLASS in my food and IN MY MOUTH. This was absolutely horrifying and we immediately called the restaurant and spoke with the manager who took a message. After a couple of days we received a call from a regional manager who filed a report with their insurance company. And since then we haven't received any follow up or heard back from anyone.  I am absolutely shocked at the lack of service, response and concern. I will absolutely never return and would suggest for health dept to further investigate."}
{"text":"Clearly a very disappointing visit to Oregano's.  

Always been a fan of this place, but the quality sure seems to be on the downward spiral.  The Beefstro Salad my ultimate favorite lacked dressing and not much beef i.e. totally lacked the zing.  The pasta was very average and the sausage was kept whole on the side, not mixed in and nothing special about the Chipolte Sauce.  In summary very average.  I could have gone to Trader Joe's got some of their fancy pasta sauce, pasta and sausage and replicated the same.

Sadly this place is now a hit and miss, as its not my second time that they have come up short.  While this chain is growing, keeping quality and service that made them a regular favorite is something that seems to be a challenge."}
{"text":"1 at time at this location, it seems like they are still working the kinks out of the system. The ones in flagstaff or Tempe are the best but they also have been around for years!!

Sandwich was good but smaller portions than the other locations. They were having trouble with computer so the check took a while.

Overall I'd say average. But in sure it will improve."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service!!! I did a Togo order and over the phone the lady was so pleasant, from the time I walked into the door to the time I left everyone was so helpful and delightful, the food was great as well, I'm glade we made this our choice for lunch today even though it is very much out of our way!!"}
{"text":"Hands down this place is popular and busy, but I've just never had that great of an experience at any of the locations.  I'm happy that a local business has been so successful and been able to expand throughout the state.

But there is just always something that steers me wrong.  This trip the waiter informed us that there was dairy in the marinara sauce....well just scratch the bulk of the menu for me.  Sure, Italian meals are heavily based around cheese, but there are very few other options on the menu as an entree.

Everyone else walked away happy...so I'm the odd man out.  I was in the mood for pasta and walked away only sampling guacamole, garlic bread, and nibbled on some sweet potatoes fries.  Would really like to see some more health conscious (lighter) options besides a 4lb salad.

Pros:
Busy and lively atmosphere
Huge portions (hopefully to take home)
Well priced
Great for families

Cons:
Always a wait
Feel like watching 'The Biggest Loser' afterwards"}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero if I could. Pizza took over and hour to make and it was literally cheese thrown onto a cracker. Pretty disappointed. Started to make me feel sick shortly after. I could only eat 1 slice. On top of that service was just odd. Something about the people there made me feel uncomfortable. Don't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! Everything I've tried here has been fantastic. Plus the wait staff is excellent."}
{"text":"Oregano's is always our first stop when we are back in the Phoenix area. On our last visit, they were about to close, but happily took our order for carry out. The food is great - and the service even better!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of pizza and I am always looking for a good inexpensive pizza place and boy did I find one. Has to be the best pizza in the Scottsdale AZ area."}
{"text":"Bummer about their policy about not seating you until the whole party is present, but no big deal. Good food, great customer service. I ordered The Original Bollo Pasta which is all you can eat for $7 before tax/tip. However, what I'd calculated to be about a $10 meal before tax/tip turned out to cost me nearly double. I added meat for $3.29 and thought it was also all you can eat -- nope (so don't make that mistake like I did). To add one type of meat for $3.29 one time only was definitely not worth it. However this seemed like an error on my end so I don't fault Oregano's (except that they could have written it more clearly on the menu). Overall I'm a fan and will return."}
{"text":"The Pizza is great and service is always speedy. The last waitress I had sucked balls. She was rude, but maybe she woke up on the wrong side of the bed.Try the Heck A Slice for lunch, good deal."}
{"text":"Oregano's is a valley institution.  In addition to their famous deep-dish pizza, try the Big Ol' Bowl O' Pasta with Spicy Marinara.  Crowds are a problem so get there as early as possible - before 5pm if you can.  Parking can also be a hassle so be prepared for a hike if necessary.  Great beers on tap and a delectable set of desserts - try the Pizookie!  Sooooo goood!"}
{"text":"Best deep dish pizza in arizona!!!!

There is a long wait, but that is perfect timing to enjoy a beer and a bask in the sun on a sunday afternoon.

Dont leave without trying a macadamia nut pzookie!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good but the music was so loud we had to shout to the waiter so he could take our order. We asked and the folks at the table behind us too, if they could turn the music down but he told us the GM wanted it LOUD I  won't go back because of the noise. Staff was great"}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars because the prices have doubled in the past 4 years.  We have been coming here for 9 years.  Almost $80 for a family of 4 with 2 small kids.  We used to come once a week.  Now it is once every 6 weeks....  We like Oreganos, but we can take our kids to Flemings Steakhouse for not much more than what we pay here.  I noticed we got in without a wait.  We used to wait 1.5 hours no matter what day of the week.  When will these owners learn?  They think we don't know that with every new menu design is a price increase.  Good luck Oreganos.  We might see you twice a year now...."}
{"text":"TRY THE VINO BAMBINO SALAD! My fiance and I split a Jr. sized salad quite often (yes, their portions are THAT BIG) and we keep coming back for more! Bring your friends, even if you think you can handle it, chances are the portions will be way too big for you. At least you're getting your money's worth, right? The staff is always really friendly, although since their food is made FRESH, it can sometimes be a long wait before you get the food... but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Super yummy!  The wait can get pretty long, but totally worth it. The pizza cookie and boom dip are money!"}
{"text":"Wow as always have had Excellent Service and the Food is Great

The Chicago deep dish and the Chicago thin crust pizzas are excellent they have a lot of great appetizers and the Pablo salad is delicious 

Great meatball sandwiches along with the Italian sausage sandwich are very good 

When I am in the Phoenix area I always make sure that I will go out to this restaurant at least once.

Only problem is when you travel alone they give you so much it's hard to make a decision what you want 

I recommend taking a big party or anything more than two people so you can try different items."}
{"text":"Now this is a restaurant that you want to tell everybody about! Problem is, so does everyone else who comes here! It's packed, so either get in early or just expect to be awhile, which considering, it's a great way to spend some time with friends! Food is phenomal. The deep dish Chicago style pizza is good as it get, west of the mississippi! And, one the most impressive things about Oregano's is their service! Staff is well trained and looks out for the smallest detail to make your evening enjoyable, very refreshing!"}
{"text":"So great!! Everyone was very friendly and our food was delicious! It was Italian with a twist of mexican."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of weeks ago and got take out. My big rig pasta was missing it's garlic bread and the pasta was over cooked and mushy. My fiancé's beef sandwich was missing it's cole slaw. I've gone to this restaurant to eat as well in the recent past and felt the service was crappy and the food was mediocre. Think I'm done giving this establishment my money.. Recommend you find a different, less crowded, less loud and less over priced Italian restaurant. Unless you like not being able to hear each other talk and having crappy services plus a high bill, by all means."}
{"text":"To previous post... Wait times DO matter. Certainly new restaurants will have longer waits, but there are open tables everywhere and hoards of people waiting outside. Can't imagine they will sell many stuffed pizzas here, wait 1+hr to sit, then 45 min more for stuffed pizza.? In Chicago, they take your order for stuffed pizza while you wait for table, that way when u sit down, pizza isn't far behind and they are able to keep wait times down. 
Overall, food was good. Servers polite. Had thin crust pizza. Waited 1 1/2 hrs on Thursday evening."}
{"text":"This is the worst Oregano's. The wait is forever so we do takeout...which we now have learned is always at least an hour wait. Plus, when we go to pick it up there's always an extra 15 mn wait just to pay and get our food, which is a JOKE. I'm not sure how this place continues to be so busy. The food is pretty good but the service is horrible. Not sure why they don't hire more people or more managers."}
{"text":"We started with wings, garlic lime parmesan. Best sauce ever, nicely balanced with nothing over powering. Then we moved on to the pesto pizza. Thin crust, tomatoes and light cheese. But the last was a disappointing eggplant parmesan.  Skin still on and so thin that there was more breading than eggplant. Should have stopped at the pizza."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed!  Worst experience at an Oregano's. So mad I was the one who recommended going there for lunch with my husband. He gets his food, which was wrong & that was it. Mine never showed up. When the server assisting our main server brought again the wrong item for my husband, she asked if there was anything else we needed. Ah, yay, my food. Clueless, she goes to check. Comes back a few minutes later & starts cleaning the table next to us. Hello, did you find my salad??  She says yes, your server is getting it. Out he comes & starts assisting another table. He finally comes over & admits it was never submitted. He then places my salad order again & attempts to correct my husbands order. 20 minutes later the salad arrives with the correct side order for my husband. He's been done eating for 15 minutes, so what was the point? I get my salad to go because we were short on time. 

I ordered a $6.00 glass of wine which took forever to get, but at least I got it. Sure enough, we are charged for everything. Shame on you Oregano's. At least comp the wine, if not the salad I never got to enjoy for lunch. I'll be hard pressed to ever recommend going back. So disappointing. Being in the service industry, this could have been handled so much better than it was."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday with a party of three at 5:30 pm. Told it would be a 30 min. Wait and we went outside to pass the time. After about 30 min. Hostess called our name for a party of two. We advised her that we were three people and she said we would have to wait longer for a larger table to open up. We were seated after 40 min. total. Ordered a thin crust pizza, rigatoni, and another entree which I can't remember. After waiting almost an hour, the rigatoni showed up by itself. The food runner had no idea about the rest of our order. ( why does a thin crust pizza take an hour to make?) At about 7:15, we decided to leave as we were really tired of waiting and things weren't looking good. Spoke to the manager on the way out.. no apology from her, no offer of a coupon to try and get us to come back again. If this place doesn't get their act together they aren't going to make it."}
{"text":"Great dinner tonight at Oregano's! Every aspect was stellar. See pics for what we ordered... it was all fantastic! Portions are humongous and so affordable! Great combo right there. If you are in the Scottsdale area you got to try this place!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, I had a Big Salad and it was big, and the appetizer serving of garlic bread was delicious, too!  But, in my opinion, they need to address the noise level, having a conversation is impossible!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The waiter Giovanni made my first experience marvelous.He's so polite and patient helped us figure out what would be tasty ! Definetly will return cause of him ."}
{"text":"Today I'm getting married in just a few hours and I had to take the time to write a review for this location. Here's why, last night my soon to be husband and I, as well as our daughter went to Oreganos for dinner. We chose to come here because it was at oreganos where we had our first date! And we have been continuing to go ever sense! The staff caught wind that we would be getting married that fallowing day, and to make it special for us they surprised us with a lovely bottle of champagne and an adorable card signed by all the staff! It was such a kind gesture, and really made our night! I wanted to thank all the staff at Oreganos for making our night something really special!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken parm sandwich, meatball sandwich and wings....fairly expensive which was fine until we experienced the quality. Wings were horrible, small and very fatty. Waffle fries were soggy and luke warm. Sandwiches were average. Lots of food choices in Tempe, this is not a do over for us."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Portions are large, enough for 2 meals. Save room for the most amazing dessert ever!"}
{"text":"Love the Big Rig. Servers are very friendly...and the meatballs are delicious!"}
{"text":"Great Pasta and I have gotten Catered Food from them and it was great!!! Large portions, Attention to detail, Friendly service and Amazing Caesar Dressing!!!"}
{"text":"loved the serving staff. Our hostess seated us early and our waiter was very friendly and prompt. The Kick-butt cheese bread was kick-butt. But beware, they don't skimp on the garlic. Our entrees are very good as well."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food from Oreganos which was very good. Pizza wings salad all delicious. Unfortunately our server Conner did the bare minimum at best. Never took the menues away, no side plates with food, no pre bussing whatsoever. Waited on bar drinks and water refills forever. Good job kitchen but not very pleased with our service. For a busy monday night and the money spent by everyone would expect exceptional service. Will try again some other time cause the food is that good."}
{"text":"I love their pizzas, super thin crust, huge beers including a selection from our local brewer Four Peaks.  And the people are great, waitress was really friendly, they had a cooler outside for when we were waiting and came around with drinks and free pizza samples.
BUT two hours in and out is just too long.  We went on a Friday night and called ahead but they said they don't take reservations.  Arrived at 5 pm, was seated around 6 pm.  Like I said, they take care of you while you are waiting and we were hanging out with friends socializing.  But then we ordered a Pizza and Calzone and it took another 40 minutes for the food to arrive.
So I give Oregano's 4 stars at other locations I have been to (Mesa, Scottsdale) but this location loses a star for the length of the wait."}
{"text":"Went to dinner the other night and the service was horrible. Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes. The waiter was talking to other staff like we didn't even exist and the manager there is clueless.  Would definitely not recommend and this is not the first time this has happened."}
{"text":"We came for the pizza and left LOVING the salads and pastas, too!!  This place should be rated higher!!  I've tried 3 of the pasta dishes.  All were amazing!  Big Rigg  Pasta, their Alfredo After dark (think that's what it's called), and the lasagna were all Awesome!  The meatballs have great flavor, too!  My kids LOVE their pizza and ask to go there all the time.  The wait staff have always been great with the kids and accommodating!  We all love this place."}
{"text":"Never sent two dishes back at a restaurant before in my life. Pesto Penne bake was dry as shit, then ordered a the Chicken Alfredo which had jalapeños and feta cheese in it? The marinara sauce had enough oregano to take down a baby elephant. The bowl of cereal at home though was excellent. Probably won't be back ever."}
{"text":"The food is always good, but it took 16 minutes to even be acknowledged by the waitstaff. Very frustrating especially when employees are standing around and chatting."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast food, go to McDonalds, But if you want a true experience in italian food, this is ur place! Excellent wine, perfectly prepared from scratch dishes, great atmosphere, an all around excellnt experience! Looking for a fun dinner with friends or a date? Bring it! If u hav a bad time here, it's your fault! Not theirs."}
{"text":"After living in Chicago, I know what good pizza is, so I'm a picky pizza person (try saying that 3 times fast). But, I do go here for the pasta. I get cravings for the Bolla Pasta with meat sause. It is so good! I also like to go there during the day for their wings. I think its just their atomosphere. Yes, the wait can be a little long, but if you are around and hungry at a random time ( like yesterday we went at 3:30) then you are seated right away. The staff is super nice and they really like their jobs so you aren't getting grumpy servers who you feel you have to tip. Our parents like to go here when they visit for the food and music. 

Haven't tried the cookie dessert yet, but I'm almost there!"}
{"text":"I go here once every couple months or so, and it's always great. The Stuffed Italian sandwich and the Antipasta Salad are both solid choices. On one occasion, I ordered two entrees to-go, but they messed up one of them. I called the restaurant, and they had me come back to pick up the order, at which point the manager gave me a brand new meal and refunded the cost of it to my card after apologizing for the mistake. It's just nice that they own a mistake and make it up to you. Also, the pizza and drinks there are awesome as well - will definitely continue going here..."}
{"text":"Called in a kale salad at 630pm for 730 pickup last night- waited 15 minutes at the to go counter before being acknowledged. I was then asked if I had a take out order and then the gal turned around and left without asking for a name. Manager was busy discounting the order prior to mine as they evidently screwed it up. It then took 5 minutes to change the register tape and they couldn't process orders- I finally left empty handed- this place is a complete dumpster fire!"}
{"text":"Visiting from San Antonio so daughter can visit ASU.  Food was delicious, atmosphere/ambiance was great.  But the best part of our visit was our super friendly, service oriented waitress, Jocelyn!  She served us with a bubbly personality and even happened to be same major my daughter was considering, and gave us feedback in that arena.  Jocelyn also recommended visiting Mesa before heading back to S.A..  great experience at Oregano's!"}
{"text":"I am giving this one 3 stars because I have always liked Oregano's, although it was usually the Scottsdale locations.  This was my first time at this location in Goodyear... it was a Saturday night and packed like I expected it to be... we got there around 8 and were quoted a 40 minute wait time.  We decided to just eat at the bar, no big deal.  Drinks are reasonably priced... they don't have frozen margaritas or drinks other than a frozen peach bellini concoction that they have from a machine back there.  It was meh.

Lemme just warn you if you aren't already aware - the portion sizes are HUGE here... on one hand it's great cause you get more for your money, but we literally almost filled up on our appetizer and by the time the dinner came we weren't that interested lol.  Ordered the stuffed mushrooms - it ended up being 2 gigantic portobello mushrooms each filled with a mountain of ground sausage and then topped with cheese.  They were tasty.  

I then got the eggplant parm, but it just was mediocre at best.  It was a meager size portion of some slices of eggplant (not breaded) on top of a ginormous bed of overcooked angel hair pasta.  I am someone who likes a generous amount of sauce as well, and they were very stingy with the sauce.  When I asked for more on the side, I got a ramekin of thick sauce.  Weird... I basically ate the eggplant and garlic bread and a couple bites of pasta but it was just way too much food for me to finish even if I was STARVING.  My friend got the white pizza and he liked it, but could barely eat that much because he was full too. 

I will definitely go back to Oregano's!  Just not on a Weekend night."}
{"text":"Great pizza, love the thin crust! Service and atmosphere is well above average. Prices are reasonable and lots of options on the menu, including pasta and sandwiches in addition to 3 kinds of pizza, thin, pan and stuffed crust."}
{"text":"Living close to here has destroyed my diet so many times! but its worth it. 
Parking sucks or else this place would get 5 stars"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My friends and I are regulars here because of their amazing food, but today I forgot my card and was short on cash :( but the manager comped it for us!! SO NICE!! Would give 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant two trys, both times, it was a disaster! After waiting, we were informed our pizza was mistakenly given to someone else. They replaced it with a small pizza. Although we were given a free ice cream cookie, we would have preferred our dinner. The second visit began with them not taking reservations for a group of 18. We were advised to have someone in our party come an hour early and wait for the tables. We did... They gave our tables away! Not much communication between hostess and Waiter. The food was fine. AWhen we received our credit card bill, they had double charged us! Bottom line. Although Cave Creek was excited to welcome Oregano's to our town, it has been a Huge disappointment and not worth the wait, frustration or money. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd written a review for Oregano's.  We like Oregano's, normally, the Bellini is my favorite drink ever. Tonight our experience wasn't that good. I've emailed the corporate office, a copy of that email is below. 

Tonight my husband and I went to the Oregano's located on Priest and Elliott in Tempe, AZ.   We go to that location a couple times a month. 

Tonight we ordered our regular order of Belini, Pepsi, Boom dip, Bollo Pasta, and Italian Stuffed sandwich. On the way through the dining area the wings smelled really good. At first I didn't want to wait for them, then I decided, I'd order them and take them home. 

We were out on the patio. As the waitress was packing up our left overs, she kept taking them inside.We heard a commotion just inside the door and I turned around to see a box on the floor with the familiar checked paper sticking out. Four of the wait staff gathered to discuss what to do. I told my husband \"they are going to give me the wings like nothing happened\". 

And that is exactly what they did. They put the wing box on the bottom, my leftover Bollo on top in the bag and set it down. She took my husbands sandwich to box and when she came back. I asked: \"was that my wings that just dropped\" and the waitress replied \"oh but we're getting you a new order\". 

I'm irritated by this point, the manager came out and said \"we've taken the charge off your bill, and we are getting you a FULL order of wings\". Well, it was 12 of 14 wings, I had left, so this wasn't much of huge difference for me. I returned the dropped wings. We decided to leave before receiving the wings. 

I'm not upset that my wings dropped. I'm upset that they weren't upfront about it, and I'm upset that the manager was acting like she was doing me a favor. What I believe should have happened was; The server should have came to me, said \"hey the box dropped, but nothing fell out, we can give you these wings, and take them off your tab, or we can make you new wings but it will take 20 mins\". This leaves the options up to me while maintaining the honesty in the relationship. 

Please do not make this about the server, this is obviously the influence of bad management as there was more than one server involved.

We won't be back for a while. We're not sure if we should even eat the left overs, who knows what happened out of our eye sight?"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Mark went out of his way to make sure we were taken care."}
{"text":"This is my first review. I love Yelp and have used the reviews for over a year now, but now I am obligated to write my first review because the poor service I keep receiving at Oregano's.  I have been a customer of this establishment for over 10 years, and have been receiving poor service from every location.  It's too bad that the service is so bad, because this place has the potential of being one of the best in town. The poor service and poor managing is a reflection of the ownership.  I know I am not the only one who feels this way.  Mr. Mark please, please, please change your ways, or retire so we can enjoy the great food that keeps you in busness."}
{"text":"Good, but be prepared to wait 

This was our second time at the PV mall location--we were part of a group of six and actually scored six seats at the bar while waiting.  Not bad for a Saturday night at around 8:45.  The seats were at the outside bar, and while it was crazy hot outside, the misters and fans made it more comfortable.  Contact lens wearers should beware of the fans, though.  The pizza was very good (I'm from Chicago so a tough judge on this one).  We tried the El Picasso (a southwestern pizza), which was pretty good and came crispy as ordered.  Our friends opted for a more traditional pizza, which was also very good.   I definitely recommend ordering a salad or some type of app if you're hungry when you come in--because you're waiting for a table (can be long) and then again for pizza (can be another 45 minutes).  

I like the character of the Scottsdale Rd/Shea location much better, but just getting in on a Saturday night was a pretty big deal.   We'll be back"}
{"text":"Awful!

3rd time we have tried this crappy chain. Our order was wrong and was basically told \"Sorry, do you want to wait 45 minutes for the right one?\" by the manager. Service was slow and unengaged, we had our salad before our drinks. 
They treated us like nothing but a tip and a waste of their adolescent time. 
Manager tried to smooth things over with a cookie, and over heard him doing it with the table right next to us! We were walking out the door, giving up on waiting for said cookie that now my 5 year old had his heart set on (THANKS waitress), when she magically discovered it was ready. Not to mention spent $75 for a &15 Little Caesar's meal.  Last time, I will never recommend this over priced McDonald's version of pizza that rides on their brand name instead of service and quality. There is way better ANYWHERE you go try, Maize's, St. Francis (great for kids), Postinos up the street or Pizza Bianco."}
{"text":"One of the best places to grab a meal valley-wide. I've had almost everything on their menu, simply can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had a great experience at this location. We were greeted immediately and sat at the bar. The manager, Michael was very personable and friendly. He was helping all of the employees and I appreciate that so much as I work with the public. Eric the bartender was very nice as well and super attentive to our needs. We will definitely be back to this location! Thank you so much for the great service and awesome food!! :) thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My lovely lady, myself and our 3 year old birthday boy came in and didn't expect a wait. And after getting a friendly smile from the bartender, we decided to sit at the bar. (I know, a little weird to have our toddler there) As soon as we sat down, we immediately knew we made the right decision...seeing the bartender knew exactly how to take care of my family. David was probably the best and friendliest bartender we've ever had the pleasure of sitting with. He was quick, extremely personable...and catered to our son like no other restaurant staff has before. Our son Benjamin was ecstatic when David brought out a pizza cookie with a candle for him to blow out. 

Honestly we live near happy valley and 67th...and this oreganos just happened to be the one we were near at the time. However, after meeting and having the time of our lives due to the service, we are going to continue to make the drive to this oreganos. 

Furthermore, constantly having new business associates I have to take out to lunch on a weekly basis, there is no doubt making a trip to this restaurant is definitely within reason. Great job and thank you guys again for everything."}
{"text":"Why is it always crowded?  Seems like everyone loves Oregano's.  A varied menu with great choices especially pizzas and sandwiches.  Great service.  Easy parking. A salad is big enough for an entire family!  The server always asks us if we want a traveler for our ice tea.  Sometime to remind you of your dining pleasure on your way home."}
{"text":"This is a casual local chain, which is very popular.  Why?  If you like good Italian casual dining with lots of choices and great value, this is why locals flock to Oreganos and it also explains their growth in the Phoenix area.  Love their lunch pizzas.  Very good but hard to finish.  Have to take some home for later.  Salads are LARGE.  Sandwiches are exceptional in choice and quality.  Also, have to take some home for later.  LARGE.  Haven't tried the pasta dishes, but they are popular and in some cases unlimited.  Pizzas are also very good and come in a large variety, thin crust or deep dish.  Easy to see why I always want to return, which I do. Oh yes, they offer you a traveler--your soft drink or tea in a container when you are on the road.  Makes me feel good."}
{"text":"There is only one downside to this place and that is, that it is so popular, the wait for seating and food-to-table times can vary and be quite long.  With that being said, if you anticipate this, Oregano's is one of the most unique and savory pizza / Italian joints around.  The portions are ridiculous, even a small is like a large or an extra large.  Pizza is unbelievable and the time capsule of the ambiance is really special.  They take you back to the 50's and 60's and with great customer service, they really bring back a piece of childhood with the food served family style to such unique themes.  Reminds me of eating at the dinner table or living room with the family when I was little.  They have a great entry outside dining concept with little Italian tables and chairs, along with a cool wine / open outdoor walk up bar to help you forget about the wait time to be seated.  Really well executed.  Wish they were closer to home in California."}
{"text":"Horrible service, whether busy or not.
Pizza is always limp, soggy or undercooked.
Baked Tuna Sandwich is bitchin'.
Pizza Cookie is ok.
Go to Scottsdale or Tempe location instead."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious pizza. I could eat 2 12 inches. Good cheesy garlic bread too.  Try the rosemary chicken potato pizza."}
{"text":"Oreganos is always amazing....i can order just about anything on the menu and it will be fantastic!!! On a casual night i go for the deep dish.  It takes a while to cook but is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon rainy day first timer experience ~ Our server Jackie was great (and normally I don't remember their names but she was THAT good). My DH ordered a sausage sandwich and was concerned about \"just how spicy is it?\" Jackie said it wasn't \"that hot\" but it had a kick to it. Spice is subjective and to us it was very spicy. Jackie was very attentive as she was working many areas and hustling, she was quick to apologize and asked to bring him something else.  DH ordered an Italian Beef Sandwich as a substitute. It was delicious. They use a Havarti cheese that gives a nice taste that we haven't found anywhere else.  The sandwich was moist and juicy A+. Made me wish I had ordered one instead of my flat cheese pizza, but he was nice enough to share  = )  The waffle cut fries were also a hit.

The manager could not have been nicer and stopped by our table to make sure everything was to our liking twice. Adam/manager and Jackie would be reason enough for us to come back again....not to mention that sandwich! 

Being newbies to Oregano's, every dish that was carried past us had us drooling as we said  \"mmmmm next time lets order that\".  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing (Grandma G's and pesto are my faves)!   However, if you are one of those that must get something other than pizza at the pizza parlor the Pesto Penne Bake is delicious.  

If you really want a bang for your buck, the Bollo Pasta is endless from 11 to 3 during the week.

Make sure you save room for dessert, a delicious pizza cookie.  Partially baked dough with ice cream, what could be better?

Oh yeah, better parking."}
{"text":"Oregano's has to be the best place to eat in the entire state of Arizona! Once AZ domination has completed please expand out of state; the country, no, the WORLD needs access to your pizza!

What's good? Everything I have ever had!

The best has to be Grandma G's (hold the Gorgonzola!!!!!!), Sproccoli with roma tomatoes and meatballs, and the pesto penne bake.

And you better save room for a pizookie - peanut butter chocolate is the way to go.


The parking here is great, but making a left off of Dobson northbound can seem like a game of chicken - proceed with caution!"}
{"text":"It is a good spot, and they are very busy during lunch. The pizza was just ok. The ingredients are fresh. It took 45 minutes for the pizza to come out."}
{"text":"Loved the service we received from our server Carrie...she was amazing! 
She was so courteous and friendly!
Have a funny story about our pizza that I ordered...I could only eat one piece, so I asked if I could get a to go box...she smiled and came back and started to attempt to put this huge deep dish pizza in the box with this small spatula..I had to stop myself from laughing as I watched her rearrange this beautiful pizza...she felt so bad and kept saying she was sorry as I busted out laughing! She finally got it in the box and started to put the pizza back together by patting it with the spatula...it was hysterical! I told her as we were all laughing now ..that its no big deal!
Next time just slide it in the box...
She was such a great sport about it!
It was so refreshing to see such great customer service! She had a great sense of humor! She is a gem!
Hope she gets the recognition she deserves!
Great Job Carrie! We will be back and hope to have you as our server again!
Thanks again for making our night fun! The food and service was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, and food. Enjoyed a Chicago thin crust Numero One-O and garlic bread. It is refreshing to find a great pizza chain this good."}
{"text":"I strongly recommend the Julius Cesar Salad, don't forget to add chicken, I'm a big fan of salads. I think it costs around 13 dlls but the price is worth it, you won't regret it, also make sure to get a small size salad, I can eat a lot of food, and it only takes a small size salad for me to be full, enjoy."}
{"text":"Literally by far the best bbq chicken pizza ever!!!! The pazookie is also fantastic. The only negative I have is the drinks :/ but the food by far makes up for it!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Oregano's for many years. My all-time favorite dish is the Big Rig pasta.  It is a creamy pasta with a delicious kick of cilantro.  I also love the pesto penne bake (pesto and pasta in bread bowl) as well as the bollo pasta (unlimited pasta with delicious marinara sauce).  For an appetizer I love the calamari and the cheesy garlic bread.  The pazookie is the perfect dessert-  hot, soft, partially cooked cookie with ice cream on top.  The prices are good and you will have leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"Oregano's is always tasty!  Whether it's pizza, pasta, salads or appetizer, is all good. But don't forget the Bellenis...they are my favorite! At least twice a month for several years and still sounds good."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place for pizza. If someone, somehow, extended an invitation to me to rename this chain, it would be Orgegano's Giant Salad Bistro or Oregano's Amazing Sandwich Bistro or even Oregano's Bellinis and Pizzookies Bistro. Those are what I love about this place. The pizza in my mind is a little weak - I don't like how they cute them in squares and the flavors are too overpowering, like they need to take of one ingredient on each menu item. But everything else is AWESOME - their Italian Gold wings are sooo good and the Oregano's Favorite Salad - its literally the size of your HEAD."}
{"text":"I had eaten at the old Scottsdale location of Oreganos many times. In order to have a larger building the old town location moved a while back. I gave the new building a few chances. I just can't continue to go there. The place is now such a cave. You can tell they did as little as possible to get the place open. But that's not what really sealed the deal. I actually have stopped going to Oreganos all together since they changed their pasta supplier. The new pasta has a terrible consistency and is very gummy. I had been going to Oreganos for about 15 years but the changes that have been made recently have stopped me from going to all locations. It's sad that it used to be my favorite restaurant but when they seem to have traded quality for profit it's no
longer the place it used to be."}
{"text":"This was the best motha effin panookie ive ever had. mmmmmm gimme that panookieeeee mommy."}

{"text":"Took my brother to dinner here tonight
Andrew was a amazing server my brother is very picky and loved the service and his order of delicious meatballs as he said they were juicy cheese and flavorful
I was here on July 4 th also and all i can say what a place to spend a holiday of this USA 
And Adam was our bartender 

So if you go to eat ask for Andrew section but if you go to bar ask for Adam"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night. Was pretty busy with about 40 minute wait outside and  40 more for food. Ordered the Italian Flag lasagna. Sauce was pretty salty and unimpressive. Also had a slice of the pan pizza which was thick with cheese. The pizza dough was a bit soggy and not very tasty. This pizza was nothing special and a bit of a dud which is surprising bc pizza is one of those foods hard to do wrong."}
{"text":"Ordered bollo pasta with 2 meatballs to go, for those that don't know... it's just a bowl of angel hair pasta with marinara sauce. While it was good, I felt like they really skimped me on the pasta, especially on something that they offer free refills of if you dine in.

I'm not a big eater by any means, it was disappointing. If someone orders just a bollo togo, why not hook them up on the pasta?"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service left a bad taste in our mouths. 

First of all, I'm no diva and do my best to be nice to people and not sweat the small stuff. I've been a manager and know how tough this kind of work can be. That said the experience here was pretty awkward and uncomfortable. 

Upon arriving and not seeing a huge crowd, we were told that it would be an hour and fifteen minute wait. We said ok, we'd like to check the bar. She rudely told us that it was full and gave my fiance the stink eye when he left. I trusted her and waited for him to come back. While I was waiting I overheard a surly exchange between the hostess and customer. 

\"What's the difference between this bar and the one inside?\"
Answer: \"This one is outside and that one is inside\"
Seeing the realization on her face that she was being rude, she \"politely\" added that the one outside had a different bartender too. 
\"What time do you close?\"
Answer: Basically a lot of complaining about customers coming in late which was code for \"I hate staying late\". Really not cool. Really bad for business. 

Anywho... seeing as my fiance wasn't back I guessed correctly that he scored us some bar seats. And there were two more down a ways. Full my ass. It was like she was trying to turn away business so she could leave early. It was only 8pm too!

Enter bartender... or ID Nazi. My fiance is 33 and rarely, if ever carded. No biggie, but the guy was kind of abrupt and not friendly. He then had a really awkward interaction with a girl that worked there. He was reprimanding her but did it in a very rude way. Not what I want to see. 

It took forever for us to put in our order and after we got our food and another employee came to sit down next to us we got the full brunt of bad juju at the restaurant. Apparently they've fired two managers recently and are going to clean house some more. 

Seriously. Keep your business inside your back room. I don't want to hear about it while I'm trying to relax. Customer service here needs a kick in the pants!

PS: Tell your people to stop yelling at customers on the way out to \"have a great night, thanks\" because it is so insincere that it is worse than saying nothing at all."}
{"text":"Today 5/23/15 decided to come in to oreganos with my family. We were really hungry. We had to wait a long time , but once we were served by Kevin . It was worth the wait!! I have no words other than we had a great service.(best service in my entire life!!) thanks Kevin defenetly coming back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a bit loud and busy as the place is popular. I had the fried calamari and the stuffed pan style pizza. The fried calamari was pleasurable and held me over in the wait for the pizza. My biggest complaint is that it does take a considerable amount of time to prepare the pizza (not something you can get around, so come when you have time). The pizza was fantastically delicious. They use a great quality cheese, the marinara sauce was good, and the quantity is definitely appropriate to price. Would recommend and will come again."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices....large portions for a good price! The thin crust pizza, garlic cheese bread, bowl o pasta, chicken Caesar salad and pizza cookie are my favs! Only dish I have tried and not liked is the shrimp scampi. It was a bit spicy and the type of pasta (curly noodle things) I didn't care for. This def a \"safe\" choice with good food and fun atmosphere if you are in charge of picking a place to eat. Oh but I should add service can be slow/it takes awhile for food to come out. It's prob because they are always packed."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat. Went there recently with my family and we all loved it!"}
{"text":"Oregano's Best chicken salad is my absolute favorite salad. Huge portion can never finish. I've also tried the chocolate chip cookie dessert and its amazing! I do my best to stay away from it tho.. Not an easy task.."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing, the staff was so friendly. The waiters, manager and anyone that spoke to us were very pleasant. Would definitely come back here when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First time here on Friday. The food was decent even after the long wait. Our server was good, busy though. What set this place apart for me was actually the hostess I encountered when I checked in. Courtney, ( the red head, I'm hoping I remembered it right) was writing down names when we got there. When she told us it was going to be an hour, we were going to leave but she convinced us to stay after suggesting things on their menu, making conversation with us, and giving us options for while we wait. We waited almost exactly as long as she said, we sat just a few minutes before our quote was up. Since they don't have buzzers or computers I was impressed with the accuracy. Was also impressed that she managed to smile through so many customers having bad attitudes with her. Never lost her cool for a second. In fact, she seemed to deescalate the situation and get people to stay, or at least calm down. Saw two or three people apologize for being rude to her, just because she managed to stay so nice! Will give it another try because of the friendly hostess!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  Their stuffed pizzas are amazing and the Boom Dip is truly the \"bomb\". Every server we have had has been energetic and had a good sense of humor.  The portions are very generous. We usually get away with ordering an appetizer and just one entrée."}
{"text":"Love it, I always order the Picasso Salad, occasionally a deep dish pizza, and a pizookie. The staff is always helpful with suggestions, and the food comes fast. But you have to order the pizookie!"}
{"text":"I had another excellent experience at this location and decided I would post the details. 
On the recommendation of my hostess I asked her to help me chose between the chicken Parm sandwich or meatball -  ( Amber I think)  was mindful as she said she liked them both a lot but thought that the chicken was lighter and because it was a dinner item It would be lighter. 
She was absolutely correct as this sandwich was a home run, full of flavor and oh so moist! I also had an opportunity to meet and thank Ryan the manager, who has to be grateful for such an energized , polite team! Thanks Ryan your team rocked it!"}
{"text":"After reading some great reviews about this place I had to try this place out.  First off you are going to have to wait awhile but it is worth the wait. For appetizer we had the long cheese bread which is so good, and the pizza is out of this world, you have to go with the thin crust, did not really enjoy the chicago style, the pizza is freaking tasty.  Then we topped it off with a pizza cookie, that things is so good. If you want some really good pizza and don't mind the wait then you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about Oreganos. I donde twice during my stay in Scottsdale. The atmosphere is fun and engaging. But both times I experienced the food as good enough. But it was nothing that would bring me back. I wanted to like the place. And of course you are not getting out of there for under $15 with tip. Not worth that."}
{"text":"Must visit if you enjoy a great slice of pizza. Every time I'm in Phoenix I stop by oreganos. I have been to multiple locations and each one is equally delicious and impressive. Fantastic service and great thin crust pizza. And the pizza cookie is DELICIOUS. Even if you aren't hungry you have to get one anyways and stuff yourself. Not a long wait either, but in the past I have found that it gets pretty busy and having a wait time isn't uncommon! The atmosphere is also fun. Fun music and lots too look at. Pass on the appetizers that way you can eat more pizza!  portions are very large for the price. Can't recommend this restaurant enough. Five stars isn't enough!"}
{"text":"Incomparable.  If you want Pizza Pie, this is the only place to go.  We have patronized this restaurant (actually the original store that only moved a couple of blocks so that they could accommodate more people) for many years now.  We have tried many a pizza joint in the valley and always come back to this one.  Oregano's is the place where you bring out of town guests; a place to meet with your local friends or just go with your significant other.  They have pizzas that satisfy the Meat Lover, the Vegan and the Gluten Free customer.  My favorite is the thin crusted Barbecued Chicken, my wife likes Pepperoni, so we usually order a half and half with a cold brew.  It has always been a happy experience with many good memories.  I highly recommend Oregano's to everyone and write this review because it is high time that I did."}
{"text":"Oregano's is pretty much always the same, you know what to expect. It's never amazing or incredibly poor, just a standard experience. EXCEPT FOR THIS TIME. I went here with a good friend of mine for my birthday and we had Colleen as a sever and she was FANTASTIC. The only reason this place is getting a 5 star review. She was kind, attentive, but not intrusive. You could tell she really enjoyed her job and cared about the guest in her section. (: great job and keep it up (:"}
{"text":"Ate dinner with my husband and baby on a Friday evening at 5:00 PM. Was quoted 30 minutes and was seated within that timeframe. Austin was our server, he was very friendly and attentive. We ordered right away and got our Cheesy Garlic Bread in just moments. Hot and fresh! We got the Pablo Picasso salad and a 12 inch thin build your own pizza for the two of us. The food came out perfect. Had A LOT of leftovers! Were in and out within an hour after being sat. Overall, a very pleasant visit and our service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Since posting my review, someone from Oregano's offered to send me a gift card as restitution. Though I received an empty envelope (it appears that the gift cards fell out in transit), the follow up was welcome in my book and earns them an extra star.

That said, I've been extra careful about checking my order before heading out. Numero One-o always hits the spot."}
{"text":"We normally love Oreganos but had the absolute WORST experience here tonight.  It took twice as long to get in as they estimated and that was at 9:30 at night, then we decided to order takeout and it took another huge wait,we asked for the status and they said the pizza was going to be another 10 minutes but we pushed them to check the status and it was already done while we waited for our salads, when does pizza take less time than salad????  We sat there watching the hostesses text and talk doing nothing to help the situation."}
{"text":"Avoid this location!  Seriously, drive 10 minutes out of your way to go to another location.
We love Oregano's and have been going to the old town and Scottsdale and Shea location for years.  Always great service and food.  But this location broke the mold in the worse way!  Our last visit we were told 35 minute wait, which is fine, so we had drinks at the bar.  40 minutes later the hostess told us our table was being cleared and she actually pointed to it.  5 minutes later another party is there, so we wait for another 20 minutes.  Finally get sat outside when we asked to be inside.  No one comes by for at least 10 minutes.  When they do we ask for the wobbly table to be fixed and our waitress tells us \"it's frowned upon\".  And it just got worse from there, wings, salad, pizza, pasta all came out in 10 minute intervals, no utensils, drop a beer off and run off with out getting another order...  Everyone in our party of 7 talking about how poor the service was.
It was a birthday so I choose to bite my tongue and call a manager later.  When I do he is very understanding and apologizes.  He says he is going to mail me a gift card and a week later, no gift card so I call back to check the address only to get another manager that takes my address again and promises to get back to or mail the gift card.  A week later, no gift card."}
{"text":"I live close to Oregano's, and our family always wanted to try this place out. 
What a better occasion than trying it for my 21st wedding anniversary. It was very packed, so we had the impression it was going to be phenomenal food. We sat outside, and we immediately fell in love with the environment. We sit there for 20 minutes and we order some drinks. Our service was nothing spectacular, and the server fail to suggest any options. We ordered the Big Rig Pasta; a very dry pasta with no flavor whatsoever. My daughter ordered Lady is A Scampi, very dry pasta as well not worth the money. Furthermore, Alfredo the Dark was dry pasta, little sauce topped with tomato.  In addition, the wings were extremely salty. The pizza was good. The only thing we loved was the dessert! Never coming back, I'd rather stick to the regular Olive Garden or Malee's on Main."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday at 6. That was a mistake, it was really busy and we had to wait about an hour. The wait was definitely worth it, we were served beers on the bench in the waiting area so the time passed by pretty fast. We started off with the italian sausage stuffed mushrooms. The sausage was spiced perfectly. Very good. For our main course we had the cajun chicken pesto thin crust and the veggie sandwich. The pizza was good, not much cajun flavor but well done. The veggie sandwich was out of this world good. The goat cheese and red pepper aioli made it outstanding. We then went to the hot cookie desert. Ridiculous. Save room for it. Next time I'm hoping to try one of the stuffed pizzas and the picasso salad. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Jose H. was such an amazing server! So accommodating and really made the experience one to remember. Food was also 5 stars! Get the Pablo Picasso"}
{"text":"As my fiancé and I walked in were greeted and attended in a timely matter. As we took a seat the waiter came a little after and she was very rushed she asked us what we wanted to drink and she spoke very fast and didn't even let us properly choose. Little after the waiter switch tables and the 2nd waiter was very pleasant. Not very pleased on what we order which was a Puerto Pensaco deep dish Nasty nasty Nasty nasty didn't even have carne on it also it was full of cilantro."}
{"text":"It shouldn't take over an hour to make a pizza especially if it's a take out order on a Wednesday. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"We visited this location with high hopes.  They have many locations so they must be doing something right.  Seeing reviews of long wait times to be seated and poor service mean nothing to me.  It's a new joint, give it time.  The food was OK.   We got there just after 3 pm on a weekday and there was no wait.   I ordered the Stuffed Riga Tony; my partner ordered the Roasted Chicken Garlic Lasagna.  I did not see one morsel of meat in my spicy \"meat\" sauce.  I picked through it with the fork and it was just chunks of tomatoes.  They must have used the wrong sauce.  The stuffed pasta was good, but not enough sauce.  The lasagna was a surprise because we saw a picture of it before we went and it was the traditional lasagne with 3 or 4 layers.   It is only one, maybe two layers.   It was covered with sauce but it was not your typical lasagne.  It was tasty, but there wasn't much more than noodles and sauce.  I am a garlic lover and could not taste the garlic.    I'll stick with Olive Garden for a while until this place survives all the reviews they will get from us old people in the area.  It's a little more expensive, but the descriptions on the menus are accurate.  

As we were leaving, a man came in, saw the line that had formed and asked for a to-go menu.  The girl said they ran out.  I can understand that, but there is a way to pull it up on line if you go to the regular menu, click on something like \"pasta\" and go to the bottom.  It gives you the option to download the to-go menu.  If I were running the place I would have told him that rather than lose a customer.   Or, send someone to another store and grab a few.  The guy just walked out mad."}
{"text":"Nice Pizza! Only thing I want to advise is the waiting time. It can take up to 45 mins before your meal gets served. Pan pizza and thin crust they both are good. Salad is good I liked it."}
{"text":"Love oreganos!! Definitely don't like wait times and once, we went there, sat outside during a windstorm and the waitress didn't even come by to give us new drinks, let alone come by for about 15 minutes, but the manager ended up giving us our appetizers for free and handled it professionally and with integrity, good place to eat, quality food, always go back"}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than the Big Rig with the shaved chicken.  I always take out of town guests to this place.  The music is REALLY loud there, which makes conversation difficult.  They need more locations so there isn't such a long wait!"}
{"text":"This location is just okay.  Prefer the Tempe location above all. The staff is really slow and had to request refills again and again then after sitting for thirty minutes track down the bill since the waitress was talking.  Won't return for service but food was okay"}
{"text":"Oregano's runs hot and cold in my book. I've had great meals here (pizza, mostly), but I've also had a fair share of bland pastas and not-so-spectacular sandwiches. 

I keep coming back, however, because it's a fun, friendly place. I'm a big fan of their quirky shirts (today's read \"legalize marinara\"), and the servers are always smiling as they go about their business. Most everyone goes out of the way to make sure you're having a good experience (today, for instance, I was promised a donation of dozens of empty cans for the school at which I work). 

I'll be back, and I'm hoping to try the deep dish pizza soon."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. I can't wait to eat the leftovers. My only complaint is from the time we got their till the time we ate was 2 hours. Thats a long time with 2 kids and waiting in the heat! Next time we are going to try take out."}
{"text":"I dont get why people wait hours to eat here.The food is average at best.It is also kinda pricey.The restaurant is so small that you're packed in there like sardines. I literally felt claustrophobic eating there.There is always a wait of 1 to 2 hours even during the day.Food takes forever, like an hr wait after ordering.Also the restaurant seems to be badly managed.Ie, rude hostesses, one server with too many tables to handle, while other servers are standing around looking bored.the pizza is pretty bland too."}
{"text":"Another great Oregano's opened in the valley.  This might be my favorite Oregano's yet.  Great decor, and a fun motorcycle inside.   The restaurant even features a separate motorcycle parking lot in rear.  Great food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This has been our favorite \"go to\" restaurant, especially since we moved to Paradise Valley 5 minutes away, 15 years ago. The food here is extensive and extremely good. Portions are huge and we can always rely on excellent food. I don't know how they find such nice employees. Almost hard to find anyone not smiling all the time. Just one more thing. My wife and I would like to personally thank the owner, Mark Russell for FINALLY changing the music to a milder Pandora station. For years it's been a continuous loop of the same loud Italian music over and over. We could tell how long we've been here by the song that was playing. All the employees are ecstatic, also. Now our favorite restaurant is PERFECT!!!  Thank you, Mark
The Regulars"}
{"text":"If I wasn't so hungry after a crowded long wait on a Friday night. I would say the Chicken Artichoke lasagna is , super delish! It still is. I guess this place is popular for a reason and don't forget the warm gooey pizzookie for dessert. Yum!"}
{"text":"WINGS OF GOLD!!!!
I feel that this is all that I have to say about thos place...but I won't.

You must trying the wings of gold. They are these like honey mustard wings that are perfectly fried and covered in the sauce. Some times I think that they use big chicken for their wings cause they are that big. 
If you go during lunch you can get pizza and a drink for a pretty good price. Their pizza is pretty tasty too. 
Don't like pizza, they also have pasta. The big rig pasta which is one of my farovites. Laso the cheesy garlic bread is MMMMM good too. 
I always come back to this place, mainly for the wings but for everything"}
{"text":"Service personnel are incredibly polite and always smiling. The food is above average and the biscotti was fantastic. The amount of food was such that there is always some left over to tomorrow's lunch. The interior could use a bit of sprucing up as it is showing its age. Very family friendly, though the music competed with conversation. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and I would return when in the area."}
{"text":"Great place with great pasta! I love the big rig with chicken it never disappoints"}
{"text":"Just went here with a group of friends. Food was good actually, but the service and experience was one I have never experienced and do not want to experience again. 

We ordered ONE round of beers and before our pizza even came out we were told that we were going to be refused to order any more drinks. The waiter came up and told us this without us even attempting to order anything more. We were not rowdy, we were not warned about anything, and we were not given any specifics as to why we were being \"cut off\" before we even attempted to order any more drinks. 

When we brought this to the manager's attention and asked for specifics and a real explanation, she was rude, not helpful, and really didn't seem to care about our experience. I think her name was Cher. 

Cher eventually offered to give us a discount of 20%, but then conveniently added a 20% gratuity to our bill. We were a group of 5. Funny how that actually took money out of the company's pocket and put it right into the pockets of the unprofessional employees. She refused to take this tip off our tab and we happily left the establishment.

I would not recommend this place to anyone for any reason. I would rather eat bad pizza with nice people than good pizza with rude people."}
{"text":"I have to say I love this place. Just not this location.  The other locations are set up for you to wait and drink and maybe even have an app to pass the time.  NOT this one.  There is no outside service of any kind, no water, wine, apps, or hostess looking for you if your not in their eye line.  So if you waited an hour and some of your party is over at home depot or something  passing the time they will not seat you. AND if you are not on the very small patio or 4 seat bar they will not look for you.  No restaurant pager or anything.  Pretty weird for a place that has a regular hour or two wait.  

I will drive to another location in the future, this one is just not set up correctly for the amount of people in the arrowhead area that go out to eat. Good thing I'm committed to my beloved 1554 beer !!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here after 8 months of living in Scottsdale. Countless friends have recommended this place and finally I can join the masses.  From the friendly service to the impossible- to-finish portions I am in love! 

Pause... 

I had to take another bight of the deep dish crust.

So good... so darn good..."}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of Oregano's in the past, but today i went there for lunch and tried their Pablo picasso salad. the chicken was so dry and the lettuce i think they forgot to dry off the water because it was swimming in its own pool of juices. Not that big of a deal. Nobody's perfect all the time. i sent it back and the manager came over and asked if i wanted something different since i did not like the salad (started out very nice) i really wanted that salad. he informed me that this is the way the salad comes and if i did not like it to get something else, and better yet eat somewhere else. i was in a state of shock for a moment and took the advise of going somewhere else. I will go back to Oregano's just not the Old Town location."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Oregano's. I've had their pizza a bunch of times but on my recent visit I had the Oregano's Favorite Salad which has sundried tomatoes, feta, roasted red peppers, pine nuts and red onions in it. LOVE it.  The Bistro Classic pizza is my favorite -- it's a white pizza with tomatoes, basil, and four cheeses on a super thin crust. YUM. I had to finish my meal off with the much talked about pizza cookie. It was RIDICULOUS. Don't leave without trying it. Trust me."}
{"text":"Had the Big Bruschetta Authentico which was unevenly toasted (blackened on one end and pale on the other) and soggy on the pale end.  The tomato, basil, red onion and garlic mixture was tasty.

My entree was the Italian Flag Lasagna and it was awesome.  Packed with meat and baked cheese goodness.  The accompanying garlic bread tasted a little sour.  It had fresh garlic on it, but I suspect it also had some garlic salt.  The bread part was okay.  Definitely beats the cookie-cutter Italian restaurant bottomless breadsticks.  

The wait staff was friendly and attentive without being annoying."}
{"text":"Ok first off I would like to say I've been to the one on Scottsdale Rd and was super satisfied, therefore my expectations may have been high already. With that said, my boyfriend and i ordered to-go and everything was absolutely perfect till we sat down to eat. It was soooooo...ICKY, for lack of better words. We ordered the calamari, Alfredo the dark, and the bbq pizza. The calamari tasted like it had been fried in bad dirty oil, the pasta was just pretty much tasteless.....like REALLY tasteless, and the thin crust pizza was soggy and had way too much oregano or parsley or whatever that herb crap was that was DUMPED on top. Needless to say, i don't permit myself to eat a ton of carbs so when i do get that ONE DAY A WEEK, I hope for it to be phenomenal but will settle for edible.....and that stuff was not.




Ok so since my rating of one star, I have decided to go back and change my opinion and here is why. About two days after my post, the manager contacted me via email in an attempt to make it right. I don't see myself taking him up on his offer ( a gift card to Oregano's) but the fact he expressed concern and legitimately wanted to fix the problem says alot about their willingness to correct any mishap you may have.  Sooooo with that said i give them three stars, not the best food but great customer relations."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this as I am a lover of Oregano's. However, my visit this morning at 11:00AM 12/30/13 was less than stellar. We arrived when the restaurant first opened and there was an OVERWELMINGLY strong smell of disinfectant cleaner once you entered the building. We noticed wait staff cleaning upon our entry. Prior to entering the building while walking to the entrance there as a huge puddle of water on the sidewalk/ parking lot on the east side of the building just north of the entry that smelled like someone had just rinsed out all the garbage cans. 

The reason I am writing this is it is now 1:45PM and I am experiencing a burning of my eyes from what I can only dissect as the residual effect from the strong disinfectant cleaner we experienced in the restaurant. I called the person I went with to see if she was have the same experience and it was confirmed.

This is a new location and I might suggest that they rethink the strength of the cleaner they use and the time they use it, not minutes before they open the doors. Also they need to seriously reconfigure where they wash out there garbage cans or whatever that stank puddle came from, (the access gate on the east side of the building and just north of the entry way). That is only going to get much worse with the summer heat!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the wait is ridiculous. Even for pasta and a sandwich it took 35 minutes. They even put on the menu that pizza will take 45 minutes. Service was ok. They can't provide enough soda for the poor starving masses waiting for the food but they try. When it got there the fiod was good...
The stuffed mushrooms a bit wierd but flavorful and the sauce on the pasta full of meat and cheese. Would go back but need a snack before we go."}
{"text":"What more can I say about Oregano's other than HUGE PORTIONS. I seriously never leave this place without leftovers. 

I'm talking garlic bread, pizza, pasta, sandwiches and great caesar salads to name a few. Most locations are slammed busy and you can expect a wait, but I've had good luck every time I've been to this location.

Parking can be a little weird since this is place is tucked in between saketini and a gas station."}
{"text":"Went tonight for dinner and had the most amaizng time eating thanks to the service will make sure to ask for Kaylee again she made me feel welcomed, personal and was very knowledgeable about the menu and she went through the menu to show us the popular items and her favorite items! We definitely will be back! Food was delicious with good prices and portioins.. My new favorite spot!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the margherita (sp?) pizza which was fabulous. We also ordered the brushetta since we were told the pizza would take about 20-30 minutes to make (which is typical). Both the pizza and brushetta were fresh and yummy. We sat indoors since I'm preggo and dealing with the heat didn't sound like fun. They have a small indoor area (like 4-5 tables) and a bigger outdoor area in the back. Prices were reasonable for this kind of food and ambiance; we paid $22 for the appetizer and pizza for two, no drinks (just can't justify spending $2+ on a drink that costs me less than that to buy at the grocery store, lol). We didn't have that gross-too-full-feeling afterwards which was nice since we walked around afterwards. A must eat at place!"}
{"text":"Best chicken wings on University...
nah..  best chicken wings in Tempe...
nah... best chicken wings in Arizona...
nah... best chicken wings in the States...

When it comes to chicken wings, Oreganos stands on top with Duffs (Buffalo, NY) and Wings around the world (Chicago, IL). Try the medium wings with a side of their hot sauce and blue cheese. Cool it off with a pizza cookie dessert."}
{"text":"My neighbor took me here for my bday the other day...it was Tuesday evening and we had to wait 20-25 minutes - I don't know the last time I've been to a restaurant and waited since I tried to avoid that, HOWEVER it was worth the wait.  Because i loved the dessert so much, let's start with that!

Of course, as it's been mentioned before, dessert is the cookie - ooey gooey half baked cookie dough (we chose the classic chocolate chip) with 2 scoops of ice cream. Yummy yummy heavenly orgasm!  I like dessert and i like cookies and this was just delicious. I wish there was a way to get this to go so I could eat it in the privacy of my own home - the things I would do to that cookie pizza :) ok, really I'd probably eat the whole thing in 2 minutes and let my stomach bloat like it never has before. not so sexy, huh?

the CUSTOMER SERVICE was AWESOME. From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered (there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same, don't know which one) all were pleasant, nice, helpful. I really don't know that I've ever gotten better service.

On to the main attraction....we got the O'Riva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had, but would i go back, definitley, would i order the same pizza, you bet. Would i try something else though, yep. 

Great atmosphere, great employees, great food.

Oh, can't believe i almost forgot...the alcohol! My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin (not the intent of the drink, just the effect). Would probably try a different drink - the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste."}
{"text":"SALTY...My husband and I came hear after hearing about this place. We were dissapointed with our appetizer and our dishes. We had to send our appetizer back due to how salty it was. Seating is tight and atmosphere is average. We would spend our money at Olive Garden before this place any day."}
{"text":"This location is my favorite... Not sure why... But it just is.... Love the chicken Alfredo after dark pasta!"}
{"text":"This is one of the true Arizona restaurants, and I recommend this place to anyone from out of town. Well, anyone in town too. The staff is extremely fun and nice, which is hard to come by these days.  The food is awesome. gigantic portions, but all the better to take home and enjoy the next day (or two...). The pizza and salads are my favorite, and of course one cannot forget the glutenous wonder of the pizza cookie (formerly the pzookie). This brings ooey gooey goodness to a whole new level. 

The only downside... Its size, but that is part of their schtick. Get there early, whether it is lunch or dinner or expect to wait a long time. Trust me though, it is well worth it. Oh and parking sucks too. Again the food and service are worth it the inconvenience.

**All the locations are great, the mesa one (one of the newest locations) is probably the worst, but I say that with a grain of salt. It is still better than most of the restaurants out there."}

{"text":"This was about my six visit. I love the thin crust pizza with toppings of sausage and basil. Of course, I must have the calamari appetizer.
Our waiter was so friendly and attentive. Oregano's is one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"In general, I do like Oregano's, and would give the chain as a whole 3.5 stars. However, the one time I tried this location, the service was pretty bad, it took forever for our food to come (when the place wasn't even that crowded), and when things came out wrong, neither our server nor the manager were very apologetic...in fact, they could have cared less. The Oregano's Favorite salad was delicious, as usual. The pizzas were just okay. I like the Scottsdale locations much better."}
{"text":"This location rocks! The staff is friendly and happy to be at work. 
I have probably eaten at 45 times and have never had a bad experience. The food is great as is the value!"}
{"text":"Nothing like a refreshing Bellini on a hot day....YUMMY!  Always a great place to come.  Got a thin crust pizza today.  Hit the spot. Lindsay was our Bartendar.  She was great as always!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Oregano's when I was visiting a friend in Phoenix. I had looked online to find what was considered one of the best pizza joints in Phoenix and kept seeing Oregano's pop up on lists. So we went. I remember we had a pizza and a pizzookie. Both were good. The pizza was tasty but the pizzookie was spectacular! I only recently discovered that Pizzeria Uno in St Louis has a similar dessert on their menu- thank god!
Btw, Phoenix was lovely in general!"}
{"text":"Was in Gilbert for a festival they are building an Oreganos in Surprise Az where I live and wanted to give it a try The service was great and the Big rig pasta with sausage was OMG delicious  Can't wait for the Surprise location to open as it is a walk to my house"}
{"text":"Oreganos has it all The food was outstanding ,our service was perfect and everyone made you feel welcome  We live in Surprise Az and cant wait for the new Oreganos to open . Thanks to Moe tha manager for providing us a great dining experience

{"text":"Great food. Huge portions. Never EVER leave this place hungry. Salads, pizzas, pastas all top notch. Always expect a long wait, sometimes a VERY LONG wait, unless you get there at an off hour tho. Worth waiting for me regardless. Take out is a good option to skip the lines as well."}
{"text":"Great pizza taste like Chicago... Service is outstanding Be sure to ask got Tony he is as authentic as Chicago comes... You will have to wait for the good to come to your table as Chicago pan takes longer.., but you know that if from Chicago...  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Giving 3 stars only because the food was good. Service was horrible. Split a salad and pasta and they brought out bowls for the salad but nothing for the pasta... The guy who dropped off the food asked if we were splitting and we said yes, assuming he's going to get us plates. Waited a good five minutes to ask our server or anyone who walked by but no one did. Used the small side plates that were on the table because he wasn't seen for at least 20 minutes! Not even exaggerating!"}
{"text":"Always a fun place to go to for a pizza cookie, salad, pizza, etc. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"From the northern Illinois area so I am used to amazing Chicago style pizza. My wife and I tried many places in the east valley. We  just couldn' find that perfect pizza we were used to.
Then one night we decided to order from here after driving by and reading the reviews. Let's just say we now order once a week and dine in on occasion. To sum it up, the best pizza and Italian food I have eaten in many years!! Truly authentic food with exceptional service! We found that amazing Italian food we've been looking for. Keep in mind, this place is always busy and you might have to wait a little extra for your food, but it is sooooo worth it!!"}
{"text":"love this place!! Pizza is super thin and tasty! Pasta dishes are awesome and well priced! Often there is a wait to get in, but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Cute location, nice staff. Brussels sprout side was definitely a highlight. Food was decent, nothing spectacular but good. The pizza we had (número-one) was very thin crust but not in the way a normal thin pizza is - it was difficult to pick up. We'd go back but it's not at the top of our list."}
{"text":"Service was horribly slow. Our food took over 30 minutes. Asked to speak to a manger. He came over and offered no sort of apology, just stated that he'd check on the food and then follow up with us later. Food came out and was just ok. Manger never came back by.  We waited 35 minutes for a table and were disappointed by our experience. Definitely will not be back, and will tell others not to waste their time."}
{"text":"Since we moved to Arizona a year ago, one of our family traditions is to eat at Oregano's on Fridays. Great tasting thin crust pizza.  Their salads are to die for (size and the tasting). I always enjoyed how cold the beer are each time I order one. The waiters always welcome us with a smile and makes us feel at home."}
{"text":"Extremely long wait to be seated.  Another extremely long wait after order was placed.  Dinner arrived 45 minutes after we were told it was coming right out.  Toilet in ladies room backed up and would not flush.  Dining room unbelievably noisy.  Will not go back to this location. Last, but not least, short pour on the wine!"}

{"text":"I just moved to the west coast and I've had oreganos recommended to me by a few different people. I was excited to give it a shot. Unfortunately I was far from impressed. I ordered a stuffed crust pizza which was literally pure cheese and dry crust. My friend got the deep dish which she couldn't even eat she said it was so undercooked, the pizzas took 45 minutes so we decided to order a salad, it was soaked and pure dressing. the drinks were good but the pizza ended up costing us 20$ each and we ate a slice each. Very disappointed and Won't go back. Wouldn't recommend it"}
{"text":"Oreganos is a fantastic place to get pizza, salad, wings, salad, and pasta..... Pretty much everything on their menu is delightful, and they also give hefty portions! I'd recommend getting the junior sized salads, the larger sized one is insane! The pizza is also delicious. All the favors mix perfectly no matter what topping, and the cheese is excellent! Always make sure they put on some freshly shredded Parmesan on your pizza.
 
The music choice is a little weird. Christmas music was playing, in September! Also, the decorations are a little bland as well. Christmas lights are wrapped around surf boards, and half of the lights don't even work!! The small 12 inch TVs are put in high awkward spots, but it doesn't matter because they're usually playing old black and white TV shows. 

Overall though I'd recommend Oreganos. Delicious good and great service, and I will be coming back"}
{"text":"Our waitress Cydney was awesome.  Always there with a refill and a smile.  The Southwest Salad is amazing and the chocolate chip pizza dessert is a must have."}
{"text":"Our first time there and our server, DON, was the best!! Made us feel at home, explained the menu, and took above and beyond care of us!  Food was above excellent and the atmosphere was fun and relaxed. Huge portions of food with just the right spice. But the best part was our server, Don. He put us in a great mood and made the dining experience perfect!  Will def come again and bring friends and family :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Our waitress Kristi was the worst waitress I have ever encountered. She spent most of her time standing beside the table next to us talking to her friends. She walked by our table numerous times while ignoring us and then would immediately go back to the table next to us to talk to her friends about her new job, how the days fly by, when she will know her next week schedule, (which is Saturday apparently) her personal life, etc. She wasn't polite whatsoever. My wifes salad (main entree) came out about 10 minutes after my sandwich and my son's food. I sat around waiting for her salad to arrive so I wasn't eating without her while my sandwich got cold. My wife called the restaurant later on to express her frustration to Mike \"the manager\" and he could really care less. It was obvious he wasn't listening to what my wife had to say and just wanted to get off the phone. I have been in retail management myself for over 10 years and that is not how you treat a customer with a concern or handle a customer service issue. This was my 1st visit to an Oreganos restaurant and it will definitely be my last."}
{"text":"Quality food, the Pablo Picasso salad is great and the pizza is fantastic.  There is no rhyme or reason as to the timing of bringing out food or drinks but you don't come here for great service just good food for the price point."}
{"text":"This is the place for me when it comes to Italian food.  My favored are deep dish pizza, and Alfredo the dark.  The food is very rich, flavorful and filling.  The ambiance is a little on the noisy side inside but nice outside in the fall or spring.   The only flaw I can find is that it might take a while to order but I've alway forget about this once I'm started eating.  I also recommend coming early if you want lunch because the line can be long sometime and some menu items are limited in quantity."}
{"text":"So much food! We had the calamari and Brussels sprouts to start. Then pizza and pasta. Everyone enjoyed their food. Server was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Generally my mornings consist of hitting the snooze button at least 5 times.  Getting out of bed is a difficult thing for me to do.  But remember being a kid? When there were those select days that getting out of bed wasnt hard?  First day of school, Christmas morning, Tuesdays and Thursdays during the summer when the hot neighbor would do her swimming and sunbathing before work... ahh, those were the days.  

Tomorrow will be one of those days when i dash out of bed... why? Because by noon, i will be at Oreganos stuffing my face with a Veggie Wedgie & Sweet Potato fries.  As a grown up, It's the little things in life that get me out of bed.  (Though, that swimming & sunbathing MILF might also still do it too.)

I've never had the pizza at Oregano's... in fact, since i have had the Veggie Wedgie, I may never have anything else at Oregano's.  Thanks to you, sweet Wedgie of the Veg... i will sleep with visions of sugarplums... no wait... eggplant, goat cheese, roma tomatoes, spinach, portobellos and feta.  Ahhh... i'm looking forward to you already.   Zzzzzzz."}
{"text":"I am sorry for rating this location so low because the food is excellent but if you can never get in to eat the food then what is the point? So first problem is that the wait time has been anywhere from 45min to 1.5 hours!? What?! How is it possible that you have that long of wait time? Oh and should you want order take out because you think \" hey take out should be quicker, right? RGHT? NO!!!! They have scheduled pick up times that rival their wait times, I mean I order at 6:30 and can't pick it up til 8:15?!! Ridiculous!! The only reason I don't give this place a one is because the food is good but the lack of options to obtain the food leaves something to be strongly desired...this location is so close to my house but I go to the Gilbert location because it takes less time to get food from there.  I really hope this oregano's can live up to the oregano's name because their food is awesome and hopefully they can improve their times of getting their customers through their restaurant."}
{"text":"We just had supper there, ordered the deep dish pizza and it was incredible! Our server was very attentive and informative, would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I just got home from my birthday dinner at Oregano's on Shea and Scottsdale Road.  I must say it was the worst food I have had in a long time.

I ordered the calamari appetizer and it was so salty I could hardly eat it.  I had also ordered the coop de ville jumbo chicken parm.

THE COOP DE VILLE JUMBO CHICK PARM
Hungry? We'll fill your tank with a great American classic! This model rolls off our assembly line and into your stomach with a HUGE all natural chicken breast served on a bed of fettuccine and topped with our homemade marinara, provolone and our four cheese blend. It's a real thrill ride. Hop in!


The huge all natural chicken breast was a piece of flattened breaded chicken breast that was over cooked almost burnt and again so salty I could not eat it.  Everyone at the table agreed that the calamari and my so called huge natural chicken breast were beyond too salty, it was inedible.  I told the waitress who wanted to get me another one, but by that time I was so off the food, I couldn't wait to get out of there.

Also, my sons ordered pizza that was so salty one of my sons could not eat that either.

She did not take that into account when giving us the bill.  Both of my sons have worked in food services and were amazed at the lack of quality and the lack of compensation for food that was unfit to eat.
  
Seriously, you can always add salt - you can never take it away.  What is with the cook at this location that the food is so bad?

Needless to say I would not go there again.  It was a disaster of a birthday dinner, to say the least.

This is the letter i just emailed to the corporate office.  This used to be a good meal, but not so much anymore."}

{"text":"The atmosphere was casual and fun. Both Indoor and outdoor seating was nice. Told the wait would be five minutes and that's what it was. Had the Dirty Monkey rum and fruit drink and enjoyed it. The pizza was very good and filling. Service was a tad slow but due more to the restaurant being busy as our waitress was working hard. I would go back again"}
{"text":"There pizza is some of the best around, when I think of a sit in pizza place i think of them! I have yet to have a bad pizza I will say sometimes the service is slow due to them being busy. I have had there wings and they are average nothing amazing but deep dish pizza and there cheese bread will make your mouth water!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the deep dish pizza. The server said it would be 45 minutes. So we waited and ordered drinks.Long Island Iced Teas best I've ever had so we had another. We had ubered here so when the waiter asked if we'd like another drink we said yes. That's when the manager came and yelled at us that we were only allowed two premium drinks. We were totally embarrassed. An hour later the pizza arrived. After the first bite I realized it was warm not hot. Being a chef I always have a thermometer in my purse. The temperature was 137 degrees. Obviously it's set in the window for quite a while to get to that temperature. The nasty manager did comp our pizza. So we left the server a 20 dollar tip. What we would have paid for the pizza and vowed never to return. I don't know what all the hype is about this restaurant. The food wasn't that good"}
{"text":"Group of three. Long wait, cold food, didn't get our order right, and my server didn't even check on us or give us refills. Definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"A week ago was the first time I've ever eaten at Oregano's Pizza Bistro. It was so good that I came back 3 days later... on a business lunch of course.

The environment is somewhat noisy when this place gets busy but it is also somewhat cozy. Italian items line the walls and the theme is well done.

The customer service was great, at lunch time and during busy dinner hours. The wait time for food wasn't too bad, maybe 20 minutes, but when the food comes out, it's all worth it.

The food is just so good. Not much else to say about it. I tried the thin crust meat pizza and it was very good. The second time I went I tried the Baked Pasta in a bread bowl. I could only eat half because there was so much food.

Great place to eat. Call ahead and check the wait times though, they get busy at night."}
{"text":"First time here at Oregano. We used the \"wait list\" on the Yelp app. 
We got our table immediately. We order a Julius Cesar salad to share & it was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the baked ziti and I ordered the Diablo shrimp pasta. Both dishes were very good!!  
We left very full and will return to Oregano next time we visit the area."}
{"text":"Favorite...best pizza ever...can't wait to go back. Its our Arizona tradition to visit oregano's. Tony is a true Italian from Chicago and obviously has a heart for deep dish with Italian sausage. We had the Portebella stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer this time.  We really enjoy the outdoor seating and the friendly service. When we get around to it, we will try one of their enormous and visually appealling salads. 6 stars! Also the jazzy tunes are a refreshing change of pace."}
{"text":"Hmm.. mixed emotions about this one. I was looking forward to a nice chewy gooey yummy mess of lasagna. If you just love spinach so much that you want the entire dish to be permeated with spinach flavor, then get the lasagna. Service was great and prices were reasonable - $9 per plate. The small ceasar salad had amazing dressing and was big enough to feed 3. Will return to try something else."}
{"text":"They're \"fresh handmade ravioli\" was frozen in the center. This place is full of shit"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum...

Let's start off with the service...our server was awesome. We had to wait quite some time before being seated and were starving. So she brought us some bread and butter to hold us over.

We started off with some wings. They are absolutely delicious here. My suggestion is to request a mix of the honey sauce and the medium sauce. It is finger-licking good. Literally.

On to the pizza. It was really good. Nice thin crust, baked to perfect crispy perfection. The toppings were fresh, and the amount of sauce was great. I hate getting a thin crust pizza with too much sauce. Soggy thin crust is an oxymoron to me. 

If you manage to have room, you HAVE to indulge in the baked cookie. You have the choice of peanut butter, macadamia nut or chocolate chip. OR you can do half and half. So worth the extra hour on the treadmill...

The only downside...the wait time can be long, especially on weekends. The upside to the downside, the servers do come by frequently to liquor you up and make the wait a little more bearable..."}
{"text":"Had the Chicago stuffed pizza and it was great!  Definitely worth waiting for.  We also shared a large dinner salad and it was really good and if you like spicy try the chipotle ranch dressing.  We sat outside and the weather was really nice and the tables were not too crowded together.  Our waiter was very attentive and brought sodas before we were finished as well as checking on us just enough to not be annoying.  Overall I would be a regular if I lived here but since I don't I'll just have to make a point of going every time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I ordered the stuffed riga tony and it was awesome. The stuffed ricotta cheese and the taste of herbs was definitely there. Oregano's Pizza Bistro thumbs up!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, decided not in the mood for such a long wait. I ordered pickup at 5:07 and he said would be ready at 6:15. Ok so still an hour but at least will be home waiting. Arrived at 6:15 to find out still not ready.   After 30 minutes more of waiting, at 6:45 was brought out. Pizza was fine. Diablo pasta was just terrible. Absolutely ridiculously mouth burning not taste just hot. There is a huge difference between a kick of flavor and taste bud suicide. I just at a bowl of captain crunch."}
{"text":"Haven't been to an oregano's in years. Decided to go and waited around 40-45 minutes for our food. Asked for a refill which took about another 20. Had our server come by twice to tell us our food would be right out and then continued to converse with coworkers the whole time. Finally my salad came out but my boyfriend had to wait for his. A manager never came by. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Come in every couple of weeks.  Food great and service usually good. Only complaint wait times even at just past 11 am on a weekday.  Waitress confused my wife when ordering $2.99 slice.  She had unknowingly switched her to a $15 pizza.  When brought out waitress refussed to change order and in snotty tone said that is what she ordered."}
{"text":"I've been to Oregano's a handful of times on this and other locations. The service and the food have always been good regardless of the location. And I the people who wrote the slogans and menu are geniuses. The only thing I that keeps Oregano's from getting five stars, is the fact they do not take reservations, and they will not seat your party until everyone is present. Seems a little silly not to able to have a drink while you're waiting for friends to show up."}
{"text":"What a delicious place! The pizza is always good and has a variety of options. Our favorites are the clark street (meat) pizza, carne asada and the rosemary potato. My family and I also had the Mexican salad(not the full name) but it was very yummy! Thank you for such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Diablo Shrimp.....AMAZING!! Excellent service, and extremely friendly staff. Definitely a place i'd go back to."}
{"text":"Kinzer was an amazing server!!! Fast and efficient!!!! Hands down best serves I've had!!!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Oregano's!  I've had a great experiences at all Oregano's around the valley and this one is no exception.  Awesome food, good portions, staff has been friendly.  I think the atmosphere is second to none!  Love the patios, misters, fireplace - you name it they have it.  Highly recommend it to all my friends!"}
{"text":"This place is great, especially if you're looking for a fun sit down restaurant. The pasta looked great but we opted for pizza. The thin crust pizza was tasty and so was the stuffed artichoke appetizer but the kicker was the peanut butter pizookie dessert. It was freaking awesome!! The service is great and very friendly and we really enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"It took me a few years to get to Oragano's because I'm not a big Italian food fan--normally I'd rather  make it myself.  But now I get what the local hype is all about. The atmosphere is fun --but  WAY TOO LOUD--don't go the and expect to be able to hear each other--go there to eat their fresh homey-style food.  Salads are crispy fresh and I love the variety .The pizza surprised me--we got the thin crust--and it was by far the thinnest crust I've had anywhere--but it was tasteless and the toppings spare probably because the crust is so thin.   We'll try a thicker crust next time. The  pastas are wonderful and that half-baked cookie with ice cream should be outlawed--post haste. I do not even what to know the calorie content. But I will get it again. We've fallen in love with with the place."}
{"text":"My family and I love the Bowl-O-Pastas! Super easy, delicious, and filling. We always have leftovers. The service was extremely attentive and accomadting for a busy Saturday night. Love coming here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in the valley!! Love all the pizzas I've had here and the big rig pasta is a favourite and works like a charm Everytime. The wait can sometimes be long but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and service. We order half of the ol mexigano pizza and and half of numero one-o pizza. Tasty pizza after long drive from Calif."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I decided to stop in for lunch today. We were seated right away by the friendly staff in the front as we walked in.  We were greeted right away by our awesome and friendly server Charlie.  He never stopped smiling the entire time we were there; he was really great!! We ordered off of the lunch menu and we were served within 30 minutes. My daughter was given a ball of pizza dough to play with while we waited for our food, she was so happy.  It was a great first visit to this location. Because of Charlie, the great food and good vibes, we'll definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I have to start with I love this place food is always delicious. I decided to do a review and explain my low rating. The last few visits I requested to sit in outdoor patio. The flies were so annoying not to mention ruined my appetite. This NEEDS to be addressed ASAP. I join friends here frequently but will have to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Orega doesn't Blow
By The Rue

What is it about this place,
That makes me want to stuff my face,
I don't even wait to say grace,
\"Tina eat the food\" without leaving a trace.

Let me drop onto you some widsom,
From the top of my intellectual prism,
Oregano's has never gotten my criticism,
Much like the Dewey Decimal System. 

Anything you order you can't go wrong,
Whether you're sober or baked like Chong,
If you go with me please wear a thong,
I think I'll turn this review into a song.

Vino Bambino salad or antipasto,
Try either one or the Pablo Picaso,
I'll bet you're from the town of Madesto,
I say \"abra cadabra\" and presto!!

{"text":"I absolute love this place! The best food and even better service. I have been here dozens of times but this experience was the best one because of our waiter, Sullivan (aka Sully) . He was so attentive and incredibly personable. I'm definitely coming back here soon just for his awesome service!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to the restaurant.  We heard great reports.  Our party of four ordered four different pasta dishes.  All four were very good.  Service was great.  We plan on returning in the future!"}
{"text":"We love Oregano's. There is usually always a wait to be seated and a wait for the deliciousness. However, the wait it always worth it. We have three little kids and have had to find creative ways to entertain them while we wait. They are always given a piece of dough to play with, and there is lots for the kids to look at. They are very family friendly, but it seems everyone there is having a great time even without kids. This is a local spot that I always bring visitors to, and tell everyone to try."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and huge portions so there's always left overs! My favorite is the Alfredo the Dark or the Big Rig, I tried the El Diablo shrimp pasta but was disappointed! It's very spicy which I like but not nearly as good as their other pastas! Wouldn't recommend that dish, other than that their food is always my go to. End your meal with a pizookie to top it off, their delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible place. Went here the other night on a Tuesday around 7 pm and they said it would be a 20 minute wait and it was over an hour. When we finally got our take it took forever to get the food. My mom s salad had some sort of hair out string in it and my dad's dinner was wrong.   

Not sure of this I'd the norm for this place but we are never going back"}
{"text":"I had Oregano's for lunch Saturday, by myself, at the bar. :( Whoa is me!! Just kidding. Had an hour to kill so I stopped by here to grab a VINO BAMBINO, yo!! The best thing on their menu in my opinion. Really though, I've had just about everything on their menu and I always get the Vino Bambino. (Or the Pablo Picasso). These salads rule. Split one with your friend or just get the large all by itself. You won't be sorry. Oh and happy birthday to the bartender who was tending Saturday morning 4-14-2012. I love the view in this place. I want to marry every female server in the joint!!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! My husband and I always pass by this Oregano's on Camelback and never tried it until recently. We arrived on a Friday night and it was crazy. There was. 45 minute wait but we got lucky and found a spot at the bar. The inside is very eclectic and warm, and we were greeted multiple times from everyone there. We perused the menu and decided to try their deep dish pizza (which they warned us ahead of time would take 40-50 minutes to make) so in the meantime we got the deep fried ravioli with jalapeño cheese and it was very good! We also got 2 almost 24oz beers to go with it and the price was decent for those. We finally got our pizza and it was delicious! We were a little wary of the price but since it's deep dish, you pretty much take the rest home and have leftovers for the next 2 days so it's worth it! We will definitely be back and bring friends because you could easily get a meal for 4 people out of their servings."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Phoenix, period.  We love eating here and we've got it down to a science.  Here's your gameplan for a fantastic Oregano's experience in under 90 minutes.  Print it out and take it with you (yes, you can laminate it if you want).

INSIDER'S GUIDE TO OREGANO'S:

1) Make plans for dinner (lunch is an impossibility unless you have two-hour lunch breaks ... you lucky dog).

2) Get some fun friends together (Oregano's is great in groups of about six - keeps all seating options open)

3) Grab a deck of cards or two (you'll see)

4) Get the whole group to show up at 6 (they won't put your name on the list unless you're all there)

5) Hang out and talk or play cards with your friends for forty minutes or so (now you see why they need to be FUN friends)

6) About 20 minutes before your scheduled seating, order two things: DEEP DISH PIZZA and GUACA-TONY.  These both take a while but the waitstaff will put the order in and have it cook while you wait.

7) After you get seated and get drinks, put in any SALAD OR ENTREE orders.  As you do, the guaca-tony will show up right on cue.  Your friends will admire both your foresight and your appetizer selection.  It's an amazing Italian guacamole with a thin-crust pizza for dipping.  Unforgettable, as Old Blue-eyes would say.

8) The guaca-tony will be mostly gone in a hurry, so have the obligatory \"no, you take the last slice\" discussion, and reluctantly gobble down the rest of it (way to take one for the team, champ).  Just as the pan is cleared, here comes the pizza and other entrees.  Perfect!  But don't let that waiter escape - order your PIZZOOKIES now! (ideally chocolate chip, but I won't judge if you go for peanut butter or white chocolate macadamia nut).

9) Devour the pizza.  Their deep dish is so very good.  It's extremely filling, so it's best to calculate about 1-2 slices per person.  Don't worry, it's tasty reheated.

10) Just when you decide you can't eat another bite, the pizzookies show up ... and, well, you might as well have a little.  Generous scoops of vanilla ice cream on top of a half-baked cookie in a pizza pan, and drizzed with chocolate syrup.  The best.

11) Grab the check.  Your friends will think you are very generous, but it turns out eating at Oregano's is really affordable in groups, since you split most things.  Without alcohol, it usually works out to about $10 per person, including tax and tip.  Of course, you can just ask everyone for the 10 bucks or, if you're feeling unscrupulous, ask them all for 15 bucks.  For the awesome meal they just had, they'll probably pay it!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went in for lunch and had AJ as our waiter. I ordered my pasta forgetting to ask for no tomatoes...AJ was very courteous and understanding and had a new order out for me super fast even with it being lunch time and being as though it was my error. We had a great experience and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I love this place..nice friendly staff and foremost great food. I gotta stay away from carbs :)"}
{"text":"The Oreganos favorite salad with the chicken is always amazing! I could eat this every day.big Bergstrom is also great. Pizza and meatballs are my husbands favorite. Good variety, great service"}
{"text":"Been to Oreganos now twice in the last two weeks. Honestly some of the best service I've had in a long time and on both visits! The pastas have been nothing short of great! But the meatballs.....after hearing for a few years that they are \"the best in town\" and housemade. Of course I had to try them fort visit bland and the texture is that of almost a pate or consistency of cat food. Second visit gave them a try again and well they are the same. No visible garlic,onions or herbs just all ground together to a fine grind. I will continue to frequent them as I am impressed with every other aspect."}
{"text":"Oregeno's is a great place to go with the family or a large group and ingest like 4 million calories.
The artichoke dip, spinach salad, and pizzas are very good.  I'm still shaking my head at the fact that they don't have ricotta as a topping though!  Oh, the pizzokie is like another 1 million calories but it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Super impressed! Being from Chicago pizza has to be really good. This was such a delight! Great service! Awesome antipasti salad!"}
{"text":"So excited that they opened one at this location!
Any business in this building never stays very long - but I'm hoping Oregano's is here to stay! 
If it's anything like it's fellow locations - it will always be poppin'!

Thanks for the yummy food, excellent soundtrack and atmosphere as always!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Tasty, great staff.  Parking was a pain but it was worth it!  So much food you couldn't finish your meal even if you wanted to."}
{"text":"Awful awful service. I was visiting from Chicago and was excited to try Chicago pizza at this new, highly talked about restaurant. We didn't even get to experience the food because after waiting two hours (don't expect to get in in less than 1.5 hours any day of the week), and after another hour of waiting at the table our waiter told us they delivered our pizza to the wrong table (does this happen?). After waiting ANOTHER 45 minutes, it was almost 10pm and we were told that our pizza was poorly made and couldn't be served (um, what? isn't that your only job Oreganos?!). We spent a total of 3.5 hours at this restaurant without eating anything, especially not the \"renowned\" pizza, and left with a $50 gift card and will go unused because we're never going back. Thanks for ruining my last night in town, Oreganos, and leaving us totally perplexed as to what exactly happened. Save yourself an evening of frustration and eat somewhere, anywhere, else."}
{"text":"Hit and miss on how good the food is and the service. Got a plain cheese pizza and it was the worst I have ever had. The fried ravioli is better than their other locations."}
{"text":"I Love Love Love Oregano's.  When I lived abroad I was terribly homesick for this place and to be honest, the thought of living further than an hour's drive from Oregano's puts me into a panic.

The food is Delicious and Generous and the prices are SUPER reasonable.  The Alfredo the Dark with chicken is wonderful, and my staple.  I especially like the roasted poblano chile on top, which oddly varies in degrees of hotness depending on the day.  There was one time that I happily snarfed the pepper only to realize a minute later that my lips were ON FIRE.  Like, I had to ice them for the next 20 minutes.  Still, I take full responsibility for that silliness and recommend that everyone be Very Careful when eating those little guys.  The salads are great, the belinis are yummy- the staff is crazy friendly, which would usually annoy the hell out of me but I find it oddly endearing.  *sigh* I cannot wax poetic enough!"}
{"text":"I will forever be a fan... the food, the people that work there...the atmosphere...is just gooooooooooooooooooood.

My only gripe with this place is parking...not that is difficult, but if you are not familiar with the area...you will have a hard time finding some.  

My other only suggestion will be to open a location in Glendale..."}
{"text":"This Oregano's is great! 
Their dessert cookies are delicious, and their pizza is good too. 
I've gone here several times, its not always as good as you expect it, i guess it just depends on the dish. 
I recently got the Bistro Classic pizza and it's the best thing I've had there yet! I would definitely recommend it. 
Oh, and their just regular dinner salad is great too, especially with the Raspberry Vinaigrette. The Gorgonzola cheese they put on it can be a little strong, especially after you eat it for awhile but it gives the salad a nice touch. 
The Boom Dip is also a good appetizer. 

Hope my review is helpful."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delish! Stuffed mushrooms, pan pizza with pepperoni, green peppers and onions, garlic cheese bread, Caesar salad with what appeared to be homemade croutons. Sat outside on the patio. It was a warm balmy evening the day before Thanksgiving. Long wait for a table but service was good once seated. Been here twice and can't wait to visit again next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with Oregano's take out service!  I called at 4:15 on a Sunday and was told I could order at 5:45! This is insane!  Not like I am calling at a prime time!  We have called several times to be turned away.  I understand during dinner hour but not at 4 in the afternoon. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant in Scottsdale.  First went here in their old location in the 1990s. Food is still excellent and so is the service. Be sure you are hungry as the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Good pizza and pasta.  Gets busy at lunch, so not the best place for a large group of coworkers, but the food makes up for the wait."}
{"text":"My family has never been to Oregano's. I typically go there for work lunches. Everyone enjoyed the food and commented on how great the atmosphere was. I had the really big salad and realized that I would be taking half home. It honestly is a little too large. Great place to go for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Got the big slice which is just two slices together. Crusty underneath and piping hot. Perfect amount of pepperoni and cheese. Nice ambiance... music was playing but not overly loud. Server was exceedingly friendly. My wife got a chicken pasta dish (forgot the name) which was good but just a tad spicy. Even so, we will definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"When ever you're in Phoenix, Mesa, or Tempe Arizona this is a great place for some good food.  Chicken Alfredo!!'"}
{"text":"I ordered the Big Beefstro salad. It was spinach with not much beef. The onions on top not sure what they were but not tasty. This salad was $11! Maybe a few tomatoes and cucumbers would have been nice. Doubt I will order this again."}
{"text":"It's extraordinary pizza, either thin or thick crust doesn't matter. You will love this place. Brace yourself for a wait anytime of the day or night though."}
{"text":"Went at 1230 on Sunday for lunch.  Excellent service puts other restaurants in the area to shame.  Good food, good prices too."}
{"text":"Best restaurant. EVER

The food is so fricken good it's unbelievable.  Pablo Picasso salad as an appetizer.  Followed by the baked penne, which is served in a homemade crunchy bread bowl. Finished with a pazooki desert.

I could've eaten everything on the menu, but could only pick one entree, so guess what? Yes, I'll be back next week.

Heaven on earth."}
{"text":"Oh, Oreganos how I love thee, let me count the ways! Seriously, we only come here for special occasions, mainly birthdays, for a REASON: they are awesome! We always come with plenty of time on our hands because we know things take time, I'm cool with it and so is my family. But, the last time we were here it was my birthday and our waitress made it so special. I wish I could remember her name, but she was so cool with a pixi blonde hair 'do. She helped my vegetarian mom modify a dish that my mom really ended up liking. I got the Margherita Pizza well done and my god it was so, so, so good. I can't remember what my dad got, but he really liked it. And my guy got Lasagna and he loved it. Of course, I got the free birthday cookie thing and shared it with everyone, and THEN our SUPER COOL waitress brought us a mini Bellini for us all to share! My mom had never had one and she loved it! (It was STRONG too!). Anyway, I really love Oregano's, they go above and beyond and I've never had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"This is my goto place for lunch.  The pasta, sandwiches, salads and pizza are excellent.  The sizes are huge and guarantee you will be taking some of it home.  I have not had a bad experience with the food or the service.  The only complaint I have is the parking.  I don't know if it is intentional or just bad choices but the parking at most of the valley restaurants is horrible.  I know they opened some new locations that are attached to shops with large parking lots (Phoenix and Mesa) but the others almost require you to show up 15 prior to opening to find a spot."}
{"text":"Stopped by at 8:40 and the place is packed. Decide to try take out instead. Wait time for a meatball sub and a bowl of pasta is 2 hours!!!!  Must be training the cooks. :(

I love Oreganos but that is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Oregano's... my love affair with Oregano's is long. It started in Flagstaff (still my favorite location) and continues today.

This location  lacks a little of the joi de vivre of the Flag or south Scottsdale locations. However, the caliber of food is consistently high and makes up for whatever I imaginen I'm missing... There is a large patio, surrounded by (woefully inadequate amounts of) parking.  You can almost always expect a touch of waiting. 

However, whether you order the savory thin crust pizza, the warm and creamy Boom dip, a deep dish with goat cheese, herbs, onion and extra sauce, or just have dessert for dinner with an ooey gooey Pizzookie, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent but something is off about the food, maybe too salty. Still a fun place to eat."}
{"text":"We would give it 3 1/2 stars if we could since Oregano's is really better then your average pizza place but it's not quite Bianco's. The Chicago Thin Crust Pizza was a very good pie. Thin but not overly hard, the ingredients were fresh but a little salty. The service was great and the place decorated really fun and retro, you definitely knew you were having a pizza when you walk in."}
{"text":"From the friendly staff to the euphoric aroma that overwhelms you as you walk through the doors, Oreganos is a place where you immediately feel at home.  We started off with some toasted ravioli with marinara sauce. It had a little kick to it and was tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary. Then we moved on to the Italian wedding soup and antipasta salad. The soup was delicious and came with a small piece of yummy cheese bread. The salad was extraordinarily good with a ton of cured meats and artichokes. My father in law who is not a salad fan, loved it too!  Their buffalo wings are big and juicy, but not dripping with sauce (just the way I like it). We ordered the medium spice which had a nice and tang with a little heat that creeps up on us after we devoured our first piece.  We then had their midnight pasta and substituted fettuccine in place of their corkscrew pasta and chose shrimp as our protein. The dish came with a ton of delicious gigantic pieces of shrimp and the portion of the pasta could easily feed 4 people with all the salad and apps we got. Their thin crust pizza was delicious and crispy even in the center.  Needless to say, we had left overs and had no room for dessert. I will definitely be back here on our next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been to most of the Oregano's in town, over the years, since the beginning when they opened in the 90s. I'm going to review the Gilbert location, because I think it offers the best food, service and parking. Downside: more families (i.e. screaming kids) than let's say the Scottsdale/Tempe/Phoenix locations.

But I tell ya what, when I'm out in the country visiting relatives, I enjoy a stop at Gilbert Oregano's. It's what ALL Oregano's used to be. Consistent, with the best pizza in town and GREAT service. Sad to say, but the service has dropped off precipitously at the Camelback/Phoenix location, and is hit-or-miss at the Scottsdale/Shea location. Maybe since Gilbert is a more family-friendly atmosphere, the servers in the area are more....friendly. I dunno.

Oregano's has always had the best pizza in town, I think. Yeah yeah I'm a food snob too and I appreciate the \"real-ish\" Italian styles of the Bianco chefy pizzas. But to me, that is more of a fancy bread dish than a real slice of pizza. Pizza should be heavy, with a lot of sauce, cheese and fresh copious toppings. The meatballs are home-made on an Oregano's pizza. Respect for that. But I never understand their red \"jalapenos\". I think they call it \"jalapenos\" but really they're just assorted hot peppers. Still taste good; just confusing.

New York has thin crust, Chicago has deep dish, Arizona has Oregano's. It's the signature pizza in the state, from Flag to Tucson. Can I live without their sexual innuendo-heavy advertising? Do I think it's childish and not really funny at all? Well, just because they have lame marketing doesn't mean they don't do a good job of presentation at the ACTUAL restaurants. All are impeccably decorated (for the style they're going for) and all locations look the same, which is fine since it's a good look. ALMOST too much crap on the walls a la TGI Friday's or Chotchkies from \"Office Space\".

Love their huge parking lot next door. When parking is a breeze, I don't mind a longer wait for a table, as you will often find here. When service is top-notch, I don't mind a longer wait for a table. I think once, it was just-OK at Gilbert Oregano's, but more often than not it's great.

The pasta dishes and sandwiches are frequently tasty and desirable. Good meats, sauces and cheeses. However, the salads have always been a train wreck. Sorry, Charles, but you CAN'T serve iceberg lettuce salads anymore with RAW ONION in the year 2014.

The gross salads and long waits take Oregano's from 5 to 4-stars. But if you go at the right time and know what to order (the PIZZA!), this place is a state gem. Plain and simple."}
{"text":"went at about 3:30 wed trying to beat the crowd..only waited about 10 minutes,im glad we didn't wait longer because it definitely wasn't worth waiting for..my wife ordered shrimp scampi and had to send it back..the shrimp were tough as rubber..i had a 12\" pizza that was no big deal,it was nothing special at all..the place is very loud..if only the food was as good as the service!!
we wont be back..."}
{"text":"All around incredible dining experience. The staff were attentive, friendly and offered great suggestions. The wait once we ordered was 39 minutes, expected on a fresh baked pizza. You must try the thin crust Mediterranean pizza, it is the best."}
{"text":"Super good food!!!! I come once a week and I always get great service!!!! The food tastes extravagant the pesto penne bake is a favorite among the family!!! The workers are really nice but you can tell there is a sense of fakeness almost among the managers, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"had the chicago stuffed pizza with 2 items....paid $ 24.54.  

decent pizza but way over priced...


crust very dry...too much basil..."}
{"text":"I'm convinced that these ratings are low to discourage people from going, therefore reducing the outrageous wait times. Other than that, there is no reason to give this place any fewer than 5 stars. All of the food is excellent. The wings are among the best I've ever had and each sauce is unique and tasty. No time wasted with tiny winglets...it's all drumettes. 

The sausage sandwich is good and spicy, with cornmeal crusted waffle-fries and a side of marinara. The Vino Bambino salad is fresh and different with wine marinated chicken. And I haven't even mentioned the pizza! Thin crust or Chicago-style is available, but the thin crust is so good, we haven't even tried the Chicago. Saved room? The pizookie is sweet and gooey. 

The service is always fast and friendly, plus their shirts are funny. A great, casual atmosphere perfect for a delicious meal. Always a must stop when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My fav place to take my fam!
yes it gets busy sometimes but its always worth the wait. Staff is always friendly and on top of it. Kids love it cause I don't have to keep telling them to keepit down.It's pretty loud already cause it's so busy. Try the Big Rig Pasta with chicken you'll luv it."}
{"text":"Good place to stop and eat if you think you've tried every pizza place in town. If you are a real pizza fan get out of oreganos. Go to Grimaldis in Scottsdale or even better Pizzeria Bianco"}
{"text":"Would be 5 stars if they would turn the music down!  Food is great, service is great, love the misters on the patio...but the crappy loud jazz music is too much!"}
{"text":"We had a large group and the wait list worked like a charm. Our out of town guests love the atmosphere and food. Well done Oregano's team!"}
{"text":"Best place in Goodyear. Wait time is a little long but what do you expect. The food is Amazing. We were greated by Donnie the server. A great server who was informative and very funny. Its nice when you server hustles around. The food is outstanding. I had the stuffed rigatoni per our servers request and my wife had Alfredo with chicken. What made it was the staff. He made us feel like family. Will be back.. Glad Goodyear finally has great pizza. I had a chance to take the thin crust home."}
{"text":"Oregano's is a must when we come to Arizona. Service is awesome, food is awesome...everything is awesome! Be prepared to wait but they will sometimes serve pizza samples plus you can get drinks and appetizers while you wait!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is great, their pasta and red sauce is fantastic, the cheesy garlic bread is the best I've ever had, the portion are giant, and the staff is always courteous and competent. The patio seating is very nice during the cooler months. The only complaints are you usually have to wait 30 min to get a seat for dinner, and if you eat here very often you will quickly find yourself at least 10 lbs overweight."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best pizza's I've ever had.  However ...and a big However!  We called for a take out ... because it takes toooooo darn long to get into their restaurant..  We were told that it would take an hour for our pizza to be prepared.  We came to the restaurant after an hour ..and we had to wait another 45 mins!!!  No pizza is that good!  If you have 3 hours to go get pizza ... and nothing else to do, I'd recommend this place.  If you have a life ..and value your time, I'd say no.  Every once in a while I still go here, but .... only if it is 11:00am ...and I have time for a 2.5 hour lunch.  Not a place you can go to on a regular basis ...and still juggle a busy schedule"}
{"text":"I love this place. All the staff recognize when you return and make it feel like a mom and pop local bistro. The food is always great, the portions are great and the environment is really fun."}
{"text":"Very good pizza is huge tho 6 of us at and still had half a pizza left the wings are a must have!!"}
{"text":"Went here based off yelp reviews and it was delicious! Love that they give you dough to play with b4 your meal. The big rig pasta was spicy but great-add chicken. The thin pizza was fantastic. Waitress was lovely. Cookie pizza dessert also yummy.  Go!"}
{"text":"Here in Tempe visiting ASU. Wanted some quick and cheap Italian food, so my family and I decided to come to Oreganos. 

The service was great and the food was superb. I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo. It was rather different in that the sauce was mixed with jalapeños. My mom ordered the dinner salad and it was literally an entire garden in a bowl. IT WAS HUGE!! And only $4?!?! Wow! 

Anyways.. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"I suppose the food is good because this place is always packed with people.  I'm a huge fan of the chocolate chip cookie dough pizza with ice cream.  I just can't stand the long waits for everything, so I only go once every year or so.  The service is never fast."}
{"text":"My friend was visiting from Show Low, Arizona. We decided to try 'Oregano's', based upon my son's recommendation. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality and portions of the food, but most impressed with our server, Brianna! EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE! Always smiling and quick to anticipate and/or meet any needs we may have had.

I highly recommend this restaurant. Great for families or a date night. Ask for Brianna! You won't be disappointed!

Five stars!"}
{"text":"The food at Oreganos has never failed to be amazing. Wait times, are long, but it's always been my experience that the quality of the food being served is very high.

The service, I find, is hit or miss, depending on the luck of the draw, which it typical in any restaurant given the server that is assigned to the table at which uou were seated 

Overall, I think the atmosphere is fun and most everyone is having a good time"}
{"text":"Ok, so I haven't written a review in a short while but, this one is worth it! 

I love Oregano's. I do! And I haven't been in a while. But today I decided to go because my mother, who just moved here from Louisiana, thinks she's eaten at every restaurant there is since she's been here...she hasn't...so I decided to take her here since it's in walking distance (too cold tonight though). There was a line outside that looked like forever. But, we walked right to the bar and sat down. 

New menu! New Options. 

I order oldies: Stuffed Mushrooms and Pesto Pizza. The parental unit orders the new Kale salad (I don't do meat products, so I pass. Smelled/looked good though).

Everything was on point! Best of all...my two Top Shelf Cadillac Margaritas! Hand squeezed with homemade Sweet & Sour! Who does that? Not many, that's for sure. 1st one was made with lemon instead of lime. Tasty, real tasty! 2nd....had it made regular (with lime) but with a lemon wedge. Man! Those drinks were on POINT! 

Hands down to the manager over there! His menu suggestions were righteous and his rita's were the best I'd had in weeks!

Good food. Excellent service. And hearty portions. A little pricey...$85 dollars later, and worth every penny. But, hey! That's the price you pay for good food AND good service! Right?

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at this, or any other, Oregano's. They must be doing something right. The quality of the food is excellent and the staff is friendly and courteous. 

At first glance the prices seem a little high, but the portion sizes are huge! We usually have a meal for the next three days. 

I recommend mom's sausage and peppers, if you want pasta, or the big beefstro salad, if that's your thing, but honestly, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

I will agree with another reviewer that there is very little else besides pasta and pizza, but if you don't want a high carb meal, don't go to a restaurant that labels itself a \"pizza bistro\" or just about any Italian restaurant for that matter."}
{"text":"It was absolutely freezing in there. The pizza was undercooked and they forgot part of my daughters order. Best part was the chocolate chip bazooki!

Don't know if I would come back to this location"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.  Just love this place!  The pablo picasso salad, so good.  The Lawrence's Orignal thin crust pizza, yum.  Of course-the peanut butter pazookie is to die for.  Great waitress-just as good every time.  (I would kill for the recipe for the honey vinagarette on the Oreganos favorite salad)"}
{"text":"I love their avocado appetizer.  Easily share with 4 people.  The pie dough is crisp and sliced in triangles and delicious with the dip.  Also enjoy their their steak salad.  Can share that with a friend too.  I do not care for their pizza.  They call it Chicago style but believe me it is not!!!  I'm from Chicago and our pizza's are not spicy!!!!"}
{"text":"I've dined here about 20 times and I'm convinced you can't go wrong with any choice: salad, pizza, sandwich, pasta, etc... 
Portions are very generous and moderately price (not included the pizza)
Wait staff has always been great and the atmosphere is unmatched in the phoenix area.
Wine menu is a little weak but you don't go there for the wine.
Plan ahead because the wait can be lengthy.  Forget about calling in an order at 5 on a Sunday, it'll be 2 hours minimum.  Chicken Ceasar Pasta Salad togo is my fav, and at 5.89$ you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"My friend and I eat at Oregano's at least once a week. We began coming here in the spring and have tried most things on the menu. My friend is not well and we were delighted to meet Austin one evening. He always welcomes her by name, remembers her likes and dislikes in food, and makes her feel special. There have been times when we did not stay to eat if Austin was not working. We always call in and request seating in his area. We know the service will be excellent and we appreciate his attentiveness."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's, so this review is written with a heavy heart. My boyfriend and I went to the Tempe location and walked through a seemingly empty restaurant - we were both extremely hungry and thought that we could get a spot right away as they appeared \"dead.\" Stood behind an elderly woman waiting to be seated and was told by a very rude hostess that she couldn't be seated until her party arrived. Walked up right after and was told we had a 20 minute wait when there was nobody even eating or waiting. I could understand if the hostess had been thoughtful enough to apologize and say they were short-staffed as I am usually understanding with this type of situation, but she didn't so much as offer an apology. So, we went elsewhere. I'd suggest the Oregano's off of Dobson and Southern - much friendlier and faster service."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's.  It's hard not to love a restaurant that is able to recruit friendly staff, serve large portions at very reasonable prices, have good thin-crust AND deep-dish pizza, and offer an iconic dessert.  If you haven't been to an Oregano's yet, don't let the prices fool you; the portions are large.  So unless you're morbidly obese, be prepared to share your food family-style and still have some for leftovers."}
{"text":"I've have been to several Oreganos and by far this one is the best I've been to. The food as always was superb. I tried the Big Beefy Sandwich and after a slight mix up that was promptly fixed i enjoyed every overstuffed bite of it. The sweet potatoes fries, let me just say this place now holds the gold standard for them! Wow! My mouth is already watering just thinking about them. 

The food as stated was superb but what sets this place apart is the staff. From the manager down to the hostess we were well greeted and served. Even with the slight mix up food was prompt, hot, and tasty. 

Now the Giant Cookie....just get it and pay for the calories later. It is hot warm and gooey and the ice cream takes care of that burning sensation on your tongue. 

Thanks for a wonderful visit and I will be including this Oreganos on my next journey to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"When this existed it was... my favorite valley location of Oregano's.

***Now, I say just go to Flagstaff. Hee. It's a good excuse to get out of town.*** 

If it's a loooong wait, and you don't mind a little ambient noise go ahead and sit in the bar. You can usually sashay right in, grab a spot and be happily full in a fraction of the time it would take to get through the full restaurant experience.

However, if you have the time the patio is worth waiting for, and the little house full of tables is cozily warm and full of divine smells. 

I recommend trying the big ol' ravioli with the Big Rig sauce (a variation on the menu version). It comes with a slice of garlic bread as big as your head and you'll probably be able to eat leftovers for breakfast!

***The big ol' ravioli has been REMOVED FROM THE OREGANO'S MENU - which means if you love stuffed cheesy pasta Oregano's is no longer the place for you(us)!***"}
{"text":"Service is absurdly bad.  I called around 5:30 PM for a take-out pizza.  They told me it was a 2 hour wait.  I was dumbfounded.  I called Venezia's which is 20 minutes further away.  They said I could pick it up in 20 minutes, which I did.  Then 20 minutes back to the house and 20 minutes to eat it.  I still wound up saving an hour vs. Oregano's.

This is not the first time I've experienced a horrendous wait time at Oregano's, but it will be the last!"}
{"text":"Another place I took my softball team and they did a good job tending to us. The portion sizes were large and delicious! The service was quick and friendly. This is a fun atmosphere to be in and a great place to visit. Definitely recommend to check out when you are in the area!"}
{"text":"If you're going to make the effort to have pizza, find an Oregano's. Thin pan are both excellent and their pan is as good as you'll get even if you were in Chicago.  Not as good as Lou Malnati's, but you definitely wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"I believe this to be the best pizza in the area. It's nice to know not every place in phoenix NEEDS to promote having a brick oven. I don't care about brick ovens, I care about having a quarter inch of cheese"}
{"text":"Just got take out from oregenos, I asked 4 times if the Alfredo sauce that I was charged for was in the bag, reassured I drove home. Now if anyone has experienced this it's usually a roll off the shoulder or a shrug. But today it hit a nerve, I'm am so nice and polite, I say thank you and please, I worked in the industry for 6 years in college, he'll i even freaking tip as if I was eating in!!!! I know the insides and outs of the business, I never want to be thst person who pokes to just get free shit and I surely dont expect anything without paying for it!!! I just wanted to enjoy my meal and now I can't get into it because what's garlic bread with out Alfredo sauce when you are expecting it. 50 mins waiting and now I'm super disappointed. Thumbs down"}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times and somehow we always leave complaining about the service. Every single time we sit at the bar (which is every time) we're always ignored by the bartenders, simply for getting another beer or getting plates and silverware. We don't go during busy hours because we know how crazy it can get so its not that they're slammed. They always try to make themselves appear that they're busy and will completely disregard they have customers at the bar. They will walk past you numerous times without even looking your way and act as if they're a busy nightclub unable to multitask. For the most part I wouldn't complain about being left alone but rather than having regular tv with sports they have their \"oldies shows on\".  All in all, they're food is amazing but their service is really starting to get to me."}
{"text":"This place is OK. Pizza is decent. Usually takes a bit longer to get then I expect. Service is usually pretty good. 

Nothing special about this place. It does have a loyal following though. I don't know why. Is it the grossly over sized menus? The old swing/big band era music playing in the background? The pizzookie? I dunno. 

I'd be more tempting in returning here during non-peak hours, because when this place is slamming, there is a long wait at door to sit and a longer wait to get the food."}
{"text":"Love their food and the service at this location is always awesome! Yes, it can get insanely busy. That's because the food is great. It is now a Pepsi place again (I love that!!) My favorites include boom dip and wings. It's also kid-friendly with good prices & quick food. One more thing: they give kids some dough to entertain them"}
{"text":"This place does Italian well and has great staff.  I am especially fond of their pizza and bowl of pasta.  The bowl of pasta delivers a great angel hair noodle with delicious sauce and unlimited refills.  Their salads are also to die for.  The best thing on the menu is the pizookie or pizza cookie.  It is totally original to Oreganos and if you have not tried it and you have a sweet tooth, I highly recommend it.  Its a huge thick cookie freshly baked in a special tray topped with three scoops of freezing vanilla ice cream.  Absolute bliss!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  The hubby and I come every other week for lunch and split a heck of a slice and the Oreganos Favorite salad. They usually send us out the door with a huge to go drink, such a cheap thing that makes customers super happy. 

As a family, we eat here at least once a month. The thin crust is our preference and it never disappoints. The kids always insist on the pazzookie which never lasts more than 2 minutes on the table. 

It's one of our neighborhood joints and we love it!  You simply can't go wrong here...but be aware if you show up on a Friday or Saturday might be prepared to wait. It's not a huge place."}
{"text":"Today on 7/18 we went at lunch time and had THE BEST waitress!  Lauren was our waitress and she outstanding!  Whoever hired her made the best decision.  I normally don't review, but when something is above expectations, then it needs to be recognized."}
{"text":"A true italian pregame meal has been a mainstay of mine ever since I enjoyed one at the dirty padre a few years back. We were greeted by a stout young lass offering a selection of pizza, drinks, and hour and a half wait times. We decided to wait and ordered some tasty drinks (belini was fresh!). After being seated, we listened to some crappy stories my friend had to tell while out salad was delivered. This salad was a true blessing to our palates. We were truly living in the second book of Ruth! Once the meal was finished, I took the check and exclaimed, \"Bahama mama!\" What a  great meal for a great price. I loved it so much that I decided to leave them a gift in the form of an incredibly large dump in their men's restroom. I hope they have toilet insurance, because I am pretty sure I saw the toilet start to softly weep after I was done. 10/10 will enjoy again!"}
{"text":"The food was good and their pizza is great! Loved the atmosphere as well. The only thing negative was that they don't have \"make your own pizza\" during dinner hours, only at lunch time. Besides that, it was overall a nice place that I would go back to."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. Great food and atmosphere. The portions are huge, you will not be disappointed with amounts. The salads are large enough for multiple people, even their \"side\" salads! Pizza, wings, and sandwiches are delicious! One of our musts when we go is the Guac-a-Tony. Try it, you will love it!!"}
{"text":"First of all,  I've been coming to Oregano's since 1997.   I love this place and this was my first experience at the new location at 67th ave and Bell.  This location was overdue!  Too bad it's so small and the bar seating is only for four people.  Way Too small! Angela the bartender was very nice.  

Now to my food.  I ordered the Numero One -0 without onions and green peppers WITH Hatch green chili and extra cheese.  I received a pizza with onion and very little green chili.  The chili was right out of a can with no taste.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on Friday May 20th, had about a 15 min wait for a table which really isn't bad for this place. The food was amazing! We opted for a few appetizers instead of a main dish. The stuffed mushrooms were HUGE, and very tasty. The calamari is good as well, no tenticles yeah. The Minestrumbo soup was good but a little spicy for me. And I love spicy! Hubby had the toasted ravioli and didn't care for them, said they were like cheese sticks. I can't wait to come back and try something new.  =) 
Service was awesome , George was a sweetheart and so was his helper, I don't recall his name though. 
Btw the have a limited bar, not a full one."}
{"text":"The food is so good and so reasonably priced I wouldn't go anywhere else for a first date! The started salad is soooo big and they have pazookies which are amazing! I love I there, I recommend the Alfredo the dark pasta or ANY of the pizzas. Sooo good"}
{"text":"I and six others had dinner last night at  Oreganeo's and all enjoyed the experience. The food was excellent. A couple of them thought the sauce was a little too spicy, but still good.

We ate out on the patio with the temperature in the 90's. One suggestion I'd like to make is that they install a couple of ceiling fans. I think they would move the air around and make it a little more comfortable.

Two more comments:  The service was very good and the prices are reasonable. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"This is one place you can never go wrong with. Absolutely love it. The staff is amazing and did a wonderful job taking care of my friends and i."}
{"text":"Of all the things you can get here my favorite is the thin crust cheese pizza!
other things are great too but the crust and sauce are so good I can eat just a cheese pizza and be happy. I prefer not to sit on the patio because of the cheap chair they use but other than that is it good food."}
{"text":"With a couple Germans in tow, the boyfriend and I headed over to a late dinner at Oregano's.  It was a Thursday at about 9pm and we were seated immediately.  The hostess was friendly and our server was prompt with taking drink orders.  The high four tops in the dining room are way too small for four people and while I know they are trying to cram as much seating in there as possible, there really shouldn't be more than two people at those tiny tables.  

We ordered drinks and appetizers. I like that they serve Four Peaks beer on tap.  I always appreciate when a restaurant uses local products.   The Italian fries were decent, the calamari....not so much.  I thought it was quite rubbery and too thickly cut.    For an entree, I ordered the Southwestern Shrimp Caesar salad. This is my favorite item at Oregano's.  I know, I know it's a pizza place, but I really love this salad.  The shrimp are always cooked well and they take the tails off which makes it much easier to eat.  I love the cilantro mixed with the salad.  The salad this night didn't disappoint.  The boyfriend ordered a pasta dish with gorgonzola stuffed sausages, which he didn't even touch because he was so full from the appetizers.  But it looked great.  The Germans ordered a pan pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers.  The pizza looked great and between the two of them they happily polished it off.  Our server was attentive throughout the meal and was patient during the translation process when we ordered.

Oregano's is a place I've been to many times.  My only complaints are table size and the wait that you normally have.  I like the food but they are getting to be a bit chain-ish for me.  For pizza I'd still rather go to Grazie or Grimaldi's, but when some want pizza and some want pasta Oregano's is a decent alternative."}
{"text":"Love to eat here! I give 4 stars only because it's such a small place and it gets so busy. I hardly even go here because I have a wait time every time. Love the food but I feel that an expansion is necessary! 
My favorite dish to order: Alfredo The Dark"}
{"text":"Great food ate there last week and loved the pizza! Only downside is it took over an hour to get served after ordering on a mid-week evening otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. Same thing happened last time we went there so I am assuming that's just how it is there.  Don't go there unless you have a lot of time."}
{"text":"This place is always busy. Worth the wait though. Food is good and the portions are huge. You may want to consider sharing a meal. They have the best pizza in the area. I'm from Chicago and this is the closest I've found so far."}
{"text":"Always love Oreganos, today was not a good one. Tried the Ozone Especial...not that special.  Takes 30 minutes (it's their version of a calzone) was very salty and not much flavor. Looked more like two thin crust pizzas on top of each other. Also the noodles were not drained properly for the Big Rig and the sauce was really watery. Sorry Oreganos you usually are A+ but today you didn't bring the A game."}
{"text":"Biggest advice: come hungry! The portions are huge and you're guaranteed to be bringing home leftovers. We tried both thin and Chicago style deep dish and both were cooked to perfection. The originality of the menu makes you want to try their suggested pizza combinations, but will many to choose from you will have to make a visit here again. Only complaint: the music (fit perfectly for the restaurants style although) was a little too loud to enjoy the company around you."}
{"text":"Probably not good idea to order-eat at bar.  Bartender had one voice volume level and it went to \"11\" most of time.  Not best service either, I seem to have gotten on the pay no mind list and seriously even the water was bad.  Food arrived way too fast and was just ok-not up to previous meals there...wondered if it had been made for another order and had been sitting a while.  On upside big kudos to the mgr, she was very nice and did listen to my concerns."}
{"text":"lively scene. staff is friendly.  pasta all you can eat was very good. and you can custom make your own pasta dish.  their fat free cucumber italian dressing is good with the starter salad."}
{"text":"I will never come to Oregano's again. On a Friday night, we waited 30 min for a table, 20 min to have our order taken, 20 more min to get the appetizers which were the WRONG order, 30 minutes to get order main order! The waiter kept apologizing ... We almost walked out right before the food arrived. When we finally got to eat the waiter asked \"Wasn't it worth the wait?\"  The answer was a resounding NO."}
{"text":"OMG! The door service was amazing! Jenna was terrific! I showed up 15 minutes early to secure our party for 10. She was more then acomidating. She listened and understood my situation, as I had some elderly guests. I would go again just because of her! 

On top of that, the food was great and inexpensive as well. Our server Briah was attentive and cheerful. All the food came from the kitchen hot and timely.

Thank you, Oregano's for a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Expect a wait especially after 6 on Thurs and Fri. Sometimes an hour or longer. I really like the Boom Dip and Pizookie but I try to go during off times cause nothing's THAT good."}
{"text":"Always reliable, always very tasty, and always friendly. This is a great \"family\" joint and the bar is great for a good drink too. I usually sit at the bar. Wait times are usually less and the drinks are always flowing! I've been going to Oreganos since I move to the valley and have yet to get a bad pizza!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Oregano's has the best pizza sauce EVER! We got a pan-tossed pizza and some deep-fried ravioli. We were a little surprised to find the raviolis have hot peppers in them, but otherwise tasty. The pizza was epically good. I'd recommend going before you're starving because you will wait."}
{"text":"Best pizza since we moved from Chicago nearly 4 years ago!

We have been dying for a traditional Chicago style pizza and finally we have found what is by far hands down the closest to Lou Malnati's River a North on Wells in Chicago!

The thin crust is flaky and the sausage is flavorful! Although the sauce is a little loose for Chicago and could be a tad sweeter with a touch of basil, the fresh grated Parmesan cheese was the perfect touch.

5 stars until our next visit!"}
{"text":"I'm no stranger to dining at Oregano's but this was my first time at the Scottsdale location and my experience deserved a review. We walked in on the 4th of July around 9:30pm (they were set to close at 10:00) I was expecting not so nice service since they were probably irritated that we were coming in so late so I asked if it would be easier if we just get the food to go. The host was super nice and he said it would take the same amount of time for the food to cook so if we were going to wait either way, may as well take a seat. All of this with a smile on his face. We were promptly seated and our server came by and took our order. Food came out quickly, everything was delicious and service was great! Never felt rushed or as though we were an inconvenience."}
{"text":"There is a reason Oregano's is always so crowded people love the menu, food and waitstaff.. I know its going to be crowded and the parking is tough so time accordingly. I have never had a bad meal and have leftovers so if you thinks it's too expensive you are rally paying for two heals so it's not. If it's crowded we sit at the bar and the bartender Sullivan takes great care of us. He is amazing.. So go enjoy and don't be a food critic if you're always looking for something wrong you'll find it. Life is to short to not enjoy. If you don't care for Oregano's don't come back as the rest of us will be happy to take your seat..r"}
{"text":"Local chain that turns out quality pizza, pastas, salads and sandwiches. Portions on salads, sandwiches and pastas are big and very big. Their red sauce is excellent. Often times there is quite a wait, especially when you arrive with a big group. They do take-out, so that's an option. Indoor vs outdoor seating is your choice by season."}
{"text":"We moved to Scottsdale in 2002 and have been told how wonderful Oregano's is. However. every time we went there the wait was so long we went somewhere else close by. 

Then, when down in Tucson for a weekend, we found out we were staying near an Oregano's restaurant. Because of a tennis tournament, we were eating at odd hours, so we got in Oregano's easily on the off-meal hours. We fell in love with the Pablo Picasso salad. The large salad is about enough for two if you don't want to be stuffed. The pan pizza we had was also worth the wait.

In our new home, we are only a few blocks away from Oregano's at Scottsdale and Shea. Now, we just call in an order for a large Pablo Picasso salad and drive up and pick it up within 20 minutes. They often have pizza samples for people waiting for tables. They also offer you a free soft drink when waiting for a take-out order. So, we get a salad for dinner for two to eat at home for $11. LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great fun atmosphere.
We had an 18\" double sauce, double cheese, pineapple, sausage, mushroom pie! It was great...pineapple a new one for me.  The salads, we had Kale Ceasar, are huge and really fresh and tasty.  The interior is full of nostalgic items, you won't get bored looking around.  Booths are large and servers are great.  
I'm originally from Chicago...so pizza is my thing...this place is special, great sauce and lots of toppings!  Fun, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good LISH food on both lunch and dinner menus. This location at Elliot and Priest is good but others can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"Beware of take out orders being sub-par.  Tonight we ordered the big bowl of pasta, we've had this dish more times than I can count.  We got home and found we hand a huge mound of pasta, with maybe one table spoon of sauce.  The pasta was stuck together in a giant clump, with this dab of sauce on the top.  We ordered meatballs with the pasta, again three naked grey in color meatballs, with no sauce and certainly that one tablespoon of sauce wasn't going to help!  There is no way anyone should have let this poor excuse of a meal out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"There was so much hype over Oregano's and we were super excited to try this restaurant out.  So many of our friends rave about how yummy the pizza is.  Unfortunately, either we came on a really bad day or we don't appreciate pizza in the same way our friends do - we waited forever for our food to arrive.  When it did, it was really disappointing.  Not only did it not live up to the hype of being some of the best pizza in town, but it really wasn't good at all.  We did not receive exceptional service either - service was slow, bland and tasteless, kinda like our meal :(  We had a Pizookie for desert, but it came out completely burnt :( they remade it, but the waitress told us that the 2nd one ended up getting burnt, too.  So they were going to remake it a 3rd time when we just decided not to wait and to take off.  From there, it took another 15 mins to get the bill straightened out to remove the twice burnt pizookie that we never did get to enjoy."}
{"text":"Great experience!
Expected to be more packed for a Sunday evening (8:00 pm) but only had 15 min wait at the bar. 
Fast service & friendly staff. 
Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Though the food is wonderful I believe our server was unaware of the menu options since he couldn't repeat a single item ordered back to us properly. In the end our pan pizza was served as a thin crust. The dinner salad, though very large, was rather bland as well. My biggest disappointment though was with the service :-/ he truly had no personality and actually complained about having to serve us outside."}
{"text":"Best pizza I had in Arizona. More like Chicago-style pizza unlike others."}
{"text":"WOW I just drank the grossest most vile beer of my life !!!!  I've seen Frat initiations that were less gruesome. OK, Take a beer feed it to a paying patron, Let the ass of it mold and dry out then use that old moldy glass to serve your next customer. When I showed the waitress she looked terrified and tried to make up some excuse that it came from the keg, when clearly we could see what took place here. Later the manager came over and apologized as he was shocked. I had already consumed most of the vile beer before looking into the infectious glass. Oregano's you should be ashamed. Feeding honest hard working people this sh*@ is disgraceful. And I hope this post helps another hard working family avoid such a dreadful experience!"}
{"text":"From the appetizers, to salad, to sandwiches, and pizza a great place we miss, but visit 3-4 times a year when passing through or visiting Phoenix. Best in the summer months with outdoor dining. Wish they had one in our California beach areas."}
{"text":"There's a reason Oregano's has an hour wait on a regular Monday night:  awesomeness.  Luckily, it's almost never as long of wait as they say, and you can always relax and enjoy a beer or cocktail while you wait.  Our last visit was a party of 4, and we only waited long enough to have a single round before being seated (which is not long!).

Oreganos is just a fantastic overall value, and I've always had great service and food.  They've done whatever it takes to achieve the magic formula of restaurant success, and maintained this over a number of years.  

Parking can be a bit interesting for this location, and if you don't want to wait I recommend arriving outside the 5 - 8pm dinner rush.  The only other advice I have is the cookie Pizza is worth saving some room for!"}
{"text":"Sooo,, I've been eating at Oreganos for at least 10 years. Today we found a smushed up piece of foil in our Big Rig Pasta, it had lots of sharp points on it, the manager came right over very apologetic and let us know that the order was being remade and that it was  \"on him\" upon getting our check I noticed a $6.00 discount,  instead of taking the whole order off he only took half off, maybe we should have eaten the foil in order  to get the whole thing off,, I just think that was disrespectful and I don't think discounting $12.00 would have hurt there buisness. For this I'm giving them 1-stars and hope that next time they realize things could have been worst."}
{"text":"Sat outside on the patio. Hostess said the only table available had no shade, which was totally fine for sitting, but couldn't even touch our arms to the table it was so hot... Might recommend they get another umbrella for out there. 

The service and pizzookie were still great."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to the Tempe location.  It's a short drive to Sky Harbor Airport, so I normally stop in after my flight arrives.  We had a group of 10 people on a Friday night.  We arrived at 6pm to avoid a long wait.  After 20 minutes, we were seated on the outdoor patio.

They have a few TVs and a bar area that keep you occupied while you wait.  The baseball playoffs were on, and the local team (Arizona Diamondbacks) were playing Milwaukee in a decisive game five to advance to the next round of the playoffs ... unfortunately, all the TVs were playing black and white reruns of \"The Honeymooners\" show from the 1950s.  Several other diners were wondering why the game wasn't on, but the staff didn't get the hint.  The Diamondbacks lost in extra innings.  Go Giants!

We started with the bruschetta and garlic bread.  They were both good, but the bruschetta was the better choice.  We had four kids in our group.  They wanted more bruschetta, but we still had pizza coming.

They have a good selection of beers (bottle and draft).  We went with draft since they were still at happy hour prices.

Next, we had a large serving of the Oregano's favorite salad.  It was enough for 6 adults.  The salad was crisp, and the honey vinaigrette dressing was sweet.

The pizza was outstanding!  The kids went with a 16\" thin crust.  Half cheese, and half hawaiian.  It was the perfect amount for four.  After the pizza was brought out, they sprinkled fresh cheese on top.  My son is a picky eater, but he loved the thin crust.

We also ordered a 12\" Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola Sausage (with pepperoncinis).  I normally prefer pepperoni or sausage, but the combination of the gorgonzola cheese and pepperoncinis was excellent.  The 12\" was just right for four adults.

Two of my friends didn't feel like pizza, so they went with pasta.  They ordered the El Diablo Shrimp pasta, and the garlic chicken lasagna.  The servings are huge ... probably double the size of a normal serving.  I would have asked them how the pasta was, but since they both finished their plates, I'm guessing it was good.  Again, these are HUGE servings.

This was my first time eating here with kids, so we had to try the pizza cookie for dessert.  Incredible.  Why didn't I order this before :)

The food was great, but the customer service was even better.  Our server (Melanie) was outstanding.  We never had to ask for anything because she was always one step ahead of us.

The bill including two rounds of drinks and tip was $200.  Great dinner at Oregano's.  We'll be  back!"}
{"text":"Feel-good, quality Italian Food with a friendly staff.  They have it all...and for the most part...it's all good!  Shrimp Pasta is delicious!  Salads - on point.  Pizza - well liked.  And, oh yea...PIZOOKIE!  

Relatively good prices for the quality.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a pizza place, enticed by the baking crust and pasta sauce scents, ordered a pie, and then sadly underwhelmed by the bland pizza?  Well don't worry.  Oregano's delivers a good pizza pie!  Probably one of the better pizzas I've had in a while.  We chose to make our own thin crust pizza, since I wanted to highlight the toppings and sauce rather than a thick crust.  It was very good.  Oregano's has thick and pan pizzas as well, though I'm sure you'd need a bigger appetite to go for one of those.  We also started with the antipasto salad.  Great!  Nice mix of lettuce, onions, pepperoncini, and various cured meats.  

Portions are big here.  And the price is decent (you can see the menu online for specifics).

Service was pleasant and not overbearing.  We didn't have to wait to long after seating to get our pizza, though if you order a pan pizza or a cookie-dessert (we didn't), I hear you might want to order early to get it started since they may take time to bake.

Would go back!"}
{"text":"For the second time, I have called in a carry out order for a salad and been told it will not be ready for 45-50 minutes.  What's the point?  Sounds like Oregano's is trying to run off all their carry out customers.  It's working!  Bye bye."}
{"text":"Great pizza place. Love sitting out on the patio and having a cold beer and pizza. I've gone a few times and I personally say stick with their pizza. Had a seafood pasta and was a little rubbery.  Overall that was ok but seemed just a little overcooked.  Pizza is their strength."}
{"text":"If your in a hurry or an impatient person don't eat here. It's crowded most of the time because the customers enjoy the food and the atmosphere. If you gotta eat now or you will die go someplace else to eat. If you want a satisfying Italian meal at a reasonable price you won't be disappointed. We have tried many of the items on the menu and our favorites are \"The Antipasto Thing\" salad which is a huge portion and extremely tasty with a nice amount of sliced up Italian lunch meats mixed in it. The Original Italian Stuffed sandwich is very good and here again is enough for two people to share. The Chicago Style Stuffed Pizza is spot on but if your in a hurry \" forget a bout it\" and go somewhere else for pizza. Stop whining, take a chill pill. Sit down, relax, have some patience, enjoy the meal and then go home and complain to the dog.    \"Mangia\""}
{"text":"I haven't  had a bad experience here. My sons love this place.   On the normal eat out nights there usually is a wait. We always take home left overs.  The food is always good."}
{"text":"It would be really nice if this restaurant were willing to take reservations for large parties or at the very least add a little more space to the entrance so those waiting do not have to stand literally right in front of the door. 

We had a party of 8 people and waited 45 minutes. When we finally got a table the food took a very long time (another 45 minutes) and the server made multiple mistakes, including incorrect pizza toppings and a completely skipped pasta entree. They did make the entree to-go for free for him, which is always a good move, but that is still a rather substantial error and did not leave a good impression of the restuarant.

In terms of the food, well, I got a salad (which was good). I don't really eat pizza but if I did I would rather spend those calories on Pizza Hut than Oregano's. The Pizookie is good but can easily be made at home with store-bought cookie dough in the microwave and ice cream for a fraction of the cost and time."}
{"text":"Always a family favorite, today we had the Puerto Penasco Pizza today and it was INCREDIBLE! Well done Oreganos!"}
{"text":"Literally my favorite restaurant. I've been frequenting other locations of Oregano's for years and I've never had a bad dish or bad service. Their salads are high quality AND high quantity.  Seriously. Do not order their Really Big salad unless you intend to share with someone else. The Pablo Picasso salad is my all-time favorite. Do yourself a favor and try it. You will thank me later. Their pizza, pasta, and sandwiches are all delish as well. Their Chicago Style Stuffed pizzas are really unique (to AZ) and incredibly scrumptious. Beware that you will probably sport a nice cheesy food baby after consuming....even one piece is incredibly filling (the cheese factor in the Stuffed pizza is ridiculous.) 

I also highly recommend ordering their garlic cheese bread with marinara as an app and washing it down with their Bellini cocktail. 

Ok I gotta stop before I begin to drool."}
{"text":"Best place for lunch or dinner. I love the deep dish pizza! 
The Chicken Caesar Salad is phenomenal, out of this world, I come here every other Sunday with family to have a great dinner"}
{"text":"i would give it a zero if i could the pizza we ordered was very good but not what we wanted we specifically ordered a deep dish pizza but they came back with 2 regular size pizza's and after telling 2 waiters that wasn't what we ordered they were very rude because and told us we should have said something before we ate a slice, keep in mind we only ate 2 slices between the 2 of us. so at this point we just ate our food and let it go, then dessert time comes  and we are members of the kaboom club so we showed our coupon and asked for one pizookie half white chocolate-half chocolate chip abd our waiter comes back with one of each, we didnt complain because it would be free anyways but it was sucha waste of food.My breaking point was when we get the c heck and were charged for one out of 2 pazookies, and   drinks, and 4 pizza i was outraged and at the end of the day the didnt even try to accomdate us considering were paying for 2 things we didnt want, but we payed for the pizza and only 2 drinks and throughout the whole process we were given the worst attitude. I would love to go back and get what i orginally order (deep dish pizza) and i would love to get it for free, if and only if that happens will i be returning to oreganos"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Ohio and are we glad we chose Oregano's! I had the Zany Ziti- yummy and \"need a box\" size serving. My hubby & daughter shared the Italian Stuffed Sandwich. They tasted the ziti a few times too. They give both a thumbs up! We really did not have room but we had to try the Pizza Cookie. Save room for this when you visit.  The atmosphere was good too. Only thing to make the choice perfect was the service. Yep, our server, Travis, was on it!! He greeted us with a smile and took time to chat about our visit to the area. He was attentive and checked on us regularly. His upbeat personality and attention made the evening complete!"}
{"text":"Every time we visit this location  service is terrible. We have never gotten our food in less than an hour. Have waited as long as two. Does not seem to matter what day or time."}
{"text":"Great food. Thin crust pizza is awesome. Haven't tried the deep dish yet but will need good appetite. Service is always friendly. Suggestion for this location: get ther by 11:15 and you'll get parking and good seating. Little early but who's counting?"}
{"text":"Tried a Chicago style Pan Pizza. I had sausage,Green  Pepper, Onion and Fresh Tomato. It was Fantastic. By far the best Pizza I've had had in Phoenix. I'm from Chicago so I know good Pizza, this place is right up there. Thanks, we'll be back !!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst pizza of my life. We picked up after waiting 20 minutes longer than they said. We could not even eat the pizza when we got it home. The crust was so tough you could not cut it. The pizza was so awful we actually called the restaurant to tell them. They said it was because of the type of pizza we ordered!  Thin crust????  I don't know how they can be in business with all the competition out there"}
{"text":"We have been waiting a long time for Oreganos in Cave Creek. We have been patrons since opening day in old town Scottsdale 1993. You will have a wait but the food and atmosphere is well worth it.  The stuffed Número One-o has been a favorite from the start. If you can handle the wait, you'll love the food and be a fan forever.
Maureen and Greg"}
{"text":"ALWAYS a good choice; service, food & atmosphere. If you're not in the mood for pizza,try the \"Pablo Picasso Salad\" or the \"Alfredo the Dark\" pasta!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and the pizza was awesome. Staff was very polite and professional. Everything on the menu was fantastic."}
{"text":"Worst assistant manager ever.
Had a horrible experience(actually worst i've ever had)and complained. He didn't try to make the situation better just got snippy with us. Won't go into details because this place isn't worth the time to type it out.
I'll never go to this location again.
I don't blame Oregano's so i'll still go to Camelback or Scottsdale.....even though they are miles out of the way.

Edit: They fired the crap manager so it gained 2 stars
Alfredo the dark with chicken, bread on the side and a pizza cookie."}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus! I am carrying the most massive food baby right now. 

My husband was craving pasta so I researched some new places we could go to get some. Oregano's seemed to be a big hit so we settled on this place for dinner tonight. Let me tell you... no matter how hard you try, you will not leave here hungry. 

There was no wait for a table and we got to sit out on the patio. It was so nice outside tonight and the misters were going. It was very enjoyable. Our server was very friendly and fast. I like that the drink glasses are gigantic. Usually my husband and I drink water faster than it can be poured but these were so huge we only needed one refill the entire meal, and even before the glass was empty our server picked them up to get refilled. Points for that. I hate empty water glasses. We decided on the boom dip to start. It was good, nice chunks of spinach and artichokes, but it was extremely oily. It sits too heavy in my belly. This alone almost filled me up, so I can see someone making a meal out of just an appetizer. 

I decided on the big rig pasta and my husband got the alfredo. The portions were so huge! But his was not that good. Sort of bland. I was expecting it to be a lot creamier and have a more spicy flavor. Mine was really good though. It wasn't too spicy, but I was expecting more of a kick, and it had a nice creamy sauce. Pretty much by the time our pasta was in front of us I was full from the dip so I ate a few bites and had it packed up to go. I definitely have lunches for the next two days. By this point we were both so full it hurt, so we ordered the pizza cookie to go so we could eat it at home. Which was the perfect amount of time to start digesting some food. In the 30 minutes it took to bake it, pay, drive back home, and get inside I was already ready to eat it. So we sat on the couch and devoured the entire thing in less than five minutes. Food baby number two of the night.

I really liked the food here. You get ginormous portions so you are more than likely always going to take food home. It wasn't too expensive. $35 for the two of us for one appetizer, two pastas, and desert. I think next time we will nix the appetizer and just go with dinner. But the pizza cookie is definitely worth getting at least once. I may not come back right away but I'll definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I took my nephew there for lunch. He ordered pizza and I got an eggplant lasagna with a side of chicken and two drinks. The bill was $45! Completely ridiculous. When i asked the waiter he just went over the bill and that was it. Over priced and not even that great. The chicken was so salty and the pizza was burnt. Never going back."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner . Enjoyed our server Amina . She is fun and upbeat !!!  Thanks Amina"}
{"text":"Love their stuffed mushroom & all kinds of pasta, but not crazy about their pizza. It's not worth for average 30-min waiting time for a table. Too noisy there."}
{"text":"We've been here several times.  The food is pretty good.  But the wait time, um, no way.  Theres always a wait to get in, i understand that, you create an appearance of gosh we gotta eat here. 

But, after eating here its just not worth the long waiting.  I want to eat a great meal, not sit around watching others eat and drink."}
{"text":"Awful.  Pizza was disgusting (we ordered the thin crust.)  I've had better frozen pizza.  In fact, this might have been the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of having.  I can't imagine why people rave about this place, or why they actually wait for it.  I came here expecting the pizza to be amazing.  It was, just not in a positive way.  Never again.  What a mistake."}
{"text":"we usually just go to the bar since theres usually spots open. they do get crowded during peak hours..

okay for beer. everythings pricey overall. 

stuffed pizza is awesome with the right ingrediants.

(waffle) fries are top 3 in town.

wings cant complain.

good service. Shane is adorable!

'youre so Shane, i bet you think this review is about you, dont you?'"}
{"text":"Pizza, plates of pasta and wings oh and for desert their famous pizza cookie. The food was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza, great service. This place is always packed but dont let that make you think you need to go elsewhere. Give it a shot sit on the patio have a beer.
Deep dish takes a while, have a second beer.
Pasta is also good, meatball sub was really good and not a small portion either."}
{"text":"My mom wanted to go here for lunch last Friday & I was actually kinda excited, because it's been a few years since I last came here. Parking was a bitch & that was a task in itself! Any way, we made our way back to the hostess stand & was told there would be a 30 minute wait. For lunch, really?! We decided to sit at the bar where there was no wait. 

Lindsey was our server & she was so sweet, checked on us often too. For starters we ordered the bistro calamari & boom dip. I forgot how big the portions are, what were we thinking ordering 2 apps?! The boom dip was yummy but the calamari was just ok, way too much breading/coating! For our entree we decided to split the 14\" aunt margherita pizza (thin crust) & added artichokes. My mom only had a bite since she ate a lot of the apps, I had a slice & it was ok. Pretty bland in flavor, barely any cheese & the crust had a similar texture to cardboard. I took the leftovers home & my hubby agreed, he wasn't diggin the pizza either. 

Total (not including tip) was about $40. While the food was just ok the service was great! I'd like to come back & sooner than a few years, because I know I've had good food here in the past. I think next time I need to order some pasta & definitely the pizza cookie!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Delicious food, great service, super friendly. Michelle was our server and right off the bat she was very friendly and helpful giving us great suggestions. I can't wait to come back and eat here again and hopefully have her as our server!!!"}
{"text":"I love oreganos! They are always so warm and welcoming! There pizzas are amazing. Make sure to get their pazookie. It is the most amazing cookie cake you will ever have. It comes fresh out of the oven and melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I came to pick up a to go order and every single person working there ignored and acted like they did not see me for a good 7 minutes. Even though where you walk there is no way they didn't see me. I'm a generous person who always tips but not today!"}
{"text":"On the plane into Phoenix I asked a local that was seated next to me, \"Where should I take my Mom and brother to impress them with my Phoenix knowledge.\" She said Oregano's. She was right, both Mom and my brother knew and liked the place, so it was easy to convince them to go. 
When we arrived, the hostess took our order (pizzas take about 45 minutes) and we were inside in about an half hour. GREAT PIZZA and that is from a pretentious chicago pizza snob. The pizza was spiced well, plenty of sausage, and the pan pizza crust was the right amount of chewy. 
We also ate a pizzookie. (A cookie baked in a pizza pan, with ice cream and chocolate sauce). Yummmm. Plenty to take home and have tomorrow for breakfast."}
{"text":"All I have to say is I'm happy every time I go here. I love their new menu especially the eggplant pasta with penne pasta. Their white chocolate cookie pizza is perfect and I love ordering to go here. Service is very fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We had a long wait for our food, but it was worth it! The waiter was terrific, even with our large group. I ordered the children's size spaghetti, which he probably thought was for my 3-year old-granddaughter, and it was the perfect size for me! If you don't want to wait for hours, consider going early in the evening!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the wait times are ridiculous. Even for pickup, if you call and order, regardless of when u call , the expected wait for take home food is 1.5 hours to 2 hours. Something is seriously wrong with the Bell Road location.

No other oreganos in the valley has this issue"}
{"text":"While this wasn't our first visit to Oregano's in Gilbert, AZ, it was by far our most memorable.  With the exceptional help of the Manager Sean, and Server Jay-Jay, we so supremely hosted a part of 15 people for our Son's high school graduation on May 22, 2013.  Oregano's has been a family favorite of ours for sometime, and after leaving the area a few years back, we knew this was the place to host such a party.  The restaurants are always packed but that never takes away from the individual experience each party likely receives from their servers and chefs.  Their food is always tasty with nothing lacking in a robust menu.  

Back to our experience on May 22nd, despite being an overly busy night with many large parties, Sean quickly sprung into action to help our large party (and several others) get a seating area and service to make sure our evenings were a blast.  Our server Jay-Jay attended to our every need and made sure we were never without just what we needed.  He was excellent at his job and knew just what to suggest and when.  Our 3-hour evening on their back patio was perfect.  Even in the warm Arizona evening weather, a combination of misters and fans, along with ample lighting made the setting even more enjoyable.  

We would recommend Oregano's to anyone for a great meal.  From a quick bit with friends, to family gatherings to even take-out for the party at home, they have the food and service to make any occasion just right.  Thanks Oregano's for always being amazing!!"}
{"text":"So we rolled in for lunch and immediately this place was decorated like a yard sale Applebees. It gets two stars and here is why. The manager was the fastest service we got all night. She took the constructive criticism and said thank you. The second star was for the pizza dough that they provide to kids to play with while waiting for your food and please know you ARE going to wait. I ordered the sausage sandwich that was supposedly home made and my wife ordered some pesto pasta. Ok. We ordered pizza slices for the kids hat showed up in about fifteen minutes. Then the more waiting began. Forty five minutes later I get an over cooked sausage on poor bread with cheese. That's it. My wife got pasta but it came in a bread bowl? Not sure on the logic on that one. But come on chef was it a challenge for carbs? I must say the service was horrific. When brought my change it was over sixty dollars short. Stay away from here if you are in the area because it was definitely on the bottom of places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"We were in jan 24. I'm almost positve our server's name was jason.  (Young guy) He was great. Attentive,  friendly, polite. The beer was cold and the boom dip yummy.  We told him what time we had to leave, so he had the check ready. Even split it for us .  Thx we had a nice time!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent this location even though there are two closer to our home.   We patronize great food,  service and attention.   Mark Christiansen always goes out of what may be considered the norm to make our customer experience great.  We come to this location because of him.   The food is always good but appreciate his attention.   We would love to say its because he values us in particular, but we can see him provide this same experience to everyone else.   Makes it sincere in our book.   Thanks Mark again for today!"}
{"text":"So, I'll I had was the \"Fried Calamari\"  It was Good not the best I've had but not the worst either. The atmosphere was real nice. If you ever been to Oregano's you know it takes awhile to get your food even when you seat at the bar. I'll go again but not in any rush"}
{"text":"LOVED IT! OMG! It was a bit of a wait, but the pizza was great! The waiter was great! Oh, of course the pizza was so big we were able to take home plenty of leftovers! The restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Oreganos is another of my favorite Arizona chain restaurants. It's a great place to take a family or groups. Their beer, pizza, appetizers and pizza cookie are all consistently good. We have held a few family celebrations here and everyone leaves happy. Their portions are huge so you'll likely leave with leftovers."}
{"text":"The pizza here the deep dish pizza was sooooo awesome. It was cooked all the way through and the taste was amazing. This is a must visit"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for Italian, This is the place to go! My favorite is the big rig pasta with shrimp. I always leave room for desert, There pizza cookie is to die for."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Why the fuss or the great reviews?   I've gone to various locations - Phoenix, Tempe, Shea Blvd.  I don't understand why people will wait 30-45 minutes to eat here?  The service isn't bad, the atmosphere is nice.  But honestly, the food isn't that great (IMHO).   I've tried the Turkey Sub, the Chicken Fiesta Salad, the Italian Sausage Sub, the Margarita Pizza and others...nothing has impressed me.  I wonder if people love this place because they serve Cheesecake Factory-like servings (I've always had to take my food home in a doggy-bag).  It's about as faux pizza and Italian food as you can get.   Don't get sucked into the crowd-source mentality of friends raving about this place.   No way am I a fan of the food.  Period."}
{"text":"Great food. Everything. Plan on ordering too much because everything sounds so enticing. Also after 4pm plan to wait. This place is so popular you could wait and hour or more. Tough wait for kids. Service is excellent. The meatballs are to die for."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.  Great food great service I don't recommend often but this was great. Salad through main course was flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"Everything was so good we ended up eating WAAAY too much.

This was our first visit to Oregano's. My wife and I initially selected this restaurant due to other online reviews. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the pleasant sounds of Italian music from the 50's and 60's. Memorabilia on the walls and ceilings were from the same era. The smell of great food gave us a promise of good things to come. We were greeted warmly by the host, and after a short wait, we were seated in a comfortable, colorful booth. A few moments later, Marisa, our server, greeted us. When we told her it was our first visit, she took the time to go over the appetizers, main courses, and made suggestions based on our likes. We had two appetizers, the calamari with marinara sauce, and wings (we tried both the bbq sauce and Italian gold wings). We still haven't decided which we loved the best. On the recommendation of our server, because of the size of the entrees, my wife and I split an entree, the garlic chicken lasagna. After the appetizers, one entree was plenty for the two of us. It was excellent. Just enough garlic to enhance the flavor, but not too much to cause problems. Despite the fact that we were packed, we succumbed to Marisa's description of the pan cookie with ice cream, and shared that for dessert. Roy, the manager, stopped by to thank us for coming, and to make sure that everything was okay. When we rolled out of the restaurant, we were pleasantly stuffed. I don't think we will eat for a couple of days. The other entrees that we saw being served around us, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, etc., looked and smelled great, and all were generous portion sizes. (The salads looked particularly huge.) We will just have to come back multiple times and work our way through the menu."}
{"text":"I am from California and all I got to say is this place is the bomb. Garlic bread is awesome and so was the cheese stuffed pizza! I have never had a pizza with so much cheese!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and was a spur of the moment decision to go. I ordered the Monday lunch special 2 slices of Chicago thin crust with one having bacon and pine apple and the other sausage and onion I also added the garden salad and a appetizer of the calamari. My husband orders the Monday lunch special 6 in Chicago deep dish and a Caesar salad and we both had dr pepper to drink . It wasn't so busy when we arrived the host he was amazing very friendly and enthusiastic wish I knew his name but I can say he isn't boring . Our server was Jules she was also friendly and gave good service. Now the food is where they fell short we ordered the calamari way before the meal and our salads arrived before the calamari which my salad was not a garden salad but romaine and two very thinly sliced tomatoes and two pieces of thinly sliced red onion with ranch . When the calamari arrived it was over cooked and rubbery with a fish flavor I have only had calamari two other places and they were really good so I was disappointed in the flavor and rubbery calamari. The pizza arrived and I was told the next time I had to get both slices with the same toppings I looked at my pizza and to my disappointment I received Canadian bacon instead if bacon as I specified as bacon bacon. Then as I was eating my sausage and onion slice I noticed the fork I was using had a huge piece of dried shaved Parmesan cheese on the handle it went from the end of the fork to half way to the prongs of the fork. I lost my appetite after that and I didn't ask for the manager but jukes had him come out he did apologize for it and said he was embarrassed and because of the service I give them 3 stars . I may try them again but not too sure right now and we tipped Jules 15 bucks for being so awesome and she was very apologetic and earned it ."}
{"text":"To be fair I tried Oregano's twice in 2 different locations. I have tried lots of pizza in Arizona from many different restaurants. Everyone told me I had to try Oreganos....AND I can't figure out why!! The pizza is SOOO MARGINAL. No really, the pizza lacks flavor and super skimpy on the toppings. The last and FINAL time I went, I sat down at 1PM and ordered a pizza. I waited....I waited some more...While I was waiting, I watched 3 different groups of people sit down and all 3 ordered and ate before me...Huh? I just ordered a hawain pizza... 45 minutes later, I finally got my pizza. There was barely any pineapple on it. Then later that evening, I ended up getting the runs and severe cramping!! I will not be back to this place again! Grimaldi's is WAY better!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome staff. Make sure you bring extra time with you. This place is hopping!"}
{"text":"Friends recommended this place as a place to have pizza together. I wasn't thinking it would be anything special and how wrong I was! It was a fantastic pizza experience! Excellent thin, thin crust pizza. We gobbled down everything that was in front of us. Would definately go again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent service from beginning to end!!! Chris n Suzie were awesome... food beyond fantastic!!! Will b back at least once a week. Love it :-)"}
{"text":"The pasta and pizza is great. My favorite is the Big Rig Pasta. The House pizza and he pesto pizza are excellent too. It has been loud the past few times I have been there, making it difficult to have a conversation. The service is excellent. They are friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of Oregano's, but my last time there was unbelievable! I went on Veteran's day with 4 guys- one being a veteran. We mentioned it once that that was why we were out celebrating. When our to go bag was ready, every staff member in the place wrote on the bag to our friend thanking him for his service. After the bag was presented, the staff started coming around the table to shake his hand. It brought tears to all of our eyes. Their appreciation touched all of us- so not only is their food amazing, but the employees that work there are too.
De was the best-I highly recommend to sit in her area when you go- very high energy and  a sweetheart!
 My friend Tom says he will keep that to go bag forever."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is outstanding. Delicious pizza, pastas, and sandwiches, with a spicy kick! The garlic cheese bread is huge, much like the rest of their portions. You will be taking some home, to be sure. They are incredibly busy during peak hours and the wait times can be long. We like to go for lunch, rather than dinner, to ensure we get a table fast. Friendly vibes from the staff are palpable."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Scottsdale! Our waiter, Tyler, was so friendly and outgoing. He recommended great beer choices and sold us on the cheesy bread and spinach dip. The barbecue chicken thin crust pizza was amazing!"}
{"text":"Good Italian restaurant in the Tempe area. They have the best calamari ever. We had the lasagna which came out all right. The unique thing about their food is their delicious marinara sauce.

Will definitely  come back for more calamri."}
{"text":"We arrived at 1019 am , first timer , not knowing they open at 1100am. So we went to Home Depot, grabbed the honey due list, then back to the world of Italian!  It if was not for Renee' giving us that extra bit of hospitality BEFORE they had opened (offered menu's ,to go water etc.) we may not have returned.

We must tell you that the same five star service was extended by Cole, and Renee, and Cole, and Renee and Cole.  They did this to all the customers, I would call the a \"Power Wow\"!!!!!.  The food was excellent and very filling, the service was spot on to the point we did not want to leave! But when we did we saw the large line to get in!! 

I would highly recommended Oregano's of Glendale above all others!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"My son, his buddy and I came to Arizona and went to Oregano's Dispensary and our experience was phenomenal.  Our waitress Josie made us feel right at home and took care of us above and beyond.  On top of that the food was amazing and the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Highly overpriced and nothing special!  Yelp wants me to write a longer review but there is nothing more to say."}
{"text":"I've entitled this review, An Ode to Oregano's Pizza: A Love Story.
I can honestly say this is the best pizza I've ever had. It's the only time I've eaten a piece of pizza and my mouth immediately started watering for a second piece. Expensive but worth it. Real Wisconsin cheese, not stingy with the spices and an amazing selection of meat. The only negative thing I have to say about Oregano's is that it is making me gain weight like crazy. Shame on you for making such an irresistible pizza!"}
{"text":"Oreganos is my favorite restaurant.. the food is absolutely amazing and so affordable BUT I will never be at surprise location again. The service BOTH times I've been here has been so rude and complicated. I'm so disappointed with  this new location."}
{"text":"Wings were excellent.  Had the gold.  Tried the kelt lifter on tap which complemented both the pizza and wings."}
{"text":"If oregano's plans on seeing me again, they should have taken a picture"}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. I could have aten raw pizza dough with pizza sauce at my house.  So disappointed..."}
{"text":"We had their Margherita pizza . It looked and tasted like frozen pizza. Otherwise the service was good and our food came up quickly."}
{"text":"First of all, this place stays open late. Which is great. We went there one night at about 9 or later and every other restaurant was closed. Their sign said they were closing, but they brought us in and people still kept rolling in way past 10 pm. Thanks for that guys! we need somewhere to go to in Gilbert at that time. This is what I hate about the suburbs, everything closes so early.
The food is ok, Italian, but the servings are HUGE. Service is fantastic and very friendly. We will definitely go there again and again.
I forgot to add, the courtyard is so BEAUTIFUL. I just love to go and sit there and have a drink."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience.  Went with a baseball team.  Needless to say we had a bunch of very thirsty people. The food was great and fun atmosphere.  Then there was the service.  The servers were second to none.  They truly made the made our lunch complete. They even supplied a number of ice bags. We're not as young as we used to be.  Hats to the the staff.  We'll be seeing you again soon."}
{"text":"I will tell you a little story. TheHubby and I tried to go 2 times and finally went to Oregano's 20 minutes before they opened last Saturday. About 6 other cars were already in the parking lot with people waiting. Fifteen minutes before opening people started LINING up. We waited until they opened the door 10 minutes before 11. am. We were about the 10th party in line. We chose to sit outside as it was a beautiful day. We had decided what we wanted to eat while we sat in the car looking at the menu on line. After we were sat our waitress, who was one of 3 bartenders working that morning 2 of them waiting on people outside, came by. We order drinks, appetizer, and pizza all at the same time, 5 minutes of getting in the door... so 10:55 am. We waited 15 minutes to get our Bloody Mary and Bellini. The Appetizer made it out 10 minutes later. I am not a light weight but that drink and no food had my head spinning. We tried the fried ravioli and we would not get it again. It felt like a frozen product and the \"\"Cheese and Jalapeno\"\" filling was similar to a yellow tortilla dip product and not spicy or tasty. As our waitress came back around she asked how we liked it.. and we ordered TheHubby a beer and water for me. It took another 10 minutes to get the beer. Then we sat. and sat. and sat some more. one hour and 5 minutes after we sat down and ordered the # 1 pizza came to the table. We did like the flavors but the crust was too thin to make it a regular on our list of foods we would get again. Our waitress came again to ask how the pizza was (point here, the waitress does not deliver your drinks or food,,, it seems like they have runners for that) We told her it tasted fine and asked for the bill. After getting the bill and having our waitress pick it up to run the card she apologized for the long delay for the pizza. She told us when the FIRST one was made it had no mushrooms. (this was not an add on, just another ingredient on their #1 selling pizza) . No one had said this before and I am not sure I believe it. She was a very nice waitress and was very busy. I assume she had tables inside as we did not see her very often and we were right in front of the bar and she did not work there. We paid for and left the place at 12:35. Even if they had to remake a pizza this was extremely long to sit 2 people for table service. All 4 tables around us left with in 10 minutes of each other. 2 parties of 2 and two parties of 4. There is no excuse for service as slow as this except that a kitchen that cannot expedite food in a timely manner. Friendly staff, great drinks. the wait even when you are sitting at a table is ridiculously long.   It will be a long, long, time before I return to Oregano's."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, haven't had anything bad yet. Everyone is friendly and service is greay."}
{"text":"I love this place a co-worker also introduced me to this place. I usually order the Alfredo in the dark with chicken and it is delicious!!! The garlic bread is amazing too!!!! I eat here at least once a week. When I go with different people and they try other things they love them as well. You should defiantly try it."}
{"text":"( I have never actually had pizza here, friends say it was no good.)

 But a few of their other things are really really good. I always get the same thing every time I go..... 

You HAVE to get the Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad (OMG!!!) 

and you HAVE to get the Italian Gold Chicken Wings, 

and you NEED to finish with the Half Baked Cookie (1/2 Macadamia Nut & 1/2 Chocolate Chip)...

It makes me want to move back to AZ!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great selection of salads. It has also don't an incredible job creating a relaxing, pleasant outdoor eating space. I love eating lunch here alone or with a friend just to take a break from a hectic day."}
{"text":"I took my family to the Oregano's for my grandson's birthday. We waited over an hour and a half for our food.  Two tables that were seated after we were received their food and drink before we did and was out the door when we just started eating.  The waiter was MIA most of the time and when I tried to get his attention, he ignored us.  I will never eat at this Oregano's again.  I typically don't post anything but I was so upset that I had to post."}
{"text":"Incredibly poor service.  They \"ran out\" of their fried raviolis.  The insane wait times give the impression that the place must be out of this world good but really it's just the small restaurant size that can't accompany a normal restaurant volume of people."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Scottsdale. The waiters and waitresses are always fun and provide good service. The pizzas are great. I love the salads too. They have the best dessert a baked chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top and it is to die for!!!! Plus, the atmosphere is fun. You can sit inside or outside."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The El Diablo Shrimp Pasta is my favorite dish ever!  Always have great service and a great time.  Just be sure to get there early on Friday and Saturday nights as the wait can get up to an hour long sometimes!"}
{"text":"We have always had good service but the food is substandard. I have never been wowed by their food except for their pizookie. But it's supposed to be Italian food, how can you mess that up?

We only go back because others want us to join them. We never go on our own."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their Big Ole Vedge sandwich is to DIE FOR. I'm on a low-carb diet, though and had to find other options. The Beefstro salad is also heavenly!

Like other reviewers have said, the service can be hit or miss, but the food is always spot-on and wonderful.. When it's good, it's great. We go on off-times to avoid a long wait and usually the service is awesome. I wouldn't even bother trying to go on a Friday or Saturday night, especially with impatient kids in tow."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Oregano's. Who doesn't like their pizza and pasta dishes or their pazooki (i always share the half and half)?!

But recently, I found my favorite dish ever and will order it every time I go. After I realized how much I enjoyed it, I found out it's the healthiest thing on the menu! Or at least that's what someone told me. Either way - the Big Beefstro Salad is what I will be ordering from now on. It's filled with shaved rib-eye, jalapenos, sweet onions and a sweet serrano dressing atop the greens.

Oh, and sometimes I like to indulge in the Dirty Monkey - it's delicious, but strong."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place in town! Thin crust with pepperoni is the easy way to go.

Don't leave without having the pazookie!"}
{"text":"Love love their Ol Mexigano pizza! The service could be a tad slow, but who cares when you are waiting for a great pizza - at least i don't!"}
{"text":"We went to Oreganos today for the first time ever and before we even got to our table a very nice handsome man named Jake was already giving us advice on how to order a deep dish pizza the oreganos way. Once we got to our table we realized Jake was our server, and we were beyond ecstatic. We ordered the guac and although it took some time, we were delighted to find that the pita chips that are typically the pairing for guacamole was replaced by a delicious thin crust pizza and an overflowing cup of guac. After our delightful appetizer our deep dish pizza made its appearance. The pizza was deliciously cheesy and after we finished we devoured a warm cookie pie a la mode. The whole meal jake was attentive and helpful and kept us entertained between courses. The combination of excellent service, delicious food, and fun atmosphere made this a dining experience we will surely repeat."}
{"text":"Oregano's is a great place, definitely my top choice for pizza! They have toppings and combinations you've never even thought of plus. I'm not a fan of their deep dish pizza but their thing crust is to die for! Everything else I've had their I have loved. Cool atmosphere and great service, but do prepare to wait!"}
{"text":"So I had heard of Oregano's before, and know it's a smaller chain in the valley. That said, when told we would be going here I wasn't suuuper excited. I'd never been to one, but had heard they were a pretty good place for Italian. 
We went to this location because it was on the way home from the aeropuerto. As we drove up, I didn't even recognize it as being a chain-type place because it looked unique. It was jammin inside, so we ended up grabbing bar seats and ordering an appetizer to kill time and hunger. Once we made it to our table, we each got a different pasta dish and shared a little to sample other plates. I had the baked ziti, which was amazing. The 2 other dishes I sampled were great too! Great dishes, and nice, large portions...which creates more meals for the next day. Service was great at both the bar and our table. I loved this location (felt like a mom & pop place), and it even has a good size outdoor patio w/ heat lamps. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Great cozy fun place. Good drink selection. Great beer on tap selection. Service is awesome. First time here. Not the last !!!"}
{"text":"So the wait times are ridiculous..you sit elbow to elbow with the ppl next to you.. It takes deep dish or stuffed 45 minutes to an hour to bake. The music is so loud you can't hear the ppl at your table..I have no clue what the hype was about won't go there again.."}
{"text":"One of our regular spots! Try the Picasso sald! They also have a great Pazookie which is a hott cookie with ice cream on top! The atmosphere is very casual and easy going!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for almost a year now. I've had every pasta dish and the thin crust pizza. Everything was so good. Make sure to get an order bruschetta for an appetiser. That really makes the whole meal for me. On the service end, I've never had bad service. Sure, the parking situation is a joke and this place is always hopping, but MAN it is so worth it. If you want good Italian food, come to Oregano's."}
{"text":"Best place for italian food hands down. Service is always on point and our go to is Anna F. she is the coolest give her lots of money she is worth it. Impeciable server, she is always nice and professional and makes our experience enjoyable"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Not a fan of Italian food, but love the unique flavors. 

It also seems like this place is always busy. That's always a great sign."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.

Called in on a monday night @ 8pm and was told the wait for 2 was 45 minutes and the patio was full. Canceled plans for a nice dinner and ordered meal togo. Got there less than 10 minutes later to find that there was no wait at all and the patio wasn't even being seated. Hostess was for lack of a better term b*tchy. Spoke with manager who didn't seam to care. (which still doesn't make sense) Bought food and tipped togo person anyway (she was nice but apparently can't do her job and make sure order is right.) Came home to find order was cold and wrong and was charged for extra protein that was not there. Overall annoying experience. Will not be returning to that location. I recommend going to a different one. If they can't get it right on a monday night I am sure it would be even worse if they were actually busy."}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza I've ever had and I consider myself a discerning pizza connoisseur.  Service was great and the wait to get a table wasn't too long.  Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. I don't love all of it, but the service has always been great for me. The sweet potato fries and red pepper aoli are delish and I really like the calamari too. The pizza is a must! I also love the tropical iced tea and cheeky servers tees.

Bottom line: Any place that plays Louis Prima and has a cozy patio is 
A-okay with me!"}
{"text":"Service is good.  But checking in is another  story.  If you are not white you will wait. I'm  Mexican.  I was told 15 min or 20 min. No we waited 1 hour 20 min. Pass us up twice. Better at tempe,Chandler, Phoenix.  Not here......"}
{"text":"Always one of my favorites, food is always great, their salads are great and pan BBQ chicken Pizza is to die for"}
{"text":"I love coming here.  Not only is the Chicago style Italian food great, the staff is always outstanding!  They actually take time to get to know the guests-That is how you are treated -as guests not just customers.  they are on top of their game and I have never had anything less than great service.  Especially Austin and Paige at the Bar!
Since it is close to where I live, I get to go fairly often.  The swervers know me and my partner pretty well.
We usually get the same things too because they are terrific.  The ceasar  sald is a good portion to share while you wait for your pizza slice, spinach and onion for me and peperoni with extra sauce for my BF.  Sometimes I will get the Turkey stuffed-which is how you'll feel if you eat the whole thing along with it's yummy cottage fries.  I like dipping them in the incredibly hot wing sauce.  They warn me about it everytime and my guts hate it but my mouth loves it!!!
They are also famous for their \"pizzookie\", although it is called something else.  It is a rich decadant cookie with ice cream and chocolate sauce.  I am always too full to try it, but I see alot of them going out to other tables.  So it must be pretty darn good.
There are several locations through out the valley so chances are ther is one nearby."}
{"text":"Great pizza with good friendly service. Wonderful thin crust and excellent sauce."}
{"text":"Great little italian restaurant with really good food. They have a pretty good lunch special. One of the best pasta dishes is Alfredo the dark. It's a creamy dish that has a spicy kick. 
If you come in the evenings the wait can be anywhere from 20-45 minutes."}
{"text":"Great experience today! First off our waiter had a great attitude & was the nicest so that made the experience that much better. We ordered the Mexican fried ravioli things. I dont know their name. They were good, not excellent (only reason I didnt give 5 stars). I ordered the stuffed riga tony & it was really good & the helping was a decent portion, enough for leftovers. My husband ordered a mexican style pizza which was big enough for 2 so I had a slice & it was delicious! Then of course we got the pizzookie for dessert, half chocolate chip cookie, half peanut butter cookie with ice cream on top :)  Sooo good! I'd recommend this location to anyone, just come early as all the oregano's locations fill up fast!"}
{"text":"A very popular hang out and the service is popping. I've been here when it's slow and busy (mostly busy) and the staff is friendly and outgoing. 

Food is good. The ambiance is warm and lively - as Oregano's usually are)) Eat more pizza!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth 5 stars! I've never had a bad experience at Oregano's. It's great for any occasion. The pizza is outstanding and the pizookie is to die for, and the staff is always friendly. You will not leave here hungry or disappointed!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Lawrence stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer and the Clark street spicy meat lovers pizza. They were both hella delicious and we'll definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"I travel to Phoenix nearly every month on business, and usually stay one evening in Chandler.  When I do, I always head to Oregano's for dinner, and order their salad and a medium pepperoni pizza.  It is the best of the best! 

Their salads are fresh and cold and large enough to share with 3-4 people.   And their pizza is always piping hot, loaded with toppings and cheese and a taste that is amazing!   Make sure to ask for extra cheese when they sprinkle fresh parmesan on top!

Usually try to sit in the bar area or a high top."}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD!!!  I don't know why I've been in AZ 11yrs and this is my 1st visit  here. AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"We had Daniel as a waiter tonight and I am highly upset with the service he provided us. We sat in the middle section and we ordered a chicken Lasagna.  Less then three minutes later he came out with the chef and brought us a chicken salad. 

I ask him did this come with our order and he told us this is what we ordered. When I told him that we did not order this but we ordered the chicken Lasagna the chef apologies for his mistake and told us to keep it. They both walk away and my wife started to eat in the salad. Less then two minutes later Daniel came back and snatch the plates from our table while my wife was eating in the salad and had her fork in the salad. He pretended to act like he was going to the back and brought the same plates to the customer behind us. Then I told him why did he give them the same plates we had and he tried to lie and said that he did not when it takes at least 10 to 15 minutes to make their food. He did not know that I talk to the customer and look at the plates he gave them and it was the exact same food. So he had to give them the plates we had. Then he did not even try to compensate them for his mistake and try to cover it up. That is why I am highly upset. If this is the type of service I am going to receive I will take my business else where."}
{"text":"Every time we go it gets progressively worse....bread with your salad will be $1.00, extra dressing 50¢.  Never again....."}
{"text":"I ordered a 12 inch Clark St. Meat Pizza & 7 piece chicken wings hit for myself and man they were good!!!! The pizza is def. one of the best I've had. I recommend this place to all pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Don't Eat Here! PHIL the manager is a jerk! He stereotyped our group, cut us off after the 2nd round because our large group of 15 was \"loud\". We waited over an hour for food and had our children with us yet we were accused of coming in hammered. We had no drinks prior too and came from a sporting event for our kids. I was utterly disrespected, we are not drinking in excess with our children. 
I am livid at the stereotype and PHIL the manager needs to receive proper training."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great! Rachel the bartender is very accommodating  and friendly without making it seem like she's just asking for a tip. She even gave me a mixed up drink order on the house! Food was delicious- BIG portion sizes. I suggest for a fun/casual dining experience sit at the bar! Definitely will keep this place in mind for future AZ visits (oh... And make sure you spring for the cookie for desert...they can package it to go!)"}
{"text":"Cody is stiller.   Ask for him, he will not disappoint.   He is attentive, fun and a 
great listener.  We will be back and we will ask for you.    Thanks for your great service tonight!!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch here yesterday
Very good Pablo Picasso salad excellent and enough for today leftover
Service very good too
Friendly and fast
Reserve the last star for next visit"}
{"text":"Welcome to Glendale,  you have a great establishment.  Your hostess was friend?y, the wait times showed us it was worth our time, the beer was good and cold, and of course the thin pizza is great.  We had the Numero  One O nod it was delicious.  Out server was pleasant and very knowledgeable.  

I would like to recommend that they check out the Surprise area, for a place to open next, the 303 is done I. That part of town and we are in need of a food pizza place.  

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"OK, we were looking for a place to eat after we left the Phoenix Zoo yesterday.  I used the Yelp app on my droid and found Oregano's.

We were seated right away and the staff was very, very friendly.  Their beer selection is okay and the draft comes in three sizes.

We started with the Italian Gold wings.  Delicious!  Loved 'em.  Wish we ordered 14 instead of 9!  

I ordered the Italian Stuffed sandwich.  Loved it.  Couldn't finish it and brought half home.  My wife got a pizza and ate the whole thing herself.  Just kidding.  But the pizza was great.  A nice, thin crust.  

We'll head there again to try the deep dish!"}
{"text":"Spent 5 days in the Phoenix area and somehow we ended up eating at Oregano's twice. I was impressed both times. Service was quick and pleasant. 

First trip I had the Zany Ziti with meatballs. I was not sure what I was getting into then it come to the table. It could have fed a small army. Served in a Bread Bowl jam packed with broken up Meat Balls mixed in with the Ziti and covered with Cheese. What more can I say the HEAVEN! I was only able to eat about a third of it. Made for a great lunch option the following day.

The second trip I was in a group of 11 people. We sat out side on the deck and enjoyed a combination of appetizers, pizza's, and finished it off with a Pizza Chocolate Chip Cookie - WOW!!!!"}
{"text":"Must. Be. Patient. We tried Oregano's tonight while on a business trip. Kitschy decor, mid-20th century music and concrete floors make this a vibrant and noisy place. If your kids aren't famished (or if you have some snacks to tide them over while you wait for food), it seems like a good family spot where you don't need to worry about noise, or a place to meet friends and have some out-loud laughs.

We were immediately greeted at the host-stand and seated inside upon arrival (7:20 p.m. on a Wednesday evening); outside seating had a wait.

Food was decent. My colleague had the wings and I ordered a meatball side along with the All Kale Caesar salad. Service was pleasant but slow from the start, and progressively slower through the meal. Drinks took about 10 minutes. Food took at least 45 minutes to get to the table (I stopped checking my watch after that), but was near-temperature by the time it arrived (meatballs warm but not hot; salad room temp and not hot, thankfully). Regarding the Kale Caesar, the dressing was de-lish, with just the right hint of anchovy, and All Hail! those \"croutons,\" which were some sort of amazing and wonderful broiled cheese cube with the crunchy light texture of fresh-made buttered bread croutons. Salad not too heavily dressed either, which I really appreciate. I did take over half of the salad and one of the two meatballs home. Big portions.

Didn't have the patience or energy to order and wait for a pizza-cookie dessert thing. Maybe if I'm in town again, I'll order that first and skip everything else."}
{"text":"Both visits here were not the best. It's the service that seems to be lacking. Overall, it takes a long time for the wait staff to get your drink order, then food order. Food takes way too much time to arrive after ordering (the last time I went it wasn't crowded, so the kitchen wasn't being slammed with orders) and doesn't arrive at the same time if you're in a group.  The food is decent, but certainly not great. 

If they can revamp their wait staff operation this place certainly could be great."}
{"text":"The food is just average but the service was horrendous. We were told 40 Minute wait for a table but were seated after about 10 minutes. Our waiter was so slow to come take our order, to let us know after half an hour that our salad and wings were \"almost up\", to actually bring our order and to handle our check. So glad he had time to goof off with his other waiter friends. It makes me sad because I was excited to try Oregano's."}
{"text":"Save room at the end for a pizza cookie! I even converted my sweets-hating husband to a pizza cookie fan!"}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients fun place with a good vibe.. A various array of people, server was kind and very informative of the menu!! The pizza cookie is one for the win!! Highly recommend this place.. Also, there's a nice selection of vegetarian friendly food:)"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing experience. Ordered the \"Jumbo Chicken Parm Pasta\" that's marketed as having \"HUGE all natural chicken breast served on a bed of fettuccine\" but yet when I got my order it came with a handful of pasta and a chicken breast the size of an Oreo... and they have the audacity to charge $11 for that? Yeah no thanks, not going to return and waste money on that again"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of pizza...but I like this place because they have really good food in addition to pizza. The wings are AMAZING. You can't get two seperate flavors in one order of wings (which kind of bummed me out), but you can get the sauces mixed together. So the waiter suggested the Wong sauce mixed with the Medium sauce...holy cow! So so so so yummy! And I tell you what, that medium sauce has a hell of a kick. I was sweating by the time I got through my 5th wing. I'm kinda afraid to try the Hot sauce.

I've also tried their Meatball sandwich. I got the Junior size and still couldn't finish the thing! I also got the side Chicken Ceaser Pasta salad which was tres delicious.

You can also get giant stuffed pizzas which I hear are amazing, but they take about 40 minutes to get to your table which gives you plenty of time to fill up on beer. Which brings me to my biggest piece of advice if you plan on eating at Oregano's: wear loose fitting pants.

The location on University is always pretty busy, parking can be a bit messy and they won't seat you until your entire party is there. So I recommend carpooling."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've eaten here multiple times when visiting family and I look forward to it every single time. I started my meal with the meatballs, which were delicious and drowning in marinara and coated with mozzarella. Hands down, the Shrimp Diablo is by far the best entree I have ever had there. They obviously have amazing wings, pizza, etc. But the pasta had huge jumbo shrimp, served butterflied, in a spicy creamy sauce with linguine. The sauce is an amazing marriage of spicy and smoky. It was out of this world delicious. The staff is always kind and courteous. The venue is always clean. I can't wait to go back again, maybe tonight!"}
{"text":"I NEVER have done this.  I'm from California and I have been to Oreganos and enjoyed everything.  Well this is a turn around. I'm sad to say. From the pizza extremely salty, garlic bread was saturated with butter to the point you take a bite and butter dripped.  Yuck.... Kale salad, also too salty.  I don't understand what has happened, someone in the kitchen has a heavy hand in seasoning your food.  Like I said I'm from California, sitting my grandsons, wanting to have a special Saturday dinner working on a puzzle and just having fun.  That was short lived."}
{"text":"I love this place. I think the Pan pizzas are the best pizzas there. Fun atmosphere. Fun staff. Everyone is extremely helpful and bring to life the joy of eating out."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday to meet a group of old work friends.  I called last week and tried to make a reservation as there were eight of us.  I was told they don't take reservations.  We were there a little after 11 am and when we got to the front of the line were told we would have to wait an hour and fifteen minutes to be seated.  Ridiculous.  We left and went to Arribas next door.  We were seated immediately and great food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Ordered four different items and all of them are way to salty. Not your traditional Italian food. I would recommend Maggiano's or Anzio's. FYI Maggiano's is a scratch kitchen!"}
{"text":"Service is alwayse super friendly and attentive. Love the salads and deep dish pizza is a must have!"}
{"text":"Super busy night only three days after opening...Oregano's Cave Creek was Fantastic!!!!  Owner personally greeted our party of six. Tanner our waiter surpassed any person at every place we have eaten at in the phoenix area.  Can hardly wait to return!"}
{"text":"So happy to have Oregano's in Chandler!! It's a great location and outdoor seating was very pleasant. Good food and quick service! 

Went today for lunch and the place was so packed (typical for Oregano's) that we could hardly find a parking place. The hostess told us the wait would be around 25 minutes, but we were seated within 15 minutes. Our server, Reno, was totally awesome and very attentive to our table. 

I had the Picasso Salad, which is a favorite of mine! As with all the other Oregano's, the plates are huge portions and totally delicious! Especially the cookies!!"}
{"text":"After hearing all great things about Oregano's I tried it out a few days ago.  The Chicago Pan pizza is a good price for what you get.  One or two slices is enough to fill you.

Their Jalapenos are RED which make it hard to decipher between the big chunks of tomatoes that come on the pizza.  So warning if you are trying to split a pizza and someone doesn't like spicy.

Skip their 7 zins wine if you are driving.  I had only one sip to sample it and I smelled like I polished off a bottle.  Go for their pizza cookie instead of their new item of fried dough, its not as tasty as they make it out to be.  The pizza cookie is a cookie the shape of a pizza for those of you who have never had one, its good.  

The best part about Oregano's is that they DON'T sing for you for your birthday.  Other places its annoying and gives me a head ache!  So go and enjoy a scream-free eventing."}
{"text":"This place always seems to be so busy.  Good food at a fair price.

They were understaffed during my last visit, which needs some attention.  Overall, a nice family restaurant with a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great experience!!! I hadn't tried the Mesa location yet and I went in for a yummy bowl of pasta and left not only satisfied, but incredibly grateful for my wonderful bartender/server! If you make it into this location make sure you ask for Ashley! She is fun and spunky and fast on her feet. She knew all the regulars and her smile was contagious! Best experience at  Oregano's by far. I will be back for the Big Rig and Ashley."}
{"text":"This is one of the best casual dining experiences in Scottsdale. From the moment we walked in and were greeted by the friendly hostess, asking us were we wanted to sit, rather than plunking us down at the closest table. Our waiter, Matt, was exceptional. We let him know this was our first time dining at Oregano's so Matt took the time to explain what Oregano's is best known for in each category, appetizers, salads, pizza and pasta. We opted for the Antipasto salad, Jr., which was huge. My husband & I split the salad and then ordered the thin crust Margherita pizza; billed as Chicago style.  Being from Chicago, the thin crust lived up to the hype. The fresh tomatoes were perfect.  My husband (usually very reserved about a recommendation) admitted this was one of the best Antipasto salads ever. 

We will definitely be back with friends and hopefully Matt will be working. After traveling across country, he is a stand-out in the restaurant industry and made our first dining experience at Oregano's an absolute pleasure. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for deep dish pizza but unfortunately did not get to try it due to time constraint. I however had a salad and he had the meatball sandwich. He loved his sandwich and I enjoyed my salad but I'm disappointed in how HUGE the portions are. This is why America is obese. I'm sorry but as much as people get excited about huge portions for their money, it's ridiculous to me. No one needs that much food!! Places like this really turn me off b/c they only contribute to the obesity epidemic. Yes you can have it for lunch the next day but you can't help but overeat at this place. I personally won't return but I'm sure my bf will cause he loves deep dish pizzas. I'm giving 4 stars for the taste but still, they need to have some portion control here."}
{"text":"We go to AZ for a few weeks every years, and we hit Oregano's at LEAST twice! It's so great for families, the food is to die for, and the service is super friendly. It's no wonder it can take over an hour to get a table!

This is a relatively small place, considering all the people that love to eat here, so make sure you get there early. Since we always have a large group with kids, we go around 4:30 to get started, and we spend a few hours. It works great. The bar is also really small and only serves beer and wine. This isn't bad unless you're with a LOT of kids... then hard alcohol would be nice! LOL

I have never seen pizzas this size before. The pest penne past is incredible. And... I know, I know... they have great salads! This is definitely a \"sharing\" restaurant! 

We love Oregano's and we all look forward to our nights spent with the Oregano's family! 

See ya next spring!"}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix over the holidays, I mentioned I was turkey'd out and could use a good pizza.  Friends immediately said we had to go to Oregano's for a Grandma G's?!  We arrived and I was skeptical, the restaurant was filled with tons of tchotske, but the staff quickly won me over with their friendly enthusiasm and attention.  So, we had to get \"the  usual\" - Oregano's favorite salad, Grandma G's pizza, and the BIG cookie.  I was in, but remained suspicious.

The food is HUGE...and shockingly, good!  The salad easily fed the four of us and was not swimming in dressing as I was expecting.  Off to a good start.  Then the pizza came...did I mention that the food is BIG?  First you have to adjust your thinking from pizza to flatbread.  Once you're there, the cornucopia of ingredients in the G'ma G's isn't overwhelming - garlic chicken, tomatoes, gorgonzola, havarti and other cheeses, potatoes, caramelized onions and fresh rosemary.  Wow, it was completely addicting - the flavors melded and didn't clash and the crust was like a crip cracker (I heated the leftovers up in a frying pan the next day for breakfast - deeeelish!).  OK, so at this point we didn't really have room for anything else, but we ordered the BIG COOKIE (YUM!).  We went with the peanut butter chocolate cookie, which is barely baked to warm, gooey amazingness and then topped with scoops and scoops of ice cream.  WOW.  I would go back just for the cookie and almost made my hubby stop by for one 'to go' as we headed out of town.  

PS: There was no wait the day I visited."}
{"text":"Currently at the place - have been waiting for the a pizza for 30 + mins... Haven't seen such slow service. When there is hardly any rush and when at other locations I have seen much better service"}
{"text":"5....AMAZING...STARS. If there were 10 stars I'd give it that. Came here with the family on a Saturday around 5pm, mildly busy took us 25 minuets to get sat, (understandable) had a great house salad to start off with. We ordered a deep dish pizza \"the works\" it took a solid 35 mins, but when the pizza came out, it was well worth it. I'm from California and have traveled all over and have 100's of different types of pizza, and this pizza I had tonight, was by far the top 2. Very cool atmosphere, very, very friendly staff! Perfect place to bring your family! We will definitely be returning back soon! ENJOY!:)"}
{"text":"I do believe this is their new location. 
I went on a Sunday evening to enjoy a good pasta dinner with a friend of mine. Our friend is a waiter there so we got to see him in action. I was appreciative of the swamp misters they had on full blast because it was VERy hot that night, but I slipp and went sailing on the concrete from the patio and our waiter wiped off the puddles from our table multiple times. There were only 2 out of 4 seats that were dry enough to sit in at our table BUT we did request the patio so we sucked it up. 

I love the atmosphere at this place. Granted I wasn't a fan of the misters, I loved the music and the overhead lighting and the vintage TV in the corner playing old B and W movies. That's pretty cool. I just wish their pasta menu was a bit more of a variety. I was craving some white pasta but my only choice was the basic alfredo... hmph.

I got the Zany Ziti and it was still so delicious. Came in its own bread bowl and i couldn't finish the whole thing. That's how big it was. I still recommend this place especially over something as basic as an Olive Garden or something. I've heard the pizza is THE item to get off the menu. But if you're searching for that super authentic Italian taste may want to try a pasta house.


Always ask for Cylee! He is an outstanding waiter, very personable, and genuinely wants you to enjoy yourselves."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. Always good food and great service. My only negative is that I'm ALWAYS too full to order their pizza cookie for desert!!"}
{"text":"There was no relief from the 100 degree heat as you walked in it was stuffy and warm. The host offers you a table outside... really? 
You wait and they sit you down give you a drink and explain that nearly everything in the menu takes an hour to make so i opt for thin crust pizza HORRIBLE. 
GREASY, WET crust in middle burnt edges, took forever to get to us (45 minutes), the waitress was too busy flirting with off the clock employees at the bar  to offer a refill on drinks  once she did she refilled my dr pepper with a pepsi, 

I was going to order desert and salad but after everything i couldnt wait to get out

Oh yeah and the bathroom is outdated, the lamp above our table was filthy

This resteraunt is a has been, i have had better FROZEN pizzas than this.

I regret not walking out right away."}
{"text":"We love eating here at least twice a week! Besides the long wait time at night, this place rocks! I recommend the wings and always save room for their dessert! Yum! They have huge portions so we typically share a pizza and salad. Great family place!"}
{"text":"My family and I don't go to Oregano's very often but every time we have gone it has been amazing. We usually go for special occasions like birthdays, graduations, etc. The workers always have a smile on their face and have great customer service. The portions are quite large but its always great to take home some left overs which the waiter/waitress do themselves. The atmosphere is always friendly and pleasant. It is always clean and they play music throughout the restaurant. Also the servers are always communicative and interact with the customers well.

The food is astounding. Every time I go I get the Alfredo the Dark which is delicious. It is a spiral pasta with creamy sauce and diced tomatoes topped with a jalapeno. it also comes with their 'south of the border' bread. For dessert I get the pizza cookie with ice cream on top. All in all, I think that Oregano's is just amazing and the best place to eat."}
{"text":"Visiting from Florida, service is spot on & attentive. The wait on a Friday night was less than 15 minutes. So at that point ya step into the bar, order a drink & pass the time w/ good conversation. Restaurant is centrally located. They offer an outdoor patio w/ lots of tables. The ambience is Italian pizzeria w/ Frank Sinatra playing in the background. Highly recommend ordering the Antipasto to share w/ the table. There is enough food on that plate to feed 4! Best antipasto I have ever experienced. Trust me when I say this isn't a salad you eat, it's an experience. Also had their thin crust pizza w/ sausage. That pizza pie was tasty as well. If you ever find yourself across from the Holiday Inn in Scottsdale, Arizona, near old town you would be amiss if you didn't stop by."}
{"text":"Been to several Oregano's.  Always a good experience.  This was our first time at this location and the first time disappointed.  The Chicago deep dish took a looooong time to come out and had a crust like leather (no exaggeration).  We sent it back and got a thin crust, the manager was very good about taking care of us as customers.  But the kitchen staff must have gotten irritated because I and another two in our party came down ill immediately afterward with indigestion to nausea.   We've all agreed we are too nervous to return to this location, but will go back to the Scottsdale and Shea restaurant which has given us great food and service on every occasion."}
{"text":"Fun place,  good food,  good service.  Boom dip was tasty and chicken lasagna was huge.   Good prices"}
{"text":"Get the Link Sausage!!!  The flavor was brilliant.  It is house made and This was my first time to this location.  I've been to other Oregano's in the past, but obviously I did not know what I was missing.  A friend and I went and there was a line of people waiting.  We were able to sit at the bar and eat dinner.  Be aware that they have Pepsi products.  I love Diet Coke and so I had to have soda water.  That is my only complaint.  We had a starter of Sausage and Meatballs, wonderful taste, a Ceasar salad and the Clark Street Pizza.  The pizza was better than my expectation and has been added to my list of the best pizza so far.  I was not expecting that from a chain.  The service was excellent and the bartender Josh was amazing."}
{"text":"This was my first time checking out Oreganos, so I can only judge off of this one visit. We ordered the chicken caesar salad, a mini stuffed pizza, and a thin crust pepperoni slice. I thought the food was way too salty - like the kind of salty where you get that unquenchable thirst, and end up drinking glass after glass of water. It wasn't inedible, but it was certainly the most dominating taste to me. Im also someone who loves salt - just not as much as oreganos i guess. Too bad, because I was thought the prices were very reasonable, the menu was appealing, and the service was excellent.

We ordered the cookie pizza for dessert and it was delicious. The cookie part is left pretty doughy by design, but i think chocolate chip cookie dough is better that way anyway. Id go back for that dessert (only $5 and fed 3) but not for the other food.

{"text":"Expect the slowest service you have ever seen.  3 hours for a meal on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"I called for a take out order on a Sunday at 6:20pm and was told my order would not be ready until 8pm. An hour and 40 minutes to make a pizza and an order of wings? That is absurd. Definitely will not be considering this location on a weekend again."}
{"text":"Not accessible. Thumbs down  Also indifferent customer service not putting any effort to help us. This really should be zero stars because I never even got to eat here. Visiting Phoenix I wanted to try a local fun Italian restaurant. Based on the website I couldn't wait to try this place. I got there and they only had high top seating and booths with tables to big for the booth. The only offering for wheel chairs is outside seating. Separate but not equal. Sorry Oregano's our party spent close to $300 at Bucca where we received bomb food and stellar customer service."}
{"text":"Price was reasonable, for the large portion sizes.  The food was okay but nothing to rave about.  I would go again and try a different plate."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customer service.  Quoted wait times that are not accurate and on different occasion manager wouldn't even take our name because we were a party of 9."}
{"text":"The food is great the atmosphere is like a 1950s diner very nastolgic decor. The service is ok but the hostess is extremely rude. She is almost happy to deliver the news that you will be waiting 45-60 minutes for a table. Not very helpful to direct you to the bar and possibly spend more money on a drink."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The food is great and the servers are awesome. :) The caesar salad is yummy."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and our bartender/server was Adam and he is very good at what he does! He is a great bartender and is great with customer service! We will definitely be looking for him when we come back!"}
{"text":"We had to wait to be seated. Wait time for a party of more than 10 was around 45 minutes. I read the reviews before and anticipated the wait. Sat at a table with the high/bar chairs which are uncomfortable for me but seems to be the newest décor in most restaurants. Had the Boom Dip and The Sproccoli with Sausage. The Boom Dip was very good and impressed the other in our party. Asked for extra chips and made for a good appetizer. The wait time for the appetizer was approx. 30 minutes. Would have this again when visiting. 

The pizza was very good and freshly made. I would like to think that the reason why it takes so long for your order is because everything is prepared after you order, but I am not sure. In any event, as the previous reviews indicate, you will have to wait before having a meal. Wait times for all of the meals was different. Perhaps a light snack or even a Snickers before going? Also not sure if they take reservations but the food is tasty and good portions. Floridino's, Spinato's, and Nello's are good competitors."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Called ahead and was told it was 45 minute wait, but there was immediate seating on the patio. Loaded everyone up and went down 10 minutes later and was told patio seating was same as indoor and it would be over an hour. I told them about my call and the 7 hostesses just stared blankly at me and finally one said, \"Are you sure you called this location?\" Because, of course, it has to be my fault. No way one of their folks could have made a mistake. No apologies. No nothing. Will never go to that location again even though it is close to my house. May not ever go to another Oregano's. Their food is fine, but not near as good as a lot of the new pizza places opening downtown. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"When you go to a new Oregano's, you have to expect there to be a line. Some of the employees are lacking the polished organizational skills that we hope for, but this Oregano's is essentially like any other: a stylish joint with a jazzy vibe, charismatic waiters/waitresses, and a delicious selection of the American and Italian variety.

Now that it's been open a few months, the wait times are dwindling each day. I went there opening week and waited an hour and a half. Four weeks ago I waited an hour. Two weeks ago, forty-five minutes. Last week, five minutes (that was for lunch, but still impressive).

As you can tell, I love Oregano's because it's freaking Oregano's, which makes my opinion rather skewed in its favor. But wait times aside, I've had good to great service every visit and consistently tasty food. Not to mention the to-die-for pizzookies-- quite possibly the best thing in the universe."}
{"text":"Showed up to order food to go. Hostess was super helpful. Person taking to-go orders made sure I had all the plasticware & utensils I needed, & also warned me about how spicy my pasta would be. Got a beer while I waited, bartender was super prompt. Pretty sure they grated fresh Parmesan on my to go food--classy."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries here are my absolute favorite. I got the sausage and peppers, and thought it tasted good, but didn't have very many peppers or onions. The servers weren't very attentive, though. Our server did an okay job, but there was a group of three of them standing right by our table talking about how they don't like their job and making plans for the night, which was a little awkward. Overall, I would return, but I might try a different location."}
{"text":"They serve sweet potatoe fries here! Don't let their name throw you because they have sandwiches and subs. Their pizzas are pricier than most local pizzerias because they make it when you order it. I don't recommend getting the pizza unless you want to wait awhile. Their sandwiches are good and less expensive compared to their pizza."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was bad! Unfortunately a $600 takeout order was submitted about the same time our group came in! The manager explained that because of the size of the order it basically was more important! He didn't say it exactly like that but that's the way it came out. It took about an hour to receive our food!

The food was really good when we did finally receive it! We were starving so it tasted great!"}
{"text":"The \"Big Rig\" Pasta calls my name more often than I'd like. Living close to this much delicious pasta and deep dish pizza is rough on the waist line. Always great service, especially outside at the bar."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, especially the thin crust pizza and pizookie! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the wait is super long unless you go before or after dinner rush. Try the Carryout if the wait is too long :)"}
{"text":"Went in a couple weeks ago with my husband a little after lunch hour, so we were seated immediately.  Service was fast and friendly. 

Food is good, but WAY too big (not always a bad thing).  I ordered the ribeye sandwich with waffle fries and a glass of wine. Had a great experience.  
Patio was nice, but there were flies everywhere.  1 or 2, I get it it's outdoors, but when you see them swarming in and out and all around you it gets a little gross.  So, if that bothers you then I'd recommend sitting indoors.  Dining outdoors at night is better."}
{"text":"The service was horrible.  The food is good, but when your upset about how crappy the service is and how long you have to wait for every single item the food just doesn't make up for it.  Also I was designated driver so my husband ask for a second cocktail, they refused to sell, said it is a family establishment and your only allowed 1.  Defiantly will not be our date night spot."}
{"text":"Good customer service. Haven't been in a long time and some of the items have changed in small but significant ways such as the bread and type of cheese on the veggie weggie sandwich. Still good but not as good as in the past v"}
{"text":"Amazing! 

All food is A+

Don't go there to watch a game as there is no TV"}
{"text":"The wait....was forever. Now for the food. We had the stuffed pizza with sausage, pepperoni, and bacon. It was not bad for the price but, don't fool yourself itsnot as good as true Chicago style, or even Unos for that matter. Also order early, we waited an hour to get in, then an hour to get the pizza. ALL in ALL not, bad, not great."}
{"text":"Seems like we are here at least once a week. Just flat out good food and service. They know how to take care of the guest when it is right and also when it is wrong. I just cant seem to get away from the Big Beef sandwich it just calls my name every time......."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for a very long time, usually service is very good and so is the food. Not today though; 10 minutes before anyone asked me if I wanted anything to drink, 5 minutes till I got the drink. 25 minutes for my food to arrive and it was wrong. Would think in 25 minutes they could have at least gotten that right. The place wasn't overly busy as when I looked around to see if it was I saw several servers just standing at tables talking to customers for several minutes at a time. This tells me they felt it wasn't too busy so they could spend extra time chatting up customers. Hopefully this was just an off day for everyone working there."}
{"text":"The food and service are amazing. My brother has a special order and they make it perfectly. One of my family's favorite restaurants. I love the pizzia cookie."}
{"text":"The food and service are amazing. My brother has a special order and they make it perfectly. One of my family's favorite restaurants. I love the pizzia cookie."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome service. Great Price. Scottsdale treasure!"}
{"text":"Our time in Phoenix was limited, or we would have returned. Their menu is quite extensive. We shared a lunch special of deep dish pizza, and added a Caesar salad (to share). A beer, and an iced tea, and we were stuffed! Huge lunch for two at $19. including tax... nice! Oh, by the way... the pizza is very good."}
{"text":"Our server was great, attentive and personable!! You dont find that much these days so that is why im complimenting this location.  We ordered a beef something salad (AMAZING!), chicago pan pizza (takes 45 min. btw), and my FIRST EVER pizza-cookie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! how on earth did it take me so long to get one? I dont know... I have discovered a new vice and that is the pizza cookie!! My only drag about this place is how they dont take reservations... which is lame to me since the waits are always so long * we got sat right away last night though!!  Im just SAYING- they should take reservations.  Oregano's and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"This is really good pizza.  There will be a wait and parking is difficult to find.  But I love, love, love the thin crust pizza here.  My friend always has the lasagna and raves about it, but I have not tried it yet."}
{"text":"Despite the 15 minute wait for two people the service was really awesome not sure if the busy crowd mistakenly made for a bad visit the pizza was a little less than what I expected however they made up for it with their customer service first time guests I reviewed 3 stars"}
{"text":"The pizza is ok but not great.  I have never been really impressed the salads are actually great but they should really work on the pizza.  I visited in the first week it opened so I won't make any comments about the service.  I'm sure it will get better with time."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Their salads are awesome. I get take out frequently and they always get my order correct."}
{"text":"Really not impressed with the food here. I expected it to be much better considering they are always busy. Portions are good size but pasta was dripping in oil and lacking flavor.  Doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant! All of the food is great. Rarely ever order a salad but the Pablo Picasso is great! Good drinks as well! Been going here for years to multiple locations including flagstaff."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! Everything is amazing. Pizza is perfect and the pasta is delicious! Pat is the best and will take excellent care of you!"}
{"text":"Poor design!!!! Restaurant can hold over 100 people and you have a bathroom with only one toilet!!!"}
{"text":"It's always very busy so this isn't your best choice if you're in a hurry.  I've only eaten here at lunch so I don't know what dinner service is like.

The \"Heck of Slice\" is usually what I order. It's fast and a great value.  The pizza is nice Chicago-style with a crisp crust and tangy sauce.

The Pizza Cookie is a tasty desert but since it's usually shared (it's made from a 1/2 pound of cookie dough) it gets messy looking fast.

Parking at this location can be a real pain, and I'd recommend going right when they open at 11am if you want to minimize all the hassles that come with a very popular place."}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust pizza, salads & cookie/ice cream dessert!  So glad to have this location on the West side of town.  We'll have to try pasta next time."}
{"text":"I don't know why I allowed myself to be convinced to go here again.  the servers are nice, and it's cute... but the food is just Not Good.  Blah garlic bread; terrible lasagna; pizza better than Domino's, I guess.... at least the salad was fresh if unremarkable.  Why bother?"}
{"text":"Wait is too long, 2 hours is unreasonable to wait before even being seated. Music is obnoxiously loud, have to shout to talk. Friendly enough staff, but could benefit from better customer service training. Can't comment on pizza, supposed to be good but couldn't keep waiting the two times I tried to visit this weekend. Hope work out issues during soft opening."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service and great drinks. Garlic cheese bread is out of this world and wings are a savory delight!"}
{"text":"Have been going to oreganos for years now, have always loved the food and atmosphere, my last visit was taken to the next step by the amazing service and hard working attitude Aries showed, I have seen him at the Oregano's before but not only did he make sure our food came out perfectly but he did it all, I watched him bus tables, run food, all while making the guests feel appreciated when he could, will definitely be visiting more often because of him!"}
{"text":"Oregano's came highly recommened to us. Being from New York, its hard for me to say pizza anywhere is good 
The pizza was salty I could barey eat it. My fiance and I shared a small salad which was good, typical salad ok whatever but the pizza looked like thin crust from dominos?? That being said I dont get all the raving reviews? Its typical chain food...
On a positive note our server was very sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"To echo others' reviews, it took me 3 tries to actually sit down here as there was at least an hour wait each time. (Fortunately, See's Candies is right next door to this location). As a picky New Yorker, I'm not a fan of their pizza. Crust is too soft, sauce tastes canned. Fun place for happy hour, however, and their customer service is OUTSTANDING (the reason for two stars). I wish the food was better..."}
{"text":"Cons:
Pizza was burnt and not that great, the crust tasted dry and crunchy
The dressings that came with the salads were disgusting! Full of random chunky food scraps.      (we had 3 different dressings) pieces of broccoli and kale etc were in the dressing cups. Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is.
All 5 of us had terrible stomach aches that evening, not sure if it was because we ate so much salad or what. Makes me nervous to return. 

Pros:
Comfortable seating at a table
VERY nice and helpful waiters and staff - they nicely turned down the pumping music so we   could hear each other
Food was very quick coming out of the kitchen"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by my recent visit to Oreganos. The food was actually very good, but the service and level of professionalism was horrible. I went with a group and the wait staff and manager were very rude. We were  ready for a fun night and unfortunately this experience put a huge damper on the evening. I would not recommend this place for any group, EVER. I would put zero stars if possible. When I spoke with the Manager she said she would discount the bill, however when I looked at the bill closer I realized she had discounted the bill, but also added a 20% gratuity for a party of 5, when I asked her to remove the gratuity and keep the discount she refused.  Manger, Cher (I think that was her name), thanks for not handling this appropriately, I will be sending a letter to your corporate office."}
{"text":"Can I just bring my family here everyday!  The food and service was awesome.  I can't think of a single thing I would change about this experience.  Please open some in Southern California!"}
{"text":"How can you not love this place. I wish we had one closer to home to supplement my fattening diet. The delicious \"Guac-a-Tony\" avocado dip, Italian style, served with thin crispy pizza crust was almost enough of a meal for the three of us. We added a deep dish with fresh veggies on top and it was chunky and simply dreamy.

I drop off one star for one reason only... no Happy Hour... Guys there are 70 other places to eat within walking distance and you need to at least offer a buck off draft or something. To think you are above the economy is suicidal. People like me SEEK happy hour pricing because we like to feel we're getting the best value."}
{"text":"I really like it and I am a pizza snob.  The main thing is the crust on the thin crust pizza was awesome.  Had a great outdoor seating area and the staff was friendly.  The fact that they were all hot chicks from ASU helped."}
{"text":"I visited AZ recently and my friends told me I had to try this place so, I went in and sat at the bar. I was greeted by the bartender David who gave me some recommendations for my first visit. I ended up getting the numero one-o, which was delicious! David was running around like crazy in the bar,  but was always attentive to each guest he talked to, cracking jokes and making everyone laugh. Food was amazing, atmosphere is great, and the service was exceptional! Loved my first experience there and will definitely be recommending it to others!"}
{"text":"I walked in to have lunch and it was busy. It took 50 minutes for the thick crust pizza, so I ordered a thin crust. It was spicy and the portions are small. The waiter is the only good thing about this place."}
{"text":"Oregano's is within walking distance to our house and so it's a weekly staple for us.  Surprisingly, we don't go for the pizza!  We go for the salads.  Yep, you can eat healthy here (although I must admit...the garlic cheese bread and pastas surrounding you will make it difficult and call your name, tempting you to order them or reach over and steal a bite of someone's food!).  I think we have actually only sat at a table one time.  We always scoot on up to the bar to eat.  No wait, friendly bartenders and fast service right there next to soooo many good beers on tap.  The Oregano's favorite is MY favorite salad.  I always get it with chicken.  Hubby likes the classic chicken ceasar salad.  Both are always made fresh and not sure what they do to the chicken, but it melts in your mouth and is soooo delicious.  

Occasionally we will \"splurge\" and eat something outside the salad \"zone\".  If/when you do that, go for the garlic cheese bread with marinara sauce.  I could eat 10 of those in one sitting (even though it would be \"carbocide\" - hahahaaha!!).  The pizza is pretty good but I find it very salty.  The wings (on the appetizer menu) are also delicious and I love that all of them are drumsticks, so you never get ripped off with the little wings that other places seem to give you more of.  All drummies here!  

Everyone here is friendly and it's a must go when in Chandler.  Keep up the good work, Oregano's."}
{"text":"if you like long lines this is the place for you.....ok pizza, price is kinda high.  
I came in to eat at 845 one night, they were still full inside and close at 9. we had planned to sit at the bar get a pizza and go home. 
Well the hostess says we r closed so i said i thought u close at 9 and she said well its almost 9. so we left and have not been back since."}
{"text":"I got the deep dish pizza and the garlic bread and it was really delicious. Good quality and a nice quantity of food too. Plus the restaurant is filled with retro pictures, music, and ads - lots of fun!"}
{"text":"Went there around 12:30 on a Monday. Was seated within 5 minutes. Outstanding service and fabulous mea!. Had the cookie and ice cream dessert. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Went here about a year and a half ago with my parents on one of our final nights in Phoenix and we weren't disappointed.  My sister went there a few nights beforehand and recommended it to us after she went there with some friends who live in the area.  I don't know what the new location is like, but would definitely go again if in the area."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  We get the Grandma G's pizza and margaritas every time we go.  The only downside to Oregano's is the noise and wait.  I have never seen the wait shorter than 45 minutes and there is very little space to wait in.  It's also very loud.  But the food makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"Has to be brand new as I've never seen it heading up to Cave Creek before.  It's funny as it almost feels like a chain restaurant in Cave Creek, but not in Phoenix.  Great staff and service as you find at every Oreganos.  Pizza was perfect and as always the Beefstro salad was our favorite.  This location has a better, more wide open patio than most and wasn't as crazy busy yet as the rest.  On a Thursday night our wait was only 15 minutes.  They had a sling for the baby to rest in and seem to have better beers on tap than they used to.  Lagunitas IPA was a plus as we had just finished up at the Farmers Market and in need of a beer.  Will definitely be back when out in Cave Creek or craving Oreganos without the hour wait for a table."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks I had the big rig pasta with sausage, delicious !! The pasta was well seasoned. My sever was very friendly he had great personality. l liked the classic margarita. Will def stop back in for lunch :-)"}
{"text":"Disgusted AND offended.

Being originally from New York, I'm typically pretty picky when it comes to my Italian cuisine. But GOODNESS, I can't even believe this is considered edible. It was disgusting. The entire dining experience was by far the worst I've seen in a long time.

I went in and sat alone, I live right down the road so I was kind of excited to see if there was any chance I could have a place to go when I need to order a pizza. Well gosh, I was wrong.

I stood at the doorway for quite a while, the dining room was basically empty, so I'm not sure why it took so long to acknowledge me. The waitress seated me and then left me unattended for about 12 minutes. As a waitress myself, I know that's uncalled for. 

I ordered a Chicago thin styled pizza: their Margarita with half Pepperoni. It took THIRTY minutes for them to bring it out. And when it arrived, it was burnt on the bottom. It was clear and evident that they do NOT use fresh ingredients. I can't even believe that they could CLASSIFY it as a \"Margarita\", I was completely appalled. It was diced tomatoes, regular shredded cheese with SHREDDED lettuce, I don't even think it was basil, to be honest. It looked horrendous and the taste was just the same.

Once receiving my pizza, the waitress flat out ignored me. I ran out of water and didn't even finish my pizza. I got home and immediately felt sick to my stomach. I ended up throwing up all night, and calling in sick to work. I OVERPAID and I lost hours at work.


Good job Oregano's, for taking advantage of the fact that people out here DO NOT know REAL Italian food... You do NOT have me fooled. Repulsive. This is the most angry review I have ever written."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place; generous amounts of really good food. We sat outside where the misters were going and enjoyed the lights and feeling part of nighttime Scottsdale. The waitress was attentive, friendly, and efficient, even tho she said it was only her second day solo. I had a salad with pasta and chicken that I can't wait to go back for. I got the smaller version but still couldn't eat it all. My husband ate every bite if his lasagna and said it was delicious. My son loved his pesto pasta (not the first time he's had it!), but had half of it left to take home. Don't miss Oregano's; it's a reasonably priced meal not to be missed in Scottsdale, but go HUNGRY!"}
{"text":"I have been to other Oregano's locations (South Tempe, Downtown Tempe and South Chandler) and have always had a very good experience.  This time I visited the Oregano's on Camelback and was pretty disappointed.  There were four of us at lunchtime.  Had to park on the street because the small lot was full.  No worries, that does not bother me really.  We were seated pretty quickly.  Ordered Lawrence's Original Pizza (my favorite there) as well as an Antipasto salad.  The pizza was good but took forever to arrive.  The salad was terrible and I had been so looking forward to it.  I may give them another chance at this location, but there are so many interesting places on my list to visit, it will probably not be for a long time."}
{"text":"Yummy! I went there with my husband last night after I had completely destroyed our dinner (whoops!). I was in such a terriblel mood before we got there, but the atmosphere (especially in their outside dining area) was awesome and definitely helped met get into a better mood. The host and waitresses were super friendly and the food, while ginormous, was delicious. 

We will definitely be going back another time.

...and you need to get the Pizza Cookie! Seriously, it's imperative!"}
{"text":"I just celebrated my birthday at Oregano's.  I had the best server I have had the pleasure of meeting in a lonnnnng time.  ASK FOR ALEXANDRA.  Knowledgable, adorable!, attentive, funny, and charming to boot!  Amazing pizza and salad, fab cocktails we'd never heard of, and to-die-for dessert.  All per her recommendations.  Can't wait to come here again."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour to be seated just to see people who got here after us get a table...yeah the girl crossed us off the list for no reason. Noobs at the bar left us waiting to pay for the drinks we got while we were waiting, and then when we finally get seated guess what, it's another hour wait for our pizza.... Could have told us that before the first hour!!! Save yourself the 2 hours of waiting and go to Pizza Hut, you'll be much less dissatisfied. I would give this place zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Ordered the vegitarian sandwich and it was absolutly disgusting. The eggpant was greasy and tasted like it was old and had just come out of the refridgerator. After one bite I sent the sandwich back. The waitor appologized and said they would be making me a fresh sandwich and that it was not supposed to be cold. I already knew this as I had just had this sandwich less than a week ago at their bell rd and 67th ave location (it was delicious there). The new sandwich comes out and it is hot so I dig in. First bite was much better but then back to cold eggplant. I look at the other half of the sandwich under the fries and behold, the original bite I had taken... So they did not remake the sandwich and just re-heated the whole thing. I gave them the opportunity to make it right the first time and they chose to give me back a reheated old sandwich vs making a new one with fresh ingredients.  You have now lost a customer."}
{"text":"Scottsdale's best pizza, really good service want go back for more. We bought all the T-shirts we could, for keepsakes , it was a really good place to be.  Want to go back for more.!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the lunch special Mini-Pizza while traveling through Tempe.  It was too salty.  Not pleasant.  The ambiance was very noisy.  The service was slow.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant about 4 times now since I moved here 3 months ago! Great service and delicious food. If you're looking for pasta, I recommend the big rig pasta. If you like spicy, try the el diablo shrimp pasta-it definitely has a kick to it! The thin crust pizzas are great as well. Last time I went there I ordered brushetta authentic for the appetizer...it was a little too salty for me, but other than that, everything was just right!  Will be going back again."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having lunch today at this restaurant. Our server, Jason, was the best. The food was delivered quickly, hot and delicious.  The Parmesan Chicken with Angel Hair was great. The desert, hot cookie topped with ice cream and chocolate chips was excellent."}
{"text":"Yet another restaurant has removed a delicious vegetarian item from its menu.  You can no longer get a green chili pizza from this Oreganos.  C'mon man!  It's not that hard to keep a can of green chilies on the shelf!"}
{"text":"Today's visit was a 3 star only because out kick butt garlic bread was a little off. We have had it many times and today it smelled and tasted a little sour. The food is normally spot on so it was a bit of a shocker."}
{"text":"Taylor and Tammy sue took great care of us! This was my first time at Oreganos and I will definitely be back, the food was great but the customer service was exceptional. I work in hospitality so it's nice to go out on a Saturday night and receive good service! Very impressed!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with oreganos and this location is no exception. Solid food, good service, and a fantastic atmosphere. My family and I love eating here."}
{"text":"We had Oregano's cater a party at our home. Jane the head of catering was amazing to work with and the staff  they sent to our home were great. The food was delicious as always and they made the party a hit. Everyone really enjoyed themselves!"}
{"text":"\"So fun and family friendly - Recommend for any occasion, and special occasions!\"

Oregano's has always been a Valley favorite. Since moving a few blocks south on Scottsdale Road to expand their location and parking, I have really enjoyed the huge patio, indoor/outdoor bar, and - of course - their amazing pizza, drinks, atmosphere, and service!

I celebrated a birthday there, and our waiter was truly impeccable - with a party of 7-8 - and my eccentric family, he couldn't have been more accommodating, impeccable with all drink/food orders, and went out of his way to make it SUCH a special evening for me.

I love this location!!! Very special attention, accommodating staff always willing to assist and very polite, and consistently awesome food. What more can you ask for?!?!

{"text":"Awesome pizza in a pleasantly great  atmosphere  Short and Sweet! By far some of the best pizza I have ever had in my many travels across the United States!  Definitely WORTH a trip and a MUST to the scottsdale az"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and had a great experience.  Kevin was our waiter and was fantastic.  We had a large group with multiple checks and he handled it very smoothly.  Food was really good, drinks were refilled quickly, overall very impressed."}
{"text":"I have been to Oregano's on several occasions when my son was a bit younger. He loved making his own pizza, but I never really found anything all that spectacular about the food. However, tonight we decided to give it a try because Dave wanted a deep dish. We arrive a little after 9 and by the time we were seated and had a chance to look at the menu, it was 9:30.  We ordered a deep dish and a salad. The server promptly told us that they took over an hour to make(They closed at 10) . You would think that might be listed on the menu, but it wasn't. He was nice about it and we decided to see if there was something else we wanted; however, I knew Dave really wanted the deep dish so I told him to get it, they said it was fine. (We like to respect the closing times of businesses, if you close at 10, then you want your customers gone and to move on with your day, you don't want to be hanging around). We decided it would be ok and we ordered the deep dish,. This time the server informed us it was 80% cheese, and if we wanted more meat than cheese to go with the Pan Style over the Deep Dish, and by the way, the Pan style also takes an hour to make. We decided we did want the pan and we ordered. I also got the House Special salad.

The salad was good, the pizza was really good and while it might not come through in the text here, the service was really good. We really like it when the servers tell us what is good and what is just ok, that is part of our dining experience.  We could tell this guy was being honest and really wanted us to enjoy our experience here. This alone moved this review to 4 stars. 

Now here is the bad: Almost every location is on a wait during dinner, almost every day of the week; if a pizza takes an hour to make...don't you think you should list that on the menu? These guys have always impressed me with their witty marketing, so I was really mad I had to wait an hour for my pie! Secondly, the waiter also told me people will typically call ahead and place their Pan or Deep Dish order and then come in about 30 minutes later and tell the hostess they placed their order and decided to eat it there, skipping the wait and the line. Now your promoting Bad Consumer behavior and these same people get to cut in line because they called in? How is that fair to the people that are sitting there for an hour or so waiting for a table? 

I would only give these guys 2 stars for all the dishes I have had and didn't care for, I never found them all that flavorful or original; however, the Pan pizza was good and the service excellent for customers that closed the restaurant, so they get bumped this time around. Unfortunately, I doubt we will go back anytime soon because it will take an hour for our pizza and we won't be one of those BAD customers that decides to call ahead and skip the wait."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, waitress was very friendly, and portion sizes huge! Plan on sharing everything you order. Don't leave without ordering the chocolate chip cookie! I can see why it's voted best in the valley."}
{"text":"I know the food is great, but having to wait one hour and thirty five minutes for our food, and then have it be wrong...not the best of service. (All after waiting for 45 minutes to be seated) Then telling conflicting stories to excuse the ridiculous tardiness of the food is no way to treat customers! 
--I won't be back. To those who have hours to kill and aren't concerned about when your food comes or if the order is right, then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"So excited to have an Oregano's up north, great lunch and Katherine the bartender is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent oreganos customer, however I usually go to the one on Elliot. This was my first time at this location and was not impressed. I'm only giving 2 stars because the food was still great as usual, however, the service was not. We arrived around 9pm and was put on a 20 minute wait. The hostess was very nice to us and sat us in a booth. Our waiter was named Anthony. We were rushed through our entire meal and we could tell he just wanted us to leave. Shortly after we just got our entree, he put to go boxes on our table, making us feel even more rushed. He was not friendly to us at all and we felt uncomfortable. After our meal, we got a pizookie and when it came out, the ice cream was very obviously melted. While we were still eating it, he came over and assumed we were done and started to clear our plates and took our unfinished pizookie before we could get a word in. He then brought us the receipt and quickly left before we could show them a birthday coupon for a free pizookie. When we finally got a chance to show him, he rudely said that we should've shown him before (even though he gave us the receipt before we were done). Overall a bad experience with the server, but the hostess and the kitchen did a great job."}
{"text":"Food is always abundant.. I just really really wish it didn't take 40 mins to get an eggplant parmesan and meatball sandwich. Sadly, as much as I want to love it, I think we will pass next time to head to somewhere we can eat without such a long lag time."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how to rate this since I'm so conflicted. We went for the first time on a Tuesday afternoon. We were impressed with the decor and the waitstaff was extraordinary. We ordered lasagna and spaghetti. We started with a garlic cheesebread appetizer that was AMAZING. SO...off to a good start. Next We got lasagna and Spaghetti. That's where it all went wrong. The lasagna was completely inedible for both my husband and I. The herbs and spices were extremely strong and neither one of us could eat it. It was filled with some spicy sausage that didn't appeal to either of us. We did not find one noodle in there, and no stringy cheese. Now, I have to preface by saying that my husband and I pretty much like bland very ordinary food and this was out of the ordinary for us. The spaghetti was pretty much the same but not quite as strong. We didn't like either dish. Our waitress was amazing though and offered to sub out for us. Would I come back and try something else? Maybe the salad our neighboring table had that was as big as his whole head!  Definitely get the cheese bread if you go.  Please don't let our experience keep you from trying this very popular place -- we just like things a little less spicy which is a personal preference."}
{"text":"We love this place! The service is always amazing as well as the food. The only bad fall is the wait, which I can see why they are always on one. You can't go wrong with any of their selections."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Service was fantastic, staff so very friendly. Garlic chicken lasagna was delicious and has now become my favorite pasta dish. Loved the ambiance and the music they played (1940's) really set the mood. Really wish there was one in Colorado!!"}
{"text":"Oreganos is the best place for italian food (besides my grandmothers cooking),  and the ice cream cookie never gets old! Every time I've gone here, the service has been awesome. The servers are very attentive and friendly plus give give good recommendations for trying new things. I have never been a spicy person until i tried the Diablo shrimp entree. Soooo good! The only thing that needs work is the attentiveness of the bar, otherwise perfect!"}
{"text":"Jessica is the best server made great recommendation on food dan was awesome as we'll first time here recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Oregano's! Each time I go there no matter what time there is always a 30 minute wait!  I cannot enjoy your deliciousness when I am hungry and do not want to look at my shoes for 30 minutes. I do not have the luxury of an iPhone to pass the time. Build more tables? 
Very enjoyable place, staff is kind, food is..Oregano's."}
{"text":"More of a review on an employee and the location than oreganos... I love Oreganos food and I'm new to this location so it was a disappointing first try for them.
I called in my order since my husband was in the area and I'm home getting kids to sleep. Someone named Diva answered and was very friendly in taking my order. She got my phone number and my husbands name since he was picking it up. Then I called my husband and told him order was in. He was there 15 minutes later, a little earlier than the wait time we were given. He spoke to Diva, who took my order on the phone. Only, she didn't have the order? It was lost? She acted clueless to me having placed an order. Asked if it was placed at the correct location (obviously it wasn't, Diva) and couldn't find it... My husband had to order all over again, but that also meant waiting 30 extra minutes when the point of calling in was that it would be close to ready upon arrival! Very annoying. There was no apology or effort made to make up for this mistake. My husband already had a long day and didn't want to sit and wait for our order for 30 minutes due to their mistake. 

Foods alright. It tastes a lot better when you are able to eat it in a good mood. The paradise valley location is better. I've had many meals ordered to go there that weren't lost either."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've been going to different Oregano's in the valley for close to 10 years. I'm never disappointed when I try something new. Anything from the pasta, pizza, salad, wings, even the soup tastes amazing. I recommend the Pablo Picasso salad and the Alfredo the Dark with Chicken. If you're still hungry after that (which isn't likely) you can never go wrong with their pizza cookie! My only complaint is the wait during their busy times. My solution is to go for a late weeknight dinner when we can be seated as soon as we walk in."}
{"text":"If you have never dined here it is a must at least once. The pizzas are excellent and the salads are very good. But you must top off with a pazooki ."}
{"text":"We dined there Friday night & ate on the patio. I ordered the portobello thick pizza. Waiter advised 30 min wait so I switched to regular crust. Bad mistake, flat burned crust with no flavor. The portobello mushrooms were non existent with a few other mushrooms thrown in. Husband ordered angel hair & sausage. Took one bite & left the rest. When the waiter was delivering the check he noticed only one bite was missing. Then proceeded to tell us how spicy the sausage was. That info would have been most helpful when he ordered. That was our first & last visit. Rosemary"}
{"text":"After calling in to get some to-go food (and dealing with their illogical \"time-slot\" pick up schedule) I ordered their Chicken Parm Pasta, which was described as \"a huge free range Chicken breast\"...they might need to either alter that, or look up the word huge.  I could barely find what looked like a small, pounded half of a chicken breast under the   mound of mozzarella.  More cheese than chicken, by a fair margin.

On the up side, the employees were their usual happy selves, and that is one reason to go to this location.  I am usually a big fan of the food, but maybe I hit the one menu item that does not live up to the hype.  Love the Big Rig, love the pizza, Chicken Parm pasta....take it or leave it.  I chose the latter."}
{"text":"Love these guys!  Usually the Thin crust Bistro Classic with chicken or the thin crust Chicken Pesto.  Amazing food all the time!"}
{"text":"Normally a favorite of mine, this Oregano's has gone off a cliff.  The service has been incredibly slow.  We arrived before it got busy, no one else was on the patio yet.  We ordered off the lunch \"rush\" menu and it took 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered.  The patio has a very strong and horrible sewer smell.  I ordered the alfredo pasta which I love and is normally very creamy but this time was soupy.  This was the second try, had the exact same experience a month ago."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, and great service. A tiny bit expensive, but not too much. I love the meatball and the pizza crust appitizer thing. There are also salad options and non tomato pizza options too"}
{"text":"Had a good experience when my wife and I sat at the bar. Great pizza and wings. 

However, we tried to go recently with a larger group (8 people) and it was 1.25 hr wait. At 5pm on a Wednesday... Riiiiight.  

I tried to call ahead and they don't accept call aheads. They apparently only have 1 table capable of seating larger parties. Kinda missed the mark on that one Oreganos. Brand spankin new building and all. 

So we went across the street to Native NewYorker and got seated immediately."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time yesterday and I loved it! Nice atmosphere and service was very good. Had a whole wheat pasta lasagna and garden salad with house vinagarette dressing. Both were delicious! The garlic bread served with the lasagna was fantastic! I will definately be back again!"}
{"text":"If you live in the Cave Creek area this is a welcome restaurant addition to the town.  It's busy all the time.  The food is good, and the servers really try hard to manage things.  It is like a locally owned Olive Garden   Don't expect haute  cuisine, just a tasty Italian meal that more than fills you up"}
{"text":"Love this place! best patio when its not hot lol! the staff very helpful and the foods on point!"}
{"text":"Great service friendly staff! I have taken my elderly grandma and the servers are very help full. The foods perfect and the wait is never more than 15min!"}
{"text":"Oreganos is always good for what it is; family dining and big portions.

SOMEONE PLEASE TURN THE MUSIC DOWN. Please. Please sweet baby Jesus turn it down. Trumpets blaring in my face make conversation impossible here"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The atmosphere was great & the food was even better. Meat balls were to die for and margarita pizza with light and refreshing! Wish they had these on the west coast!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service as always! This store is my favorite Oregano's. Going on Friday night prime time as I did, you should expect a wait, but the wait is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in the Phoenix area! Walked in and in and immediately fell in love with the vintage charm of the restaurant! Server was very nice and attentive and the pizza was great! Even ordered a another slice to take home to eat the next day! I would come here any day!"}
{"text":"For all around value and experience: Just went to lunch to meet some girlfriends and loved it so much I brought my husband back the next day.  It's a complete dining experience including not only the food but the way it is laid out with booths and round tables, decorated with antiques, italian music playing, amazing friendly culture that made me feel special.  They want to make sure you are completely happy and the prices are very reasonable.  I wanted the shimp pasta made with spinach instead of pasta, my waitress thought I meant the shrimp salad.  The kitchen manager delivered the salad and without even a hesitation, gladly took the salad back and brought me what I wanted.  He even said he would make a crustless pizza for me since I have to be gluten free.  The first day I had the beef salad and it was too hot for me, they took it back and made it without any jalapenos and it was delicious, the meat was tender and it was huge.  I thought that was above and beyond because the waiter did warn me and I still ordered it so technically it was my fault."}
{"text":"Holy crap do these employees understand the word hurry we have been waiting here for 2 hours for a table then when it's ready it takes 30 min to get it cleaned worst employees ever"}
{"text":"This place is Great, but, you do have to go early.  At least by 4pm on weekends, any Oregano's in the Valley is this way, that shows how good they are.  This was our 2nd time here at this location and the staff is very friendly and attentive.  The food is amazing, we always have our usual, starting off with the \"Oregano's Favorite Salad\", along with the \"Bistro Calamari\"  then the finale of the \"Puerto Penasco Carne Street Pie\".  We always leave with a nice leftover package.  We are so HAPPY to have 
Oregano's in this part of the Valley."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. I absolutely love the food here and the atmosphere. Staff is great with greetings and farewells. I visit here no more than maybe once every two weeks but no less. They keep it cool inside so keep a jacket handy! Servers are always super friendly with their service and are always professional. 

I do have my favorites that are a must-see! Nate the manager is fabulous. Takes care of me just like a server would. Literally can walk by your table and offer to fill your water for you and check up on you. Wonderful service. 

And actual server I must recommend is Miguel. I have had him serve me on majority of my visits. He's so great and sweet and never forgets a thing. Always friendly and talkative. 

This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients.  Place was really hopping and service was awesome."}
{"text":"Best pizza in scottsdale and has a great theme"}
{"text":"I know this is a first come first serve place with no reservations however on FB their own site said I could call and ask what would be a good time to come in for a party of 8 ... I called and the answer was \"get here as soon as you can\" so I get there at 5pm for a 6:30 dinner and there is zero wait, so I ask if we could sit at a 2-seat table and order some drinks while we wait the hour and a half for our party, the answer \"no\" even though there are empty tables everywhere ... I changed the dinner party to Z'TEGAS :D they took care of all of us :D"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food at Oreganos but after my visit last night, I am disappointed.   I have been to this location many times.  All the food looks amazing but I always stick with ordering a pizza and wings.  The wings in the past have always been huge, cooked well, and the medium gold sauce is fabulous.  Last night, I ordered my usual and was so disappointed when the wings arrived.  They were small, half the size of what they were previously.  While the taste was still good, I was so bummed by the underwhelming size of the wings.   Come on Oreganos!!"}
{"text":"I live near the area & I absolutely love that there is Oreganos here. I have came here a few times and every time we had to wait. The hostess do their best to get everyone in, and out. The servers here are full of energy & always seem awake which I love! Puts everyone in a good environment! The food is good, not amazing, but good. Portions are huge, so I would recommend sharing with a partner."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE Oregano's!  We have come here for years and always have a pleasant experience.  The staff is friendly, the food is great, and the restaurant itself is clean.

Usually this restaurant is very busy, but you can drink while you wait!  Fabulous margaritas, and the best ravioli I have ever had -- it's huge!  Also, the caesar salad is amazing.  The pizza is great, but surprisingly not my favorite since I'm not the biggest fan of the thin-crust variety.  

Finish off the meal with a delicious pizzookie, and you are good to go!  :-)"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I was in town on business and the hotel I was staying st recommended it! Great drinks, great food! I had the chicken parmigiana subbed with angel hair pasta instead of fettuccini noodles. Large portion which was great because I traveled all day and had not really eaten! Will come back again when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with friends, party of 8. Excepted the long wait time as we heard the food was great however after waiting over an hour they tried to seat us in a corner booth (they ended up giving it to a party of four who just fit comfortably). When we advised both the hostess and server it was not acceptable they said hopefully a table would hopefully open in a few minutes and walked away. After 15 minutes or so of all 8 of us standing in the middle of the restaurant being ignored we left. On the way out we every staff member who was aware of the situation said \"have a good night\". It seemed like they didn't care because they knew there would be another party to replace us. Poor customer service! Have no desire to go back as there as so many more places with great food and better respect for those of us who are spending our hard earned money."}
{"text":"Went for a lovely dinner with my boyfriend and some friends a couple weeks ago. One friend gets sick that evening, next day I'm taking my boyfriend to the hospital to see if his appendix is bursting or if it's food poisoning. Guess what? It's food poisoning. He called the restaurant to tell them what happened, and despite their claim that they take all reports of food poisoning \"seriously\" they called back and told us nothing was wrong in the kitchen, when clearly something was amiss that night. Didn't even bother to offer us a refund on our food. You've officially lost me forever, Oregano's. I love your food and I will miss it, but I have to take a stand against treating your customers this way. My family and I regularly go to Oregano's on special occasions - my birthday, my mother's birthday, and my anniversary are all coming up in April. Guess where we won't be going?"}
{"text":"If eating a pizza cookie is wrong, I don't want to be right.

Oregano's in Scottsdale is a fantastic, fun place to get some Italian food in a relaxed atmosphere, maybe while catching a ballgame on the TV.

There's a pizza pie for everyone regardless of your preference - deep dish, thin crust, original, you name it. Do yourself a favor and get the guacamole. Holy Moly! I could have survived on that alone.

The wait stuff are young and fun, and I even did something I never do at a restaurant - I bought a T-shirt. A baseball jersey-style Oregano's shirt that remains one of my favorite tees.

Sidle up to the bar if that's your thing, you'll get great service, conversation, and of course, food. or bring a date and enjoy pizza, lasagna, spaghetti, you name it.

Parking is sparse and the wait may be a little long (get there early for lunch) but it's well worth it.

I just wish there was an Oregano's near me in Michigan."}
{"text":"My fiance and I looooove this place! We come here often for pasta and dirty monkeys! Andrew and Alan are the absolute best best servers!!"}
{"text":"We went last night with a group of ten, waiting for a table for an hour was ok considering the size of our group but from the time we were seated it just spiraled downhill ending with Adam the kitchen manager calling my husband out to the parking lot! Wow, ive never seen anything like it especially after 2 out of 4 appetizers never came out,  frozen lasagne, and poor drinks, there were other entrees that never came out as well,  this was all after being seated for over an hour. The general manager is lacking the experience to handle this location, we waited an hour to speak with her! We've been to the flagstaff location twice after college graduation and they were swamped to say the least but after being seated they were great dining experiences.......the cave creek location needs to get a grip on what the food service business is about.  \"0\" stars is an apropriate rating,  we will NEVER go back again.....I'd rather starve!"}
{"text":"I was writing a stellar review on Yelp for another restaurant and I was then reminded of the terrible service I received here! Though I love the food here (the El Diablo pasta is my favorite) the service is at best OK and at worst embarrassing to the restaurant. Great food but truly mediocre service."}
{"text":"This was the first time for this location.  The location I go to most often has a history of bad service.  I'm happy to say that this location did not follow suit.  

We went on a saturday evening...no wait to sit outside, was told 20-25 mins for indoor....indoor only turned out to be 10-15.  Everyone was friendly, service was good, and the food was very good....and at a fair price.

They serve traditional Italian dishes, a few Oreganos originals, and have awesome thin crust pizza!  They sport a full bar, so you can have your favorite beer, mixed drink, or wine to wash it all down.

All in all, a nice evening out to dinner."}
{"text":"Good service, great food. They have only been open a few days and everything was great. There was an hour wait but drinks on the patio took care of that. They even came around with pizza samples. We ordered and got our food fairly fast for a new place. The lasagna and pizza were both delicious and we have enough for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews I had decided not to go but a local said I had to try it. Good thing I listened to the local. The food was rockin and plentiful. I ordered a 6'' deep dish and side salad for lunch. I could only finish half of both. The pizza was, let me see- Awesome!  The service was on point so I am guessing the other reviewers just caught them on an off day....give em another try the food is worth it. The only wierd thing was the booths were unusually small so grab a table if at all possible."}
{"text":"Food is OK, portions are huge (perfect for dinner+lunch the next day). Fried raviolis weren't anything to get excited about, but the stuffed turkey sando was good. Friendly staff and casual, cool atmosphere make it a good night with friends. I'd come back to see if dessert lives up to it's reputation"}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  This has to be the absolute worst Italian restaurant in AZ. Really. I tried Oregano's about 3 years ago and didn't like one bit.  After construing to the rave reviews of how good this chain is we thought we'd give another try. Big mistake.  Maybe growing up in an Italian neighborhood back east where every restaurant was \"homemade\", spoiled me.  The pesto bruschetta was fine, but how can you go wrong with bread, cheese and pesto. Cheesy garlic bread is garlic bread. Then the pizza and the angel hair pasta.  A pepperoni thin crust. Still the worst pizza ever eaten. No taste at all. Reminded me of a thin crust frozen pizza.  The marinara on the pasta was terrible as was the pasta itself.  This just confirms that people in the valley truly do not know good Italian food.

Bright spot.  The waitress was absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Ordered Caesars salad  and it was dry as a bone. Asked for more dressing and they charged me for it. The thin crust pizza had VERY little sauce on it and was dry as the Caesar salad. I thought mushrooms on a pizza would be cooked? These were not and cold. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"This stuffed pizza here was the best I've ever had outside of Chicago.  Absolutely amazing...  We also tried the Pesto Pizza and were more than pleasantly surprised to find it exceptionally good too...  I can't comment on the service because it was take out - although everyone was very welcoming and friendly as we walked up for our order."}
{"text":"So, the food here is tasty, but the service is sub par. They totally forgot our menus when seating us, and it took them almost 10 minutes to bring us a high chair. IMMEDIATELY after the high chair appeared the waitress came and asked us if we were ready to order. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the food, it was amazing. But service means something, and they definitely leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent! Excellent thin crust pizzas all the way down to the Bollo pasta - awesome sauce!  Wait staff friendly and outgoing but not rehearsed. If lunch wasn't so packed I'd eat there at least once a week. As it is, I only go if I end up doing a late lunch (after 2)."}
{"text":"The service was horrible! We were quoted a 30-45 minute wait time. At 45 minutes the hostess came out, called our name, but  told us she was checking to make sure we were still there.....we were then told it'd be another 5-10 minutes. My daughter and I then moved closer to the door, the hostess came up 10 minutes later, still no table-but she did ask if we wanted to sit outside, even though I requested inside from the get go. Along with my daughter was my 5 month old granddaughter, so outside was out of the question, I politely declined.Then I was quoted another 10-15 minutes, at this point both my daughter and I were fed up. We had waited over an hour and had seen two couples that arrived when we had leaving already, leftovers in hand. Upset about the even longer wait we placed a to-go order. We were quoted 15-20 minutes. We didn't get our food until 45 minutes later...........As if we hadn't already wasted enough of our time, when we arrived home our pasta seemed to have no sauce!!
I will not be returning to this new location, the service was horrible, not to mention one of the hostesses shirts was way too small and I could see her belly, not appropriate for the work environment. I guess I'll stick to my usual Camelback location."}
{"text":"A good place for a relaxed night out with friends. The pizza is good here and comes in several styles, but do not ignore the rest of the menu. the oregano's fav salad is great, as is the fried ravioli with jalapeno cheese. The entrees are good as well, esp. the chicken lasagna. And, the pizookie (cookie dessert) really is amazing. Who does not love a hot, soft, melty cookie topped with ice cream? 

The atmosphere is very relaxed, the drinks are pretty cheap, and they do not rush you at all. With the outdoor seating (w/ heaters for the winter), this is a great place to meet friends, enjoy some solid food and relax."}
{"text":"As I write this, there are already 109 other reviews, most of which rate this restaurant as highly as possible. Writing this review is much like jumping on the bandwagon, but perhaps you'll read my review and decide to go over for dinner. 
     When I go, I usually go earlier so that I can park in the restaurant lot. Otherwise, there is street parking available and you can get to within a block or two. 
     For years I have been coming here for the thin crust pizza. Order a size larger than you think you'll eat - the crust is so very thin that you can eat more of it before feeling full! This is a very fine thin crust - it will not disappoint you.  
     Over the years I have also sampled many of the pasta dishes. You''ll find them very good, and very generous - but I would recommend the pizza over the pasta.
     Service is attentive, friendly, and swift - a lot of nice folks work here. 
     The pizza/cookie dessert is positively decadent! 
     Bottom line: excellent food, wonderful service, and worth the parking challenge."}
{"text":"I definitely had the best customer service waking in tonight. They turned my night into a good one! The pizza was so bomb.. Love the cheese on it and the sausages. They sure know how to spoil you."}
{"text":"I'm usually a picky pizza eater, as nothing pales in comparison to my favorite Wisconsin pizza joint. But I LOVE Oregano's! It's just about the best place for pizza in Chandler. I love their thin crust pizza piled with toppings. If you're looking for a great place, pick Oregano's. Their patio is heated and wonderful-- summer, spring or winter!

I have yet to even eat inside and I've been there a few times. The wait has never been longer than 15 minutes for my family of four and the service has always been very nice. I know many of the workers (students at Hamilton High) and they have been trained well. The pizza does take a bit to get to you, but it's well worth it. I can usually finish my portion of the pizza, but sometimes I come home with a few slices and it tastes just as amazing the next day!

Definitely the right place for pizza night!"}
{"text":"Best restaraunt in the world, Every time I eat here I am so pleased with the Med-gold wings, pizza, and pesto pasta/ big rig.  

Love the people and service is always great!"}
{"text":"We went in for an early dinner to celebrate my husband's promotion at work. There were only three occupied tables. The manager was nice enough to come out and greet patrons and ask about their dining experience. What surprised me was he didn't stop at our table. I was completely baffled. Why would a manager go down the row to greet the first table next to us, skip our table, then go to the third table next to us? Is it company policy to only greet white guests? I asked him about it and he seemed surprised that he had done that. Perhaps it's so ingrained that he ignore certain customers that he didn't realize it. Luckily, our waiter was more attentive."}
{"text":"The pizza is okay.  I don't get why so many people love this place.  I only go because the consensus wants to.  I usually manage by getting other things besides the pizza such as wings, the wedding soup or a salad.  Yes I have tried several different build your own and specialty thin crust pizzas on their menu.  Yes it is cool that they have a whole grain wheat crust option.  The pizza is crispy and the toppings are fresh but to me it's just okay.  Not great, not bad but acceptable."}
{"text":"Both the food and service are always amazing! There is usually a wait, even on weekdays, but definitely well worth it!"}
{"text":"I am always pleased with our experiences at Oregano's. Food was amazing and service was awsome!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, but its truly a shame how poor the service is. Waited outside for an hour and a half when the wait time was 45 minutes. Several parties that arrived after mine were taken in long before us. Piece of advice: make a reservation!"}
{"text":"This place was a 5+ star due to the outstanding service coupled with solid food quality and quantity. David, our server/bartender, went out of his way to explain the history of the place and make us feel at ease. Great representative for Scottsdale and Oregano's."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings! Sometimes the service is a little bit iffy but for the most part the ambiance and food are really good! Must try thy Pablo Picasso salad!"}
{"text":"Love the patio for wine and chit chat with friends. The food is good and the staff is friendly, most of the time. It always seems to be busy. The wait time can be long. Take out is long as well and it can be pricey. It's a casual and comfortable environment."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza!! We've been in Scottsdale for 4 days and have eaten here two times. Not only is the food great, the atmosphere is as well. I'm very sad that you can't buy their food in Florida."}
{"text":"Always consistently good.  This is a favorite of my boyfriend and I and while he always gets the penne pesto bake, I like to change it up and try something different each time.  Haven't been disappointed yet.  This is one of the only places we get dessert from and it is sinfully delicious, the baked cookie (gooey, chocolatey, soft yuminess), which is covered with vanilla ice cream.  I leave Oregano's with a full, happy belly every time."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch date with daughter and we had the absolute best service on top of always fantastic food! Melissa our server was super friendly, engaged us in conversation, never let us run out of drinks, promptly delivered our food and managed to not make us feel like she was lingering. she even offered us drinks to go and boxed our food for us. On top of it all, the manager (pete, i believe) bought our pizza cookie for absolutely no reason! they made my special lunch date with my daughter that much better! thank you Oregano's, Melissa, and Pete! We will see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Tip for oreganos staff: don't make your customer wait an hour and a half for their order and then get it wrong!!! Thanks for ruining our evening"}
{"text":"Today my family and I went into the restuarant and sat at the bar. We go to this restuarant all the time and it was extremely disappointing the service that we recieved. The bartender that was on took him 10 minutes to come and even greet us and take our drink orders. We asked another girl if she could but her excuse was I can't go behind the bar all we wanted was water and teas I'm pretty sure water and tea isn't only behind a bar. Then it took our bartender another 10 mins to come check on us to see if we wanted to oder any food. I could tell he had his regulars and the entire time he just talked to them and basically stayed away from our end of the bar that we were sitting at. Once our drinks were empty we had to ask a different waiter to grab refills and he said ok but didn't even grab our drinks so we wait another 5 or 6 mins for refills. Then when the bartender came back with the refills his comment was \"sorry I promise I'm mot ignoring you\" if that was the case then why did the 3 of us feel like we were being ignored? My dad is usually a great tipper but when it comes to bad service he won't leave as good of a tip. I was extremely annoyed by how unprofessional our bartender was and how he felt no urgency to check on us at all. This was the worst experience ever and it's sad because we go to this exact restuarant all the time but because of how we were treated we have no intentions on returning any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been here twice at this location. Both times on Wednesday night. The wait is long but not extreme. Can't imagine a wkend night! Sat at the bar once. Bartenders were friendly and attentive. Dined at the table the other time. Food is mediocre/good. Service is good even though it's super busy. Ambience is a little crowded and noisy but all in all.. Not bad but not great. Not my first choice for Italian but will return at some point. 

Note: FREE pizza cookie if you sign up for your birthday on their site. It is delicious if it's cooked properly! We had ours taken back because it was under cooked. The second was still a little under but decided to leave it. Both my boyfriend and daughter had poopy issues later that night. Pretty sure it's the pizza cookie because I only had a bite or two. So be weary of it."}
{"text":"Sloooooooow service, excuses as to why it took over 40 minutes for our food to be served. Found small black flakes in my margarita and once returned I was promptly told by a manager that they couldn't serve margaritas the remainder of the night.  Ummmmm ok??? Won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Arrived and was told it was a hour wait. Fine. After 1 hour and 45 I started inquiring more on how much longer it would take. Was told \"cleaning table now\". Another 30 min passed and I was finally seated. OVER two hour wait after told an hour. :(
Pizza was WEAK! Super dry and very little cheese. Salads were good though. Not up to oregano  standards. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Real good Chicago style pie and pasta dishes. Thin crust style not bad but go with the pan style IMO. Good clean friendly atmosphere. Families, couples, singles, teenagers out for a bite, convivial staff. Overall just a pleasant experience. I highly recommend it for everyone. 
The Chicago style pie is as close to Chicago style pan pizza as one can get without eating at Lou Malnati's in Chicago. Couldn't tell the difference to be honest. i usually order to go and have a beer at the bar while i wait or eat at the bar and service is good.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday dinner last night with my husband. He ordered the alfredo pasta with chicken dish. He was literally sick to his stomach all night long! He is still sick, and can't keep anything down. Its Awful.  We may go to the hospital, it is just that bad!!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about Oregano's so I had to check it out.  It's fairly good pizza, I think, but I don't think it was particularly cheap (just average prices).  The margarita I got in a moment of insanity was horrible but at least it was fairly strong.  We showed up at 4:30 PM and didn't have to wait for a table, but waited an hour from the time we ordered to get our pizza (a pan and a thin crust).  People were waiting for tables before 6 PM.  Had to get the pizookie at a friend's recommendation.  Definitely yummy but not irresistibly so.  I'm glad to have gone, and I'd recommend it for someone new to check out, but I don't think I'd ever go back.  The food is good and reasonably priced but not worth the hour wait for cooking plus the 1-4 hr wait just to be seated.  If I did go back, it would only be on an off-hour."}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly staff and vegetarian friendly. This is one of their best locations and always busy. Take a lot of friends here who visit from out of town. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed in my first experience at an Oreganos. We had a large group with a reservation when they opened. Service was slow, entrees took more than 90 minutes to come. My entree contained two over done sausages that resembled cardboard and tasted just as bad. To their credit, they did remove it from my bill when I sent the dish back. Definitely will need some convincing to come back and try again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Charles, thanks for awesome service and making my moms birthday memorable. Looking forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this place and I don't understand why there are empty tables and a wait time of 45 minutes. We were told both visits there isn't enough servers. Both times? Weeks apart? The food is alright but not wait for drama server good"}
{"text":"Went here for post holiday lunch with family. First time at this location. I'm sorry, but it was the worst thin crust pizza I have ever had including store bought frozen.  The crust was dry and hard and tasted like cardboard and the bottom had a layer of flour coated on it. Should have said something, but we were hungry and didn't want to wait any longer. The waitress was really amped up and said it was because she drank coffee umm, yea right. She put the pizza stand on her waist sideways and walked off like that. Freakin wierd. We won't be back to this location ever and our bill came to $84 bucks. I hope a manager reads this."}
{"text":"Update the owner responded back to me. I appreciate that me n my coworker will give you guys another shot. Like I said before tho we work in the restaurant field we know how workers should act. Thanks will be back"}
{"text":"Normally I really enjoy oregano's just went to this location. My boyfriend and I ordered a salad and the alfredo in the dark. The alfredo was over priced for having a oily butter sauce. no cream  no flavor.  The vino bambino is usually my favorite but when we got it it was warm and the pasta that was tossed in was old waxy and melted in my mouth. Gross. .  I want to give oregano's another chance but not at this location!"}
{"text":"I love coming here like twice a month during the week because it's not as busy. The staff is friendly I recommend the diablo pasta it's spicy and for dessert a puzzukie!!"}
{"text":"This review might seem unfair considering that we ate at this Oregano's just before going to Gabbage to see the fantastic musical performance of Mannheim Steamroller two days after Christmas, but my complaint spans several times visiting several different Oregano's in the Phoenix area.

I won't speak to the complaints of the quality of food or the lack of cleanliness at these restaurants ... although the negative reviews about these issues do give me pause. My main complaint is about the extremely loud, cacophonous noise emanating from the speakers all around the dining area.

For those who have never visited an Oregano's you'll want to know that your ears and brain will be assaulted by jazz so loud that conversation will be difficult.

Now, I know that music style is an acquired taste, and everyone is welcome to his or her personal opinion as to what they like. But, restaurants like Oregano's need to understand that jazz in particular is probably the most polarizing style of music out there.

You play classical music or soft rock and most people won't even really hear it ... they tune it out in favor of conversation or thinking or whatever they are there to do. You play jazz, however, and everyone will have an opinion about it ... they either love it or hate it. And truth be told, more people hate jazz than love it -- especially when blasted at full volume, making conversation difficult.

Does it really make sense for a restaurant to polarize it's customers that way? Personally, I don't get it. All I could think while there the other day was that I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible so my pulse and blood pressure could regulate itself back to normal. It was like I couldn't even breathe properly under the influence of that awful, discordant, melody-less noise.

Jazz proponents like to point out how beautiful jazz is because of its improvisational qualities. If you review \"Why I like jazz\" on Google you'll discover that most of the reasons revolve around the players, the culture and the history of jazz ... just the great feeling of how cool it is to be a fan of jazz. In other words, basically, jazz is just cool. However, those qualities don't make for a pleasant listening experience for a wide range of people who merely want a decent meal without having their senses assaulted.

Having said that, if a restaurant wants to be \"cool\" and cater only to those who like loud, obnoxious \"cool\" music it is their right to do that.

I'm just saying that if you want a pleasant, relaxing meal and don't wish to have your ears assaulted with cacophonous noise, Oregano's will not be the place for you to visit."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, phenomenal food. I've never had a bad experience here and absolutely loved every visit."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza in the Scottsdale area! This is the first place we go for dinner when we vacation in Scottsdale and usually the last night in town. The thin crust pizza is our favorite and compares to any of our favorites in the Chicago area. We also like the toasted ravioli appetizer! The cookie pizza is a great dessert.
We really enjoy the outdoor eating area and the staff is always great. On our most recent visit we spent some time talking to Jackie, one of their managers. She made sure our visit was as enjoyable as our many other visits. 
If your looking for excellent Chicago style pizza with a great outdoor patio and wait staff, make sure you give Oreganos a try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely superb!!!!!!!!
Outstanding service and food. 
We sat at the bar, and were treated like royals.  This was our 1st time at this restaurant.  'o my gosh'!!!    
Mmmmm delicious.
So often people take the time to complain about service , attitudes and product/s, and they dont realize the importance of taking the time to compliment these things. Right to the bus boys, and the cooks, so very important.
Thank you Marie , Joe and 
manager Garnett.

Warmly, Gyl and Gary from Chicago"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. I love when places emphasise excellent customer service. This is one of those places. Had the thin crust pizza. Will go back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I have lived in the valley for 18 years, and Oregano's has always been a big part of my life. Lately it seems like the quality has diminished. I used to be confident getting anything here and knew it would be delicious. Now it tastes pretty ok, but not special. For example, the lettuce tastes like it was dumped out of a presealed bag instead of chopped fresh. The bolo pasta used to blow me away because of something different in the way they cooked their noodles, now it tastes like what we make at home. The Pablo Picasso salad didn't have the same zesty flavor with caramelized onion and  cilantro that it used to. It just seems like overall they are cutting corners as they expand. What set them apart was quality, which now doesn't seem like the focus. Also service used to blow me away, now it is ok; which seems to be the theme for Oregano's now."}
{"text":"I called to see how long the wait would be for 9 people. They said an hour. I told them I could be there in 15 minutes and asked if they could put my name down. They said they don't take reservations. I've heard from multiple people that this is a huge problem at the Cave Creek location, which is why they no longer frequent Oreganos. We've never tried the place and apparently never will. It's too bad for them."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza best wings ever with gold sause!!! Cookie with ice cream is the best thing that's ever happened to me !!! Food is the best iv had sense visiting  az for the weekend !!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, and consistent with other Oreganos....however we had flies all around us and when mentioned to the manager, she did not seem to care."}
{"text":"Oregano's does so much right with their pizza and sauces that it was difficult not to give them five stars, but I am trying keep it real here there are a lot of really good pizza joints in the Phoenix area. Honestly though I think I can rate them higher on their wings than on the pizza, not many places can get just the right amount of crispy and just the right amount of meaty when it comes to chicken wings and for my taste these guys nail it. I give the wings 5 stars hands down I will put Oregano's up against anyone in town for chicken wings. I have tried multiple locations and they are consistent at all three that I have tried. The only thing that is frustrating is that they are always busy and the situation to get a table can be a bit irritating when you have been waiting all week for cheat day...and speaking of cheat day the pizzookie or whatever it is called is super good as well if you are in the mood to pack on about 2500 calories in one meal these guys are one of the best places to blow a clean eating streak."}
{"text":"STUFFED mushrooms were incredible!!!  Huge portabellas with all the toppings of a pizza and more.  Drinks were strong and tasty.  The place is too cute, it's too bad they are moving locations.  :("}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Convenient location if you are on the ASU campus. Get there earlier for dinner if you want to sit inside. Get the cookie dessert.  It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Oregano's!  My first experience was in Flagstaff with a location being right off NAU's campus, and I was thrilled more started to open up in the valley.  There is one in Mesa, now, very close to me, and the ambiance remains the same.  I love the vintage decoration, the music, usually Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz icons, and the FOOD!  All the appetizers are amazing, especially the Boom Dip.  My favorite pizza is the O-Riva.  And passing up the Pizzookie (pizza cookie) is out of the question, get your friends to dive into this amazing desert.  Also the bellinis are outstanding!  Enjoy your experience here, you will fall in love! Have patience at the smaller locations, usually there will be a wait."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, my family and I always enjoy a great time here. They have the best pizza, pasta, and wings my personal favorite wings are the Italian Gold."}
{"text":"This place was electric and full of great energy for a pizza joint. The host Jeremy was very attentive and even took our drink order and delivered them to our table. Our server Melissa was great she was very knowledgeable about the menu and hospitable. I was a server and bartender for eight years and really enjoyed coming to this place. Best Pizza Joint in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Oreganos! The Guacatony is amazing! My husband loves the pizza or sandwiches. We have never been disappointed, but are sad that they just switched from Coke to Pepsi products."}
{"text":"Appetizer came out quickly! We got the guaca-tony, which is great for avocado and garlic lovers. I ordered the big chicken taco salad, and it gave me two meals. I ate until I was stuffed too! Definitely go there hungry."}
{"text":"I get the ambiance and could even buy into it, but I have to say that I am consistently unimpressed by Oregano's. The portions are huge and are almost good, but I find everything on the menu to be oversalted. Service is ALWAYS slow, there's ALWAYS a wait, and it's one of those creepy chains where all the employees look like they've had their smiles screwed onto their faces with a corporate power-drill. Someone's putting something in the Kool-Aid.

Every once in a while, I would get a craving for a salad or some pasta and I'd go in, but I have never been back to one since I was in this location one evening just before they closed. The servers were cleaning some booths as part of the end of their shift. A girl pulled the bench of one booth back and a grapefruit-sized clump of white maggots dropped to the floor, squirming everywhere. I have no idea what they were eating, but I have never seen that many maggots in one place, let alone in a clump like that. This, in itself, is horrifying enough.... however, what I found disturbing was that none of the servers seemed especially shocked or surprised. The manager came over and comped something off our bill, but the experience was truly horrifying.

I will not eat in any Oregano's again.... that level of filth is unacceptable in any food service establishment."}
{"text":"So stoked to see the Big Kahuna tuna sandwich back on the menu! Love the pizza, the Picasso salad, and the Wedding soup! And my girl can get bubbles!"}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly customer service. Creative decor.  A bit of a long wait sometimes but worth it."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place one star because of how strong there drinks are. First, there was about a 20 min wait for drinks, ordering at the bar and sitting at a table. Appetizers can at the same time our drinks did, including non-alcoholic. Everything was very very salty. For the main meal it was a disaster. The frys looked like they bought them at the store across the street. My pasta came out cold, I asked for it to be warmed up and when it came back it was so spicy my lips where burning and i couldn't even eat it. I didn't even say can you make it hotter, I said can you put this in the microwave for a little bit. Being a server my self, I felt really bad for the server because I felt like the kitchen just needed to get there shit together in the end."}
{"text":"OMG this place is to die for. Have my whole family hooked on it. I've tried several dishes, but my favorite by far is the Bollo Pasta. The meatballs and sausage is top notch. The thing crust pizza, fabulous."}
{"text":"Why is it that this bar is always full of employees eating on there brake while 20 customers are waiting for a seat at the bar? The management at this location could care less about its customers"}
{"text":"The service was great and the atmosphere was fabulous for our party of 12 for a friends birthday. However, I got food poisoning which had to have come from the salad that I ordered since I was the only one that ordered a salad. I guess that taught me the lesson of not ordering a salad on a hot summer day. Or they prepared the salad and it sat around until the rest of the order was complete before bringing it out. Either way my fun evening out for a friends birthday was ruined. I'll probably come back but won't order a salad again!"}
{"text":"Awful experience this week.  Ordered the Oregano's Favorite salad.  A quarter of the salad was not edible.  Disgusting, rancid lettuce.  After calling over the manager, his response was to say he would check the lettuce supply to make sure no one else would have to endure what I did.
HOW ABOUT WHAT I HAD TO ENDURE?  Not even an offer to remake the salad.  Those people just don't care.  Management needs a lesson in customer service.
Will never return."}
{"text":"Scary good.  Seriously.  The pizza was FANTASTIC! Really. Try the Pizza, please!  

As far as I can tell they have just one desert. Know what? That's A-OK because the Pizza Cookie crushes all others.  One desert to rule them all, really.  Try it.  It was amazing.

Portions were large and the service was great.  People like working here.

This is on my must-go-to-when-in-Phoenix list."}
{"text":"I've tried to like this place. I really have. The management is the only reason they are getting 2 stars instead of one. They can't even seem to make good pasta. Over priced. Under impressive. Won't be wasting any more money there. I don't know if I just always pick the wrong thing or if people are just buying into hype, but I don't get it. The food is terrible. The management is fantastic though."}
{"text":"We came in for a family Birthday.. So looking forward to the southern cooking. 
Let's start off in when getting there we wanted to sit out side but we could not because as stated by hostess there was a large party outside and there was not a server who could really take care of us.
We ordered green fired green tomatoes for a appetizers in which we never received.
Our dinner came out cold which we hope could have loved to have been fixed but our server did not come back to check on us till 20 min later. 
We ordered more drinks which we never received.
Over all we can sadly say we do not plan to come back!"}
{"text":"Don't know why I chose a Friday night in Scottsdale to try a new restaurant, but ended up at Oregano's with my brother for dinner.  Arriving around 6:40, we had a 30 minute wait.

After being seated, our awesome waitress Kylie took care of us the rest of the evening. We shared the zucchini fries, antipasto salad and a 10\" Chicago pan pizza. All the food was great and the portions are large. If you get pizza, let her dig it out of the pan for you. She talks down her skills, but she's really a pro.

Get your butts to Oregano's and ask for Kylie to take care of you.

Two thumbs up for this joint.  It's on the list for \"let's go at least once a month\"."}
{"text":"Oreganoes? My second visit to the Mesa restaurant. Guess what? Chicken but I like it. It's not great; it's kinda fun but not like a merry-go-round kinda fun (that's like one of the bests next to roller coasters! Oh emm gee!). It also has a fairly horrific... I mean fairly terrific patio and a good patio goes a long *insert expletive* way. For whatever reason, maybe something to do with the damp dark basement I had to eat my dinners alone in as a wee lad after spilling a gallon of paint on the garage floor (I did it quite often. It made the garage prettier.), I would prefer to eat at a patio table over a table inside any day of the year, even an August in Phoenix metro area or a rainy day (if it's covered). This one in Mesa is covered even though the two times I've been there the weather was beautifully moderate. Another wonderful  thing about patios is... that in civilized places you can smoke however, this is Mesa. It does have a fire pit though for those cold nights when the company you're with isn't quite warm enough.

This second visit of mine I met a few friends from school who were devouring a 's-wonderful thin crusted pizza topped 's-marvelous bits of mushrooms and smothered in a 's-awful-ly nice blanket of cheese. Tasty (without and exclamation mark). The food that I've tried is fairly mediocre; not bad but not great. I mostly had a couple of Kilt Lifters while they ate their delectably edible giant frisbee. 

The first time I went was with a few friends and this one dwarfish guy that reminds me of sharp pointy things and dull wit but mostly I was able to ignore Gimli because of the scrumptious Turkey Stuffed. Ordering from the menu was a bit of a sensory overload, though. That menu has stuff going on! Over here and over there and don't forget this just passed that. Egads! 

The service was fair and friendly both times and the food was brought out in a timely fashion. And this most recent time we were cursin' up a storm too. It was like a brothel full of sailors on the patio that afternoon which I think the Mormon family next to us appreciated more than we did. 

The food = meh
The patio and service = pretty good. 

Look! it's my first A-OK."}
{"text":"Stopped here one day on the way home after viewing the online menu, and spotted this delicious desert. I'm not a big fan of sweets, but this is a must have. Your choice of a 1/2 pound of Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter Chocolate or White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cookie dough, slightly baked in a 6-inch pizza pan then topped with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. I would like to add that they give you the option to order a combination of the dough. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Oreganos is delicious and delivers pretty consistent food! Love the lunch mini stuffed pizza, the Pablo Picasso salad and their pizza!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Oregano's? I mean the food is super tasty but the only thing that sucks is that 90% of the menu takes about an hour, even appetizers. Went in one time for pizza, was told it would take 45 min to an hour and we decided to skip it. Second time we went in, for lunch, all three of us got salads, but were super hungry so we wanted to order the stuffed mushroom app (seemingly the only somewhat healthier choice) and were told it would take 45 min for those since they were baked. Skipped it too then. The food here is good, no complaints, it's just kind of ridiculous to have to place your order over the telephone and wait a bit before you go out to eat. At that rate why not just get it to go?"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Amazing food and waitress. Had pizza and pasta but you won't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Food was excellent! Can't go wrong with \"moms sausage and peppers\"."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place, lemonade is not too sweet and not too tangy. Mexicano pizza is good but very hot so suggest not to order whole pizza.  Their guaca mole pizza, not sure about the name (maybe guacatoni) is huge and extremely delicious."}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant when we want Italian food.  The only downside is that it's everyone's go-to Italian restaurant so you may have to wait a bit for a table if you don't go early.   It is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Aiyaaah the dreaded 3 star review. I hate writing the 3 star review because you already know exactly what I'm going to say. 3 stars says it all. A-OK. Good, but not great, nothing special. And that basically summarizes my feelings about Oregano's.

So I came here with a friend. He claims it's one of his favorite Italian restaurants and Italian is pretty hard to mess up so why not? Tagging along... We step into the restaurant. Colors green and red everywhere! Digging the atmosphere! Digging the old school vintage vibes! Jukeboxes and checkered floors and walls adorned with paintings and dim lights! It's wonderful! So an A+ for decor! But then again, I am not an interior decorator. So what do I know?

Moving on to the food! I ordered a pasta called Alfredo the Dark. It came with spiral pasta drenched in cream sauce, diced tomatoes and poblano chillies. Underneath the pasta were 4 slices of bread, made infinitely more appetizing by the fact that it was sitting beneath the pasta and soaking up ALL the cream sauce. Divine!

The chicken in the pasta was well seasoned and roasted. The pasta itself, while a solid pasta, wasn't mind-blowing. Delicious and safe. Too safe. The poblano chillies did not have much of an impact on the dish which was very disappointing. In fact, the dish wasn't spicy in the least. But other than that, you know. Chicken pasta with cream sauce. It was good! You can't screw it up. I just wish the poblano chillies had challenged me.

Good thing about this place is that the service was fantastic. Also, the portion sizes are pretty decent too. My ~$12 pasta became 2 whole meals for me so that's always nice! 

Will I return here? Yes absolutely. I had a lovely meal with my friend and I'm sure we shall return in due time. And I will come back with absolutely no qualms because this is a good restaurant. It's not a great restaurant and it falls far short of my finest Italian dining experiences but it's a good restaurant and sometimes good is good enough  (and cheap enough)."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a lot of times over the years and the food is always good. If you like italian, there are lots of choices. If you like Mexican, they have guacamole. I don't really get the connection there but I will choose the cheesy garlic bread every time :)"}
{"text":"So delicious! our service was amazing and the pizza was good, different than I'm used to. the portions are massive, so if you aren't a huge eater, I recommend sharing meals! my mom and I shared a big salad (the only sizes are big and real big) and it was more than we needed! we also got a pizza and took it home for leftovers! our waiter was very smart and on top of it. only complaint was that the atmosphere was very noisy, so don't expect and quiet calm meal! Definitely recommend though. I will be back myself"}
{"text":"Always yummy & made to perfection!! Fabulous Italian food!! Stuffed pizza is a wait, but oh so good!"}
{"text":"I am here in town for the Az 2017 Iron man my sister recommended this place and sometimes as you know it can be a hit and miss were  you can find a good place to eat. Oh my!  the food is Excellent !!! The portion sizes are perfect. The customer service is greatFrom the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out. Shout out to Samantha she was our waitress."}
{"text":"All I have to say is you have to try the belini! They don't have a full bar here but who needs it with this great creation. You are only allowed 2 so sip slowly, although to fast and to might get a brain freeze. The pizza and italian dishes are \"ok\" as far as italian food goes. I would suggest trying some of the less popular menu items you might not find other places. They also have a secret wing sauce combination not on the menu that is to die for. Be adventurous here and you won't be dissapointed. For those who like supersonic ultra hot wings you might meet your doom here. It's no joke. Be prepared to wait as well. They normally have a nice size crowd at dinner and on weekends."}
{"text":"Oregano's has a good selection of lunch and dinner offerings that aren't very expensive and always tastes great.  I highly recommend the pizza cookie for dessert, yum!"}
{"text":"The first night I moved to AZ this is what we ordered because it was close and had decent food choices.  Between four of us we ordered two pizzas and a sandwich.  It didn't take long to fill our order that day but if it's a weekend expect a wait.  I had the pesto pizza and it was amazing!  It took me a few days of yummy leftovers to finish it.  The other pizza I was told was just as good.  The italian sandwich took my husband three days to finish it because it was so large.  Plan on going back there again and again."}
{"text":"Must have the infamous Bellini! Frozen daiquiri type of drink. From pizzas to pastas to salads: this is our go-to spot!  Also has a great kid menu."}
{"text":"Yummmy place my regular is Alfredo the dark soo goood pizza cookie=heaven on earth, you want Italian head over to oreganos crew is awesome place is so nice as well keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"Meh. That's all I can say. This is my 2nd time in after my frist visit I said I would probably never return because there really wasn't anything on the menu I liked. I ordered hot wings and didn't like them. The place is nice enough that. They didn't charge me for the wings so hospitality and service wise this place is amazing. Atmosphere is great and have had great wait-staff. 

Now this time around I came back because a friend had just started working there and told me to come in for a 2nd try. Told me to get something other than the wings. So this time I tried the brechetta (didn't spell that right huh?) and that was pretty good. Nothing special but good. Got the margarita pizza pan style and it was good but again nothing special. Then we got dessert. The highlight of the evening was that freakin cookie. It was so delicious. The cookie was baked fresh so it was still warm and soft yet crispy with ice cream on top. The combination of the fresh warm cookie with cold ice cream was amazing. I thought I was full with the food I had ate but once I had a bite of the cookie I was digging in like I hadn't eaten a thing. 

So overall I don't understand what the big hype about the food is because its \"ok\" food for me. Its good but does not live up to what other people have told me about this place. On the other hand I will be returning for a drink and that cookie again."}
{"text":"No longer a fan of this place. In reading the negative reviews, one thing remains consistent. When you have a complaint, no one cares. If you don't enjoy your food, no one cares. If you submit feedback, in my case I literally asked if there was something else I should've done regarding the food I barely ate due to it being drowned in dressing and why I was still charged, no one cares. If you're gonna put on big boy pants and run a legitimate business, chances are, your guests actually matter as does their satisfaction. If that's something that you are incapable or unwilling to do, maybe look into another profession. Until then, this concept is just another entitled Mom and Pop shop. I'll happily give my money to another establishment. And to think, all you had to do was reply to one of my emails. It's sad that this is how you operate and that you're ok with it."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, great taste, excellent service, good portions. We love oreganos. We are from Texas and we make it a point to visit oreganos almost every time we visit arizona. We have tried many of the menu items and everything is delicious. Favorite pizza is grandma Gs. Favorite pasta is Alfredo the dark. Leave room for the chocolate chip pizza cookie... it's a must have with ice cream."}
{"text":"The food was \"P\" for pass. The peppers and sausage on pasta had tiny pieces of red and green peppers and even smaller slices of sausage.  Very dry with little sauce, very dry. My wife had the Chicken Alfredo, and it too had very little sauce as well as chicken.  Both dishes were very dry, with little sauce.  Prices weren't bad but for what we got, but not worth it.  Doubt we will go back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened but the deterioration of this place is shocking. The pizza has always been good (still is) but the service was amazing and now is horrible. Appetizers come out 2 minutes before pizza, disappearing wait staff, filthy beer glasses. Pretty much any way to provide poor service is perfected here. 

Just a couple years ago we all talked about the amazing service at Oregano's. You would walk in and be greeted 10 times on the way to your table, followed by amazing wait staff. It's a very different place now.

Countless options out there - We won't be back."}
{"text":"By far the worse food and longest wait time... we've had oreganos at other locations and it's been great. This location is full of half ass workers. You can tell there's no effort put on the food or drinks. Server was great but the food was not close to their standards. 
Don't go to this location better off eating Burger King.."}
{"text":"Get there early as there is usually a short wait. Food is great! Try the pizza or the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"hhad another great experience tonight.  waited in the bar for my to go order.  Jenna was the bartender and she wowed me with her service and friendly smile.  atmosphere is fantastic, food is amazing...fyi be prepared to wait up to 45 min. for pan pizza.  i was in no hurry, but if you are, call ahead."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I always get one of their pastas and of course a chocolate chip pizza cookie after!! Or sometimes I just go for the pizza cookie!! They are always packed during dinner time and on weekends do plan accordingly. But I've never been disappointed. You call to make a to go order! Even for the pizza cookie!!!!"}
{"text":"I heard really good things about Oregano's ever since I moved to Scottsdale a year ago. So when I finally decided to go there for lunch on a Sunday with my boyfriend to celebrate our 6 months, I was extremely disappointed. 
We were immediately sat, being one of maybe a dozen patrons in the restaurant. Our server came to the table right after we sat and asked us what he could get for us. We both asked for water and my boyfriend ordered a Sam Adams seasonal. When the server returned with our drinks he asked us if we were ready to order. Since we had not been there before we took a while to decide on food. So the server gave us more time to decide. While he was gone we both sipped the beer and it was flat and undrinkable. The server came back moments later and started talking to us about the menu and making recommendations. We finally settled on the Margherita pizza and after we put in our order our server was no where to be found. We sat there 40 minutes watching others come in and order their food. We still did not get our pizza and could not find our server so we finally just got up and left. A host said goodbye to us on the way out but did not ask us how our meal was. My boyfriend and I both work in a restaurant so we understand slow ticket times when a restaurant is busy, but being one of only a few tables there was just unacceptable. We went to California Pizza Kitchen and had a much better experience and actually got our food. I was very disappointed in our experience and will never return to any Oregano's location."}
{"text":"We came to this location after finding out our local Gilbert location had over an hour wait at 8pm on Sunday.   There was no wait, the staff was super friendly and the food came out in less than 15 minutes. I am so impressed,  we usually have to wait forever at the Gilbert location.  I think this location is definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Shrimp Scampi - cooked to perfection! Authentic Italian cooking, a hidden gem in Cave Creek. The Marinara and pastas were cooked the way your mother would have if she came from Brooklyn. I would stay away from the appetizers if your a true foodie but the entrees are the real deal, they are the reason the parking lot is crowed every night and are a reason to come back again and again....service is top notch as well....a nod to Kareem....thank you for a great family dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I stay in Tempe every January and February on our way to and from Maui. A few years ago, a hotel employee recommended Oregano's and we've been returning ever since. Patio dining in winter is a real novelty for us (We live in RI). We enjoy the garden or Kale Caesar salad, followed by a delicious pesto pizza. Relaxing ambience and friendly waitstaff complete the dining experience. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. They just updated the menu and the Chicken Parm is on point."}
{"text":"We tried ordering a deep dish pizza for take out and they told us it wouldn't be ready for 2 hours! How is that even possible. In from Chicago and I know it takes some time to cook but that is ridiculous, and it was just for take out. I haven't had any good pizza out here yet so I really wanna try it but now I'm not in a hurry to give them my money. Maybe I will try another location soon, we'll see"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places ever! Even their pasta is delicious! Alfredo of the dark! If you order deep dish make sure you are not in a rush or super hungry because it takes awhile but is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Tired of this place. We have gotten in twice and had poor food and experiences from wait staff. Tonight we used the wait list via yelp app for six. It showed 15-33 min wait. We got there in 10 min and were told by the check in person that the wait list app doesn't work for parties of six. It will be an hour wait. My daughter had picked this place for her birthday dinner. We went to la Bona pasta to no wait, great food and great service. Try them rather than oreganos."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this restaurant and thought my family and I would try it out.  We ordered some appetizers and each had a main dish.  The appetizers were delivered at the same time as our meal.  The manager came out an apologized.   We ended up not eating the appetizers because we did not want our Chicago style pizza to get cold.  When the bill came the appetizers were still on the bill.  I overheard the manager apologize to a table next to us for the same problem and offer to remove the appetizers from their bill.

Not very customer service oriented.  Spend your time and money some place else."}
{"text":"Oregano's has delicious food and a pleasant staff.  I don't really mind the longer wait for my food because I get the sense that it is fresh rather than a frozen entree that someone popped into a microwave.

We have a large family and whenever there is a college graduation or birthday party, we usually end up at the Gilbert Oregano's restaurant and we spend a pretty penny in Oregano's standards.  

One thing that makes my stomach a bit queasy is the Hooter's inspired attire.  Very short shorts are one thing, but the low-cut tank tops gross me out.  Maybe I'm just germ phobic but those waitresses get hot running around all the time.  I don't like the thought of someone's uncovered sweaty armpit hanging over my dinner.  It just doesn't seem sanitary to me and I wish they'd class it up a bit.  Aren't there Department of Health dress codes for wait staff beyond shirts and shoes?  If showing cleavage makes the girls feel good about themselves, fine.  Whatever you need to do... just please cover up your armpits.  I am sure it can be accomplished - I don't see the males walking around in leotards and they seem to be handling the heat just fine!!

One final word - I'm not a fan of the illegal substance references written on the backs of your shirts.  \"Legalize Marinara.\"  Try explaining that to a child and helping them to understand why this is \"funny\" when they're being taught that drugs are bad.  I know it's a silly parody, it just isn't in good taste for a reputable business."}
{"text":"Okay Okay Okay People!  Calm down and relax, your going to get your Pizza Cookie in a timely manner, so stop crowding.

That's probably the least favorite part about Oregano's is how busy it tends to get during the lunch and dinner hours.  My word of advice is get their just a little earlier to beat the rush.

To the actual review: Oregano's has always been a favorite of mine, ever since I lived on ASU's campus.  I probably ate there two to three times a week.  Man I loved it!  Now that I've graduated I've had time to try other things, and my affection for the place has definitely started to diminish as their are finer things in life than Oregano's.

Now that they are adding more locations it seems to be a lot more convenient (especially the Ocotillo location), but the trade off is the food has been watered down a bit.  Trust me, I know.  It still is a great place to hang out with friends, and if your looking to share your food with someone, cause the portions are HUGE!  It just seems like Oregano's is the trendy place to hangout cause everyone is doing it, but trust me....there are finer things in life than Oregano's!

Last, I know that everyone always raves about how great their pizza is, but honestly I've definitely had better pizza in the valley ie: Cibo, Pizzeria Biancho, or La Grande Orange (Check out my reviews).  

Here are my favorites items on the menu:

-Meatball Sandwich
-Big Kahuna Tuna Sandwich (no longer available....RIP)
-Zany Ziti Pasta
-Italian Gold Wings
-Pablo Picasso Salad
-Guaca-Tony
-Pesto Bruschetta
-Pizza Cookie"}
{"text":"So, I wrote a review about Oregano's before and having eaten there recently I thought I would write a newer review.

I haven't eaten here for over two years, because I had moved outside the state, but on a recent visit I had the chance to eat at one of my favorites.

I have to say that I was no longer impressed with the food. I noticed that the menus changed a bit and some of the same foods were altered. I had Zany Ziti with a side of Meatballs. Immediately, I noticed that the meatballs had no sauce added to them and the ziti wasn't as cheesy/saucy as before. This definitely alerted the taste of the dish. My wife ordered a standard cheese pizza and noticed that the taste want as good as we remembered.

Could be a change of palate but I know really good food and now that I've eaten here recently it was no longer a great place.

Is it true that with growth of the franchise that the quality diminishes?"}
{"text":"Dined here tonight, definitely didn't disappoint! The hostesses were very nice and witty, made the 1.5 hour wait sound bearable by offering drinks and appetizers. Our server was outstanding keeping us updated with the food and checking on us frequently. I have always loved the Oreganos sense of humor and atmosphere. Pizza was a tad salty but overall the experience was great!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, always consistent. Experienced a delay in service at lunch today. However, this was quickly resolved by Brian, the manager. His smile and welcoming attitude is why we return for more pizza cookies and salad! ;)"}
{"text":"Seated right away ! Great location , and great pizza !! We had the 12 in thin crust which is a perfect amout for two ! Great find for these two travelers from Indiana !!"}
{"text":"Some of the things on the menu are strange... But I've liked everything I ordered both times I've been.  Adventurous and boring (like myself) italian food lovers alike will find something they will enjoy.  The waitresses are hot so thats a plus too haha.  And one more thing PIZZA COOKIE."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Whenever I am in the Phoenix/Tempe area I have to stop and have at least one meal here! The Guaca Tony is AMAZING! The homemade pizza chips  compliment this Italian version of Guacamole fantastically! One word descibes this- YUM! Everything I've tried is delish! Pizza, meatball sandwich with grilled onions and the original salad with the Italian dressing are my ultimate FAVs! This is a must stop if you are in the area! Service is usually GREAT! Had one bad waitress in all the years I've been going! Fun, Friendly Staff!"}
{"text":"We ordered bowl o pasta and pesto penne bake. We we stood that the rock hard bread bowl was not to eat and that the spaghetti they used in the bread bowl was what you get for angel hair pasta. The pasta was water smoked and had been sitting for quite a while. We were told that is just how it is. Needless to say, we will not go back. It didn't even resemble Oregano's food. So sad."}
{"text":"I really love the food at this restaurant and have been here many times. However I would recommend that you always sit inside. Unless you really enjoy fishing bugs out of your drinks and sharing your meal with them. Disgusting!! Ruined my entire experience. Please warn future patrons of dis disadvantage of eating on the patio during the nice weather."}
{"text":"This place is great! Everyone is so friendly and helpful I always feel so welcome! Parking lot is a little small but I usually come during less busy hours to have a good spot. Food is amazing! Awesome job guys!"}
{"text":"Ohhhregahhhhhhnohhhhhssss!  That's how the name should be on the front of this Oregano's because it's pure Chicago style pizza ecstasy up in here.

We tried this location today because we were TCB that took us to the Maricopa area.  In contrast to the Scottsdale locations, this spot is relatively new, great parking, and wasn't nearly as busy.

Arrived around noon and were seated immediately.  Everything was fresh and delicious, even tastier than Scottsdale - the iced tea is somehow better at this location too."}
{"text":"Three of us went for lunch the other day and one of the group received the wrong pizza.  The server promptly took it back but we waited for about 25 minutes and were finally told that the server accidentally canceled the order instead of resubmitting it, we weren't happy but agreed to wait for the replacement.  We finished our lunches while our poor friend waited but she eventually received the correct order.  

What struck me about this experience was that the manager immediately came over, apologized, and told us lunch would be on them - for all of us.  I don't know about you but my experience is that it's the customer the usually has to alert the manager and even then, it's not guaranteed that you will be offered anything other than an excuse (this infuriates me btw).  A response like this is usually reserved for high end spots where you're paying for great service via the meal prices.

The food is consistently fresh and good, and I'm extremely pleased with how they handled this situation."}
{"text":"Great food and really good service. This is a place that is easy to get into and consistent with their food and service. I'll definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Our waiter \" Danny \" was amazing. The food was great and came out fast. We didn't have to wait to get refills. Very consistent."}
{"text":"Oreganos is by far the favorite restaurant in my household. The food is consistently excellent, the service is awesome, and the staff is friendly and professional. It's a busy location (because it's so good) but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive pasta dishes! We've had the pizza before and loved it so we wanted to try something different. Had the chicken pasta and the plate was so huge we had to take half of it home. Also had the pizza cookie! Delicious. Going back again for sure."}
{"text":"We love coming to Oreganos! The staff is always friendly and the food is always great. Prices aren't too high, especially for the quality and quantity you get. My favorites are the Pablo Picaso salad and Bollo Pasta... The drinks are great too! Can't pass up on a white sangria or Bellini!"}
{"text":"We held my son's graduation party here at the Scottsdale/Shea location on May 21. I talked about the idea with Tammy, the manager. She then put me in touch with Jane. Working with Jane to plan the event and menu was easy, efficient and she was great to work with. On the day of, the room was ready early, I could decorate early, bring in a cake and serve it, no problem. The room was perfect, the video hookup was easy so I could show a movie, and the service was excellent. The food was piping hot and excellent. The staff boxed up the leftovers and we ate for four more days! It was on a busy Saturday night in May, but our group felt like we were the only ones in the restaurant. I highly recommend working with Tammy and the staff at Oreganos as a venue to hold your next group party. Ciao!"}
{"text":"We visited this Oreganos location for a family celebration. We were told the wait was 45 minutes. An hour and a half later we were seated. The kitchen was behind and it took another 45 minutes to get our order. Everyone but my elderly mother received their food. The waitress had failed to put in her order. The food was cold and inedible. This location is a poor excuse for an Oreganos Chain. I wouldn't eat here again if the food was free."}
{"text":"Seriously lived up to the hype! My boyfriend and I got the Bollo Pasta, and it was the greatest deal! 2 bowls of heavenly pasta for less than $10! We were so filled by that, we could barely take 2 bites of the pizza we ordered! But our family sure was glad we saved so much of that delicious pie for them!! Cannot wait to come back! It's a new favorite for sure!! And those pun-ny t-shirts are GOLDEN!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and good pasta.  And the pizookie is gnarly!  I wish there was one in San Fran."}
{"text":"I am usually never disappointed in visiting Oregano's  but today my visit to this location was just plain horrible.  We went at 1pm on Sunday and there seemed to be a rush at that time.  Told wait was 35 minutes.  Actually waited close to an hour.  At least 8 parties left and no one was seated.  Misters were not on in the outside waiting area (only place ro wait) and it was awful.  Upon being seated, there were at least 4, yes 3, empty booths/tables that had already been cleared.  The hostess obviously needed help.  I asked for no tomatoes on my pasta and yet it came out covered in them.    Very disappointed and won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I love this place, less sodium in the food is the only critique?"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! First of all the customer service is top notch. Everyone greeted me when I came in to pick up the order and seems genually happy to be working there.  Are you hiring? Lol! Secondly the food is top notch. The best pizza I've had.  Period. Working just down the road I can see how this  will be a frequent place for lunch! Now if only you did frequent flyer miles for return customers! Thanks for all you do."}
{"text":"Pasta just ok.
Pizza just ok.
When your desserts are the best thing on the menu time to re-evaluate the menu.

Family style restaurant with pretty average food. Made for large groups and bigger parties."}
{"text":"Let's start with the appetizer. Everyone must try the Gold Wings!!! Delicious!!!!

Next we move to the salads for 4. Whoa they are HUGE!!!! Quite a tasty salad as well!!! Plenty to share. 

Then there is the pizza. So many different combos of flavors.  I have tried them all and cannot complain about any of them. They are like music to my ears and happiness to my stomach. They give kids their own doh to play with. The tropical tea is abundant

Bring a sweater...they like to keep it about 60 degrees in here. 

If you live at the Vive...stay away. The businesses here don't need your cars flooding the lots here too. I bet the Vivers are the ones requesting all the giant boulders to block the parking for anyone not driving a Prius."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. If you like a mega salad, this place will deliver. Big portions on most of the food. On the down side, they play their music fairly loud, which makes everyone else talk loader. So if you don't mind the noise, the food and staff are good!"}
{"text":"Customer service is great! My favorite dish is the Pablo Picasso Salad. I love the idea of having huge soda cups. And thin crust pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"This place allowed for pick up and they gave me plates and napkins to boot! The service was friendly and the food was spot on!"}
{"text":"I visited Oregano's on a Friday evening for a date with my sweetheart. They were busy but we got seated within 10 minutes. They gave us a cute little table for two, outside right by a fire.

The food, OH MY GOD, was so amazing. We ordered the Oregano's big salad, thin crust number one-o pizza, and a chocolate chip cookie pizza. We throughly enjoyed EVERY bite of our meal. I had the house made italian dressing with my salad. It was a very big salad and was plenty to share.The pizza was very unique and the crust was so delicate. Not your typical pizza from someplace like Pizza Hut. The cookie pizza was TO DIE FOR!!!! I haven't stopped thinking about it since out visit. 

The service was a little slow but it was dinner time on a Friday evening so I can't complain. We enjoyed the fire and romantic atmosphere which made the wait for our food not seem too bad. 

Visit your local Oregano's! It will be your new favorite!"}
{"text":"Great place. I went there on the opening weekend and they had a waiting list. It did seem a little disorganized, people going this way, people going that way, I can't count that against them though. I am sure it will probably become a well oiled machine in the coming month or so. The one and only complaint I have is the wait for a pizza! There is a warning on the menu saying that there is a 40-60 minute wait for the pizza because it's hand made...really, an hour!? I love pizza and Uncle Bears, which is a 15 foot walk has equally as good of pizza when you consider that it's ready in 10 minutes. That said everyone was very nice."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time we have ever eaten at an Oregano's. We were told it would be about 45 min. wait. We only waited roughly 30. My husband went to the bar to order us a drink while we waited. The service at the bar was a little disappointing, it took a while to be noticed. And they were out of mint for the Mojito I was craving. The perk to our first time experience was our adorable, personable, amazing waitress ANDREA. The food was great. I will definitely go again, and I will be asking to sit in Andrea's section."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant the other night. I had the garlic chicken lasagna and it was excellent and very well priced. My husband had a garlic chicken, potato pizza and loved it. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here last night for the first time. Outstanding atmosphere and customer service was AMAZING. Highly recommended for anyone desiring true Chicago style pizza. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"WOW! The manager there is a man of his word. Yes, they made a mistake but they showed how good they are at making things right. Thanks again for taking care of our issue so fast. Our latest meal was perfect!"}
{"text":"I have been to other locations and have had good experiences, but lunch today was not a good experience.  The hostess did not seem to be very skilled at managing the seating and we ended up having to wait for a table much longer than we should have.  The food was good but when our waitress refilled my drink, it tasted like a diet drink, so i asked her if I could get the regular soda that I had originally.  Immediately after I asked her, I heard the guy at the next table tell her that his re-filled diet drink tasted like regular soda.  She had taken the sodas to be refilled at the same time and had obviously mixed them up.  It is bad enough that I drank from the straw that another person had been using (gross), but then the waitress rushed back with new drinks and told us that the syrup was out and that is why my drink tasted funny, not because she had given me the wrong drink.  I have tasted drinks before when the syrup is low, and it doesn't make it taste like diet soda.  She lied to me.  I wish I had spoken to the manager, but I just wanted to go because I was grossed out.  I will never go to this restaurant again


Update: Customer service from the restaurant contacted me after my posting and apologized and offered to send me something to make up for my experience and encourage me to try them again.  Well, I sent my address but never got anything from them, so another BIG FAIL from Oreganos.  Hard to believe that they treat their customers this way."}
{"text":"Try the deep dish, the smallest size can easily feed 3-4 people, it's SOOO think and yummy.  Great staff and food, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I've gone here twice. The person I normally go with to eat never wanted to return, but I enjoyed the food enough to return. First time I had the bread sticks and Pizza, very VERY delicious! Second time I tried a sandwich, much to my pleasure. No regrets so far, very wonderful, I would recommend this place again and again. 

However! Word to the wise, long wait!! I don't mean 10 or 15 minutes, sometimes it can be 45 minutes to get a table, not even kidding. However, it's very worth the wait and even with that information, I still recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was in oregano's on bell road for lunch a couple of weeks ago and left my jacket on the back of my chair.  I realized this about an hour after I left and called to see if they had found it.  They had found it and said they would hold it until I could pick it up.  I went there 2 days later and after they searched everywhere, they couldn't find it.  They told me they would continue to look and check with other employees, and call me when they located it.  It is now over 2 weeks later and I haven't heard from anyone at oregano's.  I think that at the very least they should have followed up with a phone call to me.  In any case, I also think that someone that works at the restaurant is now wearing my jacket and I'm not.  I won't be going back there anymore."}
{"text":"Run from this place.  Extremely dirty.  Bathroom was horrible.  You can write your name in the layer of dust on the window sills.  The place smells like soured mopped water. Theyre definitely not using any sanitizer.  Drink station was filthy dirty.  Very disappointed.   Can only imagine how dirty the kitchen is.  First time to this location, been to 3 other Oreganos locations that were very clean.  Will report to health department with photos.  We didn't stay.  Got up and left.  Won't be back.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"Losing its service level unfortunately.  The last few times we have gone to this location we've vowed not to come back.  Last time we relented, what a mistake.  The last straw.  Food takes so much longer to get served than it used to.  Our last visit took so long, we asked to have our food boxed up instead.   
We are big fans of the food, always have been but the service has dropped so far we are chosing to dine elsewhere.  I'd advise you to do the same!"}
{"text":"really? 45 mins for a pizza - its good and I went back but can't they figure this out better? - the antipasta has taken a turn for the smaller - 2 of us finished it before the pizza came and we ate all our pizza. Service was good - but I always expect it to be faster."}
{"text":"Great location, nice atmosphere in the middle of all the action.  Awesome service.  Food was average. I ordered a calzone which was burnt on the top and more so on the bottom which left a taste in my mouth.  A friend also ordered a calzone and theirs was perfect... Luck of the draw I guess.  The Manager was kind enough to comp my calzone.  Other friends had chicken pasta dishes which they said chicken was dry and pasta was bland.  It was a very busy night and our food took almost 45 minutes and not hot when when did get it.  Perhaps on a slower night we may have had a better experience."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, based on the reviews on Yelp. They have an outside sitting area, but it was raining and we sat inside. The staff are very friendly and nice. They have a simple menu which is easy to browse. Also, the server was helpful in suggesting a dish. We ordered \" Italian Wedding Soup\" which comes in a pizza dough, it was very tasty. Granma's potato pizza is a very tasty, thin crust, and simple pizza. The inside decoration helps to bring the authentic Italian restaurant feelings to the customers."}
{"text":"By far my favorite pizza in town! The deep dish is to die for and so is their service! I have eaten here countless times and have never been let down!"}
{"text":"I would go here again, but pretty much just for the pizza cookie and the cheese filled ravioli's!! We ordered the thin crust Aunt Margaritas pizza, and when it came, we didn't like it very much. The crust seemed very dry to me. So we called the waitress over, and they made us another pizza, gave us a free appetizer (the ravioli's). Woohooo for two free pizzas! The waitstaff all have cute sayings on the back of their shirts (Legalize Marinara) and we were greeted by multiple people. Our dessert was out of this world. Soft, gooey, melty, delicious humongous chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top. My mouth is watering."}
{"text":"Beefstro salad is the best.  I get it every time.  The pizza cookie is hands down the best dessert in town."}
{"text":"Came here after doing some outdoor work nearby, and I never ate at the chain before. We arrived at the one o'clock hour and the place was still packed. 

We ordered up the garlic lime wings and Clark's meat pizza, the 17 inch size. For three of us it was more than adequate and we had to box the leftovers. 

The food quality was good and we enjoyed it a bunch. Service was good, considering how busy it was. The ambient atmosphere is enjoyable and I loved the swing jazz and the old time television shows on the monitor. 

I would return."}
{"text":"I was craving Oregeno's After Dark Alfredo is normally fantastic. I was unable to drive there, so I ordered it through door Dash.I also wanted to order an appetizer so I picked homemade guacamole which came with pizza chips. I had never had it before but it sounded fantastic. It was quite expensive, but I understand that you pay more for a delivery service, And guacamole in general. When the food came I was shocked that the pizza chips for the guacamole had chosen baked with a crap ton of raw onion. The chips were described as pizza chips, and never described a crap ton of raw onions on top. I would never ever order that again, and it still smells disgusting in my house with how many onions were on that pizza chip.The Alfredo was fantastic but the appetizer pizza chip with raw onion thing would never make me get delivery from them again."}
{"text":"The Thin Crust Cheese Pizza tasted like a cracker with cheese on it! I wouldnt recommend this place at all if you like cheesy pizza!"}
{"text":"Great take out!  We usually dine-in but decided to grab take out this time.  Very impressed with the portions and the offer of fresh cheese which I am spoiled by while dinning in.  I even tried something different from what I usually get.  I continue to be impressed by this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We love Oregano's. We hate their wait times. Their stuffed pizza keeps us coming back, despite having to wait over an hour most times. While their regular stuffed pizza is good, their stuffed pizza using their Big Rig sauce (from their Big Rig pasta) in place of the normal pizza sauce makes it something you can't get anywhere else. It makes the pizza a little creamy and gives it a bit of a spicy kick. The server is always a little confused when we order it this way, but they always comment that it looks amazing when they bring it out. And it always is. 

If you somehow have room left for dessert, their pizza cookies, slightly underdone, are the perfect way to end the meal."}
{"text":"30 minute wait for a table to order mediocre pizza. Not worth the wait or money."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town in my book!  Very casual spot with a quirky vibe to it but really good food. Huge portions so order accordingly"}
{"text":"I love it here!!
The pizza cookie is amazing and they keep adding new cookie flavors. The portions are huge and can easily be shared. So glad Oreganos is here in the west valley"}
{"text":"Really liked this place! Had the garlic cheese bread which was delicious but adding their marinara made it out of this world. THE BEST sauce I've ever tasted. We then had their pan pizza and I'm not a big \"pan\" fan but again it was THE BEST--of course I believe the sauce made it so. 
So, so good!"}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout...the to-go area was super busy but the gal working and bagging up all the orders was AWESOME!!! Totally managed the crowd waiting and did an incredible job!! One of the reasons I love Oregano's so much!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by EARLY 5:30 Friday to see if they were open yet. They were with an hour wait already which was fine I had planned to get take out anyways.  I was told it would be 30 minutes for take out ( no where to sit waiting for it ) I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir to kill the time. Crunched standing in a corner hovering over some poor people trying to eat. After 15 min of waiting the take out gal approached me with a glass of WHITE wine... I explained I ordered Pinot Noir this wasn't even Pinot Grigio?  She apologized and took it back.  10 more min I get the manager who tells me my Pinot Noir is $2.00 more so they will add that to my credit card?! I had to wait another 10 minutes before I got my glass of wine by then my food was ready.  I can get  that they are new and  they haven't got some of the wines straight.  What I don't get is making me wait and still charging me an extra $2.00, its the principle of charging me. If the food wasn't so good I wouldn't bother going back.  When I do it will be called in take out only. Customer service is what sets apart places these days.  I wonder once they sold their company out if  their customer service didn't go with.  The Pablo Picasso chicken salad and Pazzokie are amazing I have to give them that credit!"}
{"text":"Excellent service today friendly staff our waitress best we ever have Hannah Excellent service five stars"}
{"text":"My wife and i have eaten at several different Oregano locations in recent months, but we have been to the south Tempe venue the most, primarily due to other business that we have in that vicinity. I will say that regardless of the location, we have consistently received good service and excellent food at every visit, and Oregano's is quickly becoming one of our main staples for a good meal, and is now our number one choice for Italian cuisine. 
The prices are also very affordable - especially if ordering from their lunch menu. Personally, my favorite is the Bollo pasta (bowl o' pasta), which includes a breadstick and free refills - all you can eat. (I usually select the angel hair pasta option - yummy!) 
The atmosphere is very casual and relaxed. This location in Tempe is rather quaint, as there is a seating area in the main building that faces University Dr, as well as a separate building in the rear of the property. Between the 2 buildings is a large patio area with outdoor seating. They also have a moderately sized bar in the main building with open seating available, so they have all of the bases covered to accommodate your seating preference. All in all, Oregano's really offers a comfortable environment and dining experience, across the board, and I do recommend paying them a visit!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for the family and it was disgusting.  I equate it to something you would get In some kind of institution or school.  I was really embarrassed when I saw the looks on everyone's faces.  I will never order here again.  All I am thinking about is the countless pizza restaurants I drove past to get here and the money wasted.  Oh well..... I don't expect they will be crowded much longer...."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING on the menu here is absolutely delicious!! We go to oregano's a lot, much to my thighs' chagrin!! They give gigantic portions so splitting, especially the ENORMOUS salads, is always a good idea...  except for the chicken lasagna which is out of this world and I was able to eat the whole thing! They have the most phenomenal garlic cheese bread that is just off the charts!  Last night I tried the rigatoni pasta that comes with an incredible creamy spicy marinara and I ordered it with a side of sausage which is the best sausage I've ever had at any Italian restaurant!  That dish is my new favorite!!! I've included a photo!   The desserts are also unbelievable but I never have room for them and have to come for dessert randomly during the day without a meal!  The gigantic chocolate chip cookie comes warm in the pan it was cooked in with a gigantic scoop of ice cream! Absolutely decadent!  The service is always fantastic and even if there's a wait, it goes quickly and you are served almost immediately.  You really cannot go wrong ever at oregano's if you're craving some delicious Italian food!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the service was amazing.  This was my first time at this location and I was impressed.   I definitely will be back and I do recommend.  Their Chicago stuffed pizza is great!"}
{"text":"Took the whole town there and we stuffed ourselves with tastiest of pizza, eggplant parmesan, and bottomless drinks."}
{"text":"The pizza and pasta are awesome. Great service and decent prices. My entire family loves this place."}
{"text":"Rode our bikes to lunch at this newer oreganos location.  This American inspired italian local chain really has a yummy menu & a hip positive vibe through all locations from Tempe, old town, Bell Rd, or Tucson.

At this stop we sat at the bar with no wait and opted for a margarita and dos Equis for my hubby.  We ordered the simple salad & carne asada pizza.

The salad was large (even the half was a lot for 2 people) with just basic greens and like 2 croutons but maybe only $5 or something reasonable.

The pizza was I believe a puerto penasco named menu item.  After our long and sunny ride we were ready for something substantial and this did the trick.  Grilled carne asada thin crust with a yummy cilantro pesto to bring it together.  

Our service was friendly & professional even if the thin crust pizza took 40 minutes to come out."}
{"text":"My best girl friend I met up around 5:30 on a Monday night and waited 35 minutes for a table.  The wait area is small and shaped like a horse-shoe which makes a long wait awkward.

Once we were seated we got a nice big booth, gotta love the friendly hellos from the employees.  Mary was our server which she was very sweet and fun.  We started with the white sangria (me) and my friend got the dirty monkey. Both were served in a pint glass which is a big drink for just over $6.  We enjoyed the drinks very much.  We also had the toasted ravioli as an appetizer which was nice and crisp and hot.  For our mains she got the pesto veggie sandwich and I got the o-livo pizza which is basically Mediterranean flavors.  Her sandwich was huge and difficult to manage though a great value.  My pizza was thin crust and honestly a little bland.  Would have enjoyed more kalamata olives maybe? The crust was supposedly a little thicker than the typical but I found it to be blah and definitely not homemade.  

Of course the best part is the pizza cookie!! We got half chocolate chip and half peanut butter which was amazing. This was my friends first time trying pizookie and of course she loved it.

Pros: drinks, dessert
Cons: long wait, average pizza"}
{"text":"I typically have good to great experiences at the other locations so before writing this review, I thought I'd peruse some of the other write up's.  I can see that I'm not alone and that much of this is justified.

All of their locations are busy and for good reason:  the food is pretty good!  Typically, it's a longer wait during the dinner hours and especially on weekends.  That part, I get.  Went there this past weekend to celebrate a birthday (mine) at 5pm on Saturday.  Party of 6.  We were told the wait would be close to an hour.  It was already packed so that wasn't surprising.

The hostess came over after about 20 minutes of waiting and asked us if we wanted to sit outside or preferred inside.  We wanted indoors (it was 105 degrees!) but why wasn't this asked when we put our names in?  The outside area was virtually empty.  Had we been OK with eating outside, we may have already been seated!!!  

There were a few other parties waiting both inside and outside that were there before us.  Not that I counted but at Oregano's, it's a good idea to survey how many are waiting to give you an idea of how long your wait will be.  As they were all seated, we hoped that we would be up soon.  I understand that some tables can't hold 6 and so some smaller parties end up getting seated before us even though they arrived after.  As our wait continued, parties of 4, parties of 6, parties of 2 were all being seated before ours.  Everyone in our group was watching this process and agreed that we were passed over. 

A manager walked over and let us know that they were going to be clearing off a table for us momentarily, which they did, but she offered no apology when we asked if they were certain we weren't overlooked.  Clearly they have their own special math when it comes to determining \"first come, first served\".  You can't make reservations for a party of any size there so you're always at your own risk with a party larger than 2.  Again, the wait time didn't surprise me but the way they went about seating guests left many questions and much to be desired.

The food was its usual great self and our server was nice.  She took care of our appetizer.  It was a good meal.  Unfortunately, the memory and story of this particular visit is still going to be the horrible wait management.

I sent out a tweet about this before we left the restaurant, asking someone to contact me.  Two days later, I have not been contacted.  Just an FYI to Oregano's management: several hundred people saw it and I'll be tweeting out this review as well.

Last time we were there, our food was delayed because it was dropped on the floor on the way to the table.  It seems that it's always something at this location.  We may visit the others down the road but there are many other options in Gilbert if you're looking for a nice and fun place to eat."}
{"text":"This Oreganos is the best one in the valley. The bartender Beneal is my favorite person there. Whenever he is, whether in the bar or dining room, I purposefully sit with him. He's always so attentive and pleasant to talk to. He really cares about his patrons as well as his job and it shows. He is the most efficient bartender there and works with a sense of urgency. He's also entertaining to watch with his \"flare\" as he dances around the bar likes its nothing. Beneal keep it up! You are seriously the best. 10 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer of Oregano's, so I was excited to see a new one open up near my house.  I'm happy to say the food is just as fabulous and my server Jordan was fantastic. Very funny and on top of her game!  If you're into a good sandwich then I'd recommend the Stuffed Turkey. The full size was enough for dinner and lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I took my parents for Father's Day on Monday, the day after Father's Day and we got there at 5 pm. There was a 30 minute wait because the place was busy. Once we were seated our server Adam waited on us right away. He made great suggestions and we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and the garlic cheese bread to start. The portions are huge so we ordered on entree of the Alfredo the dark pasta. Everything was FANTASTIC!!  The service was excellent. I recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a great place to eat."}
{"text":"We always have a great experience when we come to Oregano's. Lately though I have been making my trips to Oregano's even more special by making it a Father and son trips. We would grab these two seats at the the bar right behind the hostess stand that are lower than the rest. Plus it makes it feel like they are \"reserved\" just for us. But it is Richard behind the bar that gives us that VIP experience. He is great with the customer service even when bar is full he always makes sure that we are are all good. It is because of Richard that makes us to continue to have these weekly father and son outings at Oregano's and sometimes we even bring the mrs."}
{"text":"Pasta is amazing. Really well cooked and good portions. Pizza is really good. Huge juicy wings with great flavor. Giant cookie with ice cream is a must."}
{"text":"I recently took 8 family and friends there for my Birthday Dinner. Everyone is very nice there and attentive. The Anti-pasta salad is my new favorite and I love the thin crust pizza. Friends had lasagna and chicken parmesan and all the food was really good. The only issue was our salads and garlic bread showed up very late but the staff was very nice about it and we were happy all in all. It's a fun, busy, vibrant place so expect to wait a bit. I prefer that actually - the food is fresh and good. We have been there 3 times now and will be back for sure. Great Prices too!"}
{"text":"I have been to many of the Oregano's. I was sorely disappointed in this one. No cold beer? Please?"}
{"text":"Great pizza - if you order the house salad be aware it's very large, but only lettuce & croutons."}
{"text":"We love oregano's!  My wife and I went there on our first date, and we go back for every special occasion.  We went there after I surprised her by proposing.  We go back for every anniversiary, and we went there the day we found our new home.  

Overall, it's a very important restaraunt for us and the staff are always very welcoming.  The last time we were there, they even gave us a pizza cookie.  Our waitress was Sara who was super nice.  She always made sure our glasses were full, and she was quick with the refills on my unllimited pasta bowl."}
{"text":"This is a tough one for me.  The food is great, but this night the service was terrible.  It took us almost an hour and a half just to be seated on a Tuesday night (after being told it would be an hour wait). Okay, not a good start.  But then even our waiter was terribly slow.  Took 20 minutes to even get us drinks on our table.  Food came out really slowly, luckily we had put in our order for the deep dish pizza while we waited, but even then our regular pizza took forever to come out.  The food was good, especially the pizza cookie, but to spend 3 hours at a pizza place where we gave our ENTIRE order to the waiter at his first appearance (in hopes of making up some time) is just too long.  I think this is a management problem, as I could tell our waiter was working his tail off, but just couldn't seem to keep up. 

Worst part? After waiting an hour and a half to be seated, our table was dirty (the floor) and it had a view into another section that was completely empty, must have just been closed for the night due to lack of staff.  Just hire some more people and open the restaurant up!"}
{"text":"The bartender was young and preoccupied. She was more worried about cleaning up for the night rather than servicing her customers!! we asked multiple times for my glass of wine. Our pasta dinner was dry so we asked for extra sauce. Again, she forgot and we waited 15 minutes before we asked again! Was disappointed that she actually charged us extra for the sauce after all that!  I will say our previous visit was much much better than this one."}
{"text":"Oreganos is a must for anyone visiting phoenix. Fun environment, friendly service and great food. Be sure to get a drink at the bar to fully enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"PLEASE!!! dnt waste your time here food NASTY service HOrrible. we came here because its right across the street from hm. if your looking for friendly go there, but good eats no! the mixed drinks are HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 thin crust pizzas to go. 1. Chicken Pesto 2. Sausage Mushroom 3. Plain Cheese.

I ate a few pieces of the Sausage Mushroom and something didn't seem right, but I couldn't place it.  I thought the Sausage had extra fennel seed which gave it a kind of spicy kick.  Then I tried the plain cheese and it hit me, the spiciness was from an insane amount of Oregano.   Guess this is why they called it Oregano's.  I am a big fan of Oregano, but this was nuts.  The pizza was almost a job to eat.  Not enjoyable at all.   Of the 7 people eating only 1 of us enjoyed the pizza cheese and sausage/mushroom pizzas.

The chicken pesto did not have the way over the top oregano flavor so it must have been in the tomato sauce and left out of the pesto sauce.  That pizza wasn't bad, but still average at best.  

I have had excellent thin crust from all over the country and based on the tons of reviews here I expected a lot.   This place was a let down for sure."}
{"text":"I love Oreganos, this restaurant is one of my favorite places to go for a quick bite. The reason for the one star review is for the AWFUL service given to my friend and myself. The server's name is Josh. He was rude from the moment we sat down and he greeted us. When I commented on his rude behavior, he told me that I could leave. Sorry but maybe he should leave, the whole service industry!"}
{"text":"Great lunch and good service. Nice to have an Oregano's in our 'hood.."}
{"text":"First visit here.  Looking for a pizza spot close to our hotel.  This place was awesome.  Although very small inside good atmosphere. We were told 1 hour wait which is what we are use to on a Saturday night.  Found a table in the bar so cut our wait.  Staff very friendly.  The pizza was amazing if you like thin crust pizza.  A little pricey but well worth it.  Will definitely go back here next time in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Took awhile for them to bring the food to the table. Thought the waitress had forgotten about us. But when we asked about it, she went back to check and brought it out to us. It was delicious."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Oregano's and honestly it was a bad experience. I ordered the Roasted Garlic Chicken Lasagna, my sister ordered chicken wings, and my mom ordered a sandwich. We waited over an hour to get the food with the server forgetting about us because she did not bothered to come back and ask if we needed any refill drinks. She came back and assume my mom had a water, I corrected her and told her it was 7UP. My Lasagna was delicious but while I was eating my sister noticed her chicken wings where dry as if they have been sitting in a counter for hours. To add on that our server never smiled and seem like she does not want to be here (which is fine nobody wants to work on a Memorial Day weekend just fake a smile and carry on with good quality service). I gave 3 stars because the service was not up to par and I was deeply disappointed. I try to frequent local restaurants but this time I would have preferred to go to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Thought I we were going to have our first \"negative\" experience here.  Odd as they have been consistent at the sun coming up each day.  Our order took forever and a day.  Turns out the waiter had a minor medical challenge and our order got pushed back.

They were very, very apologetic and covered the entire meal.  We love their thin crust pizzas, the attentive service and overrall festive atmosphere.  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I couldn't help but crave deep dish pizza on a regular basis. This place didn't disappoint me at all! Truly Excellent!"}
{"text":"The food is great! The bizookie makes life complete! Don took care of us and he is very personable and made the night awesome. The whole staff is fun and friendly. They always let me put extra fortune cookies in my purse... then I give them away to people... it make them happy. So it's like the gift that keeps on giving! Yay Oregano's!"}
{"text":"We have been to all the oreganos because it's my favorite place! We would normally drive down to the one on camelback and the food and service was always amazing! Kudos to those guys. I don't know if they are owned separately or not but the one on bell is subpar. We've been three times and twice we have been sick afterwards. The first time I thought maybe I just had a sour stomach, but the second time it happened I knew it was the food. It was within an hour that we started getting sick the most recent time. The staff is just okay and they must not be doing something right with the chicken because both times it was a chicken dish that we got sick eating. I called the first time to report it so no one else would get sick but they just said that it probably wasn't their food there. That's why I'm writing this instead this time. Go to another oreganos!! The food is great as long as you don't mind driving to another one."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome. Great staff and atmosphere. The food is delicious and huge portions. For me, Italian is comfort food. Definitely one of my favs here is Surprise. Ask for Kaylee, she's awesome!"}
{"text":"VERY impressed by Oregano's Tempe ! Today we ordered to go (Meatball Sandwich &Alfredo in the Dark). Unfortunately, the waffle fries were soggy cold and the bread was burnt. Luckily, the manager, Dominic, was very gracious and offered to remake the entire order. Thank you for such quick, exceptional customer service. Oregano's Tempe will continue to be our go to restaurant for great food!"}
{"text":"Fuck this place... I don't think people can tell time! Been here twice and the first time our wait time was doubled the second time my name was supposedly called twenty minutes ago... I sat right next to the door to make sure I hear the names but no avail since the girls are literally whispering it..!! Train your staff better!"}
{"text":"We visited yesterday and were a party of 16 that included an infant and two 2 year olds.  That should be enough to send any server sprinting in the opposite direction.  Ours however, handled it like a champ.  No drink refills were missed, every order was perfect and they even split up the checks with no problem.  The food was awesome!  With a party of this size, there was a variety of food ordered and all of it was great.  The salads are huge, the pizza was thin crust and was delicious.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have ate at the mesa, Tempe, Gilbert & Scottsdale locations. The mood is definitely better in the Tempe and Scottsdale locations. All have very upbeat and exceptionally friendly staff. You can't eat here without trying the pizookie ... The best by far!! No matter what location, be prepared to wait at least 30 mins and longer during popular dinner hours. Well worth your time!"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to agree with Blythe R.  This place is just not the same.  Servious, it was just ok at best. We ordered two \"guacatonis\" and they were both over cooked.  Some of the food was cold and the pasta mushy.  For sure I won't be going back to this particular Oregano's.  Oh, by the way, I have been here dozens of times. We even had a rehearsal dinner here.  It used to be a real favorite. It is just not the same."}
{"text":"I'd probably give them a 3 but the wait and waiting area are just plain stupid.  If you're going to have 45 minute waits, set up some misters or something and get someone to serve drinks or at least clean up after the people that were previously waiting (the Goodyear location does it).  It wouldn't be difficult, there were 4 girls working the hostess desk.

As for the food and drink, Pom O's Granate Margarita was weak, and the tall beer is overpriced (be nice to have the price actually on the menu too).

Every time I've eaten a salad at an Oregano's I've loved it.  This time no different.  Pizza was also good too but probably not worth the price.

Overall, I like the idea of Oregano's (the overall combo of food, drink, atmosphere), I just never leave there thinking \"hey, that long ass wait, combined with the price/value, and taste were totally worth it.\" But hey, that's just me."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Oregano's in the past, but this location really ruined it for me.  We were quoted a wait time of 30-35 minutes.  Not bad, right?  We figured for a party of three on a Friday night that was reasonable.  Well all we ended up doing was waiting... For 75 minutes.  We were waiting near the host stand and all we could hear was the unprofessional conversation amongst the hostesses which was a real turn off.  Then when we were seated, our server (a tall blonde) was in no way personal, attentive, or responsive.  It really seemed as though she didn't care at all.  In all honesty, we tipped out of obligation, not because our service was good.  In fact, our experience there was pretty awful.  The food was alright, but certainly not worth a 75 minute wait time.  I would honestly recommend avoiding this particular location.  I don't know what management is doing there, but they're doing something wrong.  It's really disappointing to be quoted a wait time then wait longer than twice that amount of time without any sort of compensation.  Do yourselves a favor and make your own pasta at home.  It'll be cheaper and probably better than the 'fine dining' at Oregano's."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and extremely generous portions. The menu is somewhat limited but still hard to make a choice. I knocked it down 2 stars because it's so unexplainable slow. You'll wait an hour to be seated and it'll be another hour before you're done. You'll go out the door very full and a lot later than you planned."}
{"text":"I've been to several Oreganos over the last few years.  Since I live close to this one, it's become my go-to pizza place.  Every time I've gone, service has been excellent.  I usually get take out since waits on busy nights can be over an hour.  Parking can also be a pain.  The thin crust specialty pizzas they have are a tad salty but delicious.  The pan pizza also is quite good, although I wished they have the specialty pizzas offered for both thin and pan style crust.  Oreganos has also been the only place I've found in Phoenix that serves THE Chicago deep dish pizza-the one that's several inches thick from the cheese and other yummy fillings.  Not even the Unos on Mill had that.  It takes a bit longer, but totally worth it!  Portions are generous.  Good food & value."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place HANDS DOWN.  I recommend the deep dish if you're crusty or the Beefstro Salad (the best salad in the world). Service is always great but parking can be a challenge.

Oh and don't forget the pizza cookie!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but the place or staff is not child friendly.

We visited for lunch with three toddlers, and one baby, the wait was long and they would not allow us to preorder in order to keep the kids happy.

Also, they only had one working high chair, we had to use a belt on another  since the strap was broken and they have to stack three high chairs to reach table level. We had to place the baby in her car seat on the floor, there was nothing to accomodate her.  And, there was another toddler next to us with no high chair.

Only good thing is that they gave the kids dough to play and that kept them all happy even when not necesarily safe."}
{"text":"Walked in and sat at the bar on a mellow Sunday afternoon. Walked by 4 employees on the way in and no one said hi. After a few minutes at the bar the cashier said he'd be with me in a bit. 15 minutes later with no menu or anything else and after a few more employees walked right in front of me at the bar with no recognition I left.  The cashier then apologized on my way out the door. (Sorry to late) 10 years ago this place was great. Not anymore."}
{"text":"my experience here is about 50/50. Sometimes my pizza is yummy and comes out correctly and other times it has been incorrect and soggy."}
{"text":"Well they could not get us a table. They could not say when we could get a table. While standing there wondering what to do a waitress was rude pushing us out of the way to get a dessert to another table. Hmmm. We are out of here."}
{"text":"Awful experience. Never got seated. Hostess forgot we were waiting outside. Then told us she forgot us and said our table was being cleaned. 15 minutes later we left still never being seated. Nobody else waiting in restaurant. Speaking to manager was useless. She did not acknowledge her hostess had erred, just said we had not waited as long as we said. Very bad experience. We have being going to Oreganos for over 20 years and I don't think we will return"}
{"text":"Came here for a 91st birthday. What a great spot! Food was terrific and the service was very good. You can't go wrong at Oregano's...always the best!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal here yet. Deep dish pizza is money. Thin crust is bomb. The wings are rockin. Giant cheesy bread tastes great & is a child's dream. Oreganos's favorite salad is flavorful. Pizza cookie is a dream. Only downside is there's usually a 45 minute wait because it's so busy."}
{"text":"LOVE Oreganos. My friends and I come here all the time, and they are so accommodating. Our recent waitress, Tamsen (?sorry if I spelled her name wrong!) was phenomenal. The staff is so friendly and the food is great."}
{"text":"GREATEST EXPERIENCE EVER, as soon as we walk in the whole staff greeted us with great smiles, it felt like my family was welcoming me home. Our server Courtney was very friendly, professional, and super fast. we never had to ask for a refill. the manager did walks to check up on us to make sure we where fine. lastly on our way out the whole staff wished us good night. I sure did."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing!  The cheesy bread was also very good. Had a side of wings and they were also really good.  We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing place to hang out with friends. Nice food, great quantity and I loved the ambience a lot."}
{"text":"We just left because we tried to sit on the patio and enjoy a lunch and The Bee situation on the patio was out-of-control! They were swarming! The waitress seemed uninterested in helping us or being courteous about moving us to a table inside.  We boxed up our salad and decided to leave.  But when received our bill she took a long time to bring us change and we only gave her a $20 bill. And when she did return with our change it was short by $.55 and she said it was hard to find change???? We tipped and left! Not going to this location anymore"}
{"text":"Not only does Oreganos have a cool vibe and atmosphere...the food is excellent!!! We dined with Matt the day before and had a great time.Matt was so much fun and recommended some great food. Came back and sat at the bar and were blown away by the top notch service from Tony! Recommend seeing him in the bar for a great night out."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here Wed 3/20/13. I want to say my wife lost her diamond wedding band when she took it off a moment. Her diamond engagement ring was at Jewelers getting blinged, I found the ring had it bonded to the diamond ring ......(she thought lost forever very upset) Back to Oreganos, our Server was awesome, Pablo Picasso Salad fresh, amazing mix of spices and vegs, Big Rig w/chix a grat stand by.... as we shared our server ( Forgive me think was Mike) catered to our every need, you don't get service like this at some fine dining places. Well time came to show my wife her \"new ring\" I decided to propose to my awesome wife got down on the one knee and Pow Popped the question..... She ws amazed by the ring, but not without the round of ceremony applause would it have been complete.... With out the atmosphere, awesome food, service, and manager.... Oh yeah... The manger I believehis name was Dennis ... Comped our check.. Told him it was unnecessary as we are already Married lol ... He insisted thanked us for choosing Oreganos for our special night ..... GUEST FOR LIFE!!!!!"}
{"text":"The boom dip is amazing and I had the traditional thin crust pizza with sausage pepperoni onions peppers which was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here waiting for the catering order I placed last Thursday. I called and confirmed the order, and that the location was correct last week. When I got here, they didn't have my order on file. Two ladies up front said they were sure I called the wrong location. I had to show them my call history to prove this is where I called. Needed the food for a big company meeting and now we're screwed because the employees here can't do their jobs. Currently waiting for them to rush our food so I can at least show up with something. Very disappointing experience for our company."}
{"text":"What stands out at Oregano's is the service !  We had to wait for one hour and sat at the bar to have an appetizer. The bartender was ouststanding.  She saw to it that our glasses were never empty and that our appetizer was delivered in a timely manner.  Our server was very efficient. She kept an eye on our table in spite of her busy schedule.  As to the food, it was average.  Both pizzas were salty and the ingredients could be easily peeled off the dough.  I will never go back to Oregano's for that reason."}
{"text":"Everyone should be lucky enough to have an Oregano's in their neighborhood.  Thin crust pizza is very good and travels well.  Pan pizza is not particularly my thing, but friends and family vouch for it.  I think the salads are a little weak - I would like to see more vegetables besides lettuce or spinach.  Pizza wise the Ol' Mexigana is my go to - nice amount of spice and an overall good combo."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my top 10 favorite places to go. The food is amazing!  There's a delicious adult beverage there called a Dirty Monkey that makes for an even more fun experience."}
{"text":"Wish I could have tried this location but when I called to place a pick up order the girl who answered was less than thrilled. I got a \"ya sure what do you want\" in a sarcastic tone. I work in the service industry, I get it's the last hour of the evening and you want to go home, but at least fake some customer service over the phone."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place.  The food is so good and generous portions of everything.  The servers are all so great too.  So happy you came to Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Oregano's, at ANY of their Phoenix-area locations, is wonderful.  Great food, no matter what you order.  Love all the pizzas, the pastas are great, the salads are tasty, and the pizza cookie is epic!  This isn't gourmet or fine dining, but for a casual meal it's great food, and the ambiance and service are great, too."}
{"text":"We went last night for the first time to the queen creek location.  It took 30min to get food. Then they brought out the chicken parm.  It was like shoe leather.  The manager said sorry and walked away. Wont be going back there any time soon."}
{"text":"The thin-crust was super-thin, possibly the thinnest in Tempe. It also tasted like cardboard, the finest cardboard in Tempe. Definitely more \"bistro\" than \"pizza bistro\" I will not return."}
{"text":"Great service, sangria, and even better deep dish pizza.  Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Super good food, wonderful customer service. There was a wait but really with it. I enjoyed the thin crust pizza while the husband and kids went for the deep dish. Must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Wait time way too long. Great food. Kind of pricey but all in all good place. I usually sit at the bar because the wait is too long and the bar is open seating. Had awesome service most times but went back a week later and had bad service."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch last week, I do gotta say is a must try. Pizza and pasta was great. I'm new in town and I will for sure be back. The staff incredibly friendly!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is wonderful the staff is very friendly. Everyone greets you as you walk to your table and our server always had a big smile on her face. Great time."}
{"text":"My second time here. And must to say. Amazing !

At the first time I order starter and a pizza.   One. The starter was huge.  I could but even eat the pizza.  So meals here are huge.  And amazing. The pizza is the best !!!"}
{"text":"The wait time is usually at least an hour after ordering your food, so be prepared to be waiting a while. If you are bringing young kids, this can be difficult! The kale Caesar salad is my favorite thing on their menu! The cookie desert is famous, but it taste frozen not fresh. This place is always packed and loud, pricey for the quality and food."}
{"text":"Yum!!  Great service from Michael tonight 1/21! Food is always great and I love how friendly everyone is at this particular location. We will of course be back!"}
{"text":"I would have given Oregano's five stars but I have to take one off because of the one negative about the restaurant.  The wait!.  I tend t get impatient and I don't like waiting for more than fifteen minutes to eat. 

Other than that, Oregano's is great.  There is not one thing that I have had there that I did not think was excellent.  I love their meatballs and wings.  And they also have outrageous deserts too."}
{"text":"I have gone here because it's is close to my house. Truth be told, the parking is atrocious, seating is limited, service is slow, pasta is awful. If you order spaghetti, you get a ton of noodles with a little bit of marinara that is way overwhelmed by the taste of oregano. If you order lasagna, expect it to be dry and tough. Even with a knife I had a challenge eating it. I go an extra half mile to the drug store and get a frozen Stouffer's for 1/4 the price and way more delicious. You know how left over pasta in the fridge gets? The pasta soaks up all the moisture and it gets dry and tough? Well, that's what they serve here. I don't order pizza because I can't stand their over oreganoed marinara sauce, so there seems no sense in trying it."}
{"text":"I love the pizza but there is always atleast a 45min wait for a table. But I have learned that you can pre-order your pizza so it will be ready close to the time you get seated. But their salads and deep dish is really good."}
{"text":"We were seated outside and under the table and along the wall were a bunch of dead roaches. This was around 7 in the evening so they had been there all day. Very gross!!! The menus also had dried food all over them. With all the other choices to pick from Oregano's needs to get this place cleaned up if they want people to continue to eat here."}
{"text":"We love this place. Mostly young staff, all are very polite and attentive. One of our favorite places to eat and bring visitors for an enjoyable meal. The food is great as is the beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"Always a good option. Lots of great pizza options and sandwiches. Boom Dip is a must and the Shishito Peppers were awesome!"}
{"text":"Don't try and do take out with this place in less you want to wait all night.  Called tonight at 6pm to order a pasta dish (no pizza) and was told it would not be ready until 8:30pm - no place is worth waiting over 2.5 hours for a take out order.  Called STREETS OF NEW YORK, ordered the exact same thing and got it delivered in 30 minutes.  DON'T even try and place a take our order with Oregano's!!!  They should not even offer take out if it is going to take that long to make something that I have to go and pick-up.  Done with this place."}
{"text":"This was my first visit at this location. My associate and I sat at the bar and received great service by the bartender (cant recall his name). We ordered calamari, a side salad, and wings (all flavors). The food was good like usual. The selection of whiskey is limited but that's all oreganos. He enjoyed a jim bean rye on the rocks and I had a dos equis 16 oz draft. The place was crowded and loud during the lunch rush. This location is smaller than others. 

Typical oreganos experience."}
{"text":"Absa-jokin-lutely awesome!  Spectacular service, fabulous food... Definitely a must do for pizza!  Loved the antipasti salad too!!! Numero One-o deep dish -- worth the wait, and the chocolate Cookie Pizza with vanilla ice cream. Awesome. Loved it, and will go back, for sure."}
{"text":"First time there and the wings and pizza were excellent the waitress was also very nice and patient with us will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"Was afraid it would be just another generic chain with stale salads and overly greasy frozen-fried food. Nope! Freshest salads, crazy-huge portions (we all took our leftovers and enjoyed them for dinner the same day). Next time we are in Arizona, we will definitely do Oregano's again. And again. It was a yummy and overall great experience."}
{"text":"I want to start put by saying I wanted to take my friend to eat there because I love the food. She had never been. When we arrived we were told it would be an hour wait. It was about 45 min no problem. We were seated and our waiter came over asked for our drinks we ordered at same time we were ready and hungry. My wine came quickly and my friend got a water. We noticed other tables getting there food but not us. We ordered simple things but still no food or our waiter. We asked another server if we could see the manager another half hour mind you we have now waited 1 and 1/2 hours for our food. The server came and said we had an issue in the kitchen we will take care of bill. Low and behold our original waiter appeared and handed me the bill for my glass of wine. Very dissatisfied with this service and never saw the manager won't go back to this location again."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience! There are two wonderful girls here who are usually our servers and they are absolutely amazing. Always so nice and prompt, they never forget to check back on me and my husband, and our order is always correct and IF there is ever an issue, they are always willing to fix it immediately. I wish I took down their names they are amazing and hope to get either one of these two every time we go!!!"}
{"text":"I  always take first-time Phoenix visitors here and they instantly think I am (and all of Phoenix)  waaay cooler than I actually am.  Has a great vibe, always jamming the jazz music and has friendly waiters.  And don't forget the Pizzookie! (sp?)  If you are planning on ordering deep-dish and aren't wanting to make a day of it, you may want to peruse the menu online and call your order in, or at least  right you get there (even at typically slow times, there's always a bit of a wait for a table)."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this concept. Having been to their location at Tatum and Cactus several times we decided to try this one out last night for dinner. The bruschetta was as great as always and the barbecue chicken pizza was fantastic. What was truly memorable though was the service, topnotch in a pizza joint. You don't find that every day."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. You can't go wrong with their pizzas. Although I don't recommend getting cheese stuffed... you'll be drowning in cheese!"}
{"text":"One of the only places in the valley that makes a Stuff-Chicago style pizza - Which is my favorite.... The pizza is great  - the place has a nice ambiance, but sometimes 
the music is a bit loud even during the day for younger kids (4-6yp) or if you want to talk..."}
{"text":"Love this location for Oregano's too.  Show up early or expect to wait quite a while for a table.  If you have to wait grab a glass of Sangria at the bar, tasty!    They have a great outdoor patio section and in the cooler months a fireplace to keep you warm.  From the menu order Wings and Bruschetta for the apps and Pizza or the Chicken Alfredo for your entree.  If you're ordering the cookie pizza thing for dessert make sure you let your server know early because it takes a while to prep."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food and atmosphere is amazing although theres always atleast a 30 minute wait the food and service you recive is definitely worth it all. For first timers i recommend the big rig pasta, pablo picaso salad,lasagna and of course finishing it all off with a pazookie."}
{"text":"Wonderful as always easy to check-in in advance. I would suggest that if you get the zani zini \"bread bowl with pasta\" that you order extra sauce. Over all very happy."}
{"text":"Bucca de beppo WHO!?! If you want bland flavor then by all means goto bucca! OREGANOS is hands down the better choice for Italian food between the two not to count the decor is nice and the service is on point. Never been to oreganos before? Try it before you deny it."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing tonight! We started off with the zucchini and the Oregano's favorite salad. Both were fresh and excellent. For our main dish we ordered the deep dish pepperoni and black olive pizza. I'll tell you, I have never enjoyed a pizza so much in my life! Megan was our server and was so nice and sweet. Very attentive service even though they were busy. Outstanding Oregano's!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Thursday evening at 5:30 and had to wait for a table for 2 for about 20 mins. Sat for another 15 before a waitress came by to ask our drink selections and we both ordered the Long Island Express and then waited another 10 mins before getting our drinks which then i had to ask for a glass of Coke (but they serve Pepsi) to make our drink correct cos the bartender seemed to forget it or not enough was put in...the proportions were all wrong. I ordered the jumbo chicken parm which it wasn't.  Small piece of chicken with pasta and not enough sauce. Hubs ordered the sausage and peppers and he got juicy sausage and plenty of sauce. The place was so loud as so many kids were crying yelling or screaming which made the experience even worse. Maybe we will go back when the holidays r over and see if we get a better experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food at Oreganos!!! Not a whole lot of healthy options but if you like Italian food- it's definitely worth a try! The specialty drinks are delicious and affordable, the prices of the food can't be beat, and portion sizes are more than fair. They have a kids menu for the little ones as well!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago this is WAY better pizza than anything I've had in Chicago. The Clark st pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"Word to the wise: do not plan on eating here during a lunch rush during your hour lunch. You will not be able to eat your food. These restaurants are always very crowded with limited space. It's a fun place to eat though if you pick the right time. They have some good lunch specials and I enjoy their sandwiches (get them on focaccia!) and pastas. They have slices for lunch which are a great deal, very cheap and you won't have to wait an hour to eat pizza. For some reason I really like their side salad...it's definitely got more oomph than a normal side salad. Items I enjoy: *Guaca Tony: this is a great but filling appetizer, a huge bowl of guacamole with a giant large size pizza crust, yum!* Italian fried potatoes, AKA potato wedges: really yummy seasoned goodness, served with their sandwiches unless you upgrade to their sweet potato fries which pack quite the punch, sweet and very spicy* Mrs. Gibbilini's Spinach Salad: spinach, candied pecans, gorgonzola cheese, red peppers, bacon, mandarin oranges, and a unique asian dressing...very different flavor but I got hooked* dinner salad/side salad: spring mix, tomatoes, red onions, gorgonzola cheese, and the dressing of your choice...a light yummy salad to pair with your Italiano* sandwiches I enjoy are the Turkey Stuffed, Veggie Wedgie, and the Meatball Sandwich...again, you should really try these on their focaccia*the pesto penne bake: bread bowl with pasta in it! Yummy!*alfredo the dark: a spicy creamy alfredo type of pasta*THE PIZZA COOKIE:  1/2 pound cookie fresh baked covered in ice cream! Bring room for this baby!"}
{"text":"It's so good and I love their food. The service is very good and the people are very polite. The manager Garnet is very friendly, sweet and attentive. I will always come back to this place for some of my favorite meals."}
{"text":"This. Is. My. Favorite. Italian. Eatery.  My mouth is watering, and waistline increasing as I write this.  TMI? I don't think so. There is not a single item on the menu that I won't eat. I sat outside in the hot weather gratefully for 30 minutes. I didn't mind. I knew once inside, I would be in my desert oasis. Thank you for not being in California. I don't think I could afford to buy more clothes. Just kidding. Please come to California! I don't care anymore, I will buy new fat pants everyday.   be with me forever. I'll never let you go......."}
{"text":"Ok, Spouse and I sat at the bar tonite ordered an appetizer that took forever to come out. Can't blame the kitchen , because it was sent back for being too cold. Came back again lukewarm. Pasta dishes were also sent back for the same reason. I believe there were just too many distractions for our server to deal with. She was very nice but our meal was not a priority for her. We like the restaurant but the service will keep us from coming back."}
{"text":"3 and a half stars. 

I finally had my first ever Valley Oregano's experience tonight. You'd think I'd have gone to the one on Camelback ages ago, because, well, I live minutes away from it, but no, it was the Tempe location which sucked me in. 

Ok, not necessarily sucked me in. I drove my ass all the way out there to meet some friends for dinner, but still. 

Wait was an hour which kind of bit. We were tempted to just go to Thai Basil instead but as I never had Oregano's we persisted and stayed put. Once seated, we ordered things that I won't be eating anything close to resembling for the rest of the week: the spinach salad (ok, maybe I'd eat that), the cheesy bread, a large thin crust pesto pizza, and the pizokie for dessert. I'm a huge deep dish fan (I know, I know, thin crust is how real Italian pizza is) so I'm going to reserve major potential star wattage for when I actually have one of those. 

I thought the pesto thin crust was pretty decent - didn't blow me out of the water but it was good. The salad was flavorful and the cheesy bread was decent, but the pizokie dessert thing was awesome. Maybe it's because I I haven't had one of these since BJ's back in college (which is a longtime ago), but it was pretty damn delicious. Scene was pretty much college-y, loud, and full of \"like, I was all\"s, but duh, what else is it going to be.

All in all, almost all stuff not good for me but whatever. Now that I've finally had my Oregano's experience I can go on with my life. Nothing like a local pizza chain holding you back."}
{"text":"So I ordered the Pesto Penne Baked with meatballs, and I have to say wow. The portions were huge, I could barely eat 90% of my meal, but every bite was worth it. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Was delicious. The waitress was beautiful inside as well as out. Service was spectacular, food came out right away. Not gonna lie had to send the meatballs back to warm up a bit more but overall will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Won't ever be back to this place. We sat at the bar and waited and watied and waited. Bartenders would look over at us and that's about it. This is the second time for horrible service at this location. Will not be going back nor will several others that used to go to this place. Glad the one in Cave Creek has great service."}
{"text":"This one just opened a few days ago and age for the first time today. Did a call in order for pickup and it was an hour and a half wait for our pickup time! Hot good was hot and salad cold, ready at pickup time. Crowded but very good."}
{"text":"We love the family favorite spot!! We are not big on waiting for tables so we intentionally jump to Oreganos when we are ready for \"Linner!\"  Love their Oreganos Favorite salad & love their Bellinis!!  Their staff is kind and helpful!!"}
{"text":"Second time we have stopped by with an excessive wait time. Almost 2pm with people leaving and told we would have to wait up to 20 minutes to sit down for lunch. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing. The food is very good, but the service! .. it's like being in Vegas.. you drink a little bit of your beverage and boom they refill it.  We were taking food to go and the waitress got us extra sauce just  because she didn't want it to be dry when we reheated it.  I could go on and on but Wow.  I highly recommend them and the food was great too!  
ps. I don't have any association with them in any way.. I just appreciate being treated so well.  
Our waitress's name was Andrea and she Rocks!   What a star!!!"}
{"text":"Waiting,  waiting,  waiting. Don't they have staff.
Staff standing around doing nothing. This sux."}
{"text":"Was very pleased to hear from the corporate office.   That's the customer service we love!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Seems weird to order wings at an italian joint but they're amazing!!! Have never had a bad meal at Oreganos!"}
{"text":"Love their food , but they need to get there act together! Came in tonight wait was 45 minutes. Ok I'm hungry and take out was to be 20 minutes. 45 minutes later I get my food. As I stand there the manager set someone who left the premises and complained they weren't called! He sat them ahead of those waiting. A group watched this got pissed and left. 
Once again love the food and help but need a better way to accommodate timing! 
Stay away on Friday and Saturday nights!"}
{"text":"After a full day of meetings on a Saturday, per my friend's recommendation,  we tried Oregano's. She knows I love wings and she thought theirs were pretty good. 

Upon arrival, parking was a bit cramped and I could see tons of people waiting outside. I'm thinking I just want a drink and food, no wait and this looks like a 30+ minute wait. Fortunately, open seating was available at the bar, so we grabbed 2 seats! 

Corina help is while at the bar and was attentive but not overbearing with her service. She recommended the peach Bellini for a drink and my friend agreed! They were pretty good! I ordered wings with the Italian Gold sauce and they were good with a side of fries! My friend had a Jr. Caesar salad that was huge and she enjoyed it. 

Overall great food and drinks, fast service but crowded with iffy parking!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise ..the soup was to die for..huge meatball fresh mozzarella ..the pizza was very good as well..will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"The food here is always good. I recommend the pizza but the pasta, salads, wings, and desserts that I have tried are all excellent as well. 

Minus one star because dining here always takes FOREVER. There is always, ALWAYS a wait. If you are ordering a deep dish pizza (which is just so good it is worth the wait) it takes about 40 minutes once the order has been placed for it to cook. 

Service is a little spotty. Sometimes it is great, sometimes it is mediocre. 

My last visit the server pretty much tossed the water glasses on the table as he was running by, causing the water to slosh over making a mess which we mopped up with napkins. He took a really long time to come back and take the order (remember we're already working with a long wait to be seated and a long prep time, we don't need extra waiting), and when the pizza came out he forgot to bring plates? And when we asked for plates mumbled something about \"oh I'll go try to find them\"? He did find and deliver the plates but really?? The food was typical delicious Oregano's though, at least that's consistent. The portions are huge so count on yummy leftovers the next day as well."}
{"text":"Do not go to this location. I've been going to the scottsdale and Shea location for years and the food and service there are just better in every way. Maybe a managerial thing? Let's start with probably the worst hostess I've ever dealt with at any restaurant. Went at almost 9pm still a little busy. She told us the wait was 15 mins but I saw at least 3 tables that just haven't been cleaned so I say we will wait. Then she points to 2 open bar stools and says you can sit there if ya want. No thanks. We wait 15 for the tables to get cleaned, and we go to the little middle section with probably 4 out of 6 booths open and she sits us at the tiny table with 2 little chairs? Um no we'll take a booth. She rolls her eyes throws the menus on the booth table and walks away. Just rude in my opinion. Your job is customer service. Wash dishes if you hate dealing with people. Been in the restaurant business for 20 years and would never hire someone like this. Service was good. Pizza had a giant burnt bubble but it wasn't bad. Meatballs were also good. Shrimp scampi had no taste though. Pizooki was good but that's hard to mess up. Take the 15 min drive to the better location on Shea."}
{"text":"Average Italian restaurant.  They have some great dishes and others that are just OK.  I'm from St. Louis where we have a large Italian population and the restaurants to prove it.  When I moved down to Phoenix in '05 I was disappointed to find very little in the way of tasty Italian fare, so  I was excited the first time I went to Oregano's because I had heard so many rave reviews for it.  

What I have come to realize is that Oregano's is the \"nice restaurant\" for the Mill Ave. area.  More likely than not, this is where everyone who goes to ASU wants to eat on their birthday.  Chances are this is the nicest place they've eaten because they A) don't have a car or B) refuse to leave their Mill-box.  

I'm not saying don't go, just don't expect to be blown away.  If you don't mind driving for better food, I'd check out Rigatony's in Chandler."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst oregano's ever!!!!!!! If not skipping you in the line for others,  having tweens standing at hostess stand \"oh, I'm not working\" to placing you at a table that hasn't been cleaned with trash below the table. Not to have our food spit on, we left!"}
{"text":"Should have read the yelp reviews before coming.  Long wait -absolutely spot on.  If they say 45 minutes, add an hour.  Didn't get  pizza thins to snack on as one yelp reviewer commented, didn't get pizza dough balls for the kids to play with. Marinara sauce seemed really spicy, no one in my party could eat much of it.  As I picked the restaurant upon my husbands rave reviews, and I was paying for dinner, I was disappointed to see so many half full plates at the end of the meal. 

On the positive side- 
The appetizers were phenomenal - garlic cheesy bread and pesto bruschetta so no one left hungry.  The gooey cookie and ice cream were a big hit with the kids.  I ordered the tuna sandwich and it was delicious. Walnuts add a nice crunch.  The bellinis were sweet and refreshing. 

Wait staff was great - Josh is very competent, efficient, friendly and personable.  Wait times and spiciness brought down my scores, atmosphere and attitude of wait staff and management might bring me back."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza was soggy in the middle and all the cheese and topping would slide right off. We ordered the numero one-0.. too many toppings.. really disappointed after waiting 1 hour in line and then having to eat our salad with plastic utensils because they ran out of silverware.. been to the location in Gilbert which was a completely different experience. Kind of sad when we hyped this place up for out of state family to be let down. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Our server PJ was AMAZING! He was super nice and sweet and the manager Rosie was awesome too! The staff was super friendly but PJ was my favorite! Super cute! We're definitely going back there next time and definitely asking for PJ again! Food was great! Everybody must come to this oregano's and ask for PJ! Go PJ woo hoo!"}
{"text":"Kay was a great server, the pizza was perfect and the place did have a pleasant atmosphere! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We have been coming to Oregano's for years. And this new location did not disappoint. Thin crust is the best."}
{"text":"What the hell man! What genius decided to change the Italian Wedding soup!? Went from a great broth based soup to gelatinous goo. This pizza crust bowl is a ridiculous gimmick that further ruins the flavor of the soup.  We will not be back for the soup.  Something else maybe..."}
{"text":"We recently located a new Oregano's on South Dobson in Chandler near Germann. The CEO, Mark Russell, not only greeted us at the door but hand the staff provide quality service and food to our group prior to being open. We happened to pull into the parking lot for a matter of minutes when we were so warmly greeted by Mark. He never mentioned he was the CEO at any givenn time. This didn't stop him, he opened the door and waited on us as if he were part of the staff. I will be a lifetime customer of this Oregano's location along with my group of friends and clients. Did I fail to mention he did so all free of charge? Yes, the food and service was gievn to us for free, just by offering to come in and try out their new location. (They were not open yet) The food was incredible, best pizza I have eaten. My fiance is a pizza connoisseur and he has none better than Oregano's. Thumbs up all around!!! Thanks again for the excellent hospitality and gourmet pizza! Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"Please do not believe the hype. We have gone to Oreganos twice before posting a review like this. The first trip was a Saturday night and was super busy. The food was late to our table, cold, undercooked, but the customer service was so good that we needed to give Oreganos another shot. This time the food was mediocre at best, as was the customer service. We were disappointed by the shrimp scampi and lasagna, but the pizza did not fail us. 
Summary - unless you want pizza, you might want a different restaurant."}
{"text":"I have gotten take out here many times, and it is usually good. last night I got a combo meatball & sausage side, & a kickbutt garlic bread. The garlic bread was a soggy, garlic butter soaked mess which needed to be put under my broiler before eating. At about 2:00 am I woke up and the worst explosive diarrhea  ever!! I suspect the garlic bread, as I have had the meatballs & sausage before, and they were fine. I had to wait about 10 minutes for my food even though I got there 25 minutes after I phoned in the order, and was told 20 to 30 minutes on the phone. The girl who took care of me was high or something. She didn't have a nickel to make correct change, as I paid cash. And while I was waiting she put someone else's bill and credit card in front of me and asked me to sign it. WTF???"}
{"text":"We have been coming to the Gilbert location since it opened and always have an awesome experience. Food and service is always great...We always request Anthony for our server, he is amazing! Always goes above and beyond every single time we come in & treats us like family! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This was a 3 for service (or maybe a 2?), and 5 for food.  

We met a few friends here for dinner, and the pizza was really, really good.  However, the cookie + ice cream concoction for dessert????   Holy moly.

Yeah.  Yes.  More.  Again."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place! The food is great but the service is not. I called to place an order for pickup at 8:30pm. Just two salads that's it. They told me it wouldn't be ready until 9:45pm, no joke. Are you freaking kidding me? The waitress said it was because of their ordering system. I don't know their system but it seems like a terrible one if you have to wait over an hour for salads."}
{"text":"Pizza cookie is a must!!!! Everything else is delicious as well but be warned the portions are giant!!"}
{"text":"We went last night for my Birthday dinner! Food took awhile to come out and when eggplant came was not good and barley warm. Then got the cookie dessert as that's why we go there and it came out in a aluminum bowl thing!!! Really was horrible and so disappointed. Ask server what happened as wasn't same and as warm, said they were out of skillets and didn't want us to wait to wash them. Really???? This visit was very disappointing! Server was really trying though on his part, as not his fault!"}
{"text":"I'm really wavering between three and four stars. I really like the menu, they have great choices, unfortunately almost everything on the menu is very spicy. It would be great if they could offer some menu items that are not so spicy, not all of us can handle it, LOL."}
{"text":"I've been back twice since my original review and I wanted to say that this wasn't a fluke. I've gotten (split with someone) the meatball sub each time and split a salad.

Each one is better, and seemingly bigger, than the next!

If you have dinner plans, I wouldn't eat lunch here!

Can't wait to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't give 5 stars to a chain but Oreganos has hands down the best sausage (appetizer) and amazing deep dish pizza.  I also highly recommend the cheesy garlic bread.  The menu has a lot more but these items are on another level.  I've been to a couple locations and it's usually a fun atmosphere with good service."}
{"text":"Oregano's may be a chain but they do nothing wrong.  First and most important their pizza crust is flaky and delicious and true to the claim close to a Chicago like pizza.  Menu offers a nice variety of apps, salads, pastas, and pizzas.  Combined with large drinks . . . I need to go back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! A must stop when we are out here for Spring Training!  Great service and atmosphere! Cheese Garlic Bread- to die for, Anti-Pasta Salad- so fresh and delicious, Pesto Pasta Bake- bomb, Pizza- awesome, Hot Cookie with Ice Cream- amazing!"}
{"text":"Oreganos is always a favorite of mine! I love getting the bollo pasta (which is refillable) and a side of Brussels sprouts for a filling meal. Meals are not overally expensive and are easy to share. 
Sometimes the wait and the parking are pretty busy but if you are patient they will always take care of you!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Hands down best pizza in Phoenix. And that means something because, ya know, I'm a total pizza addict.
Service: incredible. Waiters, manager, all of the above went over and beyond to make sure our dining experience was pleasurable.  
Food: again, incredible. We ordered the deep dish pizza with black, green olives, mushrooms and it was amazing. The crust (as all other reviews will say) is mouth watering. Definitely the place if you're coming here looking for  deep dish. 

This place is crowded, always a line and food is cooked to order. So if you're in a rush, order to go."}
{"text":"I was visiting the area and my two friends took me here.  We had the fried zucchini sticks w/ranch they were very good and crisp.  Two of us had the Rigatoni which was outstanding, very well seasoned and just enough cheesiness in relation to pasta. The third person had spaghetti
with huge meatballs, all three of us took home leftovers for lunch the following day."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Anytime I'm in AZ I must go to Oregano's!!! The food is delicious you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorites are the salads they are huge portions and super yummy! You must try the Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad! The pizza's take a long time but they are definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday with some of my girlfriends and as usual the food was excellent. Surprisingly this one by PV mall did not have a wait on Saturday afternoon. Usually I try and avoid Oregano's due to the wait. But if you can get in without waiting an hour it is definitely worth a stop.

My favorite here is the thin crust chicken and pineapple pizza. It might not sound awesome but it is! You should give it a try"}
{"text":"I have to say we experienced the worst service we have ever had anywhere this afternoon at Oregano's. Once we got our drinks and placed our order (one 16\" pizza) which took a good 30 minutes, our waitress did not come back to our table to check on us at all. After an hour and a half, my husband got up, found her and asked about how much longer, at which point she said she was conveniently just going to check on our order. Five minutes later we received our lukewarm thin crust pizza which I'm sure would have been very good had it not been sitting under the warming lights so long. As it was, the crust was soggy in the middle , and the pizza was not very warm. Refills on the drinks did not happen until we got up and walked over to the drink station, and sought out another server to assist. Not once during any of the few times we saw our server was she pleasant. I got the distinct feeling we were an inconvenience. This was not an experience makes us want to return, and cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Pretty dayum good pizza. Not very fast but i thought the food was worth the wait. Try the itallian sausage. I also suggest the Bellini. I was debating giving 5 stars because I found the place quite charming, nice chill outdoor patio, but my date was upset the bathroom was out of papertowells and I didn't like the fact there was only 1 stall in the ladies room in patio. But overall, I will definitely love to come back again."}
{"text":"It seems a lot bigger than the other locations, I always forget that this place is here, because the location is somewhat new. We visited for late lunch on a Sunday and shared the Caesar (Jr size) salad and wings... Both delicious and enough for 2-3 ppl.. I was hungry and didn't believe that the Jr. size would be enough, but it was! Had my food with a side of beer, what's not to like about this yummy lunch.  

The servers and hostess were both pleasant and very attentive! 

I will definitely remember to come back to this location soon!"}
{"text":"Every time I am in Arizona I head to Oreganos! You can't beat great tasting food, superb service, and a tasty menu. I've been accustom to ordering the big rig (amazing) but branched out to different menu items such as the el diablo (spicy)! The service is always welcoming and the manager is always helping out the staff. Bartender Ben is top notch and very charismatic. He won't let you leave hungry! Make sure to say hi to Edgar through the kitchen window! 

."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Raquel is such a friendly welcoming face and Adam rocks the rest!!"}
{"text":"It there anything bad you can say about Oregano's????  I have been enjoying their food since 2001...and I have never eaten anything there that I have not loved.  All of their pizzas, salads, pastas are delicious!!!!  Their bellini is yummy!  And of course, you can't leave without ordering a pazookie!!!!! MMMMM...it's like heaven in your mouth!!!!  Expect to wait and have difficulty finding pakkring at this location...especially during peak  hours......it is still well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Been going here since I first moved to Arizona. My favorite pizza and LOVE the pizookies!!! Anytime my family comes out here they always want to come here. Recommend this place to everyone whose looking for good food!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here! They have great lunch time specials, but try their vino bambino salad (ITS AMAZING). Their pizzas are really good too! For Dessert make sure to have their pizookie!"}
{"text":"Off-peak times are best for Oregano's because this place gets busy. Food is good, service is aight but the pizzookie is where it's at. One thing Oregano's fails at it is attempting to be green. Glasses of water served with straws. Straws should not be provided automatically. Takeaway containers provided with plastic bags. For the love of God, let people ASK for straws and plastic bags. By 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. We can ALL work together to do our part."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with this place & let me tell you why. Family and I decided to eat here after my niece's first recital, were seated right away & our server introduced himself & got our orders going. Everything was going well.. until our server brought out our cups of water and accidentally knocked them over & wet us.. and I'm not talking just one cup.. must've been a couple or more. My dad got his entire pants wet and so did my boyfriend, water somehow got inside my purse and wet all the contents in it, the floor underneath our table had puddles of water. It was very much a mess and the look of horror on this poor boy's face as he apologized over and over again while running back and forth to grab napkins. Family & I were more shocked at what actually just happened more than we were upset. But we understood, accidents happen. Not only did our server offer to pay out of pocket for appetizers or pay half our bill(we declined by the way, did not want him spending his own money), he told on himself to his manager who then came over to our table & also apologized. In the end, they compensated one free appetizer & charged us half the price of our entire bill which came out to be less than $20. They really did not have to do all that, but for them to, it shows a great deal of how much they value their customers and their name. Although it wasn't the 'perfect' dining experience, we were pleased with the service we received."}
{"text":"Never ever go to Oregano's when you're on a diet.  Everything there is everything that is rich but tasty.  Always tried to talk the co-workers into heading here if I could pull it off since Tempe is off the beaten path for those of us in Ahwatukee.  

The cheese bread is addictive and huge.  If there's any room left, go for the Italian Wedding Soup if it's in season.  I'd go back just for that soup.  The broth is flavorful and it has a huge wonderful meatball in it with a dash of tomato sauce.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the pizza list.  We've only tried the thin crust but everything on the menu was top notch in terms of ingredients and flavor.  No complaints at all.  The service is friendly and the ambience of this place is casual  but lively and fun, too.  If you're going at lunch time, be prepared to wait.  It gets pretty crowded."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! We ordered 3 sides and it was plenty of food for my husband and I. It's a very nice atmosphere and its family friendly. We came for a date night but you can definitely come with kids. I got the old fashioned sangria and it is delicious. We got fried Calamari, the stuffed mushroom, fried zucchini, and Mac and cheese. We loved them all!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is as good as it gets!  Awesome food and service with a very friendly and competent wait staff. Can't wait t go back!!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see that this place has nothing other than 5 stars. My favorite is the big rig pasta with chicken. So good! Order a pizokie for dessert and share! Love love this place!"}
{"text":"I like so many dishes here, cheesy garlic bread, a few different salads, pizza, guaca-tony, etc and don't forget the Bellini! Richard the bartender is the only original employ this location, we have been coming to this location since it opened. Amina and Austin are awesome too. I love the vintage music and tv shows on the tv. Truly a fun place.  The shaker of oregano on the table is perfect and real parmesan cheese!! My go to place!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Used yelp to locate a good pasta pizza place and found oreganos! We shared two pasta dishes recommended by server Kelly, both were fantastic and more than generous portions. The salad was also fantastic, so ook for server Kelly and enjoy your evening meal! Don't forget the pazookie for dessert !"}
{"text":"Really? Who hasn't eaten at Oregano's? 

Consistently yummy--the meatballs are good (better out of the sub though), sandwiches are good, and the salads are delicious!

The Vino Bambino (or something close to that) was super yummy! Chicken, pasta, beans, cilantro, cheese, maters, lettuce, and caesar dressing...Delish!

My sweetie-pie even enjoys the Beefy Beefaroni (or something like that) salad. Definitely has a bit of kick to it, but still enjoyable!

Only issues we had when we went last night was the number of \"enjoy your meals\". Holy crap! EVERY employee we walked by (at least 8-9 by the time we reached our table) told us to enjoy. Now, we're all for being friendly, but the line must be drawn!"}
{"text":"We have tried to come here multiple times  and every time the wait is insane and we decide to go somewhere else. My husband was really craving Alfredo, and it was really early for dinner so we figured we wouldn't have an issue with having a wait for once, so we went. 
We were seated right away and then promptly greeted by our server Kayla. She had plenty of input for us since it was our first time we have been there. 
My husband did the build your own pasta and got chicken alfredo. I got the chicken parm sandwich and both were delicious. 
Kayla was attentive and also told us about the free refills on my husbands pasta. 
Since it was our first time there, Kayla gave us a free cookie too!! She really made our visit! The food was good, but since we already had a bad \"taste\" in our mouth (because of always having to go somewhere else because of a 45+ minute wait) if we had just had mediocre service, we probably wouldn't have came back. 
The only word of advice I would say would be to allow call ahead seating."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday with my dad and our server started out to be nice but then completely ignored us. our table was in the main way/view of him when he walked to go to the other tables. He said he had a lot of tables and that's he couldn't check I . literally observed him go back and forth like we were invisible.Felt so awkward and weird we just wanted to walk off. He's attitude changed even more when I told him he forgot about checking in with us not asking us about the food or if we wanted any refills etc. I think he's name is Adrian. Big eyes medium light brown hair working the patio. Never going back because of the experience. I seriously hope it wasn't because we were Latino."}
{"text":"Terrific service, efficient staff and always consistent food. Oreganos knows how to run a restuarant!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time in Monday and went back Tuesday night because we couldn't get enough!  Highly recommend going a bit earlier than the normal dinner time or you can expect a bit of a wait but the food is phenomenal and totally worth it. Some of their food takes about an hour to cook which we were warned about but again it doesn't matter when the end result is heaven in your mouth!!! 

We are even more excited for the Goodyear location to open!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here more than a couple of times, actually we were making it a Friday must for a while. Food is always good, from sandwiches to Lasagna. Wait on a Friday after 5pm is at the least an hour. Only complaint is that recently there has been a lot of new waiters/waitress's that aren't  as knowledgeable about the menu as we are...not a good sign!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't freaking love this place. Love getting the to go. Cost  effective and always bomb.com"}
{"text":"Love this place! All of the food is good but some of my favorites are the gold wings and bollo pasta and of course pizooki  (sure I'm spelling it wrong!). Service is always excellent. The only thing I've had that I wasn't a fan of was a sandwich because I didn't like the bread. Kid friendly too, they give kids a ball of dough to play with. The atmosphere is sort of loud and fun."}
{"text":"This Oregano's location is always busy, so be prepared for a wait of 30-60 minutes.

I've been here 7 or 8 times for dinner over the past year. The food is always delicious, and the portions are enormous. If you're looking for good pasta/pizza at a reasonable price, this is the place to go. The Bollo Pasta and Alfredo the Dark are two of my favorites. If you want pizza, go with the Deep Dish -- very rich and flavorful.

I'll be visiting this location many more times during the upcoming year."}
{"text":"Not the best restaurant in the world. And really not the very best food in the world. Very loud with zero chance of any intimacy. Tables are way to close together, such that one finds themselves part of or in the middle of conversation at next table. Family oriented. They make no effort to keep families with loud children separated from adult tables. However, my biggest complaint is the absolutely filthy bathrooms. I am a great believer that you should not be able to see the dirty dishes stacked up in the wash area which is very obviously also. Just no kind of ambience for an Italian restaurant. When I return? I think not, for there are much better choices in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Oregano's is probably my favorite restaurant in Arizona so far! I love that they serve Chicago style pizza!

The restaurant is very unique and it makes for a very neat place to dine at even though it can be hard to get a table at times and parking is always somewhat of a challenge. The pizza is excellent and when I go with my fiance we also always get their pizza cookie for dessert, which is so good! The service here has also been top notch when we have visited, so I am very pleased about that!"}
{"text":"Bellini is crave worthy on a regular basis. I'm from Chicago and am a pizza pro.... Love the pan and thin crust. Chicken wings are pretty great too."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's.  The food is awesome.  But sometimes the locations are a little \"iffy.\"

With that, I give my review of my favorite location, Gilbert.  I've been to the ones in Chandler, both Scottsdale locations, Tempe...but by far Gilbert is my favorite locale.

Started off with Calamari. I love that Oregano's has their calamari cut into french fry style wedges, and not the rings and tentacles that most places have.  The dipping marinara sauce needs a little work though.

Then went on to order the Vino Bambino split 4 ways for a dinner salad. To think that this was once taken off the menu? Seriously?  It's so good, once it hits the lips.  

Split a Big Rig and a 'The Lady Is a Scampi.' The size of the shrimp on the LIAS were unbelievable! Could have swore they put Lobster in the dish instead of shrimp.  

Didn't have room for dessert, and I don't really indulge on sweets as it is (I have a rep and a girlish figure to protect), but I hear rave reviews about them. 

All in all, good eats in a great atmosphere, with a very friendly and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"As a family with young kids we can't chance waiting for a table at restaurants so, like usual, we headed out for a late lunch/early dinner with the senior citizens. We usually go to the downtown Gilbert location but since we are wild and crazy (obviously, we eat dinner at 3pm, you can't get much cooler than that) we figured we'd switch it up today. 

The service was excellent. Our waitress was busy but extremely attentive. Another waitress stopped by just to admire our kids. 

Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the food as much as usual. I had the zany ziti and the noodles were so undercooked they were chewy. The bruschetta appetizer was good but I like the guaca-Tony the best- highly recommend! The server gave my daughter an obscene amount of Parmesan cheese so that's a plus in her book! 

Oh and the ice cream pizza cookie...to die for. Seriously, if you go to oreganos and don't get it then you're missing out! If you sign up for their emails you get a free ice cream pizza cookie! Is it your birthday month? Free ice cream pizza cookie!"}
{"text":"Our go to place in downtown Gilbert. Fun atmosphere, great food and always phenomenal service. My favorite is the Alfredo the dark and the Pablo Picasso salad. So good. We usually get the garlic cheese bread as an appetizer while we wait; the holy guacatony is also really good - the bread that's served with it is the best. The thin crust pizza is really good & we are hard to please when it comes to pizza. My daughter loves the deep dish cookie with ice cream! Three of us usually share it and it's plenty big."}
{"text":"I realize it's beginning of June but the place was hot as hell...  it was 117 degrees outside and windows were open and had to be 85 degrees inside the restaurant.  When asked if A/C could be turned on, was given it was on and have to deal.  We were sitting under a vent and absolutely no air coming out for the 90 minutes we sat at the table waiting... it was literally too hot to eat your meal because it felt gross.  It was at least 10 degrees cooler in the bathroom!

Waitress had an attitude and was not pleasant.  And seemed inconvenienced each time we asked for something."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed with my service today. Tables that had more people and that got sat after me got served their food BEFORE me. I have seen pizzas that were ordered after my salad get served before.   I'm pretty sure it takes longer to make a pizza than a salad. The table next to me ordered pasta dishes, are their food, and got their check and left before I even received my food. Extremely disappointed and I won't be back for a long time."}
{"text":"First impressions of a business are EXTREMELY important! The entrance was filthy.  The plant in the broken pot was dead.  I almost turned around and said I don't think I want to eat here, but my friend was already seated.  I have had better salads for sure.  I know pizza is good.  If I were the owner I would tell your manager to clean up the place!! It's really appalling how dirty it was!!!"}
{"text":"Oregano's in Goodyear would have received a 5 star rating had an incident not happened. While attending a birthday party for our granddaughter,we mentioned to the server that it was H.......'s..birthday. They brought out a birthday desert. She shared her treat with her sister and her sister with a shocked look on her face pulled out a STICK PIN from her inside cheek. We were shocked too. Her grandmother went to the manager and showed him what was in the ice creme portion.\" We're sorry\", is all the manager would say. He never came back to check on her or apologize . Nobody at the restaurant was concerned if she needed treatment, etc.... We found out later that they prepared the desert below a bulletin board with stick pins in it. My daughter who has worked at the Phoenician and other upscale restaurants was really bothered that nobody came back to check on her. Accidents happen, but poor managerial skills are not and should not be accepted as the norm in Oregano's."}
{"text":"The food was great! They even gave us a free deep dish because they accidentally made it instead of our thin crust. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Marcus was our server and he was  GREAT! Our service w a great and most of our food was good we had 1 pizza that was cold but they took care of that.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Wait time was ridiculous but expected. Poor service. My sister found hair in her calamari and servers tried to get out of comping my mom for it. Rarely saw server, which lead to rarely getting refills and having to ask other servers for help. Manager was nice enough to come and fix the mistakes but definitely wouldn't suggest going to this location."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Everyone is friendly 
Atmosphere is cool.
Man, them wings and big beef sandwich are amazing
Always a pleasure to come to Oreganos"}
{"text":"I will never forget my first trip to Oregano's - my boyfriend and I had met up with some friends for dinner that night at another restaurant, and the dessert options at that particular place weren't very impressive so we decided to pass. Then my boyfriend told me about the amazing pizza cookie offered at Oregano's, so we got the idea to stop in just for dessert - and we were not disappointed!

When we first arrived we briefly thought they might tell us no they couldn't serve us only dessert, or at least think it was weird or something. But our waiter was so friendly and he absolutely loved the idea! And even though our bill was much smaller than the average customer he was still very happy to serve us, so we made sure to leave him a very nice tip to make up for it. :)

Not too long after that we made another trip to Oregano's, this time for a full dinner. It was much more crowded this time around and the hostess said it would be around 30-40 minutes for a table, so we just decided to sit at the bar. This worked out in our favor because lo and behold, the bartender that night was the same fantastic waiter we had before! So of course like the first time, he was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and provided us with excellent service - I really wish I could remember his name so I could specifically mention him, but unfortunately I don't recall.

My boyfriend and I were torn between appetizers, either the spinach artichoke dip or the fried calamari. Our waiter recommended the fried calamari as the best, and it certainly did not disappoint. For entrees my boyfriend ordered the El Diablo shrimp pasta, which he loved, but I was indecisive between pasta dishes. The mac & cheese with alfredo sauce with two different cheese and chipotle pesto sounded amazing, but on the menu it was only as a side - then in comes our superhero waiter/bartender offering to make it an entree-sized portion for me! And of course, we just had to order cookie pizzas for dessert.

This place far exceeded my expectations, between the delicious food and fabulous service, and we will certainly be back - hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I keep on doing this must be insane trying the same thing over and over again expecting a different result left the dealership helping my buddy by a car starving after being there for 8 hours this is pretty much the only thing open about 9:30 order the salad which their salads are always good thin crust pizza BBQ chicken what is okay like the sauce no flavor the crust no flavor in the cheese which mozzarella doesn't have much but this had none not real crispy which thin crust like this should be since its Chicago style I used to like their hot wings but not sure if they change them or did something they didn't taste very good either and mind you I have not ate in that least 10 hours I was starving and still was not that good maybe I'll learn my lesson this time no more pizza I'll just get the salads"}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions, very well priced. The wait can be really long but just don't go at those times expecting to sit down right away and you will enjoy it. Staff has always been friendly and nice. Same thing at the one in Flagstaff."}
{"text":"I gained 30 pounds here and spent the last two years taking it off. Worth it. Addictive pizzookie and the best pizza in Arizona."}
{"text":"SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE!
Let me start by saying this review is strictly based off our service. It was a Sunday night, my wife and I came in and sat at the bar. Our bartender Anna was absolutely terrible. Idk if it was because we came in more towards the closing hours or not but she definitely did not make us feel welcome. She was very brief when she spoke to us, looked like she was mad about something (us being there around 9:30?), and could never even get a smile out of her. We ordered a guac of Tony and ended up paying and leaving. she never asked us if we wanted a box, and overall we were extremely disappointed. Not only that, but we couldn't even enjoy our meal because there were a bunch of other employees sitting at the table behind us being extremely loud with their conversation! Completely unprofessional! Manager was nowhere to be found otherwise we may of stepped him aside to talk to us about the situation. May try again but next time we will definitely stay far away from that bartender!"}
{"text":"Went here with 2 coworkers for lunch on a Friday afternoon, man what a waste of time. I came from California to eat this? Staff were EXTREMELY friendly (almost over the top), but the service was absolutely terrible. We didn't order any of the complicated and long preparation time items and it took nearly 35 minutes to get our food -- and the restaurant was barely 70% full. 

I got the baked pesto ziti with chicken. It was all right, nothing to write home about. Would be great for pesto lovers as its drenched in it. The redeeming factor was that the grilled chicken addon gives you A LOT of chicken breast for your 3 bucks. The bread bowl was also a little disconcerting

They forgot to input my coworkers order (slice of pepperoni pizza) into the computer and it took an extra 10 minutes after the rest of us got our food to prepare that. Seriously? 10 minutes for 1 slice of the most common pizza ever served?! Other coworker got the Big Rig Rigatoni and she said it was pretty good. Definitely looked better than my dish.

Overall this reminded me of the typical American chain-ish restaurant with the HUGE portions. Staff were superfriendly but that doesn't make up for a disorganized kitchen"}
{"text":"JUST had the worst pizza I've ever had at oreganos, the numero uno was a sloppy soggy mess, had them remake it to go and it was still a soggy crust that was horrible, not even close to what we used to get, will never ever go waste money at this location again, now I will drive to the camelback location if I ever want oreganos again, should have returned the numero uno for a refund but tried to reheat the soggy mess and when I pulled apart the pieces to reheat a hair was under the cheese but above the crust, so nasty NEVER AGAIN EVER!!!! What a waste of $26"}
{"text":"Awesome service, friendly waiters and the vibe was very retro/ old fashioned 50's feel. I enjoyed the old shows they put on their TVs and all the awesome decorations to make you feel you're in another timeline. Highly recommend the pizza!! Deep dish :)"}
{"text":"My favorite place ever!!!! Always very friendly service and a welcoming atmosphere. They hand out pizza samples while waiting for a table - nice touch!! The food is amazing. My husband and I love sharing the antipasto salad and an app. And the pizookie is a must!!!!! Thank you oreganos and keep it up!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time on this joint.... Pizza was below average, ordered a dirty martini think I got a glass of sweet vermouth. Calamari was dis colored from old grease.
Service was the only thing worthwhile. If your going to spend 80 bucks on pizza drinks appetizers, go to Pierro's downtown."}
{"text":"I really like the casual cool atmosphere of the Oregano's locations. I know you shouldn't like the wait but here it feels like you're at a backyard bbq. It's like you're just chilling waiting in your Adirondack chair or sitting on the retaining wall with your friends/family. Just a very kick back chill pizza place.  Can't beat the lunch time deals at this Tempe location. The service is quick the pizza always de-lish. Love me some thin crispy pizza & frosty Four Peaks beer. The golden wings are the best wings on the menu. Love these little fried devils. The sauce is perfection it's sweet, tangy, spicey just awesomeness. I'm trying to figure out how I can rationalize eating some for dinner right now & i't's not even noon yet. Mmm mmm good."}
{"text":"We go here for everything. Because we're celebrating a bday, holiday, a Saturday or just hungry because this place no matter the location never fails. The service is always good & the food delish. Can't say enough about the Bellini or the wings. Always hot, crispy skin & juicy. Just great & I'm not even a wing person per say. The pizza is so great. If you're in the mood for crispy thin this is your place. If you want stuffed this is your place. Basically go here & you wont' be sorry."}
{"text":"I love these kind of places! Lots of personality, a large menu (literally!), and great food. I hear they usually have long waits, but our wait didn't seem too bad since some others in the group came earlier. A couple friends and I shared the stuffed 'shrooms which had great big flavor. They are not the normal small mushrooms that have a few things stuffed inside. These are large mushrooms with lots of ground beef (I think?), basil, cheese, and tomatoes. We also shared a large salad... I forgot what it's called, but it had chicken, cilantro, tomatoes, olives, artichoke hearts (I think?), tossed or served with a light caesar dressing. The salad was huge, even for 3 girls, and we had a pretty decent amount leftover. Lastly, we had the pazookie wannabe. The cookie was slightly undercooked, but it made of a nice ooey-gooey sweet dessert! :) 

I was told service is usually not that great at Oregano's, but everything seemed to line up fine that night. Things went well and our server was pretty good! Soo, this place gets an A!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was disappointed eating here. The food was not impressive at all, actually kind of gross. It's an awkward set up inside and the decor is generic as heck. But the waitress was kind and chatty."}
{"text":"I've hit Oregano's a couple of times now, and I think it's fair to say they've earned a 5 star review.

Both times that I've been there, I've gotten the same dish--the Numbero One-O.  Both times, it's been awesome.  (I wish it was easier to eat here alone and not overeat...  Both times I've been, I've been stuffed upon leaving.)

The pizza is excellent.  When I say that, I'm referring to the thin crust pizza.  As a Chicago deep dish fan, I haven't tried that here yet (it's difficult to, as it's hard to get a deep dish pizza for one person).  But the thin crust pizza reminds me a lot of the pizza that my Dad would make for my family growing up.

Also--the drinks here shouldn't be overlooked.  Their bar is nice (and is a cool place to sit).  They have a bunch of nice cocktails and margaritas, etc. on the menu, but ordering a drink off the menu is a good option here as well.

They also have a big patio, if that's your thing.  (I'm not big into the whole patio scene...  Especially in Phoenix where it's hotter than heck at this time of year...)

In any case, when I'm in Phoenix, and I'm craving Pizza, Oregano's has been a real go-to for me.  And I haven't had an experience that was less than stellar yet."}
{"text":"Service is usually decent, although I have had really good and really bad servers. Salads are huge so order appropriately! The garlic bread is just delicious - I don't get the cheese on it or the marinara on the side because they are both extra and frankly, not worth it. The pizza cookie is wonderful - don't forget that you can order two flavors in the same cookie!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that this location stays open later than the Mesa location (probably due to its proximity to ASU).  But it just couldn't top my experience at the location in Mesa.  If you order the Deep Dish Crust Pizza, be careful!  We had no idea it would have SO much cheese.  We thought the cheese would just be in the crust but it was ALL ALONG the bottom of the whole crust.  My body wasn't feeling that and fearing that we would \"pay for it in the morning\", we asked for a flat crust pizza as a replacement.  The manager was really great about accommodating us (thank you!) but unfortunately in all the confusion, the waiter forgot to put in our order for the Pizza Cookie which we ordered as soon as we sat down *sad face*.  We wound up going back to the original location in Mesa the next week and yummed that up!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is always a great place to eat!  I bring everyone here that comes from out of town who hasn't eaten here.  They have fabulous pastas and pizza's, salads etc.  We always look forward to eating their pizza cookies... big cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.  Couldn't ask for anything better.  They have seating outside and inside and you also have the option of eating at the bar which is quicker.  We always ,have great service although some of their pizzas etc take a little longer to cook.  Sometimes when you are with a preschooler it's hard to wait.  We come here every now and then because it's very hard to get seated right away because they are always so packed and don't take reservations.  We live closer to the Tempe location, but sometimes go to the Mesa one because it's a shorter wait."}
{"text":"One of my \"go to\" spots for pizza.  Had a wonderful afternoon with good food and drink with a wonderful friend.  It was quiet because it was Sunday so we had a great opportunity to catch up.  The small ceasar salad was fresh and large enough to share.  The BBQ Chicken pizza was amazing as always."}
{"text":"The pizza here is like what I used to have at Giordano's in Chicago. This is the heir apparent. The cheese is great, the sauce incredible, and a great crust. This was my birthday dinner, and will be for years to come."}
{"text":"Really Good food especially for a chain restaurant. We always have great service here and the portions are very generous. There are always leftovers."}
{"text":"Checked in via No Wait, arrived on time. Told 10 mins, no problem. After 10 mins told 10 mins. After 10 mins, told 10 mins. Well, 35 minutes later, asked if I could pre order a pizza. \"Friendly\" hostess says only if you are ordering stuffed. Ok, thought I would ask since your sign reads pre order stuff or pan. Well, yea, but we are just now wiping down your table. Ok fine. Still waiting right now. Could have ordered the pizza, but no, in 10 minutes. Update: the waiter is awesome! And still good food."}
{"text":"Good food. Terrible service. Managers are even worse... I recommend just getting the food to go and not even bothering with the service."}
{"text":"We walked in right at Noon on Halloween.... Waitress was dressed as a hippy...interesting to say the least.  Food was very good... HUGE HUGE HUGE portions!  Even the half salad was HUGE!"}
{"text":"Fan of Oregano's but will not hurry back to this location. Server gave poor service compared to the service she gave the other tables in the section. Fries were a bit over cooked, pasta had minimal sauce. 

Appetizer was amazing. (Props to the kitchen on that)
Seating was quick for a Saturday"}
{"text":"Oregano's never fails, exceptional staff and great food. Used the yelp wait list option and it worked very well."}
{"text":"So far so good..
I love pizza.
This place is the best... better Italian Food than Olive Garden. 
Our first time here and now will be a regular place to eat at on special occasions. 
The food was priced right and good."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Drumroll.... I am back on the Oregano's bandwagon!! I had a not-so-hot experience a couple months ago that I included in a review update on Yelp. After posting my review, their PR representative promptly reached out to me, apologized and asked us to give Oregano's another shot. She asked for my contact info to send a gift card -- what great, Yelpy etiquette! And when we came back in it was great to be back. The service and food were amazing and I remembered why I became such a huge Oregano's addict in the first place, (mouthwatering food and fun atmosphere).

You know what they say about customers who have an issue: if you show you care and try to make it right they'll be your most satisfied, loyal customers ever in the future. Having said that, Oregano's and I are officially back together. And to quote Peaches and Herb (yup, that's a real band name), we're \"reunited and it feels so good,\" but mostly, tastes SO good. Thanks, Oregano's!!"}
{"text":"I love Oreganos, but I also love gorgonzola. The two of you were good together, and then last night my BFF and I found out you left Gorgonzola to go back to your \"roots\". That means no Gorgonzola vinaigrette... it also meant no Gorgonzola on the salad. Actually the fancy mixed green salad was ditched for its predecessor, the old style salad.

So the menu prices keep going up, but the food quality investment is going down. I understand how supply and demand works, but it shouldn't work that way for a \"mom and pop\" shop.

I am a salad lover, I want to start my meal the right way. Then last night I was offered balsamic dressing which actually translated to olive oil and balsamic reduction for my circa 1999 old style salad. 

If you want to keep the regulars who helped you build your roots, please stop raising your prices and changing the menu. Committing to a 20 minute wait on a weekday starts to seem silly when your favorite menu items go missing (hahem ... peanut butter pizzuci)."}
{"text":"If its italian night it's Oreganos hands down. I've been to this location 3 or 4 times now and have always left uncomfortably full but very satisfied. Last night we went and started with the Toasted Ravioli's. It's a must get app. The jalapeno cheese inside is perfect.

Then we had the big rig with meatballs and the chicken artichoke lasagne. The big rig still stands as my favorite pasta dish (I like it best with chicken for the health factor, although the meatballs are great). The chicken lasagne is absolutely phenomenal - so much flavor, cheese and chicken. If it wasn't a heart attack I could have it once a week. 

We splurged and finished with the pizzokie...big yummy soft choc chip/white chocolate macadamia cookie covered in ice cream. One of my favorite desserts ever. 

I wish Oreganos existed in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"Oh be still my heart! I do love me some oreganos. Sadly, not my favorite location but only because I'm head over heels for the Dobson and 60 patio (I like what I like, okay?!) I've always had quick, pleasant, and accurate service (except maybe one time but I'm giving the guy the benefit of he was just a tad awkward?) at this location and they always get our to go's right as well! 

And HAPPIEST OF DAYS the original veggie wedgie is back!!! I was devastated when they took it off the menu a few years ago and I wasn't pleased with the attempt at a replacement. But it has returned and I actually did a happy dance when I saw it's back! Add the sweet potato fries (they have a kick, just a warning) and the aioli and it's a veggie lovers dream. 

A few other things you haven't lived until you've tried: Picasso salad, deep dish número one-o, guacatony, and the pizza cookie! 

Go. Eat! And don't even think about calorie counting."}
{"text":"I have only one thing to contribute to the discussion on this Oregano's: THE VEGGIE WEDGIE SANDWICH IS THE BEST VEGGIE SANDWICH EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRR.  Fried veggies + goat cheese + focacia + dipping sauce + waffle fries = heaven.

My favorite method for eating at Oregano's is to either go really early, or call in an order for the V.W. and lounge around feeling fat and happy while watching trashy television."}
{"text":"Great place. Our waiter was awesome and fix two problems we had right away and it was closing hours and he was still so accommodating. 4stars only because one of the tables was dirty and there was food and something sticky on the floor."}
{"text":"We came excellent for a birthday lunch for my sister in law.  Excellent food.. Kelley at the bar was an excellent bartender."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! Love their food, service, ambiance and location. Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for their infamous long wait time to be seated.

Oregano's....if you're listening, please take reservations or call ahead seating!!

There isn't anything on the menu that doesn't come out hot, fresh and delish! I'm hooked on their huge antipasto salad enough for 6 people. Fresh lettuce, lots of Italian meats, roasted peppers, onions, cheese, tomatoes and artichokes. Dressing is amazing! Pair it with garlic bread and it could be a meal.

Pizza....OMG. Thin crust, stuffed, plain or dressed with your favorite toppings...they are all winners.

Lasagna, to die for! Order of huge meatballs with marinara and cheese...can't be compared. Guacatoni....out if this world. Pasta....keep it coming. Wings, award winning! Garlic bread...will keep the vampires away!

Need I say more :)

Oh yes, I will say one more thing. If you leave with out ordering a chocolate chip pizza cookie for dessert, then you've missed out on the whole Oregano's experience. Order one with 4 spoons and everyone can get a piece of the pie...uhum, cookie!"}
{"text":"Surprised to find this place packed at 3pm on a Sunday.
We ordered A stuffed Italian sandwich and a thin crust pepperoni pizza. Sandwich was outstanding. Crusty French bread with loads of meat and veggies. Came with chips and Cole slaw. Took a while for the pizza to come out, but was hot and tasty when it finally arrived. Server apologized for the wait. Friendly service. We will be back."}
{"text":"We  Oreganos and come every time we are in AZ. I like this location better than the one by ASU because of the space and the service. Food is great at both locations. Try the BOOBS dip! Omg we have had quite a few thing ls on the menu and everything had been great. Pizza and pasta are always great choices Big rig, lady is a scampi, Alfredo the dark are fav pastas.  Hubby and son like the Clark St pizza. We tried the Grandama g's and it was good but the rosemary was a little overpowering."}
{"text":"Two stars for the beverages. The food was gross. Way to salty. Long 
wait for bad food. Tried to get in there 3 times now. What a disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"Great location close to Harkins. My wife loves the Pablo Picasso salad which is amazing and so freakin huge! They're wings of fire chicken wings are great I always get them medium. Also the pizza is very good. It can be very busy so I suggest call ahead or wait for deliciousness lol"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Great, fun ambiance!!  The dessert is a MUST!  Can't go wrong with whatever you order.  We also love the Guacatony app!"}
{"text":"Initially, the atmosphere brings you in.
The theme of the restaurant is overused ( 1930
s-1940's decor with old magazine covers,fake reproductions and retro decor.
The temperature inside the dining area was cold, with no fireplace or heater and the windows open.  So,that being said I was uncomfortable from the start.( It was 50 degrees outside which is cold for us zonies.
The hostess and waitress were excellent, and very cordial,unfortunately for them the food was sub par and gave me an atrocious 2 day case of either indigestion or e-coli poisoning ( I'm not sure which)  .
I ordered their house \"Oreganos \" salad with added chicken.  The temperature was too warm for a salad and the chicken was cold ( should have been opposite) , perhaps that is where  the problem started?
Next, we were brought out a small deep dish pizza with sausage that was runny and not what I would expect for a 16 dollar pizza.  Disappointed and not tasty at all.
The next entree was a 16 inch thin crust that was better, but the crust was limp and not crispy like a hand made thin should be.   Again way too much money for the low quality.
My child had a small caesar salad and she also developed indigestion, but perhaps that was just coincidental.
In their defense , it was relatively busy, but not THAT busy,so either the cook needs some more lessons or they were just sloppy on this particular evening ( Sunday)
I have dined at other Oreganos locations for lunch and it has been a hot or miss.
This trip was overpriced and make me sick at my stomach.
60 dollars...no beer or wine and I had water to drink.....No way..Next time I will be driving by Oreganos to a better tasting place
Pocketdogg"}
{"text":"this is our go to place for thin crust pizza, love their pizza!  Tonight we had a Picasso salad too.  So yummy.  And of course....the pizzookie."}
{"text":"This pizza was so salty and gross. We ordered a thin pepperoni and sausage and a pan broccoli and spinach.  Both pizzas were so salty and uneatable. The pan pizza was burnt on bottom. Sadly it was carryout, so could not easily return. Ended up throwing away and ordering from hotel diner. So disappointed."}
{"text":"This is our second time to an Oregano's. The service we had today was the best service I've ever had and I'm 51 years old. Harrison was a great server and his attention to detail was outstanding. I was able to talk to the manager Aris to give him feedback about Harrison and was very impressed with the managers professionalism. The food was amazing as usual and there was so much food we had to take a bunch home. Well done Oregano's. We will be back soon. After we finish our leftovers. Lol"}
{"text":"We were there to celebrate a birthday. The food server was very service oriented. That was the only good thing about our experience. After 45 minutes, waiting for our meal the food server told us it would be up in a couple minutes. At an hour I asked where our meal was. An hour and 10 minutes after we arrived they finally brought the meal to the table. The bread was soggy from sitting on top of the warm pasta waiting for the rest of the order. We returned one meal to the kitchen. I was 24 hours recovering from whatever wasn't right in my meal. The manager did apologize for the delay in the meal. He told us the kitchen had been filling a catering order.  He offered to buy us dessert. Our birthday celebration had gone from a fun event to a disaster. He was offering use dessert, which cost him nothing. The right answer would have been to give us the meal for free to make up for the pathetic experience. You lost us as repeat customers"}
{"text":"Pizzza is great and so are there golden wings. This place has been great for 20 years and just keeps doing it never a bad meal here. Great service also and desserts. Dine in or take out both great"}
{"text":"Started off with the stuffed mushrooms. Two huge mushrooms stuffed with sausage topped with sauce, cheese and chopped tomatoes. I like to put a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes in them to spice them up. I had the eggplant parmigiana which was ok, not the best I have had and not the worst.  My husband had the Bowl-O- pasta which was good. And he also ordered a side of sausage."}
{"text":"Been here way too many times to keep count.  By far our favorite 'go to' place.  Great huge salads at a great price.  The pablo picasso is a meal in itself.  The pizza is awesome, the quacatony is outstanding, and on and on.  Nothing negative to say about this place from the staff to the salad to the pizza cookie!"}
{"text":"man it's been years since I've been to Oregano's I remember the pizza being some of the best around well they have changed or my tastes have changed because pizza was not very good dough taste like flour no flavor at all sauce Bland very disappointed in the pizza now the salad was very good and huge for the price I guess that's why everyone I know that goes Oregano's always talks about the salads makes sense to me now our server was very nice was on top of everything without her I would have gave it to you star salad and service is great pizza and not so much go back for salad but not the pizza"}
{"text":"While vacationing in AZ we came here for dinner with family. They told us it was a busy restaurant, with a party of 7 we waited about 45 minutes and it was totally worth the wait. I tried the El Diablo Shrimp Pasta, the waiter and manager both joked that they'd bring me the fire extinguisher. I like spicy and loved this dish. Seeing as how it was our first time we all tried a bite or two of each others dishes and found everything tasted good. The service for the busy dinner was smooth. Can't wait to make a return visit on our next trip!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Every time we've ever tried to come here, the wait has been too long! We were finally able to come at lunch time to get in sooner. Excellent food, excellent service!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just a bad night. The Chicago deep dish cheese was really watery.  Kind of gross.  The staff is always very friendly and it seems like at least ten people say hello when you walk in.  Too bad the food was really subpar this time."}
{"text":"If there isn't a crowd to drown out the horribly annoying music, stay away! Good salads and great pizza ( and pizza cookie). It's a treat for our family to go there but a sacrifice for my husband and I because of the obnoxious five songs they play over and over. Oye!"}
{"text":"Came here for a salad after a hike up camelback. We shared the House salad with chicken and Italian dressing. The big salad is definitely enough for two people. It was sooo good!! The chicken is sliced thin and is cooked with spices that make it taste amazing! Everything was fresh, and tasty. Although we ordered the Guaca-Tony, we were not able to get it because they ran out. The delivery food truck was running late. The owner made it alright by giving us a gift card to come back. I wasn't mad, and he definitely didn't have to do that. Some things are out of our control. But I appreciate the wonderful customer service. Thank you. I will definitely be back! I highly recommend this place! I wish I had it back home!"}
{"text":"A local favorite. Friendly staff, solid food at a great price. My top two go to's are the Big Beefstro Salad and Big Rig pasta with chicken. The beefstro is enormous with a kick and piled with shaved beef. The cream sauce in the big rig is outstanding, and the shaved chicken just works. Other favorites of mine are the garlic chicken lasagne and toasted ravioli. 
A MUST is the pizzoki dessert. Try it 1/2 chocolate chip and 1/2 white chocolate. It's incredible."}
{"text":"My belly smiles when thinking of Oregano's 

I used to go here all the time when I lived in Tempe but then I moved away and ever since then, I've been craving it, go figure. 

So when I was out on Easter morning in Charlotte and saw a chick wearing an Oregano's shirt, I knew I had to have it on my next trip to AZ. 

Game on! 

I love this location mostly in part due to the proximity of campus and their outdoor patio. We stopped in for lunch last week and they promptly seated us and right in front of a fan to cool us off. I was praying that I put on my deodorant and smelled ok because I didn't want my so-called-stink to be flying all over the patio area. 

Service was fantastic-most of the server seem to be students and are so enthusiastic, you would kind of want to slap them if they weren't so nice. 

I never knew they had lunch specials such as pizza slices, pasta and salad so I went with a slice of pizza but before that there was thing I had to have, 

Boom Dip. 

It's a spinach and artichoke dip so delicious and cheesy they if I try really hard, I can taste it. They changed up the bread they serve with it and it used to have a kick of spice to it but this time it didnt. No worries because I was going to wipe that bad boy out. 

If only I could get it overnight delivered, sigh."}
{"text":"Food is always perfect and the staff is great almost 100% of the time. There's occasionally a server who doesn't pay much attention but all the rest are fantastic!!! Literally all the food is good. You can't go wrong. Music can sometimes be a little annoying. But other then that it's pretty great."}
{"text":"From Chicago and this place has it right.  Great thin crust pizza, great salads (Pablo!), and good apps. Definitely my favorite in the area."}
{"text":"This could totally be a biased review because I've only been one time and tried one thing - the stuffed pizza!  Which to me is more like a huge hot pocket or some sort of Italian casserole with crust.  Wasn't a fan at all!  I do tend to give the place another shot because it was PACKED that Friday night I picked up my unsatisfying stuffed pizza!  Oh and it was expensive!  I remember that!"}
{"text":"=( i used to live in chandler and i recently moved to chicago. I can honestly say that there is nothing like oreganos out here Unfortunatly I soooo cant wait to come back home to go have dinner at oreganos. ITs so sad can you guys open up in chicago???"}
{"text":"Great food ,great atmosphere , this place is great for dates especially when your high af with your girl on her birthday"}
{"text":"Our food was amazing! Cameron was our server and was so polite and prompt, he did a great job! I suggest the bruschetta and chicken parm. YUM!"}
{"text":"I love Oreganos and it was my nieces first time here, she liked it (and she's pretty picky about food so that's a plus)! Coming in early was nice because there was no wait and there always is a wait. I love the spicy pastas thy have here and recommend it without a doubt."}
{"text":"Good things are worth waiting for and I mean GOOD! I have never had such good pizza in my life and I'm 70 years old. Deep dish mushroom and sausage was definitely 5 star. The wait time was like the old pizza places where they make everything fresh but after one taste we forgot about the wait. We visited the Oreganos in Flagstaff, Az and the decor was great too. Please, send us Oregano's to the Central Valley (Modesto in particular) of California!!! I promise you lots of business!"}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust pizza. Always have gotten great service here. I love the giant soda/water cups they have, you don't need wait for refills all the time. And definitely save room for a pizza cookie."}
{"text":"Omygoodness!!  The cheesy garlic bread is to DIE for.  Their specialty here is thin crust pizza but I was really in the mood for deep dish and Oregano's did NOT disappoint.  We'll be coming back again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Folks if you're reading this, come only if you're super hungry as the portions are HUGE. Came here today for a Sunday lunch and wasn't prepared for how big these portions were going to be. Place wasn't slammed for lunch as it was after 2PM but there were about a dozen diners eating and only one waitress in our area.

Started with a Kale Caesar salad which was very generous in servings. We didn't add the chicken to the salad as we had big pasta dishes coming. The salad was amazing, it was HEARTY, meaning that not only was enough for two people but we had enough to take home for a second helping. The salad was coated nicely with a very light caesar dressing and the kale wasn't crispy nor soggy, it was just right. There was a nice amount of parmesan shavings on it, raisins sprinkled throughout and also tiny circular pieces of friend mozzarella cheese. The whole thing just worked. Absolutely delicious.

After 15 minutes the main entrees came and boy was it large. I already knew that we would be taking a doggie bag as the servings seemed like twice what you would get at an Olive Garden. My hubby ordered Chicken Parmesan and for me the Chicken Garlic Lasagna. My hubby's order came out piping hot and for some reason my lasagna came out lukewarm and the cheese toast cold. That right there was s strike as I have a thing about food being served hot.

So since my lasagna didn't come out steaming hot like my husband's food, I lost interest in eating it. Rather then sending it back, I forked a couple bites and then just wrapped it to go hoping that it would taste good for another meal. As far as my husband's meal he really liked his chicken parmesan dish. I took a bite of his food to get a taste but after one small bite I felt it was too salty.

The experience overall with food quantity was good and service was ok, I believe we'll come back another time to try the pizzas and the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  We ordered the thin crust pizza.  A lot of cheese and toppings.  The server did great.  Our glasses never ran dry."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch on a Saturday and sat at the outside bar. We were greeted by the bartender shortly after sitting down, and he took our drink order. He brought us back some menus and our drinks very quickly, and said he would give us a couple minutes to decide what to eat. He then disappeared on us, although other people at the inside bar were still being served. We pretty much finished our drinks with no one to take a food order or to check on us. We took this as a bad sign for the service we would be receiving, and just had our 2 drinks before leaving for food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Currently sitting on the patio. I have had to ask for whatever i needed.  Very poor service.  There were 3 servers then there were none. The food was mediocre at best and not a good value"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, good quick service. I still think you should consider a gluten free pizza even though I've read why. But happy with service at this location"}
{"text":"Napoleon D. sez, \"pretty much my favorite pizza.\"  The thin crust pie is awesome (I avoid deep dish or thick crust, too much dough). Their salads are huge, the smallest feeds 3. The servers are terrific at all locations. I think I've been to 6 so far. Friendly, fun and on the ball. Try the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. Shrooms on steroids, stuffed with sausage and marijuana sauce is the best way to describe them. Spectacular!!!  
Just a side note, I went there for lunch a few years ago and had a slice. No good. Dried out and over done. Order a fresh pie made to order and you won't be disappointed.
Go there, pig out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Common eat spot for my work peeps. People literally fly in for the Big Rigg! I somehow always order and pay for a cookie, but never see it, though. Suppose it's just some sort of karmic \"fat tax\""}
{"text":"I'm not exactly a fan of thin crust, but I gotta admit, Oreganos crust is pretty tasty... this coming from a pan/deep dish loving girl! It's probably because of their inventive toppings. My favorite is the El Picasso... Crisp tortilla chip topped pizza? I AM THERE!

I also like to eat there wing and salad style, split with a friend: Mrs. G's Spinach Salad and Italian Gold Wings, the latter is thanks to a friend and fellow wing-lover of mine who moved away. As it is made with mustard--I hate mustard--I would've never thought to order it, but she told me they were her fave and we had a wing night and I agreed! I've even made a noodle dish with the sauce--it is THAT good! My fave prior were the Wong's Wings, but alas, they have since deleted it off their menu. I can heartily say, even if they were still on the menu, the Italian Golds still win the Gold!

Another thing I miss off their menu are the waffle fries. They recently changed their fry option to Bistro sweet po's... but couldn't they have both? I know Sweet potatoes are better for you, but I LOVED the crispness of their waffle fries paired with an order of wings to share. Now I have to go to Ticoz for the Crisp Waffle Fry fix--the only alternative is Chick Fil-A... but theirs are mushier.

And as the sweet ending? The Triple Vanilla Scooped Chocolate Chip Pizza Cookie, of course!

I've had other things off the menu through the years... The Frisco, Pesto Pizza, Original Salad with that Raspberry Dressing... but they are just okay.

My only complaint is the wait... when this place gets busy, it gets SO busy--Even for to go orders! I had an experience once where it was a 45 minute wait to eat there and a 1.5 hour wait for a to go order... WHAT?! And even when dining... the wait is pretty long... but I don't notice because I'm usually enjoying the company I'm with... so, if you bring great friends and lots of time, you will be fine!"}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! The only thing that saved this review was that the waitress was really nice and sweet and very attentive. The hostesses however, NEED SOME MAJOR WORK. We were told that it would be a 30 minute wait for a party of 4 which isn't bad for a Friday night but we ended up waiting for over an hour!!!! We went up and complained 3 times just to keep getting told \"oh you're next\". Meanwhile people who got there 5 minutes ago got a table for 2 that sits 4 people! WTF??? Totally annoying but like I said the actual waitress was on point and did a great job!"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza and the salads are great.  I am a New Yorker by birth and am difficult to please when it comes to pizza; am not a thick crust fan.  Pizza was delicious.  My friend had the salad with beef and it was a meal in itself.  As a matter of fact he told me sometimes he just has the salad.  The service was good. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have NEVER been to a restaurant where every single person who crossed my way has greeted me and was super sweet! This place is amazing. From the wonderful and  flavorful food to Mechelle our server. Mechelle you are great and thank you so much for your patience in us while we asked you so many questions about the menu. I'm from LA came to visit AZ and I've had my fair share of Italian food but Oreganos totally takes the prize.  When we arrived the place was packed... The wait for 2 was about 25-30 min .. But we sat at the bar and totally hit it off with Mechelle! I got the Big Rig with chicken and sausage and my friend got chicken bake with sausage. Both had a great hint of spice but the flavors made the food addicting- portions were huge and we ended up boxing it up and enjoying it all later. New favorite spot!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to different Oregano's a few times. I was excited when this location opened a few years ago because it is close to where I live. They have grown on me. When I first heard about them I knew everyone raved about how good they were. I check out the menu and was unsure of the southwestern meets Italian cuisine but the more I try it the more I like it. The flavors are great and work really well together. The Big Rig Pasta is my favorite but I also like their pizza. For lunch you can get a huge slice for like $3. Their stuffed pizza is really good but since it is baked it takes awhile. About 45 minutes to an hour but you know it is fresh and it is so worth the wait. Only thing is it isn't too good cold. I love cold left over pizza but this just turns into a big congealed mess. So bring enough people to finish it off or heat it up if you take left overs home.
I took my girlfriend here the other day for lunch. She had never been before. I was nervous because she is a really good Italian cook and therefore has high standards when it comes to Italian food. She was questioning the southwestern/Italian mix like I did. I was hoping she would like it and she did. Whew. She got the Italian grinder which she was glad was called a grinder and had real cappicola ham on it. She also had a few bites of my Big Rig Pasta and liked that as well. Good we can come back and try other things.
We told the waiter that it was her first time there and had never had one of their pizza cookies so he gave us one for free. That was really cool. It was also really good. Nice and soft and warm with really good vanilla ice cream on top. I didn't know they had 3 different kinds but we got the regular chocolate chip.
I will definitely be bringing her back here and tagging along with her."}
{"text":"The Big O Vedge is the best vegetarian sandwich I have ever had.  Like... for real.  It is extremely flavorful.  And...with their friendly servers, this location is my solidified favorite! :)"}
{"text":"Their Alfredo the Dark is probably the best pasta dish in Phx. And then there's the Pazookie..."}
{"text":"This place always seems to be busy but it is pretty good food.  Im big on pizza crust.  I like to believe it could make or break a pie.  Their crust is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"The wait wasn't bad at all. Usually it's an hour, so maybe they are improving! Food was great as usual. The waitress started off really good, but faded the longer we were there. They started getting busy and she has way too many tables. They need to get more staff. Overall far better than my last visit!"}
{"text":"I've been to this new location once mid week at lunch time & was given a 45 minute wait. We walked up & sat at the bar no problem & the wait time was more like 30 vs 45 quoted by hostess desk.
The second time we went was on a Sunday early evening & again quoted a 45 minute wait but lucked out again with 2 seats at the bar. I was kind of hidden on the outside by a window but the service was still great. The wait time though was a 45 minutes this go around. 
So far I can only state the bar service as I haven't yet waited for a table but everything at the bar was aces. The food was great (as usual). Love that we have an Oreganos on the West Side FINALLY!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Oreganos for such a long time I cannot remember the first time I went.  We got the Lawrences original pizza, the italian gold wings and the PIZZA COOKIE!!!!! YUM!!!!  
After that first visit I was hooked!  
The problem is that the restaurant is very small...the set up is cool but they need more space...and that is in anyone that I have gone to...the wait is always super long, but that is because the food is awesome!  
My suggestions are: The Boom Dip-spinach dip and Bistro Sweet Po's (sweet potato fries)
Salads:  Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad and Oreganos Favorite-YUM!!
Wings: Italian Gold (be careful if you have acrylic or gel nails it will dye them yellow so be careful) get them with ranch!!
Pizzas:  BBQ Chicken, Frisco (my favorite with the tomato cream sauce!!) Lawrence original (I like to add chicken to it) and the El Picasso pizza!  The stuffed pizza is awesome too with pepperoni!!!  
Pasta: Pesto Penne Bake (with meatballs or italian sausage) to die for!! The Zany Ziti with the meat added is great!  
Dessert:  THE MOST AMAZING DESSERT EVER!!! the PIZZA COOKIE-i love all flavors but the chocolate chip is the best with vanilla ice cream!  You can eat this for a man by itself!  
Drinks:  I love their Gibbilini Bellini!  
YUM YUM YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday. We ordered a numero uno pizza for the two of us. It took a little over 20 minutes to arrive. It was absolutely smothered in cheese on a wafer thin crust. The toppings slid right off into a gooey greasy mess.

Both my wife and I thought there was potential, but we strongly preferred BJ's to here."}
{"text":"I love the Gilbert location, but since I am an ASU alumni and frequented this place, I have to list the Tempe location as my favorite.

This is basically the same post I left for the Gilbert one, but this place definitely has the more friendly staff. Pizza is pizza is pizza to me - I'm not a pizza afficianado like other people - but this place spoke to my heart. And if you don't come in for the pizza, at least go in for the pizookies, pasta or whatever else your little heart/big appetite desires."}
{"text":"Ummmmm hello! The best customer service ever! I worked for in n out for 4 years and they live up! The white pizza with red onions and garlic sauce was good. The tomatoes were a little much. I will be back to try other options but bc of the friendly staff I will score as high as I did. Management, take note!!"}
{"text":"Order the huge cookie thing that has melted chocolate and ice cream in it. AMAZING! I think it used to be called Pazookie but they don't advertise it now apparently."}
{"text":"Good pizza.   I've been all over the world sampling pizzas and this place makes good pizza. Not awe inspiring pizza like you might find in Italy or great pizza that you might find elsewhere in Europe. Still, it's pretty good pizza.  You have to search hard in Arizona to find better. Please note that you always wait to be seated and after you order, the pizza will take even longer to get your table. Don't worry it will be well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The last review was from our first visit, and I'm going to say maybe the service want good because they had only been open for a few weeks.  Almost a year later and decide to give them another try. This time just the hubby and I, we opted to sit at the bar. Drinks were good and the food was good as well. Did didn't wait nearly as long as before. A much better experience this time around."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a great lunch here today.  We sat outside in the bar area and Lexi was our waiter.  She was attentive and fun.  The manager and staff were all fabulous!  And the food......WOW!  We split an Oreganos special salad and a Bistro Pizza!  The salad was perfect, super cold and not too much dressing and perfect to split.  The pizza was probably one of the best thin crust pizza's I have had!  And for dessert was a cookie pizza with ice cream - enough said!  One if the best meals out that we have had in a long time - including places way more expensive."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this Oregano's thanks to our server, Cory. He was so attentive and just an overall great person. I ordered my go to which is the Stuffed Rigatoni and my boyfriend had a sandwich omg SO MUCH MEAT! It was so good! We ordered a side of their hot wing sauce and it made everything even better! Delicious! To top it all off we finished with the pizza cookie half salted caramel half chocolate chip."}
{"text":"Great food great service...had the ribeye steak salad and hot wings, wasn't that hungry (got the junior salad which was more than enough)...they were both spicy and delish."}
{"text":"This is a chain-franchise-knock-off. It's not good, it's not bad. It has the same value as fast food, but a little nice and therefore you will pay more. It's a place I visited while moving. I chose it because I could see it from the Elliot Street. The service was ok, but the food was far from impressing. I ordered the waitress corporate predetermined recommendation - and it wasn't good. It tasted like anything you can buy in the frozen meals section from the grocery store, prepared well. I will not be coming back.  
.. und das ist was es ist"}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant because I'm in love with the diablo shrimp! I've had it at multiple Oregano's but this location is the best. My server Rhiley was the best and took such great care of me and my friends!! I would come back for her only!"}
{"text":"We arrived early on a Sunday in an attempt to beat the dinner crowd but 4:30 PM was not early enough.  We had a party of 12 so we knew it would be a while, our wait was about an hour which was under the time they quoted us. 

The service was outstanding.  Everyone from the hostess, to the table busser's were kind, quick and professional.  Our server was Andrew and he was the best server I have had the pleasure of having in a long time.  Our glasses were never empty, he cared about each guest taking the time to make sure they liked their food and everything was ok.  He didn't just ask because it was his job and he was told to do it, you really got the impression he cared.  If the wait wasn't so long I would request for Andrew every time I went.  

The food was excellent as expected.  We deep dish pizza, two regular pizza's, meatball sandwich, the Big Rig, and Alfredo in the dark.  For dessert we ordered 4 poozikies, two peanut butter and two chocolate chip, to share between the 12 of us.  

I would recommend Oregano's but be prepared for the wait, you cannot make reservations or call ahead.  Go early and plan to wait but it is worth it!!!  If you can't afford the time to wait order take out!!!"}
{"text":"Get the one heck of a slice and make it your own! Sweet server Kassandra! #staycation"}
{"text":"Since I posted the review I got a call from the manager who was actually interested in what went wrong--under a prior manager. I appreciated the concern and the offer to make up for it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in Phoenix, I've tried about ten different things there and I loved all. Food has always been hot, correct and consistent. I've had sandwiches, pasta, salads, deserts and drinks and never disappointed. The servers have been awesome, and one time at another location one of the busboys came running out to the parking lot with my wallet( I dropped it on the seat when I was leaving, and it had $400 dollars in it!) Who does that? The most honest guy in Arizona, that's who! 
I love Oreganos!"}
{"text":"This review is based entirely on a stuffed Chicago-style pizza that we got to go.  

It was DELICIOUS.  I can honestly say I can't wait to order it again.

When we called, we were given a time an hour and a half later to come pick it up.  This is not the place to go if you are in a hurry.  I'm pretty into the whole Slow Food thing, so I don't mind waiting.  I know that good food takes time.  Hell, Chicago-style pizza should take at least 45 minutes, if it's done right.  If you know it's going to take awhile, it's easy to mentally prepare for it.  Now, if I was absolutely starving and went to this place not knowing about the notorious wait...then I might have a problem.

I liked what I saw when we went to pick it up.. the interior is cozy and fun.  The patio was hoppin', and they have an outdoor bar.  Some guy was going around with little pieces of fresh, hot pizza to tide everyone over.  WARNING:  It may look like cheese but it's not...at least not when we were there.  I am a pretty strict vegetarian but had to laugh when I ate it and discovered there was pepperoni underneath the cheese.  Next time, I'll be sure to ask.  :)"}
{"text":"Came here for their cookie and ice cream dessert! Got to sit outside at their bar and was served pretty quickly. Haven't come here for regular dinner, but can definitely recommend it for their dessert!"}
{"text":"Just got back from the Dobson and Germann location ,got to say some of the best service ever.Warner our server was great and also very pleasant.It was a special night for my wife and I.We were a party of 8 and everyone enjoyed the food and above all the service was fantastic thanks again Warner will be going back and will recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza.  Might get this if I was having a party and needed to feed 20+.  The specialy pizzas are the way to go.  The one with potatoes, onions, and rosemary.  Good pzza, not great.  Good beer inside, not great.  Good service, not great.  

3 stars.  I think that NYPD pizza has a slight edge over them, and they dont come even close to cibo, pizza a metro, or pizzeria bianco."}
{"text":"My first experience at this establishment was good! Waitress and greeter were prompt and friendly. Gluten Free options while limited, offered decent variety. My waitress recommend a pasta dish and sauce which I followed and was not disappointed in. I'd like to see a bit more options for us gluten free folks, but overall I enjoyed the food and overall experience. Next time I'm in town, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this location! Service is ok. Arrive early to avoid the wait! Gluten free pizza is great!"}
{"text":"This is the first Oreganos I visited & my fave only because it was my first one to visit back in 94. The food is great, the staff nice & helpful the parking is still stupid but doable on a Sunday afternoon. Thanks for the years of good food, cold beer & good service."}
{"text":"Simply put - great menu and the staff has great personalities! Definitely make sure you come with an empty belly though, because some of their portions are somewhat epic :)  Definitely recommend it!  I tried a pasta dish and it was amazingly delicious and more than enough for two people. I tried a piece of the pizza too and that was really good too!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorites.  Saw the new place in Goodyear and ate dinner there on January 31st 2016.  They were packed as anticipated but there was room at the bar so we opted for that.  Quality of food and service was as expected.  Never a bad meal yet an any Oregano's we've been to."}
{"text":"Can't remember if I yelped about this place yet, but if I did, I'm sure I already gave it a great review. Pizza is pizza is pizza to me - I'm not a pizza afficianado like other people - but this place spoke to my heart. And if you don't come in for the pizza, at least go in for the pizookies, pasta or whatever else your little heart/big appetite desires."}
{"text":"Oregano's is home to the Great Dessert War of '02. The skirmish began when the then named Bazookie was placed on the dinner table. The Bazookie as describe by the menu is \"a 1/2 pound of Chocolate Chip dough, slightly baked in a 6-inch pizza pan then topped with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream.\" Things started out with the appropriate amount of consideration for the other diner til the first bite was consumed. A fire was noticed in each others eye. Utensils soon became weapons. Ground was won and lost. The battleground was a deep dish pizza pie pan that was spun numerous times in order to gain advantage for the best and perfect bite. Spoon fulls of warm cookie dough were knocked down back onto the table to be taken away... It turned ugly quick. No offers of sharing or giving the last bite. It was fought for tooth and nail. The dessert was THAT GOOD. 

I would go back to Phoenix for this dish alone. And the pizza? It is a pizza joint, but that's not what we talk about or remember. The pizza was good, but not on the level of the dessert. Freshly baked chocolate chip cookie dough and vanilla ice cream!!!! What more do you people need???"}
{"text":"The pizza is alright. My suggestion is do NOT order an appetizer. Every single time that we did it came out the same time as the pizza which kinda defeats the purpose of ordering an appetizer. Run by a bunch of high school kids that never been taught about the dining experience and how to serve properly. I blame management more than the service or kitchen staff.

Don't have the same problem at any other Oregano's locations that I have been to. It is solely this location."}
{"text":"Poorest service ever.  We love the food here but after this experience we will not come back to this location.  It took so long to even take our order.  We have been here over an hour and we just got our food!   Had to ask twice for them to bring dough for our 2 year old to play with.    So irritated!!!"}
{"text":"All the meals my group has eaten here have been great  . They are very friendly here and give you good service. You probably will find many different flavors in the pasta that you will like. The salads are wonderful . Fresh pepper and cheese with the pasta meals .Great food for the price you pay. Cold beer!"}
{"text":"We first went to Oregano's in Tempe.  Magnificent food.  We happened to be running errands near this one and got hungry, so we stopped.

Inside, it looked just like every other Oregano's:  spacious, a little dark, a lot of leg room in the booths, and tables aplenty.  It wasn't busy at all around this time, so we were promptly seated by a friendly host.

Our server was nothing to write home about.  She was nice enough, but we have all been around people who clearly are phony, almost to the point of being farcical in their niceties.  This was our waiter.  Her smile was forced.  Her asking to refill our drinks seemed laborious.  I could have done without her.  I don't like phony.

I ordered their chicken Caesar salad, and my husband ordered two slices of pieces and a salad.  His food looked great.  He said he liked it.  My salad was mediocre.  It was fresh; the chicken was fresh.  But there was nothing that made the taste stand out.  It tasted no better than anything I could have gotten at Denny's.

I'll just stick with the one in Tempe."}
{"text":"First try at Oregano's.  I tried during a prior week but the place was packed and a 45 minute wait.  Less of a wait this Friday so I made it in.

The decor is a super-cluttered, funky look.  Lots of odds and ends, mostly vintage with posters and photographs.   I was most fascinated by an old, wire, box-spring with large Christmas lights looming overhead serving as unconventional lighting.  Whoever came up with this was truly creative!   

Ordered a $14 cheese pizza, thin crust and a side of meatballs with marinara sauce and cheese.   The hallmark of a good italian place is a good meatball and their eggplant parmigiana.  If they make these well (including a good marinara), it's a good place.  

The meatballs came first and they were delicious.  They were not hard, not soft and like in The 3 bears, they were Just Right.  The herb combination was excellent.  Italian restaurants tend to err on too much oregano. They did not.  The marinara was good--not too sweet, not too acidic and not too much oregano.  So I was happy.  

The disappointment came with the thin pizza which took \"thin\" to another level.  It was too thin from my New York Pizza Snob perspective.  Love thin pizza, but not this thin.  It was almost like it was a Pita bread crust, it was that thin.  
The pizza had plenty of cheese so no problem there---our waiter, Jesus, asked if we wanted more cheese on top which we turned down.  

We wanted a dessert such as Tiramisu and was disappointed to find that the only dessert was a pizza sundae of sorts.  I suggested to the waiter that some Italian desserts might be a good idea in an Italian themed restaurant.  He promised to pass the suggestion to \"corporate\".  

Their prices are fair and because of this there were many families with children.... yes... lots of children, lots of noise, lots of children fussing and crying.  So if you don't mind the noise and you like your pizza super thin, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Although the service is somewhat slow, its mainly because its so busy. The atmosphere is awesome, and the pizza always tastes really fresh. 

Be careful. The hot hot wings are very spicy."}
{"text":"Great food...I could eat here everyday! So delicious!! Very friendly restaurant. Kid friendly and nice bar...no watered down drinks...you can taste ur alcohol!!"}
{"text":"I'm an ASU student and I go here every time my parents are in town.  NEVER HAD ONE BAD THING!

The pasta is amazing, the meatball sandwich is awesome, never had a bad appetizer.  The half baked cookie is out of this world.  But the deep dish, OH MY GOD!  The best pizza I have ever had, hands down!  Cuts like piece of pie.  If you're a meat lover, get the deep dish with pepperoni, sausage and meatballs.  it's what my dad and I get and it is just amazing!

All of this added on to a funky place, friendly staff and amazing atmosphere and you have a huge winner!

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype leading up to going to Oregano's... unfortunately it's not a mind blowing experience. It was a run of the mill place with above average food. Not necessarily impressed by anything, but nothing bad to say either."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! The have awesome food and great service. Try the midday rush specials for lunch they have a few super cheap options for the lunch rush!!! If you're a drinker try the BELLINI! Its an amazing frozen cocktail made with red wine, rum, champagne and schnapps! It will knock your socks off in a good way!   


I'm disappointed in the change of recipe for the toasted raviolis! PLEASE change it back to the original recipe it was soooooooo much better. I'm still a sucker for cheese so I will order them as an appetizer anyway but I still prefer the old recipe.

Try the Pablo Picasso Mexican Salad it is to die for! SOOOO amazing with the crunchy tortilla strips and the freshly grilled chicken, it a must try!!! But for all the salads I recommend the Jr. size because the normal size is HUGE and the Jr size is still enough for three people to share!

The Alfredo the dark and the deep dish pizzas are also great!!! 

**** DON'T FORGET TO SAVE ROOM FOR THE PIZZA COOKIE!!! stick with the traditional chocolate chip version, I love peanut butter and macadamia nuts but both don't even come close to the amazingness of the original! Sure to be the best part of your visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent salads! On the other side of the spectrum, their pazookie ( soft baked  cookie with ice cream) is the best in AZ!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time going to Oregano's. We went for my wife's birthday because she has been here multiple times. We expected a long wait so that wasn't too bad. When the hostess took us back to the table almost every employee we past said enjoy your meal which was cool. Our server was bubbly and super nice. Our appetizers came out after we finished our meal I wasn't too upset about that because the manager gave us another free pazoki, and I was like awesome. I told them to sing happy birthday to my wife when we came in and they forgot. I saw the guy I told and gave him a jokingly hard time. The staff was great, food was good, but customer service was off the chain. Kudos Oregano staff, kudos."}
{"text":"Oreganos used to be better, but I feel like they are getting homogenized due to expansion. they were once much better. They are still great, and if i had not been coming here for over a decade, and never new about how it was i would still be impressed. Great choice if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"we've eaten here quite a few times, this last time we were so disgusted and didn't stay long because of all the flies flying around and all the dead flies that were in the window seal."}
{"text":"I want so badly to give them 5 stars. If I had written this several months ago it would have been 5... Not right now. I am very willing to come back and revise this if another visit in a few months proves this was a fluke.

When we visited Oreganos in Cave Creek the last two times (8 months ago and 2 months ago) we loved it. We ate at the bar and had wonderful service and great food. The last time I ordered the Antipasta salad and my friend ordered a pasta dish. Both were amazing in flavor and presentation. This prompted us to take a drive up and visit there again just a few days ago.

First - our server Hannah was a sweetheart. She understands customer service and was handling quite a few tables with grace and charm. She took very good care of us. All the stars are for Hannah. She should get 5. But I can't give my review 5.

We decided to share the Antipasta salad. I'm not sure if they have changed kitchen staff or maybe the owner is on vacation. We didn't get the same thing we had ordered just a few months ago. What we got looked more like a chopped Cobb salad. And it just wasn't all that good. We also ordered the Calamari. ... OH. MY. God. I have been eating calamari for decades. That was easily the WORST I have ever eaten.  Shoelaces. Breaded shoelaces served with a horrible 3 or 4 day old marinara sauce on the side. Horrible. It was inedible and the only reason my boyfriend ate it at all was because he was starving and the kitchen service was slow. 

Yes - seafood in the desert is probably not a good idea. Yes, I'm sure it was frozen. But I've bought frozen calamari and managed to not overcook it. IMHO the people who work in the kitchen have never seen calamari, don't know what it is, and certainly don't know how to cook it. The owner should either take it off the menu, or hold a class with the kitchen staff to show them the proper way to store and cook it. Here - this may help http://blog.williams-sonoma.com/the-secrets-of-meltingly-tender-squid-calamari/

Because we have had good food here we will visit one more time to make sure this wasn't a fluke. If it's better, I'll add to this review and change my rating."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I really enjoy this place. He loves the amazing pizza dishes, and I love the pasta! Each time we go there I get a different dish. He switches between the stuffed and regular deep dish pizza. We are never let down. And I'm the picky eater! The bread that comes along side is to die for! Authentic Italian flavor, great prices, great food! I can't wait to try the fettuccine next time!"}
{"text":"Why five stars? I wouldn't however what strikes me best about this location Is.....Consistency. sure I've been coming here since they opened.  This is my first review of them. and I'm happy that not only is the food consistently good on this particular night my server ZAC was very good and went above what I expected. 

This is the first time in years I've been given a cold side plate for my salad. . he's he was considerate enough to bring a cold side plate... how many times can you count thata server has done that?

Zac was cordial considerate and still like a ghost when he had to be..example,
My drinks for me and my friends were refilled and I didn't even see him do it.haha nice very nice...

Any way the food is good consistently and servers helpful"}
{"text":"Highly recommended to us. What?  We are currently sitting, waiting for our pizza. We were seated 40 minutes ago. We were just told it will be another 10-15 minutes. Unacceptable!  Two stars is generous, it's Christmas time. I'd add a photo, but it would be of an empty table.

Update: Nearly an hour now. Wait staff is making excuses. Downgrading to one star. Might have to send out for a pizza to tide us over.

Update: the pizza arrived and was just okay. It wasn't close to the best I've ever had. We probably won't return. Oregano's just isn't for us."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's and this location did not disappoint. I ordered for pickup and the cashier was very friendly. Cannot comment on service otherwise since I didn't experience it but I was enthusiastically greeted a couple times while in the restaurant. The food at Oregano's is always delicious, great portions, and very good prices. This was my first time trying sausage as an add-on to pasta and wow!!"}
{"text":"I have always loved this place over the years but they've become too popular.  They do NOT take reservations. Be prepared to wait 6000 years for a table. Then, once you are seated and able to order, be prepared to be told there is a 5000 year wait for pizza orders.  Huh?  I just think it's disrespectful of people's time. Just take reservations. Three+ hours for pizza etc? Lame."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for lunch, busy but worth the wait. Super friendly service, awesome portion sizes for the price. Deep dish pie was legit & rivals \"Lou Malnati's.\" Non five stars for some brown lettuce in our salad & the awkward decor of this place. Just something a bit odd about eating with a metal bed boxspring hanging above your head. Definitely be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Very good food. In town with friends for a wedding and great way to spend an evening. Lots of left over food."}
{"text":"Visiting the area and stopped by at 9pm with a party of 8. Our waitress was Alexa and everything was amazing! Among our party we had the stuffed mushrooms (delicious spicy Italian sausage, basil, cilantro, and marinara sauce), spinach artichoke dip, big beef sandwich, Italian wedding soup, and old fashioned sangria. We also had a birthday among us and they provided the BEST birthday dessert I've ever had - it was a HUGE warm chocolate chip cookie with several scoops of ice cream on top. AMAZING!  Alexa even included enough spoons for us all to try/share the dessert! SO impressive! The service was prompt, friendly, and professional. The environment was clean, the temperature comfortable, and the jazz music was a great compliment to the enjoyable ambiance of the restaurant. I'm sure that if I lived local, this would be a place we would frequently visit!"}
{"text":"A friend told us about Oregano's when we first moved to Mesa. The Pablo Picasso salad is our favorite. It is a Buca DE Beppo lite on the atmosphere, same casual less irreverent! We have 4 kids and this is a restaurant that we aren't embarrassed. Our kids are good but not perfect and no one here (worker or patron) has ever made them or us feel bad. The food is great!"}
{"text":"Gooood pizza, not crazy about the pasta is was a bit on the dry side, but gooood pizza. My husband and I always order one each so we can take home for the next day. The thin crust is our favorite, I love the Lawrence Original but avoid getting the wheat crust. I tried it one time for the heck of it and it really threw the taste off, I kinda regretted ordering it. If you're in the mood for appetizers, try the cheesey garlic bread, it's huge and comes with maranara sauce or  try the calamari is excellent, we really enjoyed that one. They have good beer, a lenghty list of wines. If you rather avoid the the wait, I suggest going on a weeknight, and even then we typically wait about 20 to 30 minutes, but it beats almost an hour on the weekends."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype is about? The salads are decent and a good value. The thin crust pizza is good, but have had better. 

The place gets crazy busy around 5 pm on a weekday leaving only outdoor seating available without wait. The plus is they have plenty of misters to keep the heat in check.

Try it out for yourself and hope you enjoy it more than I did."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times with friends, family, clients, dates and EVERY time the food and service was SUPER!  Never tasted a bad dish and loved the service.   EXCEPT for list last week.  Took my daughter for her birthday and it was my least favorite.  The Bruchetta was dry and the waiter called me a liar about my response to having a dish before stating \"we just added that 3 weeks ago\"  I don't know I just never got the right vibe from him and our service took over 2 hours and we didn't have a good time with our waiter.  Before this trip a 5 would be my rating but with this last trip the \"honeymoon\" feels over."}
{"text":"You know... I raved about this place weeks ago and came back today... And I just couldn't be unhappier. Service was slow and the bartenders walked by several times and didn't even ask how we're doing or if we needed anything... It took forever to get the check and even longer to get the box. We ordered some garlic cheese bread and it came out with the rest of the food we ordered instead of just an appetizer... We ordered a caesar salad and at first they sent the wrong one and we had no idea.. We wondered why it tasted so weird but then the staff (all three waiters) just stood there and stared at us eating it since it was the wrong one like we were criminals or something. My friend asked what was wrong and they said we had the wrong salad... As if it was our fault they brought it out to us. The wings we ordered were cold and hard which is why we even came back here again tonight. I will not be back at this location ever."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people wait for this lousy pizza.  Ordered half mushoom/pepperoni.  I swear the mushrooms were from a can and hardly any pepperoni.  I personally have eaten better pizza from a box.  It used to be better , but not anymore.  I have banned this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great experience. Food was good. We had a thin pizza and a ginormous salad.  Lots of customers but not too loud to have a pleasant conversation at our table. All that said, we were greeted and seated promptly and our waiter was fabulous. He was attentive but not intrusive. Thanks D'Angelo!"}
{"text":"My SIL invited my hubby and I to Oregano's for dinner when we were in town visiting, at the Old Town Scottsdale location. Man o' man...I had Uncle Frank's Sausage Pesto. If you like pesto and sausage...and who doesn't!...please try it. It is awesome. The sun-dried tomatoes gave it that kick that I so love. Oh! Don't forget to ask for the bucket of parmesan so your wonderful server can heap some on:-)"}
{"text":"Should be in the Top 5 restaurants in Scottsdale
AWESOME pizza. Seriously. Maybe Chicago's pizza is a bit better but this is hard to beat. They make it fresh and they make it good. The beer flows and food is delicious. This is the perfect place to take your co-workers for Happy Hour or a first date for a fun night out."}
{"text":"This review isn't really about Oregano's because it's always awesome every time I eat at any of the multiple locations.  This review is for Aaron M.  because he is a prime example of true hospitality.  We literally just dined there and I probably should have asked for the manager but I wanted to document it for everyone to see.  He was polite, very well-spoken, attentive, and efficient.  Coming from someone who has worked in the industry for many years, I am usually disappointed by the lack of service I encounter but not this time :) 

Anyhoo, just wanted to give a shout out to Aaron for providing great service.  Keep it up because this is what builds loyalty amongst customers."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times but this time was the absolute worst! My son and I were seated in the middle of the restaurant at a tall table. We were never acknowledged by a server let alone offered drinks. We sat around and waited for 10 minutes and eventually started to get up to leave. A server came rushing up to us to ask if anyone had helped us. We told him no and nobody had even acknowledged us. The server just offered a week apology and didn't try to retain us. On a Previous visit, there was an infestation of gnats hovering around the bar and side exit. We switched seats and ran into the same pests. The manager did offer a discount off of our meal. I don't think I want to go for a third strike... Very poor atmosphere here and seemingly high turnover with staff."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! The only reason I gave it a 3 is because it's always super packed and I get annoyed at waiting for so long for everything. I know that's not 100% their fault, but still. You have to get the pazookie if you go here. My favorite dish is Alfredo the dark w/ chicken. Yum! Definitely a favorite if we bring in guests from out of state."}
{"text":"I had never been to this location before my visit on Friday to meet a friend for happy hour.  The first thing I found out is they have no happy hour.  Big disappointment, but we stayed because we hadn't seen in ages & we had tons to talk about.   Scratch the talking...the music was so insanely loud that we could not have a discussion.   After asking the waitress if the music could be turned down,to no avail,  we then we also asked the  manager, who seemed affronted.   As the volume seemed to increase,  we asked to be moved to someplace quieter.   Apparently the only quiet speakers were out on the patio, so we moved outside & braved the heat, just to have a conversation.    NOT!!  As soon as our food arrived,  the volume increased on the patio at least by double. We asked the waitress outside if it was possible to reduce the volume,  we were told no, so we asked for boxes for our food, and the check.    We tossed back our drinks & paid for food we would have to take home & heat up.   Not as much as a discount on our check either.   We will not return to this location!"}
{"text":"Was a great experience 
Chicken parmigiana sandwich with waffle fries 
Wife had pasta with sausage and the quality 
was definitely there 
Would recommend with a couple of Coronas
Update 
Returned for dinner we were having a great time till server lost a tray of drinks which ended up all over my wife
Managers all disappeared at that point and never surfaced
We were very polite about situation, but were just  handed our full bill
Did expect an apology or compensation on our bill
But management which were all over us initially were no where to be found"}
{"text":"An East Valley Icon, Oreganos is a place you must visit once. The Pizza and Pasta selection is unparalleled at least in the Tempe area. It's also one of the few more authentic places here as well. My favorite entree is Called Alfredo the Dark. The service here is great too. My group was supposed to be 7 but a few extra people showed up and they were able to accommodate us with ease. I think the cookie ice cream desert is the real reason I come here though. I know it as the pizookie from BJ's but I'm sure the wait staff will know what you mean. It's a great place for groups in general."}
{"text":"We love Oreganos! Always friendly service and great food. Our favorite is splitting the Caesar salad or the Pablo Picasso salad (spicy, yum!). The Clarke Street is our favorite pizza, the boom dip is great, and the garlic lime Parmesan wings are heavenly. But, don't eat too much because you have to save room for a PAZOOKIE!! 

The food is great, but the service we get is always better. Darby is by far our favorite server. She is wonderful at her job, and it is so fun to have dinner when she is serving. There is nothing more enjoyable than going into a restaurant and being served by someone who loves their job."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had dined at the Gilbert location. I am already a huge fan of the chain so I knew it would be good. I ordered the lunch sized portion of the Alfredo the Dark. It was a good but lacking in the cheese department. We had great service and after a wait at the door, our food happened very quickly. Also wish I could remember our servers name because he was on top of everything and moved with a sense of purpose. Definitely made it easy for us to be in and out!"}
{"text":"Tried to order a salad and sandwich for takeout at 5:30 on a Friday. They said pickup would be 7:15! Absolutely insane, I don't care how busy you are!"}
{"text":"We love the theme of oregano's. super cozy to come here on a date. We ordered parmesan chicken with Caesar salad and enjoyed it so much! Would totally recommend this place to anyone! We've come here on multiple events with big groups and just me and my husband at times and the customer service here never let us down. Super friendly waiters and great food and will never go bad. Also they have really good Thin crust pizza"}
{"text":"Tasty food with plenty to share!! We actually split the chicken Parmesan over a bed of Alfredo pasta. It was delightful and filling! We of course had to save room for the famous cookie pizza! Absolutely amazing! The wait time on a Monday afternoon was the average 30 minutes. Service was wonderful."}
{"text":"I brought my mom here, she flew in from Idaho and her favorite place is Oreganos.  Was anxious to have dinner but things didn't go the way we expected.  The only reason that I am giving a one star is the service was terrible.  We have been coming to different locations of Oregano's for years and years and have never had bad service.  But this time things got kinda confused with the waitress I guess........apparently there was a mixup in regards to who was taking care of our table.  There was a managers meeting in the back and our waitress decided to take our table, but then had other employees bring us refills on drinks and our food.  Our waitress forgot about us, we were done for about 10 minutes and decided not to order the pizzookie (which is our favorite) because it would have taken another 15 minutes.  Such a bummer tonight, we will come back again just disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Pumpkin beer was great. Only reason I'm rating  them a 2 is  because they have no Wi-Fi! Get with it."}
{"text":"This place is a corporate chain joke. It's for people who think dominoe's is good. If the crust ain't fresh... It's not a pizza in my book. And I thought a Margherita was supposed to have cheese!  It's just a bar with bad bar food for real. Young staff, and we all know what that means. Don't waste your time or $. If you do, don't say I didn't warn you.!"}
{"text":"It was our first night at Oreganos as a blended family. I'm the mom and I've finally met the man of my dreams. We bought a house just down the way. Unfortunately- our ticket got lost. We were happily enjoying a bottle of wine and conversation and before we could eve ask what happened... A manger came out and took care of everything. We even were moved to a table with a heater- as we were outside and it was cold. Thank you Oreganos, for making our dinner a success!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with our pizza we ordered for take out tonight. I asked for a little thicker crust and it was still pretty thin and hardly any sauce. Very dry and It was like eating a cheese crisp."}
{"text":"I really do not see what the big deal is with this place waitress is awesome but the food was just overly spiced and sauced frozen pasta I miss Joey's of Chicago which was there at one time will not be going back I like my Stouffer's alot better"}
{"text":"They have been teasing us for far to long with this site.  Sign up, Sign covered, build a unique Oregano's building and deny it's an Oregano's, then walla it's an Oregano's.

I am so glad to have this eating establishment close by.  The shops at Pecos Ranch are a needed addition to the area.

Eats:
Meatball Sandwich w/ sweet potato fries - Hugh and delicious
Big Rig Pasta - Delicious and spicy
The Big Beefstro Salad - Even the small is hugh

Will get the Deep Pizza or lasagna next time when I have more time."}
{"text":"This place is packed on Friday nights. This place is pretty nice, the outdoor seating could be very romantic if it was not so crowded. The staff and food are all good here and very cheap. 

We started with the Boom dip and it was delicious. It was a great way to start our meal. I got the Meatball sandwich. It came with four huge meatballs and criss cross fries. I ended up only being able to eat a fourth of the sandwich. And even though i felt like i had eaten so much my stomach was about to burst, we ordered a Pizza Cookie. It was simply a perfect way to finish a wonderful, super filling dinner on a Friday night."}
{"text":"It's all about service  These guys can't figure out how to get a carry out pizza done on time.  No, I don't want a free soda to wait another 15 minutes for the pizza past the time you told me to pick it up.  And the fact that you won't take a credit card over the phone .. wake up ... it's 2015.   Too many other pizza joints that care about the customer!"}
{"text":"Good food and drinks as long as you are prepared to wait if going during normal rush times."}
{"text":"I guess we just expected better based on reviews. The Chicago pan crust was just OK. It looked good, but was very dough-y and not enough cheese. Maybe we needed to order the \"stuffed\" pizza instead. Oddly enough, the item that was a hit was the Pablo Picasso salad (as we placed our order I'm thinking, \"who orders a Mexican salad at an Italian restaurant?\"). Well...it was delicious...and huge!"}
{"text":"Never had a dish I didnt like. My favorite is the anti-pasta salad (jr size feeds 4) and Italian Gold wings. (Mustard based sauce).  

We try ti go off hours as the line can be brutal. Other great thing is the GIANT drinks. 32 oz glasses for soda that take you through the whole meal. They will also give you a glass for the road ob your way our. 

If you like Italian the menu is extensive but is not light on carbs. I always find something tastey. Typical bill is about 25 for two."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. The pizza is great and the Salads are awesome. The service is on point. But the wait can sometimes be too long. This is an old college standby."}
{"text":"The best pizza with exceptional service. I was there exactly one year ago...I'm headed back to AZ next week & this will be my first stop. Absolutely DELISH!!!"}
{"text":"I've indulged in a number of pizzerias...this is as good as it gets!!! Every year I'm in Phoenix its a MUST that I hit them up. 
Can't go wrong with pizza, wings & a good drink!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the deep stuffed and it was absolutely amazing! Very tasty and full of flavor! Totally recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I waited over 45 min for a $25 pizza that tasted like a frozen deep dish pizza you get from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Oreganos has been one of my favorite restaurants for the last 5 years or so. I was really excited when I found out that one was coming to Goodyear. My go to items include the big rig pasta w/sausage, Pablo Picasso salad, boom dip and pazookie. I usually pick up considering how close this one is to home, but dining in is always a great experience at any Oreganos. Customer service is always top notch. And you gotta love the decor/music. All around a great and authentic restaurant!"}
{"text":"Have drank and eaten here many times.  Food is excellent and large portions. Prices are very reasonable.   Service is good.  The only thing we noticed was right while we were sitting at bar having a drink, the bartender decided to take her tip and cleared off all the remaining change we had on the bar.   Never saw that done like that before.   We hope she isn't there next time we go in   And it wasn't like she was leaving.   So we did.  I guess we would just like to leave our own tip..??"}
{"text":"Meh pizza is ok but the clientele here is usually rude, especially if you have kids. As someone with Italian roots who grew up in New York then Philly this makes no sense, Italian places are about family. Staff try to make up for this with promises of this or that but then fail to deliver... make the trip down to Spinato's instead you will be happier"}
{"text":"Spinach dip and thin crust pizza with a bottle of wine. Love this place! Their mix drinks are lovely also. Dirty Monkey! Mmm..."}
{"text":"Only been to this oreganos 2 times and the first time was alright not really any complaints but this second time last night was awful. A couple of friends and I walked in at maybe 9:20 and ordered a salad and a pizza that took 45 minutes to come out. So it's now 10:15 and they are closed so we look like the rude ones but we tried to get in and eat before they closed at 10 but we just got really bad service from the bartender. Who the entire 45 minutes we were waiting did not fill up our waters once. Did not give us silverware till about 6 minutes after the salad came out so we sat their staring at it for a while then the pizza came out finally, I understand the wait time for food because all 3 of us work in the restaurant industry but it was hard to try and be happy when we received the kind of service we did. And another server was walking around while all of our glasses were empty she was sweeping and I understand it's not your table and your finishing up your side work or whatever but at least have the decency to say hey your table doesn't have any water... but nothing. Not a good experience at all. Wish I could have said something more positive but their is nothing more to say..."}
{"text":"The food is OK but pricey, but my complaint is that there is always an hour wait to get a seat. I've been there 4 times and whether is for a table of 4 or 8 it always over an hour. They never offer a sampling or drink and the hostesses aren't that friendly. The wait staff are always trying to upsell and to top it off I asked for an extra piece of garlic toast because the piece I got with my pasta dish was very small and they charged me $1. Oh , if you want the deep dish pizza , that's another hour wait!!!! My family like the place but I can think of dozens of restaurants that are just as good , cheaper and don't take forever to get a seat."}
{"text":"Terrible experience at this particular Oreganos. We were greeted and sat quickly as there were only a handful of occupied tables between the dining area and outdoor patio area on this Saturday lunchtime. Placed our order as we told our server we wanted to start with a Big Beefstro salad as an appetizer and then have our entrees after. Placed our order and within minutes our entrees arrived (delivered by another server) and then a short time after our server came by with a puzzled look, (they didn't get their salad) and said nothing. We proceeded to eat what we could of our below standard for Oreganos entrees (bowl-o-pasta and shroom boom pasta). With half full plates the waiter proceeded to bring our bill, (with the big Beefstro salad that we never saw still on the bill) and never once asked if our meals were ok, if we needed drink refills, or if we would like boxes (luckily we didn't want the nasty leftovers) About 8-10 minutes later when he came for our payment, I told him that the salad that we never got was still on the bill, and he never once recognized anything about the MIA salad, and just said \"I'll take that off\". Oreganos is a favorite of our family in our city, and this store needs help. We were very disappointed paying the check at this location."}
{"text":"Always a great meal! Tried the Lady is a Scampi pasta dish on this occasion. Pretty good. Nice kick of spicy. Our hands down favorite is the Big Rig. Always enough food to split to save room for a Pazookie aka pizza cookie;) However, this time it was a little over cooked and they skimped on the cookie dough. Probably why it was over done. Still yummy though!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites although I no longer live here.  Still the same as I remember, BIG portions, very friendly staff, and good food!  Brought my friends here from CA and they loved it!  Their eyes were much bigger than their stomachs.  Had the \"Riga Tony\" which was heavy but the smallest portion sized dish at our table, friends had the \"Dark Alfraid O\", cheese pizza, and Bollo Pasta, all of which they enjoyed.  Bellinis were great as always, and the pinot grigio was  smooth.  The reason I gave it 4 stars outta 5 is the wait is terribly long (you have to go during lunch or non peak hours).  We arrived at 7pm didn't get seated until 8pm and finished up at 9pm.  If you have the time then it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Always great food, drinks and service. The food items all have large portions, easily shareable."}
{"text":"I had seen Oregano's in Tucson and always wanted to try it. I was happy when my bff and her husband suggested we eat here when we came to visit. I think a lot of people felt like pizza that night because it was sooo crowded even on a weekday! We were brave enough to sit outside on the patio in the murderous Phoenix heat, so we didn't have to wait. Agreeing on a shared pizza for four people is difficult, so we just had cheese, tomato, and basil. It was very basic, but very good, and the large fed all of us comfortably. My friend is always on a diet, so we had the thin crust instead of the deep dish which was perfect for our type of pizza. We also shared a small dinner salad which was plenty for all of us too. The service was great and they were very attentive in refilling our water which was good because it felt like we were eating in the Sahara. We also shared their version of a BJ's Pizookie and that was delicious of course! My friend and I had a frozen Bellini which was perfectly cold and yummy but weak in the alcohol content. My boyfriend said his margarita was really weak as well. Kind of expensive, but this ain't Domino's. I would come again."}
{"text":"Plenty of parking space and waiting room which is much needed since you're going to be waiting 45 minutes. Service is average,  not good.  Pizza was great and prices were on the higher side."}
{"text":"Just opened so waiting is to be expected. Good food, good pizza. Nice patio and outside bar. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Good food but only got 2 out of 3 pizzas. Slow service. Wanted to close so would not serve beer. Had an hour before they were closing."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner close to closing (9:25). The staff treated us amazing and were very welcoming. The portions were large and very good. It was a clean, family friendly environment. Would recommend and come back!
* Sean was our server and he did an excellent job."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Robin was on top of everything. If you are wanting a full tummy and friendly service this is the place to come. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We love oregano's. You can't go wrong here with so many dishes to choose from. We love the Caesar salad with the shaved chicken on it, yum!  I also now have my entire family a fan of their Brussels sprouts, too. Love the thin crust pizza and cheesy garlic bread!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service, and the place wasn't busy..  It doesn't get ANY worse than this. Yeh, Jim H,  I'm from Chicago [Kenilworth] , too.  The crust is an insult to real Chicago deep dish pizza.  Yuck."}
{"text":"Great location! Right next to Harkins and super close to the mall. 

Service here was amazing! Came the day after they opened, so of course the wait was enormous, but that is to be expected. What made the wait bareable? The air-conditioned waiting room! I have been to my fair share of Oregano's and I've never seen this before. The worst part of the wait is the heat and having to wait for food and drinks.. In the waiting room, the TV keeps you occupied, as well as the active-sampling and server that brings drinks and food into the waiting room. Wonderful idea!

Food was amazing, as always. Service was great, I assume because of the want to make a first impression on new customers. I'd hate to see it go downhill, so keep up the amazing service! Valerie, Joscelyn, and Parker were all great.

We'll certainly be back for more pizookie."}
{"text":"I really like this place the only real problem is the long lines and realative lack of space due to the large number of people trying to grab a slice of this goodness. Lots on the menu with many styles of pizza available and a value slice for the smaller pocket. Cold beer at the bar. Hurry up and open at the PV Mall. See you there for some italian goodness"}
{"text":"We religiously dine at several Oregano locations throughout the valley and love it however if you like Oreganos skip this location at all costs.  Horrible service, unorganized and unprofessional staff, music twice as loud as other locations and wait times for your food three times longer than other locations.  A real bummer no excuse all the other locations are just as busy or busier.  We had to wait until our pizza was cold and almost gone before we could get a servers attention to grate some cheese on it.  Other locations offer it immediatly when the pie hits your table.  We waited 45 minutes for salads and a pizza and then had to tell them which ingredients were missing.  If I owned this location I would sure notice that all other locations get 4+ stars and this place is below average with some terrible reviews wake up ownership wake up management this location is tarnishing your fine reputation!"}
{"text":"First time at Oregano's. We started with the Garlic Cheese Bread which was good. Followed by ordering two pizzas. We started with a thin cheese pizza. Now maybe it is being Chicago style but wasn't into the lack of sauce. My kids barely ate it. We also ordered a pan pizza. Thought this was much better. Wish I would have saved room for it as I could only eat one slice."}
{"text":"My clients took me here and let's be real, free food always tastes better! I had the Alfredo the Dark and it was pretty good, but honestly the sauce could've used a bit more flavor. The cheesy bread with marinara sauce was good too. If I was in the area, I wouldn't mind coming back, but I'd prob get something else. Also the lunch portion is perfect size and the dinner portion is huge."}
{"text":"Oh sweet Oregano's!!!! This is a place that my old co-workers and amigos gather to enjoy some Gibbilini Bellinis!!!! As well as their amazing pizza!! The patio is our favorite spot  for our retreats and we have also enjoyed the great treatment their staff has given us so far!! Great spot!!! Specifically this location!! Yay!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, as someone who used to live in Chicago, and has eaten my fair share of Chicago-style pizza, I was ready to hate on a Chicago Pizza Joint in Phoenix. Despite my doubts, we decided to take our friend's advice and try this place. We rolled up on a Sunday night, and there was 45 minute wait which seemed to be a good sign.

Once we were finally seated, we were served by the peppiest server I have ever had in my life. Seriously, ever. At one point, when I asked for a refill on my water, she took my glass and SQUEALED, \"Water! Yay!\" Never have I felt so affirmed in my choice of beverage! Thanks, peppy server.

As for the pizza, it was so, SO good. Deep dish, perfect crust, juicy tomatoes. No hating necessary--this is a Phoenix pizza joint that's worthy of the Chicago label! If we ever make it back to Phoenix, we will definitely stop back at Oregano's!"}
{"text":"So we all ordered from work. Not the first time. They forgot the dressing for someones salad. I called them to let them know. I told them I didn't want any freebies just the dressing. Guess what the manager did? Yep, he delivered it. Now that's customer service. They get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food, alcoholic drinks and service. The wait is usually between 25-45 minutes but it is worth it. We go at least twice a month. And they will modify super spicy dishes to make them less spicy."}
{"text":"Usually love Oreganos, but dang if tonight didn't disappoint!!!  We ordered for takeout (recognizing it's a Friday night, so expected it to take awhile).  Ordered the Oregano's Classic salad w chicken, an order of golden wings extra crispy, and Brussels sprouts.  Let me just say, the Brussels sprouts are the only redeeming part of this meal...the wings are not only not extra crispy, they are literally cold and soggy.  Blech.  The salad is also not good, the lettuce is wilted and black on the edges...it's basically inedible.  The Brussels are great, however!  I think the issue w the wings is that, when we arrived to pick it up, they were already done but were \"waiting on the salad\"...which took 20 more minutes!  Not sure why the salad was prepared after the wings, but having them sit in a plastic takeout container while a salad was prepared, didn't probably do them any justice.  I hate giving bad reviews, I really do...especially to places I normally love...but this was disappointing tonight...so much so that I've ordered a salad and wings from another restaurant.  Eek!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix if not anywhere!  Be warned though...you will have to wait most of the time.  We just plan that into our evening there (go an hour before we want to eat).  However, they have 3 bar areas that are open seating so you can always wait for one of those.

FOOD - If you haven't tried the deep dish Chicago-style pizza, go there tonight and get it!  It's the best thing on the menu and it's worth the 45 minute wait for it to cook (you can order it while your waiting to save time).  We get the Sproccoli and add chicken to it.  If you're in the mood for pasta, the Zany Ziti is out of this world (it's baked in a breadbowl).  Their salads are awesome as well (favorite is the Antipasto Thing).  The Garlic Cheese Bread is huge and really good!  And of course, you can't forge tthe Pizza Cookie (or Pizzokie).  It's outstanding....barely cooked cookie dough covered in ice cream!

SERVICE - It's always been excellent.  The staff is extremely friendly.  We've never had any issues at all with the service.

PRICE - We can eat here with a salad, pizza, and dessert for around $35 for 2 of us.  (And we ususally have left-over pizza as well.)

Trust me...go to Oregano's, get the Chicago Stuffed Pizza and you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations. I had chicken parmigiana and my wife a shrimp scampi dish. Both were most excellent. We will be back, most definitely. Drinks were good, but the $4 dollar upgrade to my margarita was a little excessive."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service!!
Definitely recommend the zany ziti. 
It was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"They defiantly need to work out a few kinks but this location is pretty good. The 5 or 6 hostess girls that all say \"welcome\" the second you open the door in their most annoying baby voice has got to be toned down a bit, for sure!  (Why so many hostesses btw? You don't seat people for 45 minutes anyway, it's not like they are bringing people back to tables...)"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok...we like a lot of flavor (our favorite pizza place is Fired Pie) and we weren't \"amazed\" but it wasn't bad either...comfortable atmosphere, clean, and acceptable service, expected prices... Basically, we would return if nearby and convenient but we won't be craving it..."}
{"text":"Absolutely great! Excellent staff and food and perfect scene for families. Always go here. Definitely try the stuffed rigatoni"}
{"text":"Very weak knock off of Chicago style pizza. Had an \"at best\" generic tasting Caesar salad followed by a stuffed crust pizza. Not even remotely as good as Giordano's. Crust was ok and the pizza sauce was bitter. Inside of pizza was lukewarm.

Definitely not a return for me."}
{"text":"New location is closer to home Food and service are quite good like Gilbert. However NO PLACE is worth the rediculous wait times. 2 hrs for dine in or 90 min for TAKE OUT"}
{"text":"Visted 5/6/12...

I have been to Oregano's many times.  Another one of those places that I just never got around to writing about I guess. 

My favorite is the Chicken Pesto Pizza.  That is my regular when I go here.  But there are many food options. 

There are several across the valley and I have been to many.  I have not had a bad experience at any of them.  They tend to be very busy, so be prepard to wait 15-20 to get a table.  We were there about 4:30 on Sunday and there was already the beginning of a line. 

This time, had an exceptional experience.  We had finished an order of the Stuffed Mushrooms, huge portabellos with sausage, a side salad, and were almost half way through our pizze (Chicken Pesto of course) when the manager brought out a second pizza.  He told us that when he walked by, he did not like how our first one looked, so he made us a second one.  I never noticed a problem with the first.  Bonus leftover food as a result.  

Nice to know there is some quality control behind the scenes. 

Oregano's will always be a go to place for me."}
{"text":"Took my daughter and son in law to dinner at Oregano's and they loved it. They're planning another visit soon and already know what they want to eat!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years...  I'm not personally a fan of their marinara sauce so I don't like the pizza in general.  However I love their salads and pasta with chipotle or Alfredo!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Antipasto salad, regular portion, and wow! This salad was massive - definitely enough for two people. When offered the lunch side I was concerned it would be tiny, but maybe that would have been the way to go. Although I was able to save half of my regular size to eat the next day for lunch - yum! If you love Antipasto salads (my favorite) definitely give this a go. I thought I grabbed a crouton and it turned out to by a tiny delicious fried mozzarella ball! The Italian dressing was meh, I personally like Brothers Pizza dressing better but this salad was so hearty that you didn't need dressing anyways. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars was when I ordered to go I was told 10 minutes and when I arrived 15 minutes later, I then had to wait another 7(ish) minutes before my salad was ready. Other than that, great experience! Next time I plan to sit and eat at the restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Fanfreakingtastic! Superfluous! And any other awesome words to describe how kick ass the service and food is. Chris the bartender?! Seriously?! One word... perfect!  This is one place you Can't afford to miss. Absolute must!"}
{"text":"Went here for a work lunch (group of 9) and the hostess and the waitresses were very accomodating (given our size and needing to move tables once due to our growing group).  They got all our orders correct and I was happy that they were able to get my order correct as I was that 'pain-in-the-bum' customer that had the requests for 'no' this and 'no' that.  The Manager even came out to make sure that my order (with all the picky stuff) was correct - I was impressed with that, so kudos to the guy who manages that place!  The ambiance is nice and you can't go wrong with their food for lunch (minus the food coma you get afterwards).  I want to go back after I'm done with this allergy detox diet I'm doing and enjoy a nice big meatball sandwich!"}
{"text":"Holy Moly the servings here are LARGE! We all had pasta dishes, sadly no pizza :( next time, I'm getting a pizza! I highly recommend their pesto pasta in a garlic bread bowl, add chicken to it, yum! And, I really enjoyed their house salad with house made italian dressing. We came at a perfect time, 8:00-ish....so we missed what looked like a huge dinner rush. Overall great dining experience, great food, and good service. We will eat here again!"}
{"text":"On 2/25/18 at around 4:00 P.M. I took my wife and daughter to dinner.  Today was my daughter's
birthday.  My family has been patronizing this location for over 10 years, because of its excellent food and bubbly service.  When we walked in, it didn't seem that busy.  The hostess took my name and number and told me it would be 10-15 minutes.  She wasn't smiling and seemed bothered.  While looking around I saw an unoccupied booth.  When I approached the booth, the male waiter in the area aggressively told me to wait to be called.  At that point I decided to leave.  The bartender even frowned at me on the way out.  This location has really gone downhill.  It used to be the best Oregano's in the East Valley or the state for that matter.  I don't know if it is the increased competition in the area or the fact my family is African-American.  Avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"This is an incredibly popular spot so it is ALWAYS busy.  The staff is always friendly.  The food is always exceptional.   And really, overall, the prices are good!  The only drawback is, the last 4 times we've been there it has taken a really long time to get our food and then get our bill.  We just know that we need to plan for the extra time."}
{"text":"This place was just, well, terrible.  Seriously.  If you are looking for mediocre chain Italian food, just save your money and go to Olive Garden instead.  We got the calamari appetizer which was hands down the worst I've ever had.  The breading was thick and gummy and tasted like week old clam cakes.  The pasta was a mushy mess and was way overcooked.  Not al dente at all.  Sauce was just plain awful.  I come from an Italian family, had a little Italian grandma who loved to cook, and I have dined out at many Italian restaurants all over the place.  I'm originally from Providence (awesome foodie city, great Italian on Federal Hill) and I spend a lot of time dining out at Italian places in NYC.  I know what I am talking about when it comes to Italian.  This place doesn't even come close."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and I was not disappointed. The food was so delicious! I ordered the calamari because I couldn't resist trying it here. My husband got the meatball baked sandwich which I had a bite of and it was sooo good. Calamari was fried like a chicken strip and it tasted better than I expected it to. Our server was nice but very busy. Luckily we didn't need much. The manager also walked around and made sure everyone was doing well which I loved. Definitely will be eating here more often."}
{"text":"I love trying different pizzas with the hope of finding the perfect pie. While in Phoenix, Oregano's was recommended to us by some locals so we thought we would try it. It must be popular because when we arrived on Saturday evening there was a wait of well over one hour. Frustrating, and not really their fault. In fact, they were good with passing out some pizza samples and getting people drinks. Once we got in, we tried a Chicago deep dish pizza. It is very filling and overall not bad, even with a distinct oregano enhanced flavor. But, the pizza was overwhelmed with pizza sauce, and the crust was not entirely cooked in places. Despite aIl this it was worth the trip and discovery, but I'm not sure I'd endure the wait again."}
{"text":"The pizza by the slice at lunch is huge. One slice filled me up. The thin crust style is awesome. And the price ($2.49) for a slice is ridiculously cheap. Parking and wait times may be a hassle. Also, the waiter was distracted and sub-par."}
{"text":"We sat down at 3pm on a slow wed afternoon, the waitress took our order and we didn't get our order for 30mins. We ordered wings, 1 salad, pasta with meatballs. When the order did come they forgot the meatballs. The waitress was hardly sympathetic. The food is great but the service is much less than great. Poor management. The manager should have offered some consolation but did not and is not a surprise given the waitresses poor service..."}
{"text":"They have done it! They are back to the Oreganos we loved. Great food and great service. We highly recommend you give them a chance. We are back to visiting them 3-4 times a month and love every visit."}
{"text":"Had the best dinner as a family. Sat promptly. Staff and manager were extremely friendly. Food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Every time I come in I like to try something new but I am a huge fan of the Alfredo the Dark and thin crust pizza"}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious!!!! Have eaten here quite a few times and it's always good. Don't think I have ordered anything I haven't enjoyed. Plus their portions are huge. A side salad for 3.79 is enough for 2-3 ppl. Hubby and I share a salad and a meal and we're stuffed. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"An Italian chain loved by most of Phoenix, but overhyped.

In my experience, the wait for a table is usually an hour or close to it. A cost far too high for the dining experience that is to ensue. Once seated the restaurant has a very interesting theme. It seems like there is a lot of work put into gathering all of the wall decorations. The decorations remind me of something I would expect to see at a TGIF or a Buca di Beppo, another Italian chain.

The appetizers we enjoyed all were very good. I would recommend the bruschetta, cheesy bread, and wings. The service on getting us our drinks was very slow and the beer was not very good. The pizza itself was better than most pizza I have here in the valley. 

Margarita poor and tastes no flavor

Boom Dip spinach and artichoke choke and cheese dip on Parmesan flatbread
Hey Barry shareable appetizer that was quite good except for the fact it was greasy far too oily

Numero- One-o thin crust pizza
Pepperoni mushroom sausage onion green pepper
Very greasy needs spices"}
{"text":"Second time enjoying O's food. All I can say is yum! Good and attentive service at a fair price. My Italian fave.
Forgot to mention I am part Italian, so I am particular. Also my first five star!"}
{"text":"Best meatball sandwich! Rivals my mommas. Worth it!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of pizzas, pastas, & most importantly pizzokies then this is definitely the place for you! Of all the things I've tried at Oreganos, my favorites have been the vegetarian sandwich with waffle fries, the Alfredo the dark with chicken pasta dish, & the Pablo Picasso salad. I've also tried a few other times which haven't disappointed!

If you're going for lunch, they also have a pizza slice special. Don't be fooled, the slice you receive is really big & filling! The bowl o pasta is also a really good deal! All the items I've had have been very large in portion, ample serving to share.

Just a note that if you're planning to pick up an order, give yourself plenty of time. You might have to wait up to 30 minute for a salad on a busy night but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"what's not to like about this place..... only draw-back is it sooooooo crowded after 5 and on week-ends...so we take-out"}
{"text":"Huge portions. I'm a big guy and I could only eat 1/2 tuna sandwich. Food was tast and service very friendly. Nice outdoor patio. Also try Liberty Market a block away"}
{"text":"Came here after walking out of the dumpy Mexican place across the street. I couldn't be happier with the experience here. Was greeted by three people at the front door and immediately seated. Being from Chicago and from the pizza business, I was skeptical but, the place smelled right. Joseph waited on us and was great. We had a 16\" half cheese and half sausage thin crust. The sausage and sauce were just like some of Chicago's best. The crust was a little thin for me but, crispy and tasted great. I will be coming back here with the rest of my family soon. HIGHLY recommend that you try this place if you want Chicago style pizza."}
{"text":"Finally tried out this place with my friend at her insistence. Great pasta. I had the big rig pasta dish. It was very spicy and very delicious."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. The food is always dependable, the service is a crapshoot and the wait time for a salad is ridiculous. But it's always busy, so maybe I just catch them on off days. 

2 stars for the pizookie - they are always out of this world good!

I don't go out of my way to eat here anymore. Shame, because the one down in Tempe used to be one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"We usually go to a different Oregano's (somewhere in the middle of Phoenix  on Camelback or or something?) and this is is similar - good food good service!!  The only complaint is parking.  Do all Oregano's parking suck or what?  Small lot, crammed spaces.  I guess that is the beauty of it all.  Let's jam everybody together like one big happy family!

If you like Oregnao's this place won't disappoint.  If it's your first time they make great meatball sandwiches, salads, deep dish pizza (and others) and of course pasta!!  Come with an appetite!"}
{"text":"We've been to a few Oregano's locations and this one was probably the least good.  The service was OK, the meatball sub wasn't as good as the hubs remembered it being at other places and my veggie sub was quite nice.  I'd never had it before so I can't compare but I enjoyed - just not lovvvved it.  I do thoroughly enjoy going to Oregano's but if there's another location you can go to, I would.  We were in the area for our staycation so that's why we went here."}
{"text":"Our experience from start to finish lasted over 2 hours.  Needless to say, after an hour of waiting, I told my husband, \"This place better be damn good.\"  And it was.

It must have been prom night, hence the long wait; however, seeing how they had so many benches for people to sit at while they waited to be called, they are probably busy every night.  The hostess even came up to us to see if we wanted anything to drink.  We weren't even charged for our iced tea.

After an hour of waiting, we finally got seated and our server was nice, informative, and tended to our needs in a pretty timely fashion.  He didn't even mind that our 14 month old daughter kept tugging at his belt.  

We ordered the honey mustard wings and sweet potato fries as starters and they were delicious.  The chicken wings were a little on the \"too fried\" side but I think that's relative to your own palette.  The flavor was awesome.  The sweet potato fries was delectable.  Definitely tasted like they were using \"fresh oil\" to fry the fries instead of \"old oil\".  That's always a good thing.

We ordered a 10\" Chicago style deep dish with sausage and pepperoni.  O.M.G.  That's all I can say about it!!  It was awesome!!  I could only eat one piece, however, b'c I was so full!  Our dishes definitely came out slow but our waiter did inform us of this beforehand so we weren't disappointed about it.  Besides, you can rush good pizza, right?!

I don't know how busy they are any other time of the day but we got there around 4:30pm on a Friday and waited an hour to get seated.  I definitely recommend coming here to try out their food but if wait is a concern, make sure you call ahead to see if they are busy!

I want to emphasize the really great service.  We were asked how our meal went, our waiter was really nice, and we were given a warm good-bye, too!!  Thanks for a great experience Oregano's!"}
{"text":"No joke first time here it was the experience I've ever had in a restaurant ever KONA is the guy you got to see from the best service ever I will definitely keep coming back and will refer everybody I can to come and eat here and specifically ask him couldn't of asked for better service and if he serves you tip him well
#team kona"}
{"text":"Staff was great. All very nice and accommodating.
However, the Big Rig Pasta was been watered down during our last couple visits, and my friends also agree. The large plate is now a smaller bowl and there is less sauce and chicken. It's just not the same. I could tell they've become very cheap with this menu item."}
{"text":"Not Impressed at ALL!!!  Had to wait nearly 45 minutes when we were told the wait was 20 minutes.  I really didnt enjoy standing in the middle of the parking lot waiting for my table!  When we were finally seated I felt right at home because our table was also in the parking lot! LOL!
I planned on ordering the eggplant lasagna - until my friend pointed out it took 45 minutes to cook - no thanks.  I want outta here quick.  Instead I ordered the Lady is a Scampi - I will describe it as strange.  My friend ordered a pasta dish also and a side order of the Giant Meatball.  When the \"Giant Meatball\" came out it wasnt giant it was all cut up in the sauce - aka meat sauce.  One good thing was the food came out quick so once we were finally seated we were outta there quick.  I wont be back."}
{"text":"The customer service is always on point. After that, all the food is sooooooooo good! No mater what you get, you will not be disappointed! The only problem is that the place is always packed lol"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place for lunch the other day. This is my nephew and his girlfriends favorite spot so had to get a gift card and thought I would try lunch. I had the italian grinder and the boy that tagged along had the big rig-atoni. Can't decide which one I liked better, his or mine! I really like the spicy sauce on the rigatoni and my grinder was really good. We sat outside on the patio right by the fire which was really great and reminded me of why I love Arizona, after Thanksgiving and we have all these fantastic restaurants with patio's to enjoy! My grinder had cappicola ham which made me very happy! The waffle fries are good but not fantastic, a litle more batter than anything and way to crispy. For dessert we had to try the pizza cookie and it was warm, yummy, gooey goodness! We had the chocolate chip and it is huge, plenty for 2 with lots of ice cream. Service was great and we ended up getting their special buy $100 in gift cards and get $20 free since we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My family and I came in for the first time last night and couldn't have been more pleased. I put off oregano's for the longest time believing it would be your average Italian place yet they have innovated menu options and their service was amongst the best I've had in awhile."}
{"text":"Here are some important things I think you should know,
about this restaurant that they call Oregano. 

The wait here is always about an hour long,
And with their overrated pizza, a wait like that seems wrong.

I'm not a huge fan of their thin pizza crust,
It tastes like saltine crackers, and that makes it a bust.

I think their deep dish crust is just A-OK,
The dough is way to gummy, there's not much else to say.

They also load the pizza with disgusting wads of cheese,
Even people from Chicago, this pizza cannot please.

They use shredded chicken as a pizza and salad topping,
It tastes really dry, making their food less than showstopping.

All their salad portion sizes are so seriously huge,
Piled high with extra toppings, their chef is far from a scrooge!

I wish they used some spinach as a main salad filler,
But Instead they use iceberg lettuce and it's such a salad killer. 

Everything on their dinner menu is priced just about right,
But make sure to try their lunch menu if your wallet is tight.

Their restaurant atmosphere is very cheesy and fun,
It exudes cute pizzeria characteristics that are nicely done.

It's just too bad that their interior is so small,
Patrons look uncomfortably cramped and that's no fun at all.

Oreganos is mediocre just middle of the road,
Don't eat too much of their monster sized portions or you might explode!

Their dishes are too large for me I never eat it all, 
but with their charming restaurant atmosphere I always have a ball."}
{"text":"One of my go tos in Gilbert,AZ. I get take out a lot but sometimes I sit down when I'm with family. I have tried almost every single pasta dish. My favorites are the Big Rig and Alfredo  the dark. I also never leave without getting a garlic cheese bread. It comes out on a huge double loaf of bread and ALWAYS gets demolished quickly."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love this place! The portions are huge, the prices fair, the waitstaff is always so nice and accommodating! We love sitting at the bar, it's fast amazing service! Annie waited on us and even though she was busy we still had great service! We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was in college. This is a place to veg out and carb load. The portions are huge and everything is homemade. We have tried most things on the menu but my favorites are Tony's guacamole and the artichoke lasagna. The Caesar salad is really good as well. They serve my favorite dessert the pizza cookie. It's a half baked cookie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate chips. We have always had great service.

The issue with this place used to be the wait. However, you can now check in on yelp and get on the wait list."}
{"text":"Have been going to Oreganos for years. This one doesn't seem to have it together. Tried to serve our \"appetizer\" after our the main meal was served. Couldn't wait to take our order and get us out of here. Food was ok but not up to normal. Disappointed in the last few visits at this location."}
{"text":"Amazing service from Kirra! She was really personable and super patient as we could not decide what we wanted to eat! I'll come back again and ask to be in her section! As always food was great and you can never go wrong with the pazookie!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Quoted an hour for table took an hour an a half and that's only after I complained. Once seated took I have no idea long to get our drink order. Placed food order pretty much anything on the menu at least 40 minutes or more.  Brought out appetizers had to ask for silverware only to be told they have no clean silverware. Had to go hunt down our own napkins. SMH if you are short on staff please hire more. Not impressed at all"}
{"text":"My wife and i's favorite restaurant. All the oregano's have great food, but this particular location is our favorite , because of the people who work there. 
They are the best. Best service, best attitude, and best management."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this establishment, and always been treated with respect and kindness, great costumer service."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I absolutely HATE chain restaurants and I avoid them like the plague...The only reason why I started coming here was because they opened a new location within walking distance of my house and sometimes it's just convenient. With that being said, location alone is not enough to earn them my four star review, nor is it enough to keep me coming in as often as I do. 

The food will not blow you away, but it is still VERY good and it is VERY consistent. (And reasonably priced)The chefs may not be geniuses, but they are experts when it comes to cooking the food that Oregano's offers. I've never ordered something and had it come out not the way I expected. (With the exception of having my calamari come out way too greasy on TWO occasions, but when you order something 4-6 times a month for over a year, you have to expect some mistakes)

As mentioned above, I come in quiet often...so often, in fact,  that I'm on a first name basis with the bartenders and some of the wait staff. The restaurant is going to be (very) busy regardless of what night you go in. Expect a long wait and expect your server to be very busy...Where they may lack in time, for the most part, they make up for it in kindness. (sometimes their kindness borderlines \"cheesey\", but that's neither here nor there) I've learned to bypass this wait, by heading straight to the bar area. Even on the busiest nights I can usually find a pair of seats...

Like I Said, the food is very good...I get the fried calamari every single time I go in and in my opinion, it is some of the best I've ever had. Tender and crispy without being too heavy. (Ask for a side of the lime Parmesan wing sauce for dipping along with the marinara it comes with) My other favorite appetizer is the Holy Guacamole'...If you're a Guac fan, I promise you will not be disappointed. 

I've had everything on this menu and there's nothing I don't like...The wings are drumsticks only, sauced perfectly. The pizzas, each variety, are great and all of the pasta dishes will leave you satisfied. (Not blown away, but definitely satisfied) 

I will say that the lasagna was better before when they'd bake it fresh, but it was an hour investment and you can barely tell the difference..."}
{"text":"Great pizza - but there's always a long wait for dinner and they don't make reservations."}
{"text":"Oreganos offers a very home-like atmosphere and a wide selection of delicious Italian foods. After watching an episode of Sopranos and craving pasta with meatballs, Oreganos was able to satisfy my desires with an endless bowl of pasta and meat sauce for $7 (2 meatballs were an extra $3.29 but they were delicious). I also got a pizza there and they offer various Chicago-style pizzas from thin crust to pan. The pizza does take about half an hour because it's made fresh, but definitely worth the wait. Overall the food was delicious and me and my girlfriend got full and had a ton of pizza leftover, and best part was we only spent 25! The service was average, but everyone was pretty nice there. I would definitely recommend Oreganos to anyone wanting a hearty Italian-style dinner. 
Oh, try and go a little earlier (around 5-530ish) to avoid the wait which can be very long on certain days as Oreganos is definitely a hot-spot in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I love this place! 

My favorites are the white pizza and the chicken lasagna, which I'm such a fan of I hadn't taken a chance at trying their other dishes. Until today. The deep dish made me nostalgic of my native Midwest. The Pesto Penne was perfectly paired with its bread bowl. The calamari although fried, tasted fresh. 

The staff is friendly and it is a warm, inviting atmosphere as an added bonus. 

I discovered them when I first moved into town and ate from a catered lunch, catered for a several dozen employees. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, considering the volume of food made at one time.

Their cheap kids meals are always an added bonus.

What more can I say?"}
{"text":"Pizza is pizza is pizza is pizza, right? And all Oregano's are the same, right?

Not always the case. There is shitty pizza, and then there is good pizza. Oregano's falls under the good pizza category. And yes, the quality of the food is pretty much the same at each location, there are certain things that make this location stand out from say, the old town location.

Like easy parking. Getting a seat within 15 minutes. An abundance of outdoor seating (Old town has outdoor seating too, but Shea has more). Managers that come around to each table to make sure everything is cool.

Little things that make everything stand out.

Not all pizza is created equal. And for that matter, neither are Oregano's."}
{"text":"I have been here many times before. Yesterday, I brought my mom who lives out of state. She said this was the best pizza she's ever had. We also had the pizza cookie--if you haven't had this it is a must try. So good! Our service was impeccable. Thanks to Jerry, we had an even better time than expected. He was quick, served us our pizza, was extremely helpful with recommendations. He also took time to show us a catering menu. My mom said yesterday was her favorite meal and time we had."}
{"text":"The yelp check in is the biggest joke. It one does not move your wait time up in anyway. It is a waste of time. Had to wait over an hour for a wait time estimated for 28 minutes."}
{"text":"Had a pizza and some beers. Also tried the D'licious Root Beer Float. It was tasty but the alcohol level was low. Chose the tall blue moon instead which did the trick. Had Fried Zucchini with ranch and that was good. Lots of choices on the menu to work with. The service was great and real friendly. Would love to come back here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Oregano's. I have frequented at least 3 others. 

The girl who checks me in knows me by name, and the waitresses always come around to offer drinks while you're waiting (something other Oregano's are not as good at). 

I always start with a Pablo Picasso salad, which I have never had a problem with (probably ordered at least 20 of them by now). Never old salad ingredients- always fresh!  My husband loves the calamari. Only once did someone complain about an appetizer- it was our last visit and my mother-in-law and her brother said the Quacatoni (sp) was too salty- but I loved it and thought it was like usual. 

The pizza (pan!) is to die for, and the drinks are always made strong. Additionally, a group of 6-8 people always only spend around $120-140, including multiple drinks and appetizers. How could you beat that???

Of course the wait times (never less than 30 minutes and up to 70 minutes during busy times) made me want to give it 4 stars- I really wish they took reservations- but there's a reason why they're so busy! I usually try to go before or after the 6-8pm rush. The waiting staff (at this location specifically) has ALWAYS been fantastic. I am a frequent Oregano's eater (1x a month) and this location's service is above others. 

Overall: Worth the wait, great service, food, and prices."}
{"text":"Really great food and good service. Staff is very nice and helpful. I have always had good service at this location. Lots of thanks to the manager for running such a wonderful establishment."}
{"text":"Great service by the staff and amazing food! My family and I have been going here for years and we absolutely love this place. Be prepaired to wait awhile though ;)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Oregano's before but not this location. I will never return! It took 2 hours to get a pizza! The service was horrible. We ordered drinks and the waitress came back 2 times in 20 to take our food order but didn't bring our drinks until we asked again. After placing our order we didn't see her again unless we went looking for her. We had to go to the bar to get water. The bread on my sandwich looked like it wasn't cooked. We could have gone to NYPD pizza next door and probably been in and out. Because of the slow service we did not make a deadline we didn't to make. We should have walked out but we kept thinking the food would come soon."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local restaurants here in Arizona! I have ordered something different every time I've gone and loved everything I have tried. The REAL reason my boyfriend and I go there is for the infamous pazookie. The only downfall is expect a long line almost any time you go. Its a popular place."}
{"text":"So to start out I'm told it would be a 1:45 wait for a carry-out pizza. Wow. I know they are busy, but this isn't Friday or Saturday night, or Super Bowl Sunday--it was 4:00 on a a Thursday. Next bombshell, the price. $24.50 for a 12\" pan pizza. What? Is it topped with caviar or does it come in a box lined with felt and gold inlays? Of course not. So that's 2 strikes already. This had better be one good pizza.
Unfortunately, it was just average. The crust was described on their website as light and flaky. But I would best describe the majority of the crust as sponge-like and heavy. And the exposed edge was hard & crunchy. The toppings were also very light, hard to tell because they put the cheese on the top, but I pulled off the layer in a few spots and found the toppings quite sparse. And canned mushrooms. That's terrible. 
In summary, an almost 2 hour wait, way over-priced, and average at best. That equals two stars."}
{"text":"We have gone to Oregano's several times since moving here two months ago.  We LOVE the think crust pizza and huge salads. The service has always been excellent and fast.  The atmosphere is appealing, but a bit too much noisy music in the background.  It is a little hard to carry on a conversation.  Overall, we would recommend this restaurant to anyone-the earlier in the evening the better."}
{"text":"Had an excellent lunch for a great price.  Our server, Anna was excellent.  Out order came out perfect and quickly.  The atmosphere is also great.  Veronica assisted Anna and was also very friendly and efficient.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Oreganos is one of my favourite places to eat.  I have eaten at pretty much all of the locations and love them.  I have had good luck too as far as the food is concerned also.  I think only two times we had issues.  

Now for this trip to this location.  We spent most of the afternoon purchasing a new car. We were hungry and this place was on the way home.  Knowing the good reputation for Oreganos we stopped by for some solid pizza.

This is how it went good for me and bad for the better half.  We got there and there was a wait of about 10 - 20 minutes.  We ordered a deep dish sausage and peperoni.  I asked if would be okay to have a stuff tonight.  She said no because she does not like stuffed.  I said okay put the order in.  We sit down order some yummy meatballs while we wait.  Then the pizza comes and it looks different.  She said this is different here.  They brought us a stuffed pizza and I am like hell yea.  She was like hell no.  Something happen and the hostess did a stuffed.  I did not care what happen because I prefer stuffed over deep.  I was in heaven.  The pizza was really good and yummy.  I ate just 1 1/2 slices and took the rest home.  It was good.  I will have the other slices tonight.  

Like I said this place is really good.  You should try it."}
{"text":"This would have been 5 stars.... if our food was not cold. Our server was awesome and handled everything thing professionally. The manager was amazing as well and because of excellent service there will be a second visit."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for a some years. I must say I am pleased with my order I had the meat lasagna it was very good I must say it came with a lot of me and the cheesy garlic bread is delicious. I will be checking this place out again I definitely got a list of things that I want to try and I am glad that it is one around the corner from my house but I do miss sugar daddy's that used to be there before Oregano's"}
{"text":"Wow.  I have wanted to try this place for a long while.  It definitely good.  I wish the prices were much less.... However the server and every employee we encountered were so nice and attentive. 
The alfredo, artichoke lasagna was very good.  I wish it had way for alfredo sauce on it.
Hubby tried his usual chicken parma. He said it was decent. Noodles were cooked perfect for him and the sauce was good.
Kids had pizza which they liked a lot, and tortellini. I tried a tortellini,  nothing special.  I thought they were bland and watery with not enough filling.
Neat selections and combinations of flavor. 
The staff and service really win it for them though. I feel that's really what you're paying for. The food is good but not spectacular."}
{"text":"I hope my second visit is better than my first. this place has a lot of potential. it's a very cute restaurant and very nicely decorated. since it is brand new it makes sense why it's a little messy but I think the managers are doing a fantastic job with the new place!! 
my server, Michael, was not the greatest. taking 6 minutes to even greet us was the first mistake. if I were to write my review solely on his performance, I would give it a 2. 
I got a pan pizza and it wasn't my favorite but that's because I didn't really understand what it was before I ordered it. I definitely want to come back and try the thin crust! the girls next to us ordered that and they seemed to really enjoy it! 
every other worker greeted me and my friend with friendly smiles and made me feel very welcome! definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Huge Menu, Friendly People, Good Food.  I really like oregano's for their wide selection.  I took my date here in lieu of cooking (unfortunate bill issues left me with no gas for a few days) and she ordered the ravioli and I got the BBQ chicken thin crust pizza.  It was really flavorful and I enjoyed it.  The only downside (which cost them that fabled 5 stars) was the fact that it is strictly call ahead seating.  This place gets BUSY... and when it gets busy the wait can be pretty bad because all of their food is made from scratch (you can taste it).  Other than that... fantastic meal and get the desert cookie thing they have.  SOOO Good!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now since visiting and it is seriously the best pizza I've ever had. 

We got the Número One-O pizza - absolutely amazing. Seriously. I used to never like sausage on pizza and the Italian sausage they use is awesome!!

I also got the Big Old Fashioned Greyhound (vodka and grapefruit juice). Yummo!"}
{"text":"First time to Oregano's.  We'll be back.  Extensive menu.   We chose pizza and it was delish!   Music a little too loud but we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Everything here is BIG!  I've had almost everything on the menu over the years and my go to is the Big Rig pasta dish with chicken (shredded, it's delicious).


Known for their Pizza but in my opinion the pasta dishes are the best choice here.  Pizookie is a must have, save room!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me 4,762 visits to this Oregano's to finally get my lazy ass to type out a review of this place.  Perhaps it's the overall indifference, and everyday-ness quality to this place that explains.   

FOOD --- 3 stars
SERVICE --- 3.5 stars
ATMOSPHERE --- 4 stars
PARKING --- 1 star

Oregano's isn't bad nor terribly good --- but it falls in the middle as an average lunch or dinner option.  Portions here are big, but quanity does not equal quality.  I find it to be infinitely better than most other Italian chains (the BARFY Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill and Carrabba's), but not quite at the level of Maggiano's or Il Fornaio.  

The food here is OK, although there are a few standouts. 
* Alfredo the Dark pasta with the poblano peppers.  
* Lady is a Scampi pasta
* Pizza Cookie (or whatever it's called)
* Italian Fried Potatoes

Btw, that last item is their cutesy name for waffle fries.  Being the waffle fry whore that I am, I have to say these are quite good. 

The baked sandwiches are OK --- the beefstro and stuffed turkey being one of my usual orders.  The pizza is OK as well.  Being a thin crust lover, I find the crust at Pizza Heaven and Pizzeria Bianco to have a better-tasting texture.  It's almost a little too thin (read: cheap) here.  Kind of like notebook paper.  How do I know?  Because I've tried it.  The salads here are big, so be warned.  Can't comment on the taste though because I haven't had them.

The 1950s swing/jazz motif, tomato sauce cans, and loud t-shirts can be charming in a campy kind of way. But what I like most about this location is how they preserved the \"Damen/Herren\" bathroom signs from when it used to be some kind of Bavarian wonderland.  

Among the cons here are the parking NIGHTMARE and sometimes hellish 1 hour-plus waits (on Mondays even!).  This place is ALWAYS packed.  I do not understand why there are only 15 parking spots here for a restaurant that easily seats over 100.  They must expect all their customers to carpool together in mini-vans.  But even so, they should know that NO ONE in Central Phoenix would be caught dead in a mini-van.

The parking shortage has caused nearby businesses to post bitchy signage warning Oregano's patrons not to park there - resulting in the traffic BOOBYTRAP that is 10th St.  Drivers must dodge slowly moving cars and waddling Oregano's customers weave in and out as the tiny parking lot leaks out onto 10th.  

Staff here is always quick and freakishly friendly and cheery -- kind of like the drones at Jamba Juice and Cold Stone Creamery.  It's kind of cute, but borderline annoying that it seems trite.  But there are plenty of a-holes at other restaurants so I'm not complaining.

So there you have it.  Not exactly great, but I will be back soon.  Visit 4,763 is coming up next week.

P.S.  For stalkers who care, Phoenix Fire Department DOES eat here often.  In fact when Melinda sees a fire engine parked outside she always requests a table close to the firefighters.  She thinks those guys are \"en fuego.\""}
{"text":"While the food may be good, their honesty policy and goodwill are lacking!! Their local franchise manager agreed to a discount for our group members visiting for the weekend, but only after all of our visitors ordered and paid did they learn the corporate office would not honor the agreed upon discount! Very foolish business practice! Won't be back and don't recommend that you should either!!!"}
{"text":"The food is very delicious no complaint. But to me i feel that reviews should have to do a lot with the customer service and atmosphere as well. Everytime i have gone to this place i feel a little overwhelmed with the loud people and over crowded! I also hate that the wait to get in and the wait to get your food is extremely long. I get super annoyed when the waiter or waitress forget about you too..."}
{"text":"For starters, I want to say I love oreganoes. Its close to my house and the food is always awesome, which is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars. Came in last night with the table of four. Put my name on the waitlist and waited for an hour for a table. It was my brother's birthday and I asked the hostess to tell our server to bring out two pizookies for his birthday. I sit down at the table with an empty cocktail glass and still wait at least 10 minutes to be acknowledged. My server finally stops over and says are you waiting on three more and I said yes and proceeds to not come back for about 15 minutes until the other 2 in my party arrives. We don't get a Hi how are you? we get are you ready to to order?. We had to ask for water and said we needed another minute but he never even offered to refill my cocktail. When we ordered I had to ask for a glass of wine, which he had forgotten about for 20 minutes and I had to remind him. Food came out pretty quick  but he never even asked how it was. My boyfriend joined half way thru the meal and the server didnt come back until we were done with dinner. He had to ask to order a drink from the server, who didn't even offer me another glass of wine. Its about 945 at this time and hes nowhere to be seen- probably doing sidework so he can leave. He finally comes back and asks what kind of pazookies we wanted....which I had already told the hostess....so it could be a surprise, but nope! That was ruined too. He drops the check, and I tipped him a generous 15% considering the service. Comes back immediately to pick it up and takes all of our glassware to the bar to be cleaned but leaves our 3 stacks of dirty plates. I don't want to pull the card but I'm a restaurant manager and if I knew one of my servers gave such atrocious service, I'd fire them."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the stone cold greatest pizza I've ever enjoyed in my entire life. Unfortunately for me, I live 768 miles away. I ordered a Chicago style stuffed sausage pizza at the Gilbert, Arizona location, and I could die right now happy. Foodwise, this was the peak experience for me. It's all downhill from here. This is deathbed worthy. Let this be my last meal on earth when the time comes please. I ate three slices and I'm in a food coma. So good it should be illegal or for the rich only. I don't wanna leave this place. I will remember this for a long time to come. I had the great pleasure of being served by Emily. As lovely and pleasant as she is beautiful. What a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went there the other night with the EX, heard so much about the place from my daughter and from the crowd of people always waiting to get in so I thought I'd give it a shot. We didn't have to wait too long . I ordered a class of Merlot, it tasted old, sent it back and a new bottle was opened just for me. The appetitzers were fresh and delicious, just like I expected. The all you can eat pasta bowl ended after one serving for me ,it was huge, no complaints except the pasta was not cooked  aldente and it was luke warm, probably could have ate more if it was hot. The extra meat ball and sausage would have been better if simmered in the gravy (sauce) but I did not do the cooking. My ex's huge salad was full of prime steak and greens and she and I agreed (first time ever) that it was very flavorable. I finished it the next day for breakfast. Our waitress was fantastic,on the ball and very attentive. I will return again, order something different next time and probably have the ex with me (dutch of course)."}
{"text":"Good service, kind of a long wait but enjoyed our meals. Staff was friendly and helpful. Lasagna was very tasty. Happy to have oregano a on west side."}
{"text":"Second time here.  This time for my daughter's 16th birthday dinner....her choice.  She picked the appetizer, pizza, and dessert.  I have to say that our second trip to this establishment far surpassed our first.  

Our waiter was awesome and checked on us often, making sure our meal was correct and drinks were filled.  He even acknowledged my daughter's birthday in an appropriate way,  which was nice.

The Bruchetta was so good.  Our pizza was their version of the meat lovers w/thin crust.  My daughter's choice and everyone but me loved it.  I'm a pan pizza lover so it wasn't an issue of food quality,  just food preferences. When they say \"thin\", they mean cracker thin, lol.....but hey, it's healthier, right?!? He-he-he. Let's just say that there were no left overs to take home - it was that good! And a free birthday Pa'zookie for the birthday girl to round out the night......A home run, in our book."}
{"text":"omg, the grandma g's pizza with rosemary chicken and potatoes was soooo good! I came here with my parents and we also shared a mediterranean salad, which was also delicious. Tried the Four Peaks Kilt Lifter on draft and it was great. Seems hard to go wrong here. There was a huge line, but totally worth the wait.

Oh yeah, I got carded w/ my parents and I'm turning 31 in four months. lol! Apparently I look *way* young. YESSSSSS ;P"}
{"text":"First off the waiter and staff were extremely helpful and friendly! Secondly, their food is truly Chicago style. Having lived in IL most of my life this is the food I have dreams of and salivate thinking of for days on end. Great deep dish and thin crust pizza( yes we went over board and order way too much food)! Way worth it but please note portions are HUGE! HUGE! Pasta was amazing, meatballs, sauces everything on point. Their wings are magical we had the Italian gold my favorite and my fiancés fav the garlic lime! Again magic! Their salad was on point! The dressings are home-made in fact EVERYTHING is home-made there!! Go eat there. Go now! Why are you still reading this?!?"}
{"text":"This Oregano somehow stands out among all in the valley, may be for the ambience, locality and the wait staff.

All the wait staff recommendations on our first visit were awesome, no complaints, true to the taste as mentioned, very flavorful, and encouraged me to try them again.

This is as good as it gets. We sat outside in a nice weather, which was a plus point.

I would strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its reputation.  Our hostess had a bit of an attitude but our server was very friendly and helpful.  The pizza was delicious, the servings were large, and the prices were not bad at all.  Even though it was very hot and the only available seating was outside, our group had a great meal.  Definitely coming back here next time we're in Tempe."}
{"text":"The service was great! The pizza was great but what is wrong with the beer! Was warm & kind of flat, left a bad taste in our mouth?!"}
{"text":"Waiting.....So. Much. Waiting. Don't bring kids here and don't go if you have an hour to eat. You need 2 hours here. Service is so painstaking s-l-o-w. We have been here twice on Sunday evening - around 8pm. Never seen a manager or even an essence of a manager. It's weird. You walk in and the hostess will say - there will be a 20 minute wait and there are tables open?? I think this place is either under staffed or the manager is not lighting a fire under anyone's butts to get things moving. I knew the food would be great because Oregano's food is always great. WE WILL NOT BE BACK UNTIL WE HEAR SERVICE HAS IMPROVED. Move people! Stop standing around! The atmosphere will be more lively too, like the feisty,quick,fun Oregano's that I'm used to!"}
{"text":"Roasted Garlic Chicken Lasagna"}
{"text":"Questo posto è delizioso. 

Oregano's. Oregano's. Oregano's oh why do I love you so. This place is delicious just as the phrase above states for those who speak Italian. Don't get me wrong I don't speak Italian and I had to google translate that phrase but it had to be done. 

I have been dining at Oregano's for years and years. Actually as long as I have been living in the states. I moved here in 1993 from Europe and that is the same year that Oregano's opened its first location in old town Scottsdale. And since have grown to 14 locations across the valley. And the continued success and slow growth is to be noted because they maintain their quality.  Most restaurants that grow too fast lose the quality and their roots. Not Oregano's. 

Oregano's has a great atmosphere. Great decor. Awesome staff. Good drinks. And amazing food. For a pizza place you would think all that they would be great at is pizza right?  On the contrary they are good at everything. The Oregano's wings are my favorite. When I am in the mood for wings this is where I go. 

The pizza is always delicious and the pasta is stellar. And the greatest part is that they are so family friendly and oriented. Which is extremely important. 

There is always a wait for dinner. However I don't view this is a negative but rather a positive. If I have to wait to be seated than I know I am in a good and popular place.

I could go on and on but I will conclude the review by saying that I have never had a bad experience at any Oregano's location and based on that and the above mentioned reasons is why this restaurant gets 5 's from me. I will be a customer for life.  Keep up the good work Mark Russell."}
{"text":"After being a loyal customer of Oregano's for many years, I recently went for the first time to the restaurant on Bell. It was busy, which is no surprise. So we sat at the bar and ordered appetizers while waiting for our table. The bartender was great, personable and helpful. After a normal wait of about 20 minutes, we got a table. The waiter was slow and distracted. I ordered my favorite pizza (the O-Riva), which I've had more times than I can count. And for the first time, boy was I extremely disappointed!!! The crust was dry, tasted like it was from a box mix and the bottom was covered with a ton of flour. The sauce was bland and the toppings were very sparse. I'll go back to Oregano's but never to this location."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and do not understand where some people are coming from.  

If I go into a place and no one comes to my table or greets me with in the first five minutes.  I will get up and go grab someone to come take care of us.  It is terrible when I read reviews and the customer complain they waited for 20 minutes.  Where is the customers responsibility too in this?  

Then the other thing is that food is subjective and everyone has different taste.  Pizza is the biggest culprit too for this.  I do not like a certain pizzeria on 7st just south of Van Buren.  There are some people that think it is the greatest.  I like a pizzeria on central and camelback.  I love their deep dish and some of my friends do not.  I do not think it is fair when people pick apart a place because they do not like the taste. 

Now time for the review.  We stopped by here for a early mothers day celebration after watching Guardians of the Galaxy (which was great by the way).  We ordered two thin crust pizzas one with cheese only and cheese and sausage.  The pizzas were great.  There were three salads ordered also.  The women loved them too.  One salad was the Picaso.  The other was a Mediterranean salad.  I am not sure what the third was.   There was a lasagna that was ordered too.  The report on the lasagna was a A plus.  We also ordered the sausage appetizer too and they did not last long.  I ordered the pasta that was in a bread boule and had pesto sauce on it and sausage in it.  It was good.  My mother and family had a really good time.  They all enjoyed their food and that was important to me.  The server did a great job and that was reflected in his generous tip too.  

The only knock is the area we sat was loud.  I have trouble hearing and had to listen hard to the people at the table.  The server caught on and did a great job of speaking up for me.  

Great place and I like it and will be back."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  I love the deep dish pizza a lot.  We always sit at the bar when Ben is working.  He does a great job and is really fun to talk too.  This trip we ordered the side of Italian sausage and a deep dish half peperoni and all sausage.  The pizza did not disappoint at all.  This place is really good and you should give it a try.  The Italian side sausage is tasty.  The deep dish does take some time to make also."}
{"text":"I'm a little hesitant to write a review on such a heavily reviewed/chain restaurant like this.  However, I really like it, so I thought I should share why.

I have eaten at Oregano's many times since moving to Arizona, heck I ate there several times while visiting.  Their Pizza is fresh and very good, (my fiancee loves their Pizza, but she likes the thin cracker like crust.... hors d'oeuvres come on crackers, not entrees!), anyway personal preference aside, it is a good pizza.

It is their Italian dishes that I really like, I usually start with an order of their cheese bread, although nothing really fancy there, they do send out half of a french roll sliced long-ways and loaded with cheese, garlic salt and a side a their house made marinara sauce, it's always delicious.  

If you like sausage... and the time I spent in Germany has made me quite the sausage snob.... you really should try the Italian sausage sandwich, they make the sausage daily and serve it until they run out of sausage, it is served on a roll with mozzarella melted over it and topped with grilled peppers and onions.  I always get the large, and take half of it home for lunch later in the week!!  

Also their Lasagna is great (be ready to wait for it, they make it to order so it can take up to 45 minutes!), I had a Chicken and pesto pasta in a bread bowl last time I was there, and that was excellent as well, always solid food at Oregano's.

As far as decor, I have taken people there for business meeting lunches, I have dropped in with a group of friends around a table, and I do lunch dates with my Fiancee there.  It may not be the place to take someone if you wish to wine and dine them, however for a casual place that is affordable and you know you will get good food (and a lot of it) then Oregano's is a great place for you."}
{"text":"I have gone to many of the Oregano's around the valley, all of them provide a very consistent experience and that's why I like to take friends, family, and business associates there. The location on Elliott does not provide the same experience! On three occasions now the salads have had way too much dressing, even when one of the people I was dining with asked for less dressing on her main course chicken cesar salad after seeing what we got on our salads there was two maybe three times the amount of dressing that is on any other salad from other locations! So, you need to work on that big time! Now the second problem, the pizza at this location is not the same! The dough on the pizza does not taste the same and there for the pizza does not taste the same! And to top it if they undercook the pizza! So what you end up with is a pizza that tastes like something I tried to make at home! Doh! That's why I go out for pizza! 
Please please! Get some upper management in this location, fast! If not, Oregano's is going down hill!"}
{"text":"I had Brendon tonight as my server, i am glad I had him he is great at his job! All of the cooks,dishwashers and host who help in attending us in any way  where awesome tonight and i will be back soon for more!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Wait time here is horrible!! Have to wait to be seated which feels like forever but to be exact 45 minutes. We sat down, ordered our appetizer that took forever to prepare, waited about 30 minutes. Then waited some more for our main order, took about 30 more minutes. In between our wait, we had to stop our waiter to refill our drinks. Our second visit was no different. Don't plan on going back in a long time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  

I won't go into detail, cuz there's plenty of reviews about how good the food is.  The only reason I give it 4 stars, instead of 5 is the price is a bit steep for pizza, and getting a seat requires some patience.  But then again, it's not Pizza Hut.  Place is very busy plan on a 45 minute to hour wait on weekends....but worth it.  

I usually now go in for lunch where you get a giant slice for 3.99...either way, the food is great, albeit a tad pricy...."}
{"text":"There are quite a few of these across AZ from Cave Creek to Tucson. The food is very consistent. They update the menu's with different items from time to time, so they keep on giving you a reason to come back. Very smart. 

I've never had a bad meal here, and I've gone A LOT. Something that can only be conveyed in ALL CAPS. :) The portions are big, especially if you order their big salad size. I'm partial to the \"Pablo Picasso\" salad. For a little over $10, you get a sizable portion that is hard to finish in one sitting. The \"Oregano's Favorite\" and \"Vino Bambino\" are delicious, and with so many choices, you can satisfy your tastebuds , almost as much as with a pizza, but with something not known for being characteristically satiating.

I would be remiss to not mention the pizza. I've had their thin crust, and I have had their deep dish Chicago Style, and they are all excellent. You can expect this excellence each time you visit. I'm sure everyone has their preference on pizza, but there is a reason this place isn't a delivery oriented grease box. Its on the more opposite end of the spectrum along with other quality pizza purveyors."}
{"text":"Just fair tasting pasta and salad.  The balsamic dressing is what saved the lunch this day."}
{"text":"The staff was amazing I must say.  We've been wanting to try this place since opening day but always looked very busy.  Our wait time was only about 30 minutes. It's a beautiful building, just not sure why in AZ especially they wouldn't have built room inside to wait for a table. Our waiter was outstanding. I wish all restaurants had service like his. The food really wasn't anything great. I was looking forward to this amazing meal with all the customers I see daily flooding the place, but no, not great.  My salad was pretty much a head of iceberg lettuce with a few \"homemade\" croutons that were just dried out garlic bread, a little chicken, and a pinch of cheese. I ate about half then gave up on it.  Pizza was a thin crust that didn't have much flavor.  My husband's lasagne was very good he said, not the greatest, but good. Was a pretty small portion he pointed out. My girls liked their fettuccine but just left the leftovers behind. I don't see us eating there again."}
{"text":"It was the first time to any Oregano's restaurant.  Everybody in our party of 5 enjoyed their food.  One pasta, two pizzas, one mac and cheese, and one salad.  The wait staff was excellent, and we were happily surprised with only a 10-minute wait.  The snowbirds have obviously flown.  We sat on the patio, and it was perfect."}
{"text":"The food is excellent.... service is friendly.... atmosphere is pleasant. Oh, and drinks are eeeeeexcellent.... :)

I would recommend going during the \"off\" hours. Like maybe 2pm on a Sunday when you can get seated quickly. Otherwise the line is out the door and halfway down the block.

Love their food.... but I don't understand the hype.... and I certainly would not wait an hour or two to be seated."}
{"text":"Hey, if you feel like waiting an hour and a half to be seated after being told it would be a 40 minute wait, and want to wait another hour for your food to be given to you, I've got the place for you... We got there around 7 and didn't get the opportunity to leave until about 11. Absolutely terrible customer service. Silverware is dirty, and they never bothered to bring an appetizer that was ordered. Don't bother.

Oh, but the food is decent."}
{"text":"Great pizza serve was slow and food was timely. Went after the spring training game so it was packed. Well worth it"}
{"text":"I was going to give it a four stars because the pizza wa good, but I am very disappointed with the dessert.  We ordered the chip cookie pizza and it was half baked and could not eat it. We told the waiter that we didn't like it, and he simply said \"this is how it is supposed to be, half baked\". I said that I didn't like it and if I could a well baked one and just say \"sorry this is how it done\" and walked away.

I will never returned here."}
{"text":"So my daughter and I just had lunch here today and I order the Chicken kale salad, which I normally love at other locations. I start to eat the salad and find a big piece of plastic in the middle of the salad. I call the waitress over and she says oh my and comes back and says the boss will be over soon, I say alright  and she asks if I want another salad and I said of course. 

Well my salad comes and I eat some, ask for a to go box and she brings the check and says the boss is too busy to come over so I will tell him thank you! We look at each other and say \"thank you\"???? I look at the check thinking she took it off the bill and no she did not!!!! I have never been to a restaurant where if something like that happened that they didn't take it off the bill. To what do I owe the boss a thank you for? Bringing me a salad with no plastic, geez thanks!!!! Also very light  on the croutons at this location and they are the best!

I will be honest I have been to this location 5-6 times and every time there seems to be a problem with something with the quests I have been with. I can say I will NOT go back to this location again!!!!! To top it off I got a stomach ache as soon as I got to the parking lot!

I was very very disappointed with my lunch and with Oregano's!!!"}
{"text":"I spilled sauce all over my yellow dress and brand new cream-colored lined coat and am still giving this place four stars:-)
I'm a sucker for some vintage rat-pack, Italian-50s ish themed decor and yummy food.  Everything here is served family style while you listen to the vintage tunes linger in the air and garlic waft about your nose.  
Pazookie.  That word alone is enough to get you there, right?  It's a cookie half-baked in a skillet and served with mounds of ice cream - all melty, ooey, gooey goodness brought right to your table.  Mmm.
I tend to get a little...hmm...well...you've seen those Snickers commercials right?  That's me...I'm some lunatic when my blood sugar is low and then my friends have been known to say \"She's back\" once I've been fed.  Our poor waitress had to be so patient and kind with me while I ordered because I wasn't making a whole lot of sense and then she was perceptive enough to tell me one of the dishes I was considering would take substantially longer to cook than the other.  Bless her!  
The drink glasses are also HUUUUGE!  This may have been the one time I regretted not ordering a soda - big always looks more delicious to me.  
We thought the prices were a little steep when we were looking over the menu, but then all five of us ate until we were going to pop and we still got two more meals out of the leftovers.  Can I get an Amen?  Seriously.  Loved it.  Some of the pasta could have used more sauce, but that was really the only complaint.  The ranch dressing is Kick-A.  

Our friend took us here during our Phoenix vacation and said it was a local favorite.  Yes, indeed!  If I ever hit up Phoenix again I am absolutely making sure Oregano's is on the agenda!"}
{"text":"This place really is great!  The atmosphere, overall, is just right (for a pizza/pasta/salad place). The outdoor seating is also great, and there's plenty of bar seating that is outside and 'close to outside' (something very desirable in Scottsdale!).  

The pizza is truly great (though NOT QUITE as good as 'Sauce' !). The staff are friendly and efficient, and the price is right.  Everything I've ordered here has been great."}
{"text":"Well you definitely won't leave hungry! Huge portions!  Kids loved the pizza and pasta and we had huge salads. The service was great and loved the decor ."}
{"text":"Still a regular here!  Probably at Oregano's at least once a week and it continues to impress.  The portion sizes are quite a bit smaller than they used to be (especially the sandwiches) but the prices have remained pretty consistent over the last 4 years I've been going.  My only complaint is that they switched the soda provider about 1.5 years ago and they went from these super fun giant cups to regular sized cups for drinks about 9-10 months ago.

Current favorites:  The pizza, still, guacatony, wings, and anything with the shaved ribeye in it!"}
{"text":"We're so glad to here that this location was opening! This was my first time eating at any oreganos locations and I must say the food is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! I had a salad and it was massive! Family potions for sure. The only reason I give it a 4 is because it has taken about an hour and a half each time and they don't take reservations"}
{"text":"I live by here. This is my neighborhood Oregano's and it's the place that has put me off going to Oregano's as a chain. Just a chain of multiple bleah experience coupled with the kicker that made me stop coming here.

Small bad experiences
1) I order the Bollo Pasta. The noodles are literally mush. I ask for one that is less overcooked. This dish the noodles are literally almost a soup. I ask what they can do? They bring me another bowl. Come on. 2 mush bowls and you don't comp or do something better.

2) We had a group of 6 people - they don't seat us because all 6 aren't there. 5 of us are. They tell us to wait in the bar and once the last person in our group shows they'll seat us at a booth. A group of TWO people show up and because they are only 2, they seat them in the booth. Mind you with the 5 of us I said why can't we just be seated and last person can just squeeze in cuz there's room. Nope EVERYONE has to be there. 10 minutes after they seat those 2 people, 2 more people join them. So clearly you LIE to get seating here. Meanwhile we waited almost an hour.

And the final straw.

I order a chicken pizza. I take a bite and immediately notice something hard. It's an inch long chicken bone SLIVER. A BONE SLIVER. If I had swallowed I probably could've died. I tell the server and manager. What do they do? Comp my meal? No.

They offer me a free pizookie.

What. the. Hell. I didn't even order a pizookie. How is that a resolution.

So while Oregano's may want to legalize marinara or whatever b.s. slogan they have. I say Legalize Competency."}
{"text":"We were driving through town on the way home to Cali and stopped to meet local friends here. It was their first time visiting this place too and they had heard it was good. We waited about 20-30 minutes to get seated and ordered two pan pizzas and two salads. The waiter informed us that the pan pizzas would take 45 minutes. I wanted to change my order but the others agreed to the wait. We ordered salad and calamari as appetizers. The calamari was just ok. I've had worse but I wouldn't order it again. The salads were also just ok. Chopped up lettuce and a couple tomatoes in mine and a slice of green onions. The blue cheese dressing was good though! Our pizzas finally came out and again they were just mediocre. I had the Grandma's rosemary and chicken potato. There was tons of cheese on it which kindof overpowered the taste. Also, there were two paper slices that probably came off the cheese slices inside our pizza. It was kind of gross picking out the paper. The crust was not my favorite but looking at other people's thin crust made me happy about my choice I guess. The thin crust looked like a tortilla it was so thin. Anyways, next time I drive through the phoenix area, I would stop anywhere except here."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place?  This is always a favorite of our family to go to when celebrating a special occasion.  We haven't had a bad meal, or drink, here yet.

First off, you have to try their house margarita.  There are unique (a splash of beer is added at the end when they make it), potent, and very good.

The Big Beefstro Salad is a great start to a meal.  Tender slices of warm beef mixed in with greens, diced jalapenos, cheese, caramelized onions, and dressing makes this a great salad with a little heat.

To my surprise, the wings were really good.  All of the wings were drummies.  They were deep fried and very meaty.  All of them had a nice crisp to them.  I got the Italian Gold ones.  It is a honey mustard, BBQ sauce.  Besides BBQ, this my second favorite wing sauce now.  

The Chicago-style pizza is also a must have.  Make sure you order it in the beginning because it takes time for it to cook.  But the time to cook it is all worthwhile in the end.  It's the best Chicago deep-dish style pizza I have had in the Phoenix area.

Lastly, you can't go wrong with the pizza cookie for dessert.  The cookie dough is gooey and warm.  The cold of the ice cream compliments it perfectly.  A must have.

Combine all of these with pleasant servers in a great setting and you have a great place to unwind after a long week or to celebrate something special."}
{"text":"Service is not at all good. Server is rude. Drinks remained empty until we asked for re-fills. When we asked if we could have shrimp and chicken in our entrée we were told it would be $8.99 to add. It's the way we were told as if we couldn't afford it. We received our appetizer with our meal instead of before. Rude customer service it will reflect on your tip"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here with all the bad reviews but our experience went surprisingly well.  The wait was as long as the hostess told us it was going to be - 45 min.  We got seated and everything went pretty smoothly.  The food was like the other Oregano's I've been to.  The only thing that was different is my 4 year old usually gets dough to play with but they didn't give that to her here.  A little disappointing.  I also felt like our waitress was giving my husband and brother a lot of attention but I kind of felt left out.  Maybe I was seeing things that day."}
{"text":"It was about 7:45 PM and my girlfriend and I sat at the bar to share a small dinner, since the restaurant was busy. We were promptly greeted by David and he took our order. Our experience at the bar was going well, as it usually does every time we visit. All of a sudden, David told us and the people sitting to our left, that he was buying us pizookie cookie desserts! We were shocked! He said that we were his most polite customers that entire day so he wanted to express his gratitude. This experience made our night and we hope David gets recognized for his kind gesture! Give this man a raise!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizzas we still haven't eaten in the restaurant but have ordered takeout several times and the food is amazing and takeout service is great.  The sodas while waiting are much appreciated."}
{"text":"So this evening we wound up at the bar area for dinner due to glitch in reservation link. The food was good,and bartender pleasant but bar is near the door so it was a tad hot. Drinks were on my other half ,so I can't complain. Overall we love this place. Tasty, generous portions and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We love Oregano's, we're from Chicago and it's always a must stop restaurant for us. This particular time we had 9 people in our party and waited about an hour for a table. Once we had a table the meal flowed smoothly. The only hiccup was that our pizza was made incorrectly, but our server resolved quickly. 

Macadamia nut pazooki is where it's at."}
{"text":"One of the things I love about this place is the outdoor seating in the cooler months.  I also love the Bellini, Toasted Ravioli, and Rosemary-Chicken Pizza.

There IS room for improvement, however.  The takeout \"system\" they are using has caused me to go somewhere else more than once.  I don't think that having certain pickup \"windows\" for loyal customers is a sufficient way to reward them, especially at that price point.

Oregano's, you have a LOT of good competition (especially in Central Phoenix) so you may want to rethink the way you are treating customers.  I'm going to try you out again soon so we'll see how things go from there."}
{"text":"I've been to Oreganos and I'm not sure why I keep coming back... oh yeah.. the Bellinis and the pazookie! 

The food is so-so and the food takes FOREVER. While their menus and servers give you fair warning that because they make everything from scratch that it takes longer to make. However, I know that its just a marketing ploy. The longer they make you wait (by telling you that perfection just takes time) the more you'll want it. By the time the food makes it to you, you're starving. At that point, everything tastes good, right?

Off the appetizer list, I have tried:
- the Guaca-Tony = fresh guac and pizza bread with WAY too much parm on them, also expect a 20 min wait
- the calamari = actually pretty decent, reminds me of mozzarella sticks though
- the garlic bread = wish the bread didn't come out of a plastic bag
- sweet potato fries = ok
- waffle fries = ok

Sandwiches
- italian sausage sandwich = spicy sausage, buy the jr size since the full size is too much, cheese looks fake and is not good if you have to reheat it the next day
- meatball sandwich = standard, no wow factor

Pizza = if you have about 90 minutes to wait, the pizza is pretty good. 

Have not tried any pasta but my friends have ordered it and it did not look amazing.

Bellini's = good strong mango/peach margarita

Pazookie= skip the food and just order one of these. It does take 20 minutes to make but you can choose between chocolate chip, white chocolate or peanut butter cookie. 

Service:
Slow. I'm not sure how many tables each server is assigned to but not only did we have to wait for our food, we waited for drinks to be refilled, waited for the server to bring us a box and waited for the bill. If you can't tell by now, lots of waiting."}
{"text":"My past visits at the cactus and Tatum location, I've had phenomenal service. This incident has been quite the worst customer service I've ever had from the waiter Jesus. When we first sat down outside on the patio seating, he said he'll be our server and he'll be back to take our order. At the time he had a few tables so we weren't impatient. After he finally comes to take our orders for drinks, it was long enough for us to go over the whole menu and we were ready to order. So we placed some orders and was still indecisive on the entres so we placed what we knew we wanted. It took about 10 to 15 minutes to get our drinks served to us, then as more to me went on I had to ask where our salad was. Finally after another 5 to 10 minutes he gave us our food. Next thing you know when we wanted to ask for cheese for the salad he was no where to be found. When he wasn't paying all of his attention to the table with five guys right next to us I finally got his attention to get some cheese for our salads. We were enjoying our meal, and I noticed there was a bug crawling in my beer. When I got his attention, He somehow copped an attitude with us. I ordered a \"bigger\" blue moon and drank 1/3 of the beverage. He said well since you drank \"this much\" I'll fill it back up to here okay? Than walked off. I was stunned he even said that. So I waited for the beer. He returned with a pint glass instead. No apologies, no sincerity, nothing. So the bill comes around and he charge me for the \"bigger\" glass. And I simply asked why was I charged when he returned with the pint. He argues with me and said you drank enough to put it in a pint glass. I stated that I didn't put the bug in my drink and I said I'd pay for the pint but not the bigger glass. Before this, normally when we're done with the meal we've always had servers pack our leftovers. He asked the two tables right next to us if he could pack their dinners. He left our boxes at our table and said I'll be back for the check. So not only did he argue with us, he didn't even provide the simple courtesy of packing our food. He was rude, never look at us or paid any attention. He was too worried about everyone except our table. If we ever even think about going back we will request a new server if we happen to get him again. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"How can you not enjoy Oregano's?  The service at this location is always great and friendly staff.  The seating is about as ample as it gets for an Oregano's and the fact that they are ALWAYS busy, says something, they are popular cause they are good.

I got the Junior Beefstro Salad, the bf got the chicken lasagna.  Both are amazing ( I had to sneak a bite of his).  

The portions are good size, and the price is right.  

There is just no way to go wrong."}
{"text":"My wife thinks this place is the best Pizza in the world! I think it is good pizza, so I am writing to tell you about it. Pizza is very subjective. My favorite kind of Pizza is New York style which is what Oregano's serves of course with a little extra flaked oregano in the cheese. This gives the pizza an original flavor. The salads are all very good and very big. The pasta dishes are great and again very big. You can't go wrong with a casual dinner or lunch out at any Oregano's location!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the chicken caesar salad here!! It is HUGE for under $10 - cannot be beat! I liked the seating at this location. We went on a Friday night and didn't have to wait long to be seated. We sat in the little \"house\" in the back, beyond the patio - very cutesy! Good service.  My only issue with this place is I really don't think I like anything else on the menu... Maybe I'm just a picky eater, but there's not too much variety."}
{"text":"Great food.  Ask for Andrew!
It was great service and good recommendations on selections."}
{"text":"Arrrgh!!! why do i keep coming back here???
i guess i should be asking the more poignant question: why is their food so effing good that i brave the elements and the parking and the waiting just to come here??? pizza is a dream, salads are heaven and the ice cream on a hot cookie is perfectly divine.
honestly, parking is a nightmare that even Freddy Kruger can't manipulate. no matter what time of the day it is, there is always at least a 10-minute wait. but folks, do not let these things deter you from fabulous pizza and rich dessert. i've braved the half hour wait, the cold, the rain and the heat to eat here.
Oreganos truly tests the patience of the patient-less but is well worth the stress."}
{"text":"The parking situation at this Oreganos is a bit better than their Tempe location, but is still a hassle. luckily, i lived walking distance from everything important in Scottsdale. the wait times are obscenely long as great pizza can't be rushed, but i feel like i can make a better push by calling ahead or coming in just before dinner-time (read: 3 or 4 o'clock). 
the roommate and i would come here often for a simple ice cream cookie dessert. i highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent food. The kids love to play with the pizza dough balls! Service is always top-notch and you absolutely want leftovers. I recommend the Pablo Picasso Salad, the best in the Southwest!"}
{"text":"The food is great. My husband had their home made pizza it takes an hour to cook so make sure you have plenty of time. The place is packed at dinner time so going mid day is ideal."}
{"text":"Food's closer to three and a half stars but that's alright.

The standard pizza is a thin crust style, I know I've seen someone expect something else every time I dine here. It's good, don't get me wrong, but I don't think everyone prefers thin crust over a standard crust.

The Chicago stuffed pizza is freaking huge, and it takes a while too! Considering there's a wait no matter what time I come, there's an option to order a stuffed pizza to cook while you wait. It's really nice because the pizza is ready as soon as we sit down!

I think the sweet potato fries are really good, slight hint of spices give a needed kick. Also the calamari's great. It's crispy but not oily.

And they have pizookies. I don't think anyone can really contest gooey cookie in a pan with ice cream on top.

Service is pretty friendly, but I don't think this restaurant is good at accommodating huge groups. The tables can't really take more than 6-8 at most, and they're either booths are round tables, not the kind you can squeeze together.

If your party is small and you crave Italian, nothing wrong with Oregano's."}
{"text":"Service is always very spotty here. Couple times we've received awesome service more often we receive less than stellar service. Food is ok, not great but not bad. Husband enjoys his penne bake."}
{"text":"Every time I have gone to Oregano's I try something different on the menu and everytime it's really good. I like sitting outside on a nice day"}
{"text":"Kinda corporate, kinda cheesy.  First time there so waitress didn't let us know that it was shared portions, but it was good. She was not entirely hospitable or impressive, must have been a bad day for her. :(   I had the scampi and I wasn't disappointed, only thing to complain about was the dryness, I wish there was a bit more sauce.  The garlic bread is delicious.  My son had the big something, he liked it.  It was spicy and delicious, but I forgot the name.  I probably would come here again, but there are too many other great hole in the wall Italian places to waste a second visit here."}
{"text":"Used this location for a private dinner, group of 20 & involved a business presentation . Great location, very easy to get to with a lot of parking available. 
Private room is a great size, has a projector and screen. Only complaint is that they have the screen mounted to the ceiling right in front of where they put their buffet set up. Makes it awkward for guests that want to go back for seconds during the presentation. Music from surrounding areas was a little loud by we managed. Friendly staff and food was awesome as always!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a local chain. BUT, this place is effing amazing.

Popped in for dinner last weekend. Waited about 10 minutes for a table (got one outside...where you should be sitting at night). Yeah it was 100 degrees, but who cares. The misters and AC make up for it. It's really not that bad. In fact, it's great!

Once you sit down, you'll get a menu. It's larger than the table!! And a lot of the print is small, so if it's dim outside, I suggest bringing a flashlight. Kidding. Use your phone. Hee hee.

I ordered the Big Rig. A nice hearty portion of rigatoni with a fantastic tomato sauce that has a hint of chipotle. Two delicious slices of garlic bread. All for under 10 bucks.

The service is fantastic. Servers are VERY attentive. 

I peeked at the pizzas on other tables and they looked fantastic.

THIS is your fantastic date spot. It's not pretentious, but it's not weak either. A cozy atmosphere, with great food that you can share. 

One suggestion: Try the Bollo Pasta. A giant bowl of linguini with a tomato sauce. It tastes like the linguini was born in the sauce (LA Friends...Gardens of Taxco anyone?....) It's all you can eat too. And cheap. 6-7 bucks.

I'd come back. I'd also come back after that. I want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is my absolute favorite restaurant in the valley. I used to live here and would often have lunch or dinner here. Now that I've moved away, I always make sure to eat here at least once while here visiting. The Pablo Picasso salad is my favorite, the smaller one is so huge I can never finish it by myself!  Their pizza is the best in town and if you have room, make sure to order a pizza cookie!"}
{"text":"We had a family gathering and chose this location. We figured since they're an Italian restaurant that serves family style portions they would be more than willing to accomadate our group. Turns out they get really irritated when you come in a group bigger than 4. We initially called for a reservation but they don't take them. So we happily walked in and when we asked for a table for 10 they glared at us and said they couldn't accommodate us. We said we didn't mind splitting up if needed and they said there was only 1 table in the entire restaurant they could offer us and the wait would be 1-2 hours if we wanted it. We decided to drink and socialize on the patio and wait for the table. We ended up waiting longer than 2 hours and upon being seated we sat for at least 15 minutes with no server or initial greeting. I went up front and let a server know our situation and she said she would send help. The server we had was named Christina and although it was obvious we were not meant to be her table, she helped us anyways. Fortunately she was so attentive she was able to save our experience but we will without a doubt never come to this location as a group ever again. Which  seems like what you guys wanted anyhow."}
{"text":"One afternoon I was standing in a unnamed field in Las Vegas when I asked Christopher G. a very simple question.  \"What is you favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area?\"  \"Oregano's\" was the immediate response.  I mean it was so matter of fact (like a thunder clap) I stood there stunned.  There was now momentary pause.  There was no eyes drifting up and to the right....It was a very serious statement.  When time would permit..I searched the oracle and found...wait...multiple locations (chain)?!  I would eventually get clarification from Chris G. that the Scottsdale location was ground zero I sought.

The GF and I one day would travel from one desert to another.  The primary destination was one that would afford a base camp for Padre spring training and a place to lay our heads.  A previously laid book mark told use we were not far from Chis G's restaurant conviction.  

We plugged the coordinates into the iPhone, which took use to location in question bypassing the Friday traffic.  Sweet!!

We arrived shortly before the witching hour and were quickly seated.  This was around 1700 hours, MST.  I say this because we missed the window for the patio.  Sad, because it was beautiful day, but we were able to find seating inside the restaurant.  

With Dean Martin playing in the background, our kick ass waitress arrived and took care of us.  Cheesy garlic bread was ordered and some cocktails.  Bread arrived and was tasty.

I ordered the \"Alfredo The Dark. \"Poblanos, pasta and cream, oh my! First, we take the finest cream and teach it Spanish! Then our Poblano peppers and a special blend of Southwest cheeses are sautéed with a spiral pasta. It's topped with diced Roma tomatoes, a tasty jalapeno and our \"south of the border\" bread. There's nothing to be \"Alfredo\" of. Try it with sausage, meatballs, or chicken\" (http://oreganos.com/menu/pasta/).  It was delicious!

Oregano's also offers a cheap AYCE bowel of pasta option.  I relayed this to Christopher G. and sadly he was concerned about the taste of the pasta option rather than the quantity.  I could not say. Maybe franchising has destroyed the mystique of Oreganos.  I don't know.  I will say if you want to see for yourself arrive early and there is ample parking to the rear."}
{"text":"Ok let's just start by saying we love Oreganos. And we were so happy that one opened up on the \"west side\". First off there are a whopping 4 seats at the bar.  What??!!  Then the hostess tried her hardest to turn away our business stating that the wait was 90 minutes and that the \" bar is full\" so do you still want to put your name in?  We proceeded into the bar for a drink and the bartender was less that happy to serve us also!!  There were several tables wide open so we were confused about the 90 minute wait?  Then a waitress came to get us within 20 minutes not 90!  I will say that once we were seated our waitress was good and so our evening was salvaged.  However, we will probably drive to Paradise Mall location for a better experience."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is one of my favorite chain restaurants in the valley! The Goodyear location is one of the newest locations to open up.

The good: The god is always very delicious and I haven't had anything I didn't like. The atmosphere is great! You feel like you are in little Italy in Boston, New York, or Chicago. The pizza is amazing by and the portion size is huge! If you leave hungry then you must have a tape worm...the pizookie is a must try for dessert. My favorites are the macadamia nut and salted Carmel cookies.

The bad: there is always close to an hour wait when you come for dinner. The service was just okay and it took over an hour for our food to come out on a Tuesday night. The bathrooms are horrible... they are never very clean and only one stall and urinal for the whole restaurant and bar. Also end up waiting for a stall.

With all that said I still come back for the great quality food!"}
{"text":"While we were visiting family and looking at homes for sale, my wife and I became hungry and saw this restaurant and thought we would try it.  As soon as we walked in and were greeted efficiently and professionally, we were seated and the waitress, Angila welcomed us and brought our drinks, and she went over the menu with us explaining everything and gave us the lunch and other recommendations.  She gave us wonderful service and was one of the finest servers we have ever had any where.  We both ordered the side salad and pasta, we were both stuffed after the salad, but we managed to eat part of the pasta and took the rest home for dinner.  The food was well served and very tasty, and we might just have to move to Surprise so we can eat here.  Kudos to the food and the help, especially Angila for being so great.  We will be back."}
{"text":"if your looking for a place with big great delicious portions of food this is your italian place to go amazing food and i love to eat big sizes just my style glad to come across an amazing place like this that cares about there food and quality!"}
{"text":"Yum ... I think this is the third Oregano's chain we've been to and it did not disappoint!  Great pasta, pizza and you have to get their cookie pizza.  It is to die for!"}
{"text":"4.6/5 stars - Hard to find good pizza on the west coast but Oreganos is the best local chain in Phoenix. Best pizza to order is thin crust pepperoni and mushroom. Don't over-think it with the gourmet toppings, God made pepperoni for a reason."}
{"text":"I love oreganos! My favorite dish is the Alfredo the dark. The sausage is spicy and delicious and if you like heat like o do ask for extra roasted jalepeno and chop them up in the dish. Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't LOVE this place. Seriously one of my favorites. Is it crazy busy, yes. Do you have to wait forever to eat, yes. But it's just so worth it to me. We like to order to go a lot and it's much easier. Always friendly service, quality food. We are picky eaters in our family and have to order the ziti with marinara sauce due an allergy and occasionally they make a mistake with that but are always quick to fix. They are human, they aren't perfect but truly always pleasant and I love almost everything I've tried. Thanks Oregano's, so grateful I don't have to drive to Scottsdale anymore to enjoy!!"}
{"text":"My worst restaurant experience of 2017. I arrived at 5pm on a Saturday night and the service was extremely poor for the following reasons: 

- Took our drink order and did not return to take our meal order for 10 minutes 

- Received a thin crust pizza even through we ordered a Pan pizza with pepperoni 

- We ordered the pizza & dessert at the same time. The dessert arrived 10 minutes after we finished eating our pizza 

Do yourself a favor and walk over to Blaze pizza instead, you'll have a better dining experience"}
{"text":"Oregano's service and food is top notch. The only negative is no (Wheat and Gluten free) menu. The Oregano favorite salad is my favorite since I am Wheat free. And to make it even more special one can choose lettuce or spinach or half lettuce and half spinach. A half order is adequate for lunch or dinner. A full order is more than most people eat. And if you aren't WHEAT free; (notice I cheated once of a few bites) the killer skillet baked hot from the oven Chocolate chip or Macademia nut cookie with icecream are a must. Or you can have half Chocolate chip and half Macademia nut. They aim to please.   I have eaten at all the Valley of the Sun locations and Flagstaff. They are all equally excellent in service and food. I was delighted when Oregano's opened a location at Elliot and I10 near where I live. I bring all my out of town guests to Oregano's."}
{"text":"I went back to the scene of the crime last night, Oregano's @ 1130 S. Dobson Rd., Mesa, AZ the location of my introduction 2005. To my delight, Oregano's has a Gluten Friendly menu. I have been asking for years and my wish came true with one caution. Because the kitchen equipment and working space are shared with Wheat products, Gluten Friendly means that there could be some contamination with Wheat. While some people might not be able to tolerate any Wheat, a little contamination won't affect me. Now if I can convince them to offer Wheat free sinful cookie cooked in a dish with ice cream on top, I'll be happier."}
{"text":"What's not to like about a pizza cookie?! The lines can be super long though, and the food is good, but not like outta this world or anything. We waited about 1 hour to get our food, server had bad attitude, so basically food is good, but service sucks."}
{"text":"Came here with a group because even though we were in a mall with mostly Asian food options everyone wanted \"Western food.\" So we walked in and were told immediately that there was a 15 minute wait. So we waited with all the other suckers in the entranceway. When we were taking to the back finally The place we were seated was in the back patio where the misters were running full blast. So I shared a pizza with some other folks. Real basic pizza - pepperoni. When it came I noticed it was very salty. Luckily I was sharing so I didn't have to eat all of it myself. Really, the quality was on par with Chuck E. Cheese or some other place like that where the food is not the main reason for your attendance. The soft drink I was drinking from had a slightly flat taste. Service was very good, though. Probably the only thing I can complement the place on. Really makes me wonder why there are long lines to get in. Meh. I won't ever do this again. I'll be the sole dissenting voice if our group ever brings up this idea again. Lots of parking - in the same mall as Saketini, Hodori, Asiana Market, Best Hong Kong Dining, and Szechuan Express."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the location on Scottsdale/Shea and this was my first time at this location, honestly unaware it even existed.

I met a girlfriend here for lunch, right at 11 (opening time) and it was crowded within minutes.  

Our waitress was supremely wonderful, with excellent service and really great demeanor.  

Why not 5 stars?  The portions are half the portion size of every other Oregano's I've ever been to, and that's not okay.   Both my gf and I were a bit taken aback by the lack of food, which is a bit off putting.

Overall, great experience and great food."}
{"text":"I LOVE me some Oregano's I just don't happen to share that same sentiment with this location.  Our server seemed bored and completely uninterested in helping us or being at work, which is fine but can you at least fake it and do I have to ask when its a good time to place my order, or to get refills, or to get a box or to order dessert or to get a to go cup? I mean, c'mon.  

My review is simply on the service.  The food was good, as always. Never will go back to this location though, which is a shame."}
{"text":"Despite my reservations about their thin crust, Oregano's really is a great Italian restaurant.  Took my girlfriend there the other day, and at the end she asked/accused \"Why have you never taken me here before!?!\"  Needless to say she liked it.  She loved the food, liked that they didn't hesitate when she special ordered her Rigatoni with a different sauce, she liked the atmosphere, the mixed drink was potent, my lasagna was very good and we loved the side of meatballs we both ordered.

We might just be back for drinks and meatballs sometime . . ."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere. The portions are huge so feel free to share! The dip KaBoom dip was outstanding. The pastas and salad were also a huge hit."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the caesar salad here with chicken! It is HUGE and under $10. Other than that though, I don't really know what I'd get - the menu isn't my favorite, not a lot I'd like to try.  My husband got the chicken lasagna and said that was good. Garlic bread isn't all that great (coming from someone who LOVES bread, that's saying something). We even got the cheesy bread the second time and my husband swore it smelt like plastic lol. Oh boy! And it smelled like garbage all around the area outside - what's that about?"}
{"text":"The pan pizza was a winner! After looking at the size of the pizza we were skeptical of if that would fill us up! Pssssh let's just say we had lunch the next morning hahaha. Very very very good a** pizza. I was happy we tried the pizza will pay the extra expense of a $20 pizza."}
{"text":"I try this place on a recent trip to Arizona and I absolutely loved it! The garlic bread is phenomenal... their pizzas are great... and so is their cookie dessert! I really wish they had one of these in San Diego I probably frequent it pretty often!

 I really liked the Decour inside - it was super cute! The customer service is great - no complaints!

Give this place a try especially if you're in the mood for Italian food! You must have dessert don't leave without it! If you're too full to consume it there, no worries, just tell them and  they will be lad to package it up and send it home with you - that's what I did! Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a thick crust large pizza with sausage and pepperoni for pickup. The crust was thinner than what I remember from a few years ago which was the last time I had pizza from the Tempe location. Neither of us could detect more than a few slivers of pepperoni and there was a very modest amount of sausage. What we did get was a couple of pounds of cheese and not much else, the sauce was nice and spicy but was only around the outside."}
{"text":"I had the best experience at Oreganos! My server was Rose on Friday! We never had a spar moment of wondering where our server was. She defiantly knew what she was doing. She was an expert on the menu. I got the antipasta salad and Rose helped me with what I did and and didn't want she really work with my order! Salad was huge and fantastic! She recommend doing the dressing on the side so I can take the huge salad home. That was a awesome idea! My girlfriend got the pesto penne and love it, it was almost gone! Glasses were always filled  and we got a pizza cookie! Best part of the meal! I will defiantly be going back to Oreganos, and asking for Rose's section."}
{"text":"Fresh food and the service is great 90% of the time.  Only complaint is the frequent wait list."}
{"text":"Service was great.  The food wasn't too bad. This was the first time I tried Oregano's.  Maybe, my expectations were a bit high.  Why does everything have to be southwestern spiced, lately?  If I want Mexican food, I go to a Mexican restaurant.   Garlic, Oregano, maybe some pepperoncinis (on the side).   That's Italian."}
{"text":"Sorry but this place has gone downhill since opening. Cold sauce, bartender had snippy attitude. Turkey on sandwhich was so dry it was actually crispy. Smelled like it was rotting. When I complained that the sauce was cold she took our 2 meatballs and returned with one. wtf? I complained again about the missing meatball. She said you told me your meatball was cild and i replied that's not what said. I said the sauce was cold and it ruined the meatball. And now the bartender was done with us. I asked for to-go boxes because I'd  had enough. Wasn't going to eat there. Bartender practically threw the boxes at us. I asked her what was up with her attitude and she said I'm trying to be polite. She said she didn't have an attitude, I said clearly your attitude has changed since I complained at which point she said let me get my manager. I agreed with her on that. Manager took close to 10 minutes to come  talk to us and the place was not busy at all. Didn't complain about the sandwhich because we didn't have any of it until we got home. We used to love the place. Sad. I'm sure I'll go back though."}
{"text":"I just got home from picking up an order to go at your Oregano's restaurant on Bell Road in Glendale AZ. I am on crutches because i have broken bones in my foot. when i arrived one of the handicap spots was taken by a white pickup truck without handicap plates or a hang tag. I was in my car for a few minutes gathering my purse and crutches and watched one of the employees loading food into the truck. When i went in to pay for my food i asked to speak to the manager. The manager came out and when i voiced a concern that an employee was taking up one of only two Handicap parking spots he responded with \"this is private property and we can do whatever we want\" - I then stated that the city of Glendale may have a different opinion of that  and the manager said : \"Do you have a handicap plate\" When i said that i did he asked me if it is because i am a veteran. When i told him that it was because i have broken foot (mind you he can see i am on crutches and with a boot on my foot) he said \" Oh well i have a handicap parking plate as well because i am a veteran\" and then walked back into the kitchen. Very disappointing that this is the type of service your company provides. I will NEVER spend my money there again as i choose to spend my hard earned money somewhere that customers are treated with courtesy."}
{"text":"I really want to give 4.5 stars because they use soybean oil for their fries (soy allergy), but it's not like I didn't have enough food after the cheese bread and deep dish pizza with Gorgonzola. My 3 year old nephew demolished all of it from the fries to the bread and the pizza. It's not often you see such a picky child (as if he's been to culinary school), enjoy a meal like that. Next birthday gift: Oreganos pizza. Oh and that macadamia nut white chocolate cookie? Who knew such a thing would melt in my mouth and cause pleasant dreams of future sugar comas....happy sigh."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat and not to mention the wonderful customer service and hospitality that was shown by General Manager Tony and crew.  I love coming here and seeing all the smiling faces.  The food is always sooo excellent!  I want pizoookie tonight!!!!"}
{"text":"Our experience tonight was so bad that I'm leaving my first ever yelp review. We arrived at 5:20pm and were told a 30 minute wait. We have a small child so at 6:30pm when we still hadn't been called we asked and they said we were next and a table was being cleared. Which they then sat a different group at and left us waiting -- apparently they hadn't actually checked that we were next when saying that that our table was ours. We inquired again and were told the same thing again. Finally an hour and 45 minutes after we arrived an assistant manager came out to say there was still no table for us AND they had run out of cheese so also no pizza. So after almost 2 hours we left with a starving kid and never having been seated -- and also with no apology. It was about as bad as service can be without ever being seated and ruined our family's night. I don't recommend bothering with this place."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's, I tried the ricotta filled pasta, it was supper yummy, I personally asked for sundried tomatoes on them and I swear they made the dish extra yummy! My family and I went to celebrate my sister's graduation. We waited about 10 minutes then were seated in a  booth. I really don't have any complaints besides there being a ton of flies inside, must have been because they had the door open... But other then that I will def come back again!"}
{"text":"Very cool place, it was my first time going. We shared a Caesar salad which could feed three people as well as the calamari and we split a traditional lasagna. The salad was so good and the croutons were very flavorful. The calamari was very big I just think the marinara sauce was a tad bit bland and could have used some spice. The lasagna was very good I loved the spice the only thing that kind of made me gag a bit was the layer of meat or sausage they used. I've never had lasagna that did a layer of meat Instead of ground beef or sausage and not used as a patty almost. Staff was friendly, very loud with a lot of family's with loud kids but the food overall was yummy. I would come again and try something new."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious food and yummy Bellinis!  I highly recommend the whole menu, I haven't had a disappointing meal yet.  The only thing is there usually is a wait. Plan you outing accordingly"}
{"text":"This is the newest in the Oregano's chain.  If someone didn't tell you it was on Cactus at the PV Mall you'd swear you were in any of their other locations.
This place gets packed! A relatively early dinner (5:30) on a Friday night required a 20 minute wait for a table.  Not bad, but plan ahead.

The service is outstanding.  They have the happiest employees I've seen in a restaurant.  Seriously, these people could work at Disneyland.

Our party of six had thin crust pizza, a junior meatball sandwich, the baked zitti, rigatoni and angel hair pasta.  We also shared a fried calamari appetizer.
The calamari was very good.  It's battered, then baked, then pan fried in garlic butter.  Served with marinara sauce. 

Two of us shared a pizza.  It was OK but a bit oily for my liking.  Maybe the deep dish or pan pizza would have been a better choice. All of the pasta dishes were excellent. The junior meatball sandwich was pretty big and comes with fries.  You might want to think twice before you order the full sandwich.

They only have one dessert choice here - they only need one dessert choice here!  The Original Pizza Cookie is available in chocolate chip or white chocolate macadamia nut.  We ordered both and shared.  DAMN! Half cooked cookie dough and ice cream - who knew it was so good?

Did I mention the service?

Will we be back - yep!"}
{"text":"This has been an all time favorite dining that I haven't visited in months. Glad I came back. As we walked up to the host area a slew of people were sitting and waiting for their tables. Of course the wait for a table was 30 minutes-ish. The hostesses luckily had square sampling of thin crust pizza to calm the hunger. While waiting we went over to the bar area where I sipped on a moscato.  Cold crisp sweet adult grape juice! One seat at the bar was so close to the dusty register that it was a good thing that we didn't eat food there. Kind of awkward to be dining with wires from the register in front of your face and no room to eat. 

Table finally arrived and with so many choices we picked the Oreganos favorite salad, Parmesan line wings and Alfredo the dark. The waitress asked if we wanted one of the plates to come first and I suggested that the salad come first. ....... Nope. Didn't happen. All the plates came out at the same time - as not suggested and waiting so long for the salad that should not have taken 15 minutes-ish. 

The salad is always great because it's reasonably packed with kalamata olives, romaine lettuce, feta cheese, roasted red peppers, red onion rings, pine nuts and honey vinegarette. The pine nuts tasted stale and old. Luckily those dropped to the bottom of the plate. Wings were great. The pasta dish was supposed to be composed of the poblanos pasta diced Roma tomatoes and cream. For some reason I didn't get much of the poblano punch in it. This was more of a vanilla dish for me. 

Leftovers were packed in front of the table - which is how every restaurant should pack. The night was overly stuffed like a thanksgiving turkey but enjoyed the many bites."}
{"text":"The cheesy marinara bread this time was amazing! Just enough cheese, bread was nice and soft. The pizza did not take too long coming out either a nice 18 in pepperoni. Visited on 12-19-14, can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"every time i'm in az, i have to stop by.  great service and incredible food.  the big rig with meatballs and sausage is my recomendation"}
{"text":"Service was slow for 4:30 in the afternoon - but, the beer and pizza made it all worth it.  I like the fact you can buy a pitcher of beer and save money (assuming someone else is doing the driving - LOL).  The Chicago thin crust pizza is some of the best tasting pizza I have experienced in the Chandler area.  The big drawback is the parking situation.  Get there by 4 PM if you want to find a good place to park.  After 5, you probably have to do valet parking or come by bicycle or donkey."}
{"text":"Morgan was an amazing waitress! Friendly, kind, and caring! The food was delicious as always! Perfect evening! Can't wait to come back! 100% recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Been here two times and tried 3 different types of pizza and other sides. Not impressed. Digorno pizzas tastes much better. Go to NYPD or even order Dominoes. Skip this overrated place. 2 stars for service."}
{"text":"Not a bad wait on a Wednesday night. Friendly staff and the food was delicious. We had the wings, Italian gold seasoning, and the spoccili pizza, stuffed style. All was delicous, even the kids loved it!! And we topped it off with a dessert pizza cookie, which is a must have!! We will be coming back on our next trip to AZ!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch at 1:30 pm on a Monday and was seated promptly. Got very good service but thought the thin crust pizza toppings were over priced and the pizza was much too salty."}
{"text":"We had dinner here and it was really a cute place.  Ordered a 'Chicago-style deep dish' pizza.  The crust was definitely NOT like the good Chicago pizzas that have cornmeal and oh-so-tender crusts (a la Lou Malnati's or Giordano's or Uno's). The guys from Oregano's need to make a field trip to Chi-Town to actually eat some of those awesome pizzas.  But, the Oregano's pizza was certainly tasty, and we had plenty to take home - it was actually better re-heated the next day.
Service was pretty ok, but we were served by the bartender, who had to keep running back in forth from our table to the the mixology station.  It was tough to get his attention when we needed something, but he was very, very nice about it."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with the manager PHIL. We had a large group of 20, went there right after Volleyball tournament. We were laughing having a great time out on the patio, when Phil came and told us we were cut off from any more drinks. Mind you we had been there an hour and only had a drink a piece. This is unfortunate because we had just had a Great experience at the Oregano's in Tempe. Drive the extra few miles to Tempe, better service!!!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is a favorite of anyone I take there. And, I think it's the only place where I would actually order a salad. (The Vino Bambino? is awesome!).

I'm a guy, but was talked into having one of their bellinis(sp). If it's a girl's drink, it's quite a potent one. 

And the pizza is wonderful. We've tried most of them.

You have to sit outside to get the whole experience. I don't think I would ever sit indoors."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for first time with husband, and a friend. The food was decent. But the waitress got our friends order a bit wrong. They corrected that no problem. The green salad was very good. We had pasta dishes just ok. Next time I think pizza and salad would be the way to go."}
{"text":"This Oregano's is great! The food is terrific and the ambience is fun and funky. My husband and I always split a pizza with half pesto and half red sauce. There is always a super long wait to be seated and then again to get your food so make sure you go with plenty of time to kill."}
{"text":"Had the \"Jr. Caesar Salad\" and there was nothing JR about it.  Don't be fooled by the name because it really is more than one person should really eat.  The standard size salad would be perfect to share between 2 people and for $10, it's well worth it!  Not even 2 salads at Walmart/Safeway/Frys will cost you $10 and doesn't compare in quality.  Their waitress was excellent, she was professional, had great humor.  All around it was an awesome, experience.  I'm not giving it a 5 star only because I am super critical and 5 start would mean that they went the extra mile to come greet me at my door as I was pulling in and opened the car door for me.  lol"}
{"text":"I have been to many Oregano's around town but this one is by far the worst one yet.  Took the family to eat lunch on a weekday.  We ordered the calamari, order of hot wings, and a stuffed pizza.

When the drink order came, our waitress (some big chested short blonde lady) forgot the lemons to the water.  When one of us asked if we could get lemons for the passion fruit tea, the waitress curtly replied, \"We don't put lemons in passion fruit tea.\"  When asked to get some any way, she begrudgingly went and got some for the tea. 

The calamari... disappointment.  The calamari itself was okay, but I didn't expect the best.  The problem was the lack of portion.  There wasn't enough to even cover the plastic plate it was served on.  Just some scattered about on a large plastic plate.  If the portions are going to be this small, at least put it on a smaller plate to make it LOOK LIKE the portions are larger.  Just try a little bit harder.

The hot wings... good.  I was pleasantly surprised.

The stuffed pizza... first, if you are a regular at Oregano's you know that stuffed pizza take a long time, but generally they are worth it.  Not this time.  When we got our pizza, the pizza crust was thin as paper.  Worst of all, the ENTIRE bottom was burnt!  Not just spots of burnt crust... THE ENTIRE BOTTOM CRUST was BURNT.

The time we were there, we saw our original waitress (big chested short haired blonde) twice.  Then I saw her leave and not say bye or let us know she was leaving.  So we did not get to see another waiter for awhile.  When we finally got our bill, I was very surprised.  They charged $2 for some jalapenos we had asked for.  It was billed as extra toppings for the pizza, but the jalapenos weren't enough to cover a large stuffed pizza.  That was my last straw, I hate getting nickeled and dimed out of little things like extra condiments or pickles.

I really wanted to like this place since it is the closet to our home, but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to for lunch. Of course since everyone knows this you have to plan accordingly (it can take a while to be seated if you come in the middle of lunch). I usually go early or take a late lunch to avoid the lines. 

Once seated, expect the best. The service is always awesome and the food is spot on. Never over/under cooked or too bland or over seasoned.

It is a great place to go and relax during middle of the work day."}
{"text":"First let me say our waiter was FANTSTIC!  Now I have to say the people in the kitchen don't measure up to the wait staff. I had the  KiNG PARMESAN DE EGGPLANT which in the menu is described as \"We take an abundance of beautiful eggplant prepared for it's finest hour and cover it with Italian and Parmano cheeses, special marinara, fresh basil and gently lay it over angel hair pasta. It's served alongside our garlic bread and made fresh daily, so get yours before we run out!\"  NOPE!  Let's start with the \"abundance of beautiful eggplant\" which in reality is a thin pile of two way over cooked pieces of soggy mush.  It was just this side of slimy gross. How you can do that with a pan-fired item is beyond me.  Next let's consider the \"special marinara\" which is next to non-existent in this dish.  There was not nearly enough to give even a thin coat of sauce to the pasta.  Now let's  talk \"angel hair pasta\"  Al dente it ain't!  Overcooked to just before turning into mush it was.  Maybe that is so it has the same texture, or lack thereof, as the eggplant.  It was so over cooked I could not twist it on to my fork!  It just wasn't about to put up with such a technique.  The spoon they put on the plate when they serve you the meal was there, I now believe, for scooping up the overcooked pasta, not for helping to wind it onto the fork.   Now let's talk \"our garlic bread\".  Large crunchy crouton is a more apt description.  This gum shredding morsel was way beyond stale. There was not one speck of soft bread in it.  Why there is a line waiting to eat at this place is a total mystery to me."}
{"text":"Husband and I gave this a whirl after completing our Christmas shopping. We had eaten in the previous place that was there, and did not like the atmosphere or the food, we walked in and were pleasantly surprised, and equally as impressed with the menu. I tried to order several different things but they were out, so I decided with Eggplant parm. It was fantastic. Our waiter was fantastic, he was warm and friendly and actually was genuine about his comments about the restaurant and the fellow staff members."}
{"text":"Minus one star for the amount of time it took. We got there just before the lunch rush, and it still took awhile. 

I sat out on the patio, so I can't comment on the interior, but I LOVED that they had misters outside. Nice touch, Oregano's.

Menu was HUGE!! Pizza's, pasta's, sandwiches. I went with the midday rush, $2.99 for a slice of pizza, $0.79 for extra toppings. My \"slice\" of pizza was actually two large slices. What a value! I loved the thin crust. I added the caesar salad for $2.29 - very good. Not fishy at all. 

Their garlic bread was delicious as well. I wish we'd have tried the garlic CHEESE bread. 

Our server even offered me a refill to go. Nice touch."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Oregano's, it's one of our favorite restaurants. Today, we were disappointed in both the quality of the food and drinks, as well as the service. Our drinks tasted watered down, and for $6.99 a piece, we expect a little more. The serving size, which is usually really large (at least at the Gilbert location) was much smaller. Our server, Taylor, was not very attentive and asked my obviously NOT under aged husband for his ID. It took quite a while just to get our drinks be we were not asked at all if we wanted dessert. We felt very rushed. Over-all, not the best experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim. Im not at all familiar with the area - visiting from California and I'm so glad I did. Service was fantastic. Jason, my server, was friendly and gave genuinely great suggestions about what to order. I love the retro and spunky atmosphere. Service was quick but they don't rush their customers. My Alfredo the Dark was absolutely delicious- shredded chicken in every bite. Anytime I come back to AZ I'm coming here."}
{"text":"Usually this place is good with good service, but not always. It's way too busy most of the time and not worth waiting in line IMO.  What bugs me about this place is how they nickle and dime you on extra sauce and dressing... and they never put enough sauce on the meatball sub (and it used to come with 4 meatballs not 3 BTW).  I usually get that or the big beef sandwich. The big beef is hard to beat.  Picasso salad is good too. I've probably had it 20 times and I was only disappointed with the food and service once or twice. 

Update: just went back after not eating here for about a year and this place is even worse with the nickle and diming.  Fries used to come with sandwiches and now they cost extra.  The sandwiches seem smaller now too -- my \"BIG HOT CHICK PARM\" while tasty was anything but \"big\"... it was 6 inches at most.  We spent $60 (after tip) for 2 beers, 2 sandwiches and an order of wings. The sandwiches were good but smaller than they used to be.  The wings used to be really good, but this time they were meh... definitely not worth the $10.69 for 10.  Based on this last experience, it will probably be another year before I go back here... maybe longer."}
{"text":"Always a hit.  The lunch all you can eat pasta is awesome but ask for the garlic bread on the side otherwise the they put it on top of the sauce and it gets soggy.  Sausage is HOT so be careful.  Kids meal is more than enough and my son loves it!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my son (8) and we enjoy the pasta.  Had he \"bowl\" for me and corkscrew with meat sauce and meatballs for him.  It was all cooked very nice and the meatball was juicy according to him.

We signed up for kaboom club and got a free cookie dessert, was nice but a little bit too doughy for my sons taste but I loved it!!!

The only down side I always have issue with the garlic break touching the sauce - by time I eat it there is less crunch and it's such a shame because it is awesome.

Props to manager Gavin (and server AJ) great teamwork on an issue and made us feel welcome and \"really\" took care care of us.  Coming back and often."}
{"text":"So slow. We ordered one pizza and 2kids slices. We were there for over 2 hours and probably spent 10 minutes eating because we were so hungry by the time it came out. Then it took another 15 minutes to get the change from the bill. The pizza was good but I wouldn't wait again."}
{"text":"Really nice and friendly staff. The pizza's are really tasty but there is a little bit of a wait for them. But to be fair the wait was due to the restaurant being really full. 

You are looking about 12 usd per person for a pizza and drink.

We would go again"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out, whether you are with your entire noisy family or just two adults enjoying some time alone.  I have heard that there are many wonderful salads and pastas to try, but we cannot bring ourselves to order anything but the thin crust pizza!  It is awesome!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was great! Food was excellent and service good. Yes there was a long wait but it was absolutely worth it! We will definitely be back. Just a fair warning if you've never been to an Oregano's: the portion are huge. Salads can easily be shared between 2 people and even the pasta is easy to share. The pizza is amazing, we had the Chicago thin crust. Overall well worth the wait and the visit"}
{"text":"This place is definitely on my favorite list now. First impressions are everything and the service here was nothing short of great. Genevieve was our server and she was on point. I will definitely be coming back to this joint in the near future for some bomb Italian food."}
{"text":"Service not so good today. Waited 1/2 hour for a salad that didn't seem up to the normal quality. Sparse on the chicken and it was cold (normally warm). We've been an Oregano's fan for many years, even though we are tired of the same music all the time. Hope this is not a sign they are going downhill."}
{"text":"The only reason I go back to Oregano's is their pizza cookie. However, now several other chains offer pizza cookies that are the same, if not better. 

The pesto pasta is very good and I like that the Chicken Caesar Salad comes with shredded chicken. However, I have yet to find an entree or pizza that I am really in love with."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable price.  Expect to wait during peak times. Much of the seating is outdoors so weather can impact.  Great thin crust pizza and salads.  Expect 45 minutes for Deep dish."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had!  Always start with kickbutt garlic bread and a Bellini before ordering Chicago stuffed pizza.  But don't forget to save room for yhr Original Pizza Cookie!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for pizza as we had been to other locations of this restaurant. They were very busy and had to wait for a table, so plan accordingly. However the wait was worth it. Really good food, excellent service and our waitress, Jackie, was attentive, responsive, very friendly and professional. Because they were busy they were a bit backed up, but without our saying anything, the waitress and the manager, Travis, stopped by the table, apologized for the busyness and went out of their way to make sure we knew they felt we were important to their business and that they were not meeting their own standards. Very impressive!!  The food was very good and not everyone in our group had pizza but everyone had a great time and enjoyed the food, the ambience and especially the wait staff who were friendly, accommodating and made the visit very pleasurable. Love this place and will definitely be back....frequently."}
{"text":"If you are ever in Phoenix you need to try this place.  Awesome pizza.  But be prepared to wait cause every one I have ever been to is always packed.  But the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Oregano's is an awesome restaurant. Their wings are super large and their prices amazing. The salads are also good. Every meal comes in a huge portion, you will never leave without leftovers! I definitely recommend Oregano's to anyone who wants a lot of food, and the best quality you'll find anywhere."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for the first time Saturday night, and yes it was super busy but for good reason. The food and service is fantastic, and I highly recommend the Big Rig Pasta! Mmm!"}
{"text":"An Oregano's in Surprise, was it worth the wait? I've been to the other Oregano's and the food wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Pretty much the same as the Surprise Oregano's. There is a wait during dinner time and I wouldn't mind the wait if the food was worth it. We shared some calamari and the pieces were huge. Was it delicious? Not really. The pieces were big because, it was heavily breaded. Very chewy and wasn't the best we've had. The chicken parm was ok, a little dry and also heavy on the breading. I do have to agree with the other reviewers here that our food was salty. The portions are big, but the quality was so-so."}
{"text":"We have only been to the Oregano's in Scottsdale before, but we opted to try the Oregano's at Dobson because it's a little closer.  I do not know if we were just lucky on our trips to Scottsdale, but we never had to wait too long to be seated and the food was just spot on every time.

We arrived at around 7:30ish.  We opted to be seated outside because it was recommended and the host said it was not going to be hot because of the misters.  Uh, wrong!  We have been seated outside before, at other restaurants, and the misters make a difference.  Not at Oregano's (because many seats are not near the misters).  After about 10 minutes when no one came to see if we were thirsty, and we were, we went back in to wait for an indoor seat.  

We waited, waited, waited.  People who came in after us were seated. Two ladies came in and the hostess brought them drinks.  We'd been at the restaurant for about 40 minutes by this point, and no one offered us anything to drink. It was frustrating, and if I had not been texting I would not have realized how long we were waiting, but because of the time stamps, I knew how long we were sitting and sitting.  

We finally got seated, and our amazing server, Kelan, had our drinks within a couple minutes.  He topped us off so that we were never thirsty and had plenty to drink while eating.  The service was really exceptional, and it was a relief because by the time we were seated we were frustrated.

The food was fine.  Hardly any jalepeños on the carne asada pizza, but it still tasted good although it lacked any heat.  

Don't think we'd go back to this location, but if I do I hope Kelan is working because he was the only positive about the evening.  Good food, but we could easily get equal quality elsewhere and it is not worth the grief."}
{"text":"Enjoying a Moscow Mule while I wait for my food.  Love this place.  While it's inconsistent as of late it still reminds me of the good ol days.  I highly recommend the Alfredo The Dark with chicken and save room for the cookie!  Well it was a miss this time.  Our server had no personality.  They must have changed their bread because it was dried out and crumbly.  My turkey stuffed sandwich was cold along with the fries and to top it all off there were flys every where.  If I had produced food like this to my tables when I worked at Oregano's, I would not have only been embarrassed but I would have been out of a job."}
{"text":"Fiance and I came here as we were craving pasta and pizza...we were welcomed by the 2 female bartenders who were flat out amazing!! Their infectious personalities and hard work made it a wonderful experience. We were at this location on February 22nd around 5 PM, make sure the ladies working that night get some big time kudos!!! We started with the BOOM dip and it was so much and so filling!! Very good though. I ordered the spinach/broccoli/garlic stuffed pizza, while the fiance ordered a pasta dish. We were both so stuffed from the boom dip that we couldn't manage to finish half of our entrees. I still left some room for the cookie/ice cream dessert...God damn that was good and has made me drool all over my computer while writing this review. The next time we are in town, we will be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was better. It's cheaper which is perfect for a casual date night or dinner with friends. The meals are easily shared and the pizza is definitely made to order. Our server Melissa was so great I asked to speak with her manager. She was patient, quick, easy going and nice. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Loved our experience tonight. Checking in on yelp got us sat right away when we arrived. Server was fast and courteous. Manager stopped by a few times. Everything was prepared as expected no issues. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Wow... The Gandma G's pizza is mind blowing. Plus they have the Joe show at the bar. Ask for a Joehito. Everything here is epic. (Insert mic drop.)"}
{"text":"Was in Peoria for some baseball and heading back to Southern California when hunger hit... just 15-20 minutes outside of Peoria on way home so exited for some pizza.
They offer Chicago style either thin crust or deep dish you choose.  We got the thin and it was just like you get in Lake Forest Illinois!

The antipasto salad was very good and will feed a family with a small size.

The wings are great as well but be warned they are spicy!!!

Service is excellent and yes I will be back!"}
{"text":"Simply the BEST thin crust chicago style pizza in the state!! Worth every minute of the wait - wings are great too!!"}
{"text":"Great dinning, our server Connor was very tentative the spaghetti was delicious and the manager came around to check on how we were enjoying our meal.  Atmosphere was nice and I  would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Oregano's, never lets me down. Food is amazingly delicious! The only flaw is how long it takes for them bring out your food. By the time the food comes out your about to chew on the flesh of the person right next to you because your so hungry."}
{"text":"Everything about this place seems perfect.  The decor, the hostess, the customer service, the atmosphere, etc.. today my first try at what i heard and read was really good pizza, so i ordered thin crust pepperoni and italian gold wings, the wings were okay but the pizza was too salty to eat, and trust me i like salt.  Next time, i'm ordering all better balanced pizza"}
{"text":"Pretty average, at best. 

Im I the only one that finds stereotypical Italian American food, set with a stupid corny Italian \"EHHHYY BABBADII BOP\" themed menu annoying? Maybe that's because I grew up in an Italian neighborhood in NY... This place is a joke, and a flat, unflavored one. 

45-60 min wait for a 10 inch deep dish?? (For the boyfriend, I'd never go against NY thin crust tradition) WUZZAMADDA WIT YOU! (Oreganos feel free to use my amazing authentic Italian catch phrase. It was the only one you didn't use on your menu. 

Wtf is an Italian place doing having guacamole and quesadillas ...  ?! 

The thin crust was very floppy and greasy - signs their oven isn't hot enough and the cheese is low quality. The chicken parm was okay. Standard Disneyland quality IMO. 

Idk man go to downtown Phoenix or somethings - pay the money and go to Pizzaria Bianco or Tratto. Don't settle for this BS. MAMA MIA !!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner after going to the Phoenix Zoo.  This was a great find!

We had two large thin crust pizzas and orders of bbq and hot wings.  The pizza crust was the thinnest I've ever had and it was wonderfully crispy.  The toppings were great and fresh parmesan tossed over the pizza after it was served to the table made it perfect.

The hot wings were some of the best I've ever tasted.

Outdoor seating in the courtyard was neat with overhead heaters, but we had a party of 10.  Long wait for outdoor seating made us decide on an inside seating.  It was still great, although I think the outdoor seating would have been even better.

They don't take call in reservations, by the way.

Great service, great food.  We'll go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Pizzahhhh cookieeeeeeee mmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"The food is not that great quality as compared to Tempe locations of Oreganos. One might also get lucky and get a grumpy nice server, who doesn't care if our silverware is dirty or if the pasta doesn't have sufficient sauce. Better yet the server might have a frown face and give a nasty little nice experience. Maybe we went in 40 minutes before closing to ruin the servers evening. Only nice thing was the sensible manager who stopped by every time, two times in our case, to stop by and help."}
{"text":"Called to make a reservation and they lady who answered was rude. She had said they don't do reservations and I'm more than welcome to rent the catering room, then I asked how much and she directed me to another call wth? Really? So had a big party of 22 brought them business and the waiters we're rude, kept looking for their service. I wouldn't go back here."}
{"text":"Was brought here by my friend who lived in Scottsdale for 5 years before leaving for Chicago. Two years later he still craved the Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato pizza. Not sure how I felt about potato on my pizza, I went along for the ride. Holy Holy Holy! I eat plenty of amazing pizza in Chicago, but I am now in love with one more.  And in Scottsdale of all places. We went for lunch so we avoided the crowds and were so pleased. The other thin crust pizza we had was equally as delicious and so were the salads."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love Thee... Let me count the ways... I start with a nice house red or frozen bellini (my preference, if I'm not counting calories that day), their House made Italian dressing on their salads (to die for),  Medium Gold wings (a secret mix that everybody knows about, ask them when you order), their cheesy bread, Lady is a Scampi. Yum Yum Yum. I love this restaurant and they're always busy, so expect some slow service here and there (which great restaurants usually have a massive crowd) as the food is WELL worth the wait. :)"}
{"text":"The homemade smells greet you at the door to the restaurant, and the local atmosphere is so welcoming. We had the bollo pasta and the lady and the scampi, both were delicious with servings too big to finish in one meal... Already talking about returning for pizza before we return home next week to MN."}
{"text":"Loved the food here! The drinks were spot on! We enjoyed the patio dining. Next time my family and I are in town we plan to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Dinner here the other night, I think Wednesday I had a great time. Our server especially was fantastic! Abby was on the ball, with drinks, our food was hot and served perfect. Never had to ask for a thing!!"}
{"text":"I think it's a good place to eat the food is good, drinks not so much. As a bartender myself, it would be nice to see experience behind the bar instead if cute and young. It's sad when a restaurant can't make a proper margarita! Also why no reservations???!! It's hard to get seated on a weekend night."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to California Pizza Kitchen, the pizzas and salads are very good, they have great variety and great prizes, and the atmosphere is much better. I will  definitely become a regular."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's!  I have to come here every time I visit Phoenix.  The pizza is delicious (both the thin crust and deep dish), and the cheesy garlic bread is sooooooo good.  I love the outdoor seating area and the service has always been great!"}
{"text":"Great food. Pizzas was decent, but I highly recommend ordering some hot wings, salad, and a side order of the garlic bread. I would have given it a 5 star,but my waiter had an attitude problem . Other than that, great atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Visited Tuesday night for dinner and it was crazy busy. We were told it would be about an hour wait. We decided to wait since we love oreganos and it never disappoints.

So we waited the hour and we were finally called into a table. We were seated and our waitress came on over. She took our drink orders and brought them out right away. We placed our food orders and so we waited for out food. 

One large salad (vino bambino)
Large pizza numero uno
Two dozen medium wings 
One kids pepperoni slice

The salad was delicious! So fresh and the concoction was to die for!
The pizza was good! A little to salty but it was good!
The wings had too much of a vinegar taste!

We got our food about after 45mins of placing it but the kids pepperoni never made it. We waited for our waitress to come and bring it to us but she never did. We then had to ask another server to help us with the missing slice. That server then informs us that the pepperoni slice order was never placed. 

We then get another employee come to our table and tells us that it will be a minute until it's ready. My niece was starving but managed to wait patiently for her slice..

A couple minutes later the slice finally makes it to our table, yay!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to this location on Saturday for a late night meal.  He loves oreganos; I'm on the fence with the food. We sat at the bar a little before 9:30 pm.  It wasn't too busy on the patio, but it looked like some people were still waiting.  A server asked us if we were drinking or dining, and then when we said dining, she found the bar tender.  Bartender was a very nice blonde young woman.  She made some suggestions.  I ordered an Alfredo pasta w tigre shrimp, and he had the boLL o Rama (never ending pasta bowl) with a side sausage and an ice t. I also ordered a small side salad (it was huge, cold, crisp and fresh; very good.  Very little ice berg of any).  I asked for a side of balsamic vinaigrette and side of blue cheese.  I wanted to try their dressings.  I don't like many; the blue was good.  

So, as we waited for our water, tea and salad, my fiancé and I watched the bartender dump the ice tea glass by glass down the sink.  Someone gave us water (it had a bad taste to it), and my fiancé finally said to the bar tender, \"Hey, are you going to dump all of that?\".  She smiled, said yes, and Jon then said \"Could I have some then before you dump it?\".  She giggled, and he told her he ordered it.  She clearly forgot.  Food came out (ticket time was long).  As mentioned before, salad was good.  Fiancé asked for a a small side of ranch, he didn't like the balsamic.  Jon enjoyed his pasta and sausage.  My Alfredo was dry.  I asked for a little more sauce(FYI-I don't like a lot of sauce or dressing, so if I think it's dry, it probably is).  It was brought out.  Alfredo sauce was ok, but shrimp beautiful, plump, and cooked right.  Props on that.  I'd like to order with w a salad
Next time.  

So, fiancé orders another bowl of pasta. It's a little after 10 (closing time).  Plenty of people are still dining.  Some people even same in right before 10. 
Bartender said it was probably too late, and said she should have asked.  Sorry, THERE IS NO SECONDS ON A BOLLO RAMA.

She gives us the bill, and we look at the extras.  She still charged jon for the tea that took a good while to receive.  He ordered that when he sat down, before the meal.  

She charged us for a side of dressing.

She charged us for a side of sauce for my dry pasta that looked like it was hanging under the heat lamp.  

My fiancé didn't  want to say anything about the charges, even though he was irritated.  He placed his card in the check book, and as the bartender reached for it, I had to ask her about the charges regarding the sauce and dressing.  He got the tea, 20 minutes after he ordered it, but got it.

She said she'd take off the Alfredo sauce since my pasta was dry.  He was still irked.

Paid the bill, and as we were walking out, the manager on duty, Cynthia, said goodnight.  She mentioned how they brought me extra sauce to make the Alfredo dish even better.  When I heard her say that, I had to stop and mention all of the grievances.  Long ticket time, long drink time, two unnecessary charges. I did say the bartender was nice, but perhaps more concerned about getting off work.  

Cynthia offered another bowl of pasta.  We declined.  It was thoughtful. I told her that my fiancé loved the restaurant, but irked.  She said to let them know to take care of us, and mention her name.  

CYNTHIA, and other managers, I will.  Sometimes customer service beats out amazing food.  My fiancé loves this place, I don't.  But, if you provide excellent customer service, I will keep stopping in.  I hope you will as promised :) thank you, Cynthia.  You actually made me feel a bit better about going back one more time."}
{"text":"The food at Oregano's is pretty darn good. I would certainly like to give them five stars but the service is sub par. I am sitting here 45 minutes after we ordered and still no food. We ordered a big rig, Pablo salad and Brussel sprouts. Also, our waitress, Alex, is not very attentive - that is unless you are one of her friends who walked in. By the way there are less than 10 tables occupied."}
{"text":"We were sat quickly and they had FREE pizza slices for those waiting! The young lady Emily that greeted us was friendly and professional. Ashley our sever was very friendly. We went for my birthday and I got an amazing desert!!! I had the big rig for dinner and my fiancé has the chicken scampi. We both were blown away!! My kids had the cheese pizza which was very good as well. Yes I'm a selfie person (I realize this is considered rude at places to eat as people are busy) however we made sure we ordered before I took pics. A man (I assume the manager) came over and offered to help! Again, this is my birthday so I wanted to remember it. Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"I've been to multiple locations and never had such a bad experience. It was lunch and this was the slowest I've ever seen an oregano's.
We came in for lunch on my boyfriend's birthday. They got my order wrong and my boyfriend's big beef sandwich was absolutely inedible. It was so greasy, I tried to drain it off but it just soaked through the napkin. It was so greasy you could squeeze it and grease poured out of it. I tried to get our servers attention more than once to alert her of our issues, but she never came around. Finally, we were so hungry that we had to split my sandwich I didn't order. I overheard our server comp the table behind us a pizza cookie who were also celebrating a birthday. We ended up paying for a whole meal we didn't eat. I will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"Tried a new dish during annual visit and had two perfect Bellini's, but the new dish wasn't top notch. This was the eggplant parmesan, but it was not a breaded version as the bartender had insisted. It was more like pieces of mushy eggplant with perhaps a bit of bread crumbs on top? and that was smothered in a red sauce which contained a boat full of basil. I was picking basil strips out of the food for the entire session. The bed of angel hair pasta and the garlic bread though were both good. Skip the eggplant, but it did taste better after those Bellini's."}
{"text":"I Love Oreganos! Amazing pasta(Big Rig) and pizza cookie!! If you have never been then you should go!!"}
{"text":"We always make a stop here when we are in town. It is a great family style restaurant with amazing food. There deep-dish pizzas keep us coming back. The deep dish pizzas take about 45 minutes to cook be prepared to wait. We order appetizers and pasta to keep us busy while we wait. They also offer a kids menu with small bites for the little ones. Do not be surprised when there is ball of pizza dough on your menu. They offer one to all the kids to play with while waiting. For starters, we ordered fried ravioli filled with jalapeño cheese, sausage pepper penne pasta that came with garlic bread and hot wings with a side of ranch. I only had room for one slice of pizza by the time it came out. Nevertheless, I wanted to eat more of because it was so good. It is a real deep-dish pizza stuffed with cheeses and meats. We need one in San Diego! Awesome place, lines are always long here. This is a testament to how good their food is!"}
{"text":"Really great food! I'm not an Italian fan but this place is really good. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is upbeat. Goodyear continues to add restaurants and this one is a \"must visit"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza to go. Very soggy, not cooked log enough.
Ordered it and paid for extra Peppers. Got home and couldn't tell if they had put any on. There was very little spice to it. If you want spice don't go there.
It tasted very plain. Pizza Hut makes better pizza. Bummer, paid $30.00 for it with a salad. If you want plain pizza, go there. Glendale location on Bell."}
{"text":"Always a favorite!  Free pizza cookie on your birthday.  Went on a Monday evening and had to wait for 45 minutes -ugh!"}
{"text":"One of  best pizza's I ever had. Love the bistro,atmosphere casual and price and portions are reasonable."}
{"text":"Love Oregano's!  Food is always hot and fresh and plenty of it!  Started with garlic cheesy bread and Italian Wedding soup, then moved on to the bollo pasta with meat sauce, artichoke lasagna and alfredo the dark.  Our waiter Marvin was the best!!  Will be back in soon!"}
{"text":"They have some really original combinations.  The pizza I had was great and a good size---I actually got two meals out of my lunch.  Service is a bit slow so don't stop here if you are in a hurry.  It took us about 45 minutes to get a salad and thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Crazy delicious and Crazy reasonably-priced! My first time, and i was floored by how big the portion was for the price. And i only got a LUNCH portion... whew- i cannot wait to go back to try all the other dishes! I got the lunch size Bug Rig w/meatballs (server recommended for 1st timers) and it was amazing! Sister got the eggplant deal, which it was hard to know where to get started since it was HUGE! Get to-go boxes, because these leftovers are even better!"}
{"text":"Hailing from Chicago and New York, my boyfriend and I thought there was no way pizza in the middle of Arizona could even compare. Well, insert foot into mouth. Or rather, just insert some more of Oregano's pizza into my mouth! 

Mmm mmm! Get the guac-a-tony. I know what you're thinking. Italians? Pizza? Guacamole? Really? Yes, really. They serve typical guacamole, but instead of tortilla chips you get a 14-inch pizza crust topped with a thin layer of parmasean cheese to scoop up all of the avocado-y goodness. Salivating yet? You should be. Beware! It's a HUGE portion. Made more for four than for two, but we held our own. Pizza itself was phenom. Thin, crispy, great flavor in the sauce. My only regret was that we ate so much guac-a-tony that we couldn't eat more pizza. Hopefully there's a next time if I'm ever back in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Good food.... love the sausage, Mac and cheese and Brussels. I've only had carry out (pick up) give them at least 20 min and check your order.... first time I arrived home w/someone else's. Second time they gave me broccoli instead of Brussels, that being said, the food is really good.... sausage nice and spicy, LOVE the roasted Brussels and the Mac and cheese is yummy..."}
{"text":"Love their wings, but not so much their pizza. Good place to take the family. Friendly service and quick!"}
{"text":"We went into the restaurant at about 5:00 pm on Saturday and wanted to lace a small takeout order (one order of pasta and one salad).  We were told that due to large catering orders, we could not get take-out until 7:00 pm.  I wonder what they would have done if we had sat at a table and ordered our food, told us that we had to wait two hours?  We instead went a couple of hundred yards away to Babo (another Italian place) and got our order in about 15 minutes.  We were very disappointed by Oregano's (lack of) service and will likely not go back."}
{"text":"My review is for the service. The food is delicious here. We came on a Wednesday (party of 4 with 2 young kids) and were told it would be 20 mins to wait. We figured that was fine b/c we could keep the kids entertained for that long. It wasn't 20. It was 40. As we were shown to our table, I slipped on the floor (it was COVERED in dirt, oil, old food) as I'm carrying my 5 month old and almost fell. Thankfully my husband was there for me to hold onto! It took a while before we got our food which again, would have been fine if we didn't have a 2.5 year old and 5 month old. The long wait ruined it for me and the leftover pizza was gross the next day. I might try it again without our kids but with little ones, this is definitely not a place to go."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised at the cheerful interior, and cleanliness.  Our first trip to Oregano was a fun one.  I ordered the Vino Bambino small salad and was only able to eat 1/2 of it - apparently servings are large throughout the menu.  Salad was good & crisp. 
Everything was great, including music - it could've been turned  down a little as the acoustics seemed to amplify noise.  Look forward to going again soon"}
{"text":"The food was good but there were so many flies we could not even eat. I have never seen so many flies in my life I complained to the manager and he said yeah it's that time of the year. Really?

The salad arrived at the table with three flys already in the salad. I had to put a napkin over the pizza to protect it from the flies. Within seconds the flies attacked the napkin- pretty gross"}
{"text":"The Pablo Picasso salad is hands down the best salad I have ever had anywhere.  The service is excellent and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great to take the wife out too. We loved the atmosphere had a vintage feel to it. Our waiter was great and the food was good. You must have the baked cookie with ice cream it was to die for."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I have ever had! My favorites at Oregano's are their Margarita Pizza and their customized deep dish pizza. Super delicious, however plan ahead, because their pizza takes time to cook. I look at this place and see they make all their food with extra love; I am more than willing to wait and pay the price for eating their delicious food. Oh, and leave room for their pizza cookies, super super yummy! :)"}
{"text":"I like the chain of Oregano's restaurants. Not a huge fan of the deep dish pizza, but do like the thin pizza. The \"Big Rig with sausage \"is my favorite!!! Can have long lines and sometimes I am just not in the mood to wait 30-45 minutes at lunch or dinner. Good consistent service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Overall the food and hospitality are very good. Thin crust Chicago pizza is a hit every time. Salads are great. Mixed drinks are fine. Fun place, great atmosphere.

Room for improvement - Think about a water filtration system. It's tap water with a nasty aftertaste. Affects the flavor of ice teas and other drinks. Reservations would be great or at least the ability to put your name on a waiting list when wait is over 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, although this is my first review.  I love coming here because it is different. Not fancy but consistently good. I do not like coming here because when I do, I eat too much!  The portions here are large. I always have to start out with their Guac a Tony, So good!  Today we got the margarita pizza which was ok, and the número one. I did not try that but was told it was very good.
The salads looked great, so will have to go back soon to try one. Staff was very friendly and our waiter was great!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Oreganos!
This location specifically is my favorite.
The vibe here is quite nice and the service is great! 
For pasta I would recommend the Zany Zity or the pesto one. I love that they come in bread bowls! The Picasso salad is great as well and can feed 2-3 people! I love that they have huge servings that you can share. The wings and pizza are great as well!! 

The only frustrating part about this location is that the parking lot is small and makes it hard to find parking, especially on busy days. 
Another thing I wish is that Oreganos did reservations! 
Other than that one of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"I LOVE OREGANO'S. This is seriously my favorite place ever. Their Lady is a Scampy is my favorite on the list. It's absolutely delicious. Pizzookies are a must have, and if you love garlic tomatoes and bread you'll love their bruschetta. AMAZING. I could never get sick of this place. Ever."}
{"text":"Should have brought 4 more people to help eat the delicious deep dish pizza, garlic bread, pesto penne and pizza cookie than the 4 we had in our group. mmm, delicious! Service was good, food was delicious, and the atmosphere was very casual. This is a great place to relax and have a beer and food on a Friday night..or Saturday, or Monday..Tuesday..."}
{"text":"Seriously no concept of wait time.  Told it was 30 min at most.  Was 50 and server still not here.  Lied and told us table was being wiped down.

Oh boy, now food has been over 45 min."}
{"text":"The Oregano's favorite salad with Chicken is one of my favorite salads. They load the small size up with a ton of chicken and good feta and the red onions that are marinated in something and a surprise is the raisins and red peppers. It appears that you won't be able to finish the salad, but the honey vinagerette is really light and any real man should be able to avoid the to-go box on this puppy. Maybe including a piece of garlic toast would be great. Nice outdoor patio at this location and part of bar is fully outside. I think my other reviews are from wrong location when I just moved out here, but food is the same at all locations basically. I grabbed a fortune cookie and I either ate the fortune or I got a dud, very weird. About $10 for the meal."}
{"text":"This location has a nice patio, but it is too close to parking lot and a bunch of flies make their home out there as well. My salad was huge as usual for a small and I can't recall the name, but it had feta and cranberries I think and then I added chicken for three bucks more. You know what you are getting here and it's usually good and worth the price since leftovers are almost always available."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!!! Mmmm! 

When you get your pizza you can smell the flavors marinating! It's so heavenly!! I love their thin crust and their pan pizza. The thin crust is crispy and let's the toppings do most of the talking. Then you have the pan, which is thicker but soft and non greasy.  
I love the pan crust with pepperoni and jalapeños! It's so cheesy and the jalapeños are so spicy it's a yummy combination. Then my other favorite is the thin crust which is called the original crust with pepperoni, sausage, olives and onions. This pizza smells like pizza but with a deep Merlot smell to it, it's so yummy! The sauce is splendid! Not only is it a tomato sauce but it has chunks of tomatoes in it. This is quality pizza overall, it tastes authentic and you'll be craving more!"}
{"text":"Was a packed, busy Friday night. I was hesitant because I thought it was going to be a typical \"chain\" restaurant. Oreganos ended up being my favorite restaurant for my entire trip! Pasta was amazing, best sausage I've ever had. Most surprisingly, the salads are amazing!  Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"They're smega lit!!!!! Best pizza laterally ever!! With all the golden BBQ sauces for days!!! Yeet! You should totes comes eat here if you eat good food in your mouth. They're linguine noodles are like 42 feet long. Best pasta in the worlds and the servers and the littiest lit peoples, it's like the Dutch bros of Italian food! Liegalize marinujana! Come eat with me, it's be fun. Maybe we could catch a movie afterwards or something who knows! Why won't oreganos let me post this review, this is an outrage! Is it because I'm white?!? That's racist!"}
{"text":"This was a very good pizza spot with a nice deep dish pizza and dinner salad. We had the cheesy bread for appetizers with a marinara sauce which was also very tasty. The service is above par and the family enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Chicago thin crust pizza here, the Cajun chicken topping is flavorful and works well with other toppings like pineapple.  The stuffed mushrooms were a bit plain, they didn't have enough going on, just some meat piled into a portobello.  I wish I had had time to try the Chicago stuffed pizza, but it takes 40 minutes and a group doesn't always want to wait that long.  Based on my experience, the stuffed pizza is likely delicious as well."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight with my husband and 15 month old son and we all left very happy!

First off, with my 15-month old, he's at a stage where he doesn't want to be spoon-fed, but isn't very good at feeding himself yet. I hate going to a place where the cheapest item on the kid's menu is $8 because 75% of it will wind up smeared on the table, highchair, and on the floor. Oregano's offers a kid's slice for $2.99. Can't beat that price! In addition, it came out cut up into little kid-sized chunks AND the staff moved it off of the hot plate it was cooked on and onto a cooler platter. THANK YOU! I very much appreciate not having to shuffle the whole table around to avoid my son burning his hand on a hot plate!

The atmosphere is fun, casual, and lively. We sat indoors, but even in the heat of Scottsdale in June, the patio seating was shady and cooled by misters. We could've enjoyed our stay there, too.

Our server (Justin, i think?) was incredibly attentive without being overbearing. He never let our drinks run dry and was just really, truly, a pleasant addition to the evening!

We ordered the Boom Dip. YUM! I'm a big fan of spinach artichoke dip, but this is definitely a contender for the best I've ever had. Very heavy on the artichoke where most are mainly cheese. I liked it!

My husband and I split the O-Riva Pizza. The ingredients were very fresh and the crust was super thin. I personally would have preferred a little bit thicker crust, but I'll just try out a pan crust next time. The taste was great.

In all, we had a very good time. It was a great place for dinner with the family and we'll definitely be back to check out more of the menu."}
{"text":"So delicious. I can't even pick a favorite meal from here they are all so good. The chicken parm, the meatball sandwich, the pizzas, the spicy shrimp pasta, it's all amazing. The best part is that I can order pizza and wings or anything else from here, have it ready in 30 minutes no matter what time of day, and it's the same price as it would be to have a regular pizza place deliver. I usually pick it up so I know it's hot, but there are over 5 delivery apps that will pick it up and bring it to you for $5 if you don't want to leave the house. Also my wife loves the Peach Bellini. Lots of alcohol and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on hostess service at Camelback/7st location. 

We were so hungry  and craving pasta from Oregano's. Knowing that wait can be long, we called as we were  three minutes away to make sure the wait is not going to be 40 minutes. 

The guy on the phone told me that they had several tables inside and few outside. We pulled in three minutes later and based of hostess greeting us, I should of known it will not go well. 

She takes our name, barely greeting us and does not tell us about how long the wait will be at all. I see tables outside but she is not even going to check and see if they are available. Five minutes in, we change our outside table to inside one since at this point we are not getting seated. 

She changes it without telling us again, how long the wait will be. At this point, I am super hungry and getting a little frustrated. 

I finally ask another hosted who was cheat cheating there, how long will out wait be? She tells us 20 minutes! I was so mad at that point. Empty tables, which I can see with my eyes and after ten minutes of waiting they tell me, oh the wait will be 20 minutes. The place is clearly slow. 

I know that sometimes they might not have enough chefs, servers....but please. This was such an awful experience. My time and money are imported to me as they are to everyone else and when somebody disrespects it-not good. 

We walked away, as I was not ready to leave my money there after that treatment. So sad as I wanted the pasta and I always had good service at this Camelback Oregano's! 

I recommend that hostess get some additional training on how to communicate, especially when you are working in the industry where hungry people are at your door at all times."}
{"text":"It is still good and I still enjoy it ---- but----- it used to be better. I guess food costs must be going up and rather than raise the price-- which they could very easily--- they instead reduced the serving size. 
Had an Italian Stuffed sandwich today and it used to really live up to the name--- today it was just an Italian Sandwich.  Maybe I will loose some weight now!
Hope it doesn't change much more though!"}
{"text":"Great salads and apps, better than the pizza actually. Not a fan of their thin crust, it's pretty tasteless."}
{"text":"Frequent diner at all Oreganos throughout the valley... Was a \"regular\" at the original local and always have loved their food and for a period was my favorite place to go for a salad. Over a period of a few years (not specific) the quality of the salads has gone WAY down.... This was my experience again today. Where is the actual lettuce? I am eating the chunks at the bottom of a head of lettuce and more \"wilty\" lettuce than anything. People actually want the green leaves that make up a head of lettuce. I had a side salad and my friend had a Caesar salad. The only difference was the dressing and mine had 2 sad looking tomato slices. The rest of the food was and always has been great, but time for ownership/management to step it up on the salads."}
{"text":"Came in before the dinner rush. Staff all said hello..extremely friendly. Ordered salads and they were huge!!!! Three servings each...we took it home . All I ask if they can slice the tomatoes smaller on the bruschetta.. Great experience there..will be back."}

Yelp Review
Oregano's Pizza Bistro
1475 W Elliot Rd
Tempe, AZ 85284
(480) 966-0401
My fiancé and a few friends of ours were getting together for dinner and decided to go to Oregano's. This was not the first time I've ever been to Oregano's but it was my first time at this particular location. Our friends got there a bit early and were already seated by the time we got there, which is always a plus. The staff, from the front door to the server to our waiter were kind and welcoming, making our experience overall very pleasant. Our waiter checked on us periodically, but not too much where it felt like a bother. He made sure that we all had what we needed, our drinks were full, and our food was to our liking. 
The best part of our experience though had to be the food! Our friends ordered wings for an appetizer, which arrived quickly and looked delicious. Our friends proceeded to rave about how good they were. I am not a wings person myself, but have heard that the way they grill their wings and the rub they use is superior to many other wings. Our waiter then took our entrée orders and checked on us regularly until they arrived. I myself ordered the Big Rig pasta, which I have never tried before. It might have been the best pasta I have ever tasted. The dish had rigatoni noodles in a creamy tomato sauce with shredded chicken. It also had a little kick of spices which I wasn't expecting, but was pleasantly surprised. Overall, the food was absolutely divine! My fiancé, who always orders the Vino Bambino salad, tried my dish and even tried to convince me to trade dishes because the Big Rig was so good! Not to say that his Vino Bambino wasn't delicious, it most certainly was, but the Big Rig was simply top notch and definitely a dish I plan to order again in the future. Our friends ordered a pizza to share and were also very satisfied with their meal. 
The ambiance of Oregano's makes it a fun environment to sit and chat without being too loud, so even after our meals to done we stayed for a bit just to chat. The music played throughout the restaurant is upbeat music, seemingly from the 1950s era which transports you back to a simpler time. Our waiter was very courteous and didn't rush us to leave or pay our bill. Speaking of the bill, we had excellent food, excellent service, and even some food to take home for a reasonable price. I believe our total came to around $30 and we had no problem tipping 20% because the wait staff was very kind and helpful. Overall, I'm a loyal Oregano's fan. It is one of our families go-to restaurant for family events. But I have to say that this location might be my favorite simply because of the staff and wonderful experience we had there. We will without a doubt be back to this location and many other Oregano's throughout the valley soon."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong coming here. We LOVE Oregano's. Besides the GOOD food, it's just fun and we love the great atmosphere. We stop here when we're in the area."}
{"text":"You can never get enough of the creativity that this successful pizza chain delivers.  Although their prices have gone up slightly, it is still worth the waits that often occur at most of their locations.  Their Chicago deep dish or thin crusts are gigantic; and it's nice you can do half and half.  Pasta and salads are excellent especially their Beefsteak salad.   While sometimes their pizzas maybe a little salty, I ask the wait staff to tone it down. No wonder Arizona is now the pizza capital in the US; it's because of creative pizza made here.   The environment is entertaining with past memorability; the food looks as beautiful as the staff and the customers all for a great price."}
{"text":"Best Chicago pizza and the chicken wings are all drumsticks. My wife and I used to travel back to Chicago every year and we still couldn't find Pizza as good as Oregano's. I have to admit though: they might be growing too fast, the service has been slow the last several visits, the food took along time and the pizza was soggy, but I still give them a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Stuffed ourselves and still went home with a big box to go. Ordered the Vino Bambino the Bowl of Pasta with chicken. We couldn't have been happier. Service was excellent price was right. Proportion's are exceptional."}
{"text":"I've had many things on the menu here and ALL are spectacular. The pasta is always cooked perfectly with the right amount of sauce and other ingredients.  I really like how they have really spicy dishes . It's exciting to try them. They have PLENTY of drinks to choose from, and many classic mixed drinks so there is always something new to try. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We love this place! It is ALWAYS crowded for dinner - I don't care what night it is, so show up early unless you want to wait. The portions are huge, but don't let that keep you from adding meatballs to your Bolla Pasta because you can always take the leftovers home! The pizza is top notch too. My mouth is watering as I write this review... Oh, and the lasagna? Well worth the wait - just like the stuffed pizza!"}
{"text":"More can I say about Oregano's my first time at Oregano's was 5 years ago June 8th 2013 and it was awesome fantastic this location right on Dobson is awesome you got to sit at the bar talk with Ben Ben is the best bartender at Oregano's and he keeps you entertained you can't miss out on the abundance e of food and entertainment at this location.

He provides endless to suggestions for food and drinks and keeps you entertained all while you're sitting there at the bar I love this location the atmosphere and the people is just great.

You have to try the wings the best wings in the valley hands down not Long Wong's or native...

 These Wings Are the Best Wings hand down you can't beat them anywhere also I tried the sandwiches and the pieces are definitely on point best thing you need to get towards Italy or New York style pizza is right here at Oregano's.

Come in for the food stay for the entertainment and Hospitality enjoy this location as much as you possibly can and all the other locations."}
{"text":"Good staff, delish food and reasonable wait.... I love this spot!! My fave dishes are the alfredo in the dark (super yum!), the pablo picasso salad (not very healthy but its soooo good) and their pan pizzas! I also hear their golden wings are pretty good. Don't leave without the trying the adult rootbeer for a nice relaxing finish. Great food!"}
{"text":"Oreganos is awesome.  I've been to Oreganos dozens of times and never had a bad experience.  There is usually a decent wait at peak hours but nothing too crazy.  I think I waited an hour once but we had a party of 10 or so for my wifes birthday.  The food is always good and the price is great.  Oreganos has my favorite wings.  I recommend the hottest wings with their blue cheese.  They will burn your lips.  The sauce is very tasty.  I also recommend the thin crust pizza with tomato, jalapeño, basil, and pepperoni.  The crust is usually burnt just a enough to get the flavor and its always delicious.  My wife loves the macadamia cookie and ice cream dessert.  Its one of her favorites as well.  I also am a fan of their bellini.  While you wait you can try one and relax for a while.  For solid wings, pizza, dessert, drinks, and even the price you cant go wrong with any of the Oreganos locations.  Even that large party of 10 we had the bill was pretty close to a hundred."}
{"text":"Consistently good food. Not a bad thing on the menu. Two words BOOM DIP!!!  Stuffed pizza or thin crust. Both work perfectly. If you like wings, get the medium or golden. Either is an amazing experience. For those that like an adult beverage, go for the Bellini. For the finale save room for the pizza cookie. Holy yum. 

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I have given this location many chances and each time they have disappointed. Today I ordered a big salad as did someone else at our table and a portion of the salad was slimy and old. It ruined the entire salad giving it a rancid taste. In my experience they are not giving proper attention to the ingredients they are cooking with.The details are important... won't be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Great service, food,  and lots of choices. Large portions which we loved. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my wife and I love the food and drinks here. We have been coming here at least once a week and we like to sit at the bar so we can chat with others.  

That said, we are downgrading the review to 3 stars because the service is not good, especially at the bar. Even on nights when it's not very crowded, it seems like the bartender and his support are always too busy doing other things. We will sit at the bar and feel invisible for 5 to 10 minutes. 

We will probably continue to eat here because of the food, but we are hoping the manager reads this and makes some changes."}
{"text":"Lots of character, with oldies playing over head...

-Ordered Bristo Classic Pizza
-Stuffed Mushrooms

Service was quick n food came out fairly quick.
The stuffed mushrooms were amazing, bursting with flavor and oozing (yes, I said oozing) with cheese.
The Pizza was well balanced and the toppings were extremely fresh.  The crust was fine, but nothing super.  Yes, it was better than CPK pizza, but still not the best that I've had (in OC or Phx).  But perhaps that was the down fall.
Comparing to other greats ... puts this place at a disadvantage. But if I'm used to only CPK, then I'd be very impressed.

Don't get me wrong, this place has lots going for it and the overall experience was fun and super laid back yet with service that was awesome.  But compared to other pizza places eaten less than 24 hrs ago ... I'd say it isn't worth the long drive if you're coming from South of the 60."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in town! Their server, Tanna, gave excellent service! I will definitely be back to this location!"}
{"text":"We didn't even get pizza because it was going to be 75 minutes from the time we placed an order until they told us the pizza would be ready. 75 minutes! This is what's wrong with the world. Are you farming the ingredients?  We ended up going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Slow service.  Salads aren't like other Oreganos,  and the pizza takes FOREVER.  Let's go
 to Avondale."}
{"text":"After a long wait... I had the best stuffed pizza of my life. We waited about 45 minutes to get seated :-(....then the stuffed pizza takes 45 min. I didn't mind waiting for the pizza we knew it was gonna take that long. Absolutely the best stuffed pizza I have ever had, and I was told to try the cookie dessert. It is probably the best dessert I've ever had!!! No joke if you like cookie dough you would love it!! I will go there every time I come back to Az."}
{"text":"Sometimes there is such thing as too much of a good thing, in this case, greetings. Much like how Safeway grocery store now has this kind of forced pleasantries thing going, Oreganos is at it as well.

My coworker and I were greeted warmly by the nice host. Within the next two minutes, we were welcomed/greeted probably 23 times. I kept waiting to be asked if I was saved, or get a free copy of the watchtower. Please don't get me wrong, I love manners, they are great- like beer, but a little goes a looooong way.

My buddy and I order lunch, a couple of slices and cheesy garlic bread. I think I jinxed us, because I 'checked in' with my excitement about cheesy garlic bread, and the appetizer never arrived. 

Our lunch arrived, and as we scan the table discover there is no silverware, napkins, etc. After waiting a few minutes our server shows up and sees that we have made no forward progress, and brings us our silverware, and made a comment about forgeting the silverware. Totally cool, and I thought he addressed it, but no harm done. The server then asks if we ever got our appetizer, and we told him we did not. His reply would have made sense if I told him the sun would rise tomorrow, \"Oh.\" Kind of matter of fact, but there was no attempt at service recovery, or making it right. I would have been really pleased with a \"Oh, sorry about that.\" or \"Can I buy you guys dessert?\" etc. Nope, didn't happen.

It is a good spot, and they are insanely busy during lunch, but I think it would be good for them to remember to pay attention to details, it is important. 

The pizza was just ok, nothing to write home about. I think next time I will check out NYPD, they have great pie."}
{"text":"We ordered many things, but one thing that really bothered me is we had a 10 year old sitting at the table who really wanted dough.  I had to ask the server for dough.  She brought some really hard dough to the table and he could barely pull it apart.  It wasn't even on a platter.  I feel like it was old dough from another table.  We also ordered the zany ziti with the big rig sauce.   It came with NO big rig sauce, so we decided we would be nice and not say anything and order it on the side.  It never came.  We mentioned it, and the server told us she put it in.  It came as she was boxing our stuff up.  We didn't eat it because of this.  But she told us we could take it home, and she CHARGED us for it!!! We could not believe it.  I love this Oreganos, but the server took no responsibility for this issue, and she took complete advantage of us as nice customers.  I worked in the service industry for 5 years, and I would have totally comped it."}
{"text":"The food is good. Even the sandwiches. However recently something seems a miss. My big rig pasta was not up to par.  Noodles were doughy and chewy and clearly different sized than the old method. The chicken was in huge chunks vs the old shredded style.  Sauce watery but still spicy.  Disappointing since this is a place you are willing to wait for.  

Staff is also so young and distracted with one another at camelback location. You feel a bit like your cramping their style. They are busy gossiping and making their after work plans so when they turn to attend to you with the over the top smiles and same question they asked only moments ago, it's a little annoying. 

Kid friendly.  Long waits. But now inconsistent food... Drops a notch for me. 
I'll give it another try before I take these guys our of my rotation.  We usually get take out anyway."}
{"text":"Not a lot of vegan options. They were out of fries. 8-/blahblab labbalah. They have fortune cookies?"}
{"text":"Ohh, man!!   I've been to this place way too many times because it was hard for me to get Geno's Pizza in Chicago.  Every time I go to ASU, this is where I go.  The have the best thin crust pizza in the U.S. (again, besides my Chicago pizza)."}
{"text":"Our thin-crust pizza was incredible and the salad could have fed an army!!! Lots of delicious leftovers. Loved it."}
{"text":"Recently took a trip to this Oregano's location after a baseball game in Surprise. I've always had great experiences at Oregano's, and the food is always great. However the reason I give 3 stars to this location is the service I got from one particular employee. Miranda was curt and rude. Management would benefit by reviewing customer service with her."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm what can I say about awesome cheese bread and palate tingling marinara."}
{"text":"Gaucatony is yummy....anything Tony ending is yummy. Ate it before snapping a picture but, it looked and tasted great! Abby was an awesome waitress !! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Closest thing to Chicago stuffed pizza around! Great service, cool staff, check them out!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite restaurants in Arizona, hands down! This location was surprisingly not as busy at 4pm so we were able to get seated immediately. Food was awesome and so was our server! She was quick & prompt with bringing our food & drinks. Twas my first time trying the Chicago pan pizza & it was DELICIOUS! My friend & I also ordered the wings & side of fries which were yummy as well! So happy with this trip... Will definitely be back to this location! We left with food babies!"}
{"text":"The wait is insane, not sure why they didn't make this location larger. We were excited for it to open but rarely go because of the wait. Stuffed pizza,  chicken lasagna, original salad are the best. Colton was awesome,  ask for him!"}
{"text":"My nephew and I went to this \"Bistro\" yesterday around 3 pm and I was unbelievably disappointed. From the first encounter to the last it was all bad. I experienced bad attitudes throughout our meal. No one had genuine smiles on their faces and felt like I was a bother to most.
It all started with the hostess who did not seem as though she wanted to be there and you could tell by the scowl on her face. Our waiter showed up and did not introduce himself just asked if we were ready to order. It is my belief that you should ask people if they have been to an establishment and offer guidance with the menu if you are calling yourself a \"Bistro\". Maybe even talk about specials if you have them. So I order mimosa and ask if we could have a bit more time given this is your first time in. When my mimosa arrives I'm less than pleased with the amount of fluid I see in my glass and say to the waiter who delivered it that it looked a little light. He put his hands up, shrugs and walks away doing nothing about my dissatisfaction. He must have told the women bartender because she came out not to apologize for the drink and make another one but to sneer at me. At this point I should have walked out but I didn't.
Our waiter comes to take our order, we've decided to order the Chicago style pizza but he informed us it would take about 50 minutes to an hour so we declined and ordered the thin crust pizza on his recommendation. While we were waiting for our pizza we listen to the musical stylings of the hostess click her pen over and over and over again while she looks completely bored and uninterested in being there. Well 45 minutes later, our waiter comes by to tell us he has spoken to the manager the pizza would be out in an additional 5 minutes. Hmm I guess we could have ordered the Chicago style pizza after all. At this point I'm just ready for this to be over, so I do not complain. The pizza arrives and the flavor is not bad but for me it is a little runny and messy. 5 minutes after our food arrives I see the manager on her way over to our table and I'm thinking it's to see if we are ok given our food took over 50 minutes but this is not the case. It is to see if we wanted to have our pizza wrapped up to go! Well since I'm seated near the annoying hostess station (Looks like shift change because a new less than interested hostess is there clicking her pen now!) I know that there was a 10 top that needs to be filled so they wanted us to leave. About 3 minutes later our waiter does the same thing and I now concede. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone, just bad all around. Oregano's do better!"}
{"text":"We love Oregano's.  Best pizza in the Est Valley."}
{"text":"The wait was not long...great food...great service. My favorite place to eat everything is very good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend brought me here today for my first time and I am so glad she did. The excellent service we got from Chris and the rest of the staff combined with our food surpassing my expectations was enough for 5 stars. 

We walk in and the first thing I hear is everyone greeting us which sets the mood for the remainder of our time there. Then Chris introduces himself and explains to us that the Chicago Deep Dish pizzas take about 45 minutes to come out and the Thin Crusts take 20. We didn't have the time to wait so we went for a Thin Crust 16\" pizza and a salad. He was super friendly and refills were on point. The salad we ordered was huge! There was enough to pair with the pizza and then enough for me and my girlfriend to take to work for lunch the next day. Our pizza, which half was topped the way my girlfriend wanted and the other half my way, was delicious and Christ sprinkled a generous amount of grated parmesan cheese which was great. There was also plenty of pizza left to take home. 

To top it off we ordered Pizza Cookie which was a thick chocolate chip cookie baked in a 6\" pizza pan with not 2 but 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream. We have had many different variations of this dessert and the one from Oreganos has taken the #1 spot on our list.  

The food would of easily just earned 4 stars alone but as we were leaving all the staff again wished us a good night and the superb customer service at this place adds another for the 5 star rating. We will be coming back when we have more free time for a Chicago deep dish and another Pizza Cookie!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!   We HAVE Been Here A Few Times And We Bring Our Family And friends when they visit from out of state. Salads omg amazing and although it takes a while for their pizza, it's well worth the wait. Staff is friendly,  knowledgeable and so fun. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went tonight. Pleasant waitress. But wings came with only wings no drumsticks, pizza was delicious. Waitress gave us free pizzookie for the wing inconvenience, which came completely charred on the bottom. Not just a little burnt, but smelly burnt. Like I'd only feed it to my dog burnt, well if it didn't have chocolate in it."}
{"text":"Several years ago my Father and Stepmom used to take my sisters, brother and I out to Oregano's Pizza Bistro, the location off of Mill Ave. and University.  We would often walk to that location because it was just a few short miles through our old neighborhood.  Sadly after moving from Tempe to Mesa, our outings to the good ol' pizza joint happened less and less often.  It was soon just a comforting memory of sharing time, music and good food with my loved ones.  Recently Oregano's had been reintroduced into my life. I was meeting with my older sister for a bite, wanting to meet somewhere in the middle that night, my sister mentioned that an Oregano's had recently been built near her house, the Priest and Elliot location.  All of the old memories of going out with my family sharing the good food, music and company came dancing back in my head, I couldn't have imagined a better place to go!  I pulled up, the parking lot packed, which was no surprise (I vividly remember always waiting impatiently as a child to get a seat at the old location.)  My sister and niece had arrived first and had been seated on the patio.  Walking into Oregano's is like walking into a family member's house, warm cheery welcomes from everyone!  The hostesses were helpful and pointed me in the right direction to the patio.  The ambiance of the place had instantaneously put me in a great mood, lively music, outgoing personalities found in every employee, it felt like home!  Our waiter came up moments after I had gotten seated, suggesting and appetizer and offering me a beverage.  He was friendly and laid back, not talking to me as a customer he was serving, but rather a guest, a friend, in his own home.  I took his recommendations on the \"Dirty Monkey\" and \"Kick-butt Garlic Bread.\"  Both arriving promptly and were delicious.  The \"Dirty Monkey\" is an adult beverage which consists of sweet liquors and juices, it was definitely a tasty treat!  The \"Kick-butt Garlic Bread\" was huge!  Definitely a fair bargain for what you get!  My sister and I split the \"Big Rig Pasta\" which was the same thing we had always gotten in the past.  It was comforting to see it was still on the menu after all those years.  Once it had arrived we indulged in the creamy chipotle covered rigatoni noodles.  Topped with fresh basil and tomatoes, it was better than I remembered!  After over indulging I mentioned to my sister how it made me so happy to be there, and admiring everything about the restaurant.  Working in the food industry myself I confessed this wasn't like a normal restaurant, though I love where I work, this was different.  I felt as if I was among all friends and family, I felt at home.  A server must have over heard my statement and had dropped off an application at my table.  He was smiling and friendly and simply said \"You should work here if you're unhappy there.\"  This man wasn't the same waiter that had been helping us out that night, he had just been serving the other half of the patio.  I was caught off guard, and sort of laughed it off and the man walked away.  I couldn't help but play with the idea, though I knew it was almost impossible, I already had a job tending bar and serving at another restaurant, between that and school my availability was next to nothing.  Although the thought of working at a place like this was an entrancing one.  Overall the experience was just what I needed!  I am very pleased that Oregano's had come back into mine and my families lives.  Even more so pleased that they have stayed true to their roots, Lawrence Gibbilini's philosophy of life, which he was known to live by everday, \"The key to happiness is friends, good food and music.\""}
{"text":"If i could i would give it no stars. By far THE worst birthday ever. Server (Danny) lied to my sister about onions which she is allergic to. We were seated in a waiting area. Lied to over the over the phone and on site.  Told we'd get the patio. We were told to call ahead and they'd set something up for us, but we felt like we were just shoved in a corner. Will never return and will be letting anyone who is even thinking about coming to this location not to come."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I was so happy when we got the Glendale location. I have never once come here and not enjoyed myself. If it's your first time here, go with the Big Rig - best item on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you use yelp to check in..... don't use it.... if you have a big party for celebration, don't go here. The restaurant did nothing to help us as a large party of 15+ people. We checked in on yelp 30 minutes in advance (because restaurant policy does not take call ahead reservations), only to find out my name was not on the list, & you are unable to check in anything over 6. If you want decent food for a mediocre last minute date, I'd give this 5 stars. For taking visitors here for celebrations? Not ever again."}
{"text":"Love everything on the menu. You just can't go wrong here! The atmosphere is fun and the food is to DIE for!"}
{"text":"We have always loved the Oregano's on Camelback so decided to try the new site. Food and drinks were on par, but our server was terrible -- not coming back to take the rest of our order, not familiar with the menu, easily distracted, etc. And beware! The misters on the patio are more like \"soakers\"; the staff had to keep wiping down surfaces before people were able to sit down. The back of my daughter's shirt was drenched by the time we left. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have never written a review.  I eat out TONS and have a few choice restaurants I love.  I shop on Amazon like its my job... I read the reviews, but never actually review.  Having said that, I wanted to take the time to let people know what a wonderful experience I had Oreganos on Dobson.  I go to Oreganos all over the Phoenix Valley... Mostly Tempe on University and Phoenix on Camelback. I (generally) get the Big Beefstro Salad... Solid choice for those of you that have never experienced it... Ah-mazing.  Moving on... My server was Kim, she was DELIGHTFUL. Attentive, friendly, just all around a great server.  And the salad?  Best I ever had.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend Oscar, the salad guru in the back.  The most magnificent I've ever had it, ever!! My boyfriend got the Big Rig, and he can't stop comparing other rigatoni dishes to it; it, too, was far above the normal Oreganos deliciousness (which is already pretty up there).  Kudos to Kim and Oscar, job well done and thank you for making my experience so wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite spot. The atmoshere is awsome. Food is so delicous, its clean and the staff are very friendly. I recommend the cheesey garlic bread, pizza, wings and there is a good sandwhich but I don't remember the name. What i  remember best about this place is we ate outside and it was freezing. They of course had the heating lamps but they gave us blankets to use while we ate our dinner. I thought that was very cool. This place is always packed and they don't take reservations which sucks but would advise to go when its a time where people are at work so can get food faster and don't have to wait"}
{"text":"Freaking love the BBQ pizza and toasted ravioli. One of the best places to get a pizza in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix/Tempe for work and co-workers took me here for lunch.  Great patio and the indoor atmosphere is fun and casual.  Terrific chicken parm and friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"Love this place! The don't be Alfredo the dark and Picasso salad with chicken is my favorite! Service is always great as well as the food!"}
{"text":"The bruschetta is tasty and a great starter.

The Oregano's Salad (hold the olives) is just bomb. Order the small and it's enough for 3 adults.

We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza (added pineapple) and it was tasty. The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh, and it's not greasy.

The servers are upbeat, fast, and knowledgeable.

The menu is kind of huge and you can skip over things easily, but do NOT miss the warm cookie pie for dessert.

PS - if you are cold and sitting outside, ask for a blanket...they've got them!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant! From the hostesses, to the bar, to the server all the way to the management (or lack there of) this place left a very poor first impression on me, and the 25 other people I dined with.
The bar is incredibly small and they aren't able to make very many specialty cocktails because the \"only carry the essentials\". Thats okay, Ill stick with the wine and beer myself.
My group started to arrive around 6:45, we understood it was busy and might be a wait, but a good rule of thumb is to over exaggerate a wait time as a hostess, not tell the party they'll be seated in 5min and then not seat them for an additional 20min.
Once we were seated, our server did not take long to come over and start our drink order, but he was clearly less than enthusiastic about serving our party, yes we were a big group and a little rowdy at that, but if you cannot handle a big party, DONT TRY! It took nearly 25min for us to get our drinks after we ordered them. We ordered two bottles of wine, which our server did not feel inclined to pour them for us, infact i was surprised he even opened the bottle for us at all. After dropping off our drinks (half of us decided to try and order from the bar because our drainks were taking so long) it took an additional 20min before our server even took our food order. In the menu I didn't realize that with the \"Alfrado after dark\" you had the choice of meatballs, sausage, or chicken so when he asked i hesitantly said \"sausage please\" and he rudely responded \"What? is that a question for me\" I simply didn't realize i had the choice. Our food took close to half an hour to arrive (understandable i suppose, we were a large group) At this point it was about 9:45pm when the food started rolling out and man I was hungry!!! I patiently wait while all the food came out and about 5min went by and finally our server came over and i asked for utensils, super excited to eat my pasta, i scooped up a heap of noodles and low and behold apparently i ordered pasta salad because my food was ice cold! I informed my server of this, he was very unapologetic and offered to get me a new one, unfortunately it was 10pm at this point and I no longer wanted to be eating pasta this late and I had a 40min drive ahead of me. The girl sitting next to me asked for her check before the food came because she had to go, it took him 20min to bring her check.
it was a poor experience!!! I never enjoy spending 3 1/2 hours in a restaurant when most of it is waiting. 
I will try another location with a smaller group, because I have heard amazing things about the food, this location and this occasion unfortunately dropped the ball."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good. I'd go back again when I am in the area. The place was super busy and there was a long wait for tables but the service was fast and efficient even with how busy they were."}
{"text":"Stopped in several weeks ago with out of town guests. The service was spot on. 

Our table ordered a mix of pizza and pasta dishes. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food. 

My only complaint was the pizza crust. Maybe I am not a fan of the paper thin crust. I was sort of hoping for something a little more substantial. 

The food was of good quality for a chain restaurant. 

I wish the owners the best of luck with this new location."}
{"text":"Always delicious food! The wait is long on weekend evening soooo definitely add yourself to the waitlist before getting there. It's super helpful."}
{"text":"Oregano's is always good value for your money. I usually order the thin crust pizza, there Supreme style pizza. That's not the name but your typical Supreme style pizza. It's good. Also, they're Bellini's are really good. Yum. This place is not cheap, but it is good"}
{"text":"I was told about this place and so I had to check it out for myself. Walk in greeted and got seated right away. 
When the waiter came over he let us know the food could be spicy. I wasn't sure I was going to be able to eat as my stomach does it handle spicy so well. So I asked the waiter about a few thing on the menu that I could eat and I settled on the spaghetti. My husband and I share to Caesar salad. I would of like more dressing on it and I should of asked for more. 
Over we had a great time and would go back."}
{"text":"We were in town for a Cub's game and seeking a Chicago pizza.  The reviews for this place sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.  We had about a 30 minute wait which was a good sign!  The stuffed mushrooms were a delicious starter.  We added a house salad and a large thin crust pizza and had a wonderful meal.  We were disappointed when told that the stuffed pizza would take an hour.  We would have ordered when we put our name in, if we had known.  That is what we will do the next time we visit."}
{"text":"We came here for an office dinner. We had 20 people for dinner on a Friday night at 7pm.... the wait was 45 minutes which is far better than other places we have gone such as Dave and Busters (2 hour wait) and Bennihanas (1.5 hour wait)... the food was amazing, the waitstaff was efficient, accurate, and friendly. The best part was with the reasonable prices even with 20 adults we didn't have to break the bank. I would recommend this place to anyone. I love many items here but my favorite is the Italian stuffed grinder. (Or sub sandwich as I guess some people call it)... and a must have is their pizza cookie.  The only downside is their parking situation. Be prepared to park and walk since their actual parking lot fills up fast."}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing. The wait for a table was crazy long and the only complaint I had is that we called ahead of time when we were on our way to get on the list and the girl that answered refused to put us on the list over the phone. Otherwise great experience."}
{"text":"Finally was able to come here since it opened, and it definitely lives up to the Oregano's standard or great food and great service! The portions are huge, the ice tea is good, and the atmosphere is great!

Went at lunch time and had fabulous service from Debbie and was checked up on numerous times by the manager. 

If you want a lot of food and a fun atmosphere this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Oregano's is always a family go-to! The atmosphere is always great! Ryan was our server and was amazing! We didn't have to ask for much! He had the kitchen staff cut out garlic cheese bread, brought extra napkins, plates, and had a welcoming attitude! Request Ryan! :)"}
{"text":"Oregano's is a chain of pizza restaurants in Arizona. There always seems to be a wait to be seated. The food is pretty good. They have different kinds of thin crust pizzas. They also have a variety of salads and other entrees. However, the food is good it's not amazing. The service can be hit or miss on a busy night. This location seems like it is extra loud, maybe it's due to the smaller space. Anyways, the best thing they have is dessert.. You have to save room because the pizza cookie is that good!"}
{"text":"Got a large pizza and garlic bread with cheese, it was very good.  We live in Chicago and take our pizza very seriously and they were seriously.  This is definitely a repeat.  We were there on a Saturday nite and there was a long line for dinner and glad we called and picked up our order to bring home"}
{"text":"Yes its a chain but for the money, this place is one of the best chain restaurants if not the best I know of.  The wait staff is great and good looking and the food is awesome and priced well."}
{"text":"This is a fun spot that offers good food, service and fair price point. 

Lunch specials are plentiful and you can get in and out pretty quick. Last week my co-worker and I ordered take out and they did an awesome job of packing it up and didn't miss anything. Well done Oregano's!"}
{"text":"We have eaten there at least 25 times. Always good! Today is national lasagna day and we decided to pick some up around 2pm, take it home and keep it warm until dinner.  We also ordered meatballs which were good.
The lasagna was horrible! It was like a spicy meat loaf. We ate the meatballs and threw the lasagna out
We'll stick to the Pablo Picasso Salad and Numero Uno Pizza.
Oreganos! Y
Ou need to rethink your Lasagna recipe!!!"}
{"text":"I was here while working in Phoenix and I have to tell you it's probably one of the best Italian places I been to! Their salads are huge and delicious and the pasta was omg one of the best ones I had! The garlic bread was crispy and buttery but not overly garlicky!!! Definitely coming back!! Also their customer service was great!!"}
{"text":"Holy cannoli!! Their serving sizes are huge!! It was my first time there. I ordered the antipasto salad and I could only eat half. It tasted great. I also got to try their very deep dish pizza (lunch size). Overall the food was good. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I recomend the Antipasto salad and bbq chicken pizza and the roasted rosemary potatoe pizza."}
{"text":"Yeah Oreganos is not even on my radar after the last couple visits.  These wings are pathetic little puny whimps of what was once the biggest baddest all drums of a former life.  The rest of the food went down hill too.  The guacatony gauc was shrunk and not fresh.  The bartender ran out of belinis.  4 of our 6 plates still had food on them from the previous customers.  YUCK!

What a shame.  The owners really ruined a gem.  They can open up a million more of them.  But I for one will no longer be supporting this chain with the changes they have made in product and quality.  

RIP Oreganos.  You once were great."}
{"text":"It was a nice experience!  Generous portions and wasn't over priced.  The wait time was long and I think they should serve bread if the orders take as long as I experienced.  Increase the quality of their garlic bread too, that was served with the meal.  Parking was a pain.  The inside was nice.  Very geared toward families."}
{"text":"Hand's down, Oregano's is our favorite pizza joint in all of the Phoenix area. We have eaten at several, however the new Cave Creek location is nearest to our home. We tend to go \"off hours\" or before the rush times, never having to wait more than a couple minutes for a table. The pizza, of course, is superb and the wait staff here is great. They are always friendly and easy to visit with.We went on my birthday in Oct and  I had no idea there was a \"birthday cookie\". Susan(waitress) brought out this incredible, warm, freshly baked 6\"-8\" cookie with melting ice cream on top and needless to say, after eating most of a medium pizza, I made room for the cookie....yes, I shared with my wife....We love the pizza so much here, we find it difficult to order anything else off the menu!"}
{"text":"Well, everyone knows that all Oregano's locations have excellent food and music!!

This was my first visit to this particular location. It will NOT be my last! In fact, I think it's my new secret hangout! (well, not now that I've told all of you!)

The patio in the back is just enough removed from the hustle bustle of Camelback that you feel like you're completely out of the fray. This is accomplished with Oregano's signature ambiance. Lights, trees, murals, best music ever!

I can't wait for my next visit. Oh, and EVERY SINGLE employee we encountered was happy, engaged and pleased to please us! AND the place was clean! (which is a big plus in my book!)"}
{"text":"Decent for lunch, i usually do not have a lot of time, and it feels like anything other than a salad takes forever. 

I"}
{"text":"Mmmmm.... Bollo Pasta is my fav dish here (Angel Hair Pasta, made with Oregano's own \"spicy\" marinara sauce). Only thing is that I wish it came with more marinara sauce, a bit dry without it. Plus, meatballs cost extra, it would be nice to have them include it, even if it cost a little more. But this dish never seems to fail me with my side house salad. 

Bistro Calamari is a bit small in portion, and a bit greasy, just ok. Lots of leftovers from the pasta for some midnight hunger pains! Would like to come back for some pizza though."}
{"text":"I travel to Chicago nearly every month, and love their deep dish pizza. This is the closest I've found in Scottsdale to real Chicago pizza.   I had their Uncle Ray's sausage & mushrooms. They really have nailed the sausage. That is exactly what Chicago sausage (Giordano's) tastes like. 

Serve was very friendly and fast. Gave me a to go iced tea. Couldn't ask for any better service. 

Just need to allow for the extra time needed for a deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"Won't go back.. server talked to us like we were dumb and made me so angry I didn't even order the food. I asked to pay for the app I hadn't gotten and to just leave. It started off good with the super friendly hosts and then it was down hill from there. I asked for just Alfredo and pasta. The waitress claimed that they couldn't take any veggies out and that it was pre made. I literally got it not a month ago. And when I mentioned this and just asked what had changed so I could move on she told me she didn't know what to tell me and that's how it was. Really? Being someone who works in the serving industry I was horrified."}
{"text":"I think my fellow Oreganymphos would agree; this is single handedly one of the greatest places on earth to gorge yourself with some of the most delicious pizza, pastas and desserts AZ has to offer. 

If you wanna take my word for it, dont even look at the menu and order my usual orgasmic order:

Appetizer: Calimari
Dinner: Big Rig Pasta w/ Chicken 
Dessert: White Chocolate Chip Macadamian Nut Pazookie

FYI: Whenever your taste buds feel like going on a culinary roadtrip, make sure you hit up any of the various Oregano's locations located around the state; my personal favs are the Flagstaff and Tucson locations."}
{"text":"This is the best go-to Italian restaurant in the state. Not only does it have phenomenal pizza, but everything else is great including their wings (a place most people didn't even know they had wings). Their salads, sandwiches, and pasta dishes are made to perfection. Get to Oregano's now if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Stuffed crust pizza and boom dip is the only way to go.  Always delicious.  Have had inconsistencies with pasta and sandwich options in regards to quality, quantity and value.  Stick with 2 standouts from above and you'll have 4-5 star meal.  Most other meals have ranged from 1-3 stars.  Wait list is an issue too.  Upon arrival was told it would be 25 minute wait and hostess asked for cell phone number to text when table ready.  Went to the bar had a couple drinks. Checked phone 30 min later only to discover had missed her text for table ready 5 minutes after we walked in the door.  Do not stare at my phone or jack up volume in public.  Would guess this has happened to others."}
{"text":"After trying it twice, I am not a fan of the marinara sauce. There is just something about it that ruins the whole pizza for me.  Service is ok.  I don't have much reason to go back.  Also, for me, it is overpriced."}
{"text":"Awesome new location.  I love the new Oregano's.  The food was great and our server was okay.  We celebrated a birthday and it is a great place for birthday parties.  I'll be back, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Usually a huge fan of this place, in fact it's one of the only chain restaurants I'm a big fan of but tonight was pretty disappointing. Food was good, service was terrible. Feeling rushed the 35-40 minutes we were there was not very accommodating. I had to ask 3 times to give us a few minutes to look at the menu, this all being in the first two minutes we were there. Dinner came and as soon as our plates were delivered we were asked if we were going to have a pazooki and what kind so our server could put in our order right away. Even after saying we wanted to eat our dinner first she insisted on putting it in because it takes 10 minutes. I actually like to enjoy my food and the people I'm with when going out to eat. The whole experience was rude. Will not be back at this location again."}
{"text":"I've been told that this is one of my friend's and her husband's favorite place to dine. In fact, they had been here the week before I arrived in Phoenix. It had been a while since having Italian fare, so I was happy to check things out here.

Oregano's pizza Bistro restaurant is a quaint little place that reminds me of being at either Chilis or Buca Di Beppo Italian cuisine restaurant - at least how the restaurant space is conveniently set up. We arrived here on a nice Thursday just after 12:20pm after a morning of shopping and errands. There wasn't that much activity here, but it took a while for the food to be presented to us. While everything looked and tasted well, wish it would have been expertly prepared in a quicker fashion. It must have been around 20-25 minutes after ordering before the food arrived. I realized that perfection takes time, but I guess it's better than overlooked and overlooked pasta! It felt longer than it was, maybe. The ambiance here was very much casual and quiet. Really like this kind of ambiance especially when you hit a certain age and need that quiet time away from life. Lol I did enjoy this place, even though the wait time was a tad slower than I thought.

The overall experience here at Oregano's pizza Bistro restaurant was good and nice. We actually got a booth near the entrance and there was nice air conditioning, especially nice when the temps were in the 90's outside. I can believe that summer time out here in the desert can get hot hot and toasty for sure! Oregano's Pizza Bistro is located at 7215 E Shea Blvd, in Scottsdale, Arizona. They accept major credit cards, so that's always a great thing! They have ample parking options, considering that they are in a strip mall and have plenty of neighboring merchants to support them. I really wished I did get the pizza though, but the prices were kind of high for that. I opted for the cheaper $10 option of the lasagna, which ended up decently good. I haven't had good lasagna in a while, so this meal really did hit the spot. The taste was good and delicious, although not mind blowing great. It hit the spot after an afternoon of shopping and walking around. Oregano's Pizza Bistro is clean and well managed. Definitely well worth the trouble of getting here.

I didn't take photos of the food, menu, and others because my iPhone decided to die on me just before we entered the restaurant. Needless to say, that it would have been better with photos though. Lasagna in a hearty meat sauce, along with 2x of Diet Coke makes this meal extra special. Too bad that I was driving, but i would totally have had at least one beer or something with the meal. Oh well. This was just lunch and I'm sure that this place is probably Rocking at dinner time! The service here was very nice and friendly. The best kind I'd say. Makes life worth living, if being served with a smile. I guess the wait was worth it. The server was nice and gave me my refill of Diet Coke without me asking for a refill. That's service right there. Thanks to my Scottsdale friends for bringing me here to this place and hanging out with me on my vacation to Phoenix, AZ and the surrounding communities.

4.0 stars for the lasagna. 4.0 stars for the ambiance and the service. I realize that I was on vacation, so waiting is a virtue. Way better than being stuck at the office.

Support local!

{"text":"The portions are MASSIVE.
But the food is honestly so good, that I wasn't even bothered by it. And the prices are super reasonable!  
I had the Ziti with green peppers and sausage and I loved it. The sausage was cooked to perfection and had a really great smoky flavor.
The decor is also really cool. They have vintage tvs, and vintage bikes and such and it's definitely neat to look at.
I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke, why the good reviews? Ordered a deep dish \" Chicago pizza\" as they call it. Completely wrong, wrong way to make chicago deep dish. I saw other reviews of to much grease, it's not grease they just don't know what they are doing it's a tone of olive oil. You cant even eat it. They even ran out of kahula. Hilarious waitress are clueless."}
{"text":"My experience at Oregano's was awful. We waited for our appetizer for 20 minutes: it was bread. Bread does not take that long. Then it took 50 minutes for our food to even get here in the first place. 

Our food was cold and the waitress wasn't even remotely sorry about it when we told her. Literally didn't even say sorry.

When asked to speak to the manager, the manager came to us and offered to make us new entrees. By that time, our appetites were gone.

I am disgusted with how we were treated. It is unacceptable to treat paying customers- or people In general- this way. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Will never come back again. Wyatt was awful and the manager was just as incompetent! Came on a Monday night- you wouldn't think an order would take so long.
Update- the managing partner contacted me and was very apologetic about the service. That's nice that they take reviews and customer service seriously."}
{"text":"Decided to take some of my hippie friends here and treat them to some Real Big Salads. They live nearby and had not been here before. Plus a little fiber never killed anyone ... right?

I've always liked this particular pizza chain and this location is just like the others. They have all the similar do-dads hanging on the walls and the menu is gigantic.

Ordered my favorite Rib Eye Salad in the biggest size they have. They call it The Big Beefstro Salad on the menu and it is really good. The dressing has a sweet Serrano Pepper flavor going on and it is pretty spicy. This one was so big I had to bring some home for later.

My friends ordered the Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad and it was giant. They also were excited about the size and had to ask for a box for the leftovers as well.

Service was very friendly and we experienced several greetings. They even opened the doors as we both entered and left the building. We were surprised by the large amount of take out orders that were waiting for people to pick them up.

Looking forward to trying out some pizza again and possibly checking out their famous all Original Pizza Cookie with Ice Cream. Dang it looked scrumptious and would definitely ruin my girlish figure. MAMA MIA!

4 STARS"}
{"text":"I love Oregano's and probably one of the better things that I can say is that one location is as good as the next.  I've probably been to Oregano's upwards of thirty times and I've not had a bad experience yet.  The lines outside of any of their restaurants should be a solid indicator of their quality.  Good pizza is hard to find out here in Phoenix, I've tried many and other than Rosati's I've really not been very impressed.
Maybe when my tax check comes I'll take four hours and visit Pizzeria Bianco :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Andrew is awesome!  Daniel was our server tonight he was happy and was very interested if we were happy customers!  Great job team Andrew and Daniel!  Even if the food sucked we would eat here because you guys care!  Bonus is you both rock and the food is amazing and they cater to Our Vegan way of eating."}
{"text":"My visit was awesome. I went on a Saturday afternoon and immediately got seated after 15 minutes of waiting. 

I went with my friend and we ordered:
-A glass of white wine
-Frozen Bellini
-Zani ziti
-Alfredo's artichoke lasagna 
-Chocolate chip pazookie

All of it was awesome. The white wine was sweet. The Bellini was strong and sweet. It was really delicious! The lasagna was bomb! I was nervous about trying a white lasagna but I was very satisfied because I prefer white sauce pastas anyways. The part that made me most nervous was the artichokes. It was a good compliment. It gave it a tart flavor. The pasta wasn't mushy. It was al denté! Yay! The pazookie was magical. I'm pretty sure I had an outer body experience. 

The price was extremely reasonable for the quality of food that we had. We paid approximately $45 for all of that food. 

The are a few things I would suggest. Tidy up the bathrooms because they weren't clean. The layout of the restaurant is awkward. Why is the bar so small? Why is there a spot at the bar where you stare at the wall? That's no fun! It's small in this restaurant too.

Overall I think I'd come back. I like the food. :)

EL FIN!"}
{"text":"I moved here last December and so far this is my favorite pizza spot.  I had the thin crust (whole wheat) chicken pesto pizza and it was amazing!!  I love pesto.  And there have been a couple occasions where my friends and I have gone just for the pazooki's!! I have tried many of the warm cookie w/ ice cream desserts in the past but nothing else compares to Oregano's Pazooki!!
One time my pizza came messed up and the staff was amazing about making up for it.
Warning if you are in a hurry save Oregano's for another time because there pizzas do take a long time but are well worth it."}
{"text":"While I would normally rate this restaurant with five stars, this week's experience was so disappointing that I writing to warn other patrons.  I had surgery Monday and was in pretty poor shape.  The following day friends offered to bring me dinner and the thing I craved more than anything else was an Oregano's Favorite Salad.  

My friends ordered take out and brought dinner to my home.  Much to my disappointment, instead of the amazing salad I usually enjoy when eating at the restaurant, I got a container of iceberg lettuce with a smaller container of shredded chicken.  NONE of the normal ingredients (other that then iceberg and the chicken) were on the salad.  It was awful, if the iceberg had been missing literally nothing else would have been in the container.  

Needless to say we were all very disgruntled, but given my post-surgery state, no one was able or wanted to drive all the way back to the location to get them replaced.  We all ordered the same salad and all received the same lackluster container of lettuce.  Sooooo disappointing - I will never again order take out from this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Oreganos locations in Tempe and in Scottsdale, so I knew we liked them and was excited for this one to open. We're pretty neglected out here on the far west side. 

My four kids and I arrived at 2:10. On the way in I eyed the patio and was happy to see three clean tables. Awesome, no wait.  Just kidding! Quoted a 40 minute wait, we decided to take a menu anyway and argue over pizza options in the wait area. That was a good plan because we were seated and our order put in about 20 minutes later. We were warned our deep dish could take an hour, but I didn't worry about it because we'd ordered a sandwich and a thin crust to work on while we waited. And waited. And waited. Looking around, I continued to notice 3-4 tables open on the patio. It was never completely filled, but the outside wait area continued to be packed. 

By this time it was 2:59. I grabbed our server (don't remember who she was but she was lovely) and asked for garlic bread and a couple of soups. We were ready to eat our fingers by this time. We'd been out running errands and hadn't eaten since breakfast. She said she would put the order in to come out right away. 

We wait some more. One of the kids asks if maybe we should just give up and go home. I didn't check the time this time, but it was approximately 20 minutes before we got some soup and bread. One of the bowls was little more than broth and the other was nothing but fill (pasta and meat...it was wedding soup), which I thought was oddly done, but it was fine. I just transferred a bit of soup back and forth with a spoon to restore the balance. The flavor was very good and it disappeared all too quickly because we were back to waiting again. 

At 3:53, I texted my older daughter that we wouldn't be home for a while since we were still waiting for our lunch to arrive. Around 4pm, the food arrives and I'm underwhelmed. It's sad looking. A little bit dry. A little bit cool...not ice cold, but not fresh out of the oven. Like it's been sitting there a while. I give up. 

So to their credit, they did realize there was a problem. They checked the ticket and realized we  had been sitting there for over an hour and a half. They removed the thin crust from the bill and then offered to send it home with me anyway. I thought about it for a second but didn't really feel right about taking it. They offered us free dessert, which was very kind but I was tired and my six year old was squirrelly and not even a free pizza cookie could entice anyone to stay. When I got the bill, I noticed they'd comped a bit instead. So I was happy with the service, but walked away feeling like there is some serious weirdness happening in the kitchen. 

I'd like to come back in maybe six months when they get the kinks worked out. Maybe hire more kitchen staff? Is there just one guy back there or something? Anyway, if I brave the wait times, I'll come back to update. If you go, be sure to carve out a half a day!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. It also has great prices. The staff is pretty nice, the only knock would be the wait times. Had a party of 8 and had to wait about 2 hours. I think if they did reservations, it would offset some ridiculous wait times, because they can get pretty busy, and there seems to be nothing the host/hostess is able to do. The long wait drained me and took away from the experience, however the food was still recognizably great, and no complaints about it. Had the thin crust with a few apps, spinach dip (boom dip) being the main one, and I must say one of the better spinach dips..."}
{"text":"Oregano's always results in overeating.  This used to be my thing and I sometimes find myself falling off the wagon.  Oregano's certainly helps.

Everything here is big: the menu, the portions, the wait for a table.  The actual restaurant itself is rather small and split across two structures with a meager parking lot in the middle.  The Phoenix location has a more sensical layout, but is just as crazy busy.  We also call it Gaytalian, whereas the Scottsdale location is just Italian.

My one recommendation is to not get an appetizer.  The garlic bread is massive and gooey, the guacatoni is guacalicious and the fried ravioli are just the right abuse of a deep fryer.  However, if you do get a starter you will never get to dessert still able to consume food.  Remember those big portions?  The meal will do you in and you will miss the best part of Oregano's - The Pizookie.  It's a cookie that's not fully baked and topped with ice cream.  You should try all three flavors: Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter Chocolate, and White Chocolate.

Oh, yea.  The main food.  The lasangas are stellar, specifically the artichoke one.  The salads are the weak spot, but the meatball sub had four bulldozer-sized soft meatballs.  I usually go for the deep dish pizza stuffed with unending amounts of cheese, but the flat pizzas have more variety and work well to share.  That's the big thing here.  Share or risk massive waist expansion.

And if you care to drink, you need to have a bellini.  It's a frozen drink of wonder and has schnapps, rum, wine, and champagne.  It's like the whole bar in one glass.  

It's important to recognize that going to Oregano's is an event and will take time.  However, with the friendly servers, the constant access to beverages, and the cool Chicago Italian decorations, you won't mind the time."}
{"text":"I was suggested by a lot of locals to come to Oregano's Pizza. We went on a Wednesday night and the wait was 30minutes. The parking lot was quite full and we had difficulty finding parking.

The staff members were really nice. On my way to the restroom, I had at least 6 people who greeted me during my short walk and pointed me towards the restroom. Our waitress was nice as well but she told us our salad was going to take 5 minutes but it came out with our pizza 30minutes later. Wah wah. My mom and sister even told her we were hungry. I think that just might have thrown them into hangry mode. 

We had the pineapple stuffed pizza. I've had chicago pizza and they TRY to mimic them. Close but no cigar. Nevertheless, it was filling and descent. I definitely prefer the Bistro Classic, garlic sauce based thin crust pizza. It was much more flavorful.

Weird note: they have bunch of fortune cookies at the front. wth?"}
{"text":"Came here after listening to my buddy's recommendation, and boy was I surprised! As we entered it truly feels like we warped into another dimension where crazy is the norm. They have paddle boards, cans, old portrait, books, and many other miscellaneous items placed everywhere...  but hey... it works! The front clerk had a very cheerful additude which helped alleviate with the wait. 15 minutes later of classy soft jams we were seated and ready to order!

Jenny our waiter was extremely friendly she really helped me decide what to order, so I was expecting to have a fantastic time. Then 30 minutes elasped, in my mind I'm thinking good food takes time to make... until we started to see other tables that sat after us get their entrees and others that finished. Another 15 minutes passed now I'm starting to wonder if they forgot our order... Argggg, it turns out that's exactly the case!  I was appalled when Jenny our server attempted to play it off like it's was not her fault... Thankfully, the manager noticed that something had gone awry and gave us a free appetizer.  Still stumped that Jenny had the audacity to treat us like a bunch of mindless meatheads, and worst of all she didn't even apologize for the mistake. 

Kickbutt Garlic Bread, (4.99 + .89) Came out nice and toasty. Not much to say, I'd be shocked if anyone messes up toasting garlic bread. That said, tasted like garlic bread with cheese. 

Zany Ziti, hard breaded bowl outer shell with 4 cheese and pasta (8.99). Great presentation and portion size, but the pasta did not tasted fresh, and the breaded bowl was so hard it's virtually inedible. What a shame! If only they used fresh pasta and not overbaked the breaded bowl this dish could easily be one of my favorites.

Stuffed Riga Tony with Meatballs (9.89). OK this time they done the meatballs justice, very juicy and just the right amount of salt. Perfecto! The tubular rigatoni also delivered, it had perfect harmony of cheese and tomato sauce, neither overpowering the other. Overall this dish is Magnífico!

Original Pizza Cookie, chocolate chip + ice cream on top. Cookie was super soft and chewy complimented with scoops of creamy ice cream that brought a smile to my face. 

Service 1/5
Taste 3/5
Value 5/5
Overall 3/5

Man! What a rollercoaster ride, started off very rocky and persisted throughout the course of the meal. Our service was a disaster, hopefully it's just one bad seedling. Im sure on their A game this place is the place to be, but for now as is... it's a risk I'm not willing to take.

Pro tip: order less, their entrees are large enough to satisfy two people!"}
{"text":"After returning find vacation in Italy, I was dying to find a pizza that came close to their original pizza in Rome. I was so happy to find oreganos!! The Aunt Margherita Pizza was amazing, very close to the in Italy!! Also highly recommend Clark Street and the Huge Guaca-Tony! Be prepared to wait, everything is made fresh and it is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"We went here because a friend chose it for her birthday.
We had a large group, 15 I think, and it was a Friday, and they don't take reservations, so it was a poor choice on that friends behalf.

We were quoted an hour and a half wait.  We waited, and waited, and waited.   We were seated about 2 and a half hours later.

While we were waiting a woman who I assume was a manager took our order so that we wouldn't have to wait for the food once seated.

We still waited, apparently she forgot to tell the waitress exactly what was going on and took off.  Appetizers came out with meals, stuff took forever.

And the food, not even worth it.

Our waitress was a gem though, completely got stuck with a screwed up situation that management and the hostesses should have handled better.  She did her best to make up for the crap start to the night."}
{"text":"Oregano's is awesome... from their pizzas to their salads to the pizza cookie (which I am usually too stuffed to order).  If you're in the mood for a drink with your meal, their peach bellini is fantastic."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed about how this restaurant blossomed. I have been going to Oregano's for about 5+ years now and have always been satisfied with my food and the friendly service. 
This last trip though was not the case!!
We arrived a little later around 9:15 so of course they were upset that we came into eat around closing time, but deal with it. Your restaurant says open until 10pm. I am sorry I got hungry at 9. 

The host sat us with a younger girl and she just was so unsure of her own capabilities it made us uncomfortable. We ordered the calamari and a couple sides of sauce that I have been doing for years and she looked at me like I was crazy. I repeated what I wanted and she scampered off to figure it out. After that I ordered a Pablo Picasso salad which has also been my favorite for 5+ years. The salad came and I had a few bites and was really not impressed! It seems as if Mark expanded his chain and forgot to hire people to carry the quality of the founding restaurants to the new locations he has opened. The chicken was watery, the salad dressing was sparse, the tomatoes were not fresh and I was disappointed. 

I don't live in AZ anymore, but was born and raised here, and when I come back to visit like this last time, I actually take my time to seek this restaurant out it used to be that good. Needless to say I will not seek it out again and am really sad that I have to mark it off my favorites list. 

The gilbert and university locations have always proven flawless, and it could just be this location, but I was really bummed with the outcome."}
{"text":"Omg!!! Freaking delicious!!! The artichoke cheese deep is the best I have ever had and the bread that comes with HOLY CRAP it should be illegal  The wait staff is not only gorgeous but courteous and attentive"}
{"text":"Two items that I LOVE, Pizza Cookie and Pablo Picasso Salad.  Otherwise don't bother going.  Yes its crowed, yes the parking is a pain, yes the food is amazing.  If a place is crowed there is a good reason for it!  The food is good, and people like the ambiance.  They have tons of outside seating which in Arizona is like 8 months out of the year a good choice.  If you don't want to wait 30-60 minutes don't go after 5PM on a Friday or Saturday otherwise what did you expect?  This place gets crowded even for lunch so try and go at odd hours really early before or right at 11AM for lunch, no later than 5:30PM for Dinner.  I take all out of visitors to Oreganos because I love it so.

PS if you try and park in their parking lot you are idiot and you deserve the hassle it causes what do you expect with 4 spots?  Seriously?   Park on the side streets people!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about our experience at Oregano's tonight. Our family of 4 came in and we were told it'd be about a 30 minute wait. We agreed to wait but we were then quickly offered immediate seating at their family friendly bar. We were immediately greated by Taylor. She was probably one of the best servers we have had. My husband and I dine out often and have had a lot of great experiences but this was one of the best. They were super accommodating. The manager, Sean, even offered our daughter a free cookie because he knew she had a rough day. Thank you east Mesa Oregano's!!"}
{"text":"This place deserves way better ratings. The food is amazing!!!! Yeah it may take a while but have some patience going out people!!!!!! The kitchens in these places aren't the biggest and they are always packed so expect to wait! It's worth it. The Guacamole appetizer, mama Mia Mexican salad, & steak salad are the best!!! Gotta finish with a pizzookie !! :)"}
{"text":"My sever was Julian H. He was very attentive and friendly. Always made sure we were well taken care of. Definitely made the dinner experience enjoyable. He recommended the baked ziti, if you are extremely hungry get this. It will fill you up. The Moscow Mules are phenomenal too!! Definitely will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Oreganos, but my last visit had a couple things I didn't like. It started out good. We got seated right away and the staff was really friendly. Then we ordered and I got the Zani Ziti bread bowl. When it arrived, it looked good and it tasted good. The manager came by and asked how it was and we said good. After eating half of the pasta and finally getting to the bread bowl, I realized the bread part was black and burnt, so I couldn't even eat the bread. I didn't want to complain or say anything about it because I already ate half of it so it'd look weird because I already ate part of it. But that was my fault. Our waiter tried to get us to get 3 pizookies and we were like no we can't eat that much so we just ordered one. So the experience was good until the end. We paid for the bill and we literally waited probably 20-30 minutes for our check and then we asked for the check back and our waiter wasn't even planning on giving us back the change. He was going to keep it. So we got the change back but not all of it, just the bills because he said there was just some change. It was annoying. I don't like when waiters keep the change when we didn't say you can keep the change. I feel like they should give us back the change and we can decide how much we want to tip him. Our meal was only $24 and we did still tip the $6, but it was the fact that he wasn't even going to give it back for us to decide how much we wanted to give him."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. They are good at appetizers and pizza. The salads are good. They should stop trying to make Italian food. The minestrone soup was horrible, it was all cheese and bread chunks. It did not even resemble minestrone soup. The chicken lazzania was basically an overcooked pasta Brick with tomato sauce on top. When we told out server, a he said was that is how they make it here."}
{"text":"Salad was AMAZING! Halfbaked cookie and ice cream was to die for! Waiter was cute! 5 stars."}
{"text":"First of all service was slow because they were understaffed. But here's the bad part prices are higher and they nickel and dime you and charged us for sauce for the pasta dishes that barely had sauce. Plus $1 for a side of ranch for fries. wtf. Never going back when a restaurant can't spare an ounce of dressing for fries."}
{"text":"We were much more successful on our second attempt to dine at Oregano's, mostly because the first time we tried at about 6:30pm on a Saturday.  Sunday proved much less busy, although not quiet by any standards.  The place was still pretty packed, and for good reason: the pizza is delicious.  We ordered the Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato pizza and a large house salad.  Both were awesome.  The combination of toppings on the pie was perfect, and the thin crust was cooked just right.  The salad dressing was like a spicy, red eye-talian dressing that I could not get enough of.  They really do have a \"Menu can trust\" as stated on the shirts of the staff.

The service was great too, friendly, yet sassy.  Beers on tap left a little to be desired, but apparently we are \"spoiled\" in San Diego with our local brews.  I tried the local Four Peaks Kilt Lifter...not bad, but not particularly good either.  Nonetheless, SO glad we ate here!"}
{"text":"Ok... i'm not getting the hype.

The problem I had was that with everything good, came something bad.  
- Menu: huge selection of basic mom-pop italian food.  The pizza is definitely the highlight, Problem was that it was too huge, including the goofy oversized menu that hit my partner in the head all the way across the table.
-Pricing: pretty good. some things were high, some were low, but all in all i have to say pretty darn good for the portions.
-Portions:  We had the garlic cheese bread, awesome and HUGE - almost too huge though for an appetizer, to the point where it filled me up too much and i could barely finish my pizza!  The pizza, as well, was HUGEEE (we got the chicago style - DO NOT get appetizers if you are getting a chicago style because you WILL NOT finish it, or even come close, be happy with pizza for the next week).  On the other hand, we also got the \"zany zitti\" which was... well pathetic.  Small and unsatisfying, served in a bread bowl, and i mean cmon how many carbs can one person have???  The flavors were boring as well - not something i would ever recommend, being i've made better at home from a box.
-Flavors: Not bad, but not special.  not surprising - so in my opinion, therefore not interesting.

All in all - if my guy wanted to go back for the good pizza, i'd be ok with it, but its definitely not a place i'd drag my friends to on a good thursday night."}
{"text":"AMAZING every single time I go!  Here are a few of my favorite things about Oregano's:

1. Their bellinis are delicious!
2. The cheese garlic bread with marinara sauce is the best appetizer ever.  The bread is so long, it extends over both ends of the basket.
3. Their Julius Caesar's salad with chicken is the best chicken caesar salad I've ever had.  The \"junior\" size is huge, and it's not like your average chicken caesar salad, where you get a few pieces of chicken on top.  Every bite is laden with delicious, juicy chicken that's been seasoned to perfection.
4.  All of their thin crust pizzas are great!  (Order with extra sauce!)
5.  They give kids a mini pizza tin and ball of dough so they can \"make\" their pizza while they wait.  Such a cute idea!
6.  For dessert, I highly recommend the \"pizzookie\" in any flavor.  (Tip: you can order half one flavor and half another flavor!)

We usually end up with plenty of leftovers, so make sure you come hungry!"}
{"text":"First time at this oreganos,  not impressed. Pizza was mediocre at best.  Ordered a salad it was huge but it was wilted and brown.  Gave it back to Michael our waiter.  He never even apologized. Did offer another.  But I refused.  Food delivery was on the slow side waiter kept our glasses full.   Will probably not go back anytime soon.   Pizza was cheese and pepperoni,  pepperoni was pretty much mia. Good luck if you go."}
{"text":"I met one of my best friends here... she was a server and she would just up and chat like we'd been friends forever, that is how the staff is.  I became a regular for lunch since I worked right down the street.. Phenomenal food, great atmosphere.. don't work down there street anymore and don't get there as often as I'd like.. Pizza Cookie.. one word: AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed the Oregano's chain and this one is not much different than the others. My last visit was during the record breaking rain from hurricane Norbert. It was decided to close the shop and have a fun Ferris Bueller's Day off.

This location seems a little smaller the some of the others and can get very busy. They usually have some pretty cool jazz music playing or something that will make you want to tap your foot while you wait.

Usually get one of the the Real Big Salads or a tasty and delicious Thin Crust Pizza. Could not resist ordering the Numero One-O Stuffed Pizza on my last visit. Decided to get it TO GO and it must of weighed ten or twenty pounds.

Food is always pretty tasty and the service is friendly and attentive. Really like their homemade sausage and the Rib Eye Salad. Looking forward to trying out the famous Original Pizza Cookie with Ice Cream for the topper on our next visit.

Located in the PV Mall parking lot in the SE corner next to the candy store. The restaurants in this parking lot are always changing but this one is definitely a keeper. PIZZA ME BABY!

{"text":"Food was great and the restaurant was very nice! Went in on a Saturday night when they were busy and sat at the bar. Service was great and stayed calmed during a rush."}
{"text":"Great food. Pablo salad is huge and best I've ever had. Meatball sub with sweet potato fries....the best.  Just talked myself into it...on my way."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bruschetta was tasty and portion generous for the price only thing was tomatos needed to be cut smaller to be bite size.  Staff was awesome -friendly and knowledgeable.  Need to dust bottles decorating the bar."}
{"text":"Visited this location twice, and had a very bad experience both times!  First I just went for dinner.  We ordered a deep dish pizza for 3 of us to share.  We were told it takes about 45 min to cook?  Whatever, ordered anyways.  About 45 min later, a manager comes over and tells us he gave our pizza to another table by mistake.  He says he already put another pizza in and it would be ready in a few min.   About 10 min later he comes back with a pizza, a thin pizza.  We thought he was joking at first.  However, we weren't about to wait for another pizza so we ate it and left hungry, luckily the bill was comped though.

The next time was with a group of 15 people.  They DON\"T TAKE RESERVATIONS!!???  We were told to send someone from the party an hour ahead to hold a table, like saving seats at a movie theater? So me and another person arrive an hour before the time everyone else was coming.  3pm on a weekday.  The place was nearly empty however they still seemed uneasy about seating us, and tried to split our party into several tables.  We finally get things sorted out with the hostess and decide to hang at the bar.  Since we knew the pizzas take 45 min to an hour to cook, we decide to pre-order some for the table.  The bartender has to check with the manager, and we get a hard no, with no explanation.  I happen to see one of the managers hanging by the bar and ask him about it.  He tells me they have a catering thing and the kitchen is backed up (like I care).  We don't do preorders, it's our policy. We bring up the reservations. It's our policy.  So we've run into several of your policies that have inconvenienced your customer, just to make it easier for you!  A different manager comes over and asks us what is going on, we explain how we wanted to preorder.  He says that's fine. Guess the kitchen wasn't so backed up after all?  He then tells us that next time we have a big party we should cater.  I even had to clarify if 15 was that big of a party? Also, that he was encouraging us to cater, rather than visit the restaurant.  So we place our order and keep sitting at the bar until 4pm.  I then go to the hostess to get our table, just as the rest of our party starts to filter in. Surprise!  She gave our table away!  Luckily another hostess who seemed to be the only intelligent one in there made arrangements to push some tables together.  Even though we were just told that none of the tables moved.  We get seated and the rest of the evening goes smooth.  Me as well as everyone in our party will not be returning.  On both occasions the staff seemed to only care about themselves, and made little effort to accommodate us. Unfortunate because the food isn't bad.

And for anyone wondering, I have lived in Cave Creek my entire life."}
{"text":"Local's joint that is a \"find\" for tourists.  Stick with the pizza (the menu is broader but don't waste your time) and a cold beverage and you won't be disappointed.

Parking is somewhat limited (try in back), but if you're walking around downtown that's not an issue.  Act like you've been there when you see the celebrities (the local sports stars are there often)."}
{"text":"I am madly in love with this restaurant! The pizza, the quac-a-tony, the ballini's! WONDERFUL!"}
{"text":"Hello,

I couldn't find a place to leave feedback other than this email box. I hope it's an appropriate channel and my server (Jenna)  gets some sort of recognition.
I have been to Oreganos in Goodyear many many times. It's one of our favorite places to dine at.  I always experience good or average customer service. However on my visit on August 2, the service was amazing! Best I've had in any restaurant.   We had a server who was extremely sweet and attentive. She NEVER stopped smiling and made me feel comfortable every time she was at my table. My husband and I noticed her attentiveness the second time she came around. She was consistent and paid attention to detail. 
Right before our visit was over, she noticed I hadn't eat one of my dishes. I told her it wasn't what I expected. She apologized and took it with her. She came back and had it removed from my check and offered to exchange for anything else. 
We ended up getting desert, which is something we never do! 
We appreciate everything she did for us and commend her on her customer service. 
All the Little things she did,  matter so much and I'm so appreciative of Jenna. I will come back and ask to be seated with her every time I visit regardless of the wait I may experience. 


Thank you for your time and attention!


Ps if Jenna ever needs a job, tell her to give me a call! :)

{"text":"Oreganos is the BOMB. This location is usually popping with college students. The staff is generally super nice and quick but I had a terrible experience with one of the hostesses. 

Came here on a rainy night with 2 friends and had one friend who was on the fence of making it on time. Due to the rain the patio was shut down eliminating a lot of seating. I told the hostess there were 3 but maybe 4 of us and she said \"no problem you will get sat at a 4 top anyway.\" We went to the bar in the meantime and had a drink and when we came back outside realized pretty much everyone after us was already seated. Finally my friend said something and the hostess said she didn't seat us because our 4th wasn't there yet.

She must have felt the fire coming out of our eyes because we got sat right after that at a table that fits 8. Long story short - make sure you understand this alleged policy that I have never experienced at any of their other locations.

I was in a carb coma an hour later so all was fine."}
{"text":"From the time we walked in we were treated like family. Our server Andrea was amazing, so sweet & attentive. Even though there was a wait between our entrees, the service from her & Manager Scott was outstanding! It was a busy night, but felt like we were part of all the excitement! Thank you Manager Scott & Andrea for making us loyal guests! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Want to start off by saying that I've been going to Oregano's for the past 6 years. Everytime I come to this location I always get a bad experience. Came by around 8:20 on Tuesday May 8th, 2018. I figured we were gonna have a good one this time around because I seen the old man manager who is usually at the Elliot location and he usually runs a tight ship. We always get a kids mac n cheese for my son and my wife and I always share a big caesar salad with extra chicken and el diablo chicken pasta. The food took about 20-25 minutes to come, which is fairly long because it wasnt busy like crazy, but it was modest amount of traffic coming in and out where it shouldn't have taken that long. When they did bring the food out, they forgot the garlic toast that usually comes with both pastas (diablo & m&c). They barely put any diablo pasta sauce in the dish which this location is bad at doing. When they finally brought the garlic bread, my son's was completely burned, black, and hard on one end and my wife's was also overly cooked and was partially hard. She brought up to the waitress attention about the pasta sauce and she said she would bring an extra side of it, which she never did and she played it off like she didnt know, but I doubt that they didnt even make the extra side of sauce. So after we finished she gave us the check without asking for dessert which we did want a pizza cookie to go. After ringing it up the dessert, she came back and told us that she would give us the pizza cookie for free because of all the inconvience of the diablo pasta which we hardly ate because of the fact that it was mostly pasta and no sauce. The original bill was 34 and change not including the pizza cookie since she had brought the bill before I ordered the desert. Since she said it'd be free, I put my card in the check book so she can charge the 34. When she came back, I noticed that the original itemized receipt still had 34, but the debit card receipt showed 39 and change so she still charged us for the pizza cookie after she said she wouldn't. We waited and waited for her to come by to bring it to her attention, but she was taking so long that we just left and grabbed our dessert on the way out. This is about the 3rd and final disappointing experience we've had with this specific location and it always seems to be the same inconsistent issues and I believe it's because of the college students who are working. They dont take their job serious and they're just there to get by college by doing the minimum at work and of management for not making sure they're doing what they're suppose to, especially when the old man manager with the unusual walk is there. We will not be coming back here. We will just drive the extra mileage and continue going to the Elliot location where it is 10x better. For those first timers, you'll probably rate it 5 stars because you dont know any better, but if you're a long time costumer like us then you'll know the difference and you'll know that Organo's has fallen back a little because they're portions are smaller than before, they try to be cheap now when it comes to the expensive dishes and ingredients and sauces. They use to allow half chicken and shrimp on pasta and now you can only get one or the other. They use have the choice of shredded or cube chicken which was awesome because the cube chicken was way better than the shredded and now they just do shredded. They've changed a little throughout the years and its definitely not for the better. Just wish they can go back to the old Oregano's where it gave you the feeling of a family mom and pop shop which is what made it special and made me excited to keep showing people about this establishment, but now they just carry themselves as another franchise big chain restaurant who cares more about profits then the satisfaction and happiness of their new and long time customers."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Food was fabulous so Chicago. Makes me miss all the wonderful things about Chicago.  Especially the food surely don't miss the weather!!!  Everything so tasty. You definitely have a WINNER.  Thanks for the tasty dishes."}
{"text":"Worst experience! I have been going to oreganos for over 10 years. It was my favorite restaurant... but not anymore, not after tonight's terrible service. First I saved my spot online through yelp. It said a 3-14 minute wait. We got there when it said to check in. I have used this multiple times and no problem. I waited for over an hour. No exaggeration. Checked in at 6:14 and was finally sat at 7:20. This is after asking the hostess 3 or more times when are we going to be sat. Then the service was awful and so was the food! The alfredo the dark was dry and plain. Only saw my waitress to take my order, drop off food and check. Never told me the kitchen was backed up or if the food was good. Nothing! We sat in the restaurant for an hour after being sat! Did not order pizza or a pzookie. Just pasta! But the fastest thing of the night was to giving me my check and my card back with in 2 minutes. Terrible terrible service! I will not be back nor recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Love this place, however, they don't prepare food the way the other Oreganos do.  Easy enough to fix, I suppose.

My only real complaint about Oreganos is that the music is so loud, you have to shout to be heard across the table."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!  Fresh toppings, crust is very good, and sauce is amazing. I love to sit outside on the covered patio and enjoy my pizza and beer."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a meal inside and as usual the Alfredo the dark was in rare form and came out fast. The salad was too loaded with dressing this time, ut despite the many apologies, the biggest letdown of the evening was the signature drink of the place, the Bellini. The explanation was that the machine was broken because the Bellini did not look at all like it's swirly self, just a blob of uncolored ice on this visit.  Don't try and pass off your best drink to us if it's not what it's supposed to be, just stop selling the thing. The waiter was nice, but Lawrence would be rolling in his grave if he saw his signature drink looking that bad."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service.  We had the thin crust meat pizza, salad and meatballs.  Can't find a better Bellini.  Would have been 5 stars but the air was out so we had to be resat 3x."}
{"text":"Our server Jesus was fantastic.  Drinks and food were really good.  The table by the fire was so nice and relaxing.  Great place.  I only took 1 star away because it took am hour or so to get our food once seated."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice overall.  Forgot to bring our sons dough after we asked twice.  Food took forever.  So long, I asked if we would even get our appetizers before the food, which we did, finally.  When the food came out nearly and hour later, the pizza was burnt, not a little burnt but super burnt to where they should have not brought it to the table.  When we said something about it, the replacement only took 6min.  My son was starving so he refused to send his burnt piece back and was only able to eat half of it.  Eggplant was good.  Husbands sandwich was super soggy.  Not consistent at all with other locations.  Super disapppinted."}
{"text":"Great food, staff, & atmosphere! Coleslaw is to die for :-) Meatball sandwich was delicious"}
{"text":"So lame! Stupid policy! They don't seat incomplete parties. It's not like they are busy today. I could understand if it was packed.. But it's NOT! Unfortunately it's where the birthday girl wants to eat. Take this place off my list. F this place!"}
{"text":"Usually this place has been pretty good. You know that you are going to wait for a seat when you come, but that's expected. But once you get your seat, they have done rather well. HOWEVER, this time was TERRIBLE! We sat down and waited 10-15 minutes to even be acknowledged. We ordered food and our drinks right away... But the drinks never came. The waitress was too busy walking around. I requested to speak to a manager and nothing really came out of it. She didn't even apologize for the lack of service after her manager \"spoke\" to her. We also had to remind her about the silverware. Not very happy with this place."}
{"text":"i know everyone LOVES this place, and i feel like i should too, nay i WANT to love it, but i just don't. the food nor the atmosphere is definitely not worth the wait - and there is always a wait. living down the street, i would drive by this place sometimes 10 times a day, morning, noon and night, all days of the week, and there are always people waiting out front - crazy!

i think the atmosphere is kind of cheesy - fake vintage posters and cans of funny looking tomato sauce piled on shelves - and reminds me of a disneyland type of joint.

the food is ok, not amazing. but for the price it's fine, i just can't justify waiting that long for it, i guess.

i like the part inside, part outside thing they got going on.

sometimes i'll pop in the bar for a glass of wine late, but i'm just not that stricken by this place like the rest of the world is.... oh well."}
{"text":"Would give it 5 stars, but they have Pepsi products so lowered it to 3 stars.  Nothing worse than Pepsi!!"}
{"text":"I've tried time and time again to like this place, but the pizza ,,,hmmm..is mediocre at best...the pazookie ice cream cookie is great and so is the atmosphere.."}
{"text":"Great private dinner with our company after a long day. The food was great and the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza here is fine, but do yourself a favor and get the deep dish.  Its so worth the wait, the pizza I had in Chicago was not this good.  The location at Glendale is really small so you can usually plan on a bit of a wait.  But for me being a Chicago style pizza guy, its the best I have had."}
{"text":"No matter how good the food the way the staff is run is stupid.  We arrived at 4:40 with a party of eight and told we would have to wait 1 hour.  when we got here there was a table sitting empty for 8.  although we asked numerous times if we could sit at the table we were told they had to call all the people in front of us first.  so.......for 1 hour we stood and watched the table for 8 sit empty and then they sat us at that table.  it sounds ludicrous but they would not seat us until they went through all the 2's and 4's in front of us.  i have been to a number of Oregeno's and this appears to be their management style.  we will not go back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Nothing compares where we come from. The BBQ chicken pizza is to die for and the Peach Ballini is dangerous in a good way!"}
{"text":"The flavor of the food was outstanding! I had The kale Cesar salad and my wife had the Antipasto salad. I put the pictures on line. The salads were huge! Too big for one person at a Price that was very reasonable.

Not knowing what size the salads were we had also ordered pasta but we took them to go because the salads were too large to eat as well as have pasta.

Anna, the server was great. She made our experience worthwhile. However she was over task it appeared that she was running from table to table trying to keep up.

The reason I drop this review by one star was that it took over 30 minutes from the time that we ordered until the time we received our salads. Prep time on salads should not be 30 minutes. It took us over 30 minutes to eat our salads and our pasta was still not ready.  You would be able to turn tables quicker and reduce customer wait time if you had your kitchen better staffed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Pablo Picasso Salad is so amazing and one of my favorites. My parents visit from Missouri a few times a year and this is one place that we always go. Their pizza is awesome too! Sign up for their email list and they send you a coupon for a free dessert for your birthday! We love the shrimp schooner appetizer too!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! I have been here quite a few times over the years and everything that I have eaten here has been amazing!  This has become a must stop restaurant for me, when we drive thru Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  The crust is fantastic.  The server we had was a professional and provided superb service.  The portion sizes were impressive."}
{"text":"Great place! always friendly staff and amazing food. we will be back! always greeted with a warm welcome and made to feel apreciated"}
{"text":"The customer service is excellent here. The staff was all welcoming and friendly. We chose to sit outside which was a horrible idea. We got the table in the far back and there were like 10 flies that kept flying around our table. We ordered an appetizer which was calamari, super good and the deep dish pizza. The pizza was super greasy but was ok nothing special. After we got to our hotel room an hour later all of us were really sick with diarrhea for days. Will not be coming back for the pizza at least."}
{"text":"\"No Vegans Allowed\", reads a sign posted just above the entrance and narrated by a middle aged man in slow motion usually working for charlie brown. Okay, maybe not, but it should be there. The only thing truly vegan on the menu is the guacamole, so they claim. The pastas all have cheese, even just red sauce pasta (they cook the cheese into the sauce), my sources reveal. The only reason I find myself at Oregano's is if one of my friends is getting a melted chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on it, which, to be honest, looks delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome thin style pizza. 2nd best to our favorite NY spot. Cheesy garlic bread was amazing, perfect when waiting for your pizza on a busy night. Our drinks were never empty. Rachel was the best ever. Would love it if Oreganos came to CA!"}
{"text":"Food is fine, service sucks. So.. 3 stars it is. Everyone says the pizza is sooo amazing, but it's so not. There are much better places in the valley for really great pizza. The food isn't awful or anything, but it is pretty forgettable."}
{"text":"Ok, so i really dont know what the fuss is all about....maybe i just ordered the wrong pizza, my fiance ordered two blue moons and a deep dish pepperoni, sausage,  mushroom and bacon pizza because we heard it's they're deep dish \"SPECIALTY\" .....uuuuugh it was awful i could barely eat my slice. It was salty and you could barely taste the marinara sauce and it was waaaay waaaay over priced!!! They put a whole sausage patty on bottom and the dough is hard on bottom....disgusting!!! Not only that but our bill was like 60.00 dollars but we also waited about 45 minutes....so the only things that were good were the wings and the blue moon. I should of went to little caesars lol..."}
{"text":"My husband travels monthly to Phoenix. From out of state. Every time he raves about this \"pizza place he always goes\". Finally after a quick one day trip I said \"Bring home some of that pizza you always talk about\". He hand carried a thin crust Italian sausage pizza across 4 states.  And man was it delicious. I highly recommend going here. And foresee more hand carried pizzas in my future :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great service and friendly servers! ! Great food! !! I love the salads, the pizza and Italian gold wings!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, and had a similar experience both times. No long waits at lunch time. Excellent servers, very accommodating. The food was just ordinary. The tv's only stuck on playing old 50's shows. 
By biggest complaint is the salads. They are not crisp at all. Kind of like they are prepared in advance with too much dressing. Also, I had chicken in my salads, and I didn't care for it either. Kind of rubbery."}
{"text":"Starting off by saying how great the service is. Every time I come, I experience welcoming and informative servers. Matt was our most recent one and he was very attentive. I always end with a peanut butter pizookie which is a must. I got the Italian sandwich which was alright, the bread was a little too crunchy for me. Definitely recommend this place to anyone craving good Italian grub!"}
{"text":"I mentioned the cookie and ice cream to my daughter and that's all it took to decide where to go for dessert. When we arrived I decided we should have dinner first, the responsible parent thing to do. I had Italian sandwich & sweet potato fries(which I love) My daughter got the sausage pizza with flavored tea(which she did not love) but our waiter Brandon was quick to make her happy and switch her drink for something she did enjoy. Of course we shared the amazing melt in your mouth warm cookie with ice cream, but our dinner made us so full we may have left a bit or two. Next time dessert only, worth the stop for the dessert alone! Great food, great service..."}
{"text":"Oregano's was amazing. The food was delightful. I had a deep dish pizza and the ranch was amazing. When I went it was on a Friday night and cold. They have heaters you can stand or sit under while waiting for a table(outside). While waiting for a table my group was offered beverages. My group and I were able to sit inside so that was nice cause it was freezing. I would give this review 5 stars but I did have to ask for water about 3-4 times from the waitress. Other than that it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Primary reason for the 1 star:
While seated inside before we even ordered anything, I got 5 mosquito bites.  This is quite frustrating to say the least.  I recommend they remove all standing water from around their property and call in professionals to deal with this issue. 

Secondly, the service was lacking.  Our waiter was in a hurry and inattentive.  First he took half the tables order, and then ran off before the rest of us could order.  Second, our drinks were rarely refilled.  He would grab a water glass and take it to who-knows-where to fill.   How about using a pitcher?   How about getting US a pitcher?  

Also the food took a good 40-50 minutes to arrive.  We spent a good 2.5 hours there from start to finish.  Way too long.  

Positives:
The regular house salad was very good.   The thin crust pizza was pretty good.   

I'll be sure to provide an updated review again when I come back in another year."}
{"text":"I love all their food. Their pizzas are thin and crispy, and their pasta is filling. My favorite pizza is their thin crust Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Pizza, it has thin slices of potato and pesto - a perfect combination. For non-pizza lovers - their bollo pasta is endless, but one bowl of angel hair pasta and homemade sauce is enough to fill up anyone who is hungry. 

Recommendation: Their Alfredo the Dark is only \"okay\" if you get it as is. I would order extra sauce or it's too dry to be edible.

End with a pizza cookie. Just do it."}
{"text":"Love this location!  Never have had a bad experience. Usually get the big beefstro salad and am never disappointed. Service is quick and the staff is very pleasant."}
{"text":"New to Tempe, never had Oreganos before, ordered a large cheese to go...
O M G  :  Its like the cook, poured a bottle of salt on the pizza, I couldnt eat but a couple of bites, 
very disappointed, heard good things.

tonite I am trying Otto Pizza, will see if thats better"}
{"text":"Always great food! Service was great at the start but our waiter was pretty distant! The thin crust pizza is outstanding, we also love the the shrimp! Atmosphere is very family friendly and the manager was so helpful! Only thing I would change is their garlic bread, too crunchy! They need some bread with oil and cheese that would be much more authentic"}
{"text":"Started out horrible!  Walked in about 4pm on a Sunday and was told by three hostesses it was going to be about a 45 minute to an hour wait. That was fine it was my daughter's birthday and that's where she wanted to eat. However within the first five minutes of being there we saw three tables get vacated and with drinks and a few items left on the tables. Those tables sat for a total of 40 minutes before anybody bussed those tables.  We asked the three hostesses that were doing nothing but standing there about those tables and they said we don't bus tables the waitress busses the tables.  Behind us was the to go area with about five people doing nothing but standing there.  A man came in to get pizza to go and it was squished like a taco and they expected him to take it like that.  Even the manager expected him to take it. After he refused he waited about 40 minutes for another one. And then we heard someone else come up to the go area and they were told no more to go orders for another couple hours cause they were too busy.  After the manager came up to the front the tables did get bussed by the hostess girls.  And things started moving after that.  However where is the manager for the first 40 minutes? The hostess girls started telling everybody its gonna be an hour and a half to two hours wait and they only have about 15 names on the list!  Once we did get sat we had the best waitress ever!  Her name was Felise.  She was super nice and very fast!  She made us laugh and we had a very enjoyable experience with her! She basically saved our experience! The food itself is very good as well however the kitchen did mess up two of the orders! Our waitress did make sure to take care of it like I said she was awesome!  I know they just opened but the managers really do need to make sure that the hostesses and the people up front are doing away better job and have better customer service as well as their customer service skills!"}
{"text":"The service was great! We walked in and got greeted by many workers. However the food wasn't as good as it usually was at other locations and there were flies everywhere, surrounding our table. It's been difficult for me to want to come back to this location."}
{"text":"This place has its moments.....when its not too busy its a great experience. Food comes out in a timely manner amd tastes fresh! When its busy thats where things go down hill. I give a 4 because I like the atmosphere and love the food. Shrimp scampi is awesome!!"}
{"text":"The Cheese literally oozes out of the Stuffed Deep Dish pizza onto the table... Literally!  If you love Cheese, You will love there stuffed deep dish!  

Although the deep dish pizza's take 40-50 min. to cook, it is certainly worth the wait.  I suggest trying spinach dip while you wait.

Service was great, can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Nice casual Italian restaurant. Food is very good (portions are too big). We really enjoy the Caesar Salad (they are generous with Anchovies upon request) and the garlic chicken lasagna."}
{"text":"Always great food, terrific service and reasonable prices. My only complaint is that I'm always too full for a pizza cookie!"}
{"text":"\"Yum!! YES PLEASE!!!

Love the thin crust, and that COOKIE!!  :)

When summer is over, it's is so much fun to sit outside and enjoy at any of their locations.!!\""}
{"text":"Yum!! YES PLEASE!!!

Love the thin crust, and that COOKIE!!  :)

When summer is over, it's is so much fun to sit outside and enjoy at any of their locations.!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is like God's tears in my mouth! Always a solid meal! Definitely my go to spot when I can't make my mind up. Super chill staff! I salute u Oreganos!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with the service. We expect a wait when we go here, but normally because they are busy; in this case it was because much of the staff was confused or standing around. When we were seated it took almost 10 minutes to be even acknowledged and our server to come over. By then we were ready to order, so ordered drinks and food at the same time. It was then another almost 10 minutes to get the drinks 

On the up side the pizza was really good. The pasta dishes were average. I did have to get up from the table to go track down our server as when we were fine he never came back and we needed or check. It will be a while until I go back."}
{"text":"Place always has great food and great service.   Seems like every time we go there the music is getting louder and louder.   Guess the managers missed the definition of background music"}
{"text":"I love Oreganos!!! I love the Chicken Pablo Picasso Salad, their pizza, the pasta, and the kick butt garlic bread. What I didn't love today was the extreme delay in our order and the lack of customer service. 

Understanding that we did go to lunch at Oreganos on a Saturday during lunch time, I would not expect two salads and two think crust pizzas to take just over an hour. If that was going to be the case, especially since I had two young girls with me, it would have been nice for the staff to let us know that. We sat at the bar and their didn't seem to be a dedicated server or bartender. The staff kept changing, but no one was really attentive and they were forgetful. I paid my tab as soon as they took our order. I paid extra to receive money back for a good tip, but was short changed. The girl that took my money never came back and I because I was getting so frustrated, I didn't ask someone to go get her. No one updated on our order status at anytime. Super disappointed in our service today  

The one saving grace was the salads were delicious and so were both of our pizzas!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad that I didn't take a picture of my amazing Pablo Picasso Salad. 

This Oreganos is my favorite location. It's spacious, the service is great, and the food comes out fairly quickly. 

This was my friends first time, which is just crazy to me! She ordered the heck of a slice, it's really to pieces of pizza and the Caesar salad. She was happy with both. As I mentioned earlier, I ordered he Pablo Picasso Salad, a true favorite and it didn't disappoint! 

Check this location out. It's still busy, but its bigger than many locations and doesn't feel claustrophobic. You will also be treated with a friendly staff and great food!"}
{"text":"We had a awesome waitress that made up for waiting 40 mins to be seated for a party of 2. We were given to go cups without even asking. My wife and I were very impressed. We defiantly will go back again."}
{"text":"The hubby and I went there on a Saturday night.  The hostess said the wait was between 20-35 minutes.  After adding us to the list she then called a cocktail waitress over to get us drinks while we waited (which was only 20 minutes).  After we were seated our server came by to introduce herself and answer any questions we may have, she came back after about 5 minutes to take our order after giving some helpful recommendations.  Both our meals were very good and we each had leftovers for lunch the next day.  The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because our server let our drinks go empty so long that the hubby had to call another server over to get us more drinks because our server was no where to be found.  Most of our meal was without any type of beverage what so ever.  I know that may seem like a small thing to some but it is part of the experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a couple days ago with my bf and his dad, and everything was wonderful. Our amazing server Kellee even hooked it up with a pazookie for it being our first time ever in there- haven't had good service like that in a while. This place is great and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We love Oregano's! The kids are entertained with the raw pizza dough that they can shape and play with until the food arrives. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the calamari strips - they are my favorite items and I could just eat these and ignore the amazing pizza and pasta dishes. But alas I have to share and so still have room for the pizza - all of the pizza is great but I really enjoyed the customizable options and I loaded my thin crust up with sun dried tomatoes, black olives, onions, and peppers. My hubby had the thick crust pepperoni which he shared with the kids. We also had the garlic bread which was so yummy too! And last but certainly not least is the Pizza Cookie imagine a thick fresh baked cookie topped with rich melting vaniall ice cream - pure heaven!

Strongly recommend hitting this place up at least once, the long lines, which you will see every night of the week can attest to the delicious food that this restaurant puts out."}
{"text":"It's all about the marinara sauce here! It's delicious and well flavored. Started off with the 2 giant meatballs no cheese, hot wings (not that hot but good flavor), bruschetta which had fresh tomatoes and garlic with toasted bread (big portion). My favorite was the garlic roasted chicken lasagna it was worth the calories ( flavor was on point and the lasagna pasta was el dente) we then ordered what we hoped would top our Chicago pizza experience we had, unfortunately it was more cheese than pizza. We ordered the STUFFED PiZZA half PUERTO PEÑASCO CARNE STREET PIE and half THE OL' MEXIGANO.. had good flavor but way too much cheese, next time we will up the protein and go light on the cheese now we know how they roll. What added the cherry to this review was their staff, super friendly and they have all been there for over a couple of years which tells you about their company culture! Ya for employers who know how to treat their employees. We also tried the dessert pizza which was way over the top but if you combine with ice cream and coffee then it's do able dessert, we only wished they had Italian espresso which would be a fantastic way to end an indulgent meal."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza,  great beer choices.  You can't go wrong here.  Only delay was the wait,  but that went fast with beer and friends!  I will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places. I always  get there Diablo shrimp pasta but this time decided on their mushroom pasta dish. Oh my was is delicious. If you love mushrooms ,this dish is for you. It had this truffle sauce with the mushrooms.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent service by Matt!  Ordered a Canadian Bacon Pizza, great flavor (amazing sauce).  
Great atmosphere and super friendly staff. Interior has a fun twist and is clean."}
{"text":"Oregano's used to be a reliable go-to restaurant with friendly staff and a fun atmosphere.  Unfortunately, over the last year the service has declined significantly.  We have had 4 very bad experiences in the last year at various locations.  Today's experience was negative from start to finish.  Bad, disorganized, slow, and inconsistent service ruined our celebratory graduation dinner.  We had to physically go find servers to help us with drinks, to order meals, and even to pay our bill."}
{"text":"as other yelpers have indicated, the parking lot is atrocious and sometimes there is a long wait, but oregano's consistently delivers tasty dishes that keep me coming back. if you like avocado, i'd strongly suggest ordering the guacatony. you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. Unfortunately our pizza got overcooked and they had to restart it. But the manager immediately came to our table explained what happened and apologized. He offered another appetizer on the house but I opted for a discount and he gladly agreed. This whole time the waitress was attentive and super nice. So much I didn't even mind the wait. When the time came to pay the bill it turned out the manager had discounted the whole thing. I was honestly surprised. 
What impressed me the most wasn't the meal being free. It was the fact that he came to the table and took responsibility for what happened. Real customer service is putting the customer first and you can tell this place provides it and then some. The food was fresh and delicious. This was my daughter's first time there and she loved it.  I want to say thank you to Oregano's because good customer service is hard to find. I totally recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal and and an even greater staff and management."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner at 6:30 on a Tuesday night and they were busy. They said 25 min wait but it turned out to only be a 5 min wait. Nice!! Service was awesome! Food was amazing!! It is a pizza place- OMG the pizza was amazing and soooooo yummy. BEWARE - HUGE serving sizes. Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!!"}
{"text":"I have tried to go for dinner 2 times in the past, but the wait for a table was over an hour, & knowing this is not a 5 star restaurant, and assuming there would not be 8 courses, an hour seemed to long. so I decided to go for lunch on Sunday@ 11:00am, when they opened... there were only about 10 customer's when we got there, & The wait time to get a seat was still 10_15 minutes, ( not sure why, since there were many open tables)the waitress Jordan was awesome, she kept us hydrated with refills, while we waited for about an hour for a thin crust pizza& a meatball sandwich, the food was decent, not worth the wait, but it was OK, then we ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut dessert@12:15, then @1:05 the waitress told us there was a mix up and the dessert was put in a to-go box, but said it would be about 5 more minutes, while we waited, we did see the cooks burn multiple pizzas, (both thin crust, & deep dish), and throw them in the garbage, @ 1:30, I went out for a smoke, at 1:55 the dessert showed up..., that is 100 minutes for dessert!!! ( I know 1st world problems), it was an undercooked 4 inch circle cookie about 1/4 inch thick, with 3 scoops of ice cream, it was good but again, not worth the wait, total time at the restaurant= 3 hours, now I know why the wait time for a dinner seat is over an hour."}
{"text":"There is a lot of good pizza in the Phoenix and Scottsdale areas, but Oregano's is absolutely delish, as they'd call it in, like, California, ha ha..."}
{"text":"A trip to Scottsdale isn't complete without an Oregano's night!
Amazing thin crust pizza, awesome lasagna, tasty salads.
Very cool patio with a Little Italy feel.
Service can be slow and the wait staff tends to be on the flaky side, but you don't realize it because you are enjoying a glass of wine and the company of your friends.
Try the Guaca Tony appetizer.  Guacamole + pizza crust chips = AMAZERFUL!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. However, the \"shroom boom\" did not meet my expectations at all. It's basically bowtie pasta, garlic butter and a gigantic mushroom chopped up. I could've made it at home for less than half the price. I give this dish one star. That's being nice."}
{"text":"Yum!! YES PLEASE!!!

Love the thin crust, and that COOKIE!!  :)

When summer is over, it's is so much fun to sit outside and enjoy at any of their locations.!!"}
{"text":"Whenever we have family in town, we visit here at least once. Wonderful pizza and cookie dessert."}
{"text":"My favorite place for lunch, sit at the bar and get great service!  Salads are delicious and the serving is huge.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of Oreganos. There is usually a good crowd and a wait time to get a table. I've been to Oreganos three times now, and have had good experiences each time, except for the BBQ chicken pizza - not enuf sauce, and they throw in some cheddar cheese which tastes awkward. But overall, my experience there with the waiters and staff, and the food is always good. Portions are big, Price is small, Food and staff is great."}
{"text":"Oregano's is a place for all of your illicit food desires to be appeased. 

I have been to this Oregano's location a few times now and have learned that everything from the bread sticks to the lasagna is bound to be amazing. The service has always been prompted, attentive and kind. 

My only suggestion is that the restaurant honed in on its design and persona. It's quite close to being classic Italian but it seems as if they are holding on to an American appeal. 

Nonetheless, Oregano's is a great restaurant for the entire family."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to get dinner. 
And by dinner I mean pizza cookie. 
Their pizza cookies are to die for! Slightly undercooked cookie dough in a deep dish personal pizza pan with vanilla ice cream and chocolate pieces. 

This is the kind of desert dreams are made of."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! I'm a regular and have never had a bad experience. Kid friendly yet still a nice place to go for happy hour. Their wedding soup is my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"While it takes a little longer to be seated than I would have preferred the food is amazing. The portion sizes are rather large and are very filling. I wish i could eat more because I love the caesar salad and chicken parm sandwich. normally i can push myself to eating both but the pizza cookie is also a must have. This makes this place amazing for groups. The service is also pretty great with the waiters on top of refills and any needs we had."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour 20 min for dinner. Salad was very bitter.   Terrible experience.  Hard to watch other tables around us get sat, order, eat , then leave all while waiting for our pizza. $57 bill for a lot of frustration."}
{"text":"The food was great, so they get 3 stars..The service, on the other hand, was awful! I don't know if we were outside of our waiters station or what, but everything was brought by someone else.. I don't mind that, because it is teamwork.He was never around so we were ignored.  What bothered me was he didn't refill water glasses, when we asked for a side of marinara it took him ten minutes to come back and realized another table must have gotten it instead.  We were never offered parmesan cheese for our pasta or pizza. I wished we had the server in the next station because she was awesome! He was awful..."}
{"text":"We had the deep dish stuffed pizza \"Numero Uno\" and paid about $23 for a 10\" which feeds about 4 adults. I was only able to eat one slice since it was so thick. The crust was thin and the middle layer had about 2 inches of filling. The top layer is a second thin crust with tomato sauce. The pizza takes about 45 minutes to bake so we called it in and were able to just eat it there. However, they normally don't allow you to do that on Fri & Sat during dinner because the wait time for a table may take longer than the time it takes for your pizza to bake.  There have TV's but they only play old movies.  There's also patio seating and a bar outside."}
{"text":"The best pizza in the Valley, hands down. The deep dish pizza is the best. The atmosphere is fun and charming but be prepared for long wait times because the dining room is tiny and they are SUPER MEGA BUSY all of the time!  I highly recommend the garlic cheese bread - it is an excellent starter.  The salads are first rate. The deep dish pizza is FANTASTIC!  The dessert cookie rules! The service is attentive and friendly. Its a fun atmosphere coupled with a great menu which means that you are bound to have an excellent time with friends and family.  There is a reason why both tourists and locals love this place-its AWESOME!"}
{"text":"We showed up tonight and only had to wait about 15 minutes before being seated. The service was great and everyone working there was really nice. I ordered the  Alfredo the Dark pasta with meatballs and my husband ordered the diablo shrimp pasta. Normally I would
Order the one my husband did but we wanted to try more than one thing. We also ordered a kids cheese pizza slice and a kids corkscrew pasta with marinara sauce. The kids meals were perfect and a great portion. The Alfredo dark didn't really have much flavor to me, it was really lacking in the sauce category and the sauce didn't have enough umph! The Jalapeño and bread they serve with it helps a lot. The meatballs were delicious too! The diablo shrimp pasta on the other hand was amazing and flavorful. It wasn't too spicy but delivered a kick. If you love spicy get the diablo shrimp pasta. We will be back again to try a couple of other things. All in all it was a nice family Italian restaurant and we will be back again. :)"}
{"text":"I always love oreganos, it was actually one of my first jobs at a different location. The only reason I dropped a star is because of the way I was greeted when I walked in. My friend and I came in later in the evening just for dessert, they were closing within the hour, but still plenty of time to just get a dessert, and there were still plenty of other people at tables. We walked in, and the two employees standing up at the bar glanced our direction, and turned back to their own conversation. They did not say hi, ask us how many, or seat us. We stood there until a gentleman came up to seat us. As we walked past the 2 girls at the bar, one girl turned and said \"it's not my turn to be given a table.\" We continued to pass them and were seated at a table close to the bar. As the host walked back past the girl, she loudly said \"I'm not taking that!\" And we waited for another server to come take our order. Our actual server was great, and our dessert was great, but I was just shocked by the terrible attitude and customer service of the employee standing at the bar chatting. Very unprofessional. You're here to be working and doing your job, not chatting at the bar and refusing to work."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here yesterday after hearing tons of great things about Oregano's.  It was around 230pm, so not too busy.  We were seated immediately and the service was great and friendly, which isn't always the case when you show up to a restaurant at shift change.

We both had the dinner salad, which was fresh and had all the right toppings.  I had the Zany Ziti and my girl had the all you can eat bowl of pasta (not sure why since she's tiny and couldn't even finish one bowl, but I digress, lol) The food arrived a short time later.  Everything was hot and tasty.  Mine came in a bread bowl, which was a nice touch.  The garlic bread was delicious and crusty and plenty of butter and garlic, mmmmm. The marinara had a nice taste to it with a little kick. The surroundings are very welcoming and laid back, overall a very nice, relaxing environment.

We'll definitely be back, just wish there was one closer to us in the west valley."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night & checked in with Yelp. We were seated right away on the patio. The musters made it very nice out there!

The food was just okay... I ordered the chicken parm & was surprised at how small the chicken portion was compared to the pasta in the dish. The sauce was average (mine is better & I'm Dutch).

Service was good, but not as fast / consistent as it has been at other locations. I think this location relies heavily on the Oreganos brand for business as it isn't like other locations with regard to service or food.

We will definitely give Oreganos another shot; everyone has an off day"}
{"text":"All of the food at Oreganos is absolutely delicious. The servings are very large, I've never left without taking home left overs. This location has super friendly, attentive staff and does occasionally get crowded but they do a great job of trying to make wait times short."}
{"text":"First off... and our first time, there was a short wait which we took at the bar. My bar bill came BEFORE the drinks, ugh. The drinks are routinely (and we watched for 30 mins) poured short and filled with soda or beer. The drinks we had were this way and not very good. The service was slow... took 20 mins. to get our entree. We ordered the penne pasta bake which came in a bread bowl (still asking ourselves why?) which soaked up all the sauce and the extra sausage was nonexistent. The manager came to tell us he'd remake it but it was the \"signature\" dish to which I replied that I expect a pasta dish to be unctuous and cheesie... he told me it was not the \"usual\" pasta dish and his best seller and I said that as a chef I was not aware people liked dried out pasta on bread. So he remade it and it was barely edible. Needless to say, we will not be back altho the pizza looked good... but who wants to haul up at 3AM and GO GET pizza LOL... nope, it's either Jill's house or Carrabba's if we want good pasta. Chef Jill"}
{"text":"Service was great.  The buffalo wings were good.  Salads were enormous, but it very tasty.   B for effort."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing! We had the thin crust because I was trying to be sort of good and it was delicious! The número uno has great meat & veggies, throw on some jalapeños & artichokes and it's to due for! This may be my new go to pizza place! (:"}
{"text":"The food was freaking awesome. We got their version of Alfredo pasta --  Alfredo The Dark -- and it was such a good decision. We also got a thin crust pizza with olives, pepperoni, and mushrooms.  everything was really good. 

The wait was extra long however."}
{"text":"My first trip to Oreganos was pleasant. But that was in Phoenix, so I'm not sure if its this location that's the problem. Don't get me wrong the food was good but the service was mediocre. I don't know if the waitress forgot to put in our order or either my party of 5 ordered some pretty complicated stuff. Either way it took nearly 45 minutes to get our food. I appreciate the apology for the weight but I won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Quick with the app for seating great atmosphere would definitely come back and visit the location back at home in Tucson"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars! The food is delicious for an extremely fair price. Service is always friends and smiling. I always order the boom dip to starts. I have not found a better spinach artichoke anywhere else. I'll split a Caesar salad with my dinning partner and usually split a pasta too! Can't leave this place without ordering a pazooki!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Oreganos from the beginning of time when there was only 1 location, now they are a huge brand and everyone in Arizona knows and loves Oreganos. If you have yet to go there, here is what I recommend. 
-Boom Dip, their spinach artichoke dip is unreal its so good
-Like sausage? Good because they have some crazy good sausage they put on the pizzas. 
-Deep dish, Stuffed or Think crust... you can go no wrong! 
-Garlic Cheese Bread, you cannot come here and not get it!!! 
-Chocolate Chip Pizza Cookie- greatest thing EVER! 
I could go on and on forever but needless to say, everything here is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This place is always hopping. You need to get there at 11.oo am for lunch . The staff was friendly and attentive . Their prices are very reasonable and portions large . My spaghetti was  a little over cooked and the sausage was overcooked . I  like their marinara.  I should have sent my dish back but I was too hungry"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and authentic. Be prepared to order takeout ahead of time during peak. They're that popular. But it's well worth being scheduled into a time slot. We unfortunately had a disappointing dinner on Friday night. Our server was incredibly slow so much so that my children nearly fell asleep at the table and didn't even want the food by the time it arrived. No one checked to ever see if we needed anything in terms of refills or additional drinks. It wasn't even a busy evening by Oregano standards. He additionally was unable to accommodate us when my son point out that his soul had no pasta and was only broth. He said it was premeasured in the kitchen and there was nothing he could do about it. The food will ha E me give it another chance. But the service is lacking."}
{"text":"Do not sit at the bar! You will smell every 10 minutes a sewage scent wafting from the bar area. Not exactly the best experience while enjoying food and drinks. It's disgusting. Fix the plumbing! The food and service is great like all other Oreganos. No sewage smell equals five stars."}
{"text":"Pros. Nice ambiance.  Patio is very nice. Cons. Pasta over cooked and to soft.  I had the eggplant Parmesan  is better at Olive Garden. Carabbas Italian grill a lot better.  Probably won't come back my 4th try and it seems quality of food heading the wrong direction.  Garlic bread was good."}
{"text":"I had never been to one of these before until about a month ago when I went with a couple friends, and now I'm hooked. This location can get a bit loud and crowded (maybe about 30 minutes is the longest I've waited) but it's near Mill so of course. Food is good, prices decent, and most servers I've had were helpful.. . recommended."}
{"text":"First time at Oregano's in East Mesa for lunch. Erica, my server was awesome and very helpful with what to order for my delicious meal which I really enjoyed, plus I placed an order to go for dinner for my family after a hectic busy day from work. Pizza and wings! Yes, oh happy family tonight! Thank you Erica and Oregano's. Will sure be back!"}
{"text":"Really strange parking situation and super inappropriate conversations among the waiters."}
{"text":"We love this location. The food is awesome and the staff is great. If it's just my girl and I we usually sit at the bar. We usually end up sparking up a conversation with other people at the bar and have a great time. 
It's usually packed Thursday through Saturday but if you get there earlier or late enough the wait isn't too bad. 
We've tried a few of their other locations and had a good experience but this is our favor"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Staff was great. Very long wait on the weekend. They don't do take out at certain times for dinner so you can't order for pick up when you want."}
{"text":"We were in town for the NASCAR race, this place came highly recommended by locals we ran into, so we decided to give it a shot. The wait was very long as the place was very busy (worth every minute).  We went to the bar to wait for our table, the bartenders were GREAT!!! They were fun, friendly, attentive and made a great drink.  After being sat at our table, Marvin, our waiter greeted us and the experience got even better. Aside from him being an excellent waiter, the food was absolutely AMAZING!!! We had several appetizers and dinners. Everything we ordered was delicious. This will be our go to place every time were passing through the area."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I eat so much, I leave feeling sick! I eat so much because he food tastes so damn good. Their pizzas, pastas, salads, appetizers, and pizza cookie never ever disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is so dang good. I always have a hard one deciding what to get. Their cheesy garlic bread is amazing. It's crispy with gooey cheese on top. Their BBQ chicken pizzas is one of my fave. I always have a hard time picking between that and one of the pastas. On top of that, then we get a pazooki. They can do half and half with the pizza cookie!! Mind blown. I always leave this place feeling like a busted can of biscuits."}
{"text":"Stopped in with Big Party (10) on Wed night and the restaurant was quick to accommodate. We had wings, pasta bowls (unlimited refills) and Oregano's favorite salad with double chicken. The salad was delicious and the chicken flavorful and tender. The wings were standard and my son's favorite. The pasta was average. We ended with bazookies, their cookie desserts - 2 chocolate chip and 1 macadamia nut. The cookie was warm and slightly undercooked with melting vanilla ice cream. Try the Bellini drink (slushy) but you can only have two and they have a kick!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is decent.  The place is absolutely filthy.  I mean, really dirty.  Just look at the caked on grease and dust on the chandeliers.  Walls. windows, especially in back dining area are sticky and in need of attention. 

This is not a review I want to post.  I really like this place.  but the conditions are such that I have to.  Unacceptable levels of grime, obviously untouched.  You guys need to get this fixed and the GM needs to walk through this restaurant with a fresh pair of eyes"}
{"text":"I ordered the Flagstaff Spinach Salad along with a side of fries today for lunch take-out.

Their sides are NOT sides, they're huge! Which isn't bad. Plus they were delicious.

AS for the salad.... On their website it states:

\"The Flagstaff Spinach Salad
We start with fresh spinach, add lots of sauteed portobello mushrooms, red onions, roasted red peppers, diced tomatoes and mix with a tasty potion of lemon and avocado. It's all topped with a little Gorgonzola cheese. Backpack and tent sold separately.\"

I got no mushrooms and very little onions and peppers. Mushrooms are my favorite too! I do have to say that the lemon and avocado dressing was amazing...

I probably won't go back though, due to the fact that a salad is the easiest thing to make and they still couldn't get it down."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hypes about..   but you can almost read the newspaper thru a larfe peperoni pizza with extra cheese.... paid 43 bucks for 2 pizzas. I am not impressed. Step up your game Oreganos!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Flavorful & fresh food at a great price. The outdoor patio is really nice as well. I love the salads - they are giant, full of yummy mix ins, and clock in under $10. My favorite is the greek-style one, which they amp up with juicy sweet raisins which I initially thought sound really gross but in fact does work really well with the spicy feta and nutty roasted pine nuts. The lunch special of $3 for two really big slices of thin crust pizza is great too. The crust is really thin and perfect for folding, but thick enough to hold up a lot of cheese and a really good flavorful pizza sauce. 

My only complain about Oregano's (all of them) is that the music is always way too loud. Like it's uncomfortable if you get the wrong seat under a speaker."}
{"text":"Really yummy food in large quantities at a great price. The ingredients are fresh, the salad portions are substantial, there are tons of different menu options, and the food is tasty...hard to beat that for a lunch break from work or dinner with the family. The bread bowl pasta (pesto penne) is genius. The Oregano's Favorite salad is amazing and very substantial. It's full of fresh vegetables, tons of cheese, and wonderful toasted pine nuts. I could eat this salad over and over, and the portion size is big enough to make it an actual meal"}
{"text":"Great food as always,  love getting a free Pizzookie on your bday. Service is good, but felt like we had to ask for things instead of the server offering.  Overall great date night place and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and really enjoyed it. There was a lot to choose from on the menu. I ordered an individual pizza and the sauce was terrific, reminded me of my family's homemade sauce. Pizza was a perfect size too. Want to try the new one in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Good pizza, wings , oh my gawd !!!! The garlic cheese bread is amazing ! The cookie ice cream at the end tops it all . I would give it a 5 but I don't wanna exaggerate."}
{"text":"I know I can't go wrong with my neighborhood Oregano's. Our usual go-to is a small pizza and a couple orders of the Italian Gold Wings.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had, my wife and I waited 45 mins when they told us 20 mins and then when I went to ask what was taking so long I got attitude, and our server was so slow and it wasn't ever that packed. Be prepared to wait and have horrible service"}
{"text":"Not very impressed with this pizza joint. the hostess will not place you on the waiting list unless ALL of your party is with you. so don't bother getting there early to get a table for your peeps unless you enjoy waiting that much longer. pizza was o.k. at best. they are also a little to proud of the pizza. the wings did hit the spot though"}
{"text":"After tasting the pizza here, the first word that came out of my mouth was \"OMG\" this is so delicious!! Not salty, fresh materials, great service.

Plzzzzz don't even try to compare this place with Pizzahut, Domino..things..
(well. they are good though,, I mean they are different. )"}
{"text":"Food is great and plentiful.  The salads are HUGE - even the half orders.  Vino Bambino salad is very good.  Bruschetta is also good but garlicky.  Servers are attentive and prompt.  Very accommodating.

A bit of a wait to be seated sometimes, but always good food.  A definite destination every time I come to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza, good local brews on tap. Would have given this another star if it wasn't for the 90 min wait for a table."}
{"text":"Amazing Pablo Picaso salad, thin crust pizzas, and great service for groups."}
{"text":"Ok I want to give it 3-star, but will give it 4 because its a local chain. 

Nice big booths, which can fit large parties that normally would have to get split up or wait for a table to free up.

Their thin crust pizza is cracker thin - I couldn't decide if I liked the crust that thin...

We tried their: salad, pasta, pizza, and pazooki. 

Pizza: numero uno..meh. their sproccoli was a bit more interesting.
Can't remember which salad we got, but it was nicely dressed and had a lot going on.
Their pasta (think we got the alfredo) - was also pretty tasty. 

their drinks are the size of your head - if NYC's major saw the size of these glasses, him and his soda tax would have a field day.

Staff is young, probably all local college students, but all very friendly.

would i come back? yes - but there are just so many other restaurants to try first though in the area."}
{"text":"Oregano's food varies from bad to mediocre.  Eaten there 3 times and sorry to say it's time to part ways.  Their lasagna is as salty and lacking in \"fresh\" flavor as it can be.  Even it's color when cut in to is grayish and unappetizing.  To be honest, it has the general appearance of something you'd scoop out of a pet food can.  If it wasn't hidden by the overly salty tomato sauce, one would wonder.  And it's no better in appearance & flavor than you'd find in a hospital or school cafeteria.  This is not an exaggeration.  If it were really good, I'd be just as honest and say so.  If anyone thinks this dish is delicious, then they've be eating too much Chef-Boyardee.  Their baked ziti is nothing more than cooked pasta and a little cheese in a thin tomato sauce and baked in a tasteless bread bowl, just a mound of pasta and bread.  Their claim to fame seems to be the pizza, but to a true pizza lover, it's just a thick, soggy mess of pizza ingredients baked in a deep dish that practically needs to be eaten with a soup spoon.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is the service.  There are a few servers that seem to genuinely care about your dining \"experience\", but there are others that are just going through the motions.
Thumbs down for me."}
{"text":"Waited to try this place until the initial crowds died down. No problems with the wait times and the service was awesome. Thank you Leah for the great service and the food was delicious. It was worth waiting a couple weeks to try. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant states they have Chicago pan pizza - not quite, but not bad for Arizona!"}
{"text":"Artichoke dip was great
Pizza was really on par with what I've had in Chicago!  Great flavor, crust not soggy, full of toppings

Long wait, but given the options in the area, understandable.  At least they come around to bring you some pizza samples while you wait!"}
{"text":"Even though I love Oregano's thin crust pizza, I have to give 3 stars. First of all, my husband and I went there the other night and had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table that was empty when we arrived. 

Then we ordered pasta. My husband had the Pasta Basta and it was fabulous, exactly as it was described, but I ordered the Alfredo. This was less than desirable, while the noodles were cooked well, they looked and tasted like they were just tossed in olive oil and served. I expected some sauce, but there was nothing!!! It is served with this really dry bread, that I assume you are supposed to dip in the \"sauce\". 

To top it off, when we let the waitress know that there was no sauce, she got her manager who came out and insisted that this is the way it is served (it was boxed up but he didn't even look at it) and next time ask for extra sauce. I shouldn't have to pay extra for something that should come with what I order. 

I have to say the one nice thing they did was comp our dessert."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars due to the fantastic service me and my boyfriend had when we ate here. Our server was friendly and everything was timed perfectly. Food was my bad but was a little spicy. We will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"I was looking for a pizza place close to my hotel in Scottsdale.  Born and raised on the south side of Chicago but had spent the last 15 years in southern VA, I was looking for a taste of home.  I found it!  I had a thin crust cheese and sausage and it was just like home.  Not a sweet sauce (I am not a big fan of sweet sauce i.e. Palermo's on 95th).  I had not had Italian sausage like that since Chicago.  It was on point!!  I ate the whole dang pie...The thin crust was thinner than Chicago thin crust but they also have a pan and a stuffed if you don't care for the thin crust thing.  I can't wait to go back.  Service was great and a few 4 Peaks selections.....cant go wrong here."}
{"text":"Oregano's is my #1 favorite restaurant. While it's known for it's pizza (which is fabulous) I have to recommend the Pablo Picasso Salad. My mouth waters just thinking about it! You don't need to be a salad fan to enjoy this feast. If you don't like spicy, just ask for the dressing on the side and add as much or little as you like. But I've introduced this salad to many who were less than excited to try it, but coudln't stop talking about how wonderful it was after cleaning their plate.  Make sure to save some room for the pizookie!"}
{"text":"We moved to Scottsdale in Jan.17, oregano's on Shea Blvd is the place that has captured our hearts.  The staff is absolutely the friendliest resturaunt staff we have encountered...and the thin crust pizza with meatballs is to die for.
GO!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here at least once a month. We love to sit at the bar because the wait here is always long and the bartenders are so friendly here. We stick to a basic thin crust pepperoni, which is always good, but I've also had the Lady is a Scampi pasta and that's pretty good too. My favorite part is the chocolate chip pizza cookie! Yummy. Great patio to have lunch or dinner and a beer on a nice day."}
{"text":"This place has re-established itself on my list of go-to's, now that I've relocated back to PHX.  Oregano's has a great menu, good value, and friendly staff....and it's in my neighborhood!  Portions are large and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting, as evidenced by the long queue each time I visit.  On my last visit (last night), the spouse and I shared a deep dish pizza and wondered why we didn't order that before.  Since a deep dish pizza takes about 40 minutes to bake, we lingered over our drinks and relaxed after a VERY busy work week.  We were fully primed to inhale our pizza when it arrived and wow, it was delicious.  Piping hot from the oven, we were hard-pressed not to gobble that pizza down, for fear of burning our mouths....lots of cheese but not too much that the crust and dough were swimming in it, tangy sauce, and yummy toppings (choose your own; we selected onions and mushrooms) all made for a wonderful taste experience.  Visit an Oregano's near you and support a home-grown business!"}
{"text":"I decided to try something different, other than my go to Big Rig. I tried the Alfredo in the dark and was pleasantly surprised. Great flavor. A hint of spiciness and a pepper to top it off! Staff was nice and attentive! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch last Friday to meet with a friend. Went at 12noon and was surprised to get a seat right away.  Although it was outdoor seating only available.  I ordered a sausage sandwich with the basket weave fries.. Delish.. love it.. although it takes a little while for food to come out, it's well worth it.  They also give you a huge plastic cup of soda.  Our service was ok, it seemed like our waiter was covering a lot of different tables, but then again I'm a pretty mellow person and didn't mind waiting.  But again the food was mackin, and my friend and I ordered the ice cream pizza cookie.. omgoodness, so good.  soft chewy under baked cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.. Enjoy but it's pretty big so I would suggest sharing."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this particular location. I'm honestly disappointed in the lack of customer service and cleanliness during lunch. Apparently, the bartender/waitress was given an impromptu audit, all the while she had 5 tables and customers at the bar. 
What I don't understand is why didn't the managers standing around assist her in providing quality services to the tables or at least let the customers know that she will be with us or they can assist us.
I thought attention to detail and customer communication was lack luster. I've heard rave reviews, unfortunately today I can't ride the bandwagon of a great review. Management was a big disappointment!!"}
{"text":"This particular Oregano's is a dissaster. I ordered sides the beef only of the beefstaw salad on 3 different occasions and all 3 times I got 3 different prices!!!!. Employees only give you that service smile after you give tips. There are more fake faces here than a a poker table."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location!!  The food was delicious,  our server was attentive,  friendly,  and She really made the experience better. The portions are very hearty.  I just really loved everything about it. The food,  the staff,  what more can I say..  definitely going back and next time,  maybe have room for desert. Yummm!!"}
{"text":"Dans the man!  Our 14 order of wings from the first round ended up being too hot for our taste.  Our server, Kimberly, asked her manager if she can put in another order for us and Dan easily accepted.  He actually took the extra order of wings off of our bill!   Our night was enjoyable, not only because of the great food...but because the service was beyond expectations as well!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to for hot wings but lately I've noticed their \"BIG-ONES\" are much smaller and their hot sauce isn't as hot anymore.  I still go there for the convenience and the friendliness of the staff and most importantly the manager, but the cravings I have for their wings is slowly diminishing!! :("}
{"text":"For a local chain this is one of my favorites. OH Oregano's you make me laugh with your innuendos, your yummy thin crust pizzas, and you've had me with your pizzookies from the first time I've had one. I am grateful alone that I live in a city that has such a ridiculously wonderful and unique specialty that no other place has (that i know of)! Their pizzookies are a great alternative other than drinking if you were in a breakup, a boy passed you up (yes i'll eat my feelings if need be, and that's if a brown bag special passed me up), you failed a test, or had a shitty day.

I love that their pizzookies are either choco chip white macadamia nut or oatmeal raisin. you can do half and half too! and served with two scoops of ice creams makes this an awesome snack or after dinner treat. Anywho... love it!"}
{"text":"If you walk out of this place and you are not happy you need to see a shrink.  Probably best people in town (i know people love to debate that).  But if you love BJ's pizza Newport Beach, this is the place to go.  Amazing staff, amazing food, amazing ambience.  You heard it here.  Plan accordingly, the place is packed!!  PS, buy yourself one of their funny shirts (like \"Legalize Marinara\") as I did.  Classic!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Oregano's for years. It has always been fantastic. The wait can get ridiculous at times so I plan accordingly. But the last time I went it was less than stellar. To avoid the wait for a table (it was rainy and cold this day otherwise we would have taken the faster option of getting seated with first available) we chose to sit at the bar and eat. The waiter took the order of the couple sitting next to us and then took ours immediately after. Our neighbors received their order in the expected amount of time, however, our order did not come out until our neighbors had eaten and paid. This was a bit annoying since we were quite hungry and the orders were taken at the same time. They ordered a large pizza and salads. We ordered a small pizza and a order of wings (their wings are terrific fyi). So I didn't see what the hold up was. When we finally received our order I was not at all satisfied with the pizza. It didn't have the same crispy, delicious crust I was used to, but I am not the type to complain about the food unless there is something seriously wrong. So I just dealt with it. I went to the lady's room to sufficiently clean up the wing sauce and when I got back I overheard the waiter/bartender and my boyfriend talking. He asked how everything was and my boyfriend said the pizza was ok but the wings were great. The waiter left and we were visited by whom I think is the manager. She was an older lady and looked in charge anyway. She came, made some small talk and laughed with us for a moment, and then asked us about our experience. She heard our pizza was only \"ok\" and wanted to know what it was that only made it \"ok.\" So I explained to her and she took what I said seriously. She also took the price of the pizza off the check which was not necessary at all. Although it had been a less than stellar visit to Oregano's I knew that I would be back again because all the other times I've been there have been wonderful. I was completely delighted with this experience because they really showed that they care about what their customers think and they care about their experience with them. I recommend checking it out! Also, do not pass up the pizzookie (pizza cookie), it is to DIE for! yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Love love love their marinara sauce.... Best diverse menu.... And the desserts and Bellinis are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"We are at oreganos at Scottsdale and Shea Blvd
It 90 degrees and humid and the management refuses to run the mist system because it's not 100 degrees out
:-("}
{"text":"Our server was just amazing. 

Great pizza shop with kitschy decor. Kid friendly. Generous portions and great service. 

Would go back in a heart beat if I lived in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love this place for work week lunches! Yummy food, large portions, ample seating in the middle of the day, and reasonable prices especially close to Old Town.

It's the salads that really make me love this place. They are giant, fresh, and full of good toppings. It's hard to find a salad that's big enough to fill me up until afternoon snack time, and Oregano's gets the job done every time. My favorites are the Oregano Favorite and the Picasso Mexico salad. The Veggie sandwich is average - the bread tasted a little funny to me, but the caramelized onions and portabella mushrooms were quite yummy. The big slice of pizza for only $2.99 is an awesome deal as well, and the pizza is great thin crust pizza.

This location has outdoor seating, semi-indoor/outdoor seating, true indoor booths, and bar seating so there is a lot to choose from. They are quick with service, even in the midday rush.

The only negative is that they place their music ungodly loudly. It can be hard to hear conversation at the same table and I find it irritates me. If they took it down a few notches, it would be perfect background music."}
{"text":"Three & a half stars overall. I recommend this Oregano's if you like Oregano's food and want to have a long meal outside. The food is the same quality as other Oregano's, and I happen to really really like Oregano's food. But the kitchen/service is soooo slow. I didn't mind it being so slow since I went in for lunch at 2:30 pm on a Sunday and was not in a rush, but it shouldn't have taken 1.5 hours to get and eat a meal...and I certainly wouldn't be into an 1.5 hour long meal during the work week. It took a good 45 minutes for our salads to even come out, which blows my mind because they weren't crowded with other diners.  

The outdoor patio space is very nice, with picnic tables, nice lights, and mesquite trees to create a courtyard-type feel, but it's right on the main road without a wall to block sound so every motorcycle that guns on by is heard acutely. I always find Oregano restaurants to play their music way too loudly, and even the music doesn't drown out passing cars. They have two corn hole sets, so this location seems best fit for people hanging out, drinking a few beers, & having an appetizer instead of sitting down for a full meal."}
{"text":"These guys have the service totally dialed in and the pizza is mostly right. Some of the other things on the menu, not so much. 

Misc. info in random order:
* They know how to run a successful, extremely busy restaurant, so they're efficient and smart about it. They've got stuff  figured out such as: when you order the cookie to go, they bring out the ice cream at the very last minute.
*  Staff is friendly and, again, usually efficient.
*  They'll usually offer to fill up a to-go cup with your drink when you leave, at least when you eat at the bar.
*  The caramelized onions are not caramelized. They're just cooked onions.
* Don't order the large size deep dish pan pizza because the dough on the bottom tends to be too thick. On the smaller size, it's good. Actually, on the individual size, the dough is perfect.
*  The giant pan cookie is great if you like under-cooked cookies, which I do. If you're not a fan of cookie dough (though it's not actually cookie dough), consider skipping it.
*  Brussels sprouts are a bit of a disappointment, at least for me. Although plentiful, they're under-seasoned and not cooked enough for my taste. I like them drowning in whatever they're seasoned with, and I like them crisped and preferably charred."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! The portions are so big and always delicious. 

I've been to this location a number of times and the service is always on point. Great staff! All of them that comes in contact with you says hello or welcomes you to Oregano's.

Nice, relaxing ambience; with indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good heavy Italian food then this is the place to go. The food is all pretty darn delicious, there is generally a line to wait and the service is good. 

The pizza is dense and delicious. The pasta is plentiful. This is good old American style Italian so you will definitely go home full. Maybe too full."}
{"text":"So I want to write this review before I forget all the horrendous details about the service we received. This was my first time here, I was meeting a few of my friends who attend ASU for dinner. Now being from a world that custimer service is pretty much everything I have to be honest and say that from the gate the service was lacking in every aspect. Let's start with the snotty, young hostess who THOUGHT she was being sly (by talking under her breathe and not looking directly at us but rather above our heads), about talking about our group and how (because one extra person showed up) \"messed up everything\" (her exact words). She continud to talk negatively about us and more so insult us by thinking we were deaf, maybe, because in her head I believe she didn't think we could hear her even though we were literally 4 feet from her. SMH! About 15 minutes later we were seated. Approximately 5 minutes later we were finally greeted and our drink order was taken, drinks dropped off....then almost 10 minutes later our server comes back and finally takes our order only to inform us that it's going to be about 25 minutes for our meal to come out. Now I guess it could take 25 minutes to make 4 pasta dishes, cheese bread and a sausage but that kinda seems long. Nonetheless, our food comes out but one entree short. The server then says it got messed up in the kitchen and it was going to be another 8 minutes. She then comes back and apologizes and says the manager is working on the dish and it will be out soon, about 10 min later the entree finally comes out....I'm going to cut this short as I sure you already get the picture. The experience of our dinner here simply for lack of better words, sucked. 
Only reason I gave them two stars was because however horrible the service was the food itself was pretty good. Portions were large and can definitely be shared. Pretty sure I won't be coming back to this restaurant again, or maybe we will just visit another location with hostesses that don't start out the dining experience so negatively."}
{"text":"Given that some people on here are giving this place a 1 star rating, I am appalled to think that this place had did such a disservice. This is by far one of our favorite restaurants to dine at. I can agree that the wait time sometimes is a little lengthy, but it looks like they have heard the complaints and have made adjustments with the option on the Yelp app to skip the line. Not quite sure how that feature works out in great detail as I haven't used it yet. But to sum it up, delicious food, and great service!"}
{"text":"The food that we had when we visited was pretty good. I will say this they are always just! The wait staff is attentive and really great. I never have issues when I come here. The only thing is the wait. Usually have to wait about 10 -20 minutes on average for 2 people to sit but overall really great place to eat. The food oh my gosh wonderful! Definitely with be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful experience with Oregano's. We had our wedding reception in the private room at this location in March. Mary and Jane did an excellent job answering our many (nagging) questions and catering to our every need. The staff was very attentive and treated every aspect of the evening with a sense of urgency. Everything was served on time, the drinks were always full, and the food was delicious. We were able to play our own music and set the room up before the event. Everyone had a great time! We highly recommend this venue for your next event."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving Oreganos a poor review because I have been to most of there locations several times and it is always pretty good. Just a don't try to pick up food for take out. I waited one hour for take out food and they apparently lost my order and never prepared it. Unfortunately I waited exactly 1 hour for the food and then they told me I could wait another 15 min and they will actually cook it this time. I was to frustrated to wait any longer so I just left empty handed. Just dine in when you eat here and be prepared to wait for a little while."}
{"text":"Once again I decided to call ahead and was told there is a long wait about 45 minutes. Decided not to go again. what kind of place everyday has such a long wait for dinner and it is only 5:30pm on a Tues in summer. Give me a break. I will wait until all of the hoopla dies down."}
{"text":"Not so great.  The hot wings were not good. The flavor was bland and had hardley any sauce.  I had the stuffed numero one-o that tasted very bland and had too much cheese so it melted on my plate. The person next to me had the thin crust which looked pretty good. The wait was extremely long which eould have been okay if food had been worth it. On top of it all it was a little pricy for pizza. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Dude! This place is now open! No more taking the bus down to Camelback just to get a pizza cookie. I could eat their thin crust all day. Now that it's close, I'll probably do that tomorrow."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly customer service from Carli at the Togo counter.  Helped me choose favorites. I had the Big Rig Pasta, includes rigatoni pasta covered with a tomato chipotle cream sauce, chopped basil, diced Roma tomatoes, Parmesan. It was flavorful,  and does have a kick. I added the meatballs,  and I'm glad I did,  they were delicious.  Ordered a dinner salad,  pretty basic.... I wouldn't get again.  I took my food to go, however the restaurant was very busy with people waiting at 8pm on a Tuesday,  impressive. Thanks Oregano!"}
{"text":"Should be named - Not From Scratch.  While I don't expect everything to be made from scratch I was so disappointed that neither my dinner or my friend's dinner had anything that was actually made at Oregano's.  My friend was upset that her salad had bruised and wilted lettuce.  When she mentioned this to the server the manager came over and offered to open another bag of salad for her.  She had the zitti  and it was clear that the bread bowl, the pasta, and the sauce were just packaged items that were combined at the restaurant.  I had the Italian sausage with waffle fries and again, can we say not from scratch."}
{"text":"Food is amazing as usual. Sat at the bar, Richard was are bartender. He's super friendly! Made good recommendations and was super attentive"}
{"text":"Every time I've ever eaten here it's been an extreme pleasure. I would come for the thin crust pizza alone, which is by far the best in the valley, even if it meant having to deal with average service. But that is not the case. Always sincere and friendly service from the bartenders, waitstaff and hostesses. I've never seen anyone in a bad mood, and I've eaten at almost every location.

The pizza, as always, was outstanding- no, orgasmic. Perfectly crispy crust throughout, complex flavor to the dough, ample zesty red sauce, and the sun-dried tomatoes are delicious. Great touch also with coming around with real, fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Bravo!

My only complaint is that you need to bring back Sierra Nevada on tap."}
{"text":"For you Midwestern or East Coast pizza connoisseurs that have longed for a truly tasty, thin crust pizza here in Phoenix, this is the place. Being from Milwaukee that boasts two of the greatest thin crust pizza joints in the world (Zaffiro's and Tomaso's - I can say this because I've eaten at the best in Rome as well), I had given up on finding good pizza in the valley. Finally, I tried Oregano's and it was truly a joy. They now even have Sierra Nevada on tap!

 The pizza has a flawless thin crust, which is crispy throughout, just bubbling up at the edges. The sauce is more than adequate (most places nowadays are dry) and has a nice blend of spices - not overly sweet like many places. Finally, the quality of the cheese is quite good- not like Wisconsin, but I'll give them a pass. And they have REAL, fresh Parmesan cheese, do not pass it up when offered.

 This is my second experience (first in Scottsdale) and both times it was consistent. I will return often, however, I may decide to drive to the one on Camelback -there's  more room and better ambiance."}
{"text":"This is a tough one. This restaurant is a lot of fun, has reasonable prices and very good food. 

Unfortunatley you can expect a wait of 1-2 hours seemingly anytime during the week, night or day. Even take-out usually takes over an hour!

I suppose that's evidence of the restaurant's overall quality, but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad, because they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"So far... no brushetta... ran out. So we got undercooked stuffed mushrooms and undercooked zucchini..."}
{"text":"I like this place especially when it is packed.  They staff seems to be amped up when it is real crowded and what is truly hard to get is when the place is not crowded, the service is not too good.  That is goofy but I am willing to live with that quark.

The take-away service is good but I would *highly* recommend that you NOT call ahead; rather, make the order and ask then to come get you in the bar.  I have found that the take-away orders are worked in with the diner orders - not queued.  They might actually queue the orders, it just doesn't arrive at the take-away desk at the same time. 

I have liked everything ordered.  My advice on anything is to read the menu completely.  The pizza is thin crust but they also have Chicago-style (red sauce on top and think crust).  The appitizers are all good - love the wing variety.

I have gone there MANY times.  Just ask the girls at the take-away station about \"Jeffy\". (big smile)"}
{"text":"Great to have one closer to home. Always great service and the waits aren't usually that long. Food is always wonderful"}
{"text":"It'd been a while since I sat in and ate at this location. This time I called an order in. 

I called to order a roast beef thing, but completely forgot that it was Streets of NY that has that thing...that number 10. I decided to just go with it and ordered the Big Beef. It's super spicy, but I had the poblano peppers and habernaro mayo left off. (Technically, I didn't know the mayo was spicy. It was the waitress on the phone who suggested that it be left off and I'm glad she did...I wanted no heat!) I asked for mushrooms to be added .89c extra. The phone service was great, friendly and accommodating. 

I get to the place and open the back door and greeted by a super friendly waitress who asked me if I came for a pick up. She was getting menus from the outside area. She grabbed them and said follow me. I went to a station inside where she told me someone would be right with me. Another person said, \"I'll be right with you.\" They assisted me seconds later. 

The Big Beef is MASSIVE. (Two meals) Tons of meat and cheese. Served with waffle fries AND a side of coleslaw. I was speechless! 

I got it home and like I said, couldn't eat the whole thing. It was tasty, flavorful, filling and worth every penny! ($12 and some change) Great service, great food. So glad I decided to go with this order when I realized it was the wrong place. I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I do really like Oregano's. It has been around for quite some time now and every time I go it is a good time.
This location right on University is no different. Nice place, smells very good when you walk in , friendly staff.
The food is really great! I have never had a bad meal here.
 Pizza is too good!  Wings and toasted Raviolli  are just what the Dr. Ordered!
I do not have little ones, but I love that they give kids sough to play with while waiting for the food along with crayons and things to color. 
I have to say they think of everything . Nice job!
Bathrooms are clean, but parking is sometimes hard during busy times."}
{"text":"I really do like Oregano's Food. I love the feeling in there, and yes it smells really good in here as well.
A great part of the Holiday Season was if you bought $100.00 in gift Cards you got a $20.00 gift card for yourself as well. It was a great deal. I think it stopped at Christmas but, I do not know for sure.
I love their Pasta, as well as their Pizza, and their salads are very good as well.
The customer Service here is always really good as well.
How can you go wrong here. Great food, good smells and great Customer Service.
 It is a win win!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Bistro Classic tonight. Tomatoes, basil, onions and their 4 cheese blend over a thin crust. Perfect if you're looking for a lighter Pizza. The service was fast. We just love this place!"}
{"text":"Oreganos is very unique Italian eatery. I have never ordered anything here that I did not really enjoy. They're Bellinis are the best I have ever had! But my absolute favorite thing to order here are there meatballs!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed in anything we've ordered from here. Their meatballs are the best in town! And you have to try a Bellini!!  Really fun atmosphere. And the staff always do a really good job. I highly recommend Oregano's if you haven't been before!"}
{"text":"I gotta admit... I love oreganos! It's pretty pricey and there is a 45-60 min wait for the \"Chicago style pizza\" but you can start your fill up on family size shared salads and awesome cheesy garlic bread! The service was awesome and the Sangria rocked! Really the only downfall I have is that they claim to be \"Chicago Style\" & although they do have that delicious cheesy mountain of thick monstrous pizza its honestly not real \"Chicago\" pizza.... but close, I'll give the that!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. If you aren't familiar with Oregano's, than you're wrong and you need to quickly make yourself familiar. The buttery flaky crust, the fresh ingredients and the atmosphere make for a great night out with the lady.
I recommend the Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola Sausage pizza. It's got plenty of meat and cheese with just a hint of heat. One of my fav's..."}
{"text":"One of The best pizza places. The only thing bad the the wait. Some places are worth the wait, this place is on a cliff (not literally). Sometimes you can find yourself waiting for 45 minutes to an hour"}
{"text":"Amazing service, the waiter Jonny was amazing made sure everything was perfect. The pizza was delicious the cheese, crushed tomatoes perfect :) 
Recommend everyone to go at least once."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! Think BIG when you go because everything is plentiful. I've had several of their salads and I never can eat half of them. The pizza? Forget about it! Everyone I've tried has been fantastic! And the cookie pizza gets me every time! You have to try one! ...hot cookie (I prefer the chocolate chip) with three scoops of ice cream! Yuuumm! The bar service was slow, but pleasant staff. I like the indoor/outdoor bar."}
{"text":"The Ziti was on point and our server Aaron did not let our drinks fall below the ice level. Restrooms were clean and had throwback styling within. Thanks"}
{"text":"Let  me preface this review with \"I wanted Oregano's to be better\".
However. Its common knowledge that there are excessive waits here at Oregano's and I assumed that is due to the high quality pizza coming from the kitchen. Well, unless you have a few hours to burn you are not going to find out.
I sat at the bar as I arrived solo and the bartender was friendly and quick. As I looked at the menu and asked for suggestions she alerted me that most items were about an hour wait or sometimes 45 minutes. That being said the only thing you can get in under 30 minutes is their famous \"pizza on a cracker\" dish. They suggest ordering your food while you sit outside waiting for you table. \"That's how the regulars do it\". Apparently this is due to the great pizza shortage in Arizona.
Its not cheap and there is nothing I can see that makes it unique other than they expect you to wait an hour for a 10\" pizza. 
They augment their hard to read menu by NOT offering Calzone or Stromboli. And as an added plus there is not a TV in the joint with any sports whatsoever. (All the TV's show some type of 1940's movie reel) 
This was a Sunday night during the NFL season when the World Series was also being played but I enjoyed the black and white silent movie instead........
How nostalgic! Well that is if nostalgic means sucks. 

And if that was not enough 6 minutes after I ordered a simple pepperoni biscuit I asked about appetizers realizing I would not see the biscuit for 28 minutes.
I ordered BOOM chips and BOOM they never arrived. I promptly cancelled the boom when the pizza arrived. Less boom more pffftt.

Oregano's reminds me of Bucco de Beppo but for pizza......And without the positives that Bucco has, whatever those are???

With all this nonsense I just found myself wanting to bail quickly and even left 3/4 of a beer behind. (Amazing) But the manager did inquire why I did not want to take the remainder of the grease biscuit with me and seemed genuinely concerned. The bartender was also very nice.

The kitchen and time to plate are the Achilles heel. 

Please don't tell me this is the best Arizona can do for pizza. Lord there has got to be a Grimaldi's or Bambini's around here somewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place...tried the Beefstro Salad for the first time its a keeper along with the beef sandwich."}
{"text":"Food was good service was sloooowwww good atmosphere and attentive staff will check it out again"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and have to say that I cannot recommend anything here that is not a pizza. Their Chicago deep dish is pretty great for an Arizona chain and definitely worth the extraordinarily long wait. Did I say wait? Expect at least 45 minutes for your pizza.  Sweet jeebus, this is not five star dining here Oregano's."}
{"text":"My fellow co workers and I frequent here often and are always taken care of. The food and drinks are amazing, and Rachel is always a joy, she's probably one of the main reasons why we come back!!"}
{"text":"Only reason for the low review is we added to the wait list and when we arrived the hosted informed us that she adjusted the wait time from 12-26 minutes to 45- hour. That's a huge discrepancy so we left and went somewhere else. Maybe don't offer a wait list if you are not going to honor he times?"}
{"text":"We had lunch here again on 03/29/2013 around 1PM. Since this was the Friday leading into Easter Weekend, it was busy. My wife left our name and we waited outside for about ten minutes.

Our server was Ramundo and he was excellent. This time my wife ordered the Bistro Calamari @ $6.99 and I did a repeat of the meatball hero @ $9.29. Additionally, we had two soft drinks at $2.49 each with refills.

Since the lunch hour had peaked, our meals arrived fast but we were in no big hurry. The meatball hero is big containing four meatballs. I only ate one complete side and the meatballs from the remaining side. It's enough for two, so maybe next time we'll split it and get a different appetizer. My wife reported that her calamari was very good. Both items arrived HOT temperature wise. The cost was $23.23 + tip. very reasonable for what we ordered."}
{"text":"Great pizza in Arizona! also this place has a great variety of other options (past, salads, ext.).  Nice outdoor seating and a full bar."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!  I ALWAYS sit at the bar because the service is both fun, quick and an experience in itself!!  Truly...food is delicious, drinks are perfect and the staff is amazing!!  (side note but certainly worth stating:  One of the only bars that serve \"fresh squeezed\" greyhounds!!  Literally FRESH...they juice it when you order!!)   If you're trying to eat healthier, we love the side of chicken and brussel sprouts...So good, you might not miss the pizza!!  Serving sizes are ample, price is reasonable... I can't say enough great things!!  * Special shout out to Kinzer, his smile alone will make your day!!   Jeska, Cassie and TJ....  You guys are absolutely the best!!"}
{"text":"Good service but long wait times to be seated and then once you're seated it still takes another 30 minutes to get your dish. Both of our pasta dishes were lacking flavor and Very dry. Definitely needed more sauce and spices. I got the Alfredo in the dark and it was very bland tasting compared to the last time I had it. We were disappointed in the food after all the time we waited.  They get 3 stars for the friendly service."}
{"text":"Picked up a Chicken Parm pizza and kids spaghetti with meatballs on the way home tonight.  Young lady answering the phone took my order efficiently, pleasantly, and read it back to me to confirm.  (Basics, I know, but trust me when I say a lot of places have strayed from these basics). She gave me an estimated time of readiness (25 mins, solid time for me), and off I went.  

Got to store at 23 mins later, young lady (different one by her voice, I think?) also pleasant.  Rang me out, offered me a drink while I waited (say what?) and told me it would be another 5 mins. It wasn't. It was 2 mins, just like originally stated.  When it came out, she went old-school on me and opened the lid to confirm my order. (See comment above on basics).  

Pizza was hot, fresh, and as this was my first time with the Parm Pizza, really tasty! Different than my usual pepperoni, but still flavorful and a nice change.  Kids portion was generous!  Nice takeout container, even came with a little breadstick! Best part? Service with efficiency and courtesy. I haven't frequented this Oreganos a lot yet, but I will now!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very good service. 2nd time I've been here. Food is awesome! Try the rosemary chicken pizza. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I visit Oregano's every time I come to town. Love their Chicago deep dish, it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This review is based soley on the hot chocolate cookie pie with ice cream and the Belini drink... well, and my bartender who was amazing.

My friend who is a Phoenix local took me here to show off one of her favorite spots.

These two things would have me back over and over again.  We sat outside in the patio bar, chatted with our bartender, and sipped on belini's (a drink so strong that they are only allowed to sell 2 of them per drinker).  WOW!  It is a blend of several alcohols that hit the sweet tooth and the sweet spot!  Thank god I was NOT driving!

We had a blast here."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to many  Oraganos's throughout the valley. We really enjoy thier food, but this one was the worst by far... Once seated, we  ordered an appetizer, and the item that ordered  happen to have diced tomatoes in it, we asked if the tomatoes could be left out we were told no problem, after waiting at least 45 minutes or more,  the waiter came and informed us that the item would have the tomatoes after all. He said there was no way to take them out. I told him that any of the other restaurants that we have visited did not have a problem preparing it without the tomatoes. l I also mentioned to him that we had been sitting for at least 45 minutes waiting and obviously the kitchen hadn't even got to make our appetizer since he was just coming to inform us . We said we would take it however the kitchen was going to prepare it and said we were just hungry and wanted it any way they were going to prepare it.. After waiting another 10-15 more minutes the waiter came back over and told us that they hadn't made it yet they were busy in the back picking through it to pull tomatoes out of it. That is gross... So after waiting again another 5 or 10 more minutes the appetizer finally arrived we waited over an hour to get an appetizer.
NOTE: The appetizer is basically a cold plate there was not much cooking involved in preparing the item yet we waited well over an hour for it. Unreasonable!!!
Once our meal was served it was not how we ordered it. As we also ordered a salad which looked like it had been leftover from the night before.  It was extremely limp tasted old and refrigerated. Nothing looked fresh. The lettuce was translucent and pale, the purple onions had no color to them it was a big disappointment.
Waiter acted as if he had other problems didn't seem that bothered by the slow kitchen with our order, nor did he even notice that the order was incorrect. We tipped him 20% but he honestly didn't deserve anymore than 10% at best.. It's his job to make sure our service is at its best!!! Didn't happen..
Will never be back to this location again!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here when I visited her at college and it was delicious! We had to wait a while because it was crowded with people. A fun atmosphere and its well decorated. I had a salad and shared a white chocolate pizza cookie and it was to die for. The service was friendly and fast! Definitely will go back if I ever visit again."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience at another location. This location was amazing !!! I ordered with Paige and she made it so easy and was very professional! When I got here, Martin was quick to assist and informed me the promised time had not been reached yet and my pizza was still in the oven. They offered drinks at the bar to ease my remaining wait time. Joe and Kareem  was quick to grab me a drink and great conversation. My pizza and wings were delivered to me at the bar within the promised time. I will definitely be returning as much as I can. Great place and highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Garnet was a phenomenal hostess. Kind and professional. The food was excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have tons of seating, inside & out. They have heat lamps in the winter. They have amazing customer service and the employees seem to love their jobs! I have had one of almost everything but keep coming back to the chicken alfredothedark because of the serving size, the pablano pepper on top and the fantastic meal the pasta and sauce makes. I have gatherings her with large groups often because they have space and such a large variety for all. You cannot go wrong with the food here and they serve drinks as well ! The dessert cookie with ice cream is something you rarely have room to order because your meal was so fabulously filling. So order it and take it home I say! If they had more stars I would give them hands down! I will always be back oh and fyi..this is the same at all the locations. I have tried Tempe, Mesa & Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Oreganos is always a buzzy, fun place to go.  

 Last night I had a minor issue with wait list process and Nicole (mgr) handled it beautifully.

Thank you for keeping our experience at Oreganos positive!"}
{"text":"Food was good, staff was good... only problem was most of the party I was with ordered from the dinner menu (during Lunch) and was told we could not order a side salad because it was not in the computer to have it with dinner- you can only have it when you order off of the lunch menu...
Makes no sense...our waitress did say we could order the large dinner salad with our meals....  ---it was LUNCH!!!!   Still not sure why a small/side salad can not be offered with the Calzone,  sausage pasta, etc............Manager needs to FIX the computer....."}
{"text":"The food is very good!  Staff was friendly and attentive- The problem We had as a group was---we all ordered a meal - ( Not Lunch menu)  so when we wanted to add a lunch salad we were told - You have to order the huge dinner salad because we did not order off the lunch menu--- Since we obviously spent more for the dinner menu - not sure why the lunch salad that you could add to lunch menu at $2.69 was not available to us --- we were told because ----ITS NOT IN THE COMPUTER!!!  to fix this problem -- couldn't the manager change that....seems like a no brainer to me............Judy C"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.Very friendly staff,Very clean restaurant .It has great pizzas with awesome toppings.I would recommend this place to anyone.Come try it you would love it."}
{"text":"I just want to say this place is amazing, I have been working with aris the manager for about two weeks to set up a surprise party for my wife. He was great, kept in contact the whole time. The original plan was to be on the patio but they moved us inside upgrade!!! The hostess was so sweet and helped my decorate the table and our server Zane was on point. He was very friendly and worked with our food order. He made sure everything was correct for a part of 15. These guys go out of their way to help, I'm glad  I picked this place. Will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Great food! The eggplant parmigiana pasta was delicious. Portions are huge. The pizza cookie for dessert was life-changing. Like I think I had a spiritual experience while eating it. It's a half-baked cookie (I got peanut butter chocolate chip which I highly recommend) with vanilla ice cream on top dusted with cinnamon. You'll probably wanna share because it's huge too."}
{"text":"I love Oreganos. Always have. This location is my favorite. It truly is 'your neighborhood pizza joint'! The staff is so friendly and always remembers their regulars and what they like. And while I'm not a fan of their famous thin crust pizza (I just don't like thin crust, it's not personal) their pastas and salads are to die for. Everything is huge but that's okay because then you always have leftovers. And then there's the trademarked pizza cookie. Lots of places try to copy it but they all fail against oreganos! Try half macadamia nut, half chocolate chip..but order it before you're done eating dinner...a. It takes awhile to cook and b. You might change your mind if you don't because you'll be so stuffed!"}
{"text":"The food is an absolute 5 by far my favorite italian food in the valley but everything else is a freaking 1.  I mean for F's sake can they make these places bigger than college dorm room so the wait is somewhat shorter then the next coming of Jesus Christ himself.  And speaking of the wait, can the 18 year old hoochies that work that ever brain taxing job of taking names and delivering menus actually estimate what the real wait time is.  I have been told 30 mins to wait 75, other times I called and told 30 mins only to walk up 2 mins later and be told 60 mins.  From now on I'll only get this as take out b/c dealing with everything else about this place ruins the experience which is pretty much eating the most amazing italian dishes I've had.  Also note to the manager; it's summer in Arizona.  Keep the misters on the the patio on at all times!!!!.  I don't care if a family of buffalo sized snooty Scottsdale folk is complaing that their table is damp.  As you could tell by the overall applause by everyone on the patio when they were turned back on, the family that resembled their meatballs were in the minority when wanting the misters off ."}
{"text":"In short: Great pizza and Italian food, if you don't mind the crowd and waiting a bit.

I've been going here for the last 5 years, it's close by to my place so I usually just drop by in the off hours for a bite to eat.  It's pretty conveniently located near Mill and University, close by to all the bars at Mill.  The atmosphere is great, very relaxed and casual, without the usual pompous and fake Italian restaurant feel.  It is full of college kids most of the time, so atmosphere is a bit more lively than most other family restaurants.  You have the choice of sitting at the bar, inside booths or an outside table.  I like it outside as long as it's not in the summer, but they do have misters and shade so it's not all that bad.  Like some of the other reviewers noted, wait time can exceed even an hour around peak dinner and lunch times.  If you go off peak say around an hour after the usual lunch or dinner times, then you can get seated right away or maybe a 15 min wait at max.  

The pizza is the best thing here, there's a bunch of choices or you can build your own.  I'm quite fond of the Frisco and the '45 minute wait' stuffed crust.  But I recommend having an appetizer or two before dinner, I love the wings (Wings of fire and Royal gold are the best) or the garlic bread.  Another good starter is the Beafstro salad but it's a humongous plate of beef and salad, the best of all worlds.  I also like their numerous sandwiches, and various pasta combinations.  Baked ziti is amazing and like pretty much every other item on the menu it's huge.  You should definitely top your experience off with a pazookie for dessert, it's absolutely delicious, I get one every time I go.

The prices are great too, their 18\" pizzas is about 20$ and it'll comfortably feed 2-4 depending on how hungry you are.  Also you can definitely share any of the other items, making this place a perfect place to have a very cozy and intimate meal."}
{"text":"We both order the Italian sub it was supposed to have three different meat it only had one! And it was not great BMT at Subway way better and half the cost. We won't go back their prices are high and not great food."}
{"text":"What can I say I am in shock finding a decent Italian pizza place in Scottsdale! It is not New York pizza or Italian food but service and ambiance was 5 star.

I started with calamari. It was ok which is not bad. The serving was huge. Then I had the eggplant parm, which I thought was pretty good.

My girlfriend had some cheese bread and a deep dish pizza. She loved it and the portions were large. 

The food was 4 star but the service staff and large portions make this a 5 star experieince"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great prices! We always get 2 dishes and share along with a pizza. The big rig & Alfredo in the dark are delish! Dirty monkey even better  we always get great service but Andrew and his manager were super sweet and on top of things. Amazing service!!"}
{"text":"At Oregano's, you will hear that same Louis Prima song on repeat during your entire dining experience, but at least you'll get good service. 

Actually, I pretty much love Oregano's for their Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola pizza an order of their nice, meaty wings with mixed sauce.  Oregano's is one of the only places I've been to that allows you to mix their wing sauces.  I love the Italian Gold wings there, a little sweet, honey-ish, salted perfectly, but I also like the Wings of Fire, the hottest selection there.  But get this, if you ask them, they'll mix the two sauces together, so you get this awesome giant, meaty wing covered in this brilliant sweet and spicy sauce.  It's sort of like sex but only a chicken wing. 

I feel like I hear people bitch about the price a lot but to me, it's pretty much perfect for what you get.  It's a littler pricier than a place like Streets of New York, but the service and food is better, it's a little less than somewhere like Pizzeria Bianco or Le Grande Orange, but again, it's a little less, you know, delicious as those places.  It's also a great place to take out of town folk since it's a local chain, yet always consistent and generally there is something everyone will like.

Personally, I don't mind the long waits for a table on the weekends.  Once, I brought an uncle and cousin I hadn't seen in years there and it was actually sort of nice grabbing beers from the bar and catching up while we waited for our table.  In any dining setting, I doubt mind waiting as long as something delivers. 

Which the place does.  If you can handle the Louis Prima."}
{"text":"Tabitha did an excellent job! She is very friendly and professional. Very welcoming. The food was great! 

The Lady Scampy is excellent!"}
{"text":"What I love about Oregano's is that it never disappoints. The staff is always friendly, the food is always good, and the wait is long enough that you have time to enjoy a glass of wine (or two) before sitting down to dinner. I've been going to Oregno's for many years now and except for the time my car got towed from in front of the knitting shop, I've never had a bad experience.

Don't come to Oregano's if you're looking for nothing but food. Oregano's is all about the experience -- fun and casual, but not exactly a quick bite to eat. Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato Pizza is THE best and the Pasta Basta rocks, too."}
{"text":"I love this place...Great place to go and grab lunch or even dinner. All of the Oreganos have a great patios and this one in particular actually has a very large indoor dining room as well for those of you who prefer the inside. My personal favorite here is the Italian gold wings, the honey mustard BBQ sauce is so delicious that I almost always order these as the main dish. Oh and lets not forget the oh so cheesy garlic bread that is about the length of my who arm it is so tasty... We also love the meatball sandwich and if you like chicken caesar salads you have to try theirs it is topped with shaved chicken that has such great flavor its definitely better than your typical grilled chicken most restaurants have. Overall this is one of my favorite spots for an afternoon lunch when the weather is nice so we can enjoy the patio and don't forget to try their peach bellini !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.. luv the drinks and the huge meatballs.. a must have... yummm excited to get stuffed"}
{"text":"I visited here last Sunday afternoon with my ex-husband.  We ordered a Pan Crust  pizza and were told it would take 45 minutes to an hour.  I was pretty hungry so I also ordered the Shrimp Caesar Salad, that I got a glimpse of as a waiter carried one past us, to nibble on during the long wait for pizza.  

The salad was ok....mostly lettuce and dressing.  There were about a dozen nicely seasoned shrimp on it but certainly not enough for size or the cost of the salad.  

The pizza was ok too, but it was NOT worth waiting 45 minutes for...nor was the whole meal worth $50.00+ for one 12\" pizza, one salad and one iced tea!"}
{"text":"In town for Padres Spring Training and read the other yelp reviews. Must say the reviews were right. This place has a great selection of thin crust, stuffed and Chicago style pizza. They have good lunch specials also. Had the puerto penasco carne pizza and garlic cheese bread. It did not disappoint. Will definitely return here to eat next spring training."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in a while because every time I do, the service is poor and the food has been average.  Tonight I called in to do a pick up order and got placed on hold twice and continuously asked what I was calling for.  After telling the lady what I wanted to order she asked if that was all, and I said yes and then she said \"it will be ready in 20 minutes\" and hung up. I didn't know the cost of my order and I didn't like being hung up on.  When arriving to pick up my order. I was handed half my order and then ignored until I had to ask when I was going to get my pizza (10 minutes after I received my appetizer).  By the time I got home the food was cold. I just don't know if ill go back. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"This Italian joint is better than any other I have tasted. The prices weren't too ridiculous either. The lasagna was fantastic and the bread sticks are to dies for. I'm sad there isn't one in the L.A area. I'm so glad my brother introduced me to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the customer service at the take out counter. For one, Miguel the guy who took my order over the phone was very unpleasant and rude. Apparently there has been recent changes to the menu that he failed to explain and as a result, when I picked up my order it was incorrect.  When I kindly asked questions his tone was very unpleasant and rude and you could tell he was not happy to be taking my order and wanted to get off the phone. When I asked questions after paying to the cashier Senyaceth, she was quick to get the manager when all I asked were simple questions regarding my order. Afterwards, she was very unhappy that I had to reorder my meal and was rude the entire time. Never asked for anything free, and I paid for my entire meal. I understand Saturday nights are busy, I myself work in the customer service industry and agree that it gets very busy. However, that's not an excuse to be unpleasant and rude.  As a frequent at Oreganos I am highly disappointed and hope there customer service returns to what it used to be."}
{"text":"Flew in from Indy to spend some time with family.  What a great place to make some memories. The Clark Street pizza was out of this world- a thin crust pizza loaded with sausage and pepperoni. The crust was perfect and paper thin. The sauce was good and the meat is everything that a grown man desires. We had the bistro salad that was oddly kind of spicy. Tossed in a sweet and spicy dressing that exceeded my expectations. Service was excellent.  Thank you Kelly! Try it! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have not been to Oregano's in 7 years, and now I remember why.  The pizza is not that great.  I am not a fan of their crust, however my twins are, and that is the only reason why they are ok in my book. I had the margarita pizza, the crust was so bland, the good thing was I ate only two small slices, so I didn't feel bad. I will come back if I am tired of other choices.  The twins ate everything.  My little boy even \"thanked\" the server for the yummy pizza.  The poor boy has no taste, but what can you do, he is only 4."}
{"text":"I had only discovered this Arizona pizza chain restaurant recently despite having lived in Arizona for a while. The garlic bread here that I tried is actually quite good especially with the marinara sauce which they make in house. However, the Chicago thin crust pizza was slightly disappointing. In the end I still prefer the NY thin crust style pizza but that may just be a personal preference than anything else. While the male bartender was extremely nice and easy going I don't think Oregano's is worth the hype to me. I'm also aware that they do serve deep dish pizza but there is a long wait time for that.

With so many pizza restaurants in Scottsdale it's unsure as to whether or not I'll come back here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Sunday lunch today. I had Alfredo the Dark and he had the Veggie Pesto sandwich. Loved the pasta but not the meatballs that sorely lacked some seasoning. Sandwich was good but neither of us were fans of the cole slaw. The waitress said that everyone hates the coleslaw so I hope they do something about it soon. Service was fast and friendly the entire time and even though they accidentally  gave us the wrong check they quickly corrected their error. Overall it was a great family atmosphere and we would go back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, every time I go to any location. Really good. Not as good as my Mothers of course. I mean hey, I am Italian, no to go food is as good as mamma's.
Yes, there is a wait on a busy night,but worth it.

Good selection of red wines, the kind we like, and wonderful pasta.
Chicken lasanga is about the only chicken dish I really like.
It smells good in here. Like a real Mamma Mia Kitchen!
Good place, staff is hard working. You cannot go wrong with this place. Or any of the Oregano's actually!
Always have so much food left over, it is great to have the next day."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday evening and there was no wait at all.  The servers were really friendly.  Although I would not go there again.  The pizza while okay did not overcome the extreme greasy tough  Beefstro Salad..   They forgot to put on the tomato which may have helped cut the grease that coated my lips and mouth. One of the worst salads I have ever had. The pizza cookie was generous in size, three of us shared it, it needed to be cooked a few minutes more.

I am glad we did not have to wait as there is no air conditioned waiting area.  To wait in the heat would have been horrible."}
{"text":"I'm still full after eating here. The food is really good and the service is wonderful. We ordered the bruschetta to start and then ordered a pizza and their alfredo pasta. The bill wasn't ridiculous and we had a ton of leftover food. 

I agree that the parking lot sucks, but that's Oregano's for you."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time this past Sunday afternoon. We're new to the area and up until this point had not found a good pizza place. The food here was delicious. We ordered the garlic cheese bread and cheese pan pizza, both were amazing. The garlic bread was a meal in itself and arrived pretty quickly. The pan pizza exceeded my expectations. I especially enjoyed the crust which was buttery and flakey, something I had never experienced before. The cheese was gooey and fresh, and the sauce was well seasoned. 

Our server was polite and attentive. He let us know that the pizza would take up to 40 minutes. We decided to stick it out and just relax and enjoy the experience. The appetizer came out quickly, and the pizza did not take 40 minutes, more like 25 or so. I loved the food and highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is always great, the managers are always there to help which is amazing, and the food is so delicious! Coming here is always a great food and service experience! Oh and remember to get the pizza cookie, they're so good."}
{"text":"A friend from work and I had the displeasure of dining here for lunch today. We're only given an hour for lunch, but we thought that would give us plenty of time since we came right at 11am. We ordered the large Caesar salad to share. We asked for ADDITIONAL dressing on the side. What we got was the salad with NO dressing on it and one tiny container on the side. Clearly not what we asked for, but we improvised and just asked for additional containers so we could eat. And then we waited....waited....nothing. Finally had to flag down a bus boy to get our original server to explain what happened and why we needed more. He seemed dazed and confused, but got us some additional dressing cups. Salad out of the way, we waited on the pizza we ordered. And we waited.....and waited....finally it arrives. We asked for a thin crust pepperoni with mushrooms on half of the pizza. What came to us was a PAN pizza, and to top it off, the mushrooms were hidden so we had no idea which half of the pizza they were on. Again, dazed and confused server was told about the pizza mix up. He argued with my friend that this was what we ordered and then took the pizza back to the kitchen to discern which side the mushrooms were on. Rather than reject it and send it back for what we originally ordered, we decided to eat it because it had taken so long we were now late getting back to work. The pizza was WAY over salted, much too much oregano on it to the point it was hideous tasting. I choked half my slice down and was done. Server never apologized for anything that went wrong, nor any offers to take the wrong pizza off the bill. Terrible service and terrible pizza. Does this place even have a manager? We won't be back."}
{"text":"It's always a great meal here, generous portions and great prices, but tonight we had the pleasure of Briana as our server and she went above and beyond!  Definitely planning to come back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"From the time we arrived to the time we walked out the door we felt very welcome by all staff members. The food was amazing and a great value. On a side note, my daughter left her phone and when I called they had already put it aside. Honest and friendly! Thank you."}
{"text":"i seriously don't get it. it's not very good pizza. the pizookie is the highlight. that AND their diet coke is the perfect mix of carbonation and syrup in a huge cup. BUT give me Venezia's over this ANY day"}
{"text":"Amina, our server, made our evening the most enjoyable! Food was amazing, but she was a five star!!!! Spoke to the manager, Luis, on our way out to inform him of the great service Amina provided and I said they need more Aminas working here and the other staff around laughed. Found it very disrespectful that the manager allowed this as Amina was there as well. Just another form of bad behavior in our society. Hope Amina finds a job where she is respected by here peers as she's a wonderful server!"}
{"text":"One of our favs for pizza!!!!! However, Renee was amazing as our Server!!!! Thank you Renee for making my evening with my Parents so enjoyable!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is my families favorite place to eat. Every time I am in town from Dallas I make sure to come here. The thin crust and salad along with pretty much the whole menu is amazing and affordable!"}
{"text":"Love this Oreganos!!!! Even better than the ziti and the pizza and the salad though is out waitress, Kayla. LOVE HER!!!! So kind, so sweet, so charismatic. Give that girl a RAISE!!!!!! Will be back."}
{"text":"When deciding on a place to go to dinner for my birthday, I decided to go to one of my usual favorites: Oregano's. This time, instead of going to one of the two Tempe locations, we decided to head out to the Chandler location for a change of scenery.

Like all Oregano's there's a good vibrant atmosphere and the staff is always friendly. The inside was a a little cold for us so we decided to go sit on the patio. The bar tender greeted us and wished us a good meal as we were taken out to the patio and later wished us a good night as we left. The patio at the Chandler location is probably the biggest patio I've seen so far as far as Oregano's goes. Very wide spread with a fire pit in the middle for the winter and two high power mister fans running to keep us cool. Was nice to be able to enjoy the fresh air without being cramped or dying from the heat.

Our waitress AJ was extremely friendly and was very helpful when recommending drinks on the menu. Even though it was the day before her day off, she did a great job of checking in on us, making sure our drinks were filled, and even took the time to chat with us, all the while juggling the other five tables in the same fashion. So major kudos to her for how well she did.

For starters, the girl and I got drinks. Meagan got the red sangria and I got the D'Liscious Rootbeer Float. I'm not a big wine fan but the Sangria was very good. A nice blend of fruit and wine. Definitely had a kick but was blended very well. The rootbeer float was very good as well. A blend of rootbeer and rum it definitely had that rum taste I like without being overpowering so even Meg enjoyed it, who normally isn't a fan of these kind of drinks.

Along with the drinks we also got the Oregano's Favorite Salad. I'm glad we agreed to split a Jr. size because if we hadn't we wouldn't have had room for dinner. This salad is huge. The regular size can feed a family of seven. The Jr is big enough for three to four people to share. The Oregano's Favorite is very well named. It has a nice mix of ingredients and toppings, including raisins, giving it a slightly sweet taste. It's one of our favorite standbys when we go to any Oreganos.

For Dinner, we got another one of our favorites: The Big Rig Pasta. This pasta has got a great kick to it. Just spicy enough to be enjoyable without sacrificing flavor. We always get the Big Rig with the two spicy sausages. For three bucks more, I don't think I could find sausage this tasty and spicy. I recommend slicing them up into bite size pieces and mixing it in with the pasta. Always a great choice.

And as if that were not enough, AJ got us a Pizza Cookie for us after Meg let her know it was my birthday. We got the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie since is one of my favorites. In Meg's words, Don't know who's idea it was to make these, but they should be slapped for making everyone fat XD The damn thing is addictive and extremely tasty. And why wouldn't it be? Half baked jumbo cookie with three ice cream scoops on it? What's not to like? Should definitely be split with three or more people if you plan on finishing it (not like that stopped us).

All and all, it's always a good time coming to Oregano's, no matter the location."}
{"text":"Salad came out with lettuce that was well past the point of being wilted - it was rotten - slimy black lettuce in some areas of the salad. Sent it back and it came out the same way the second time. Server suggested that we \"pick those parts out\" of the salad. Really ?! Manager finally fixed it, but nothing was comp'ed.  Bad, bad."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, what an awesome place to get Italian food!! Went there twice, was extremely satisfied both times. What amazing customer service they have there, our server Ariel was extremely friendly and helpful. She was so nice and explained to us about the menu. The other time we got the to-go order and this guy name Cody was super friendly as well. Can't be happier with the experiences that I had. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"The service sets this place apart, always top notch!  Pizza and calzones are really good but it takes a 30-45 minutes because it is made from scratch.  Salads are great and huge and much quicker than the oven items.  The heck of a slice is a great lunch as well it is out in 5-10 minutes leaving lots of time to get back to work."}
{"text":"Oregano's has huge salads, pasta and great pizzas.  They have amazing customer service on par with any high end restaurant.  I can recommend any of their salads, pasta or their Italian Gold wings are super moist and tasty. One of my favorite pizzas in the valley is their Clark Street meat pizza!  It is a little pricey but really good,"}

{"text":"My absolute favorite place to go anytime for any celebration or just a casual meal. I have not heard a negative thing about any item on the menu. I love their Alfredo the Dark pasta, Beef Bistro Salad and half macadamia nut and half chocolate chip pizookie. Service is always fantastic. Prices reasonable

Only annoying issue: unusually small parking lot."}
{"text":"I finally got Oregano's off my \"to do\" list. I was impressed with my Chicago Beef sandwich, the service & decor. The Shea Blvd location is convenient, customer friendly and comfortable. I'll be back.. In fact, I've already been back, this time for their meatball creation. Better than advertised, their sauce completed another tasty lunch. Oregano's deserves their impressive reputation."}
{"text":"I don't eat a lot of italian food because I'm afraid of all the regrets I'll have when I step on the scale next day, but wow. This place is amazing. It has an amazing atmosphere and really nice staff. We ordered takeout but one of the orders was mixed up and they were extremely courteous and prompt in fixing everything. The food is incredible! DEFINITELY GET A PIZOOKIE."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here several times and there is usually a wait. The wait is well worth the great service, awesome food and reasonable prices. We usually order pizza, wings, salad, beer and of course a pizookie! All so delicious!"}
{"text":"Took way to long... , throwing food around in kitchen along with unsanitary touching of ready to eat food, specifically the garlic bread. Would not recommend this location. They seem too comfortable. Cooks didn't even know we ordered so the waitress had to tell them twice."}
{"text":"We have been to this location a couple times to celebrate special occasions and every time we had been a pleasant time, however tonight we decided to have just a normal family dinner, no special occasion and Kevin (the manager) and his staff went above and beyond on their customer service. Erica was waitress and she was great.  We moved into the neighborhood a year ago,around the same time they open this Oregenos and we plan to continue to keep coming in the future. Great staff,good food."}
{"text":"Saturday Late Afternoon Lunch. Thin crust pizza and salad. My pizza was so thin the oil from the cheese dripped on my plate. The Caesar salad was so big, too big and the salad dressing was tasteless. I really felt cheated for this $30+ meal.   I'm reading all the good reviews but I must say my experience was just so-so from the time I walked into the door. 

Menus are very worn and hard to read with all that red type happening.

My server was way more attentive to the regulars across from me. He never checked back as to ask how everything was. Never ask to refill my beverage until the end. When he came to our table he asked if we needed a box and we said yes and then he quickly removed our dishes to be boxed...oh were you still eating.. I thought he would bring the box to the table. 

Good service can save a bad meal and a Good meal can save bad service...We had neither. I am never come back."}
{"text":"I love Oreganos but not this one, I ordered a Pablo Picasso salad through postmates. When my salad got here I didn't get the chicken that came with it. I called the restaurant, they could not figure it out. So they told me to re order it again through Postmates and it would be taken care of. But after I called and told them that I was going to get re charged they said that was out of there hands I would have to go in and get a brand new order. Then the manager offered me a gift card told me she was going to send it to me and she never did send it to me. I love oreganos, but the service they have give me at this location, is not worth the stress."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite pizza place to come to in the Scottsdale area! I have been during lunchtime and dinner time and there is always a wait and I can say it is definitely worth the wait! 

Dinner: They have a large menu with large sized portions to allow for equal sharing with your party. The calamari is thin and crispy, and the cheesy bread is a favorite, it's delicious. They have a wonderful salad selection with the Caesar being a personal favorite that isn't overloaded with anchovy taste. The pizza here is the real deal; they can make any size pizza with a wonderful array of toppings, and the menu options are excellent. the Stuffed pizza is a deep dish take on pizza loaded with flavors and should be tried if you can handle the cheese. My favorite is the thin crust pizza that isn't too thin to be crispy bread, but keeps it's crunchiness with a soft bite. The Bistro Classic is a mouthwatering white pizza and the Aunt Margherita is one of the best Margherita pizzas I've ever had. 

Dessert: The Pizza cookie is an absolute must and I have overheard people saying that they will wait an hour just to be seated and enjoy one. Chocolate chip used to be my favorite, but the Salted Caramel might have recently best it out. I was informed last time that they can even do half and half so you can eliminate the stress of the choice. The cookie is in its own personal pizza dish and has lumps of delicious vanilla ice cream and chocolate chips; the perfect additions for a flavor explosion!

Consensus: The wait may be long but it's for a good reason; the large portions and delicious pizzas that are crafted have some of the best flavors that take you to Chicago or Rome. Dive in but save room for the desert!"}
{"text":"this place is fantastic... they have a huge menu (literally)... they have numerous pastas, pizzas, salads, and sandwiches... everything here is large and cheap... which is not common in scottsdale i promise... there are 2 things that remind me how much i love this place... first off i always order their picasso salad, i am not a salad person, but this thing is made for a man, they are not skimpy with the ingredients loads of chicken cheese and onions with an amazing tangy chipotle ranch dressing this thing is enough for 2 people... 2nd, i am also not traditionally a thin crust person but they have some of the best thin crust pizza i have ever had, i could eat an entire one to myself. you can not leave here without a pazookie dessert,  its a fresh baked cookie with a few scoops of ice cream on top... thats all i need to say..."}
{"text":"We're from out of town, but the in-laws who live out in the northern corner of Buckeye love this place, so we made the treck. The food here is pretty good, for a casual dining \"pizza bistro\" as they call it, but not amazing.  We ordered the trademark cheesey bread, because how can you not.  It's decent, but the sauce served with it had a metallic taste to it, which reminded me of tomatoes left in an open tin can for too long.  Otherwise it's just cheese and butter and garlic: hard to screw up too bad.

I ordered the smallest of one of their signature giant salads.  The thing is obscene.  There was enough to feed four people.  I don't really understand who they're targeting with this.  I like getting my money's worth, but when i have to box up or throw away more than half of it because there's just no way a human body can consume that much plant fiber in one sitting, you're not saving any money.  Maybe some people like soggy, day-old salad.  This is your heaven, then.

The margherita pizza was ok, too.  The thin crust is very thin and cracker-like.  Not my thing, but if it's yours, it's also a good value, even if the tomatoes seemed lackluster for a place that grows them by the acre a few miles down the road.

A red-sauce Italian place like this truly lives or dies on the quality of its chicken parmesan.  That tells you everything you need to know.  The portion was, again, generous, but not overly so.  The breaded and crispy, without tasting overly fried.  Not the best I've had, but not the worst.  I was again disappointed, however, with the tomato sauce.  Maybe it was just me on that particular day, but all i could think of was Prego with pennies (not penne).

For a Minnesotan in February, it was nice to eat outside for a change, and the atmosphere was friendly enough on a late afternoon before the dinner rush.  We weren't subjected to the long waits that other reviewers have mentioned.  If that was the case, I guess you just tough it out or go to the Olive Garden across the street.  I'd put the two on about equal footing with Oregano's just slightly edging out the mega-chain. Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"One word, YUM!  In addition to the meatballs and Brussels sprouts, I sampled the guaca-tony, ordered by my friend. 
The Brussels sprouts were very flavorful. The meatballs were moist and the sauce was very good. They were a bit too generous with the cheese, but I am not complaining. I highly recommend the guaca-tony. Think thin crust cheese pizza with a giant dollop of guacamole! Indescribably delicious. 
This was not my first visit to Oreganos, and won't be my last, once again they delivered!"}
{"text":"One of the original Oreganos locations in the state. Tucked away in the lot on the southeast corner of Shea and Scottsdale. I continuously always order either the Beef Bistro salad (amazinggg) or the Alfredo the Dark. The beef bistro is a spicy spinach beef salad, really great never had anything like it. 
Alfredo the dark is their spicy version of Alfredo pasta.
Of course you can't come to Oreganos and not get a pizookie! Absolutely one of the best desserts I've ever had - and I have a sweet tooth. Only $5!"}
{"text":"I HAVE to come to Oregano's every time I come to Phoenix. This local chain is one of my favorite spots. Many many of their dishes are delicious, but my TOP two are the Alfredo the Dark and the Big Beef Bistro salad - mmm hungry just thinking about them! 

The servers and overall customer service at all Oregano's is always very friendly, helpful and cheery. ALL dishes are 1.5-2x normal portions so you can definitely share (or not and take it home to eat again!). The Alfredo and Beef Bistro both have a spicy kick to them which I love; and its not an overwhelming spice."}
{"text":"Amazing tasting food. Highly recommend. Pastas are relatively inexpensive compared to other restaurants and super delicious. Pizza is great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I can never go wrong with Oregano's.  It's our go to place when we want to have a nice dinner out but don't want to spend too much.  He LOVES their El Diablo pasta.  I do enjoy it as well, but it IS spicy.  I typically can't have a biteful without burning up.  My favorite go to is the Big Rig pasta.  We also love their pizzas and their thin crust.  This location is very convenient for us and has great parking space, unlike the location in Tempe and Mesa.
I do wish that they had more dry towels for cleaning up.  Every time we go in, they will clean off a table for us, and leave it wet and sticky.  We always have to get someone to come back and wipe it dry for us.  I would be nice to have it dry as a regular thing to do when cleaning off a table.  But other than that, I really have nothing bad to say!"}
{"text":"Really, Really RUDE hostesses today. Walked in about 4:00PM before they got busy. We were told they were setting up a table for 5 of us. A couple minutes later we were told our wait would be 20 minutes. Fine - we'll wait. Another couple minutes later two groups of equal size that walked in behind us were seated and we were informed that \"all big tables have been seated and our wait would now be an hour\". I pointed right at an empty booth for 6 and asked about that one. They said they're getting ready to seat it. These girls were snotty and condescending. We usually like this place. Never had this kind of problem before. We left and went across the street to try ZinBurger. Thanks Oregano's for turning us on to an amazing burger and salad place."}
{"text":"For all the hype, I don't really see this place as anything above average. The wings are okay at best. The pizza is obviously the star here, but even that doesn't net more than 4 stars. I just think if a place is going to be know for its pizza, it should really blow my socks off. All that said, it's still an okay place."}
{"text":"We've been ordering Oregano's for years. We love the food, but they continually screwup! Tonight we ordered takeout food, and for the third time this year, no exaggeration, we got home, settled in for dinner and found that we were missing items that we paid for... how hard could it be to double check the order and ensure accuracy?"}
{"text":"Their deep dish pizza is simply to die for; if you don't order this, don't bother coming at all!!

Okay, that was a bit exaggerated. As an AZ raised/Chicago born diner I've been coming here for years, and in reality there are some kickass starters. For example, try the calamari and MMMMM cheesy garlic bread loaf. Honestly, I almost never eat any of the other entrees or pizza types anymore because my heart belongs to good old Chicago deep dish.

A lot of people don't order my type of pizza because they have to wait so long, but here's a pro tip: order your pizza about 20 mins before arriving at the restaurant. Yes, you can do that. This enables you to sit down and enjoy your meal without starving for a 50 minute wait or fighting off your hunger demons with appetizers.

I always order the Chicago style spinach pizza, and never do I come home without leftovers. Small girls like me can't consume more than two slices at a time, lol!"}
{"text":"Always love going here while visiting Phoenix area.  Calamari appetizer could use a little more flavor in the breading but what do you expect in Arizona ?  Other appetizers are good (breads and guac).  Salads and sandwiches are huge.  Too bad my family won't eat deep dish pizza.  It's in my blood growing up in Chicago but who can tackle a pie on their own ?  Pasta Basta with chicken is my go-to favorite.  A Greek twist on pasta."}
{"text":"SLOW SERVICE for larger parties. No reservations so we had 4 people go an hr early to check in, when our whole party got there they told us they'd start saving tables!!! They didn't tell us the hour before!! Had to wait ANOTHER hour to finally be seated and our group was split up. We weren't able to eat together. 
Only like 6 tables inside. Otherwise you will be eating outside."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat pizza in the valley. Every flavor of pizza rocks. Live the decor. Heat lamps outside. Nice."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are good and be sure to get here by 1130 at the latest or you'll be standing in line. Make sure to ask for Timmy, he is unforgettable. Tell him his Friday regulars sent you.... 

I haven't tried much other then te pizza and the pizookie, which is freaking amazing !!!
Give it a shot, it's worth the effort"}
{"text":"I love Oregano's food! The Antipasto salad, pablo picasso, stuffed chicago pizza, thin crust pizza, alfredo the dark, big rig, mamas sausage and peppers....However, this location's service is not up to par. They are not that friendly, and the food takes a long time even if I'm not ordering a 45 minute pizza. If the service would get better, I'd like to return."}
{"text":"Read reviews and still decided to have lunch there today, have never eaten at any Oregano's! Guess I did not miss anything, had the chicken parmigiana, it was so dry, way over cooked , even a little black on one end! Pasta was so dry, the sauce was under the chicken but not a lot of it! Probably the worse chicken parmigiana I have ever eaten! The sauce was a bit spicy which I try to avoid, but would overlook that if the chicken had been juicy! The bread was not great they served with it! Hubby was not happy with his pasta either so for what we paid did not think it was worth it! People waiting to get in when we left all I can say is the pizza must be good the pasta is not! But I do want to commend our server, she was really great, kept our glasses full of tea, (we really needed it) she was helpful with our questions about menu too! Probably won't be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at the Boulders Resort & Spa and were craving Italian/pizza nearby. We stumbled on this little town of Cave Creek. Went to Oregano's. Crowded but we got seated right away cause there were just 2 of us. Really cute restaurant and outdoor patio area. We ordered thin crust pizza, spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs & salad for appetizers. My husband said the meatballs were some of the best he's had. He also loves their house italian dressing. Pizza was awesome. Would definitely go back. Our waitress was super friendly and it was a great experiencw"}
{"text":"I loved eating here and I would give it 5 stars but the wait was too long. It was only like 4pm and there was a long wait! But I must say the dessert was so good. If you ever had a Pazookie from BJ's this place has it but its 10x better!

My husband had the Baked Ziti.. .I wish I had it b/c I kept stealing his food from him :("}
{"text":"Great. Amazing food. Price is totally worth it. Fresh cooked to order. Original Italian American food. Staff is friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Not much to say here, but if you haven't tried Oregano's yet... stop what you're doing and go now!  They have a huge menu with tons of tasty stuff to choose from.  We almost always split a large whole wheat thin crust pizza and have a couple tall sunshine wheat beers; it's a little greasy and full of calories, but its comfort food at its best.   I have also tried their pastas, veggie sandwich and fried ravioli's too, and was equally as pleased.  The menu is very inexpensive for the portion sizes, and the service is always good.  I would recommend either getting there early or plan on waiting for a while, because it is always packed."}
{"text":"This is one of the most unique restaurants we have been to.  The menu is so diverse and has many items that were so unique.  Try the Veggie Weggie--nothing like it anywhere.  And there service is quick and friendly.  We arrived for lunch ten minutes before they were to opened and were sitting with 4 other groups waiting for 11.  They noticed us waiting and opened early so we would not be waiting.  Nice touch.  You can't find these places anywhere back east or in Calif., so if you are traveling, treat yourself before u leave town."}
{"text":"We all had the famous Gibbilini Bellini is was so yummy. You won't be disappointed if you order it. The Italian Flag Lasagna was so delicious. If you're craving something with shrimp must try El Diablo Shrimp Pasta. But our favorite was Uncle Franks Sausage Pesto."}
{"text":"Try the Italian Gold Wings the best and most unique flavor i ever had. Pizza is pretty good but not my favorite. My wife got the diablo pasta w shrimp and she loved it. Very awesome service is a plus with them here."}
{"text":"I never have anything to complain about at Oregano's! My husband and I ordered a bbq chicken pizza for dinner, it was absolutely fantastic! All the staff is so kind and courteous."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and every time the food is excellent. My girlfriends and I usually get a salad and pizza to share and it is plenty of food.  The thin crust on the pizza is amazing.  The last time we went we got the Pazookie for dessert and it was A-MAZ-ING.  I almost gave this a 5 star review based on the cookie alone."}
{"text":"Above average food, fun atmosphere, very good service, fun theme.  Great value.  Pizza was good, pesto pasta dish was good, Caesar Salad was huge and could be a meal by itself.  A great place for a casual diner and some wine."}
{"text":"Wow...  I am from Chicago and ordered a thin crust from here. A m a z I n g. My mouth is still watering. I will always return when I go back to Scottsdale. I was super skeptical ordering a pizza in Arizona however oreganos is spot on. Keep up the good work. Great fresh ingredients. Quality pizza. And btw...my husband had the sausage and peppers and it was awesome. Go here!  Wish I had one in the Chicago area."}
{"text":"I need balance in my life, which is why I love the pizza cookie here.  The yin of the freshly baked brownie bottom fused the yang of the chocolate chip ice cream on top...delicious.  I used to come here in groups when I lived in on campus just for a late-night snack. Great for people on the see-food diet.."}
{"text":"Always super packed, I would go before you get really hungry because its always an hour wait then an hour till your food gets there.

Its worth it though. 

There is no hydrogenated oil in the pizza dough, so thats good.

The lasagna is good and the pizza is very good.

The stuffed pizza is totally disqusting though. They dont make it like a pie,weird right?"}
{"text":"Great food! Pizza is really delicious--- thin crust, cheesy and filling. The portions are big and the servers are really friendly. The desert is amazing!!! Get the peanut butter cookie sundae--- a gooey cookie with melting ice cream...yum!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Oregano's. Based on recommendations from friends, and reviews of other locations, I was disappointed.

Unlike most of the reviews, I had absolutely no wait because I called in the order to go. The lady who answered the phone was very pleasant, but was puzzled as to why I didn't want marinara sauce with my calamari and garlic bread. I'm not a fan of sauces.

I should have trusted my instinct and passed on the food that apparently had a \"sauce requirement\", but I was hungry and wanted calamari. The menu said \"calamari rings\" but it was strips, with way too much breading. I won't grade down on the sogginess, mainly because it was in a plastic container, steaming hot, for 15 minutes before I ate it. Sogginess aside, the calamari was more breading than meat, and just laid there staring at me, wondering why I didn't smother it in the required marinara sauce. The garlic bread was average. 

The staff was pleasant, the portion sizes are good for the price, and there was reasonable parking, but since it was almost 8pm that should be a given.  I may try Oregano's again, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's and my hubby and I go to various locations throughout the valley. Every time we order takeout from this location we have nothing but problems and bad service. Today: our order took 45 minutes longer than promised. After finally asking the young lady to check again she laughed and said \"oh it's been ready a while now\". The meatballs in our order were so badly burned they tasted like feet so we had to throw those out.  Also, while waiting a lady came in to pick up pizza and the toppings were wrong so it had to be redone. My husband told the manager he would buy the mistake pizza (it sounded delicious to him) so it wouldn't go to waste. The manager gave him a super dirty look and said \"why would you do that?\"...okay never mind..."}
{"text":"Oreganos is our go to restaurant when we went plentiful healthy delicious options.  When we have visitors, we bring them here.  Typically, we split the entrees because they are generous.   Today, we ordered our own selections.  My vino bambino salad was spectacular.  My son had meatballs and angel hair that tastes just like his Italian Grandmother use to make. Our waitress Bri was sweet and very knowledgeable about Oreganos entire menu.  She is a great asset.  See you soon with our next visitors."}
{"text":"Oreganos is always spot on! Amazing Service, food, and atmosphere! Definitely one of our favorites spots to go for dinner! We always split a Kick-Ass garlic bread, a plate of Big Rig pasta, and a white chocolate macadamia pizza cookie! Some of the best stuff at Oreganos!  We bring all our friends/family that visit from out of state here and they never let us down! We love you Oreganos!"}
{"text":"I have been to a bunch of Oregano's around the city and i've never had much else to say besides that its an A-OK Italian Chain restaurant- emphasis on the Chain. 

For what it is, I've always felt their menu options and flavors are pretty decent, nothing memorable in either direction. The good thing above this place is that it is structured to deal with larger parties and has a big patio which is great in Arizona about 9 months out of the year. This particular neighborhood really needs more food options so placing an Oregano's here was definitely a smart idea.

If Oregano's is reading (and I would encourage any dedicated manager to do so), I think there's a couple of rather simple improvements that they could implement right away. When it comes to the lunch hour rush, we have TONS of businesses nearby with employees that only have 40-50mins for a meal, so timing is key here. When my team and I went there a couple of days ago, it took a while to even get our orders in, and be able to pay. The food time wasn't long, it was getting the server to come over that posed difficulty. In terms of the menu, their list of food items is HUGE but their lunch specials are only 4 items that never rotate/change. I appreciate that their salads have a JR size available as it makes it cheaper and more accessible for lunch, but this would be great to see in the pasta or sandwich department too.

This time I ventured outside the salad world and ordered the only soup in their menu, the Italian Wedding Soup. At around $6 ($1.50 refills), it is a big plate of soup with a decent amount of baby meatballs and pasta. I would have loved to see more spinach there as it is only a 3 ingredient soup (meatball, pasta, spinach) and the vast majority of it was broth. The cheesy bread along side tasted alright but it was a little cold (i.e. not fresh).

My friend liked the spice level on his diablo pasta but the thin pizzas definitely looked carboard-y. Prices are a definitely on the upper limit for a chain restaurant that is all over the valley, but they seem to be justifying it with their over-sized portions."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has always been great. The meatballs are amazing. All the salads are great as well as pastas and pizzas. I would come during lunch or early dinner hours because the wait can easily be over a hour."}
{"text":"Food and service are pretty good, but make sure you have plenty of time, as the place is always packed and there is a wait. Apps are pretty good (love the calamari) and salads are awesome. I am not a fan of the 45min wait for a deep-dish pizza, but the thin crust I had was pretty solid and I'm not a thin crust person. All in all, the food is good, but this place is too much of a time commitment, so I probably won't go very often. I've tried it 2x and been there over 1.5 hrs both times."}
{"text":"Great place!! Best thin crust  pizza ever!! Great service! This is the real deal for pizza lovers. Every time I'm in Scottsdale I make it a point to have thin crust pizza at Oregano's. I'm a pizza lover and haven't found this quality pizza anywhere else....in addition, their salads are excellent...."}
{"text":"All oreganos rock! In my opinion best pizza in AZ. Their pizza cookie desert is awesome as well. This location never fails to impress me, I meet clients here regularly. Weekday lunch almost always has a wait if you do not want to sit at the bar though."}
{"text":"I was able to reserve my spot in line on yelp which was amazing! We only had to wait extra time when we got there because we requested to sit outside.  Once seated, service was fast and incredibly friendly.  Portions are huge and and flavors are divine.  The salad that came with our sandwich could have easily fed a family of four and our sandwich was completely loaded with meat; they definitely don't skimp.  $2.99 for a giant slice of cheese pizza and a larger sized kids drink was a great deal from the kids menu.  I would highly suggest the garlic bread appetizer and a mouth watering pan cookie for dessert."}
{"text":"On Labor Day a few girlfriends and I went to Oreganos for lunch.  I ordered fried zucchini and a fettuccine dish.  Waitress was friendly and attentive.  Food was served hot and accurately.  She kept the refills coming.  Positive experience, will be back."}
{"text":"The Pablo Picasso Salad is huge and delicious.  We shared the big size with our meal!  It was plenty big for two as a meal.
Our waitress, Sam M., was so friendly and helpful. She stopped by many times to check if we needed anything else. We asked about the Margaritas and she brought us a sample of the Anita Margarita, it was delicious so we has a pair of them ."}
{"text":"I took my daughter to dinner for her birthday and really enjoyed the food, service, location, and patio.  The server was friendly, knowledgeable, and served our food hot, just like I like it.  We ordered a pizza that was delish and their fried zucchini strips are tasty!"}
{"text":"The first time I went we had pizza and salad which was really good. Yesterday I had the chicken parm sandwich and it was amazing. This is a place I'd recommend not only for the food but for their wait staff. I've always been treated very nicely and they seem to be genuinely happy. Our server the other day would've made the manager and owner proud to have him as an employee."}
{"text":"The wait times here really are bad. Be prepared to wait for over 30 minutes for a table, at least. The staff are constantly running around like they have no clue what they are doing and are to busy playing and gossiping with the other staff. When you finally get to order it takes them forever to bring your food, and be prepared to eat in shifts. This visit had our party of 5 eating dish by dish, so if you enjoy eating together definitely don't come here. We had to stop someone and ask for refills of ice tea and when they came the empty glasses just sat on our table. No one came by to check on how things were or to clean up the done dishes.  The food was really not worth the money or the other drama we had to deal with to eat here. Be expecting to slip and slide on their dirty greesy floor if you decide you need to use the restroom.  So... would I come back here, especially this location.  Nope. Is it worth the money. Nope."}
{"text":"I was invited out w/ friends while in Cave Creek. I saw the 3 stars, but let them convince me to go... They said it was great. 
The food was good. 
The service is terrible. Took over 10 minutes before someone came to take our drink order. Another 35 minutes for our food to come out, and then we waited another 20 minutes after we finished eating to get our bill.
I won't be back. Take the rating as your warning sign."}
{"text":"There is little to say about this place other than it is just not good. We ordered a variety of items and not one of them was good. We, as usual, did carry out and were unimpressed by this experience as well. Ended up waiting much longer than the quoted time (which was already super long - 45 min, no joke). The parking lot was packed to the brim and I'm not quite sure why - I think I will just head to Olive Garden next time."}
{"text":"Amazing and spectacular are two words I wouldn't really use to describe Oregano's; however, they are a decent choice for those of you that like huge portions at an A-OK price. You can get in and out for lunch or dinner for somewhere between $9 - $12 a person and you can generally stretch this into two meals. (closer to $5 a meal)

The food is not bad, but in a city that has so much quality food to choose from, why settle for \" mehh :/ \" if you don't have to?

Service can be hit or miss, and on the few occasions I've been here was a long wait. Expect about 20 - 30+ min before your seated during the lunch hours. If you're here by yourself, you can slide up to the bar usually to get in and out quicker. If you're purely looking for the most quantity for your $, you've found a gem. I would try to find somewhere else if you are looking for a closer to authentic Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been here probably 6 times! It's the only pizza place I want to go to in Arizona. I just love their thin crust. I'd recommend going half-and-half on the toppings. 

Service is always great: fast and easy-going. Try to check-in on Yelp to avoid a wait. Even Monday night can get pretty busy. They take care of you while you're waiting with small samples but why wait when you don't have to? 

Everyone recommends their salads but, honestly, the pizza is so great I always stick to that while I'm there! If you want the free cookie-pizza that you get when signing up for their emails, you should sign up a few days ahead as it takes a while to get the coupon."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pie, it takes a little more time but you have to try it. Salads are massive and delicious. I usually order the Caesar salad on steroids, (I forget what the salad is called) a small pie ( Margarita ) and end up taking half the pizza home. It was noisy because it's a family joint and screaming kids come along with that. About a 25 min wait for a group of 3 at 6pm. Lots of parking. Clean bathrooms and great service."}
{"text":"Between a 3 and a 4, I've been going since the opened the original in old-town and their quality has been consistently good.  Of the three varieties of pizza, none make it to the top tier just a bit above average, if I had to choose it would be the weekly lunch special which is a large slice of thin crust  with a choice of toppings (charge per).  Cesar salad is simple but solid as is the bowl of pasta, great marinara sauce and all you can eat.  It's been a while but several of the house pasta dishes are worth a try too."}
{"text":"This place is good for pizza or pricey salads. The salads are really tasty though. Just don't order the stuffed pizza they are all cheese and very heavy and gross."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find out that this was a chain restaurant.  Went here for dinner with a friend and both of our entrees were very good.  Service was good and the food and wine were reasonably priced.  Will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. Hands down! We had cheesy garlic bread w/ marinara sauce and meatballs for an appetizer (there were 4 diners) and a big salad (which easily serves 3-4! The ranch dressing was homemade and wonderful. Then we shared a 16\" thin crust pizza (pepperoni and sausage). We thought we'd have leftovers! Haha! No way - we devoured it!! We are here for vacation and had never eaten at an oreganos. We want to go again before we leave for home on Tuesday!! Our waiter (can't recall his name) was awesome and his recommendations were spot on!"}
{"text":"Went back a couple days ago. (The last 3 times I gotta say they were 5 star occasions too bad I forgot to update my review to reflect so) To our surprise they HAVE CHANGED THEIR MENU. I doubt Oreganos is suffering financially but it looks like the changes on their menu is to try to get an extra 20 cents off every dollar. We also noticed their quality went down(could of been a one off situation) but as you can see from my pictures their wings were horrible, the one thing I come for was horrible :-( the sauce was the same but the wings themselves seemed to be attacked by a pack of dogs or exposed to radiation because they looked  deformed and tiny. I would of not complained to the waitress but each wing is $1.00 now so you gotta get what you paid for. They ended up replacing 3 of the(I had eaten some as I was hungry) ones the manager saw but by the time they came back out we were done eating. Manager said quality had not eaten but as you can see my picture it tells otherwise.

The pizza.(Chicago pan not deep dish) had a real weird texture and seem uncooked. At that time we were done complaining so we just ate it. By the way they only have their signatures for the thin crust on the menu but if you remember your favorite from deep dish or pan they will make it for you. Seems like they are trying to promote build your own and pay for each topping individually.

I feel like Oreganos is trying to aim towards gourmet modern restaurant. Which kind of takes away from what Oreganos is. 

Next time we crave Oreganos we are driving to camelback location hopefully they are still the same."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza and Italian food in Phoenix area. Everything we've tried so far is top notch. Service is great and atmosphere is fun. This visit we had eight (two of which were children) and our server Brianna took care of us. Some places don't check on you often when children are in the party but Brianna was great.   Can't say enough good things about the pizza but the thin crust is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you're ever in the Phoenix area you have to visit Oreganos"}
{"text":"We had take out from here to the other night we ordered over the phone and went right in and picked it up it was ready right when they said it was the food is extremely good here the restaurant look really clean they helped us get our food the car they were extremely helpful I would recommend going here to anybody it's one of the best restaurants out in Surprise"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service great food! Went in there on Friday night our server was Abrian he was super funny and provided awesome service! If your in the neighborhood you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"holy shit i love this place.

I have been a regular here for years. Eating at oregano's after a long work/school week is really something to look forward to.

The food is great. Its reasonably priced, the portions are huge, and the drinks are tall. don't expect anything CRAZY culinary creations here, its just not part of the restaurant's culture. The food is simple and everything is tasty. 

I usually go with the Sausage Sandwich, or one of the pasta dishes with whole grain pasta, and one of their giant meat balls. Its always filling, 
always good.

Sure the wait is long, but they always have free pizza, drinks, and deserts while you are waiting. 

Service is always great. Friendly, prompt, and they don't bother you when you don't need them. All of the servers are always willing to play along with my friends and our inappropriate conversations, challenges, etc."}
{"text":"First time at Oregano's. Arrived at 12:30 on a Thursday afternoon at it was 1/2 full. Good sign. 

The service was pleasant, informed and efficient, including the hostess and the server. 

I ordered the Big Slice, with two meats. I added an iced tea for $8.27. A good lunch deal!

My lunch arrived in 14 mins. 

The pizza was a pre-made thin crust 2 slices of cheese pizza, with the meats added later. As I picked up a piece, the meats fell off and scattered across the table. I had to eat it NY style (folded), much to my chagrin. It had ample toppings, even after I lost a lot of them but what a mess. 

The pizza had good sauce, extra heavy with oregano (go figure). 

Not sure the pizza lunch special was executed properly. Clearly I ordered the wrong lunch for me. Perhaps something else off the menu next time."}
{"text":"4 stars is the perfect rating for this place. Good service and always a good option. We have never been blown away but we are rarely disappointed by eating here"}
{"text":"We came on a weekday, and it was very busy. We sat at the bar and ordered a pepperoni pizza and lasagna. It was a huge disappointment. Their pizza tasted like it was from the box, and the pasta wasn't anything great. The only thing that wasn't a disappointment were the prices. They're affordable and cheaper than the other pizza/pasta places around the area. I've had the El Diablo shrimp pasta and it wasn't anything special either. The two stars are for the mediocre service. The restaurant itself is charming, and shows a lot of history."}
{"text":"Oregano's has a major following - basically they give one a lot of good food for a moderate price.  Small wonder that families flock to the place.  We had a pizza - next time I'll stay with a salad."}
{"text":"Service was great but food was disappointing. Ordered 2 chicken parm sandwiches to go and the chicken tasted like rubber. Whomever made the cutlet cut it against the grain and it was placed sideways to cause it to be chewy. Would have been ok if not for that."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night - quite a long wait but the host's estimate was accurate so I can't complain. Our server Dustin was solid - kept the drinks filled and got the details of the order correct. Really enjoy the food - love the GuacoTony app, the Pablo Picasso salad, and the Alfredo the Dark. Check this place out !"}
{"text":"Definitely go at an off-peak time to Oregano's (any location). My family never gets the thin crust pizza. It's not worth it. Go with anything else on the menu. The stuffed pizzas are delish as well as the pastas, salads, and sandwiches. 

I've been to six of the eight locations, and one thing puzzles me... why so small? They rebuilt a building for the Mesa location, but it's still a tiny restaurant! The Gilbert location luckily has a huge patio, and doesn't seem to get as much traffic as the other locations. The hour wait at Tempe or Old Town doesn't phase me in comparison to Pizzeria Bianco's standard 2.5 hour wait. But if you're getting a stuffed pizza, factor in that 45 minutes, it does add up.

The portions here are HUGE. Try the Sproccoli stuffed pizza and while you're waiting, get a basket of the Italian Fried Potatoes to munch on... seriously some of the best waffle fries ever! 

I love both the Meatball and Italian Sausage sandwiches. Served up with fries, you'll get two meals out of a full size sandwich. Definitely get the Italian Sausage with peppers and onions. 

The pastas are so yummy too! I love Alfredo the Dark and the Big Rig Pasta. Get 'em with chicken and you won't be sorry. 

Don't expect fabulous service here. It's standard college-age with both the host/hostess and the wait staff. 

Look elsewhere for thin-crust pizza though, the dough doesn't hold up well to the sauce. Somehow, I don't think they bake it enough.

Oregano's is great for a hearty meal at a decent price and it is kid-friendly (they bring out dough balls for the kids to play with and then they'll bake the creation up for them to nosh on!). Definitely check it out whenever you can!"}
{"text":"Ate the pizza and enjoyed the company of our server, Skyler. He helped us pick wings with parmesan lime and they were a hit! It's a typical pizza place but brings me back to Chicago when I'm there.

Its salads though are HUGE! And great! I'll get it every time I go."}
{"text":"Really great lunch menu. Portions were reasonable and even able to take some home. Our server (Kalee!) was nice, quick service, and made us feel comfortable. Packed up our to-go food and gave us bread and a to-go drink. Really good! Food was tasty. I got the Big Rig and it was tasty and not too spicy (I really like spice so try at your own risk). My partner got the Big Hot Parm sandwich and it was tasty as well. The only thing I want is for them to bring back the cream soda!"}
{"text":"Great Chicago-style pizza without braving the windy city."}
{"text":"Food = 3 stars
Service = 4 (but its crazy how the staff all looks under 18)
Experience = 3.75 stars

I stil have it 3 stars cause I don't mind eating in a dump as long as the food is good. The hot wings and greek salad was good, but the pizza (although awesome thin crust and lots of toppings) was WAY.TOO.SALTY. It ruined it for me.

The staff was super nice, but damn do they all look like jailbait. I was there with 10 women in their 30s who were eyeing our poor waiter-kid like man-candy.  Im sure he enjoyed it though. hahahaha."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic here just not so good eating there.  Call in, pick up, and take home and you will love this place"}
{"text":"I highly recommended this restaurant, really good pastas, pizzas, drinks. I love the people work here. They are always super friendly."}
{"text":"Pssst.  Don't let the other reviewers trick you into thinking that this place is famous for it's deep-dish pizza.  It's not.  (Well, maybe it is).  But there are few things I look forward to more than a nice slice of thin crust Oreganos.  

You can't miss their billboards or t-shirts around town.

If you're within 5 miles of Tempe, and you haven't checked this place out, go now.  

No.  Seriously.  Go.

And if it's not too hot, sit outside.  The ambiance can't be beat."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio on a chilly night and were toasty warm. Heaters and fireplace were great. Waiter was wonderful and the pizza was very good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious pan pizzas! Basically just a giant lump of cheese on some crust with a little sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and great food, especially the thin crust pizza. Don't add extra cheese though, it seems to take something away. The staff was very attentive And did a great job. I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time, Brianna our server was great. We loved our food and it was well worth the wait. The prices are nice and the kids meals disappeared quickly. We don't want to go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love the salads there! The air conditioning isn't very good though, and sitting outside isn't really an option in the summer. Best bet is to wait until the fall to go, or get take-out."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype about this place. I know I just about stand alone in this opinion. I believe last Saturday was the 3rd time I have tried this chain. Given... I have only ever had their regular crusted pizza,  Caesar Salad and Chocolate Chip Pazookies (cant go wrong with that one.) Pizza is not flavorful at all. From the toppings, cheese, and crust, its all just blaa... I will say the sauce is pertty good. But thank goodness for hot peppers and the Oregano they put on the table to cover it all up. If I am ever invited here for something, I will try the pasta next time and a few other things suggested to me by my fellow Yelp fam. But I will never come to an Oregano's by my own choice. I'm glad to see his business is doing well in Glendale. There is always a line out the door. I'm just saying its not for me. To many really good Italian places around."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza joint in Arizona!  Love everything on the menu, but highly recommend the Pablo Picasso Salad.  Also, save room for the pizza cookie for desert; our favorite - white chocolate macadamia.  The kids love coming here as well - they keep themselves entertained before the meal  with pizza dough sculpting competitions."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Grew up in Chicago and this place rivals the best pizza I've ever had. Had the thin crust SMO and it was supe. Great sausage, sliced onions. Super good. And the staff was so nice it's weird. I'm used to stand offish Midwesterners. Wife had the pasta it was good too but even she ate some of my pizza."}
{"text":"We love it here. Staff is friendly and food is good. The pesto pasta with sausage is very delicious. Portions are big so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! 

We've been here with friends and family and have always found the food delicious. Now, somewhat jokingly -- if the rest of you could just stop coming here on the nights we're there, that would be great -- because I hate waiting 25 minutes for a seat!!!  

The food is that good, and it's worth waiting for.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of chains but oreganos is pretty good! Priced right. Service was fantastic -thanks Delany! Pizza dough given to the kids. Save room for the chocolate chip cookie-ooey and gooey!!!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge, so you definitely get what you pay for. The portions are also delicious. My goal is to hit everything on this menu, because everything I have had thus far has been crazy good."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food is always amazing.  I will definitely be using the waitlist option on yelp every time we come here now,  there was a few parties waiting outside and when we got there, we were seated right away.  We Love You Oregano's!!! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Oregano's. When I moved to Arizona, I was skeptical of an Italian food chain.. and if I would be able to get low-carb options if I was on my keto diet. Oregano's had all that covered and more. Being Italian, I think I can be a bit more critical of Italian food but Oregano's NEVER fails to disappoint. From the juicy stuffed mushrooms, to roasted Brussels sprouts, to my favorite salad ever ( The Pablo Picasso), to the scampi in the dark , or Big Rig pasta... I have had nearly every dish and they are all amazing, authentic and both pleasing to the eye and stomach ;)

Plus, if you are in the mood for pizza, even legit Chicago deep dish- this place is for you too!  
Low carb? No fear, get a salad sans tortilla strips or croutons, or get a side of their yummy sausage with spinach..... they have something delicious for everyone!"}
{"text":"As a Chicagoan, I have pretty high expectations for pizza and Oregano's did not disappoint. It was perfectly thin and crispy and the sauce was absolutely delicious. It took quite a while for us to be seated despite the fact that we had put our name on the yelp waiting list per their intructions. Never the less, it was worth the wait, not to mention when the pizza came out it had the wrong type of jalapenos on it, so they gave us an extra pizza for free. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Scottsdale I always make it a point to stop here.  While Oregano's has expanded state-wide and some locations can be hit or miss with service (as any restaurant can), the food is always top notch and always brings me back.  Some of my personal favorites include Alfredo the Dark and the sausage pesto pizza.  The antipasto salad is incredible as well and all of the salads are huge portions.  Additionally, I've noticed over the years their prices have stayed consistent and not succumbed to price gouging like so many successful restaurants tend to do.  Oregano's will always be a place we visit when in Arizona as they are consistently excellent."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Arizona bar NONE!  I really would like a stuffed pepperoni pizza,  sandwiches and pasta are very good too,  lets not forget the salads!  Yummy you can build your salad the way you like it and you can afford to pay for it,  they don't charge through the nose. This is why there is always a line to get a table,  they give you samples of pizza while you wait and you can order drinks too, how great is that!"}
{"text":"So if you buy a bottle of wine here, their is no presentation.  Apparently all wine tastes the same to these people.  If your gonna sell wine, know how, don't tell me you don't know what the wine tastes like.  Buy the way, I work at a restaurant too."}
{"text":"Seriously! What is the deal with the wait at this place?!! I have been going to Oregano's for over ten years now (including the old town location) and like clockwork there is always at least a one hour wait.  It makes no difference if they add more patio room, expand into the building next door or even open up a brand new location 5 miles away at the PV Mall. There is always a agonizing wait! Of course - this isn't Oregano's fault. Unless they start taking reservations, raise prices, or botching the food I don't think there is anything they can do about how popular they are. 

As far as the food goes, the menu is a kind of bastardized Italian. Nothing appears to be authentic unless you count the pizza as authentic NY style thin crust. Everything else  on the menu seems to have been put there to appeal to anyone on this planet who has ever uttered the phrase \"Damn I'm starving\". Or to put it a better way - if you are incredibly hungry Oregano's is without a doubt a 5 star restaurant. If you are a food snob , or on a diet, or if you rarely ever work up a healthy appetite you will probably not like it here. I always seem to be hungry and occasionally enjoy a giant plate of comfort food which is why I give Oregano's 5 stars. 

Don't believe me?.... Try it for yourself. Fast all day until 6pm, then go to Oregano's, put your name on the list, sit there and watch the servers parade all that food past you for 90 minutes, then sit at your table and order a giant bowl of spaghetti and meatballs (bollo pasta). You should be in a sensational food coma by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic along with the Alfredo the Dark, pizza cookie, and Bellini drink.  I do not like the sandwhiches because the bread they use is soooo hard.  Last time I had to ask for a sharper knife to cut the bread and my server told me they don't have any sharp knives.  
The wait on weekend evenings is at minimum an hour usually.  At my last visit, we waited an hour for an inside table in the \"to go\" house.  Another couple walked in from the parking lot and asked the server if they could have the table next to us.  Server replied \"well, it's for people who are waiting, but go ahead and sit down I won't tell.\"  I was really disappointed to see that considering I waited my turn."}
{"text":"It's expected to have a long wait time at every Oreganos I've been to; however!!! My boyfriend and I came to the Goodyear location, sat at the bar, and spent 2 and half hours there with most of it waiting on another drink or food- not just dragging out a date. At first, I felt bad for the one bartender who was there, because we found out that she had some employees call out. Not once was there an apology for the long wait, even after trying to get her attention for 35 minutes (mind you, already started ordering at this point). She repeatedly went back to other diners, and without ever making eye contact with us. All in all, won't be going back to this location, keeping it downtown."}
{"text":"We were there for our rehearsal dinner prior to our wedding. I usually love Oregano's because it reminds me of home. I have never had a problem until that night. Our pizza came out soggy and half cooked. Then when I returned it (after trying to lift up a piece that was soggy after sitting in a puddle of juices and water) the manager immediately came over, which at first was nice. It was nice until he accused me that it was my fault the pizza was soggy and sitting in a puddle of juices and water because I ordered a veggie stuffed pizza. The man acted like he and the restaurant had no fault in it at all. I was just shocked. What horrible customer service! When he realized what he had done there was no apology for his behavior until over 30 minutes had gone by and my soon to be husband had spoken with him several times. By then I was in tears because my night (not to mention my dinner) had been ruined.
 I would avoid this location, if you can. I would go to the one off of Shea and Scottsdale Road or on Camelback or any other location. The only thing that gave this place one star was are wonderful and amazing waiter Mike. He was so helpful and so concerned that we had been treated so poorly. I love Oregano's but I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The Alfredo the dark with chicken was DELISH!!! The bread that comes with it had a funky flavor. My husband ordered the margarita pizza. It was tasty but very traditional (meaning very little cheese) so my husband was a bit disappointed. Environment and service was upbeat. We will try it again. (Looking forward to enjoying my leftovers for at least 2 if not 3 more meals) Yum!"}
{"text":"In town for work and was told that this was the ONE place I had to eat at while in Tempe. Although it's a Monday night, the place was packed and I found the one empty barstool to have a drink and place my to-go order. Saw a group of people order this frozen delicious looking drink, so I did the same. It ended up being the Gibbilini Bellini and it was tasty. I decided to order the El Diablo Shrimp Pasta and then proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait some more. I saw a to-go order come out and get sat on the counter, but was told mine would be a few more minutes. Fast forward to a few more minutes and guess what? That one was mine. 
Now for the pros and cons of the dish. The shrimp was huge and looked amazing, but ended up being overcooked and chewy. Overall, it was SPICY. The menu says it has a \"kick\". Yeah, that's putting it mildly. It's been ten minutes since I finished eating and my mouth still feels like it's on fire. I'm convinced they took jalapeño and rubbed it on every single piece of pasta before they gave it to me! Other than that, the garlic bread was buttery and toasted just the right amount. 
I'm inclined to try it again while I'm here, especially with the amount of people that were there. Next time when I read \"kick\", I'll stay away though!"}
{"text":"Best customer service experience at any pizza place hands down!

A girlfriend of mine and I ate there for lunch. Food was great and very reasonable prices. However we forgot our leftovers (I hate that!). As soon as I got back to the office I called them to see if they were still there. 

Unfortunately they had already been thrown out. So the guy who answered the phone, Drew, got the manager involved and promised to make a new pizza and a pazooki (substitute for the forgotten salad). I said I would be there in 10 minutes to pick it up. But they actually delivered it to me!!!!! 

How incredible is that! WWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWW!!!!! Totally made my day :-)"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with any Oregano's locations! All the food is amazing & service is great! The patio is the best place to sit!"}
{"text":"Awesome deep dish pizza! Great prices and staff is very accommodating and friendly! Definitely order the warm cookie dessert!"}
{"text":"The best pizza Ive ever had. The deep dish that is. The deep dish takes 40 to 45 minutes to cook. Totally worth the wait. Great atmosphere. Great service. Every dish I've eaten there was really good. Cant say enough good things about oregano's."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to an Oregano's in 10+ years, so decided to give it a try again for dinner this past weekend.  We got there early, so we wouldn't encounter a wait and were luckily seated right away.  I ordered a mango strawberry lemonade and absolutely loved it!  We shared a side of the meatballs and a Julius Caesar salad...honestly, I was already full after all of that!  I ordered the big rig pasta and my husband ordered the El Diablo shrimp pasta...the portions were huge, so I ended up taking home well over half of my entree.  Good place to stop in for reasonably priced food in a comfortable setting both indoors or outdoors with friendly service albeit a little bit slow."}
{"text":"Legalize Marinara! Haha .. my fiance and I LOVE Oregano's. The Pablo salad, the meatballs, the sausages, the scampi in the dark 9 shrimp scampi pasta) their deep dish pizzas, their regular chicken parmesan pasta.. all of it is HUGE portions and all of it is absolutely delicious. Fair prices, great service, delicious food, good cocktails .. you really can't get much better than that.

Keep in mind, this place can get pretty busy for dinner and on the weekends, but boy is it good! You will leave stuffed, and probably will need to get rolled to the car.

Also, the Chicago Deep Dish takes 45 minutes, so order in advance if you are looking to get it."}
{"text":"We have been to plenty oregano's before, but the parking is horrible for this one. Additionally we waited an hour in top of the hour wait when we got here. The two booths around us got their food before us and we still waited 20 mins more. Our food was just sitting on the heat tops waiting to be taken, but it took the waitress a long time to even notice. I get there are a lot of people, but ya'll dropped the ball on this one."}
{"text":"We beat the crowd by getting here before noon. Sharing the antipasto salad and one big heck of a slice of meatball pizza. Expect the salad to run circles around the ripoff we had last week at Grazianos. Shame on Grazianos for treating locals that way. Glad to be enjoying great salad here at Oreganos."}
{"text":"Just fantastic from start to finish. Our server, Alexandria M, was just the best. Everyone was friendly and had a smile. The pizza was top notch. Wife ordered gluten free pizza with a mix of pesto and red sauce and said it was delicious. I had the thin crust numero one-o. GREAT!  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten at Oreganos several times. The Italian sauces have an excellent flair and are very tasty. I prefer the marinara sauce. It is rich, red and spiced perfectly. The staff is always courteous and helpful. There are several locations throughout the greater Phoenix area, and we have eaten at three of them.  Our experience is the consistency of all three is very good. The pasta has a fresh home made taste. The breads our fresh and very tasty. They have an adequate selection of reasonably priced wines. Oreganos is far and away much better than any other chain Italian restaurant we have ever eaten at. They have an extensive menu with a great variety of choices. For everything you get, we also find it very reasonably priced. Adequate parking also. Make sure that you try this place if you enjoy Italian!!"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and was told that if I was going to eat Italian, it had to be from this place.  As I got off work one night I decided to place an order for pick-up.  (Glad I did!  The place was packed and the wait was long!)  
I ordered the Pesto Penne Bake, sounded good enough. I received my order and the first thing I could smell though the closed bag was the garlic! (thought maybe it was just the garlic bread-ha boy was I wrong!!!)  When I got back to the hotel I opened it up and the smell of garlic was even more overwhelming!  The pasta bowl looked good enough though.
This dish has so much garlic in it that it is not edible to the average person!  (I had to open the patio door to the room just to air out the garlic smell!)  
If you can get past the overpowering smell and taste of the garlic then it was a good dish.  But I must say the garlic is what ruined it for me.  Don't think I would go there again if I was in town."}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever we are in Scottsdale it is on our must stop list. The best thing about the place is the great staff. They are all young folks that are friendly and efficient. Whoever does the staff training should get a raise!

A great place to meet friends for pizza and beer. They just do it right!"}
{"text":"There is a great amount of effort that goes into eating at this particular Oregano's. First of all, arriving between the times of 430-6ish means you will be arriving near the time where there is limited parking space. I'm not sure how many people Oregano's seats, but it's 3x the amount of parking spots available. 

Secondly, the wait time can be killer. They do not accept reservations so you can easily wait up to 45 minutes during a non-weekend dinner rush. It's up to you to bring a powerbar or a TIME magazine, luckily I live 1 block away so I can come by, write my name down and go back home to watch LEBRON JAMES manhandle Paul Pierce. Or you can wait around and hope they bring you out pizza samples while you wait, which they commonly do.

I did take my dad to this restaurant for his birthday. When we were all seated...my mom changed her mind and decided she did not like her seat....\"uhhh, excuse me waitress, my mom really doesn't like this seat...can we please move?\" Even though it was busy and crowded, no hesitancy, we got moved immediately. Definitely some solid service points with the staff. Despite the wait, the customer service here is impeccable, makes the wait time extremely tolerable.

So we built our own Stuffed Crust 12 inch pizza with mushrooms, chicken and jalapenos....which takes 45 minutes to make. 45 MINUTES! So, yeah that sounds like a long time and it is. But good food is not fast food, do not forget this. While we waited we ordered the large Big Beefstroni Salad, which came anchored down with a mix of shaved rib-eye, jalapenos, white cheese, tomatoes, spinach, Romaine lettuce and crispy sauteed sweet onions on top. And it comes with some bomb dressing (not ranch). Definitely enough to feed 3-4 people. Once we finished that up, our pizza was knocking down our stomachs. This was a massively deep pizza with cheese and sauce and toppings for days. The menus says that it's big enough to feed 4-6 people. Sometimes when I read that, I think to myself that's a lie. But not this time my hungry friends. 4-6 people actually means 4-6 people. 

Oregano's, you have great dinners but you make me feel like a wood-legged pirate running a marathon...it takes me so long to finish with you, but alas your food is good and the amount of homeless people surrounding your establishment is amazingly 0....which is difficult to accomplish when you are so near to Mill Ave. So for this I thank you.

I do wish parking was better, I do wish that there was more variety on your menu and I do wish that your seating was more comfortable. I'm 6 ft 3 and when I sit in one of your booths, the table is nearly on level with my head. I feel like a child who needs a booster seat."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I literally come here at least once a week. Great food. Great atmosphere. Wait-times varies for the day of the week and time of day, so I'd suggest plan accordingly and don't get pissed off if you wait for a little bit. The food is worth the wait. #yourewelcome"}
{"text":"I like oreganos! The atmosphere is lively and friendly the food is amazing. I usually get bollo pasta and love it! This time I gave a try for ziti and honestly it was good but not that great if you like your pasta saucy! This pasta is more dry due to baking it in the oven. I would go back to pizzas and bollo pasta. If you haven't tried oreganos I would highly suggest you to give a try and make sure to get pizza cookie :)"}
{"text":"Got bollo pasta and I absolutely love it! They have changed their plates to a bowl and I guess the serving size has been changed too! Now you get more food! Maybe that's not true but it seems like it! I usually add chicken or meatball to my pasta and I love either! The best part is I can get a refill bowl to go for free! 
Oreganos has amazing food in general"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Awesome staff, very Friendly... Ryan. Lots of great choices in food. Yummmmm"}
{"text":"GREAT salads!  They come in quantities that you can share with one or two people.  Pizza is great tasting, but has quite a lot of cheese on top - I understand that's the style, but it's still a lot.  We also had the artichoke lasagna, which was really good.  A definite recommend and a great family place."}
{"text":"Okay so Tonight I was with a party of 3 and let's say we are going home with food. 

We got a 16inch thin crust Meaty pizza. (I forgot the name). Anywho the pizza was very tasty and the sauce is delicious! 
I got a side of Soup (of course!) it was great. 
The men:
Well I informed the waitress this was their first time. And she gave a bit of info on the portion sizes but nothing when it came to the salads. So-
Hubs got a Caesar salad.
Pops got a house salad.
One salad could feed 2 people. So we paid an extra ~$6 due to the size per person that are it. 

So in conclusion- the pizza is amazing! It's nothing without the sauce so the sauce was great! 
The serving size I would say are HUNGRY MAN status! 

I took 2 star due to the waitress not telling us about the salad size, and our dirty dishes were stacked on the table yet no one came to pick them up!"}
{"text":"Thin Crust Pizza is the Best. Italian Sausage w/ Green Bell Peppers. Fun, Friendly environment, an excellent spot to take family."}
{"text":"No management or visible manager at all.  Inexperienced children working take out a complete waste of time. Foods decent and it's a shame this is clearly a rudderless ship !"}
{"text":"After finishing my salad I found the serving spoon (we never used it) placed at the very bottom of our salad, was two spoons fused together by stuck on food.... Literally lost appetite and can't bring myself to go back."}
{"text":"Wow! this is the place for terrific Pizza! The thin crust is the bomb and I love all the ingredients. My wife likes the hot pasta with shrimp. So much food though you can split any dish easily. This is one of my favorite spots to eat in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I have had nothing but great experience here, when my Sister in law and niece came to Visit from Cali I brought to Oregano's and the next trip the whole family came from Cali and we ate here they all LOVED it.
Last night 09/09 my husband and I Celebrated our 21st Anniversary we ate at Oreganos we are Happy :)"}
{"text":"Yesterday afternoon me and my mother came in for lunch and we're absolutely blown away by our service. Sullivan at the bar was incredible. He immediately greeted us and asked us for our drink order as soon as we sat down. He was beyond helpful in assisting me with changing up my order from my usual dish. Our food came out so fast and what he recommended was AMAZING. After our meal he boxed our food for us and even gave me a tea to go. We will definitely be coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience. Yes the wait was an hour, but how can you get mad, when every single table is filled up. The customer service was great , everyone was friendly and helpful on my food choices. The food was delicious, you wouldn't expect such good from from a chain restaurant.Very recommendable. Both my friend and I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Oregano's your doing something wrong. They have the best everything. You can't go wrong with whatever you order. It may be a little pricey but you get what you pay for. You get a large quantity of amazing food. I recommend the big beef salad (not quite sure the name of it). Also you can't go wrong with pizza or a sandwich."}
{"text":"Best authentic pizza place around !   Food is always perfect and atmosphere amazing !"}
{"text":"I discovered Oregano's after moving to Phoenix and having a roommate that worked there. I have to say that I've lived in Europe half my life, had some of the best desserts known to man probably but the pizookie at Oregano's is easily in my top 3. It's one of those desserts that actually gets better and better as you eat it. The half baked cookie and ice cream blend together wonderfully for a culinary delight. I'd recommend just going there for dessert after eating somewhere else or after a movie for example. The only downside and I consider it a somewhat important factor is that the wait can usually be 30-45 minutes. Pizza portions are great though pizza here isn't among my favorites. Definitely recommended for anyone living in the Phoenix area and wants to dine outdoors or who is in the Old Town Scottsdale are if they don't mind waiting. Parking isn't too bad of a deal as you can generally park along some of the galleries just a street away from busy Scottsdale Rd."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my bf our food was good and the service was really fast too. We decided to come here for our anniversary. It was a thursday night and it seemed like they were busy but not super busy. We got seated quickly but it took forever to get our food. I think we waited about 45 minutes, it sucked because we had to cancelle our other plans becaus the food arrived late. The food was good like always and it was not cold which was my biggest worried that night. I just wished the service was a little bit faster."}
{"text":"Great local joint for Italian food with friends and family.  Expect to wait as this place will be packed.  This is great for big groups and tons of energy.  
You won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Catered to our party of 8 nicely. 

The back room is a little warm but it's not too bad. 

They currently have a server that looks like Johnny Bravo. Lol

They do have a gluten free menu! I'm all about the antipasto salad... FYI it's damn huge. Share it with like 3 people."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin with this place? Ive been in love since the first taste! long before I even moved to Arizona, my brother would always bring us here when we would come to visit and it was pretty much my favorite place to eat at. The pizza is just amazing... the wings are great and I love the julius ceasar salad with chicken. Staff is super nice and very helpful.  One saturday afternoon, a co-worker and I decided to have pizza and beer here one afternoon since she had never been, she accidently knocked over her cup which shattered on the floor(no, we werent drunk... yet). The staff waiter cleaned it up right away and brought her a new one. Great place."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night while visiting from California, Kyle was our server. 
The food was fantastic and Kyle was incredibly attentive and efficient. He was fast with recommendations as well. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful! 
The food was amazing!! The garlic cheese bread was mouthwatering! I had the Zany Ziti which comes in a bread bowl. The bread bowl is kind of pointless though because it's so hard it's practically inedible. Wasteful. But the meat sauce was soooo good!  My friend had the pesto penne pasta and that had great flavor. My other friends had pizza, didn't try it but they seemed to like it a lot. 
Next time we are driving through we definitely will be stopping by! Thanks :)"}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time in college but it had been awhile. THe main reason for not going for a long time were the long lines and wait times each time we tried to go. Now I see WHY the lines are long and WHY people wait in them:
  
1. the food is amazing. from sweet potato fries with divine aioli to the always alluring Vino Bambino salad to make it your way boll'o'pasta to pizza and pizzookie you cannot go wrong!
  2. the portions are huge and make the second meal as good as the first. I'm eating leftovers as I type!
  3. the employees. I think its against the rules to have a bad day here. Everyone is super nice and genuinely so. 
  4. the atmosphere. it's fun. It's different, it's cute and it works. Makes for a good time on a date, with the fam or just hanging out.
  
I have a new found love for Oregano's and will be waiting in line alot more often in the future."}
{"text":"Been twice now, once for dining there once for takeout. The wait is long, yes, but the food is good! Take out took 1 hour 40 minutes on a Friday night. Wait to be seated for dine in was 40 minutes. Thin crust pizza is the best, the pan is a little bready for me. Try the garlic lime parm wings! Dining in was a loooong night, seemed like they forgot to make our pizza or something :("}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here on Sunday during the final stretch of my first trip to Arizona. I was in heaven! Excellent pizza, we had the pesto tomato, and the peperoni, sausage and mushroom. We also had the vino bambino salad which may have been the best thing I have ever tasted! I didn't order or pick it up so I can't say much about the service, but it was definitely some of the better pizza I have had!"}
{"text":"Sampled their pizza, and soup. Great food, great prices, and exceptional service! Parking is difficult due to its limited and unique corner space. The restaurant has two separate indoor seating areas, and outdoor seating. Heaters are available for outdoor seating. Full bar available. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and customer service, food was okay. My family and I shared a stuffed deep dish pizza, my personal opinion, too much cheese. The pizza itself was decent but I guess after have deep dish in Chicago when I was new in the navy it's hard to find one that comes close. This one was an ok pizza I would recommend anyone to try this place out once and then decide for themselves."}
{"text":"The deep dish with sausge and pepperoni is to die for. In my opinion it is the best deep dish in the valley#highlyrecommended"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great food and atmosphere! If you love Caesar salads you must get the Julius Caesar! Love the deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"Definitely a family favorite! The pizza and wings are amazing and always great service!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is a good stand-by but I, having been to this and other locations many times, believe it is over-rated.  The food is a little better than your average place with large portions.  However, the place is crowded and loud and the wait for both seating and food/drink is often long.  This would be okay if the food was out of this world.  It's good, but not out of this world."}
{"text":"Dear servettes,

Please refrain from touching my arm when you greet me asking what beverage I'd like.  I'm married, and you just lowered your tip.

P.S.
Try coming by and asking how my food or beverage is once in a blue moon too.  It was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"We went to the one in Surprise. The food was amazing (and I am super picky about food quality!!) Great atmosphere and excellent service too. Furthermore, I was very impressed by our server Justin. He had another customer who was kind of difficult and who was making negative comments that were a little rude. The way Justin responded to all of his comments  and continued to dish out service that went above and beyond was very impressive!!"}

{"text":"I defiantly enjoy this place. They do have a wait when you order the pan pizza, but make sure you order it when you get your drinks. The golden chicken wings are to die for!!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible. Their pizza's take about 30 minutes to cook, but they are sooo worth it. Unfortunately, it wasn't that good as leftovers. Service was pretty slow, but I was with a group that was treating the table like it was a bar. As long as you're with a group that doesn't need 4 drinks each, you should be fine ;)"}
{"text":"They are not shy about the amount of food, deliciously well done, kid friendly. If you are in a chill mood for waiting for great food!! Then this is the place!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Oregano's....they have a fabulous menu, a great vibe and service seems to always be spot on.  Although parking can be a challenge at this location, if you get there before 11:30 and secure a seat on the patio, it is, overall, a very nice, relaxing dining experience.  

I ordered the Vino Bambino Jr. Salad ($6.99) which is \"romaine lettuce with corkscrew pasta, black olives, red bell peppers, pinto beans, scallions, parmesan cheese and fresh cilantro topped with wine-marinated chicken, sauteed onions, red bell peppers and sun-dried tomatoes.\"  I substituted fat-free Roasted Red Pepper Italian dressing for the caesar.  Overall, it was very light and delicious but filling. Although, I really wanted a big, greasy sandwich with sweet potato fries!    My friend had the Jr. Oregano's Favorite Salad (add chicken) which includes romaine lettuce, sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, spiced feta cheese, roasted red peppers, red onions, pine nuts and raisins, and she took half of it home.

I really want to come back and indulge in some heavier menu items  like the stuffed pizza, pizza cookie etc.  But, that will require that I commit to a serious workout either before or after!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza (BBQ CHICKEN) in town and desert pazooki"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my parents and their friends this past Sunday. Food was great as usual. The only problem was the speaker above our table. Made it hard to have a conversation. It took us and another table asking four times, before the manager even made the slightest adjustment."}
{"text":"We had another great visit at Oregano's!  Yes, there is usually a wait but we don't mind.  We put in our order for the deep dish pizza, grab a couple drinks, and enjoy ourselves.  

The service, specifically the servers, are top notch.  Every single one I've come in contact with is friendly and outgoing, and it really makes a positive impression on us.

Hope to be back soon for a pizzookie!!"}
{"text":"New location in east Mesa!  We went on a Friday night after a movie.  Place was packed and it was raining. Parking was tricky, but the  service couldn't have been faster or friendlier. Every single employee was gracious and attentive to customer needs.  Before we finished our beers at the bar, we were seated.
This new location meets the high standards of other Oregano's we've enjoyed in the Valley. Wings were hot, crispy and delicious. The antipasto salad was generous and very tasty. The Clark Street Meat pizza was outstanding!  Delicious combo of flavors on a pie we will order again.
Great experience."}
{"text":"OMG!!! I have never been to this Bistro and I was really missing out. This was the best service I have had in a long time. Sat on the patio and it was beautiful. This place is really tucked away but even though the parking isn't great when you get in there the patio music and black and white old tv/shows playing were delightful. I had 2 orders of the zucchini sticks because they where that good aswell the house made ranch dressing was great, not that horrible vinegar after taste you usually get. Wow! We were so full after that but had already ordered dinner. My 14 year old son got the stuffed pizza with REAL cheese from Wisconsin (funny because the take home box said exactly that it was real cheese and not the fake stuff, lmfao). I have never seen soooooo much oooey goooooey and REAL CHEESE on a pizza before. Figure a thin crust, red sauce then 2 inches of REAL mozzarella cheese, your topping and more cheese then red sauce (delicious). More cheese than I have ever seen on a pizza. One of the friendly staff said please let me help you with serving the first slice, because the cheese never stopped it was stretched 5 feet up and still a long stretch of cheese WOW WOW WOW!!!! I LOVED it sooo much and my son even more.  Okay so my boy is eating his main meal and me and mom got a diablo shrimp and a lady scampi shrimp. Wow  both were so tasty. A bit spicy on the scampi and even a heck of a lot more on the Diablo (this was very creamy like Alfredo sauce but kicking it up several notches). Biggest shrimps I have seen on a $15.99 menu. 6 large shrimp (half a pound at least) in your pasta with special sauce and an 8\" slice of French bread drenched in garlic, butter and parsley. Also they will bring you fresh shredded Parmesan cheese. So we have a full menu of spicy delicious Italian food, with plenty of cheese, oh and best pizza we have had in a very long time. I don't want it from anywhere else right now, btw I ate 2 shrimp and maybe an each on each side of this bread. This was the lady scampi. Please go and enjoy great food."}
{"text":"After waiting for over 30 minutes the appetizers came in and when the main dish came it was cold and had to send it back, they didn't heat up the dish but they brought a new one that was perfect. Thanks Alexis for your service but I will probably stick to the other locations where I had better experience."}
{"text":"First time at this Oregano's location.  Service was wonderful!  Our server asked how we wanted our food timed to arrive at the table.  

We had the calamari, anti pasta salad, a pizza and a warm cookie/ice cream desert (free on your birthday).  

The calamari was cooked nice and crisp and the marinara sauce is perfectly seasoned and one of our favorites.  

The salad is big enough to feed a party of four along with a pizza.  We love the flavors and the cheese-tons are a unique topping.  

Our pizza this visit was undercooked a bit.  The crust was soggy, likely from the fresh mushrooms so we won't be ordering those again.  

The free birthday cookie and ice cream (candle included) was a fun surprise.  It was very flavorful and a bit undercooked - but if you like eating raw cookie dough you're still good! 

Tip: use the Yelp app to check the wait times and put yourself on the wait list before you get there."}
{"text":"We've been to Oregano's a lot.  We've taken it to-go, but usually eat there.  Overall we really like this place.  It can get very crowded on the weekends so be wary of that, but otherwise, the food is great and we've always had good service.

Some of the highlights:

1. Their pizza is really good.  The BBQ chicken pizza is surprisingly good (and doesn't look like I would have expected it to).  We usually get their regular crust which is very thin, but we also tried the pan crust once and really liked it (almost didn't deviate because the thin is so good).

2. Their pastas are also excellent.  The Big Rig is really good (and has a kick to it), and every other one we've ordered were great too.  It took awhile to even branch away from pizza here but we're glad that we're now confident enough to mix it up.

3. Their lunch deal is impossible to beat...a slice of cheese for I think $2.95.  It's a modest amount for one person.  Toppings are extra, but unless you load it up, it's a great deal.

4. If you sign up for their emails, you'll get a free skillet cookie for your birthday.  They are amazing.

Needless to say, if you can make it in for lunch on your birthday, you will be very full for an almost criminally low bill.  Bottom line, this is a really good place for a dinner out.  Casual, fun, reasonably priced, and good food."}
{"text":"My daughter and I go in often just to have the pizza cookie dessert. Our last visit, Matt was our waiter, he was very nice and gave us the cookie on the house. He did not have to do that, it as very nice of him. It was an awesome surprise."}
{"text":"Food came fast and was super good. Lexy was our server and she was friendly and knowlegable about the menu. Great food and service. Will definitely come back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I usually avoid leaving negative reviews, but we have been here twice on our way to the airport and some things just need to be said.  We were in a time crunch (who isn't on their way to the airport?), but they wouldn't let us call our pizza in for dine in at 515 pm because it was NYE.   We stopped anyway only to wish we hadn't.  The pizza was horrible and overpriced for paper thin crust that tastes like paper.  The sauce on the cheese pizza tasted similar or worse than Chef Boyardee in a can.  Service was very SLOW and our waiter wasn't any better than the pizza tonight.  And to think we went there to cheer ourselves up after a tough day...bad, bad idea. We will not be back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"Being new to the area we heard good things about Oregano's and decided to try to try it out on a Friday night around oh 7??

Wow, was it PACKED with a good one hour wait. We were too hungry to wait that night but based on the smell, the atmosphere, ambiance and the line of all ages and styles we vowed to be back.

Turns out our first experience would be the dine in sort rather take out. When I called I knew what I wanted...the * Puerto Penasco Carne Street Pie *...  { Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow } does that give you A N Y idea how GOOD it was? I was actually worried about the 'pesto' when really it should be labeled magic sauce. 

The flavor was on point. I am a HUGE cilantro fan and there was the perfect amount on the whole pie plus the crust stayed the perfect crispness through transport!!! When does that even happen?!??

Last but not least, when I made my phone order, the person was spot ON with the wait time/ready time whatevs. I got there 10 mins early because I hate it when my food sits...whelp it was ready in exactly 40 minutes like she said.

Long story NOT short....E A T * H E R E !!!!

I will order take out again and I will definitely be having a dine in experience in the nearish future.

*cheers*"}

{"text":"After being sat and neglected for approximately 15 minutes, we left and were delighted by the friendly service, great food, and overall very cool concept that is Joe's Real BBQ just down the street. 

Thank you for making this review so easy. That is all."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is great. Four stars because  the waiters are better at serving & being friendly then the women. With that said I want to add when we have had a waitress she seemed to just be there for the job and didnt care to go above and beyond. Out of the waiters, Andrew is the best. We've been here many of times and he even recognized us as well as came over to ask how our meal was going even though  he wasnt our server. I definitely wont forget to request him next time."}
{"text":"Great pizza and I'm from the home of Pizza NY. Will definitely come back every time I'm in Arizona"}
{"text":"Yay!  They are here in Cave Creek!  Super busy, but worth the wait!  Great food as usual and friendly staff and great service!  So glad you are here!"}
{"text":"This place was good. The pizza was good but I was most happy with the service.  They were really great and we stayed past closingand they were nice about it.  I loved the pizookie you just can't go wrong with hot cookies and ice cream."}
{"text":"Wow. Having the mozzarella sticks with reduced balsamic...amazing! I would have taken a pic, but it was gone in two minutes. 
Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent! They even made a special order item for my friend and she LOVED IT!  All in all a great lunch."}
{"text":"I am absolutely flabbergasted that this bistro is rated so high. I pulled in and found that parking was extremely tight but was able to pull into a spot as another left. I saw many people were waiting for seats and was glad that I was doing a to go order. It was a mix of families as well as many college students as its only 100 yards or so from the university.

I walked in through the back door and navigated to the front of the restaurant where I sat at the bar and placed a to go order for a pepperoni Chicago style deep dish pizza, about $19 for a 10\". The gal informed me it would take about 45 to 50 minutes so that I could leave and come back or just hang out. 

Once I got back, parking was nearly impossible. I had to drive around for a good 15 minutes and parked about 1/4 mile away in another parking lot running in so I wouldnt get towed. Since this is a university area, all parking (even neighborhood), are private or blocked off. Once I went in the gal was just as nice and gave me my pizza which smelled pretty darn good.

Once I got back to my hotel I opened the box and saw the grease laced pizza calling out to me \"eat me, eat me!\". Oh shit, I was about to make love to this pizza, I thought. I love chicago style pizza and its rare to find a good one outside of Chicago (Tonys Little Italy in Placentia CA is an exception). I grabbed a slice by the base making sure to cradle the back as it began to sink a bit from the weight of this meaty monstrosity. I could feel the warmth as it got close to my lips and wrapped my mouth around it. William H effing Macy was that thing salty. I focused on what was in my mouth and felt some grease leaking out as I hesitantly swallowed it. 

Enough with the suggestive descriptions. But I was shocked! This thing was so damn salty I couldnt believe it! I took another bite and again, this was bad. I grabbed the utensils placing the slice down and did some science biting into the bread. The bread was soft but I dont care for bread too much so moved on. The cheese and sauce, a bit salty but not what I had tasted before. It was then that I took a bit of some pepperoni (which there is a lot of) and holy crap I had to close my eyes as it was nearly unbearable. I repeated the process finding the exact same thing. 

The pepperoni was overly salty. combined with the sauce and cheese made for combination that could stop hearts. I ended up throwing over half of it away and not even saving it as I had expected too as it was probably the WORST Chicago style deep dish I have ever had. The only saving grace was the service as that was excellent."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are huge fans of Oregano's, go at least twice a month, and have been to every one in the Valley and the one in Flagstaff.  Clearly, it's my favorite!  

First off, the service has always been extremely friendly and welcoming.  The North Scottsdale location has great customer service.  On one visit after waiting 45 minutes for a deep dish we were told it was wrong, and we were given the half that was correct, a new pizza, a drink for each of us, and the offer of dessert.   A second time, again after waiting 45 minutes, our pizza was dropped and we got a drink and our pizza for free.  

We are in love with the thin crust, deep dish, and cheesy bread.  Can't say much for any thing else on the menu - we don't order it!  Definitely get a bellini if you're up for a drink - yummy!!  And a pizookie!!

Yes, the wait is around 45 minutes every day of the week, but most of the time they will let you put in a deep dish pizza order while you are waiting.   Love it!"}
{"text":"we were going to ashley's furniture a bit up the street to buy some furniture (obv lol) and passed by the oregano's on the way there.. well after we finished shopping it was dinner time and we thought, why not? it's a pretty tight space/crowded and sorta loud cuz everyone is so cramped together so it would've been nice if tables were a bit more spread out... there were tv's but they were on black and white programming lol which was new for me... the waitress was really nice but every time we needed her for something, she was nowhere to be found, bad timing all around. 

the food was pretty good IMO. i got the bollo pasta w/ meatballs (extra charge). i'm pretty picky abt meatballs taste/texture but was glad they tasted good and weren't deplorable like other meatballs i've had the misfortune of eating. the portion sizes were decent and i barely finished my meal, but felt too full to get the cookie dessert i really wanted so idk i guess i gotta wait til next time if i'm ever near one again. idk if that was the only dessert option? but if it is, i hope they expand and give more options one day in the future! desserts r the best part of eating at restaurants IMO lol.."}
{"text":"Thanks for my friend and ex-Phoenician, Leeanna, for recommending the salad here.  I was headed to some other place that I'd found on Yelp, but was having trouble finding it, when there was Oregano's!  Having had In-N-Out burger for lunch and wanting something light, I remembered Leeanna's statement that she never even tried the pizza here since the salad was that amazing.  So I pulled in to the packed parking lot, past the crowd of folks waiting for a table, and headed for the take out counter.  I opted for the Junior versions of the signature salad and the veggie wedgie.   I sat by the door, since even the bar was full, but didn't wait more than 10 minutes.

The salad was yummy and HUGE, even though I only got the Jr.  I don't particularly care for raisins, so I guess I should have asked to get one without, but it was still delicious.  As with the salad, the veggie wedgie Jr was still HUGE.  I hadn't realized when I ordered it that it came with waffle fries.  Everything had gotten a little spongy and soggy in transport, but that's my fault.  The flavor was still delicious - great combination of eggplant, spinach, tomato, cheese.

I'll definitely come back for more next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time at the new location on Bell Road, however we have been to other Oregano's.  This location is TINY, like maybe 25 total tables inside. We came on a Thursday night around 7:30 and were told it was an hour wait. The hostess brought around pizza and breadsticks to those waiting to sample and offered to bring us drinks. Eventually we made it to a crowded booth whose benches were both dirty and wet. We ordered wings, a giant pizza, drinks and dessert. The problems: wings were the right style but the wrong size and the pizza was a completely wrong pizza which we didn't realize until everyone had a piece on the plate and the waitress had disappeared. We were too hungry at this point to wait another 30 minutes for the right pizza. Eventually we told the waitress about the problem and she offered to buy us a cookie. It's only been a couple of weeks since they opened so I am sure they will work it out. 

What would have made the experience better:

A floor manager to visit each table - this really would help in these first couple of months.

When there is a major order error like ours - send over the manager - We all felt guilty about taking a cookie from our 17 year old waitress... kinda felt like stealing her lunch money (we tipped well). 

Definitely go and try the food, it really is delicious, just don't expect a flawless experience for another few months."}
{"text":"$40 for a medium pizza and wings is fine with me if that quality matches the price point. If you see my uploaded picture, an employee dropped the box and still gave us our pizza. It was a sloppy mess that looked like 1/2 a pizza because of the damage from one of the employees dropping it. I assure you that I did not drop it. My GF, holds the pizza like it is a baby during transit. Now let's talk about the ten wings I ordered. First off, I received nine. Secondly, we only received one drum. I also paid for three extra ranches. They were all filled about 20%. I poured every ranch that I received into one ranch container and it still wasn't full. You should be ashamed you crooks."}
{"text":"We have been huge fans of Oreganos for many years. We even have our favorite server, Austin.  We met him at the Goodyear location and when Surprise opened we were sad b/c we wouldn't see him.  He then informed us he was going to Surprise. We try to go at least twice a month or more. The food is amazing and the service is great. Austin is attentive and is so great with the kids.  He is always so nice and on top of everything.  We have many options but we always end up at Oreganos and it's even better when he can serve us. Highly recommend them.  Yes there may be a long wait, but the wait is well worth it! Thank you to Austin!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit for us at lunchtime. They were NOT busy. (No line to get in Seated immediately). Took at least 15-20 mins for our order to be taken. Mostly sandwiches & salads ordered for 8. After waiting one hour we were told it was coming and they wanted to serve everything at one time. The sausage sandwich was not among the dishes. We were told,\"it will be right out\". We were all finished eating and the sandwich never came. The sandwich came as we paid the bill and we were told we could take it no charge because \"they were going to throw it away anyway\". We threw it away when we got home because nothing keeps in this heat and I wasn't ready to go home. Waste of time. Food is nothing special Service awful."}
{"text":"We dined here while we were in town for the Patriots Super Bowl.   It was a 40 min wait so I figured it would be worth it.  They have some good beers on draft which is a good way to start off.  The menu is huge, and we started with the garlic bread.  It's only around $4 and it's literally an entire loaf, and very good. 

We went with a medium Pan pizza, as we didn't want to wait 40 min for the Deep Dish.  The medium pan was tasty and very filling.  While it won't make you forget Chicago pizza, it's a worthy substitute.  They had a deep dish cookie dessert which looked great, but we were too full for that."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate pizza here this week while on vacation.  Nikko was our server and he's pretty solid.  Now for the pizza and the server who brought the pizza out.  The server brings our pizza, sets it on the metal thing and leaves.  Shouldn't they cut the pizza for the guests and serve the first piece vs here you go and see you later?  The pizza itself was totally runny with way too much sauce.  The dough was also undercooked.  The thin pizza (table next to us) looked amazing though!"}
{"text":"I've always found Oregano's pizza decent.  Between Tombstone and their thin crust, it would be a toss up that usually ended up with me preheating the oven.  A friend convinced me to try it again saying that their pasta is much better than their pizza.

I got Mama's Sausage and Peppers.  It was actually pretty good.  How do you mess that up, right?  It was a little confusing when two different people came by to ask if I wanted parmesan cheese on top, the top was already covered with parmesan cheese....

The notorious star of the meal however was the lasagna.  It was hands down the worst lasagna I've ever had.  There was maybe one layer of pasta, a layer of mozzarella on top and a little cheese in the middle, but the bulk of it was several layers of overworked ground meat(?).  It's almost like a huge nasty meatball with some sauce and cheese in different spots that you found in the back of the fridge.

I was going to give 3 stars until later on in the meal I tried a piece of meat that was hanging out in the middle of the plate that didn't have any cheese or sauce to hide behind.  That little morsel of meat lost this place another star."}
{"text":"Just walking into the restaurant made me nuts the aroma of garlic, pizza & other food permeated the air. So I tried their meatballs & Angel Hair pasta along with Sweet potato fries. 
WOW! Fantastic flavor for both. I hate to rave too much about the place because then it will be too crowded the next time I visit it. The prices are very good & plenty of parking."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant ever!! Like seriously.. Ever! I just wished ordering wings wasn't that restricted. What's so hard about being able to order 2 orders of 7 wings with different sauce instead of 14 of just one sauce... I find it more difficult baking a pizzokie with 2 flavors. I still love oreganos though :)"}
{"text":"Looooong wait. Told us 15 minutes and we left after waiting 45 minutes. Clean it up Oregano's."}
{"text":"Divine thin crust pizza, great salads, appetizers, wings, and pizza cookies (left a little doughy with ice cream on top). The service is always great as is the atmosphere. The wait can be a long on weekend nights but the food is worth it. Lunch specials are also good and it's a great place for a work lunch. Large patio area is a perfect place to eat most of the year. 

My go-to menu items are the Pablo Picasso salad, the Número One-O on thin crust, and a peanut butter pizza cookie."}

{"text":"One of my favs! 
I grew up in Scottsdale and Oregano's is always a place I have to hit when I'm home.  We had to wait for about 30 minutes but once we sat down and ordered our food came our really fast.
I brought my fiancé and his family here for dinner while they were in town visiting and they all loved it. (major brownie points for me) 
I order the same thing every time and it's consistently delicious! Pablo Picasso salad and pepperoni thin crust pizza.  My fiancé is from outside of Chicago, so next time we go we are going to try the deep dish. 

The only reason I gave it four stars is because if you want pick up, it's always over an hour wait which is never fun when you're hungry! I've ordered pick up a few times but I think it's best just to wait, grab a drink and dine in their cute, perfectly designed restaurant."}
{"text":"AMAZINGGGG!!!!! I discovered Oregano's while in college at ASU and I have since gotten every family member, boyfriend, friend, etc. addicted.  My favorites include: Vino Bambino, Cheesy Garlic Bread, Italian Gold wings (with a side of medium dipping sauce), Big Rig with meatballs, and a half chocolate chip half white chocolate Pizookie! It's safe to say you will be in a food coma after consuming all of this so beware. On top of delicious food and fun drinks (the sangria is a fave) the staff is always on top of it. Plus they have very clever sayings on their shirts! This is an absolute must for everyone!!"}
{"text":"So ... we came in craving a delicious Pizookie.  Mind you we had been talking about getting one for the last three hours!!  What a disappointment it was to be hosted by one of the most inattentive servers in my dining experience.  Couldn't tell you his name because he never introduced himself.  Took our drink and dessert order and came back only once to check on us.  We had to guess what the bill was and leave some cash on the table because he never came back to drop off the check.  In his defense, he was pretty busy with all of his other tables who were looked more promising of a bigger tab!  So, we enjoyed our Pizookie without any napkins (and with a toddler, this was a bit of challenge).  Just some thoughts about our experience tonight, think I will continue to get my Pizookie at Zipps Sports bar and grill where the skillet is bigger, and they actually notice customers sitting at the table."}
{"text":"The recipes have changed and not for the better. The so called Alfredo is anything, but Alfedo. It's a nice tasting butter sauce, but not Alfredo & not even Italian tasting.

The new wedding soup lacks pastini and spinach. It's over saturated with protein, and tastes like chicken soup with a huge amount of sausage fat added. 

The sausage and calamari were over cooked.

The service however was great. Overall, very disappointing."}
{"text":"My first time @ Oreganos, heard wonderful things about the food, so I thought we'd check it out... sitting at the bar we had a lovely waitress named Carrie, she was very accommodating and very knowledgeable... She gave us several great options for lunch, it was nice who knew the menu so well, I brought my father with me and he is almost impossible to keep happy and she did it...I was shocked! Thank you, Oreganos, will be back whenever were in town! =D"}
{"text":"The food was amazing as it is at every other Oreganos but the service was not the same. The service provided was beyond a disgrace. The hostess forgot about our waiting party, adding an extra 45 minutes to our wait- absolutely unacceptable for a party of three. We did not receive our appetizer until AFTER our meal was brought out. Service was slow and curt. While I would recommend any other Oregano's, this one was absolutely unacceptable. I would recommend either the Paradise Valley or Glendale locations but definitel not the Cave Creek location."}
{"text":"My family ate here while on vacation. We split a family size salad among four of us. I will note that my daughters are 3 and 7, but it was a huge salad. My wife and I ordered a thin crust pizza. We were planning to order a small numero uno (I think that is what it was called) Unfortunately, we took the servers suggestion and went up a size. It was way to much pizza. The other issue is that he convinced us to split the pizza into a half numero uno and a half Calvin (I think that is the name). What we got, was a full size Calvin. While the pizza was delicious, it was frustrating that we did not get what we ordered. Interesting enough the manager offered to make us another numero uno on top of the pizza we could not finish. We declined. There was no offer of even $5 off. A small deduction off the bill should have been offered. This odd customer service is the only thing keeping this review from 5 stars."}
{"text":"So I gave Oreganos another chance, and I'm glad I did.  It was a busy Saturday nite, we had about a 15 minute wait at the bar.  The service and food were outstanding!  This time we had the chicken pesto and and a salad, both were very tasty!

This was my 2nd time to the new location, and it seems like they worked out all the kinks,  we'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place. I used to hit it up almost every time I visited Phoenix, and strangely enough I only went once when I ended up living there a few years.

Food is good. Good menu selection and nice outdoor seating. Can get busy on weekends and afternoons---especially by the flood of ASU students coming through."}
{"text":"The Mid day Rush lunch specials are great with added salad. Portions  are smaller just right. Tried the Dark Alfredo with  spiral pasta and cream sauce with poblano pepper, tomatoes and garlic bread, so good!
 The meatballs are flavorful and juicy delicious too. Our server Lexie was great. Will be back"}
{"text":"I don't get what the hype and big deal are.  I do think the outdoor patio seating is quaint.  I love that they give pizza dough to the kids to play with and then bake the kids creation.  I found our salad to be just okay, the pizza to be just okay and the pazooki to be way over rated.  I would not order it again.  In fact I wouldn't even go back to the restaurant unless it was a night out that someone else planned."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout, the pan pizza only had the flavor of Oregano. I won't order the pizza again. The pasta was a tasty very large portion, the staff friendly and prices affordable."}
{"text":"Food was great, but the service was even better!! Shoutout to Ryan S. for being the best guy out there! Made us feel very welcome coming from California! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Last night was likely the last visit to this location. We ordered take out around 7 pm and i live about ten minutes away. They got off to a rough start when I ordered shrimp scampi the response was \"what kind of meat?\" I continued with the el diablo shrimp pasta and again was met with \"what kind of meat?\" Wow.. Just like last time we were quoted an hour and ten minutes before it would be ready.. Left the house around 8 and of course, upon arrival, the food wasn't ready. Our wings weren't done yet. so we waited, and waited..845 and it finally arrived and our polite server proceeded to pull the rest of our food out of the warmer. Sad that they had the pastas and bread under a heat lamp for 30 minutes while the wings were cooking?? Who is running this dog and pony show? Unfortunately this is a consistent experience and, sadly the food was, as expected, cool and mediocre by the time i got home. It was 915 and all that was enjoyable was the cold garlic bread. Yes the servers and hostesses are cute..+ one star. Im glad I had a gift card. Should have gone to \"Z's\"!"}
{"text":"Chicago style pan is worth the 45 min wait to make!  Save room for the pizza cookie!"}
{"text":"Took my family to this location last night and had the numero one pizza with the thin crust. Absolutely outstanding pizza.  Plenty of goodies on top and cheese too.  The hour long wait though was tough but afterall it is Oregano's, one hour is pretty normal.  We have been to several locations and the food is very consistent.  Good restaurant to take your family too.  Would give them a 5 star but afterall it is just pizza folks."}
{"text":"What grosses me out is the floor is slippery from So much grease or what ever is on it.
I always get the chicken wings and when i did this time ,,they were only 2 drumlets the rest were the small wing.. They were really Small .  Not use 
to that,,Not sure I will go back for a while"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on business but received a recommendation from a friend to eat at Oregano's before I left.  I don't typically like to eat a heavy meal in the middle of the week but figured I would take him up on the recommendation and try it out.  First, our service was excellent.  Our server was super friendly, informative, and sincerely conscientious.  The decor and ambiance is heavy but it fits the feeling of the eatery.  The food and drinks started out blah but ended well.  We first ordered cocktails and appetizers.  My \"vintage martini\" wasn't very good...something wasn't quite right.  I would also rate the calamari as less than average as well.  Everything else was superb.  The brussell sprouts were very good.  Now to the pizza.  We tried to order a 12 inch Chicago style pizza to share and our server strongly recommended that we reduce it to a 10\".  We followed his recommendation and were glad we did.  This pizza was just AMAZING.  I took down 2.5 pieces and thought I was going to bust.  We left 2 pieces on the pan when we left.  The worst part was we didn't have room for the cookie...which is the reason my friend told me to go Oregano's in the first place.  I guess I'll just have to go back..."}
{"text":"The wait times are Ridic. We came on a weeknight for dinner bc we've only tried on the weekends before and the wait times are too long. (Anything over an hour is too long IMO.) So even last night (a Thurs evening), we waited almost an hour. Usually I am good to wait as long as I have a glass of wine but with these temperatures (it's summer - so over 110 out), even a glass of wine can't cool me off in their bar bc IT'S OUTSIDE. What were they thinking with that plan??? 

The food is delicious though. We've had pizza there, wings, and I had the Caesar with chicken last night. The chicken is some of the best I've ever had on a Caesar anywhere. And I get around!

I had a salad last time I was there too and I specifically stated no peppers. None of that yucky marinated peppers / pimento business. Ugh. And there was A PILE of them on there when it arrived! (it was another salad. Not the Caesar.) The waitress never asked me if everything was ok but you'd think she would notice I hadn't taken two bites off my salad when she picked up the plates. I emailed corporate to complain and they sent me a $10 gift card. (It was a $12-14 salad but I was just glad they made any effort to fix the situation since it was totally ignored when I was there at the restaurant.) 

Four stars instead of 5 because the wait times are crazy no matter what day or time you go apparently. That is just poor planning. Same as putting the bar area outdoors. Dumb."}
{"text":"The Gilbert location in AZ. This particular location is a little hard to understand as a business. When you see people standing outside but there are various empty tables inside and outside, it makes you wonder how this place runs. When asked the manager why people are not being seated, we were advised that it's for larger parties. So if your hungry and a party of four or less skip this location and support the small local pizzerias."}
{"text":"I have been to Oregano's before. Never a disappointment. We had one of the best servers this time around. I believe her name was Tiffany. She was on the ball. She made our dinning experiences amazing."}
{"text":"Wish I could give ZERO stars. This place is horrible. We've been several times, hoping it will be better, but it never is. I'll summarize our experiences into one review. First, the bar has been out of product. I don't drink, but our friends do, and there were two different drinks the bartender couldn't make because they didn't have ingredients they usually have. Never said he was sorry. The Guacatony...there's something really wrong here. It always tastes acidic, like there's a preservative to stop it from turning brown. I don't know, but how do you mess up guacamole?? However, the thin \"pizza\" with the guac is good....We usually get thin crust pizzas. They are always burnt (crispy, ok, burnt, not ok). The toppings are dried out and the sides are black. That type of burnt. In addition, we show our server and the manager we barely got the toppings that came with our pizza. I even lifted up the cheese to show her how naked our burnt pizza was. The servers are apologetic, but when he/she sends over the manager, the customer service ends right there. She asks \"What can I do? Do you want another pizza?\" We say no, we don't want to wait another 30 minutes when our friends are finishing their meal. We showed her our burnt and toppingless pizza, and showed her we are only eating the middle pieces, and still got charged for the whole pizza. Our whole party told the manager we won't be back for a long time because this keeps happening. She just said, \"Sorry. Can I do anything?\", but didn't offer an appetizer or dessert, or anything for our next visit to bring us back. We said, \"Well, we shouldn't have to pay for the whole pizza since we couldn't eat most of it.\" She gives a big sigh along with, \"I guess I could refund you and re-charge you.\" OMG, forget it if you're going to be that put out making a simple customer service gesture. It was like, ok, you customers who just spent over $100--don't come back. Bye Felicia! What they need to do is take some initiative and make the effort to keep customers. It's over priced. Poor management. Food quality has gone waaayy down. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with the boyfriend. First time I've been here without having to wait. I'll admit the only reason i come to here is because of the service and that rosemary potato chicken pizza (I rarely support corporate, I'm too hipster lol) . My partner had the pasta which i was questionable on however it was great and spicy. Our server was so sweet and very helpful. She walked by with this cheese crisp guacamole plate for another table with I hated her for due to I wanted to order it too. Food does take some time but this place is a small establishment. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great staff and great food. Big lunch portions for the pasta and calzone. We told them we were in town for a vacation to relax for our baby moon- baby due in 2 months. They were so friendly and even gave us a free ice cream cookie dessert. We were able to get it half chocolate chip and half white chocolate macadamia. Will definitely be back- with the baby!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here with the family. Food is so good and plates are huge.  Besides the lengthy wait time on food,  I have no complaints.  Our waiter was awesome today as they are every day. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"There's always something for everyone here with a huge selection of pasta, pizza, and salads to choose from. Tonight we shared the thin crust mushroom and sausage pizza and The Bistro pizza. Both were good though I prefer their Número One-O.  As always the favorite part of our meal is the chocolate chip skillet cookie!  It is so decadent with the gooey chocolate and melting ice cream. Every time we order this item it doesn't last on our table more than a few minutes and is devoured   This always keeps us coming back and helps me overlook the next paragraph. 

We sat outside tonight and I wish their fans were not so high velocity. Also, depending on where you sit, the water from the misters runs across the beams and drips on you.  Server didn't bring any silver wear until I asked and side plates had sauce still on them which we had to ask for clean ones."}
{"text":"I love love love their deep dish pizza here. We were visiting our AZ family in 2014 and they introduced us to this place and honestly we fell in love with it ever since. So whenever we visit them we always make it a tradition. As you can tell this review is so long overdue but I am super excited because we will be back to AZ next week and I'm ready for another one Oregano. 

I've been to oregano multiple times now and I must say the only downfall for each visit is the wait time (but they serve delicious food so it's understandable). So during our first visit here was that we waited for at least 45 minutes to an hour but it wasn't so bad because there were servers walking around and was handing out free garlic bread samples (which tasted amazing). Pretty good advertisement if you were to ask me. The (-1 star) is from the second visit, our family waited for a table for nearly 2 hours and nobody even came to check up on us if we wanted anything. I honestly don't know what happened there. Maybe they were just really busy and they had no time to hand out free garlic bread but honestly it's not even that.. We had kids with us so a simple \"hey guys sorry for the wait.. Do you guys want anything to drink?\" Nothing like that until we got seated. But I'm not mad the food was amazing after all that wait.

Ohhhh also the first visit they had come to ask us if we wanted to order a deep dish pizza while we wait so that when we got seated it'll be ready for us to enjoy.. I think that was pretty awesome and smart thing to do. We will be back oregano! Sometime next week :) I'm soooo ready. Hahaha."}
{"text":"Food and customer service is always so good... Love this place... The ONLY downside is sometimes there can be a long wait... worth it tho...."}
{"text":"What a surprise to find this hidden gem just around the corner from my kid's place in Tempe!  After an evening event at ASU, we were in need for some serious food, and look what we found.

The environment wad friendly and open. Menu wad extensive and expansive (And I think the menu might make ones waist expansive as well!)!!!  The staff, hostess, waitress, and everyone else we encountered were friendly and professional.  Bright and clean room and the overall volume was not bad for a Friday night!

Our food arrived quickly and was every bit a good as we had expected!  

Be prepared to take food home. Do not worry if there is a wait!!! It is worth the wait, and they do an awesome job of trying to accommodate you even while waiting!!!  The pizza tastes were a great tease for the real thing!

I highly recommend this establishment for groups of any size... Be ready to eat dinner awesome food and have an excellent time!!!"}
{"text":"How did I miss \"The Beefstro\" salad?  I have been to Oregano's many times, and never thought to order the Beefstro salad.  What is wrong with me?  This salad rocks.  Top 2 or 3 salads I have ever had, anywhere!  Beefy, spicy and rich (none of those words are usually found attached to a salad), and it is amazing.  Just go get one."}
{"text":"Order for take out today.  SOOO GOOD, we got the stuffed pizza along with a salad.  When I called she was very pleasnant and polite.  I arived when they told me it would be ready but it was still about 5 more minutes, no biggie.
The young gilrs working the take out area were very pleansant and proffesional wich is refreshing when dealing with highschool kids. And they gave me a beverage on the house.
The pizza could not have been any better, dynamite! and the service was outstanding.  The only thing wrong was they forgot to slice my pizza,  ooopps, things happen"}
{"text":"I really like that we could get on the waiting list before we got to the restaurant.  I ordered the chick parm sandwich which was advertised as BIG it wasn't as big as I thought  but still couldn't eat it all.  Friends had the mushroom pasta and the Rasta pasta and both said very good.  The appetizer bruschetta was not very good.  Our service was excellent.  This place is supposed to always be busy  so plan on a wait."}
{"text":"Wife:  After a hard day's work at Tempe Paintball, we worked up quite an appetite for pizza.  There's no better place to fulfill our hunger than Oregano's!! Kids jumped with excitement at this decision.  Upon arrival, they immediately requested their ball of dough!  I regret not taking of pics of their lovely creations.  Though it was probably good since a couple were inappropriate for public display!  We ordered the large pepperoni pizza and of course we could not conclude our meal without their infamous pizookie (freshly baked giant chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream topping).  Great place to bring the family for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"The sandwich and salad we ordered was fine, however my sweet potato fries left much to be desired. Most of it was little pieces about an inch long and the few longer pieces were just plain limp and saggy. I would not recommend ordering their sweet potato fries. Also, when they ask you if you want chips, regular fries or sweet potato fries they do not tell you that the sweet potato fries are an extra $1.09. When we were asked how the salad was, we told them it was a little dry and needed more salad dressing and she brought a little paper cup with some more dressing. However, when we got the bill they charged us extra for the dressing. I thought that was uncalled for. What ever happened to making the customer happy with their order!"}
{"text":"Tried this location tonight. The service was slow and they messed up our order multiple times. I really like oreganos so this time around makes me very sad."}
{"text":"So delicious! Its always packed but its definitely worth it. Great service and great food. Try adding roasted garlic to your pizza, it gives it a nice kick."}
{"text":"THE best Italian food EVER!!!!!!!!! 

ordered ravioli for starters. it had a kick of jalapeno spice to it. but baked perfectly. since the lasagna and pizza are made to order it took about 30 mins to get the food but it is sooooo worth the wait. also had a peach Bellini and apparently they have a 2 drink limit on it due to the lack of alcohol taste but extremely potent 

I got the Italian Flag lasagna, and I barely put a dent in it. The portions are huge. It was stuffed with sausage, meatballs and spinach with mozzarella & ricotta cheeses . My coworker ordered a thin crust pizza and my other coworker ordered a diablo pasta dish which is on their secret menu and consists of .... i couldn't even tell u. but a lil kick of spice and fettuccine pasta. yummmy. 

they also sell the shirts that their waiter and waitresses wear. they've got pretty funny kick lines like \"nice dish\" or \"legalize marinara\" 

We didn't have room left for their pizza cookie.. but that's like having BJ's pazookie."}
{"text":"Great pizza and huge salads and big bowls of pasta ...it's a good thing that the food is delicious because the portions are large! There are some dishes that are spicier than traditional Italian, but the ingredients are clearly listed in the dish descriptions. No reservations and there is usually a waiting line, but Oregano's uses the youwait app so you can call in while you are driving to the restaurant. This restaurant has a lively atmosphere and has an upbeat feel. One of my favorites for its hustle and bustle!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my review is not regarding the food (which I think is outstanding). It regarding the total unprofessionalism and disorganization of the staff. I inquired about a to-go order this morning for the next day, lunch time. They requested I place the order the day before but did not say it was required. Later that day, I called to place my order to pick up the next day and I was told they couldn't accommodate my request because they had \"too many orders\" for that time and could not take my to-go order because it was \"too large\". I was never told during my inquiry phone call that there was a certain number of to-go slots and that I risked not being able to place a to-go order if I waited too long. The manager, Alicia, stated it \"didn't happen that often\" so their staff wasn't instructed to disclose that on the phone. Additionally, no one was able to tell me what designated a to-go order as \"large\" making it impossible to know in the future what is considered a large or a small order. I am disappointed with the complete lack of customer service and total disorganization of this establishment. If I were placing a catering order, I could understand. But not a to-go order because it was \"too large,\" which apparently is an undefinable term at this Oregano's location."}
{"text":"Sorry for the wrong post in Mesa Az. I went to this Oregano's in Gilbert  Az and it was really aweful. My husband ordered a Jr. Sandwich and it didn't even have any sauces of any kind on it. He asked for some mayonnaise and mustard and it took them 20 minutes to bring it out. Then I ordered a Penne Pesto dish and boy did I make a huge mistake. We spent over $50 and I will never go back there again when I visit Gilbert, Az. I live in California and was visiting some friends in Mesa and they took us there.  That was money spend that I was not satified with I gave them a 1 star because I cannot give them no stars at all.....If possible I would not of given them any stars at all......."}
{"text":"AWEFUL I ordered a pesto plate and it was really dry and my husband ordered a sandwich and when it came it out it was really dry. He had to aske for some mayonnaise and mustard and my bread was so dry that I could not even break it with the knife as I was hitting it...... We wanted to order a pizza and were told it would take 45 minutes for it. Well it took us 1 hr and 30 minutes for all of our party to get their orders anyway. When in Mesa I WILL  not go back to that Italian place."}
{"text":"Had a great time celebrating my bday at Oreganos. I actually worked at this location a few years ago before moving out of town. The staff is always friendly which starts at the top and despite the fact that its now corporately owned the place still feels independent. We had the deep dish Pan pizza which took about 45 minutes (which they tell you up front). Just like I remember (almost). I dont think the sauce tastes as good as it used to, but that doesnt mean its bad now. Overall, Oreganos will always be a go to joint for consistent food and service, but be prepared to wait.  
Oh, and a free Pizza Cookie for your BDay is a nice touch."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding restaurant!!!. We had the garlic bread with cheese. Portabella mushrooms. and the deep dish pizza. The service was great. The garlic bread was huge and delicious. The portabella mushrooms were maybe a tiny bit under cooked but had a wonderful flavor. The piece-de-resistance though was the PIZZA. It was simple wonderful. To much food for three people. We enjoyed the left overs the next day. We are only in Phoenix for a month but will visit here again before we leave. As a side note; If you are in a hurry eat elswhere. The wait was 30 min. and the deep dish pizza takes 45min. to cook. It was worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"If I had read the reviews before I went I would not have gone. Glad I didn't. We very much enjoyed our evening at Oregano's. The big caesar salad (their small) was abundant and we shared it. The pizza was really tasty, hot and plentiful. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive and the price was reasonable. We will visit again before we leave the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly.  I had my first taste of oreganos almost a year ago and tired the Alfredo the dark with chicken. I haven't tried anything else. This dish is my favorite and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"What can I say...they never do me wrong!  I try to frequent mostly local owned restaurants, but Oregano's just calls to me sometimes.  I love the unique salad selection and the fact that I get to choose small or large.  The pizza crust is the perfect thin-ness, the spices just right, I don't have to spend a fortune AND I get leftovers!  
Now the service...again, I have never had to wait for drink refills, hunt down my server for extra napkins, or send back a cold pizza.  I always get upbeat and personable service and as a server mysef, this really makes me happy.  
I don't remember every server's name I have had there, but definitely ask for Trish for great experience!"}
{"text":"I love this location!! Ordered some food to go tonight and the young ladies who helped me out were awesome, they were so polite and sweet.
The service is great every time we dine in or take out.
I love the Pablo salad, and also the chicken Parmesan. Their pizzas are delicious as well (of course.)This location will always be my go to. I am definitely willing to drive 25-30 minutes just to come here."}
{"text":"We lived in Chicago for over 60 years and I have to say, Oregano's at Superstition is the best since we left Chicago. Our server Crystal is a superstar.  I asked her about herself and she is a pre-med student...smart, quick and efficient. The place is well decorated, family oriented and the stuffed sausage pizza was AWESOME!  Manager, Sean, stopped by the table and he does a great job with his team.  Way better food and service than the other Chicago pizza places that have restaurants in Arizona!  Cannot wait for our next visit.  Very clean, plenty of parking, convenient location.  Try it, you won't want to try any other pizza place.  They also have an extensive menu of other items if you want to have something other than the BEST PIZZA in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, terrific wait staff. Tonight I had angel hair pasta and my husband had sausage and peppers.  We also split a tasty salad.  We are from Chicago and you couldn't ask for better Italian food. This our 2nd time coming here and this will be one of our favorite restaurants.  Great job serving Lindsay!"}
{"text":"I love this place never disappointed with services. My 3 yr old son odered a meal when it came he decided he wanted something else the waiter had no problem changing his order with no extra charge or griff"}
{"text":"It takes an instant to ruin an reputation. Indeed, that happened yesterday at this Oregano location. My son and I stopped-in  for lunch yesterday. I'd no sooner sat down when I heard the crowd of tables around us gasp aloud; My son was lying on the floor. 
His stool's metal leg had folded backwards as the weld just snapped after he was seated. The fall was so fast that it barely registered what'd happened. I picked him up and we started checking his body for injury. 
I was going to film the stool's 'mechanical failure' but somebody immediately removed the stool. 
Refocused on my son we went directly to the bathroom to check his body for injury. We came back and sat down. The gentlemen sitting next to us made the half-hearted comment \"free pizza for life\". 
Using an above-conversational voice and in front of the staff who were working behind the bar I replied, 'I'm surprised we haven't seen a manager yet.' Minutes later the manager arrived. He asked about my son and would later give us a business card and took my son's name, age, my name and contact number. 
While we aren't the kind of people looking for opportunities to take advantage of businesses, it still wasn't lost on me that the manager never offered to comp our meal, approximately $25. The manager offered nothing considering that the only reason my son ended-up laying on their floor was due to their equipment failure. He was and remains sore and more than just a lil embarrassed. We'll see how my son feels upon waking. But my perception of Oregano's has definitely change and with perfect reason. 
As some people wonder why sue happy individuals take advantage of a system; I'm reminded that people rarely ever do the right thing w/o being compelled...


*update 2-11-2017
The manager mentioned above did call today several hours after this original posting. 
He asked about our son and apologized stating, 'that he got busy having every intention of picking-up the meal'. We must now provide him an address to do so..."}
{"text":"1st time here, I love Italian food so I had low expectations. The Big Rig Pasta was amazing. Just a hint of spicy which I loved. The Huge Guaca Toni was a great appetizer. Not a lot of restaurants nail the taste of a good guacamole but they definitely did. They had great costumer service. Management made sure we were always taken care of. The best part of all, it was super affordable! Spend $35 on dinner for two. Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"We've been twice in the last month and both visits ended with the manager apologizing for cold food or forgotten order. This place used to be good."}
{"text":"Awesome is the only way to describe this place! The soup is served in a bread bowl and the salads are enormous, score! The garlic bread is on point! Don't forget the extra cheese! And the pizza.. wowww. Thanks oraganos!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service is almost always on-point as well. The place isn't nearly big enough to handle their popularity despite a big patio (the building was formerly a fast-food place), so expect long waits during peak times. Most recently tried the waitlist option here on Yelp but still ended up waiting nearly 15 minutes despite arriving right when we were supposed to. Regardless, the food is worth the wait and is consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Pablo Picasso is the best salad! I have not had one thing I did not like. We eat here regularly."}
{"text":"If there are some things that I deem over rated , this would be one. I don't get all the hype with Oreganos and I have dined at each one of their restaurants , the exception is Gilbert.. because, I just never go to that part of the valley. There is always a wait.. that's okay. But, to me, I would rather wait for honest , actual, good pizza. The last time I was here was at this location ... my pizza , The Numero One-O, came out after everyone else's in the group of us... and at the same time as the Antipasto Thing Salad... pet peeve of mine: ordering a starter or salad to share and it coming with the entree. They also put the load of dressing on the salad instead of on the side. My pizza was lackluster, as it is each and every time I am at Oreganos... and this is such a negative review.. you get the point and I will just end it now. Return factor: Not, unless my friends who insist make me. I'm a Pomo; Bianco or Cibo fan..& they aren't even down in this category of plain."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Yes, it's busy, but it is a new location and there's a shortage of great pizza places near by. So glad they moved in."}
{"text":"We love this location. The servers are always pleasant and knowledgeable. This place keeps expanding so they must be doing something right, right ? It within 30 seconds of the new Harkins theater making it perfect for a meal before the show. I was never a thin crust kind of guy that is until Oregano's. There thin crust pizza rocks and is addictive."}
{"text":"Extremely poor customer service with mediocre Italian food at high prices.

I would much rather find a small, local and authentic place to enjoy.

Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place rocks, best salads, pizza, meatballs are killer! Always friendly people ho work here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. The food is always delicious and the staff are always helpful. They can get pretty busy so I would suggest dining early however, the food is worth the wait.  Even the wings with no sauce are delicious who knew!  Their dishes have Italian with the kick written all over it. If you like new and different dishes this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Excellent food, clean, fast service, have been here several times. Today I must have caught them on a bad day. We never got the extra dressing requested and we also requested a cookie. The waiter never brought it or our ticket. We ended up going up to the counter and paid the ticket and we were give a coupon for a free cookie next time we visited which was nice! All around, their Chicken Caesar salad is the best I have ever had and I always order the extra side of chicken. They will give us as much parmesan cheese as we can eat as well!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is always great and the pizza is delicious!! Best pizza on this side of town!!"}
{"text":"Didn't even stay for food, they don't show the Arizona Cardinals game!!! Seriously???? They are your home team!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just had some of the worst service I have had in a long time. No one to take drink orders then no one to take our order. Ordered a half pepperoni half cheese it was all pepperoni so they made me some slices and it took so long to get to me the people at my table were ready to leave by the time I got my food. I asked our waiter for boxes after for leftovers, after about 5 minutes of watching him hang out at the bar I got them from the kitchen myself. The worst part was the store was not busy at all."}
{"text":"I would probably say the BEST pizza place ever!  Great food, definitely cooked to perfection, and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the food.  If you're going on a date, with the family, or friends, get the numero one-o pizza and a pizza cookie for dessert.  I have never had a bad experience at any Oreganos.  Also glad to hear they opened one up in Cave Creek too!"}
{"text":"Good pizza!! I'm from Chicago and it gives me a little taste of home. We love to get the pizzookie and cheesy garlic bread when we dine in. Always great attentive staff and they have pizza by the slice lunch deals!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my regular stops. The food is very good, the prices are fair and the atmosphere is excellent. I usually get a salad, the dinner salad with chicken is excellent and the Pablo Picasso salad is excellent as well.
Five stars."}
{"text":"Of course the food is amazing, the service is sometimes
Hit or miss. Tonight we sat at the bar and had AJ who was beyond fabulous. So attentive, high energy and just a really great server. We will be back to see him!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on Friday and ordered a dinner salad, pasta with marina and meatballs, and in the middle of the night I woke up with food poisoning."}
{"text":"Best thin crust grandma Gs rosemary chicken potatoe pizza... Amazing! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great staff, excellent food/portions. Always busy so recommend reserving a table on yelp!"}
{"text":"Joined a friend (who lives locally) and his family here for dinner last night. Can't imagine a better experience! Gorgeous patio, casual vibe, family-friendly, great service, and AMAZING food!

The antipasto salad was compact in size, but incredibly flavorful. The pizza (we had the pesto/sausage/gorgonzola on a whole wheat thin-crust) was fantastic. We had a total of four kids between us, and they each had a different pasta dish, all cooked perfectly. The warm cookie with vanilla ice cream for dessert was the perfect finish. Our little girl was asleep before we got her buckled into the car seat!

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What impressed me most about this place is the staff could teach a seminar on customer service. It wasn't that 1 server was great or they fixed something wrong, it was that every single person working there was nice, happy, eager to help, and on the ball. 
As for the food - it was exactly what you would expect from a top notch pizza bistro. Inventive and fun (\"OZONE\" as in create your \"own\" calzone). We had a pesto pizza, wongs wings (not on menu- you have to ask for them), stuffed mushrooms, italian sub, meatball sandwich and it was all great. They have two smaller seperate indoor dining areas and an outside patio/bar as well."}
{"text":"I'm impressed by the customer service at this location.  The staff is friendly and greets you when you come in. All of them are smiling.  Great atmosphere. l ordered a pizza to go and my order was more than I thought it would be because of the way they charge for toppings. They immediately discounted my order and apologized for the confusion. I will eat here more often because of my experience."}
{"text":"So while vacationing in Tempe, hunger hits all of a sudden and then my inner voice (stomach) says; Italian! Since I really have no idea where to go I Yelp eating joints the vicinity and Oregano's pops up. We pull up at dinner time and are expecting chaos or at least a really busy place but it wasn't, we were seated right away. Our waitress comes over right away and starts our drinks, I order a pint of beer which she hurriedly brings and it's ice cold and delicious. Because we've never been here we can't really decide what to order, it all sounds great. We wanted to try the wedding soup and our waitress brought us a sample and it was amazing. We finally decide on our dinner order and we try the Italian wedding soup, the Chicago Italian Sausage sandwich with sweet potato fries and the Big Rig Pasta with chicken, As we wait for our order we check out the place and it's amazing, there's a lot of décor all over the place which makes it cozy and interesting, there's old school tunes playing (Sinatra, Rat pack) making the place seem cool and relaxing. The noise level is relatively low considering how many people were in there and how much is going on around you."}
{"text":"Customer Service was amazing! Meatball sandwich was great. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"Worst oreganos I've ever been to. 

I've enjoyed oreganos over the years, the downtown location, the Scottsdale location. Was excited when they moved out to surprise. 

However my excitement soon turned for the worst within the last 2 months. My last experience I picked up gold wings. Let me start off by they were the worst wings I've ever experienced from this establishment (and I've had them quite a bit over the years). They felt microwaved and battered in sauce. I threw out over half of them in disgust. I was giving this place a \"last chance\" to redeem itself 

The experience before that I ordered my favorite over priced shrimp diablo pasta. The shrimp was cold. I was completely grossed out. I ended up throwing all the shrimp out and just ate $16 pasta basically (before tax). 

If you want a better experience go to Babo where it's half the price. Hell I'd recommend tailgaters that's not even known for their food over this place. Don't waste your time or your money and if you order anything at this place go with a salad. I'm sure they can get that right."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but I've tried to go to the one on Speedway twice this month only to find there isn't a single parking spot available. This is my first review ever and I hate talking bad about good food. The management just needs to figure out a better parking system."}
{"text":"If I'm ever in the mood for Italian food, Oreganos is the way to go. I went on a Friday night and it was busy. We had to wait 45 minutes for a table. That was the down side. But on the bright side, the customer service and the food quality was excellent! The server we had was really nice and he hooked us up with extra meat and extra sauce. I ordered the Alfredo After Dark. And that is by far my favorite. I'm not a big marinara person so with this kind of cheese is perfect for me. I also like how they come out in big portions. Which means a lot of left overs for me the next day. The customer service was great. I liked how the server puts the left overs in the take out boxes for you instead of just giving you the box and doing it yourself. He was very polite and asked us if we need anything like more water, lids for the sauce cups, extra cheese on the meal and etc. After our meal we ordered the pizza cookie. By far my favorite, however I feel like the cookie should be a little more firm not so much a dough texture. I like how this place is more casual too but it's really small inside. I would choose this place over Olive Garden any day!"}
{"text":"My Dad owned an upscale pizzeria in Oregon and this pizza is better than his-and his was amazing- (sorry, Dad!)!! We got the Chicago style stuffed crust pepperoni/black olive pizza and it was the best pizza I have EVER had.
Cool environment and decor, always seems to be busy, and we had great service. Will definitely be back to see try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Good pizza and great service. You may have to wait but it is worth it"}
{"text":"Just gotta say that this was the worst visit I've had here ,I Was currently a restaurant manager for over 3 years so the way my situation was handled I would of been fired once my corporate Manager read this \"Yelp\" experience anyway now on to what happened, the server she was an \" ok \" server as she did forget sugar we asked for and the fact that I Ordered a meatball Sub and the waffle fries and was enjoying every bite may I add untill I dipped my next fry witch was actually a chicken wing in ketchup and started to take a bite ruined my entire appetite and told the server who said \"that's never happened before\" and that was the end of that I HATE CHICKEN!!! and you know what's the thing that topped it all off??!! I  paid for it lol!! smh and to think I was fired for handling a complaint poorly lmao what happened here lmao Wow... Bigrob104@gmail.com"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had and I've had many New York, Chicago, California by far the best!!!  I highly recommend oreganos to anyone who tells me their visiting Arizona !!! considering I'm from California I only get it once a year when we're here for spring training!  A must !!!!"}
{"text":"What amazing service. I ordered 3 pizzas and 3 salads to be picked up the following day. I was instructed to make the order they the catering line. When I did this the salads were the catering size. I only wanted the personal size salads.  When I explained this to Gavin his response was no problem we can fix that. He was amazing. I will continue to recommend Oreganos"}
{"text":"We've been to this location multiple times for both lunch and dinner. The portions are large and everything we've ordered has been good. We've had pizza, salads, and my husband loves the meatball subs."}
{"text":"The food was good- I will definitely give them that. The service was nothing spectacular, but there was nothing wrong with it, either. The downside is that it is probably not the right location for them-- not in terms of geography, but this is WAY too small for such a popular restaurant. I am fine with waiting; I grew up in a family of 6 in a busy area, and we were always waiting an hour for tables. However, why buy such a small place for such a successful chain? Especially when it is the first in the west valley, but so well established in the valley as a whole? The waits are long, there was not the service prior to seating you can get at other locations (at least the 2 times I have been since opening). Will I still go? You bet! It's yummy, and it's worth it, but it's not going to nab 5 stars.
Now, if this was just a place to rate that giant cookie... that thing is 5 stars :-)"}
{"text":"By far Oreganos has the best pasta In town !!!!! The fried zucchini is amazing !!! The black alfredo pasta is amazing ... I mean I love spicy pastas so this was just what I was looking for !!!! I'll be coming back for more !"}
{"text":"Rumors were Oregano's was going to open in Cave Creek a year ago. I thought, \"There's no way.\" But I hope it was true. Well believe your eyes - they're open!

I have been there for the past 2 nights enjoying the Lawrence Pizza one night and the Wings of Gold the second over a nice tap beer.

The staff is very friendly, polite an accommodating. There were a couple of slight observations but I think they'll work out the kinks.

The management is really making efforts to make things right. The kitchen manager even came out and asked how everything was - wings of gold - stuck the landing - 10!"}
{"text":"Tasty.  Alfredo the dark is a personal favorite.

No reservations, and the wait can be long if you go after 5:30 p.m.."}
{"text":"Best CHAIN italian food in the neighborhood! The italian gold wings are deeeeelicious! I normally go for a salad or pasta for my meal! Cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"I went to Oreganos Scottsdale location and ordered spaghetti a while ago. I could not eat it. I found out why they are called Oreganos. There was so much in the sauce I had to send it back. I finally decided to give oreganos another chance. This time I went to the Cactus location in PV. I went with my boyfriend. We wanted a pan pizza. First, you have to order separate ingredients. You can't get one of the combo pizzas. Then we were told it would be 45 mins to an hour. Maybe they should offer complimentary basket of crust and marinara while you wait. We left. So I can't say anything about the pizza."}
{"text":"Retro Chicago Italian, Sausage Rigatoni, thin crust pizza, GREAT bruschetta ! Busy but worth the wait. Good service & huge portions. Authentic Chicago Italian. I am a fan,,"}
{"text":"My husband and I have oreganos probably 3x a month. Today we ordered from postmates. We ordered our regular Alfredo the dark with meatballs. The Meal comes with bread as well. The food arrived nearly 2 hours later, no fault of postmates, missing the meatballs, bread and the flavor. It tasted like cold noodles. No flavor at all. We eat here very regularly and have never had a complaint. Unfortunately after numerous issues tonight we will not be back. 

*******update I was contacted by someone named Mark who basically said sorry, we will try to be better, that's all.************************

Very helpful"}
{"text":"We've been here on a few occasions and haven't been thoroughly impressed. They are always packed and always on a wait- even midweek early in the evening. 

The first time we went we didn't want to wait an hour for our deep dish to cook, so we opted for thin crust. It was decent. Last night we ordered takeout and got the deep dish. We ordered at 4 PM and it wasn't ready until 5 PM. After digging in, we didn't know what the buzz was about. The crust was thick like a deep dish, and the toppings sparse like a thin crust. There was hardly any sauce. That's not what we know as a deep dish and I definitely can't see why it would take a hour to cook. We've had deep dish in Chicago and it was 100 times better and took 15-20 minutes to cook.  

I do love the Oregano's Favorite salad and the pizza cookie, but everything else- from the wait time to the pizza- are not worth going."}
{"text":"Called in for takeout and when picking our order up stood at the front desk for about 10 minutes before walking over to the bar for help. The hostess was standing at the bar talking to co-worker/ and was completely unaware that she had multiple people at the front. Our bartender a female with long brown hair (didn't catch her name) was awesome"}
{"text":"Hour and a half wait on Saturday night, ordered the chicken parmigiana with linguini...chicken was burnt and over-cooked.  Good thing the beer selection was good."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The wait can be long so hit it up when college is out."}
{"text":"Fantastic as always, great food, great place to hang out, great pizzas, great salads. Been going here since they opened the one in South Scottsdale.  Recent Pablo Picasso Salad over the top, fresh tasting chicken, huge salad, with 3 types of cheese, super hot salad dressing, chip strips, fantastic on all count and worth much more than what they charge! 5 stars now and 5 stars always!"}
{"text":"I don't live in Arizona but I have been there several times while traveling for work.  I ALWAYS make sure to stop here for either lunch or dinner every time.

The food is good, the price is very reasonable, and we normally get good service.  The main reason is the quality of the food.  From Pizza's to sandwiches this place has never disappointed."}
{"text":"I've left a review before saying that I love this place and they have great service!  Boy did my waiter prove me wrong today!! We had the worst service ever! He was rude and never came to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything! He kept passing by but would never come to our table. I was so disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tonight at 9:30pm we ordered 50 pizzas for the firemen who put put the fire just down the street for us. They close at 10. Not only did they accommodate us and were incredibly understanding and cooperative, but they made 50 pizzas in 35 minutes!! Thank you to the staff that night, the firefighters and police officers were incredibly grateful."}
{"text":"5 stars for the bartender \"Jeska\" alone. Pizza is good for AZ and they are pretty quick for lunch. The cheesy garlic bread is excellent as is the service."}
{"text":"I was happy a couple years ago when I heard Oreganos was coming to the far west valley. I have had good and bad times here but as of lately, the experience has been awful!!!! Twice our pizza taken over 40 minutes.... mind you, this is a Chicago thin crust cheese pizza. After waiting 40 minutes and complaining about the wait time.. the pizza that was brought to the table was chewy and way under done. After speaking to the manager, both times, we were told our first pizza was burned and they rushed the under done chewy pizza out to basically shut us up.. like really!?! What kind of service is that. On top of all that... I called to order a freakin Julius Caesar Salad to go and the guy said it would be an HoUR wait!!!! Now, not only can I not enjoy eating at the local Oreganos... I have to drive downtown just to pick up Oreganos if I want it.... it's becoming not worth .... two stars I because the food( when cooked properly) is worth it!!!!

Get it together Oregano's.........."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love this place? Been a few times to this location and never disappointed. Staff are friendly and attentive. Food is delicious and always hot."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars because the food was amazing as usual but the service was terrible!  Had to ask for drink refills twice, waited 10 minutes for a box for our left overs only time the waiter was waiting was when I was pulling out my credit card."}
{"text":"Oreganos is always amazing from there appetizers the Bruschetta and cheese bread was awesome to there pizza and salads!  This time it was exceptional because not only was our food awesome but so was our service!  Autumn was so on top of everything from getting drinks, bringing us extra napkins to our food hot!  We had a party of 10 and kids were with us she asked if we wanted their food before ours,  she was just great!  Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants Chicago style food because you'll get it!"}
{"text":"I grew up on Chicago pizza so I was leery... Oregano's was AWESOME and did not disappoint. Delicious pan pizza and Italian Gold Wings. Also ordered the Pazookie and it was phenomenal! I will definitely be back and I would highly recommend Oregano's to anyone!! Staff was also very friendly and the atmosphere was very fun and entertaining!"}
{"text":"Took 8 of us here for dinner tonight.  They are always consistent with their quality of food and we always leave with plenty of leftovers.  One thing I have noticed the last few times is that it seems like they aren't bringing out large serving spoons with their pastas.  This is a little annoying when trying to serve up the pasta."}
{"text":"I HEART Oreganos... The best thin crust pizza Ive had.. salads great... service awesome... I love the wines and the waiters that know them:-) PS.. aka let you even sample.. Friday nites on the Oreganos patio... with a good pizza pie and wine.. one of my favorite things:-)"}
{"text":"I have finally learned my lesson with all oreganos pizza restaurants.  This time we called to inquire about the wait.  The person on the phone said camera and over no wait at all. 12 minutes later when we arrive we are informed that there is a one-hour wait minimum.  The pizza is good the aggravation and annoyance is overwhelming. I have discovered,   Their business model is built on tourist."}
{"text":"Just a few words this place is the best great service its clean great customer service."}
{"text":"had diner party here with 17 pp Joe was the server we had he was great are drinks where full all the time and he got the food out to us so it was nice and hot so ask for Joe"}
{"text":"I can't complain about the food - the food has always been great. That's why I gave one star. The service, however, that's a different story. Oregano's used to be great at their service but lately, it's been terrible. We waited for 10 mins before we were asked for our drinks, our food took 30-45 mins (without a pizza - which usually takes awhile and that is expected), and another 10 for our check. Oregano's needs to step it up. Until then, you can catch me across the street at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Super delicious pizza - I love the tangy pizza sauce. Yes, it's deep dish and it's not quite like Uno's, but it's still awesome and the thickest pizza topped with loads of cheese and tomatoes. Yum yum yum. 

The thin crust guac appetizer is also fantastic. Garlic and parm on a thin pizza base + their guac recipe is all good. 

Drinks are reasonable and come quickly. 

One tip...be careful sitting under the tree near the fireplace and olive oil poster...our friend got shat on twice. It was hilarious and we called him very lucky! Beware of the  bomb dropping birds!"}
{"text":"From California here for spring training, we were looking for a unique place to grub after being out in the sun. This place was great! The atmosphere, the service and of course the food was incredible! I had the alfredo pesto artichoke lasagna and it was to die for! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Chicken Lasagna and the BBQ pizza ,Bomb! The marina sauce that covers the Lasagna made me wanna cry, that good. Check this place out when in Az."}
{"text":"A new family tradition, you can find us here almost any Friday.  Best thin crust ever! 

The wait on a Friday night is a bit much, but there is clearly a reason for that.  Oreganos is great about bringing out \"teaser\" pizza bites and drinks as you wait."}
{"text":"don't overthink it.  it's pizza.  the crust is good, and you can choose thin crust or deep dish.  there are a lot of  creative specialty pizzas.  although i ordered one (Rosemary Chicken Potato ) with potatoes as a topping and it wasn't that hot.  it kind of lost all of it's taste to the potatoes and rosemary.  the salads are great, the pizza sauce is mild.  Picazzo's is better, but Oregano's is more than likely closer."}
{"text":"Second try:

So I am updating my review! Received the giftcard and went ahead and tried it again ( dinned in this time around ) it was PERFECTION.  We'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Holiday Inn across the street. As I didn't get in until 8 PM, I wanted something quick and easy and this fit the bill.  I ordered a small house salad and a small \"Numero One-O\" pizza as take out. 

Both the guy who took my order on the phone and fulfilled it, and the hostess were very warm and friendly! From that small experience, the staff is 5/5. From the brief time I was in the restaurant, the interior looked nice and inviting. My only ding in the service department was that it took 30 minutes for my order, about twice as long as most other pizza places. 

The food here was pretty good. The salad was unremarkable but the house Italian dressing is tasty! The pizza was good, thin crust style, a round pizza cut in \"squares\" (I prefer standard cutting ). Toppings were high quality, all in all a solid but not exceptional pizza. Unfortunately my main gripe is the price. $19 for a small, thin crust pizza? This is simply too much. If the pizza was $10-12 and made in 15-20 minutes, this would be a four star spot."}
{"text":"Oregano's is an institution in the Phoenix area and for good reason. It has a solid offering of well-crafted Italian dishes, from bruschetta to ziti.

Yet, when I visit Oregano's, it is inevitably for a helping of their thin crust pizza. It starts with a light, crispy crust that's cooked to perfection. The sauce has an excellent taste. I like to add a side order so I can top off my slices with a little extra. The cheese and toppings are fresh and flavorful. I recommend the pepperoncini's for spice, along with a savory topping to balance out the meal. The wheat crust option is also nice for a subtle change.

A recent sweet discovery, which was thankfully recommended by a server, is the pizza cookie. This massive 6-inch diameter cookie is served in the deep dish pizza pan in which it is baked. It comes in chocolate chip and white-chocolate macadamia flavors (or best yet, half and half). This dessert is a must-have, regardless of what you order, so be sure to save room and share it with your guests. The pizza cookie makes me not want to eat dessert anywhere else.

This location is close to the university and packed on a regular basis, which can lead to long wait times towards the later evening hours. I have heard others recommend alternative nearby locations, which are supposedly less crowded.

Lastly, I'll relate a story from one of my first visits to Oregano's. In brief, we ordered a pizza and started to wonder what was going on after about 90 minutes of waiting. Shortly after and without any word from us, the owner/manager arrived with our pizza, apologized for the delay, and removed the full cost from our bill. This event demonstrated Oregano's willingness to take accountability for its service, which is all too rare. 

Oregano's is a place that you must visit at least once. I suspect that anyone who visits once will return many more times."}
{"text":"It was at this location that I discovered a delightful appetizer. Oregano's version of mozzarella sticks features crispy fried crusts with a zesty breading and a spicy, melted, pepper jack cheese center. To top it off, you get a side of true hearty pizza sauce for dipping (not that wimpy marinara that you get elsewhere). The thing is, you won't want to dip, because they are so tasty on their own. But not all is lost, because the pizza sauce is good for eating straight out of the cup. 

Although I specifically discussed a lighter cooking of the pizza cookie with our server, who agreed that it isn't supposed to be charred, it nevertheless came out overdone. I'm not sure what it is, but 75% of the time across all of the Oregano's I've visited, the pizza cookie has come out overdone. Alas, this is a dessert that tastes substantially worse once it becomes overcooked and requires delicate attention. Now that I have discovered La Bocca on Mill has a superior version of this dessert, I won't be ordering it anymore when I visit Oregano's."}
{"text":"Oreganoes is fantastic, the pizza is alot better than main stream pizza and hole in the wall places.  

The wings of fire is probably the best tasting in town.  the food portions are massive and reasonably priced.

there is always a wait for lunch or dinner so its a great place to go for off hour eating.

the pizzuki is standard issue, but i'm not really a desert person so I can't say if its good or bad."}
{"text":"Pizza was fine as well as the wings but I did a call ahead order and when I arrived it took the staff 20 minutes to ask me why I was standing waiting for my to go order which when I finally paid and got food it was sadly Luke warm I mentioned to the girl and 2 guys that I had waited a very long time 25 minutes for food and additional 20 waiting for them to help me sigh not cool"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza! We were here for a graduation and ordered this to-go the first night we were in town. Ordered waffle fries as well. Our total for the large pizza and fries was $32! Pretty steep. But it fed four people with leftovers! Would eat here again if I were to EVER go to Arizona again, lol."}
{"text":"We had the Lasagna, Rigatoni, and the Pablo Picasso's Chicken salad... everything was awesome... great food worth waiting for... fantastic ambiance..."}
{"text":"Bollo pasta is always my go-to. Sometimes the wait/lines are horrible especially in the heat. Still great food though."}
{"text":"Just went here the other day and made mistake of sitting outside man do we have winter here or what? I was already burning up in the midday sun. But the food was great and I always order enough to bring home since it taste good the next day as well. I love this place and would go more often if it was not so pricey. Please give this try least once."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! Plan for a wait though. My friend and I try and go on a fairly regular basis and we just plan to wait and have drinks so it's not really a big deal. We love the Pesto Pizza which is a thin crust, with duh... Pesto, tomato and cheese. It's rather simple but oh so yummy! Their whole wheat crust is yummy too. Their salads are huge so make sure to share and don't forget to order a pizookie. You won't be sorry! With 3 flavors to choose from and all three sampled the classic chocolate chip is by far the best! 

Deep dish pizzas take like 45 min to make so plan for that also. It's one of the reasons we always order a thin crust!"}
{"text":"Very great Italian restaurant. Two of my buddies work there and turned me onto the grandmas G rosemary chicken pizza, deep dish pizza is always the best, and the chicken Caesar salad for an appetizer is great! Love this place. oh and the Pizza cookies are really good all three flavors are bomb!!"}
{"text":"I normally love this place, but it's clear that service standards have gone downhill.  Today, my wife and I intentionally planned a late lunch at Oregano's to avoid the rush.  We were quickly seated since there weren't many people there, and ordered a large margherita pizza with light cheese, extra sauce, and two garden salads.  We made a point of ordering with their light balsamic dressing to avoid added sugar, as my wife has a medical condition.   I opened my wrapped silverware to find leftover food caked and dried to the knife.  I asked the waiter for a replacement set, and while he did get it, he didn't say a word; just dropped the new ones and  walked off.  As the waiter left, and I suggested my wife check her silverware also.  It was a good thing I did, as hers was easily three times worse.  I couldn't believe the dishwasher did such a poor job and didn't catch this problem, and neither did the person who wrapped the silverware!  Inexcusable. Our salads arrived and were great, but I noticed my dressing had normal consistency, but my wife's was extremely thick, like chocolate pudding.  When our pizza arrived, we asked the girl who brought it what the difference was in the dressings, since we had ordered the same thing as one another.  \"Oh, the one your wife had is our HONEY BASIL,\" she said.  WTF?!! So, great, now we have to race home and monitor her sugar levels and possibly make a trip to the ER.  We pointed out this problem and that we'd specifically ordered things to avoid this, asking them to wrap up our pizza to go since we couldn't sit there waiting to see how she'd react.  All this time, not one person said \"I'm sorry,\" or \"Oh my gosh, we are so sorry for this!\"   The waiter rang up our order and presented us with the check, but didn't say a word or even make eye contact.  Seriously, this guy, from start to finish, couldn't have been more disinterested in his customers If he tried.  We paid and left, but as we walked out I did bring this to the attention of one of the managers, Nicole, and thankfully she at least apologized for what occurred and said to ask for her next time we're in.  Not sure there will be a next time, but we'll see.  Plenty of training opportunities here, Oregano's - I sure hope you guys can turn this place around."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to this location for lunch.  I got the Bollo Pasta both times with salad and meat sauce.  WOW!  Enough food to feed an army and I get to take a full plate home!? YES!  Combine that with the load of cheese sprinkled on top the pasta and salad, I'm pretty much in heaven!  The wait staff was nice too.

Why not 5 stars?  Parking is not great, it's always crowded and the service is on the slower side (probably due to the hoards of people here at lunchtime).  And also, my friend got the Big ol' Slice and I was very sad for her as the crust was so thin it was non-existent.  She left hungry but it was a relatively inexpensive meal as a whole.  Pizza slice $2.99 +.99 per topping; salad $2.79; Bollo Pasta $5.99 + .99 for meat sauce for EACH serving of pasta. 

I'll be back to try other stuff on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Great dinner tonight at Oreganos! This was our first time ever eating at this chain. I will say, after reading the reviews on here we were definitely skeptical. Sooo glad we chose to try it. It was awesome! We went on a Friday at about 4pm. They were already on a 25 minute wait but it was about 10 minutes and then we were seated. Our server was great, attentive to our needs, and was very knowledgeable on the menu. We started with some garlic cheese bread that was great!! It was huge as well! My husband ordered the thin crust pepperoni pizza and it was great. I ordered the Pesto penne pasta and it was fabulous! I would definitely suggest trying this restaurant in Surprise as it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner with family at Oregano's! Fernando (Fernie) was so great, very attentive and helpful with any requests asked. Made us want to come back and eat again soon! :)"}
{"text":"First I have to say our server Megan was great. We were in a little bit of a hurry, so I asked her which dishes could be prepared the quickest. She suggested any of the pastas or salads. We ended up with the Caesar salad and the big rig. We added meatballs and sausage to the big rig. The salad was so good the fresh Parmesan cheese and croutons made it wonderful. The pasta dish was also amazing. The pasta alone would've been fine but the addition of the meatballs and sausage made it a great meal.  

Note all of the servings are huge and can easily be shared between 2 to 3 people. Make sure and ask your server how big the dish is."}
{"text":"We had a part of 8 at 4:30 on a Monday. There were open tables and was not too busy. Wait was 1 hour, so we left and went down the street to Babos. We even called ahead for a reservation but the don't take them."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's but the music is obnoxious and extremely loud. This is my only complaint."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Oregano's and most frequently visit the University Drive location (review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/oreganos-pizza-bistro-tempe#hrid:8voZ-Ol5ovGYBkkQDjREkQ)

This location has more spacious parking and a larger, covered waiting area, both of which are nice. We visited at off-peak hours, so I can't say whether this location gets busy during dinner like the University Dr restaurant. 

The food was excellent here. We tried a thin crust pizza with applewood bacon and pepperocinis. This was one of the single best pizza's I have had. For dessert we ordered the half macadamia nut, half chocolate chip pizza cookie. 

There were a few idiosyncrasies on this visit, however. Our pizza took a long time to arrive and came with added pepperoni by mistake, but we were happy to have it. We ordered a pizza cookie and the first one came too burnt to eat. Our server brought it just in case, but had already placed an order for another one. This lead us to have to wait a long time, but we were happy to get a properly cooked dessert and the item was taken off of our bill. The wait staff were friendly and efficient throughout, although I wonder if there are some problems or in-training staff in the kitchen based on our experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in AZ! I always crave the pizza, boom dip, cheesy bread, and the pizza cookie. My  mouth is watering just thinking about it. The parking is usually frustrating, and the wait can be long because they don't take reservations, but the food and service are worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been eating Oregano's for about ten years now and after switching to vegetarian it is still tops on my list.  Their Veggie Wedge is really delicious and there are still many meatless options when dining at Oregano's.  

The Pizza Cookie is always on the list of things to eat and we always get it half/half.  

In ten years I have never been disappointed by the staff members or the food.  Great people, great fun and always great food.

The new Dobson/Southern location is the closest to my home so I have been eating there since it opened.  The location in Tempe and Old Town Scottsdale have been visited in the past. 

Parking has consistently been an issue when going to Oregano's, but the Mesa location has plenty compared to the other two I have visited.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A favorite in town for 15 years and even better when they move in down the street.  The best in casual Italian.  Always busy so plan to wait or get takeout and have a Kiltlifter at the bar!"}
{"text":"Good Food, Great Prices... HUGE PORTIONS!!!  you are buying lunch and dinner when you go... and you have to have the cookie skillet!!!"}
{"text":"We have tried twice now to order take out pizza (because usually oregano's pizza is awesome...) however, both times at this location our order was lost. The second time (we won't return now) my boyfriend stoop and waited 20 minutes after checking for his order only to be rudely told that his order was lost and it would be a 40 MINUTE wait. Then, it took over 15 more minutes for the manager to come and figure out the situation and refund him his money. What a joke! Too bad because we used to get their pizza a lot."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time to an Oregano's restaurant.  If you go at dinner time expect at least a 45 to 60 minute wait. However there is seating outside for the wait to get in and they call your name when the table is ready. We waited almost an hour on a Tuesday.

There are 3 different kinds of pizza crust, deep dish, pan and thin, I wanted to get the pan or deep dish, but the hubby always wants thin crust. And boy of boy, this thin crust is super thin, thinner than a tortilla, so being that way of course the toppings are few. 
As for taste wise and portions it was very good, and large.

Now the best things here are the salads!! Superb!!  We shared with friends 2 kinds, the Oregano's salad which had pine nuts, roasted red peppers, raisins, onions and more with an Italian dressing, Awesome, I couldn't stop eating it.  The other salad was a funny name that I cannot remember, but it had grilled chicken, tortilla strips, corn, black beans and an awesome dressing, it was the bomb!

And last, you MUST get the warm cookie topped with Ice Cream, holy moly 2 of us shared this and I could have eaten 1 all to myself. We had the Macadamia Nut, totally out of this world, warm gooey and wonderful! I know Chocolate Chip is also a choice.

The service was great, the hostess kept you informed on how long you would be waiting and how many more were in front of you.
The server was one of the best, very on top of everything and very informative, (he was also really cute), he kept our drinks full and cleared our empty dishes right away, and then boxed up our leftovers for us.

I will go back the next time I am here in the valley for sure, but I will make my hubby try the pan crust pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been in search of the best Chicago deep dish pizza pretty much since I was born.

I have made stops at such places as Old Chicago, Pizzeria Uno and various other pizza joints claiming to have Chicago style deep dish pizza. And I have of course discovered Zachary's Pizza in downtown Berkeley, CA, which I consider to be the best.

I have now discovered second best.

Oregano's Pizza was FANTASTIC the other night, with an outstanding spinach, mushroom and sausage deep dish pizza topped with unbelievable service. We also tried a stuffed portobello mushroom dish which was just wonderful.

There are still a couple slices in my fridge that I continue to find myself staring at, seeking the right moment to have a secondary experience with this delicious food.

Lastly, they have a \"pizza cookie\" that I'm pretty sure I can't live without. I've made it this far, but I'm not exactly sure how. I am NOT a dessert person AT ALL... this was possibly the best dessert I have EVER had. You cannot leave this restaurant without ordering one of these!

I highly recommend this great restaurant, however I must say that I was not impressed with the wait. We were on a waiting list for over an hour LATE on a Saturday night... guess you pay for popularity."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for our one year anniversary and the service was amazing. The waiter was super friendly and kind and so was the manager. They were so kind to give us the whole meal for free. Thank you for celebrating love and for your act of kindness!"}
{"text":"I am so happy to see  Oreganos growing and to finally live so close to one of there locations. I ordered take out and the order was ready when I arrived, great customer service and the food, like always, was amazing. If you have never been here, order the Italian gold wings, any pizza, cheesy bread and don't ever forget the pizookie. Best casual restaurant in AZ."}
{"text":"Best Oréganos Pizza in Phoenix.  Love their staff but even more grateful for their cooks!  All of their food is delicious.  Consistent w/flavors and served just right.  We do Dine-In and Takeout.  Service for both has been perfect every single time.  Great place for large groups, families and kids.  On peak hours, they do have long wait times but I don't think we've ever waited more than 40 minutes for a table at this location.  If there's a lot of people waiting...  they bring out samplers of pizza for everyone to try.  Comfortable seating inside... and oudoor seating available too.  They have watermisters on, on hot days.  

Parking is tricky at this location but after your first visit, it's not that big of an issue unless their packed.  

Large servings for all their plates.  Chicken wings are soooooo spicy.  It's legit!  Their pasta dishes are delicious and not two entrées are alike.  Pizza is by far THE BEST on their Menu!    I'm not a huge pizza lover but I crave Oréganos pizza ALL THE TIME."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Nice new location.  The fried ravioli is great.  Everything we had was very good.  Come early the waits can get long.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Yes, it's annoyingly crowded all the time

Yes, the wait staff will all turn and say \"HI!!\"  \"WELCOME!!!\" \"WE'RE SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE!!\" when you walk through the doors.  

Yes, the food can sometimes take quite a long time

Yes, it is a bit more expensive than other pizza/pasta type of places

However, despite all these things, I FREAKIN' LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!

I only order three things from Oregano's.

1.  Alfredo the dark with chicken
2.  Unlimited marinara pasta bowl thing with meatballs and peppercini's
3.  Pizzooookie.  Yummmmmm

The food is ridiculously large, so I find this place is much more affordable when I split an entree with a friend.

But yeah, I love this place."}
{"text":"Since I am from New York, anything that is Italian I judge to a higher standard. Oregano's has a nice vibe going on with okay Italian.  My friend urged me to try the meatballs, he said they were the best and I thought they were just okay.  I also felt that way about my Caesar salad, it was nothing special.  They could have jazzed it up some to make it a little different.  He had the meatball sub, which he loved (he gets is every time) but like I said, I set higher standards for Italian.  

Make sure to come early for lunch or dinner, this place gets busy quick otherwise you will have to sit in the undesired heat on the patio at this location."}
{"text":"Future Scottsdale trips will include Oregano's. Visiting my niece, she and a friend took us for dinner before bowling. I do not remember what all we had besides pizza and the slammin cookie dessert, but we had a great time sitting outside enjoying each other's company. I was so hooked. that I bought two of their t-shirts as well. Great customer service and it did not take forever. Maybe because it was it was a weeknight? Either way, we were all highly satisfied."}
{"text":"Delicious. The pizza is so good and the thin, crispy crust makes it even better. You can tell the toppings are fresh and that the pizzas are made with care. It's nice that they also have a big menu for those that don't want pizza - but you should have the pizza. Oh, and the pizza cookie... oh my god. So good. Our server was also new but he was awesome! Definitely would recommend this place and come back."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Nice place, Frank Sinatra Movie and music playing. We had turkey, meatball, beef sandwich. Thumbs down on salad, it was All lettuce 2 slices of tomatoes, 4 small slices of cucumbers, and tons of pepper. I'll come back."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Hadn't been there for awhile. I had the wedding soup, it was ok. My husband had the slice is pizza, it was big, I tried a bite, but didn't really like it. The other times we went was for supper and ordered whole pizza, I remembered it being really good, but not this time. Usually go to the one in Mesa and it always has a long wait time."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 5 star because of the bartender, Jeska. Super nice, friendly, great humor, and great service! Ordered the Picasso salad (which came out fast! *thumbs up*) - tried ordering a small but it was freakin huge! Def enough for 3 people! I hate to waste food so def worth the $ (not that it's a lot) because of the size - it's more than enough to fill you up. However, I would still prefer a smaller size at least for a lunch time special - I would probably visit more often. Ordered a kiltlifter and it was ICY cold just the way a beer should be! First time to this location and have to say I prefer it over the Tempe location.... 
So, great job Jeska & kitchen staff for the great service! Kudos to you for making my experience top notch!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I love trying local Pizza companies that serve Chicago Style Pizza. Oregano's recently opened another restaurant on Bell Road in Glendale and I could not be happier. I went in for the first time a couple days ago, and the staff was extremely nice. I ordered a Pan Pizza to go and it was fantastic. My dad heated up the leftovers the next day and said it was the \"best next day heated up pizza\" he ever ate. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant, love their 18'' pizza."}
{"text":"Food was delicious as always.  Went there tonight... no wait!!! Wahoo lol, it was a Tuesday, so I guess that's normal compared to a weekend.  We had a wonderful waiter.  He was very tentative, friendly and got our order out quickly, he even joked with us for a bit.  Love coming here.  Food is a 10 and prices are very affordable for what you get."}
{"text":"The family and I eat here regularly and this place never fails us. The kids beg for the pizza cookie so I use that as leverage for them to clean their rooms when we get home haha. But seriously good food though!"}
{"text":"So I just discovered the all you can eat angel hair pasta for lunch. Wow. I've loved their pizza and now I love the pasta. Great lunch spot and great service!"}
{"text":"I have two words for you... pizza cookie!  The chocolate chip ($4.99), warm and gooey from the oven with rapidly melting vanilla bean ice cream is to die for.  Oh, yeah, the regular pizza is pretty awesome, too."}
{"text":"What is not to like about Oregano's (besides the wait if you go basically anytime of the day LOL)  We always get their thin crust pizza, wings and garlic bread.  we compare all other chicago style pizza places to Oregano's and we have not found one that is even CLOSE!  The wait staff is always great and helpful and the food is always consistent. I never worry that the food may not be as good as our previous visit.  My husband and I always laugh because he had never been to Oregano's when we started dating 6 yrs ago.  I decided to take him one night. It was a Friday night at like 9 pm and there was still a wait. I told him that is a good sign.    We were lucky enough to get seats at the bar.  We ordered pizza and wings and when the pizza came out(we got the think crust) he looked at me and goes, How is this going to fill me up?  I told him just wait. He took one bite of the pizza and was sold.  He can't believe he had never been there before.  We try to go as much as we ca, but don't get to go as often as we would like.  We love that they are finally opening up more locations and we are hoping they open one a little bit closer to us so we can go more often."}
{"text":"We always enjoy our Surprise Oregano's location!  Tonight we visited with friends and the server was Chuck... outstanding and the food was delicious... but very large... we have enough for tomorrow!  Thanks Chuck and Oregano's for a job well done!!!"}
{"text":"If you want inattentive service bland food under coined pasta over charging then please visit this Oregano's"}
{"text":"I have only ordered take out twice but the thin crust pizza is amazing!!  What I am most impressed by is the customer service.  Great people on the phone and great service when I pick up my pizza.  My new favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"Not feeling this place. 

I heard so much about their freaking pizza here, and I'm sorry but you need to try Zachary's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/zacharys-chicago-pizza-oakland#hrid:D4WR-ODCz7HzmFihXKblQg/query:zachary's) 
and see what good deep dish is.

When I first walked in, EVERYONE said hello that worked there, which is fine I suppose, but its weird. Our waiter was helpful, but then later said it didn't matter how much I ate (after I said I was full), because I was just going to throw it all back up anyway. He apologized, but what the hell?

The food was just ok. A lot of freaking cheese doesn't equal good pizza."}
{"text":"A family favorite every time we're in Arizona!!  We start off with a large sausage and end with the chocolate chip cookie sundae...HEAVENLY!!  My 8 year old likes cheese and so he always gets the kids slice of cheese with a drink.  They also serve real parmesan to put on the pizza...it really makes all the difference to this cheese lover!
Highly, highly recommend to all!!"}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza is amazing. The salads are huge and tasty. The meatballs are so delicious. The calamari is different but very good. We also tried the wings with honey bbq sauce The service is superb!  I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"Soggy crust one side burnt crust on the other. Bad flavor."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner & ordered the Oregano's favorite salad with chicken. They bring the salad out with no chicken. I tell the lady who brought the salad (not my waiter) that I had it with chicken.. So I go to hand her the salad as I'm expecting a new one brought out since that is what you are supposed to do.... The staff member goes to take it & then says oh I'll just bring you some chicken.. I said no that's okay & she says go ahead eat I'll have it brought out... Are you serious-that ruined the meal right there...I don't care how busy you are there is no excuse for laziness and poor customer service. My waiter later brought out a side of chicken to dump in my salad..That is ridiculous take the meal back & bring me back what I ordered correctly. I called the manager when I got home later (I should have asked for the manager while I was there but didn't)  & she said they never should have done that & she was sorry I had a bad experience... She further said she hoped I would give them another try... Really that's how you handle an unsatisfied customer by simply saying you're sorry! Wow Oregano's I expected more from you that that. I'm a regular customer but won't be anymore if this is your new standard of customer service well lack there of making the customer suck it up ignoring what they ordered just because they didn't want to take the meal back & make it again. It's really pathetic because the food is typically really good but the bad customer service ruins it!"}
{"text":"We love the thin crust pizza and the anti-pasta salad here.  As for Italian dishes, they are best described as similar to Olive Garden but larger.  We had hoped they would be much better and hence 4 stars as the pizza and salads are 5 stars as is the service!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place I take people from out of town. The atmosphere is great and service is fantastic. There is something on the menu for everyone. I love the lasagna personally. Great place for family and friends"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful allergy friendly experience here! The manager came out personally to go over the menu with me and worked closely with the waitress to accommodate our several allergies. Excellent service and yummy food."}
{"text":"Long overdue review. We were in a few months ago. Very busy night... and we were having such a good time that we didn't notice how long the food was taking. 

Manager came over and comped the entire meal. And yes we had drinks, deep dish pizza, and of course those pizza cookie things. Must have been over $250 for all of our food and drinks and it was entirely free.

Needless to say, huge tip. Awesome staff! You guys rock!

The pizza was so good too... 

This is how you get the 5th star...
Going above and beyond!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, good atmosphere, great food. Service is decent, wait is usually quite long though. Often worth the wait. There parking lot is too small and usually you have to walk across tot he mall parking lot. 

Their lunch special is excellent and lots of food!!!"}
{"text":"I use to eat at the camelback location weekly when I lived in Arizona. Came to this location for the 1st time, ordered my \"usual\" and it was awful. A lot of spice (Ike Chipotle or similar) ruined the dish. Don't know if the Camelback location changed their dish recipe as well, but such a bummer. Lady is A Scampi was my go to weekly dish."}
{"text":"I was so excited when rhis place came to the west valley.  Absolutely love this place.  Never have had a bad experience"}
{"text":"Visiting for the holiday , went here last night. Service was outstanding, waitress was friendly and interactive. We all had pizza and it was the best we had in awhile. Thinking about going back again before we leave. 

You need to have an Oreganos Dallas!!"}
{"text":"I boogied on in for a pre-grand opening lunch and was pleasantly surprised. 

Often when a great little places branches out and goes in to the pseudo chain food business some flavor is lost, but not in this case.

For the launch party we had a special menu with limited options which meant i was forced to try something other than my usual favorites. 

We started with the cheesey bread. Garlic bread covered in cheese, what is not to love with a side of marinara. If it were up to me this would get a bit of browning time under the salamander.

For my main I split a deep dish with mushrooms. It was pretty good very different than the usual thin crust I get. But be warned a deep dish takes 40 min plus to cook.

We also had a salad with fried onions on top, it had a sweet and spicy dressing that was very interesting, the hot fried onions on top did heat up the lettuce a bit so a chilled plate would be a good idea next time.

What does look great about this spot is over the original one is the ample parking and patio full of fire pits and places.

So go check it out I can assure you a few hundred others will be there, so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"We came to celebrate my Husband because they have his FAVORITE salad ! We ordered 2 salads and 1 slice of pizza for my LO. 

Our food took 30 long minutes. Once it came out the salad my husband ordered called Kale Ceasar had barely any kale. They offered to remake it which took another 10 minutes. The second version looked like what he ordered. He waited so long my LO wanted more pizza. So by the time by husband finished his meal the additional slice showed up. The meal was horribly timed. Then when we had finished she asked if we wanted her to \"start\" a pizza cookie for us. For fear of how long that would take, we passed.

Our waiter seemed over extended with tables and other people were complaining about the wait. 

Overall, bummed."}
{"text":"The service was horrible! I had to ask for everything, the server forgot to put our appetizer in, it was only when I asked her when it would be out she realized she never put it in. The order was given at the same time, not sure what her deal was. It took 10 mins to get a kid's milk, a diet pepsi, and an ice water. 

On a positive note, the food after waiting 60 minutes for it was outstanding! I had the shrimp scampi and my kiddo received pizza. 

Maybe next time we will just place an order and take it home to eat."}
{"text":"My most recent visit here was quickly headed into the 2-3 star category, but thankfully turned into a positive one.  The restaurant was only half full, and granted we had a party of 12 show up at 7pm on a Monday night, they told us it would be 45-50 minutes of waiting for a table.  We even offered to be split into two adjacent tables, and still, the hostess was convinced it would still take nearly an hour.

So, we contemplated getting takeout, and were about ready to order when miraculously *poof* a table opened up.  The service was excellent, and the Big Beef Sandwich was great!  Good food, decent atmosphere, although the \"Legalize Marinara\" T-shirts are a little over the top, especially in a heavy conservative part of town.

Anyway, I'll be back.  The unique and tasty dishes will ensure that."}
{"text":"OK, this pains me to write this because I love the food at Oregano's. I have had great service at other Oregano's. The waitstaff at other Oregano's are friendly and fun. I really like Oregano's. But not this Oregano's and not today. My friend, her daughter and I arrived for lunch and were seated right away (very nice). It was not overly busy when we arrived. Our waitress was pleasant but her connecting skills were lacking. Anyway, as we're sitting there, someone tried to sit a fairly obese man at a booth that clearly wasn't going to work and they had to request sitting at a table. I would have been embarrassed that this wasn't treated in a sensitive manner...but that's me. So we order, a salad and a pizza. The salad arrives (again, great food), the pizza arrives and then the \"are you done yet\" kinds of questions began. We really had the sense they wanted us to leave even when we weren't finished (\"can I take your plate, can I box this up, are you done with the salad\") and yet, my water glass (I'm a water freak) was never refilled during the whole lunch. 

And then the kicker. The waitress came to remove the pizza pan and knocked over my friend's water (she's not a water freak)--all over her, the table and her daughter. Some even splashed on the table behind us to the point that they had to move those diners to another table. But not us, it was time (not according to us) for us to go. We got some \"sorry\"s from the waitress and manager (?) but no  \"are you OK?\" They gave my friend a towel and that was it. No offer of a dessert, no complimentary \"we are so sorry\" item. To be clear, we weren't looking for feebies but we were looking for better customer service, something that seems to be more and more lacking in some places. The way the water spilling was treated was the way the whole lunch experience was - impersonal, disconnected and inattentive.

I know there are rush times, I know things happen but there needs to be a greater attention to the needs of the diner and their dining experience. Other places (Tempe Oregano's for instance) do a crazy busy amount of business and still are able to make each diner feel important and well taken care of. I hope this Oregano's focuses more on the importance of taking care of their customers but I'm not sure I'll know because I'm pretty sure I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and pasta.  Took some friends here for a nice dinner this last visit and Oregano's didn't disappoint.   We only had to wait for about 10 min to get a table.  We waited at the bar and had a round of drinks.  We got some garlic bread and a salad which was enough for the 4 of us to share.  I had draft beer which was fresh and cold.  The others had wine which they really liked.  I had the coop de ville jumbo chick parm and it was huge and amazing.  I also had them add a side of sausage, which was one of the best sausages I've had.  My wife had the el diablo shrimp pasta which was my favorite that I tasted at the table.  Amazing flavors and a little kick to it.  Our friends got the Italian flag lasagna  and the big rig pasta with chicken added.  My friend doesn't like spinach but decided to try the lasagna anyway, and he loved it.  Huge portions here.  We all had to go boxes.  We still had to try the dessert they are famous for (forgot to get a picture). The pizza cookie was so good and I don't like sweets much.  It was plenty for 4 of us to share.  We got half white chocolate macadamia nut and the other half salted caramel chocolate chuck.  Amazing!  

In the past we have only done pizza which we love.  We love the thin crust.  Glad we decided to try the pasta this time.  It only makes next time that much harder to decide what to get.  lol   The Italian gold wings were pretty good too.  They made them nice and crispy which is the way I like them.  


The service was fast and very attentive to our needs.  The restaurant is very clean, and so were the restrooms."}
{"text":"Talk about great pizza! I had a Thin Crust delight that was right up the alley of a classic Italian/Mediterranean pizza. The ingredients were fresh and the presentation was tantalizing. 

The decor was perfect for an old school style Italian eatery (i.e. movies playing in the background that starred famous Italian actors). What stood out most about the menu was the classic Italian offerings fused with some South Western delights."}
{"text":"The wait is worth it! Friendly service,,, tons of options ... amazing thin crust and deep dish pizzas and delicious appetizers! full Bar and lots of fun interaction! MY favorite drink is the HI-FI Root Beer ... Spiced Rum Root beer and Creme! Yumm!!!!  The Bistro Classic is always our fallback, white pizza with garlic, parmesean, tomatoes and red onion! Can't go wrong on the thin crust pizza or the deep dish!!!  Very busy... hot and long waits and noisy!!! but again really good!"}
{"text":"Why would you get anything other than a thin crust Chicago style pizza?"}
{"text":"Had a great pizza and salad. Set at the outdoor patio which is just beautiful food was great our server Erin was fantastic will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Make it a point to come here whenever I'm in Phoenix. Definitely some of the tastiest pizza around and I've yet to have a bad pie. Had some garlic knots which are tasty as well....generally always some sort of line but overall great pizza...did I happen to mention great pizza in Phoenix? Yeah they got that..."}
{"text":"So, Phil the manager, assumed that we were drinking before we arrived at the restaurant. Served us all one drink and then cut us off because we were having a good time laughing. We were told that this is a conservative restaurant. I guess that means you can't laugh and enjoy yourself at this restaurant. We have been at a sports tournament all day with no alcohol. We were all highly offended. I don't recommend this restaurant at all. Phil sucks as a manager."}
{"text":"The food is always great no matter what location you go to.  What made this time extra special and worth the post was the service.  Jennifer was our server and gave excellent service and was just funny and sweet.  We couldn't wait to tell the manager, Pat, who in turn couldn't wait to tell her and to thank her.  Jennifer was so shocked and pleased she couldn't thank us enough for making her night fun and wished us all a very Happy New Year!  We will always go to this location from now on and ask for Jennifer.  Congratulations to Pat and Oregano's for employing such an outstanding person.  She should be the trainer for every location."}
{"text":"Four severs smiled and greeted me with \"Hello, Welcome! How are you?\" on my way to our table! The server we would up with,  Karina, was among the best I've ever had anywhere.  I travel for work and eat at a lot I'd four and five star restaurants.  When I have this kind of experience at a casual eatery, it's a big deal! 
We had the Garlic Cilantro Parmesean Wings. The were literally life altering!  Our main course was the pan pizza Numero One-O. Wow!! Sensational!  When we were ready to leave, I asked for the manager and told her about our great experience.  She gave us a Salted Caramel Pizza Cookie. I am still in orbit! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant! Love the decor and the beer garden. The service here was spectacular. I don't know what it is about Arizona, but I have not had bad service here ever! Everyone is so friendly! The food was good. The menu was a fun read. All the names of the dishes were cute and had \"punny\" descriptions. Lots of food for your money. You could easily share an entree."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars here, but after tonight - never again. We placed a phone order an hour and a half ahead of time. After arriving, tweedle dee says it's not ready yet, *without even checking*.  So I sit and wait. And wait. And wait for half an hour longer. Eventually, tweedle dumb goes and checks the warmer, in plain sight of the waiting room, and calls me up for our pizza. It had been sitting there for half an hour! On top of that, it was missing toppings we ordered.

It gets better, though. I get home, and not only is it cold, it's also undercooked. Two hours of waiting for cold, undercooked pizza with missing toppings.

I'm sure there'll be an excuse about being busy, and there were certainly some busy individuals there, but there were a LOT of people standing around too. Including tweedle dee and tweedle dumb sitting at the counter taking phone orders.

Signed, really disappointed."}
{"text":"Deep dish pizza is delicious. Our server was incredibly nice and friendly. We got a salad as well that made for a great appetizer. It is a cute place with fun decorations. We had a lot of fun and will definitely be back! I would highly recommend trying this place!!"}

{"text":"too pricey.not worth it huge hype, but, not worth it in the long run"}
{"text":"Oreganos is a fun restaurant and their food is pretty yummy. Portion sizes are Cheesecake Factory style -- enough to share or to take home for another filling meal. 

However, the restaurant is really dirty and for this reason I cannot give it more than two stars.

I have been to this location many, many times. More than 20. Each time I go there are flies EVERYWHERE. Even our server was embarrassed and tried to explain why there were flies (apparently it's because I was wearing perfume) and lit candles at 2:00PM to \"attract\" the flies. I spent most of my meal batting flies away from my food and hair. So gross.

After looking around for to figure out WHY there were flies I noticed just how filthy the restaurant is: there are splatters of what I assume is food on the blinds and a build up of what look like years of crumbs on the window sills, especially in the corners. (The booths that line the walls are next to windows). It was so gross I wouldn't have wanted to touch the blind cord to open the shades without a Clorex wipe. Ew. I can't believe that this popular of a restaurant doesn't take the time to wipe down their windows -- even just once a month.

I honestly don't think I will be back here anytime soon. I need to forget how grossed out I am before venturing back to this place. It very well could be that the flies were attracted to my perfume but if that's the case why am I never bothered by flies any where else?

On a positive note the service was great. 

Seriously, just clean the place and find a way to fix the fly issue."}
{"text":"Went ther for the first time with my daughter last week. When we got our pizza there was a mistake with the topping on half of it. The manager IMMEDIATELY made a seperate pizza with the correct toppings and at no charge. He apologized and I tld him it was no problem. Greta pizza and outstanding customer service, thanks!"}
{"text":"Worst Italian food we have had. The Iced tea was weak. The lettuce was limp and the dressing was blah. The chicken Alfredo was tasteless and we could even finish it. The sauce was minimal. The restaurant was also dirty."}
{"text":"top 5 best places for bisto.  the meatball grinder and the think crust pizza is about the best anywhere"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Today was my first visit and what a great and tasty pizza from the first bite! Our server Lydia was excellent! I'll visit this place more often."}
{"text":"Let's just get this straight... ANDREW is THE best waiter ever! We always come in with a group of 10 or more to hangout and have dinner with friends and he has always severed us. Great personality and really cares for you. He's the best waiter I had ever had.

Other then that. Food is great better then Olive Garden and actually taste great and doesn't leave you feeling slow."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. Guaca-Tony was super delicious. Wings were a little fatty, I probably wouldn't order them again. Eggplant Parmesan was good. Pizza cookies were delicious. The price is right, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm a regular for their meatball subs with sweet potato fries and aioli. So much so I'm beginning to look like a meatball! I wish the kids meal was a little more extensive. They do give the kids dough to play with and they'll bake it for them too. Picky as my husband is, he didn't like the pizza, which I know is sacrilege for some, but he's a pizza snob. He does like the Italian sub and said the Italian sausage was \"wonderful\" a little sweet and a little spicy, made fresh daily. If it can please that persnickety guy who eats sausage a minimum of once a week, must be good. So, a little something for everyone. Tip: order the junior size, neither of us has ever been able to even finish that! And the salads I've seen could feed four. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Usually have a brother-in-law dinner as often as possible. Always order the same, Chicago Stuffed Numero Uno, and then and order of Italian medium gold wings. Always sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders."}
{"text":"So we went my husband and I today to have a late lunch at Oregano's. I've been wanting to try this branch for a while now but every time we were at downtown Gilbert, the lines were out the door so we never had the chance to try it. Today I decided to call before we went and to my surprise they were open and had no wait so we headed there immediately. 

We were seated as soon as we walked in and our waitress took our drink orders and gave us time to look at the menu. Although we were very hungry, my husband and I decided not to order appetizers because my husband knows their portions are very big. So we ordered the eggplant pasta dish and the O-Riva pizza. The first issue we encountered was the delay. After we placed the order, we had to wait for over 30 min for the food to come out. All during which no one came to us to apologize for the delay or to let us know that they were following up with our order. We didn't see our waitress at all till a few min before the order came out and she didn't talk to us. When the food came, no one said any thing either, as if it's customary to wait that long for food here!

So the food looked great however I must say, it looked better than it tasted. The pizza was so full of Kalamata olives, it overpowered everything else on the pizza, we honestly did not enjoy it very much. As for the eggplant pasta dish, it was ok but to me, it was flat. The marinara sauce was disappointing, it really didn't have much flavor other than plain tomato! 

I was so excited to finally go to Oregano's having tried it once before about a year ago now in Scottsdale and while my first experience was great (and I should have written a review then), this one was not up to par and I left disappointed. 

I'm Really hoping our next visit to this location will be much better. I'm not giving up on the restaurant yet and will give it another chance!"}
{"text":"Just got take out from here. Ordered extra sauce on both pastas and salad. No extra sauce. Coming from a guy who used to work for this company and I get take out from here often, the sauce was not even up to the normal standards. Called to let the manager \"ED\" know what was up and while explaining to him, he says to me he has other stuff to do. Wow, awesome customer service ED, keep it up."}
{"text":"Bistro classic pizza....Yum yum! And the Belinnis are the best."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Oreganos.  Their pizza is so yummy.  My family usually gets the meatball pizza.  I love the thin crust.  We tried the whole wheat crust a couple of times but this type usually gets burnt.  Their salads are amazing.  Their staff is always super friendly and nice.  It is usually too busy and crowded for my liking but I know the reason is because this place is fantastic.  My boyfriend came in from England and stated this is easily the best pizza he has had (and the Caesar salad was the best too).  The atmosphere is neat but reminds me of a lot of places...  The birthday pizza cookie is perfection.  If you haven't been here yet-- what are you waiting for?? This place is awesome. :)"}
{"text":"Love me some Organos!!!!  Came in with 9 family members from the midwest.....of course they all needed separate checks......our waitress took it like a champ.....BIG KUDOS! I know thats a nightmare, but she didn't flinch a bit!"}
{"text":"Food took a decent amount of time to get on the table but nothing crazy. Sat at the outdoor bar (it can be noisy) but that's expected. Salad was HUGE and very fresh"}
{"text":"We were impressed with the \"live wait time\" feature and it helped make our dinner decision. According to the wait time, we were to be seated in 15 to 25 minutes. Well, an hour and a half later my very grumpy family was seated. Moral of this story: Don't rely on this feature and be prepared to wait a long time to eat here."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style pizza.  Sat outside to enjoy the weather.  Very attentive server.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great Service. The food was good. The lasagna was a little too spicy for me. I want to try their pizza next. Parking was crazy and long wait times are negative factors."}
{"text":"Last night my family placed an order to go.  Two pizzas and a salad.   The regular pizza was ordered with pepperoni, mushroom and onion was cooked to a crisp and burned in spots.  It was extremely dry and the cheese was over cooked.   No tomato sauce.  Similar to dry toast with burnt cheese.    The second pizza was a deep dish pizza.   It was like a large ball of cheese.   Usually we enjoy their pizza, but not last night.   The Pablo Picasso salad was very good.    Usually we enjoy their food.   They need to work on providing good food more consistently."}
{"text":"The pizza was recomendet by friend pizza was great il give it a 4 star cause my favorite pizza place was in Vegas  service was great."}
{"text":"While creating my pizza list, I was actually surprise I had not written a review for Oreganos. So here goes my review so I can add on to my list.

This is a great place for dining in a big group. My friends and I like to get together for dinner here sometimes. There are pizzas (and many variations of it), wings, salads, sandwiches and pastas on the menu. There's bound to something for everyone here which makes group dining easier. 

For the pizza, you can choose between thin, stuffed or pan crusts. I always go for the thin crust and my favorite is the chicken pesto one. They have signature pizzas or you can create your own. There are many different toppings to choose from (even carnitas & cotija cheese) and the combinations are endless. 

I also like that they have my favorite type of wings here- golden wings. Yummy. And they are quite large, too. 

For dessert, share a pizza cookie. It comes hot out of the oven and topped with some ice cream. Perfect ending to close out a meal."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is good. I love the stuff Riga tony. For lunch on the weekday I had the calzone and that was fantastic too. I love the meatballs! We always get the waffle fries for the appetizer. The service is always fantastic, and the 40's music reminds me of my childhood with my Italian grandmother."}
{"text":"We really enjoy this restaurant, one of the must go to places  when we visit Phoenix. The pizza is delicious, price is reasonable and the service is great. We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I have loved Oregano's for over a decade.  The Scottsdale locations, Tempe and Gilbert.  Always have consistently good service and excellent food.  This is the first place we take out-of-town visitors.

We were very excited when a westside location opened; however, it seems to be struggling to meet the Oregano's standards.  Service is inconsistent at best and has been sub par 7 out of the 9 times we've been.  

The staff (servers and bartenders) seem green rather than sprinkled with seasoned vets from other locations.  The manager is very friendly and knowledgeable about how new locations are chosen but not in how to keep the hostess station attended to.

On other more anecdotal notes: #1 the bar is too small to keep up with service. #2 having only one women's restroom with a working latch on the door doesn't convey Oregano's quality to me."}
{"text":"It's the same great food and same great waitstaff.  This was our spot post-race last year, and I wanted to come back to indulge in pizza, bellinis, and sweet potato fries after shuffling my feet for nearly 4.5 hours over 26 miles.

If I'm rating on pizza alone, it isn't close to the best, but for a local chain, it's up there.  Oregano's is just one of those great hangout spots."}
{"text":"Love love love  Oranano's
Kimberly had the best birthday dinner . Thank you Vanessa for being the best server,you really know how to treat your customers ."}
{"text":"If you've been to any Oregano's anywhere, you know what the food here is like. If you like the food, you like it. I find it much too salty and not really worth the long wait.

This particular joint is always busy to the point of overcrowding for lunch and dinner. Service is good and they have outdoor seating. Despite decent servers you will have a wait, either to sit down at all, or quite a wait for your pizza. Takeout is a good option. 

Parking is a problem because the restaurant doesn't have enough, so there is spillover into the local neighborhood. BE CAREFUL: People who have been drinking tend to drive out of there without even looking. Do not leave any valuables visible in your car, not even a CD. The area around 10th St and Camelback experiences a lot of smash and grab theft and even assault, so be aware of your surroundings. It's a good neighborhood, but buzzed, well-fed people are easy marks.

The negative review is because I think you can do a LOT better while supporting a locally owned place instead of a chain. And because I live in this neighborhood, and we have found Oregano's most unreceptive to working with the neighborhood residents to overcome parking and litter problems, and an increase in crime associated with these problems."}
{"text":"Visiting from Tacoma and Oregano ' s was recommended.  The salads are huge... and the pizza was excellent too.  Ryan our server was tops.  Very attentive.  Atmosphere like you are in Italy.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best chain restaurants. Very casual, great atmosphere and nice patio. The servery brought a small plate with some bread dough to play with while we ordered and waited for the food. We had the Guaca Tony as appetizer, which was delicious. If you like good wings, try the Italian Gold Wings. They are awesome!!! When we went there it was extremely busy and it took a while to get the food. I was a little upsetting in the beginning, but the manager came to the table and offered us a complimentary dessert. The original pizza cookie."}
{"text":"Third time I've had their excellent pan pizza and it's delicious every time! My brother was here from out of town and we had to get take out. He likes 5 meats and basil on his. It was fabulous! That was his pizza. The rest of us got the deep pan cheese, but we kept eating my brothers because it was so damn good. The service and the drinks at the bar were just as great and you can't beat the jazz atmosphere. I'm eating pizza for breakfast too! One recommendation: Please put hooks underneath the bar for the ladies' purses because we can't hang them on the round back chairs. Thank you Oregano's!"}
{"text":"Good portions, fun place on a wide variety of food. Good people watching."}
{"text":"I tried this not long ago, but I didn't care for their sauce. Way to strong with more oregano then is needed. It is a shame, I was looking forward to it opening, because I missed Chicago Pizza that at this location. Their pizzas were much better."}
{"text":"This is a centrally located restaurant, I think with the best customer service of the Oregano's in the valley, that I've been to.  They are always welcoming, and instantly greeted upon arrival by anyone who sees you.  The only thing that exceeds their great customer service, is their incredibly menu full of fantastic different options.

They offer a healthier pizza crust, which is a thin, whole wheat crust for those looking to indulge a little, but still stay on the healthier side.  They have enormous portions so sharing is a great option.  They feature a lunch special from 11-3 which is really a great deal, and great food.

Last but certainly not least is the Pazookie.  This is the most intensely satisfying and delicious part of Oregano's.  Everyone who eats there ABSOLUTELY needs to order this... it is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Wow!  We're from Missouri and just happened upon this place.  Fantastic food-smart and efficient service.  Sausage was the best ever.  We had the Numero Uno-thin crust.  Every bite perfect.  Split a small salad. Left full!  Feta cheese and kalamata olives were a super touch-upbeat fun atmosphere and worth the wait which for us was half hour.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"My Favorite Pizza Place in the State! Funny thing is even though it's a pizza-Italian food place I always get an order of the waffle fries. They are so good. I am a huge fan of their deep dish pizza, not the stuffed one although that is really good too, because of its buttery crispy bottom. The salad I would recommend is the \"Big Beefstro Salad\"......Very good and full of meat. You can not go wrong with anything on their menu."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite \"chicago\" style pizza. The best thin crust pizza....... ever! I love the super crispy edges of this amazing pizza. This place is usually pretty busy and parking well.. sucks. Definitely plan on being here a little longer than most restaurants you visit. We always order the pizza cookie, formerly known as the pizzookie. It is the absolute best thing in the world. Makes even the most horrible restaurant experience ever, into an epic treat! I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss about Oregano's is. Pizza is blah and that's what everyone raves about. Salads are better than the pizza. Pizzookies are great tho!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu selection, delicious food, somewhat of a wait.  I would recommend this restaurant to friends and family."}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks. Make sure you leave room for dessert (I recommend the chocolate chip pizzookie)"}
{"text":"You may hear the muffled sound of gunfire but do not worry, that is just the adjacent gun shop.

This is the original location, the best location food wise and also one of the more difficult ones to park at without prior knowledge of the location.

For the past decade I have been meeting m family here for weekday lunches when our schedule permit. The key is to get there either before 11:30 to beat the rush to at 12:30 for when they leave.

Our usual meal starts with the Boom Dip, it is a artichoke dip dish but unlike the now popular clone it is artichoke heavy, lighter on the cream and has a nice browned cheese crust on top. It is now served with strips of pizza crust with cheese on it.  I like to eat the dip straight and put chili oil (yes this is a standard table condiment) red pepper and parmagean cheese on the bread.

For the main course, we split a Large Thin Pesto Pizza. The crust is thin and crispy. In lieu of tomato sauce there is their great pesto sauce, large tomato slices and mozzarella cheese finish up the package.  It is cut into square, with the four corner triangles being the best pieces.

The staff is fun friendly and will to accommodate. The patio has many mechanisms in place to make it bearable on hot dry summer days, inside has high top tables and blast loud swing music.  

I also enjoy the penne pesto bake, which is now in a bread bowl, pasta, cheese pesto diced tomato more cheese and a bread bowl. It is worth a try.

The Artichoke lasagna is great if you are willing to wait. 

For lunch, the pasta dishes include a salad and for dinner, they do not. I do not get it but that is the way it is."}
{"text":"I like Oregano's.  I don't LOVE Oregano's but it's not their fault my Mother is from Staten Island and I therefore am genetically predisposed to prefer pizza I can fold.

Lance S. and I went here last night to binge before starting a 10 Day \"Master Cleanse\" fast today.  Something I never noticed before, but highly appreciate, is that their wines by the glass are VERY inexpensive.  Since I made the switch to wine as my exclusive drink of choice a couple years ago, my restaurant bills have pretty much doubled, but at Oregano's I can go drink for drink with Lance and his tall Bud Lights without being the asshole who added $30 to our bill in booze, so that's always good.

As I said before, I'm not crazy about their pizza, but their appetizers and salads are delicious, and they have a gigantic cookie on the menu so you can't really go wrong there.  I haven't tried the pasta either, but that's another type of food I have impossibly high standards for restaurants to meet, so I'm probably not the best critic.

Basically, Oregano's is a great place that everyone likes.  If you think you don't like Oregano's, there's something wrong with you. You should probably go to Oregano's, get a $5 glass of house white and some apps, and work that out."}
{"text":"Never ever a bad meal here.  Great staff, salads, wings, and thin succulently tasty pizza.  Throw in a couple of meat balls swimming in sauce and melted motz and you have a night that you will actually miss, until you eat there again.  I love sitting at the bar here, the employees will always give you a great recommendation on things to try, and their local beer that they serve goes really well with whatever you order.  I'm taking my parent's here when they fly in this Friday!"}
{"text":"I really hate to give Oregano's a bad review but this was the first time we had eaten at the Scottdale Road and Shea location and the experience was not good.

We had about a 40 min wait to be seated which was fine because thats pretty normal for Sat night at Oregano's. We decided to order our food before we were seated since we were ordering a stuffed pizza. We put our order in 20 mins before we were seated.

After we were seated, we waited and waited and waited for our pizzas. I didnt time it, but we probably waited around 1 hour and 20 mins before our food came. We saw many tables come and go before we got our food.

Finally our food came and I couldn't wait to eat some delicious Oregano's pizza. Both pizzas were just bad. One had so much Cilantro on it I couldn't taste anything else. I have had that type of pizza at another Oreganos so I knew that it wasnt supposed to taste like that. Our other pizza was extremely salty and also not good. Even though we were extremely hungry we barely ate any of the pizza and took most of it home. 

I though maybe they would taste better the next day but both pizzas have sat in our fridge mostly uneaten will need to be thrown out."}
{"text":"Alright, this is the last time I am gonna give this place a chance. I have attempted to try every type of food they have here to see exactly what the hype is all about and why Oregano's is always at least a 30 min wait to be seated. This last time I went, I vowed to order one of the salads and their traditional pepperoni pizza because these are the items I have heard so much about from other people. I tasted some of the Picasso salad and a regular garden salad. Yes both were large, but all that came to mind while eating them was \"meh.\" The ranch dressing that came with my garden salad tasted straight out of the bottle and the Picasso salad was nothing impressive. I swear there was more tortilla strips in that salad then lettuce. Don't get me wrong, I love tortilla strips, but they are supposed to accent the salad, not act as the entire salad! Now on to the pizza... I had tried their Picasso pizza before and was not impressed. I figured I ordered wrong so I decided to get a simple slice of pepperoni pizza this time around. Nothing impressive to be honest. Too much cheese that was melted but not gooey almost like it had been sitting, the marinara sauce was nothing special and it really didn't have any flavor, and the thin crust was almost non existent. It tasted like I was eating just a big blob of cheese! Plus, there was a small hair on it. Oh and I didn't even mention that for 2 salads, and 2 lunch special pizza slices, we waited about 45 minutes? I just don't get what the hype is about with this place. Maybe people in AZ don't know good pizza? If ya want good pizza, head to Nello's or Sal's Gilbert Pizza. Skip Oregano's. Unless your taste-buds are severely lacking, you are in for a letdown."}
{"text":"Things have changed for the better.  

Went back after a long break.  Had a great waiter, who kinda looked like a young  Daniel Tosh.  He did a great job; he was attentive, had fun with our table, took our order quickly, food came out faster than it ever had (by a lot!).  Food was good, as always.  I'll make sure to come back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I'm from the Pacific Northwest but my family frequently visits the Phoenix area. Every time we do, we stop into an Oregano's (the ones on Cactus and Camelback, in particular). We have never had a truly negative experience: the only complaint I've ever had was slow service, and that was due to how busy the restaurant was at that time. The food is always fantastic. The Bollo Pasta is HUGE (even though it's unlimited, you won't need more than one order!) and really yummy. I also love the Pasta Basta with sausage. The sausage is super spicy and flavorful, and the skin gets nice and crispy. It's AMAZING. Speaking of sausage, I'd also recommend the Famous Chicago Italian Sausage sandwich... the provolone helps tame the spiciness of the sausage, making it a great combination. And, of course you can't go wrong with the pizza. Perfect proportion of crust to toppings. As for the atmosphere, it is so much fun! The vintage decor is awesome, the waitstaff is very friendly, and the restaurants are always lively. If you haven't tried Oregano's yet, you have to give it a try! The long wait is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere! The food was absolutely delicious and the flavor in everything we ate was on point. I loved the menu choices and look forward to coming back very soon since this was our first time here. Special mention needs to be made for our waitress, Amina. What a vibrant young woman!! She takes customer service to a whole new level. She was enthusiastic and personable and you could tell she enjoys her career here. That's extremely rare to find in that kind of position. The manager Christine was elated to take our feedback and was equally as pleasant to deal with. #amazing"}
{"text":"Eric Max the bartender was incredible. He was very thoughtful and courteous. Made our night that much better by being quick with his drinks and highlighting our experience. Totally recommend sitting at the bar with him."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were excited to finally find a great pizza place with all sorts of drinks and even some beer on tap.  She had lived in Chicago and was sorely missing. Chicago-style.  Of course we ordered pan.  Please know this is a great place!  We do admit to being VERY picky about pizza.  The biggest \"OH NO!\" for me is when a pizza is cooked in a convection oven.   Almost stopped right there because very-airy crispy cardboardi'ish\" crust.  Big sigh. 

Almost tears..  Soupy mess on top that pizza. The amount of heavy-salted cheese used - just HEAVY salt- was extreme. Chewing a bite of pizza was a rough go.  Took me 20-25 minutes to attempt to eat 1 slice.  Finally had to quit.  Couldn't eat any of the remaining salt or the airy-no-flavor crispy crust.  Our mouths were literally dehydrated by the amount of salt.  Water, water, water with no relief.  Same this morning.

Make NO mistake, we will go back for other menu items.   And if your wait- person lets you know the small salad is big enough for 2 ...it's true!.  Big enough for 2 - you best believe it.  Definitely enough for 3. Maybe even 4.  Those we saw were incredible looking.

Wonderful wait staff.  Wonderful.  The menu - there are so many items we will go back & order.  Would take us going there daily for a month to cover items we wanted to try.  

Go.  Amazing place."}
{"text":"This review is based on my last 4 or 5 consecutive bad experiences at this location including a $200 pickup order during the Mayweather/Pacquiao fight. 
If you'd have asked me a few months ago to list my favorite places to eat in Old Town, this would've been in my top ten- no longer. I ordered food from here several times a week (pick up for lunch) and would meet friends or bring a date here about 1x a month. So.... I can't chalk up this bad review to 1 experience. This place is truly getting bad.
Normally, I place an order for pickup and am pretty well taken care of regardless of how busy they are. The last several times I've ordered, everyone plays hot-potato with taking care of my pick up... sometimes I'm waiting for 10 minutes for the bartender or the person who took my order while several servers are pretending to be busy because it's not their problem. 
In addition, I've noticed that my regular order (wings) has gone down-hill quite a bit. $10.00 for 10 wings is expensive to start with ... but, until recently, they were always huge, so I never felt ripped off. Wings have gotten much smaller and whoever is in the kitchen doesn't mind giving you a half wing or a runt here and there. Today was the final straw... they raised the price and my order was inadequate. 
At the end of the day, it's no longer enough to eat nor a value for the money.  

Note to owner or manager: 
I want to eat here and give you my money.  Please hire and train staff that are at least willing to provide service and take it from me. Also, stop watering down the soup and raising prices. I've seen a 100 places come and go in Old Town. I can tell you that alienating your clientele won't yield a good result."}
{"text":"Great fusion food. I love the funky pizza's and the pastas are fantastic. I know the portion sizes are redick, but thats the fun of this place. Good consistent food. Always a joy to go eat at. Nice to support local too."}
{"text":"Good pizza joint.  We had basic salad (chicken caesar) and mushroom pizza.  Good food .. good wait staff.  We had spinach artichoke appetizer as well that was really good!  Fun environment .. reminded me some of Buca de Beppo."}
{"text":"Not to bad. Been here several times but have to say the food is consistent. Today I ate light but they do offer perfect size helpings for the price. A friend and I split a small thin crust pizza and medium wings. We had plenty of leftovers after-wards. I have to say the price point is not bad. I just feel the pizza was kind of bland. For some reason it was missing something. The wings were great made perfect.

I dined outside and had no wait. I was immediately greeted as soon as I walked up to the hostess stand. As soon as I sat down the waitress came by to gather my drink and appetizers. I did not get an appetizer this time. The food came out quickly and the follow up from the waitress was great. The waitress and other wait staff did a good job waiting tables. I notice them working with other tables. Everyone seemed very happy. I will dine again but will order a different type of Pizza. This restaurant has a variety of different options to choose from."}
{"text":"Finally, some Oregano's in the west valley!  I don't have to drive to Phoenix and try to find parking or Chandler.  A good Chicago style deep dish pizza that is as good as any other deep dish pizza outside of Chicago.  I haven't tried anything else except the deep dish pizzas, but why else would I come here!  So if you love some Chicago pizza and can't make it to Chicago, this is a good alternative."}
{"text":"Never been to this location. Love it as much as the one on 67th ave & bell. Great food. Great service."}
{"text":"I just received the best service I have ever gotten at a restaurant. Kay was wonderful for our 20 person family. We are a lot to deal with but she made conversation with all of us individually and made our night wonderful. Definitely will becoming back to this location."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, never disappointed. I do wish the service was a bit faster and that the restaurant was larger so that you didn't have to wait every time you go there. Sadly we have had to leave many times because it just takes too long to eat dinner there. Wish they would hire more servers and cooks so that the food came faster. It would turn the tables over faster and then the wait would not be so long. Why can I figure that out, but management can't?"}
{"text":"Its been awhile since I have been, but the food is really good. Make sure you save room for dessert as its all about the  Pizza Cookie. YUMMO!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan when I call for take out order and I have to wait almost 2 hours for a pizza. The food is great and the staff does everything they can, but when they get backed up and busy - you may have to wait for your food. I recommend calling early on the weekends."}
{"text":"Got my usual stuffed chicken pesto pizza. Its a great pizza. This time it didn't have a top crust. So really wadnt a stuffed pie. Called to see if this was right,  Jordan assured me it was. Took photo."}
{"text":"While visiting my son out in PHX, he turned us on to this place.  It was jam packed and even though we had reservations the wait was still a bit long.  Once inside, I understood why it was packed.  The atmosphere was poppin' and all I saw were smiling faces with amazing looking dishes in front of them.

We sat in a booth surrounded by 50s nostalgia.  Our servers (we had a 2fer.. on the job training) were very friendly and super funny.  The newbie server was too funny.  He was learning the menu along with us! haha. :P  His trainer suggested we try the Huge Guaca-Tony for starters.  THANK YOU FOR THAT SUGGESTION!  It was sooo delicious and filling. I couldn't even finish my salad! haha.

Our entrees:

Pablo Picasso Mexican Salad
Big Rig Pasta
The Ol' Mexigano

The Pablo salad was HUGE - matter factly all of it was, but yeah.  That bowl is more like a 2 person dish.  It was a perfect blend of Mexican flavors.  I was able to eat just a few bites though because I was stuffed from the appetizer!

My son had the Big Rig.  The plate was probably the size of my laptop.  I had a taste of his dish and I almost had regrets in getting the salad instead.  The pasta was seasoned all the way through and the chipotle cream was the cherry on top of this mound of yumminess.

I had no room for the Mexigano, but according to my hubby... it was so good he was NOT going to share. lol

Even though we never eat at the same place twice in PHX, I would definitely put this up there with Lenny's on trying a second time :P"}
{"text":"This place was a surprise for me. My sister and her boyfriend really like this place but it looked like your average chain. The surprise was in the quality of everything. The two Pizzas we had, the traditional supreme and the chicken potato, were both really good in their classic thin crust style. Also surprising was the guac...perfectly seasoned. And the service was top notch. The wife also loved their wine selection. I opted for the cookie pizza instead...also good choice. Overall I really enjoyed the place."}
{"text":"The place is not very large and should be larger.   We arrived before 6 and were told they get busy about 630.  We had a twenty five minute wait to sit inside.  The menu has all kind of options.   The sign warns you to order stuffed or Chicago style early while you are in line.  They take 45 minutes to cook a stuffed pizza!  It's worth it.

I was really wanting to try the big rig rigatoni with the chipotle sauce.  But we tried the zucchini sticks, and the long wait for stuffed crust would mean taking a pizza home.  The zucchini sticks are really good served with ranch, I think I would try to get marinara sauce too next time.  So they bring this chuck of pizza in a deep 10\" pan.  The sauce and cheese are nice and toasty.  With pepperoni, sausage, and extra cheese, they can't put it on the pizza stand for fear of collapse! 

The sausage has a nice little bite.  The pepperoni is good but not as good as sausage.  The cheese spews out after you cut the pizza apart.   Great sauce with a nice sweet and spicy mix.  Plenty of real mozzarella cheese.  And the crust was prefect.  

They have great Long Island Ice Tea!  At $9, it's not cheap but excellent"}
{"text":"BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA EVER. The REAL deal! It took around 45 minutes to bake. This place was awesome! Great service. Great beers on draft. We had Lagunitas IPA and a Sam Adams winter lager. The overall vibe was super fun and very family friendly.  Garlic bread and marinara appetizer was delicious. Wish we had Oregano's back in Santa Fe!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is one of my all time favorite restaurants! I moved out of Arizona over 8 months ago and I am truly having withdrawals from this place. Throughout my four years at ASU, I think I ate Oregano's over 50 times.. Whether it was take-out or dining in, I was always satisfied with the food. They mess up orders sometimes, but they are so friendly and accomodating, they will reimburse you, re-make the food or give you a free pizza cookie. 

I highly recommend the cheesy garlic bread with marinara sauce and bruschetta for appetizers. For the rest of the menu, I think I've tried most of it.. But if you are a pasta person.. the Big Rig, Zany Ziti, The Lady is a Scampi and Alfredo the Dark are my favorites.. Pretty much the whole menu is delicious! I got the wings once and they were good, but I wouldn't order them if there's a whole bunch of other good stuff to order. 

Oregano's is really accomodating and will make any substitutions! I always got the Big Rig with the medium sauce they put in their wings and it was delicious.. or for me it was because I love spicy food! The only downfall is that over the years, I noticed the portions got smaller.. but that's just me being greedy about food! Don't forget to order the pizza cookie.. you can get 2 different choices of cookies if you want variety! Overall, I love Oregano's and I can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Andrew was amazing!!! He was very helpful with menu choices and even recommended a menu item that ended up being delicious. He checked on us frequently even though it was a busy Friday night. He was such a great waiter. Very attentive to our needs. I haven't received that great of service in a long time!! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been to this location many times, and this last time WILL be our last time there. First, the music was extremely loud therefore everyone in the restaurant was shouting to be heard. Next our waitress took our drink order and order she already had 5 tables and then they gave her a 15 person table on top of that! So we couldn't get her attention for anything we needed. Next, the manager brought our food out (because waitress was too busy) I ordered the Italian wedding soup and when the manager went to put it down he dumped a bunch of scolding hot soup all over my lap!!!! He looked at me, said that he was sorry and left the table. Not making sure I was ok or anything. I was extremely upset and when the waitress came again, I expressed my concern and she said she would let him know. We were at the restaurant for a good 2 hours and he never came back to our table! We got our check, nothing was taken off. At this point we were livid. How extremely rude to not address an issue that was brought up! My husband paid the check and I went to the car and he pulled the manager aside to address this. The manager had many excuses and said he was too busy to get back to us. Just like we will be too busy to ever return here. He eventually comped the soup and appetizer, which was a pitiful portion of our bill, but at least it was something. It's obvious that this man was a poor manager who does not care about customer service."}
{"text":"A little Christmas Eve lunch at one of our favorites OREGANOS. I was feeling hungry on this rainy day so I bailed on the normal pizza option and ordered up the Bowl O Pasta done my way. I added spiral pasta, meat sauce and topped it off with a baked Italian sausage link. My girl went with a healthier option knowing what laid in front of us food wise the next week. She chose the Vino Bambino Salad. 
This fed us for 3 meals ...delish."}
{"text":"Great food every time, but the wait and service can take some time. I recommend their thin pizza, pesto bake pasta bowl, and all the cookie pizza flavors cookies are amazing."}
{"text":"First time here visiting with friends from the area and I was pleased, very happy!

Pals got the thin crust pizza - SO good! --and baked ziti, I got the Alfredo the Dark with chicken (spicy, creamy, totally different) and shared a Beefstro salad (spicy too, but fresh and rich with oniony goodness). The portions are huge so be sure to share or have leftovers. We ventured out and tried the white pizza with bacon, but it was a bust. Dry and not much flavor. Spoke about it with Shawn the manager and he was gracious and kind and took it off our bill. Our server was sweet as well, so we are coming back for the good grub and excellent service."}
{"text":"We are from a state that sadly does not have one so we always stop when we find it. We have been to four different locations and this one was my favorite! No wait for a table and the service was amazing! Thank you:)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here over 200 times. So as you read you can see this as a regular's bias or as an Oregano's expertise opinion.

First of all, don't ever waste your time with the sandwiches. They are too big, the bread is too hard, and you can find something better down the street at Cheba Hut. The meatball sandwich is ok, however you would be better served to simply order a side of the meatballs. 

As for what you should order, let's start with pasta. There are four or five pastas that will change your life. The first is the Big Rig. It is rigatoni pasta with a creamy chipotle tomato sauce. It has a good amount of heat, but that can be countered by ordering it with grilled shredded chicken. The Big Rig is my favorite dish. The Bollo Pasta is excellent (with chicken or meatballs), the Ziti is good (although the bread bowl is gross and kitschy), the alfredo the dark is also nice and lighter than most of the other pastas. I would also recommend the big ol' ravioli if you are in to ricotta but make sure to order it with the sausage or meatballs. Mmmmmm. The chicken lasagna is also amazing...but it takes 25 minutes and is often over cooked.

Now to the pizza. The thin crust is great. The pan is average .The deep dish is special. I have had Giordano's, Uno's, Lou Maltati's, even Pacxi's in SF...none of them compare to Oregano's. It takes 45 minutes, but grab some boom dip, a beer, and enjoy the AZ heat while you wait for pizza heaven. I recommend just getting sausage and peppers. Classic Chicago.

You must end all meals with a Pizzookie. This is not a BJ's quality pizookie. This is perfectly undercooked cookie (PB, chocolate chip, or white chocolate macademia) topped with a generous portion of vanilla ice cream. The best part is the crusty edges. Yum, yum, yum.

A warning: portions are HUGE. You will be better served to split something or you will exit this restaurant like you are 5 months pregnant. 

I have been to all of the locations, including Flagstaff and Tucson, and the Tempe digs are definitely the best and most consistent. Go early or expect quite a wait. Especially during the school year.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the service at this location was terrible. I generously gave 3 stars specifically for the food.   My family and I went to this location about a few weeks ago. After about a 30 minute wait (which is expected), we were seated and it took a good 15 minutes for the waiter to even come out to greet us. We said thanks but no thanks and walked out. The waiter said he didn't even know that he had new customers! He didn't even try to get a manager or anything to compensate for the lack of service. I called them afterwards and waited at least 10 minutes just to not be able to speak to the manager, and the staff member didn't even ask to get my information in order for the manager to follow up.   I've been to the Location on Bell and the one in central Phoenix and the staff at those locations really set the expectations high for a great experience. For this to be a new location, they really need to step up their game with the service."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant.  It's always good and always busy.  The food is great, the service is on point with a positive attitude, and the location is good.  If you get the chance stop in, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We tried it once and didn't like it. The pizza had way too much cheese but the thin crust was good."}
{"text":"The food is very good but there are very heavy in their spices please cut back on your herbs! Not every body could eat like this!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend Oregano's if you've never been! It's always nice to show up prior to starving since sometimes the wait can be longer than expected but worth it! Their big rig pasta with chicken is to die for and their wings of medium with Italian gold sauce are amazing!! Their portions are very large, enough to share with someone! And of course, their pazookies (pizza cookie with ice cream) are a must! We usually order the classic chocolate chip! Love this location, will always come back!"}
{"text":"I love Oregano's. When I first moved here last year, this was one of the first restuarants I went to, and I've been coming back ever since - sometimes once or twice a week. I'll tell you why...

First, their service: everyone from the hostess, bartenders, servers, and managers are super friendly and they always take care of you. The staff culture really matches the decor and ambiance of the place- fun! even their t-shirts are funny.

Second of course is the food: whether you grab a thin slice for lunch or a deep dish for dinner, you will be glad you did. Everything on the menu is good, and definately try the pizza cookie for dessert.

This Scottsdale location is great. (service is awesome here) Bring your coworkers for lunch. It's also a nice, casual spot for a date, or share a deep dish with your friends. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant this place is pretty good. There are many different items they serve but my favorite has to be the unlimited pasta for like 8 bucks. Get there early because there usually is a loooooooong wait. Wait staff is normally nice amd the bathrooms are clean. Prices are affordable."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location 1-2 times a month since they opened about two years ago and am somewhat bummed they took the Papago Orange Blossom off tap. Even the staff can't figure out why they did that but whatevs. Despite this, I still come back for the guac-a-tony, brussel sprouts, vino bambino and Italian flag lasagna. The wait and bar staff is always friendly and food has never been a disappointment. The only setback is their current sucky selection of beer taps; hopefully they rotate them to something new and better."}
{"text":"The food here is very tasty, although the baked pasta dish I had was a bit dry. Fried zucchini was fabulous,..but they were stingy with the ranch dressing and charged for another serving of ranch. My family has a big problem with serving size options. The portions are WAY TOO LARGE. We have never finished our meal here, and Italian food doesn't reheat to perfection. Would like to see them give lighter portion options on all their entrees."}
{"text":"Looks like they have had a rough start at the new location - not our experience.  Two of us for lunch ... both with BIG appetites.  Ordered the Pablo Picasso salad and shared.  O M G .   So good, and so much food.  That's all we needed for lunch to satisfy us!  Great food, great service.  I am amazed each time I drive by at the lines there.  For a new location - to be flooded with customers - it's a great sign.  Keep up the good work.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"No doubt the food is delicious. The Vino Bambino salad is excellent.  Our party of nine could not be seated inside so we were forced to eat on the patio at noon today.  We asked them to turn  on the misters but they said they couldn't turn them on until it was 100 degrees. It was 94. A busboy  said he'd check on bringing the cooler out but he never came back.  Very disappointing that they were okay with us being uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The manager Dominic displayed poor customer service! The hostess lied about wait time being 45-1 hour. Instead it was 2 hours. Manager went on to say that was not what the hostess told us originally then he proceeded to shove the hostess list in my face as if to prove it was told to me as a two hour wait. We arrived at 545pm still not seated at 7pm. I watched parties of 5 get seated that came in after. All the manager could do was be defensive. I gave back my birthday coupon and left. We had a party of 10. I won't come back to this location. Even when the 10th street location is packed I'm seated an a hour. I've never experienced crap from the staff at that location as I did at Dysart location!"}
{"text":"NOT IMPRESSED. Went in for dinner on a Saturday night. Very slow service, very s-l-o-w. Noticed the table next to us ordered after us and received their pizza long before us. Complained. It still slow service. Ordered antipasto salad, very large salad but not one peppercini on it which was a featured item. 
Will not be returning:("}
{"text":"The service is great, the food is good, and the atmosphere is fantastic. The wait can be long if you go during dinner time."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Only gave 4 stars because there is usually a decent wait time due to the lack of space. Other than that, no complaints!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service (thank you, Kayla)!  Huge portions. The guaca-tony appetizer was excellent (thin crust pizza without sauce with a bowl of fresh guac in the middle). The Pablo Picasso salad was great. Stuffed Italian sandwich had schloads of meat and great flavor. And finally, the Puerto Peñasco Carne Street Pie:  somewhere between a mexican street taco pizza and incredible thin crust carne asada flatbread.  The wait can be long, but worth it if you've got the time."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, though they screwed up the order. The manager came and apologized and the made a corrected pizza. Only, it took about 40 minutes and they charged for it.  Rather tacky!

Notes:
Don't go here in a hurry, or with any other plans
Repeat your order several times
The wait for a table will be longer than committed"}
{"text":"Great Pizza! Always a wait but they seem to move people pretty fast. Tried a salad for the first time that was recommended by the waitress. It was AWESOME. Just wish I could remember the name."}
{"text":"We love having this Oregano's location. Always polite staff and not as long a wait as other locations.  Today's selection as garlic bread to start and a Bistro Classic pizza to share.  Just enough for the 2 of us.  I love the LARGE glasses so they don't have to keeping coming back for refills."}
{"text":"NOW.... this is a salad, The Anti-pasta salad! I always come here for different salads and this by far is my favorite one. It's enough to share between three people or left overs. The staff was also really nice. Sat outside in 95 degree weather but with the misters it felt great. Thanks"}
{"text":"My first time here and I loved it. Ordered the boom dip which was fantastic. Had he Original salad for lunch and it was very tasty! I will def be back to try their pizza and drinks. Our serve Kylie was really nice and checked on us a lot."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and amazing staff!!! The pizza cookies are the best pizookies you'll ever have! I'm a college student and this was a nice place go out for a good dinner and dessert under $20! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Brought the family here for my son's 18th birthday dinner.  The food and service were great.  Two stars because the menu prices didn't match what we were charged on anything.  We were in a hurry and didn't review the  bill thoroughly enough before we paid. When we got home and compared prices every dish was off by $1.50 or so.  Management either needs to pull the incorrect menus or fix the prices in their system."}
{"text":"Place lived up to the expectations.  Being a pizza and wing connoisseur, I was pleased on both ends.  The wings are a nice size too, no scrawniness here!   My buddy recommended the stuffed pizza and it was pretty awesome.  Although, I may have enjoyed the recommendation of the waitress more.  I think she recommended the deep dish.  Or was it the other one?  Damn lack of memory recall!  Ah...well, I guess that gives me another reason to go back.  The patio is pretty cool, too.  Had it not been so cold, I would have ventured out side.  Last but certainly not least, the waitress, Marie, was totally awesome.  She bumped it from 4 stars to 5!"}
{"text":"the check in online tool needs alittle tweaking, we ended up waiting an additional 30 mins. Otherwise service was good and the food outstanding."}
{"text":"Awesome food, cool atmosphere, and great service. People can bitch about the price if they want but if you want all of thee above you're going to shell out some coin for it. Our server was Connor- super cool dude, paid attention to us very well and remembers everything you ask for."}
{"text":"Can anyone say thin crust pizza...  

Everything on the menu is great, but I'm addicted to the thin crust pizza.

Tap Beer is around 4 bucks a pint, so getting your drink on isn't to expensive either.

My only gripe, which illustrates how good this place is, is that it is packed every time I go there.  

Word to the pizza cookie too... If you have the room, this will ensure a heart attack by mid evening."}
{"text":"One of the best deep dish pizzas I've had outside of Chicago.  We did take-out as the place was packed on a Friday night and we were looking at an hour wait to sit.  Girl behind the counter set us up with plates, forks, napkins for our picnic."}
{"text":"I would NOT recommend Oregano's!  There are much better options in town.  

On a Sunday night, I went there trying to get a casual bite to eat.  The server told me the wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Are you kidding?  

Then they had me sit at the bar table.  The waiter then kicked me out of the table.  Apparently, those tables were reserved.  He instructed me to sit at an empty bar stool.  It seems they were also reserved.  Rather than saying so, an angry mother PUSHED me out of the way.  Is that necessary?  A simple statement that there was a miscommunication would have sufficed.  

I really resent being kicked out of the table and being pushed.  The hostess had no other alternative than to drink in another section.  Would I really want to spend any money in this establishment after such an experience?  I will never go back to any Oregano's.   

A much better option in Old Town is the Daily Dose, just one block away.  The servers are very nice, the food is tasty, there was no wait and there were GREAT happy hour specials.  Check out the Daily Dose.  It saved my evening."}
{"text":"Glad we have and Oregano's in the Far East Valley. Got the zucchini as an appetizer a few beers and a large thin crust pizza. Server was nice and the food was great. Beer was cold. Very slow though. We were there 1.5 hours. If you have somebody to have to be after you eat you might not want to go here. Still gets a 5 star from me though."}
{"text":"Great food but watch where you sit!!  We were seated on the patio in the NE corner just a few feet from the bathroom.  It was fine until someone, um, \"killed it\" in the bathroom.  Then the smell wafting by our table made it hard to eat.  The food is awesome, just eat inside or far from the corner of the patio!"}
{"text":"After half a dozen or more visits we finally sat outside on the patio - fun Friday night in December.  We were feeling daring so we tried one of the specialty pizzas (Carne Street Pie - good, too much cilantro for me though) and were not disappointed.  We shared a salad and the best friend calamari in the Valley!   The lines for Oregano's are long so we usually visit before the big crowds hit.  We've never been disappointed in service.
My reason for only 4 stars would be, the smoking area outside (or a least where people elect to smoke) is too close to the tables.  Unfortunately we were there at the end of meal for a large group of smokers.  The first half of our visit we had to breathe through our mouth as the cigarette smoke almost choked us out.  (Have the smokers stand further from the patio exit and problem solved!)"}
{"text":"I can't recall if this is our third or fourth visit to this location - all experiences have been great.  Tonight we shared calamari (best around - strips, not rings, never chewy & always flavorful) Caesar salad (dressing on the side) and a thin pizza (Gorgonzola, sun dried toms. roasted garlic, caramelized onions and sausage) - yum, yum.  Our server tonight was Lloyd - (from England- we discussed seafood!) he was spot on with service - on top of the drink refills and timed the spacing of the food perfectly.  Glad to have this location nearby as the Gilbert one can get pretty crowded.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Salad was great.  Sat at bar ordered food.  When food arrived..warning, PLATES r hot???SERVER burned his hand.  Oh my....the foods was not even warm!! I explained food  cold and with a pleasant attitude the barkeeper took it away.....forever.  At one point he snapped\"we have to re cook the whole order\".  The mgr walked by several times and didn't say a word.  Finally after my companion finished his meal and I went back to the left over salad....I asked for my dinner to go. I was told the manager had taken care of it.  CONCEPT:  two people go out to eat, not good for one to sit while guest eats. kitchen, bartender punish you for not being happy with food.  Complimentary meal...not so much...shitty attitude..no repeat business...not in business plan. Have been to other locations and never an issue. Bad management"}
{"text":"The food at this Oregano's location is always outstanding. My only ding for this location is that the service is inconsistent which can make or break the whole dining experience. Safer to order takeout and eat at home to avoid long wait times for a table and hit-or-miss service."}
{"text":"Their pizza is always delish! Definitely recommend their thin crust. I usually get carryout as their dining areas can fill up fast and be unpleasantly noisy. When I have dined in, the servers are usually friendly."}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum. There are a hundred reasons you should love Oreganos. The food is delicious. They offer huge portions. Their salads are amazing and their pasta dishes are even better. The thin crust pizza is great to share. The staff is always attentive and super friendly.
Other reasons include:
The Pazooki - Vanilla ice cream a-top a huge steaming hot cookie.
Belinnis - Frozen Peach schnapps, champagne, and chambord.
Great atmosphere - old records and signs, oversized tables, frank sinatra playing overhead.
A great patio with heaters in the winter and misters in the summer.
Just don't go on a night you are super starving, because there is ALWAYS a wait at any of their locations and they don't take reservations!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really dry the last time... I can forgive once because usually food is delicious."}
{"text":"Best place to go, especially with in town. Great food and fun atmosphere. The private room never seems used so would be nice if they made that more seating. Also wish their patio was bigger. No complaints on food or service!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Giant portions. The downside a very long wait almost 2hours total."}
{"text":"Deep Dish Pizza is amazing. Can't wait to come back and try more! I wanted to try the guac so bad!"}
{"text":"We go to Oregano's at least once a month and sometimes we sneek in a second visit.  This is absolutely one of my favorite places to eat on a Sunday and also to celebrate life events.  Calling ahead to reserve a table isn't an option unfortunately but the wait is worth the food and experience.  If you are a party of 1-3 opt for a chair at the bar.  There are NO wait times and the customer service is just as good when seated at a booth or table.  We love this bar option! The food is splendid.  You have to try the Guacatoni--- its a thin cheese \"crisp\" which they call chips for some reason and right smack in the middle is this mound of fresh mouth watering guacamole (mashed avocado) seasoned to perfection.  It's got lime and basil (i think).  Maybe its fresh oregano.  I've been meaning to ask.  Both the crisp and guac have fresh red onion so if you don't like onions ask them to hold those in the kitchen.  Alright.. the wings.  I like to order them dry (without sauce) and I ask for them extra crispy with the sauce on the side.  The HOT sauce is made with several peppers , probably like a dozen and it is a level 10 for those that can't stomach some heat.  I have a high tolerance for heat so for the more experienced chili pepper eaters this sauce it about a level 6.  Great kick and so flavorful! Mmm.....  The Beefstro salad is a must!  The dressing has ground up serano pepper in it so it has just the right kick! I've tried so many foods at this place.  The thin crust cheese pizza is so delicious and it's perfectly cooked every time. Also consider ordering the Puerto Penasco pizza.  It has cotija cheese and the same beef in the beefstro salad.  Top it with Cohlula hot sauce and let your mouth water.  The sweet potato fries are a light and crispy. We always eat hearty at this place.  Can you tell?  The music is a little too loud for my liking and i think they finally changed out the tunes due to the holiday.  Thank God! We go so much we know the sound track by heart.  Guilty!  The lasagna if you care to try it takes 45 minutes to bake so call ahead if you are dining in or order ahead if you are waiting to be seated so that it's ready for you when the rest of the dinner order is served.  One more thing, leave room for dessert.  The pazookie is amaze balls!  You get about 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream with little chocolate chips.  We always ask for ice cream on the side.  You can also order a 50/50 cookie.  like choc. chip and macadamia nut for example.  Enjoy!  This place is a must try!  I really want to rate this at 4 only because the music is too loud but seriously.... the food is that awesome.  So what if I leave that place a little hard of hearing.  bah!  ---------------- Take out typically always takes 45 minutes!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had from the lunch menu chicken ceaser salad. Omg it was such a huge portion! Absolutely delish! I love that the chicken came practically all shredded on top, sorry I didn't take a picture. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food ...bad everything! food was brought to the table COLD from fridge TWICE seriously?!! no bread, and had to wait for almost an hour on a monday evening?? Not going back, no worth it at all"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that the Phoenix area can be home to such good pizza. Even though it is a small chain, Oregano's can proudly lay claim to being one of the best pizza joints in the Valley of the Sun. I try to stop there when I am in the area.

The restaurant is a fun place with kitschy decorations and a loud atmosphere. Think Bucca di Beppo, but with good food and more outdoor seating.

The thin crust pizza comes cut in squares instead of slices, but the thin crust, decadent cheese and tangy sauce makes the extra mess worth it. They offer Chicago Style pan and stuffed pizzas as well.

I prefer sitting at the bar for quicker service and access to flowing brews out of the tap."}
{"text":"This place takes forever! I don't mean forever for a deep dish because that's expected, I mean forever for a pasta dish! It was my birthday and all I wanted was to eat at a reasonable time and they couldn't do that even after multiple requests for time checks. Very disappointed because on top of that they don't grate fresh parmesan and also disappointed because when the food does come it's usually pretty good. If I wanted to emaciate while waiting for a tremendous amount of time for okay food I would move back to LA. Low grade for service. 

I attached a photo of me waiting for my food."}
{"text":"This restaurant was located down Channing Tatum and right on his Cactus blvd........hahahha.  That was the joke for us out-of-towners that day.  Anyhow, the pizza here was great.  We had to wait outside since there was a long wait at the time and one of the employees came out to give samples in the 100 degree weather.  When we tried the samples we already knew that this place was serious.  Definitely worth the wait and if you want to avoid the lines I would recommend calling in and taking it to go since there were a lot of patrons going that route as it seemed."}
{"text":"We started with the Oreganos Salad -  usual vegi's etc - nothing special - it was definitely not chilled enough. The drinks were good (should be for $7) Then we ordered a Margherita pizza. We were looking forward to a great thin crust pizza- but after hearing the ravs of this place, I have to say I was very disappointed. First of all, it was almost cold. It must have sat there at least 5-10 min out of the oven before they brought it.  The flavor was quite bland.  I can tell you at least 10 different places in the valley with tastier pizza than this. In fact, Paul Newman's FROZEN Margerita pizza is better than this - it is better tasting, crust,  toppings, and you don't have to sit on hard  wood chairs for 45 minutes waiting for it. Ok so we wanted some dessert -so how about some cheesecake?  They don't have any - first Italian place I have ever been in that doesn't have cheesecake.  So we get the cookie- wait another 25 minutes. Nothing special... So after 2.5 hours including the wait for the table - and $65 - wow- I can say this was a total disappointment.  Maybe it was just an off night???  Not sure, but I probably will not return.  Go to Grimaldi's, Pestos, or Floridinos in Chandler - all have better food, service,  atmoshphere,  and value."}
{"text":"I love this funky place! The staff is very friendly, the prices are great and the food is yummy. Go for it!"}
{"text":"we love the pizza and pasta. The apps are good too."}
{"text":"I wrote an extensive review on another site. However i feel compelled to share on Yelp as well. So in a nut shell. I had the best dinning experience I've had in years. All because of our lovely server Veronica. Thank you for treating my Mother and I so kindly. Especially since we split a $9 salad. You are a true ROCKSTAR EMPLOYEE AS WELL AS A PERSON! MAD PROPS!! PERFECT FOOD. 5 STARS ARE NOT ADEQUATE. THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  We went on Friday night at 5.  If you can go early it will save you a bunch of time.  Also use the waitlist.  We were seated right away with no wait.  When we were done with our meal and on the way out people were waiting 90 to 105 minutes."}
{"text":"Our family had a wonderful dinning Experience tonight here at our new Oregano's restaurant in East Mesa. Our meal included medium hot wings, Boom Dip (a cheesy, spinach & artichoke dip), a Chicago Italian Sausage Sandwich, a Moscow Mule as well White Zinfandel and the house Merlot.  Each menu item that we selected was tasty and satisfying.  We'll be back. Hook'em!"}
{"text":"Italian gold wings are crack!  Food is slow."}
{"text":"We had an awesome time here at Oregano's. If we could rate our server (Matt) we'd give him five stars. He looked like Thor and was a super chill brother. Also, you can't go wrong when pizookies are involved! #another!"}
{"text":"We stop by Oregano's the other day and i was really impress with the Roasted Garlic Chicken Lasagna and BOOM Dip, which is spinach, artichokes dip.  I like the pizza but try the lasagna and you wouldnt be sorry!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great but not the best part. The best part is the amazing service that you get from them.  If you just want to make a bad day great, go their and just hangout."}
{"text":"The place is fine once you get seated- telling us it would be two minutes and they'd page us- making it 20 minutes then seating us in the bar was ridiculous 

Manager said he'd find us a booth. Disappeared 

So did we 
UPDATE

Two days after this posted I received a call from the GM. He apologized and made it right- 

Changing review to 3 stars"}
{"text":"We were in town for Game Day USA baseball and decided to order from here for carry out. Not only did the staff go out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed (plates, napkins and silverware) the food was amazing. We ordered the deep dish pizza the New York thin pizza, garlic bread, wings and the huge guaco tony. Everything was so good. I could have made a meal out of the huge guaco tony alone. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our food and service was PERFECT! 


I have no complaints what so ever , except that some of the girls had really short, shorts. I understand is hot in Arizona, however the space was cool and there was no reason why I had my child point out you can see a maxi pad coming out of a girls shorts. That is how short they wear it. 

This is a hygiene issue!!! 


A dress code gives us a standard for our professional appearance. It establishes a standard that the average employee is comfortable with and can, with a few changes, understand and implement.

 How can anyone allow this kind of inappropriate action? I get the girls need better tips, and need to wear this to get better money by the men. I found my sever very professional and yes, he was a man but we tipped him for his great service very well. Not because of what he wore.!! I am really looking into finding the laws in AZ that protect people from this un clean environment. We had women rears all over the table. This is not Hooters and if my family wanted to see butt cheeks we would go there. I am hoping that all the oreganos are not like this. 

Please clean up your gals! The women who had jeans and looked very professional, I salute you for not needing to be naked to get great tips!! I have pictures that I will be posting so the public can see. If Yelp allows me to do so!"}
{"text":"Yummy flavorful sauces. SO GOOD. And great service. Travis was very helpful explaining everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Pizza is thin and the crust is amazing.  Had the Ziti in the bread bowl.  It's just huge and tough to eat it all.  We love to eat at the bar."}
{"text":"i love this place and eat there every time I'm in the area.  Pizza, pasta, appetizers all fantastic.  Plan to spend some time waiting for a table.  We always have fun just eating at the bar.  Yumm"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding food and service. Their stuffed pizza is absolutely to die for. Called ahead and asked for \"help\" in sitting 8 for my daughters birthday and their management staff jumped all over it. We had a great time and enjoyed some of the best pizza and pasta we have ever had. Cannot recommend them more.... warning... their food is made to order so on nights with high visitation patience is important. The stuffed pizza can take an hour BUT simply outstanding..."}
{"text":"I always got my chicken BBQ pizza or the golden wings but this time I decided to order something different. I ordered all veggies pizza \"LAWRENCE ORIGINAL' which have spinach, mushrooms and garlic. It was great!! Definitely feel so much lighter without eating meat.. yeah definitely.."}
{"text":"I love going to Oreganos with my family. The food always tastes great. I love the Pablo Picassa Salad, wings in Italian Gold with the hot sauce on the side, and a thin crust pizza normally a pesto pizza. After all this food with the family we usually enjoy a white Chocolate cookie with ice cream on top (the pizookie). The only down side is the long wait, but every time we go we are not disappointed."}
{"text":"Yum! My husband and I love Oreganos and have been loyal customers for years. I am always blown away by their exceptional employees and consistently quality food. They have huge portions so be prepared for leftovers and their Pizza Cookie is enough to make anyone's day! We always share Oreganos with our out of town family and friends while they're visiting."}
{"text":"I've experienced much better.   I love food, I just LOVE LOVE LOVE me some food.  The food here is... meh.   I've been three times, and my general reaction is 2-3 stars at best for each of my visits.  Hey, can I get that without the green chilis?  No?  What about... can I get this with the sauce on the side?  No?  Can I...? Never mind, she just WALKED AWAY.

After three visits with these folks, I have had a 100% consistent issue with getting seated- and this place actually earned its own tweet (I rarely tweet) because of the consistently snippy, unhelpful, and downright stand-offish response when we try to come spend our $400 there for a group lunch. So... two stars for consistency... that does seem to indicate a \"policy\" and hooray for you, to be able to maintain such a strict adherence to your policies.  I guess. 

It's unfortunate that there's one person on our admin staff that just ADORES this disaster of a chain, thus we end up getting dragged here for their annual \"work anniversary\" lunch celebration.  No amount of calling ahead to see what can be done to make things go more smoothly for the staff at Oregano's (why wouldn't you want to know that a party of 15 is on its way?) and I've long since given up on trying to make things go smoothly for our staff.    I know you don't take reservations, I'm not trying to break your rules... I'm calling with a head's up to let you know that we have a group coming in 2 days from now.  And when I call ahead as they open that day to let them know, and I get the same defensive reaction.  Again, not trying to break your rules.  Just trying to see what CAN be done- but thank you for the thorough scolding on all of the things that CAN'T be done.

The rule here -*******take note if you're going to be with a group******- is that they WILL NOT SEAT YOU unless every member of your party is there.  That last person who stayed behind to lock the door and then caught the red light?  No, no, we can't seat the other 14 of you, that last, 15th, person has to be here before you can have your table.

I've experienced this at the Chandler location once, in 2011... as well as the Gilbert location twice (once in 2012 and once in December of 2013).  

When I was a kid (oh yes, I went there), there was a place in Phoenix called Ed Debevicks (I believe)... it was a 50's New York diner-style experience, complete with waiters and waitresses that would strive to exceed each other in the ways that they could be outrageously, hilariously, rude.  They'd shove you over so they could sit down while they took your order.  They'd loudly chew gum and take a sip of your drink.  They might call you names, they'd for sure snort and roll their eyes, but at the end of the day it was all a joke.  As they were putting on the act, they were covertly on the BALL with your order, with a new drink and refills, with getting your order correct and hot and on your table quickly.  

Oreganos?  Well... they're rude.  Aaaand... that's it.

Good for groups: No
Good when you need to catch a movie: No
Good for work lunch (you have to be done in a reasonable time frame): No

I tried to order Alfredo the Dark with one modification:  Nope. Can't do it.  Okay, that's fair.

I tried to order the Lady is a Scampi: our server said \"It's spicy and we won't take it back if it's too spicy\".  Well, I like to put sriracha sauce on my pizza, and I order my wings \"Hot\" wherever I go, but she was so severe, I was worried about dropping $15 and going hungry for the rest of my work day. 

I have ordered a Julius Cesar salad with chicken (huge), which was good, but I've had better.

I have ordered the Zany Ziti, and found it unbearably bland.  And I do believe pasta and pizza is like sex... even when it isn't the BEST you've ever had... well, I'm not going to complain.   But... really, really BLAND.  I thought, like some pastas, that it just needed a day to sort of meld the flavors, so I looked forward to having it as a leftover the next day, but it came in a breadbowl, which then rendered it inedible as a leftover the next day. 

I've had the thin crust pizza, which was fine.  I mean... *straining to say something nice* ...yeah.  It was ...fine.

So, kids, as much as I struggle emotionally with leaving a 2-star review... that's been my experience after three visits - and next year for my co-worker's anniversary, I'll wish her well and then probably head up Gilbert Road to Joe's BBQ."}
{"text":"I  must confess ,  I play pretend.Sometimes at restaurants I pretend that I am really eating in a one of a kind local joint that only those in the know frequent. That's how I feel at Oreganos.  I love that it has that it has a kitschy air about it,I love the use of suprisingly tasty ingredients , I love that I can bring young or old family members and everybody is happy. 
Oreganos rarely dissapoints and on this past Sunday , mi familia was quite satisified with our food and drinks, and the fast service.  So kudos to Oreganos making my afternoon tasty as well as as easy."}
{"text":"My daughter loves to come here on her birthday. This year she turned 10, and all the staff, especially our waiter, treated her like a million dollars. It made her day!"}
{"text":"After a disappointing start to our Memorial Day at another Goodyear restaurant, my girlfriend and I ended up at the furthest west Oregano's that I know. In fact, we started our meal by counting the number of Oregano's that we have each been to, from Tucson to Flagstaff. And then we ate!

We started with one of my girlfriend's recommendations, the Lawrence Shrooms. Holy fungus! This appetizer included two large, over-stuffed mushroom caps featuring sausage, cheese, tomatoes and more. My mushroom cap was larger than your typical pot pie. Joining our appetizer, we each enjoyed a delicious adult beverage. The Hi-Fi Root Beer is just as good as it sounds!

Rather than splitting a pizza (the selection is awesome) we decided to share a pasta dish featuring grilled sausage and peppers with an order of cheesy garlic bread. This was more than enough for us to handle and leftovers remained. Lots of delicious leftovers!

Finally, our server Anna was very helpful, efficient and prompt. The service and the consistently good food, plus the variety, is the reason we love dining at Oregano's!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed several meals at Oreganos Pizza Bistro from Tucson to Flagstaff. I've also eaten lunch and dinner at locations from the west valley to the east side. The five stars given here are not just for the quality of the menu options, but also for the consistency exemplified across the chain.

My favorite location has to be the one in Scottsdale. No matter the time of year, the patio is an awesome place to hang out. Plus it was here that I discovered a very unique pizza on their menu. It was so good, I took both of my sons to dinner tonight to share it with them.

The wait time of 30 minutes wasn't as bad as I expected. It is a Saturday night after all, but we didn't arrive until about 7. We were shown our table on time and our server (I think her name was Briana) was excellent. As was the staff that cleared items during the meal.

Before the pizzas arrived, I suggested the calamari appetizer. My oldest didn't argue the choice. My youngest wasn't sure cause he'd never tried it before. Now, he loves calamari! Oreganos doesn't use the more common rings. The breaded and fried calamari steak strips were perfectly cooked. They were tender and the portion was perfect for the three of us to share.

We ordered two 16\" pizzas for dinner. The first was the Grandma G's which starts with pesto sauce and adds garlic chicken, carmelized onions, Roma tomatoes, mozzarella, rosemary, and thinly sliced potatoes. The toppings may be odd, but they blend together so well! My oldest son declared \"this is my new favorite pizza!\"

The boys put their heads together and selected the Yahoo Barbecue Chicken Pizza. It was equally as good! We all enjoyed this pizza because the BBQ sauce was amazingly good for an Italian restaurant. I also liked the chicken and red onions, although my youngest picked them off.

I cannot believe this is my 100th Yelp! I'm glad I could share this occasion with both of my sons. Oreganos consistently impresses me. Thank you for making an impression on my sons as well!"}
{"text":"This isn't my first review of an Oregano's. Probably won't be my last either. I had to write something more than a check in because a lot of the people in my circle have been dining at Oregano's lately. And it was a special occasion.

My oldest son turned 20 this past week. I suggested we go out for dinner and God bless him, he chose Oregano's. My son has good taste. Also, I had just dined at the Oregano's near where I live, the night before. Regardless, I knew this would be an awesome time.

Then he chose the Calamari appetizer. More good taste demonstrated. It was as delicious as always! I even let him choose our pizza. He suggested a thin crust Clark Street Meat Pizza. All I could think was \"this is definitely my son\". We ordered a large 18\" pizza and destroyed most of it. I've never selected this one before, but always wanted to. The spicy sausage is outstanding! But so is the capicolla, the salami, the garlic, and all that jazz.

Of course, hanging out with my son made this experience  fun. But not to be forgotten, our waitress Cassie was amazing! She was busy, but she was always nearby and checked in often. Beverages were taken care of, the food was delivered quickly, and she made the meal more enjoyable with just her personality. Ask for Cassie!

Oregano's is known for their food. And I've always enjoyed that. What they also deserve to be recognized for is their consistency and service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We love Oregano's! The pasta is good. The portions are good size. And if you're into chicken wings - their wings are meaty and good! 
My personal favorite is the Zany Ziti, though I have also ordered the Lady is a Scampi. It's spicy, but also very good. 
The service is good. Food is consistently good. And the tshirts are funny!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Oregano's. The pizza is great. One of the better pizzas I have had. I visited this Oregano's twice while I stayed in Mesa in January. 

I highly recommend the bistro classic pizza, the pesto penne bake and the  pizza cookie for dessert.

I had to wait 45 minutes for a table on one of my visits. It is closer to the university so very busy."}

Service was god and I did not have to wait for a table at this location. Both visits were after 8 PM."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant and our absolute go-to for dinner or lunch. Everything on the menu is great and the price is amazing. You get so much food for what you pay. The only thing I dislike is the wait time. It's always sooo packed but that just means it must be good. I love Oregano's!"}
{"text":"I've been to Oregano's a half dozen times in the last year and have had some mixed results, hence the 3 stars.

 Two weeks ago I took a buddy of mine from out out town. We started off with the Guaca Tony, which is an Italian guacamole, made with basil, roasted garlic and avocado, surrounded with pizza crust 'chips. They give you a heaping mound of Guacamole, but the pizza crust tasted like pure salt, which definitely ruined that appetizer. We shared a pizza which was definitely way too salty as well.

I don't know if the cook accidently knocked over a large shaker of salt in the pizza batter and didn't want to get fired by management for throwing the profits in the garbage. But this was the first time I didn't enjoy my meal at Oregano's.

The staff is ALWAYS uber friendly and helpful. But a major downer for me is the lack of adequate facilities based on the size of the restaurant which means you need to plan well and be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I loved the fact that I could get put on the wait list through Yelp's App- very easy and convenient.  The food was wonderful and the service was excellent:)"}
{"text":"Why is it that to go orders are always messed up?  And...am I the only person on earth that notices the error in the order after you've driven to the restaurant, picked up the order, paid for the order (and tipped accordingly), got back home, opened the bag, get excited because you ordered exactly what you were in the mood to eat... only to notice something's missing?  Tonight, my husband and I were in the mood for our favorite salad, the Antipasto Thing.  Got it home, started eating it and both of us noticed at the same time....NO CHEESE WAS ON THE SALAD!  Totally ruined my dinner!  So disappointed! And since my husband was hungry and refused to call them to complain because he WAS NOT going to drive back to exchange the salad...my option was to complain about the salad on yelp.  And in my defense about checking the order before you leave the restaurant....we only ordered 1 salad and who would have thought to verify all of the ingredients were on the SALAD? Grrrrrrrrr"}
{"text":"Come for the atmosphere, stay for the good food and friendly staff. This is a REAL Italian restaurant, portions are big and everything we have tried has been very flavorful. It's not fancy but great for the whole family. Which we prefer. Nothing seems overpriced like some Italian places. I recommend to just walk and try a bowl of pasta with meatballs and garlic bread. If that doesn't make you feel warm inside then you need some help."}
{"text":"Eating with my Sis appetizer are good bread with garlic and cheese good, artichoke - Spinach with bread so good A plus , sweet potatoes, Picasso jr salad so good, pesto pasta so good and slice of veggie pizza really love this place try it if you are in Mesa  Arizona"}
{"text":"It seems like I must not have gone to the restaurant all the other reviewers experienced.  We went to Oregano's in Scottsdale for an office lunch.  There were about 10 of us.  BIG mistake.

We ordered.   We talked.  We drank our sodas.  We waited.  We talked. We drank more sodas.  But mostly, we waited.... and waited... and waited.  

After an hour and a half and NO FOOD, half of our party left while the others continued to.... yep, you guessed it... wait.

Was the food good?  I didn't like it.  But then again, when it arrived at my office desk in a carry out box two hours after I ordered it, perhaps I just wasn't in the mood anymore.

One Star.  Sorry, but they earned it."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza.  Great service and their pizza cookie with ice cream is awesome. The pan pizza takes 45 minutes or so to cook so if that's your thing be sure to call and order ahead! :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I literally vomited from the pizza (I kid you not). I've had pizzas throughout the country over 40 years... This is by far the worst ever!!! Crust is exactly like soggy cardboard. Taste is nasty too! I love olive oil but they take it to an extreme! For the cost of this mass-produced garbage, they don't put on much topings either. Asked the server to take it back 'cause the crust was raw, uncooked, soggy to the point it was falling apart... All they did was heat it some more and bring me the same garbage back! To top off the insult, they'll make you wait an hour for it too! Staff frequently ignore customers. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Food and service were both very good. Lots of food! My only complaint was one waitress/ hostess needed to wear a bra. No one wants to see that while being waited on!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why my family is so obsessed with this place. Maybe I'm an unfair judge because I have a deep hatred for pizza. 

They do have a few pasta dishes that I enjoy and they do taste good but not good enough to outweigh the cons of this restaurant. I can deal with a long wait if the food tastes great and the atmosphere is nice. While the food does pass...the atmosphere just ugh...

It's SO crowded. There's like four tables inside. However they have ample OUTSIDE seating. Um...

Do they not realize this is Arizona? There are only about two months out of the year where outside seating is a comfortable choice. Also, the parking is horrible. You're lucky to get a spot in their tiny lot.

Since they're always so crowded the service is really slow too. It sucks because their food is pretty tasty. Oh well."}
{"text":"Really, really good food for a very reasonable price, especially given the portion sizes.  Great patio and ambiance.  

I am from out of town and would most definitely recommend this place.  

If I had a complaint, the wait times are long and they don't serve Crown Royal."}
{"text":"The delivered Pizza was not like what was pictured on Yelp, or as I had at the location downtown. The pepperoni and mushrooms were on top of the sauce and completely covered by cheese, instead of on top of the cheese, so the pepperoni was soggy, not crispy. Somewhere in the mush was an excessive amount of oregano. I would have sent this back if it hadn't been delivered. It was awful. I will never eat at this location again."}
{"text":"Not to shabby the pizza was under cook for my tasting but service was excellent. I want to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Go hungry! I've been to Oregano's twice now, and was served good, hearty Italian food. This place is great for groups of four or more, since almost everything is served family style. 

The garlic bread appetizer (with cheese and marinara dipping sauce, of course) was a meal in itself! The Numero One salald offers a nice Mediterranean flare, and was tasty, but the lettuce didn't look really fresh. The pizza here was also good. Moving here from Chicago, they have a VERY thin \"thin crust\" that's cut in a waffle pattern, bringing a touch of the Windy City to the Valley. There is also deep dish and stuffed pizza listed on the menu, but haven't tried those for authenticity.... Haha. 

It you desire good family style dinners on an empty stomach, you've found a good place."}
{"text":"OK, not great. Our selections were uninspired and a big off the mark in flavor profile. We ordered the Alfredo the dark which was decent at best. Lady is a scampi which was drenched in oil and a bit excessive in spice. The sweet potato fries were smothered in Cinnamon not good. Admittedly I'm a NY pizza person not chicago so I stayed away from that. Long wait for food so get comfortable, but environment is nice"}
{"text":"Very slow service. Sat for 15mins before even being asked if we wanted a water. I had heard this place was slow and poor service from several others, but since it was not busy and we came in after the rush, I was expecting better service.

Once the server came around, he did a fine job. Refilled our waters, etc.

Food came out in decent amount of time.

We had pizza & wings. The pizza was just \"ok\". Many other better pizza joints in the area. Barros, Rosatis, Rays, Uncle Louie, Pizzafarros; all blow this place away. Barros being my local favorite.

The wings were the smallest I've ever had. Literally. I wish I would have snapped a picture. Some were seriously 1/2 the size of my pinky finger. I have never seen such small wings. Very, very poor quality. Again, all of the other places selling wings put this place to shame. Flavor was good, just the wings were about 1/4 of the size of standard wing. My wife and I order pizza/wings once a week so I have a pretty good idea of what other pizza joints are serving up. 

The pizza for what it is, is overpriced. Large pizza and wings was $40 not including tip.

Save your money; save your time and go to one of the many other great pizza joints in our great town of Cave Creek!

First time and last time customer at this location."}
{"text":"Saw the cook eat off my, and the guests next to mines plate. Without gloves. Canceled order, have not been back."}
{"text":"I realized I have just been leaving reviews for places that were horrible and thought I should change that.  Oregano's is consistently good!  Key word CONSISTENTLY!  They are always busy but turn tables quickly.  Service is always friendly , food is always good, cookie is always worth fighting over!!"}
{"text":"Noisy and just ok food. Oven alarms going off, jazz music. Not my thing. Pizza overcooked but Pablo pacaso salad was good."}
{"text":"This is a place I miss terribly ever since I moved away. I go at least three times during my week-long vacays back to Scottsdale, and I always order the exact same thing: Pablo Picasso salad, hold the cilantro, and a Pizzookie (chocolate chip, of course). 

I've tried the pizza, the sandwiches, all of the apps, but these are the only two things that have me coming back. The dressing on the Picasso salad tastes like a delicious Mexican party in your mouth, and the salad itself has so many wonderful ingredients, including a very delicious, slightly spicy fajita chicken. There are FOUR different kinds of cheeses in here, and tomatoes, and chips. I. Love. This. Salad.

HOWEVER, I love pretty much nothing more in this universe (sorry, bf!) than the amazingness that is the pizzookie. I often dream about it, and wish I could replicate it in my own kitchen. Even other restaurants fail at making this dish perfect (I'm looking at you, BJ's and Boulders!). Oregano's excels and makes you want to eat this every day. I can never finish a whole one (and when I do, I feel sick but in the most satisfying way), so I usually share. I get pretty greedy and territorial, though, so watch out.

The service here is always very friendly and nice, and many of the male servers are very attractive (that's a nice bonus!). Prices are definitely on the cheaper side, and they have some new-ish options of making your salad a 'Junior' size for a few bucks less, and it's STILL a ton of food.

Bottom line, you have to try the Pizzookie. You may hate me later for the weight I made you gain from becoming addicted, but during those orgasmic moments when the warm, melty cookie is in your mouth, you'll be thanking me."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times while I was here at Tempe as a student. Their pastas are really good. My personal favourites are The Big Rig Pasta and Alfredo the Dark... The quantity that they serve is very generous for the money that we pay. The pizzas that they serve too are very good and is the best in town. But the pizzas take quite long to be served. 

Overall a very good place to have some authentic Italian Food."}
{"text":"I have visited his Bistro many times and have never been disappointed. The atmosphere and the servers have always been professional, helpful and they have a great laid back attitude. Our best experience has been with a server named Tim. His personality was over the top and made for a fabulous visit. On this last visit we had the stuffed mushroom appy which was great! I opted for a dinner salad with chicken and the sweet serrano dressing which I love. My friend had the margherita pizza and there were no complaints. We sat and chatted for quite a long time and never felt hurried by the staff to turn the table. One of my favorite places to go for great food with friends."}
{"text":"Honestly the service was mediocre but the deep dish pizza and the Picasso salad were AMAZING! For just two people my girlfriend and I only spent $24 and we were definitely stuffed afterwords. I love oreganos and can't wait to try more of their salads and pastas.  Btw the pizzokie is the REAL deal !"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for months for this location to open.  Went the day after opening, waited about 10mins for a table. Servers very friendly, food was delicious.   They seems to open this new franchise pretty smoothly.  Only down side is the parking in this complex...had to park a ways away from the restaurant do to competition from the bar close by."}
{"text":"Same Oregano's food that you know and love - but finally a location with ample parking.  My last visit was also the first time my group didn't have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Been getting wings, pizza and garlic bread for a long time, from this local and others. They used to have really great wings, but they have dropped in quality recently. First, they dropped the count on a wing order from like 14 to 10. More importantly, the quality of the wings went from plump, full-size wings that were outstanding, to scrawny ones that all but disappear when dropped in the fryer. 

I'm not sure which accounting pinhead comes in and makes these decisions, but if you\"'re listening, I would happily pay a dollar or two more to keep getting the same great order of wings  Stop cutting costs with subpar food. 

The pizza and garlic bread are always solid. We are likely to find a new place for wings after the change, since it's no longer worth the drive."}
{"text":"They have a winning combination; good food, great atmosphere, large portions and very reasonable prices. Always consistent.
Tip: try their deep dish pizzas, they are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza! The sauce has a great flavor, reminds me of being home in Chicago.  While we waited for our to go order, we enjoyed an ice cold beer from the bar.  Cool bartenders and waitresses, nice vibe in this place.  They even gave us a couple free slices while we waited, can't beat that.   Next time I'm definately eating in, place was great!"}
{"text":"only redeeming quality was how sweet our waitress was. she was knowledgable about the menu and very friendly. she got our appetizers out timely. However i dont understand how it takes 45 minutes to get a sandwich and a salad on the table is beyond me. The restaraunt was not very busy. i was on my lunch break and did not have time go eat my food. Do not come here unless you plan on dieing here because you will spend your life here."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to many Oregano's and this was the far best! Annie was our server. She gave us excellent service. Never waited for water refills, our salad main dish and dessert came in the exact order and she came by to ask how the food was, very kind. If you stop by, ask for Annie and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's and I have frequented this location for years. Their food is consistently wonderful with large portions and amazing drinks. The servers are always prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at this restaurant.  I typically get the deep dish pizza. When I want to splurge, I get a Bellini.  The look great and taste better.  This location is typically very busy so be prepared to wait a few minutes. I try to sit at the bar since there is no wait if there is a chair available."}
{"text":"We have been to Oregano's in the past at other locations and have always been happy so we were excited that one was opening up in Surprise. We went on a Sunday afternoon and were seated immediately because we chose to sit on the patio. The patio was nice, but I think there was only one waitress for the entire patio which means we waited a while before we could order drinks. Also, there were a lot of flies on the patio. The waitress was nice and we were ready to order once she got to us. It took about 40 minutes to get our food after ordering, but my daughter ordered a calzone which we didn't realize takes longer to cook. I got the meatball sub. It was only ok. There wasn't much sauce on it at all so I used the cup of sauce that came with my daughters calzone to help with the dryness factor. I liked the coleslaw that came with the sandwich. The fries were good. My husband got the stuffed Italian sub. He liked it, but he asked for the giardiniera on it and they forgot it. He got the sweet potato fries which have cinnamon on them - they are delicious. My daughter liked the O'zone calzone. Drinks took a little long to fill and service was a bit slow. So far, I'm disappointed. I was expecting a better experience from Oregano's."}
{"text":"I love thin crust pizza and they make the best with great fresh ingredients, I also am a big fan of their meatballs. I never had any problems with their service. The only thing I do not thoroughly enjoy is their music, and it's loud. They crank up the Frank Sinatra and for me that can be a little annoying."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. I guess I got it confused with Oregano's Wood Fire Pizza that I had back home in Los Altos, CA. The food portions are unusually big (my friend got a junior sized salad that was probably as big as our pasta portion!) The penne pasta bake looked good. Bollo pasta was all you can eat, but my friend couldn't eat even one bowl. Three of us got the 6 inch ravioli and they weren't kidding about the size. It was good, but sooo big that I just kind of got sick from all the pasta and cheese after eating about half. I ended up eating about 3/4 of it. Their menus are just as big as their food portions, it was like 3 feet by 3 feet once you unfolded it!"}
{"text":"I just love the local eateries and tend to stay away from the chain places. I came for a graduation and this place was recommended by the graduate. His day his place to eat. I enjoyed the outdoor seating area as its was heated. The pizza was great, as well as the appetizers. Jim our waiter was most accommodating. I'll be back the next time I get to town."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Thought it looked a bit chain-y from the outside, and I realize that it is a growing regional chain, but the food and service felt more like a local place than an Olive Garden or something like that. 

Fantastic service (server who wasn't afraid to offer definitive recommendations when we asked about various items) who was also good with our kid. We split a couple of entrees (not pizza) that were both great, too - was just going to look up the menu to remind myself what it was, but the website appears to be down...

Decor was a bit kitschy - but gave you something to do while waiting for food - \"is that a penguin up there?\" kinds of conversations - especially helpful with a kid who's hungry!"}
{"text":"Sadly, we called ahead to place an order for pick up (it was a girl who took our order) and once we got there, the take out gal was very disrespectful and aggressive in the fact that we \"were wrong\" and supposedly we didn't call ahead with an order. She then suggests that someone else \"must not have written down the order\". This was last night 1/17/2018 at roughly 8pm. Thus, we showed her the conversation history on my call log and she couldn't deny it at that point. So, we placed the order again and waited 20 minutes in the lobby. The whole time we were there she was the only girl working 'take out' so we knew it was her that didn't want to take responsibility which is frustrating. Moreover, she was frantically counting her cash at the register and tip jar the whole time. Finally, once we got our food, she didn't give us any utensils, napkins or the side for a dish. This was such a bad experience and very sad since I've been going to the other Oreganos locations for nearly 10 years without ever having any issues. This was my first and last time and this location. I would give this review negative stars if possible because of that girl."}
{"text":"Awesome food ALWAYS! They have delivered GREAT service and wonderful ambient consistently.  Always a great time!"}
{"text":"So, we had good moments and bad.  

For the good - It only took 10 minutes for them to seat us and not 25 like they told us.  Half of our order came out as we wanted.

For the bad - This was not a great night for Oregano's for me,  For some reason they chose not to punch in my order and therefore did not make my order.  I mentioned this to the wait person twice before she caught on that I did not receive my food.  They offered to make it but by the time it would have come out everyone would have been done so I declined. Someone else in the group ordered the steamed broccoli and it came drenched in butter (that did not agree with their diet).  

The girls got a pizza and were very happy with it.  

To make up for things they brought out one of their cookies and took a little off the check.  We had several managers come by and apologize for the wait's mistake.  What kind of upset me was the wait did not apologize until we paid for the meal and were walking out the door.  I would have thought she would have been the first one to apologize."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place! I'm not as much of a fan... I like traditional Italian more than the Italian/Mexican combo that Oreganos does. Their salads are really good - I just wish the pasta was a bit less Mexican and a bit more Italian. Also, I'm not a fan of the angel hair pasta that's used in a lot of dishes."}
{"text":"I have yet to be truly disappointed after eating at Oregano's.  I've experienced iffy service at the Mesa location, but the Camelback location has always been great.  I've always had to wait, but that's only given me the opportunity to enjoy a tasty, tasty Bellini in the meantime (damn you, Oregano's, for your two-Bellini cap!).  Service is friendly, the food is consistently good, and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed.  Please note that if you are dining with a group, the entire group must be present before you are seated.

I have only two complaints about this location:

!. Parking sucks
2. The floors are VERY slippery. Beware if you're wearing heels or shoes with slick soles so you don't fall like I did.

Let's end on a high note, shall we?

1. You know how I feel about the Bellinis.
2. Big Rig Pasta + chicken + hot wings sauce = YUM
3. I'll only share a pizza cookie with you if I really, really like you. Otherwise, that sucker's all mine!

I heart you, Oregano's!"}
{"text":"After a day of shopping, we tried Oregano's and were very glad we did!

Our server was super friendly and efficient, plus she knew the menu!

Atmosphere had a good vibe with an assortment of music, and lots of neat design features. 

We split a chicken Parmesan sandwich ($10) that was excellent: crispy chicken in a crusty bread, with savory marinara sauce and melted cheese. Accompanied by very good waffle fries and a unique olive & chipotle coleslaw. It was all very good and plenty for two.

Wine was only $5 a glass - and they actually listed the bar prices on the menu (what a concept)!

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have never had to wait for a table at this location and the service is always great. The first time I ate here I was so overwhelmed by the menu there are so many options and all of them sound great. This isn't an authentic Italian restaurant but I like how they make all the classic dishes with a twist . The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. The food here is pretty good try the Boom Dip as an appetizer and don't forget to leave room for the Pizookie its heavenly."}
{"text":"Pretty solid pizza offerings here.  Was in town to visit a friend and I heard about this place that served Chicago style pizza.  While it isn't as good as the Chitown joints I've been to, it's still cranks out a pretty good pizza pie.

The only drawback to ordering Chicago style pizza is that it takes so long to cook (it is a thick pie).  While there are other options on the menu (thin pizzas and pastas), I opted to wait for my thick and juicy pizza.  Overall it was pretty good and tasty and the service was decent, even though it was pretty slammed when we were there.

Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Went with a friend who's from Chicago and she's a fan. The host staff was really friendly and competent, doing everything to get us seated quickly.  The place was packed, Saturday afternoon about 1P. We had a genial server Jesus who was there promptly, efficient with the orders and attentive to the drinks refills. I had no been there before and was astounded at the size of the portions. The salads, pies and pasta dishes are huge. I noticed the kiddies get a blob of dough to snack on and play with depending on their ages. We got the warm artichoke dip which was very good and the dipping strips were tasty, possibly a little too much cheese along with the dip, but good. We had a deep-dish that was really good  - slices were much the size of what one gets for a lasagne. Topped with sausage, peppers, pepperoni and mushrooms. Definitely get enough to take home and enjoy again. Every table around us ordered some dessert, apparently quite popular but we were stuffed. I found it pleasant, albeit loud, and people seemed to be really happy dining there. Bar was filled and you can dine there too.  Good experience."}
{"text":"Even though I live nearby, this was my first visit. Wife and I have tried Oregano's at another location before. So when this place was built, we weren't to excited. We just didn't think their food was that good.
However, after a dentist visit and my mouth all numbed up. Remember to eat very carefully when mouth is numbed! I was hungry, so I decided to give this place a chance. 
I ordered off the menu, and they had no problem with it. I had angel hair pasta, with the pesto and garlic butter sauce, sausage(sliced), and peppers. This is one of my favorite dish I order every time we go out for a meal.
Well, Oregano's did a great job. Not my favorite, however it's up there. Portion is large, and yes I finished it. Meal comes with a garlic bread, and it was very good. The sausage was good, sauce was awesome, and the meal over all was great. The service wasn't that great, had to return the first dish since the server forgot to mentioned to the kitchen that I wanted angel hair.(Reason for a 4-star) Next time I will bring the wife, and hopefully she'll give them a second chance also."}
{"text":"Since our daughter moved to Tempe, wife and I will take the hour drive to see her once in awhile! So, the wife, our two foster daughters and I packed up and hauled to Tempe. One of the reason why I moved out of SoCal, was traffic. One of the reason why I hate Tempe, is traffic. Anyway, the main reason why we took the trip. So our daughter could meet the foster kids for the first time. 
We have been wanting to try Oregano's, so we decided to try this location out. One thing I have noticed since we have had our foster kid's are trying to find a place where they like the food. They are not use to restaurants, they love fast foods. So we were seated, ordered our drinks quickly, and a cheese bread appetizer. Their cheese bread was amazing if you like garlic! Our six yr old had the kids meal cheese pizza, our seven yr old was the tough one. She was acting like she didn't want to eat there. Knowing that she like spicy food, I ordered hot wings and a large pepperoni pizza half with jalapenos. Our daughter had the chicken Parmesan, and wife had the penne pesto. I can tell the six year old enjoyed the food, WHY! She ate her whole personal pizza, had two hot wings,sampled the wife's penne, and daughters parmesan!  The seven year old did like the pizza, and hot wings. I myself thought the food was good. I did request the pizza to be well done, like the crust crispy. However the waiter advised not to since their crust is extra thin and will burn the crust. After getting the pizza, wished they would have cooked it longer. 
We had a great time, the girls loved our daughter, food was good. Now for the cons! We felt the waiter was rushing us through out our time there? We were not ever half way done with our food and he was already asking us about dessert, and boxes for our food? And prices, I,m OK with shelling out hundred dollars for dinner. This place just doesn't seem to be a place I would enjoy spending that kind of money. This is why I almost gave this place a 3-star review. But the overall experience we had, was well worth it. We had fun, girls enjoyed the dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is always on point! They never fail to disappoint with their amazing pizza, pasta and not to mention their pizookie!"}
{"text":"I love the vibe of Oregano's, almost as much as I love the gilbbilni bellinis (but sip slowly).  My husband is a big fan of spicy foods so he always gets the diablo ship pasta and my favorite dish is the pesto penne bake (no meat added).  The portions are pretty big so bring your appetite, a buddy, or get a box to eat your leftovers for the next lunch & dinner.  If you really want to go full-force on the pig out scale, I recommend the guaca-tony appetizer as well.

The staff is always super friendly, but it does get really busy for dinner.  Our tactic for Oregano's is to skip lunch then head to an early dinner at 4 to stuff our faces and miss the crowd.  Then you can roll yourself home with plenty of time to sit on the couch and talk about how full you are for the next three hours.

The parking is really easy and the place is easy to find.  If you have a group of more than 5 you might need to call or plan ahead if reservations are allowed.  The vibe is really fun and casual and the patio is the best place to sit when the weather won't melt you into your seat.

I bring all my out of state friends/family to Oregano's when they come to visit.  :)"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is a good choice... Everything! The only downfall is the seating, we visited with a large party and had to be seated at different tables around the restaurant"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were thinking about what restaurants we have never been disappointed by. Oreganos is hands down number 1!!!! The food is always the best we've ever had and the staff is on it! Never had an order messed up and never had a bad time. Loveeeee this place!!"}
{"text":"Great food but wait time and service was ridiculous. Waited 4 hours total for wait and food all together."}
{"text":"If I could I will give this place a zero. I have been a long time customer since the wings were 13 BIG WINGS, then 10 big wings and now 10 small wings... always for the same price. 
I ve always gotten the bbq deep dish since forever. This is the only pizza, I get from Oregano's because is that good! I like this pizza so much that even once after waiting for 45 minutes I went to te restaurant to pick it up and it was  never processed and guess what? I waited another 45 minutes for my pizza!
Today May 30th, 2018 I decided to treat some business associates to one of my favorite pizzas.. and what a disappointment. 
Everything went wrong from the very beginning. I called to place my order and The lady that picked up the phone was rude to say the least, when I asked her for her name. She asked me to wait and put a male employee on the phone. I explained to the male employee the reason why I wanted a name because my order got missed before and ever since I always ask for a name to have as a reference, he kindly gave me his.
As I said before I ve always gotten the same pizza and I know it takes 45 minutes to cook, I have even order this pizza for New Years dinner and I have never waited more than 50 minutes. The female employee told me to wait 1 hour and 30 minutes.
Strange, but I assumed they were busy. Once I got to the restaurant that was not the case. The entire outside sitting area was empty, parking lot not even at a third of capacity and just a couple of tables inside were occupied.
I am still trying to be positive and over come the wait time, the rudeness and the fact that I have to explain myself so much, I was focusing on my goal of offering my associates a great meal.
One hour 30 minutes later around 1pm I show up in the restaurant to pick up my pizza and the cashier shows me a pizza drowned in bbq sauce that has nothing to do with the pizza I am used to getting. It was like if they had forgotten to add the chicken,onions and tomatoes and cheese that are always visible on the top. I mentioned to the cashier that the pizza looked different and told me thats the bbq chicken pizza: While she is handing me the box she says:\"oh, your pizza is not cut, is that okay?\" And I just looked at her and I told her :\"it's a pizza...could you please cut it?\" She rolled her eyes at me and she went to the kitchen, came back a few minutes later with the pizza cut very sloppy. 
Then it came to the bill part. The difference btw my normal bill for the same order and the one for today was around $20. My total bill today for a 12\" bbq chicken pan pizza and an order of wings was $51.46 I have never paid that much! 
I feel disrespected, mistreated, poorly served, embarrassed, overcharged and overall disappointed. 
This used to be a great place with great food and great service. Somewhere down the line it all went completely wrong.
I will not recommend again!"}
{"text":"I really like this place every time I come here. Never a wait and good service. The portions are unreal so bring your appetite. The pizzas are great and the baked pastas are so good. Looking forward to the next time."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to this restaurant on Bell Road and sitting at the bar there is a bartender Kinzer Who is very attentive always smiling and always make my dining experience a pleasurable one. Kinzer also Waits on tables so if the bar is full we will find a table for you. Tell him Gary sent you!"}
{"text":"I've got to give Oregano's credit, the food was significantly better than I was expecting.  I've long avoided this restaurant as given it's popularity, it is always slammed with customers.   I figured that while the food was probably good, it wasn't THAT good.   We did arrive early (around 4:00 PM) to get our name in the hat and ended up enjoying a two hour wait.  In fairness to Oregano's, we were a party of 13 and they couldn't seat us until at least half the group had arrived.  No one objected to that and in this instance, I didn't mind the wait.   

The outside staff was courteous and it was nice to get full drink service while we were out there.   Their beers on tap aren't outstanding, though they do have some microbrew stuff as well as the typical range of garbage beers and slightly less garbage beers so at least the liquor was drinkable.  I couldn't get a Bloody Mary though because they were \"out of Bloody Mary Mix\" (note to self, never order a Bloody Mary at Oregano's).   The free pizza samples were quite nice as well.   

From the time we finally did get seated, to getting our food, to paying our bill, was two and half hours so in all our large group ended up spending around 4 1/2 hours at the restaurant with long waits to be seated and a long wait between ordering our food and getting our food.  

Was it worth it? Ahh, the million dollar question.   As I said in the beginning of the review, I was overall pretty surprised by the quality of the food.  It was quite delicious.  I ordered an alfredo dish with shredded chicken and it was very good.  The sauce had a strong flavor without being overwhelming and Oregano's use of southwest peppers wins a gold star from me.   They get a little carried away with the herbs (to much Oregano? yes!) which gives some of the food a gritty aftertaste but overall it was excellent.   

I also decided to order a full-size pizza to take home with me.  After waiting four hours, I figured it wasn't going to be anytime soon that I would venture these crowds again.  The pizza, a southwestern creation with carne asade and more poblanos was also quite good.  I love thin crust pizza so for me they have a real winner here with their basic design.   Again the use of herbs was somewhat overpowering but the taste of the pizza was fairly rock solid.   The larger pizzas are only $1-$2 more expensive than the small pizzas (though the pizzas themselves are fairly expensive overall) so after going with an 18'' I ended up with enough food to get me through the next several days.  I was quite happy about that.

Overall the experience was very positive but it was mainly made so by having a great group of friends to hang with.  Going in we knew the wait was going to be long (especially because of the size of our party) so we took it in stride and tried to enjoy the atmosphere.   The food was definitely good and the service was decent but the food was not good enough that I would be willing to brave the wait times on a regular basis.  I'm fairly sure Oregano's will go on the list of (very) infrequent special occasions.      I strongly recommend you avoid the restaraunt if you are looking for something small or intimate.   

Part of the issue with this location is that they built in an old fast food joint (long-time residents of the area will recognize it as the building that used to house a Fazolli's) and the building simply isn't large enough for the crowds the food draws.  That's a shame because the restaurant easily draws enough business to support a larger building and larger staff.   Oregano's, I love you but either open more West Side locations or relocate to a larger building, until then you won't be seeing me regularly.

Though, with the business they draw, they won't be missing my money either.   Ahh well, at least the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Crispy, thin crust pizza was great! Very good wine selections. Fabulous atmosphere and food! Anthony was 'the bomb'!"}
{"text":"I have been to Oregano's restaurants many times and the food is consistently delicious. Generally speaking, I recommend this chain. You can count on great food (and usually a long wait), which speaks for itself.

This review is particularly for this location at lunch time. We had a party of 7 people and were told it would be a 25 minute wait unless we sat on the patio. The inside of this one seems particularly small, since we arrived right at 11:30 and it didn't seem that busy. 

1) Initial acknowledgement and drink orders taken/delivered in a timely manner. They did well, but the waitress informed us that she was also tending bar.

2) Order taken promptly. We had to wait a few minutes, but not too long.

3) Food delivered in a reasonable timeframe. NO WAY - 20 minutes for salads and 40 for food. I had to get up and ask about the food as we were neglected during this time. Salads arrived warm.

4) Once food delivered, server checks back within a couple minutes to ensure everything is correct and you don't need anything. FAIL

5) Order was correct - Yes

6) Check brought quickly once meal is complete and payment processed and returned quickly. FAIL

7) Staff was friendly - Yes

8) Food quality - Great - I had a salad which was tasty.

9) Value - large portions and good value especially if you stick to the lunch menu.

Having someone tend bar and serve tables at the same time reflects poor management. Even though I complained about the time, my concerns were not addressed by management. It took an hour and 45 minutes for our lunch. This is not acceptable. We should not have been offered the patio if they do not have the staff available to provide decent service."}
{"text":"First visit and we'll return!  Garlic chicken was excellent and service was very good."}
{"text":"I eat here more then anywhere else in Arizona. It's my go-to when I've worked hard and want to eat mass quantities and enjoy myself. I usually get the large pan pizza. For some reason I find the pizza leftovers taste even better the 2nd day. Pasta and salads are delicious and plentiful. I put down a pretty ridiculous amount of food when I eat and this place never disappoints me. The Pizooki really is that good too."}
{"text":"Oregano's is one of the best Italian options in AZ and the Scottsdale location is no different.

The pastas are cooked well, the marinara is a bit spicy and has perfect chunks of tomato, and the pizza is perfect. I love the pesto pizza with sausage. SO GOOD.

They also make great drinks. The mojito at Oregano's is one of the best I've had. Really boozy and not too sweet.

Try the pizza cookie, even if you're too full. It's so worth it!"}
{"text":"This location was my worst Oregano's experience ever. I have been to several other valley locations over the years and have never been disappointed by the food or level of service provided. Being that this location is the newest, and also the consistency between other locations, I had high expectations for my experience here. 
First of all, the waitress that served our table did not seem well suited for her position. She seemed lost and overwhelmed the entire dinner, did not check in frequently enough to fill our drinks, and generally did not seem to understand the responsibilities of a waitress. 
As for the food, I was extremely disappointed. I love the pesto pizza and the Italian wedding soup and both were a major let down here. The pizza had hardly any pesto, which completely lacked flavor, and was smothered in way too much cheese. The soup was also greatly lacking in flavor as well as the meatballs. Overall, the food was tasteless and inconsistent with other oregano's locations. On top of this we had to wait over an hour to get our food with no explanation as we sat and waited. 
I will not be returning to this location nor will I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Guuuuud stuff. Best flat pies, awesome service, hot chocolate cookie for dessert. Delish! Salads are unreal. Their pizzas are never greasy or heavy..
Wont kill your carb count for the day.

A Scottsdale must stop! I do everytime im in town. Nice heated patio in the winter"}
{"text":"I know, it's a chain. But damnit sometimes you just like the food/drink at a chain restaurant. And ya know what, honesty is just more important sometimes than the pretentious -- i would NEVER even glance at a chain restaurant -- crap that I hear a lot of people spout. Don't get me wrong I'm a Local First girl. If given a choice I'll always go local...but every now and then you see something you like it and you give it a nod from time to time...

so anyways...guilt complex aside...this was one of the first restaurants i ate at when i arrived to phoenix. some co-workers were grabbing dinner there one weeknight after work and invited me to come. So I did. And I've been back once (fairly recently and for lunch) since.

Both times, I did the typical chain thing and ordered the same thing. The Pablo Picasso Salad. It's large. I mean huge doesn't even begin to describe it. But it's good. I order it with light cheese and dressing on the side. I also had a pizzookie here the first time I went...delish. I mean it's essentially partial-raw cookie dough...lightly baked in the oven (so it still retains the rawness to an extent) and ice cream on top. What is not to like!?

But in the name of full/shameful-disclosure...I will say my favorite thing about Oreganos are that they bring me a HUGE (again not suffice) glass of water and a HUGE glass of iced tea. 

Oreganos = chain, but good, large portions, big drinks...what else could any shameful-sporadically-consumerist-americana ask for?"}
{"text":"Won't ever return to this place again. I went for a birthday dinner and all I ordered was a chicken Cesar salad and I came home and got the worst food poisoning of my life. I was puking and shitting all night and I encourage everyone to never go to the place"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and salad selections....just keeps you coming back for more.  Love the chocolate cookies and ice cream dessert in a cast iron pan."}
{"text":"Rarely am I always pleased everytime I go to the same restaraunt-Oregano's gets it right every time.  This is one place that is the best Italian and Pizza you will ever have; the best locally owned eatery in Arizona. Nothing is bland, and you certainly taste the oregano in their pasta dishes.  If you don't mind the 30 minute time to cook it, their deep dish pizza is the best.. Other favorites are their anti-pasto salad (dinner size salad will feed 3 or 4 people, literally), Big Ole Ravioli, and of course, the famous Pizz-ookie dessert. Only complaint is every location is busy and there is usually a wait."}
{"text":"We had lunch yesterday at Oregano at this location because it's close to where we live. The guy that greeted us at the front was very friendly & took us to a table. The waitress was just as great, however the food was not great. We ordered our drinks first, my companion an iced tea & me a hot tea. I was given a tea bag & a cup of hot water. The water was not hot enough. It's just marginally warm enough as hot tea. Then I ordered the 'bowl of pasta' with 2 meatballs. I wanted spaghetti but they only serve angel hair & fettuccine noodles. When the food came, the noodles were ok, but there was not much tomatoes sauce on the noodles. The meatballs looked like they just came  out of the microwave oven & just lukewarm. They are not even browned. I had to ask the waitress to reheat them. My question is: how come they don't serve spaghetti (for the 'Bowl of Pasta' )? Spaghetti should be very common in Italian restaurants. Also the sauce is pretty spicy. Maybe they want to do a little differently  from the traditional Italian restaurants, but maybe we could have the option of 'not spicy' in the tomato sauce. Next time I'll stick with other traditional Italian restaurants !"}
{"text":"Once we were seated and received our drinks, we went to that place where the \"one hit wonders\" and secrets from civilizations have gone. Good things come to those who wait but 45 minutes is pushing it when it comes to a place that isn't that packed and we only ordered a 12 inch pie.Lost and forgotten!! The painful purgatory of pending pizza patrons paints perplexing pantomimes. The waitress could have at least checked up on us and/or given us some appetizers to temporarily satiate our belly banshees. Thankfully, Kristy, who may be a manager and wasn't even our original waitress, flew in to save the day. She offered us a free dessert on top of giving us a respectable discount. The food is always tip top, but today the service is what was truly shined!! Thanks Kristy!!"}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! My favorite is just the simple thin crust pepperoni pizza. If you go, you must get a pizza cookie! It's a must, believe me."}
{"text":"Jalen. Jalen. Jalen! What can I say about this guy? I understand it was a busy night, as I use to be in the service industry. At least check in with your guest. He was horrible! Didn't check in once with us until we flagged him down to refill our drinks, get a to go box and check. We even had to hand him our card to pay our bill because he didn't even pick it up. Unbelievable, he should not be working during the busy times. The food was good, but other then that, all downhill with our service. Definitely won't be coming back! :("}
{"text":"After my review I was contacted by the manager of the store who offered me her sincere apologizes and provided me with a $25 gift certificate to Oregano's, with the hopes that I would stop in again. I did use my certificate but this time I called again and took my food to-go. I am hopeful they implemented some sort of policy after this incident. I am grateful someone took the time to contact me and will continue to go to Oregano's but not at this location, unless it is for pick up."}
{"text":"One of my biggest peeves would be bad customer service. This place exceeds on bad customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, the only two bad things about this place are the parking and the wait. But with food this good, who cares??? 

I like to try something different most times and everything I've tried has been fantastic! Go with friends so you can try lots of things. 

Start with the KickBUTT Garlic Bread with cheese. I could just eat this! For salads, my favorite is the Vino Bambino...salad, pasta, beans, chicken, cheese, onions, red peppers. Just YUM! 

For the pasta, Pesto Penne Bake is at least two meals! It comes in a huge bread bowl that is so tasty itself. The Big Rig Pasta is also a huge hit. 

The different pizzas are also fantastic, but if you are going to go with a pizza-ish thing, go with the Ozone Calzone. So melty and cheesy and just so freaking good! 

Go with my favorite drink, the Bellini! A tasty frozen mix of champagne, peaches, raspberries and all sorts of other tasty stuff! They limit you to two, but it's worth it. Lucky I'm withing walking distance! 

YOU MUST YOU MUST YOU MUST!!! Finish your meal with their Pizza Cookie. You can choose chocolate chip, peanut butter or white chocolate macadamia nut. We usually get half peanut butter/half chocolate chip. Ooey, gooey, hot, ice creamy goodness!! 

The service is always fantastic as well! My friends and I had the displeasure of going last year once when their A/C was out. In July. Despite the fact that everyone was miserable, the staff still had great spirits and was right on the ball with everything. So much so that I felt the need to send in a positive letter about the staff despite us being miserable.

Go, eat, drink, LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"They have a great wait staff and the food is always delicious. However their bar needs a serious drain clean out. The fruit flies are atrocious!!!! They are so bad that sitting at the bar without one getting in your food or drink or your EYE is nearly impossible. I sat in The dining room during my next visit and still those suckers were in your face during the meal then too! I have been here a few time now and it seems they like their a/c because that thing is freezing you out every dinner. Management should fix the bug problem!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit to the Chandler Oregano's.  Both times service was great but food was A-OK.  Since pizza was their specialty we ordered a 10\" Chicago style deep dish pan pizza with sausage and portobella. Knowing it's a 30 minutes cook time we pace through the appetizer, salad & drinks but still had time to kill.  I browsed around and noticed other people only had thin crust pizza on tables.  I asked our waiter about this and he says no one wants to wait 30-45 min for pizza.  NO KIDDING!!!!  Then why not take customer's pan or stuff pizza orders when they are waiting for a table bc there's ALWAYS A WAIT?!?!?!  I know restaurants in Chicago do that.  Anyhow, by the time our pizza came out it was a big disappointment.  It didn't help when the waiter added dry, pre-shaved Parmesan cheese on top of it.

Pan pizza 2* - crust was soggy not flaky at all, sauce was nothing special.....not worth the wait!!

I will come back again and see if their thin crust is any better."}
{"text":"I had some out of town friends and needed to find a kid friendly place in the area so I figure I'll give Oregano's another try.  Sadly, I got burnt again.  Yes, we had to wait 45 min for a table in the hot patio, no biggie.  Then, we sat down in these super long booths that was hard to get out of with tons of people going up & down the narrow walkway.  

We order a 18\" thin crust pizza (since I was burn with a pan pizza last time), salad, bread sticks, chicken wings and a kids' meal.  Waited about 30 minutes with no food.  So I ask our waitress if we can have the salad & kids' meal now.  She said she had to check w/ the kitchen.  She comes back and told me no b/c they were together...what?!!?!  15 min later she brings out the bread sticks & kids meal.  Then the pizza, salad & wing.  What the hell is wrong w/ their expediting?!?!  The only dish that was decent was the Big Beefstro Salad.  Thin crust was a big disappointment.  3 strikes is enough for me.  Will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. First time we came and waited forever. Thought we would try again people came in after us and got served before us. Ordered appetizer and no silverware to eat it. Finally had to ask and got siverware. We usually leave 20 plus tip. Not today. Husband said pizza only good thing about this place. Feel bad about so small of a tip but hubby said that is it."}
{"text":"I recently had a less than satisfactory experience while visiting this Oregano's .  Shortly after I visited , I wrote a review and was kindly contacted by Kristen M.  I was given an opportunity to come back and last night I took them up on this offer .  I was sat at the exact same table and was immediately impressed .  Our waiter (Chico) was extremely pleasant and prompt.  He came by several times to check on us did an excellent job at stating on top of our food and drinks.  We were all pleased and will definitely be coming back .  Thanks Oteganos for doing the right thing and for getting me to come back ."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly, and atmosphere was fun, but the Margherita pizza (thin crust) was the worst I have ever had. Mozzarella was so thin you couldn't even taste it. Tasted like cardboard."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night, we sat outside...
fun place with great music...pizza was great..very thin crust, loved the kale Cesar salad and the meatballs..can't remember our waitress's name but she had a purple ponytail...great service as well....definitely will be going back"}
{"text":"Amazing!! 

The restaurant had an old-fashioned feel to it. With the decor and menus. 

The service is always fun and easy going. 

The food is worth the wait. Thin crust is amazing. Deep crust takes like 40min to cook, but totally worth it. They have great guac as well. Delicious! We have family visit is once a year and they always ask to visit oreganos. 

I have heard their cookie dessert is amazing as well. But I've always been too full to order one because the pizza is so good. 

Love it here!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for years! You just can't beat anything on the menu here, awesome pizza, yummy pasta and salads!  To top it all of don't forget the amazing cookie pie served straight out of oven in a pan topped with vanilla cream !!  The service is always amazing! Get there there early because lines form up and the wait can be pretty long on peak hours."}
{"text":"We were told to head here from multipule people.  I usually don't trust people, cuz you are all a bunch of fibbers, but we decided we'd try some pie and head over here.

Cheese Bread - a must.  If you do not, you might as well go again because you missed out GREATLY.  Maybe the best thing about this place is the cheese bread.

Pie - It's decent.  I have nothing more to say.

Service - Above and beyond any other service we had while vacationing in AZ (including the people we stayed with).  They acidently screwed up on one half of a pizza we ordered (we didn't even notice) and they came back with a whole Large pie of the kind we ordered.  Then, they not only gave us 20% but our whole party of 8!  It was unreal since we didn't even ask for it (or notice).  That's the kind of serivce that should be everywhere.

Atmosphere - Schweet.  Very fun, unique, and Chicago style joint in AZ."}
{"text":"I had driven by Oreganos for years and always meant to go in.  Finally I had dinner there!  I ordered a pizza with sausage, mushrooms and anchovies.  Love anchovies!  Pizza was topped with mozzarella.  So cheesy and good!  Hard to remember a better pizza.  Great for breakfast the next morning.  Wonderful server.  He was attentive and always had a smile.  A very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"The service was horrible!!! My family of four was here for over two hours on Monday night. Once we were finally seated to a table we were given our drinks semi quickly and an appetizer shortly following. As we sat and waited we watched the table in front of us get their appetizer their dinner and their desert all before we were even given our food. We then watched another table of 6 that had come in a good 45 minutes after us get their food. We ordered one pizza with a side of wings and a child's pepperoni pizza nothing too complex. We had arrived at the restaurant a couple minutes after 7 and now it was 10 till 9 I wanted to walk out the door but my husband already ordering the food felt bad leaving. I waited for the waitress to apologize for the wait but nothing came if anything she purposely neglected our table to avoid any confrontation because of the error. I gave it the benefit of the doubt assuming that her or her supervisor would be coming to our table when our bill was delivered to apologize and hopefully comp something or at least discount the bill. Nothing of the sort was given and we will never be dining there again."}
{"text":"I've patronized this place several times and in comparison to other spots....the food is okay.  Not worth the service wait.  Most recently, I ordered the Flagstaff salad to go - it was the hugest mound of spinach leaves I've ever seen sprinkled with (and this is no joke) three pieces of red pepper, two tablespoons of garg cheese, a platter of mushrooms, and 3 pieces of onion.  All for only $8.  I feel like a cheated rabbit.  Saving grace - the drink!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Try the spinach artichoke dip and grab a peach 4 peaks beer! Their pizza is delicious and try a peanut butter cookie for desert! The atmosphere is cute, it's old school music from the 40's/50's. Don't walk in starving though bc there is always a wait!"}
{"text":"I had the thin crust pizza with bacon.  I thought it was a bit too salty.  The cheese seems like it's not attached to the pizza.  You can peel it off.  It wasn't awful but not that great.  My cousin loves it though.  

It was odd when I picked up my pizza the girl at the front counter said she couldn't find my pizza.  She said she would go look for it.   She went to the pizza chef and he said it was in the warming oven at the front desk where it was supposed to be.  She never looked there.  It's not a big deal just kind of gave the impression they need a little more training."}
{"text":"I told my wife not to make me come here and she didn't listen.  I waited forever for take out.  They screwed up the order beyond belief.  The staff doesn't know the ingredients in their own products.  I waited 30+ minutes for them to fix an order that very explicitly said \"no cheese\".  I brought home the wrong sandwich to my wife because they screwed up.  One tiny container of sauce for a bucket of pasta?  Disaster.  Wife called back and the manager offered to remove just the sandwich.  When she asked if that was really all they were going to do, the manager said \"I don't know what else you want me to do.\". Hmmmm.  How about manage the restaurant, teach employees the ingredients in your food, and provide a certain level of customer service when you colossally screw up?  I'm glad she finally realizes how much this place sucks because I've known it for years.  Never again.  One star is generous."}
{"text":"I love this place. I had a messed up order for take out and live 20 minutes away. Al was more than gracious and handled it excellent. I would come back even had they not done as well but the way it was handled just assured a loyal customer. Be aware they are busy though."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff. Italian Guacamole - must try this appetizer!!"}
{"text":"I used to think this place was really good, when I went to school in Arizona, but when I moved to San Francisco, I learned what \"real\" Italian food should taste like.

The pluses for this spot are that its a fun hangout and that you get a lot for your money, although I think that the portions are too-large.

I liked the mexican salad and I thought that the giant cookie was good, but overall, very average at best.....since AZ isn't exactly the HQ of culinary delights, I'll let it slide, but I think that they could make it more authentic and less Americanized"}
{"text":"Hello Service,

 i have been here before and got my zany ziti in 15-20min this time at 40min i had to take it to go!! 



THE FOOD WAS GREAT"}
{"text":"HIGHLY recommend!!!!! Friendly server.  Just the right attention.  Best appetizer ever was the Huge Guaca-tony.... the pizza chips were over the top crazy good.  Fantastic prices, especially for Sedona ares"}
{"text":"Best thin Chicago style pizza I have EVER had. And I've had a lot of pizza."}
{"text":"Our waiter was awesome! He was sooo flamboyantly fun and colorful! I got the chicken alfredo and it was so creamy and sexy. The chicken is kind of weird though as it's shredded and chewy. It's almost like dog food. Let me tell you about the cocktails though!!! They are sooooo good! I had the ginger beer one and it was soooo bomb! You have to get that! Then I had the root beer cocktail thing and it was sooo good! Nice and strong and the flavor was amazing ! Oh the bruschetta is forgettable so don't even order that. Plus they forgot to give it to us and we had to remind them after our meal arrived 
They said their pizzas take an hour to cook so I passed on that. I recommend coming here for the cocktails. The food is mediocre in my opinion."}
{"text":"Bartender knew everything that was on the menu.  Had great suggestions for dinner.  She was quick to refill our waters and get my soup out first.  It's close to my salon, so I'll be back for sure.  Yummy yummy to my tummy!!"}
{"text":"This is a difficult place for me to review.. I love going and have been many times. They (and almost all Oregano's) really do the patio right (which, more than anything, is what brings me back).

The pizza cookie (formerly pizookie before a legal battle with BJ's which does a much worse job at the same) is about the best I've had anywhere and I highly recommend it (white chocolate macadamia nut in particular even though I'm not a macadamia nut fan).

The best pizza they have is unfortunately no longer on the menu because it was a pain to make but they do decent enough pizzas and have a great caesar salad. They also have decent hot wings.

If you're nearby and the line isn't insane, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after our attempt at mexican food failed. This place ended up pretty awesome. Pizza was great and different. Who would have thought eating pizza in squared slices other than the traditional wedges would have been so cool? 

The dessert topped our evening with the baked cookies with ice cream on top - we came out a 5 pounds heavier with a smile on our faces!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  So not a fan of their pizza but they have the best salads and awesome iced tea. Love sitting outside here. Great lunch spot!!  Great for take out. Oregano's is yummy."}
{"text":"looking for a comfortable spot to have some of the best grubouts of your life? oreganos is the place. its italian comfort food at a very budget friendly price. i know the name says \"pizza bistro\" but ive only had pizza here once (have heard good things about their thin crust thru others). i usually stick to their pastas, sandwiches, side sausages, and appetizers and im completely fine giving them 5 stars based off that alone. you wont ever order anything and wish it was bigger because this place has never skimped on portions. i come here to get my garlicky cheesy tastebud fix (about 1x/week). service is good. most of the time, theres a wait but its worth it. if youre lookin for fancy italian, this is probably not ur spot. keep nomin!!"}
{"text":"This Oreganos (like any other actually) would get 5 stars if it wasnt for the wait.  

The parking sucks (try behind Salty Senorita next door) and the line wraps around thie building usually.  But once inside, service is stellar and the food is delicious.  

My favorite is the white pizza, with no red sauce, tomotoes and basil....mmmm.  MUST have the bazookie or whatever its called here--the giant half baked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream...literally the best dessert on the planet.  

Dress is casual, great for entertaining out of town family members."}
{"text":"Supper cute place at night! The food was good too, but I was a hair tipsy too . Good service, and we didn't havto wait too long to get seated at 9pm on Sunday."}
{"text":"LOVE OREGANOS! Not only is the food exceptional but I have not ONCE had terrible service here. And I frequented here a lot let me tell you. I miss it dearly now that I have moved back to Cali, but when I was at ASU I was a customer at least 2-3 times a month. Its a wonder I didnt gain 200 lbs. Cause it is delicious but I never said it was healthy....Every time I am in town I go to Oreganos once sometimes twice in the 2-4 day visits. Have to its mandatory!

I request you franchise out to California....pretty pretty please!! :-)"}
{"text":"Our families favorite restaurant. Tonight we celebrated a family members 13th birthday! We had the pleasure of being served by Vanessa, who did an amazing job. She always kept our water glasses filled, served us with a smile, provided excellent suggestions on dishes, and even ended our dinner with a birthday pazookie (the real reason we come to Oreganos). 

We'd like to recognize Vanessa as being not only the best server we've had at Oreganos, but the best server we've had in the valley! Thank you.

The Schertz Family"}
{"text":"Stopped by as a recommendation from a friend's coworker to try while we were in Tempe for Spring Training.  Have to admit, I usually don't trust the recommendations of people I don't know directly, but they were right about Oreganos.

-The place was absolutely packed on Thursday night, one sign of how popular the place must be, especially with the locals.

-The service was prompt and courteous.  We were never left too long without being checked upon.  Their \"Legalize Marinara\" t-shirts also helped keep my wife entertained because she thought they were taking a stance and legalizing MARIJAUNA... which was highly entertaining

-Now to the best part, the food. Our friends got the Chicago stuffed pizza, which had a wait time of 45 minutes, but was so worth the wait.  One of the best pizza's I have ever seen, tasted, smelled, etc.  My wife and I split one of their salads, which was huge!  It was also very good, not quite CPK good, but close.

-In summary, if you are looking for good food in a casual atmosphere give Oreganos a try!"}
{"text":"Oreganos has definitely stepped their game up the past couple years. My first experience was probably 4-5 years ago and wasn't impressed. A few weeks ago I went with some family members and was completely blown away with how great it was. 

Tonight I ordered a pepperoni pizza and calamari to go. Calamari is my favorite! Fresh, not chewy and seasoned well. Pizza is amazing, huge fan of the thin crust."}
{"text":"So we went to this place thinking it was just going to be another Italian restaurant. Definitely the selection and menu size was very large, maybe a little overwhelming at first for new timers like us but what we did order was delicious! Service was very good no complaints. We did have a deep dish pizza and were informed about the wait time for that being about an hour which was well worth the wait. Then I ordered pasta which was just amazing as well. We were there at a very peak and busy time and although we had to wait awhile to be seated and wait for the Pizza, but that wasn't a problem for the quality food or service we got! For this out of state girl this is a place to try at least once while in town."}
{"text":"First time here today.  We had a party of 9 and called ahead and still waited 45 minutes for a table, then were seated outside under the heat lamps, so had to ask twice to get them turned off.  Finally got the orders taken, a few of our party had their orders in 10 or 15 minutes.  I ordered the big slice and a garden salad.  The salad arrived quick and was warm, it had obviously been out a while.  It took the pizza another 30 minutes to arrive, and I was getting ready to leave without it.  The pizza was pretty good but nothing spectacular.  The food was decent and I would eat it again, but the disorganized service needs some work, especially during lunch when people are on a time-limit.  There were 4 servers on the patio, and they seemed clueless as to what was going on."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in AZ.  They give dough to the kids to entertain themselves with. I always get the thin crust, and the garlic cheese bread.  The pizza is much better dining in then carry out.  When we do carry out it's always cold, even though we live 5 minutes away from one of their locations..."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza and I loved their garlic cheese bread. This reminds me of pizza I grew up with in Minnesota. Hubby surprised me some for dinner at home.  From the time he picked it up (they said fresh out of the oven) and drove 5 minutes it was cold... as in maybe was it sitting out for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite restaurant. It helps that I live down the street. The pasta here is phenomenal, I always get the big rig pasta with chicken - to die for!! They are also known for their refillable bowl of pasta. If you happen to have enough room after your meal, you HAVE to get the baked pizookie. It is a warm and gooey chocolate chip cookie with ice cream, good for a group. The best dessert I've ever had for sure!"}
{"text":"We were having some work done on our car at Sun Devil Auto and decided to walk over to Oregano's to have lunch while we waited. We had never been here before, but it smelled amazing outside, and we couldn't help but laugh at the signs outside (Legalize Marinara, LOL). We entered and were immediately greeted by a cheery man whom we later found out was the manager. But I am getting ahead of myself. He seated us right away and we were soon greeted by a wonderful server (who's name slips my mind - really should've written this the same day we came). She told us all about the restaurant, various menu items, and helped us narrow down our choices. They have a LOT of very interesting dishes listed and we had trouble choosing so we decided to split a huge slice of pizza as an appetizer (yum!), then my hubby went for El Diablo Shrimp Pasta (spicy shrimp dish over pasta) for there, and Italian Flag Lasagna to take home for dinner! I selected Stuffed Riga Tony (yes I spelled that correctly, they have all kinds of puns on the menu) for my eat-in lunch, and Alfredo's Artichoke Lasagna to take home for dinner. It was all quite scrumptious! I will admit, the Artichoke Lasagna confused my taste-buds...they insisted I was eating a dip and should've had chips with it, but it was still good. We liked it so much, we went back the very next week to try some more. Hubby had the Shrimp Pasta again because he craved it all week, and I tried a huge Kale salad (Oregano's Power Greens). I was a little hesitant at first because I had never had raw Kale and heard it was gross, but I went out on a limb and am SOOO glad I did! It was one of the best salads I have ever had. This should give you a good idea on what to start with anyway. I am super picky and don't usually try new things. I am happy to report that Oregano's did not disappoint and I cannot wait until we are near there again so we can try even more dishes. Staff is amazing, food is delicious, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Another great meal and experience at Oreganos. Our server, Sarah, was wonderful. Attentive but not \"too much\", you know what I'm talking about!! ;) 

Can't go wrong with the Guaca Tony and our pizza was delish, like always at Oreganos."}
{"text":"So glad they opened one by me. Much better now that the snowbirds are gone and it's not an hour wait. Favorite Surprise restaurant."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago, and still live there, so I do know a bit about Chicago style pizza.  We were staying in Cave Creek back in September, and noticed the Oregano's on Cave Creek Road.  There were only two of us, so we were seated immediately in the very nice outdoor area.  Being hungry, we decided to have an appetizer with our selected craft beers, and decided on the Guaca-Tony, which is a deliciously huge cool guacamole appetizer pizza.  This could have been filling enough, but we also ordered a pan pizza.  The pizza was great, and I consider it the closest to Chicago style in the Phoenix area.  We've had others, and this was the best!

Our waiter (Connor I believe), was great, and the atmosphere was fun and relaxed.  We got such a kick out of the waiters wearing their \"LEGALIZE MARINARA\" T-shirts, that we had to pick up a few to bring home.

From a Chicagoan's point of view, Oregano's is definitely the closest to home in the Phoenix area, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Oregano Pizza Joint.  I enjoyed the friendly welcome by the host who gave us an option on seating and provided advise on decision made.  Our waitress, Angela, was natural and genuine.  The menu mimiced other pizza bistros.  I found the \"Chicago\" style Italian sausage sandwich with all the fixins.  I, being a Chicago native, was especially interested in the Italian beef & sausage with peppers Sandwich.  Unfortunately, the sandwich cost was overpriced for the the combination of italian beef and a side order of italian sausage.   Chicago style would offer a combination sandwich for less than $20. The sandwich combo was good but definitely overpriced.  I would not order that sandwich again and may question other prices on the menu."}
{"text":"Five star experience. The new lasagna was excellent especially when a bite included a sun dried tomato. 

Four Peaks red lager was excellent.  Highly recommend everyone try this place out."}
{"text":"The food is always really good and the portions are huge. 

However, the kitchen has no idea what it means to bring the meal out together or what it means to be fast. Servers are no better. Our server brought our cheesy garlic bread and my husband's pizza out at the same time. When we were done with the garlic bread and the pizza, they finally got my mushrooms out. This was after the manager, not the waiter, came over and asked if everything was okay. Don' expect to eat with others at your table."}
{"text":"A tasty and quick lunch.

I was driving by Orgnaos this afternoon and decided to stop by and grab a quick lunch. The hostess seated me immediately and I was served my drink and given a menu within a few minutes.. 

The staff at Oreganos are friendly and accomdating. My entree was prepared and served quicker then expected. Today I ordered the stuffed crust pizza, and a salad.  The salad was served cold, and the ingredients were fresh. The pizza was good, but not the best I ever had at Oreganos (little soggy). 

The prices are a bit higher than average, but not unreasonable. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"A nice visit 

I was very excited when Orrganos Pizza Bistro opened a Westside location.   I had tried several times to have lunch at the Goodyear's location, however every time, we ran into a lengthy wait for a table and choose not to wait.

I was driving by late afternoon on a weekday and decided to stop by and try my luck. The hostess advised of a 20 minute wait and we were seated within 10 minutes. 

The staff is friendly and accomdating. Although, on this visit service was a little slow.  However, the food was prepared and served quicker then expected. We split garlic bread, stuffed crust pizza, and a salad.  The salad was served cold, and the ingredients were fresh. The pizza was good, but not the best I ever had at Oreganos (little soggy). 

The prices are a bit higher than average, but not unreasonable. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Every oregano oreganos I've been to had bad service and the food was just ok. I definitely could had better food else where and better service. 
The sauce tasted spicy even on kids sauce."}
{"text":"I came quite a distance to meet friends here. My expectations were high. I have been hearing about Oreganos for years. I was totally disappointed. The garlic bread was like something I made when I was 5, Stale, cold, and, boring, and unappetizing. Nothing special. We ordered the pizza, can't remember what it was called. but it had spinach, artichokes, kalamata olives, tomatoes, the most horrible, bland, cardboard thing I have ever consumed. It just shows you how uneducated, and uninspired most of  these crappy chains are. Not to mention how uninspired their clientele is. It also shows how few good restaurants there are out there. When we arrived there was about 30 people outside waiting. really! How sad. Cave Creek......you must really suck! I suppose when the alternatives are Harold's and the Cave Creek smoke house, anything looks good. Pay another $5 in gas and go somewhere good. Pay $10 and live it up! Here's a better idea! Open a shitty restaurant in Cave Creek and rake in the bucks!"}
{"text":"No wait which after talking to our nice waitress we found is very rare especially on weekends. Food was delicious and since it was our first visit we got free dessert. We opted for the cookie bake thing and OMG sooooo good!"}
{"text":"You gotta try Alfredo the Dark. A unique blend of Alfredo and poblano with fresh chopped tomatoes over cavatappi. Delicious..."}
{"text":"OMG!! The portobello mushroom appetizer and the roasted Brussels sprouts were ah-may-ZING!! I had the flag lasagna and the missus had a thin crust red jalapeño pizza (which we inhaled) and washed it down with Mojitos  We ended it with their cookie  Don't even pause - just order it and enjoy! We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and usually it's amazingly crowded to go along with it. Might be better since they opened their new location on Shea Blvd.  The food is really good and cheap, too- it's great to go with a group of friends. Share cheesy bread, pizza and pizzuki (i can't spell it, but its a warm chocolate chip cookie thing with ice cream!)"}
{"text":"Back again at Oreganos ! The wings a must try ! The garlic Parmesan wings are the best !!! The zucchini is a must try aswell as the fries so good ! My boys love the pizza cookie dessert with ice cream ! A great way to end a great meal !"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. We had the brussel sprouts that are to die for. We also ordered a house salad. Their salads are ginormous! Almost obnoxious.  We also had the wheat crust BBQ pizza. All fantastic.  Can't wait to go to Oregano's again next time we are in AZ."}
{"text":"So delicious! Everything we have ever had! The service is great too! The only bummer is everyone else loves this place as much as we do! I suggest you go early--or order takeout, an hour before you want it on weekends! 
But seriously, this place is great."}
{"text":"We love Oregano's! This location is even better since the expansion of the dining area. Great food, great drinks, and the servers are some great people. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Always the best pizza and full menu you could want, a little something for everyone! The drinks here rock too, the frozen balienee  (sp?) was great too"}
{"text":"Im from Cali and just visiting and I dont have anything horrific to say here. My visit was a pleasant one and id surely come back. 
Having sad that,  the wait was confusing, but i believe the young hostess simply didnt know how to quote a wait.  Its ok, i get it. The food was delicious. All my substitution requests went in unscathed and worry-free (as they should). I had the Alfredo the dark, w/sausage and opted for bowtie pasta in lieu of the spiral.  Scrumptious!!  I was put off, however,  by the huge sausages that accompanied the meal. I was expecting them to be sliced up for me or maybe crumbled, not set atop my food, but i gladly ate ONE. Two was too much. Maybe give me the choice of 1 or 2, not just heres two.. Mangia!!  Courtney was nice and attentive, and OMG, now that i think about it, i completely forgot to tip her!!  Epic fail. Ill def be back before i head home next week. Wow. Super sorry Courtney!!  The atmosphere was chill, welcoming and it didnt break the bank.  So like the guy below said...  solid place.  You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for probably 10 years now. Organoes on Shea has been my home since I was a kid. It's been a little while since I've been in, and I can't say anything has changed! I love that. 
Started off in the outside bar with a frozen bellini. Lara was so nice but I decided to opt for a booth inside. I was really sad that my favorite shrimp Caesar is no longer on the menu but my server, Rachael was happy to accomadate something essantially the same. 
As always; great atmosphere, food and drinks. It's what I've come to expect from oreganos."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST PIZZA , and SERVICE I have ever had in my 50 some years! A definite go to neighborhood Pizza and Bistro for everyone !
When are we going to have one of your Bistros in our community in Massachusetts? ???? I'm interested! !!!
Great food , excellent accomidating Servers with awesome personalities.
 When I'm back in town I will definitely revisit this establishment !!!"}
{"text":"It was amazing, I had the 'Shroom Boom Pasta & I loved it!  I have had it twice now and expect to have it many more times!!"}
{"text":"I kind of liked this place.

The only bad thing about it is that everyone else does too, so you'll be waiting a while for a table.

You can usually abscond to the bar and sit at the counter and order with a far lesser delay.

Yes.  The place does serve pizza, but it does have some other italian-type favorites on the menu as well.

It is an actual fun atmosphere in here.  Unless you are seriously emo and trying to cut yourself with a butterknife the whole time, you will be likely to enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food was okay but not worth the 2-3 hours wasted. Would have tried anywhere else."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza place. It's really cute, with little buildings surrounding a courtyard, for indoor and outdoor seating. 

Terrific Chicago style thin crust (especially Lawrence's Original) The guacamole appetizer has a great wow factor - fresh, flavorful, and comes with it's own pizza crust with a thin layer of cheese, for dipping. 

Our server, Kaitlyn, was amazing! She was warm and friendly, made great suggestions, and appeared with anything we needed before we even realized we needed it! Overall, wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"What a great place!!  The wait can be a little crazy, but the food is delicious, the service is always great and the atmosphere is adorable!  

It's a really neat setup - huge outdoor patio with seating and bar, plus waiting area.  Then a building with a smaller, cozier indoor seating section.  There are tons of neat, old-timey decorations, including old movie/ ad posters.  The colors are mostly red and green, and it all comes together nicely in every Oregano's, including this one.

We ordered an 18\" thin crust Sproccolli, which lasted for two meals for us.  The crust is super thin and the ingredients are spread over it lighty.  The flavors are wonderful - just a little sauce, cheese, topping, garlic, etc. - making each bite light and tasty, but still filling.  It's pretty delicious cold, too.  Can't wait to try the thicker pizza, too!

The service has always been really outstanding, in my experience.  I joke that, at Oregano's, they always treat you like they just found out you're Yelp Elite (even though I've been coming here since before I learned about Yelp)."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my boyfriend last night.  Our server Andrew had a great suggestion for the salad while we waited for our pizza.  He gave us stellar service, always letting us know how much longer for the pizza and kept our beverages topped off.  I was upset at myself because I forgot my bf's birthday email for a free pizza cookie and Andrew gave one to us anyway.  Thank you Andrew and Oregano's for a great experience."}
{"text":"Seriously, how could anyone rate this less than four stars? Perhaps you didn't have the pan style pizza. It's amazingly awesome! I think it's better than Lou Malnati's in Chicago or that other place I went to. I'll admit, the thin crust is lacking. But, the pan is the bomb. There is no better place in the valley for pan pizza, period!"}
{"text":"Better than buccas mushroom plate was a 5***** our  service was great  will be going again"}
{"text":"Antipasto Salad amazing serves 2 of us with leftovers! Donald was an outstanding server!!"}
{"text":"The Boom Dip, Picasso salad, and the Pizza Cookie were out of this world! We came here for Father's Day. We had excellent service from Sarah B. She was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. We'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Went on the suggestion of a store clerk at the mall after he learned of our Chicago heritage. 

We ordered a thin crust pizza and an order of wings solely upon the bros suggestion. 

We arrived to bustling scene. The indoor seating was full as could be, but the patio was all ours. It was okay though because even though it was 104 out Oregano's has huge outdoor A/C units to beat the heat. Add in a superb service staff and you get a wonderful first couple of minutes. 

Then the food came. 

I wasn't crazy about the pizza but both of my friends were. The crust is crisp to almost a devilish point. It's delicious. The downfall is the lack of sauce and the one dimensional toppings. 

The wings on the other hand were divine. I'm not sure what made them, but I couldn't stop enjoying them. I would order another 50 if I could. 

5/5 I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great setting outdoors for a large group. Lunch specials/ mid day rush menu are limited in numbers but the quantity served is large enough to be a dinner.
I took the Big Rig with a sausage link on it. The pasta tasted really good, fresh and was served hot which made whole lot of difference. Overall a very good experience but my only complaint is the time to get the food. Took more than 40 mins for our order to come out."}
{"text":"I will quote the friend who recommended this restaurant word for word --- 

\"Oregano's is the only decent place to go to in Tempe. Don't go anywhere else.\"

That is what he said. \"It's the only place that isn't a chain, at least Oregano's is an Arizona chain ...\"

So off we went, with good advice in hand and found the service to be fast, n' friendly, and the food fresh, hot, n' tasty. We had the Vino Bambino Jr. (really big for the two of us) and the El Picasso thin crust pizza. The Vino Bambino needed extra dressing, but it was yum, and the El Picasso was good .... but we could have gotten something a little better. It was the corn strips on top that threw us off!

Overall though, we liked it and it was a hit-the-spot type of meal that didn't hurt our wallets at all ..."}
{"text":"We had a coupon for a free \"Guaca-Tony\".  And we'd heard some good things, so here we are!

Well, kinda wish we hadn't.  First, let me say the server and manager were very good.  They did their best to take care of us.  That's good...but...

The Guaca-Tony bread was very salty.  No idea why, but it was.  And I LIKE salt.  I'm a potato chip junkie.  But it just didn't work here.  The guacamole was mediocre, too.  Definitely \"meh\".  If it hadn't been free we might have sent it back.

The calamari was overcooked, too heavily breaded, and salty.  We actually sent that one back.  If you read my reviews you would know I almost never do that.  Maybe once a year.   

Lastly we got the rigatoni.  It was spicy and pretty good.  We added meatballs.  They were OK.  Not fabulous, but OK.  Reasonably large, too (though not large like Buca).  The garlic bread that came with it was salty. What's with all the salt? I love salt, but this was too much.  I've never experienced this before.  And it wasn't just me.  My wife had the same reaction.

I'm surprised to see four stars on Oregano's.  Maybe if we had ordered the pizza instead?  But what we ordered was mostly disappointing.  I don't think we'll be back, even though we have another free Guaca-Tony coupon.  I do appreciate the server and the concern of the manager whom the server notified, but that's not enough to make up for mediocre food."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for our great visit at Oregano's, as always. We love visiting Oregano's while in Phoenix and this location in Tempe didn't disappoint.

We ordered the artichoke dip, but were a little disappointed that the bread served with it wasn't hotter. The pizza was excellent and the only thing we'd have changed if possible, was to leave room for one of the great desserts!

Our server was busy, sometimes it seemed a little too busy, as we had to ask for refills and for our check, but things happen. She was trying and was friendly, which goes a long way."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to Oregano's locations throughout the valley and this location has been great both times I dinned here. 

Steak salad is extremely good if you want to stay away from the starch! 

Love the service here!

Wait time has always been bad but hey, they are busy! I'd rather go to a busy restaurant than a dead one. Last experience at a restaurant that was rather dead resulted in food poisoning. There is a reason that people flock to certain restaurants!"}
{"text":"Beefstro salad is where it's at! Every time I have been to an Oregano's location, I have never been disapointed with having great service. At times, the wait can be a little long but they are busy so I can understand why."}
{"text":"Longest wait of my life. They said it would be twenty until we got a table..it was thirty. Then the waiter (who was super fun and nice, just like their entire staff) said it would be twenty for our pizza to be ready...it was forty. The food is always amazing, but I noticed a waitress bringing the manager a spoon with a little bug in it!!! Apparently someone found it in their food! The atmosphere is fun, but horrid for large groups. It's insanely loud and our table was super crowded. It was a table fit for four, seating seven. Despite all the negatives, the food is always delicious, that is the pizza is good. The shrimp scampi was dry and tasteless. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Love the Italian Wedding soup in a pizza Dough bowl! Fantastic outdoor seating with two fireplaces! Food is excellent and bartenders are great!"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday 03/08/2016 after not being there for almost 2 years.  Now I know why!  We were the first ones to sit in the \"inside\" main dining area.....3 more tables arrived within a 15-20 minute timeframe after that.  We ordered pizza.  The table behind us got there food.  An appetizer which had to go thru the oven.  The other table behind us got their sandwiches.  All this time we are seeing a pizza sit by the food pick up area.  The table next to us got their wine, but we watched our server look at the ticket on the pizza with wine and glasses all in one hand and proceed to deliver and open the bottle of wine which he was struggling to do.  Another person sat another table and again walked by the pizza.  I finally got up to see if it was ours and sure enough it was!   Finally a girl brought it over all happy about delivering it.  Well we told her we didn't want it as it was sitting for at least 15 minutes....She said it was under a heat lamp....YOU DON\"T LEAVE PIZZA UNDER A LAMP FOR THAT LONG!  She asked if I wanted to take a piece to see if it was still hot.  It was just okay and she offered a new one.  Well they made a new one and now it looked like they rushed it as the cheese was lightly melted no browning on top.  It looked bad!  the new young manager offered to buy the food and make another one.  We were already there over one hour and still hadn't eaten.  I said no we aren't waiting for another and left.  The piece of pizza that I tasted was so thin it was pathetic and tasted that burnt flavor for which it was on the edges.  This was my final time going here....funny we went some where else to eat and the people next to us told us about a problem they had at the Cactus rd location ...they aren't going back either.  This establishment has really gone bad and downhill and is very over rated.....PIZZA HUT is much better than they are believe it or not!  Don't waste your time here...."}
{"text":"Worse pizza I have ever had.....pizza was so dry n I asked for extra sauce....I didn't say no sauce !!!  Just awful.....crust so thin my crackers at home had more body than their crust.....this place has gone downhill for pizza.......won't ever be going back there at all !  Its certainly no big deal......not after tonight...."}
{"text":"I didn't care for the food, tasted reheated and the service was very poor. Our drinks were never refilled!"}
{"text":"Dine-in on a weekday during lunch hour. We were promply seated, that was a pleasant surprise because parking lot was full and we expected to wait. Hostess was nice but she kept making references to \"dinner\" and \"night\" even though it's noon, maybe she was covering somebody else's shift, anyway was just kind of odd.
The food comes out very fast from the time you order so that's great when you're hungry and have impatient kids. 
My pasta (Alfredo the dark) was a nice lunch portion but slightly dry with not enough sauce, not flavorful. Picaso salad was very nice with a very flavorful dressing portion is huge, would definitely get again! Was dissapointed with the pasta, is the only reason why I knocked some stars. :("}
{"text":"I've admitted in the past.  OPB is not my favorite place in the world to wine and dine.  I find it to be ordinary. I only go when a clueless friend or colleague decides it's the spot to meet at.  This time, I have to say, it wasn't so bad.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good eatery for other people...it just does not meet my dining style. I had the Mom's Sausage and Peppers plate...Yum! But I won't be going back until another clueless friend or colleague suggests it's the place to be."}
{"text":"Well, I won't be running back.  I didn't have a bad experience nor did I have a big meal just the BIG Bruschetta Authentico as an appetizer. And it was a BIG disappointment cause I was expecting BIG taste and there was no such thing.  Anyway, it's a cool spot with too much red going on."}
{"text":"We're from Chicago visiting AZ and we had really high expectations. This place is amazing!! We came on a weekday so the wait wasn't that bad. We were told the weekend waiting is really bad. But from the Salad, Pizza and desert it was delicious!! #SweetHomeChicago"}
{"text":"This place sucks. I waited 2 hours for my food and it got to the point where the table behind me of 10, got served, had eaten, and left by the time I got my food. I then proceeded to get my food to go for the long wait. Basically waited two hours for a pizza and a pasta TO GO."}
{"text":"I was impressed from the moment we entered. Everyone was lined up to get a table. We were a small party and thought we were sitting at a table that was a part of the bar. The manager, Garnet came to tell us we could stay there because everyone waiting wanted a bigger table (even though we skipped a step in the process). Later she moved us to the patio and it was a very enjoyable meal. The service was wonderful and the Power Greens Salad delicious. Garnet continued to be very personable and was a delight. I will definitely find my way back to this Pizza Bistro the next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"I do not understand why this place has such good reviews. The food was ok but the service was absolutely  terrible. Tons of food just waited by the kitchen counter because no waiters/waitresses would pick them up and deliver them to the customers. By the time we got our food, it was completely cold. Oh and pay attention when you are waiting for your seats. Because they mess up the waiting list a lot. They like to do their friends favors by letting them have the tables first."}
{"text":"Just had the veggie sandwich, terrible,eggplant was burned,looks  gross.tasted like the oil it was fried in was old.cant believe the cook even served this to me. Only thing they did right was not charge me!got sick after I left. Only had 2 bites,stomach cramps and the shits! Bad cook, makes a bad review!"}
{"text":"Ordered fries, garlic bread and eggplant lasanga. 
Fries are unbeatable, lasanga is good and garlic bread for some reason tasted  salty. Overall had a good experience."}
{"text":"Been here like couple of times now. Great ambience and quick service.
Ordered -
Eggplant Parmesan Pasta : I have been to one on elliot and ordered the same. Man, they taste exactly the same. Surprisingly good and served hot. 
It's a large portion for a single meal.
Hop Knot : its not my fav beer, but a good combo with the dish. 

Lil noisy ambience but who cares when you are talking too. Though it's a chain, they kinda maintain standards which I love.

My waitress was lil grumpy and it's was a busy Tuesday."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! Its probably not a good place for a first date, because you can expect to wait about 45 minutes to an hour to get a table, and another 30 to 45 minutes for your food (if you get their Chicago style crust) however, it is totally worth it if you enjoy the company of those you go with. Their pizza is wonderful, and a trip to Oregano's is simply incomplete without a pizzoki. If you enjoy drinks, their peach belini is great as well. I've never had something from Oregano's that I wouldn't advise someone else to order."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. My father in law was recently diagnosed with a secondary cancer. Luckily we found a match and had a stem cell transplant.  Problem is, he hass the immunity of a newborn and we have a checklist of safety measures. This was the only restaurant willing to go the extra mile preparing & cooking his food. As well as sitting us separately from the rest of the restaurant.  Will definitely be back! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"The three aspects I look forward to in a restaurant is great food, great atmosphere, great employees, and Oregano's Pizza Bistro hits all of those targets."}
{"text":"I don't know why I always have bad luck at Organos.  First off they have pepsi but they used to have great green tea so I agreed to go.  No more.  Sorry it was voted out.  Ok so I tried a passion fruit tea.  I drink green because it's supposed to be healthy.  But no big deal it wasn't bad.  We had great service.  Very nice young female.  Good sense of humor too.  We ordered.  She was helpful there.  I looked through yelp and found something that l couldn't live with out.  The girl ordered a chicken parm sandwich.  I noticed waffle fries so she switched out the chips.  She was very happy.  I got the Lady Shrimp Scampi.  I love fussilli pasta and shrimp.  It came out cold.  I mean the pasta was actually cold.  The shrimp looked under cooked.  Not crispy and plump like the photo someone had posted.  The waitress came and apologized.  She said is the pasta really cold.  I felt another peace and sure enough it was cold.  I said maybe I should get something else.  But she took it back and had them fix it.  Mean while I enjoyed a few waggle fries from the girl.  Her sandwich I have to say was very good.  The chicken was cooked perfect.  Crispy and juicy still.  The garlic break roll was warm and also perfect not over cooked or old or anything like my awful pasta.  They bring out another one but I have to say I'm pretty sure the cook just stuck it in the microwave because the sauce was now gross.  The shrimp still looked pathetic and pasta was chewy.  So I asked to order something else.  I got the anti pasta salad.  It came out and it was not bad.  IT's annoying how they load so much on there because my artichoke rolled off the plate and on to the floor.  But they give a few.  The issue here is that the tomato was chopped and few times I got tastes of rotten tomato.  And my tea.  Well by now it was 10pm and the other server dumped them all out.  I asked to try black but that was gone too.  So my rotten salad had to go with a water.  And that's my story.  But let's just think about this for one second.  The cook sent out a pasta dish with cold pasta.  It was actually cold to the touch.  I looked at it and could tell the shrimp didn't look right.  It's common to get shrimp that seems under cooked.  I think some cooks see it curled so they take it off the grill.  But you want to cook that shrimp so it has flavor.  This is why scampi is one of the best Shrimp dishes.  But then don't send it out tasting like it was microwaved.  But let's be honest the real crime here is the manager who didn't rush over to apologize.  She did come over and kind of mumbled I'm sorry about the ice tea I'll take that off your check.  Obviously you can't charge me for ice tea if I'm drinking water.  But if you care that much about customers being served cold pasta you don't care about training the cooks to make the food properly.  And you also wouldn't have them send out salad with rotten tomatoes.  Maybe offer a free desert or something.  What I probably should have done was just leave and gone home and ate instead of them having to make food for me now when they are supposed to be closed.  Obviously they aren't going to care at that point they want to go home.  But don't compensate customers who are there an hour now still waiting for diner . At least my girl enjoyed her chicken parm sandwich.  It was good.  But I'm not sure how I can ever go back there.  Having a nice server isn't enough.  There are 100 other places in Tempe to eat.   I used to really like Oreganos when they first opened in Scottsdale while I was in college it was one of my favorite places to go.  It's a shame."}
{"text":"Man, this place is the real deal. I love their wings. We always get a larger Honey Gold. The sauce is a honey mustard, and the way they do their wings along with the crisp of the chicken is amazing. Feel free to ask for more sauce if you want more flavor.

We also shared a Numero Uno flat bread. It was good.

Can't say anything bad about this place. Food is always consistently good."}
{"text":"This has nothing to do with the food more or less the location is stuck in the 1800's and does not take reservations. And by no means is it a five-star restaurant that can get away with their food and service to justify not having reservations. We arrived on a Friday night with a party of seven and were told we would have almost a two hour wait. What we came to notice is that they only have three tables of that can accommodate anything more than a party of 6! After about an hour and 45 minutes and multiple people complaining about the amount of time we left and found her way to streets of New York that we can walk right in and have just as good food."}
{"text":"Seriously! We went here the other night for our grandsons birthday...8 years old...the boys a genius! Got the Shrimp Diablo and it was the best Italian food I've ever eaten. It was amazing. We need one or more in Salt Lake City...hint,  hint. Had a Greyhound and it was okay but not sure how much taste grapefruit and vodka are going to deliver but had their version of a Long Island Ice Tea and it was also the best I've ever had. The server (Mechelle) and service was really great and it was a fun atmosphere...we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is OMG!!! So Guuud! :D
We had the House Salad with Ranch for a appetizer. The Deep Dish pizza with meatballs, sausage, bacon, pepperoni, mushrooms and olives. It was AMAZING! Plus, they add fresh grated parmesan right at the table. Everything was fresh, tasted so yummy and the cheese was such good quality. Our waiter Charles was so nice and personable. His kindness was refreshing and much appreciated. We got a Pizza cookie with ice cream on the house! It was well worth it. The design of the restaurant was pretty cool with the 50's-60's vibe. The atmosphere was enjoyable. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Took longer than expected to get our pick-up order but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken chipotle pizza along with the stuffed pizzas.  There are at least three or four appetizers that are top notch as well.  This place is always crazy crowded, but the food is excellent."}

{"text":"This review is for the location on Elliot Rd in Tempe, however a lot of my comments apply to the entire chain.  I've been to Oregano's many times since moving to the Phoenix area, and up until recently it was my favorite pizza place in the valley.  However since they have changed their menu things have really seemed to go downhill.  

The menu variety has been reduced drastically, many of the items that were my favorites are not even available any more (Chipotle Chicken Club Pizza, I'm looking at you).  No doubt this was to cut down on food cost, but the result is that a lot of the things that made Oregano's great no longer exist.  

The execution of the menu items that they do have has been inconsistent for me the last three or four visits.  Today at the Elliot location the stuffed pizza that we ordered came out way overdone, the crust was pretty burnt.  Anybody that has ordered one of these pizzas before knows that they take nearly an hour to prepare.  There was no way we were going to send it back and wait another hour for a replacement.  Unfortunately issues like this seem to be becoming common for the chain.  

I could go on with issues seen during previous recent visits, but the bottom line is that there are too many good pizza places around to spend any more time with this one.  I no longer recommend the chain, and probably will not return."}
{"text":"A cool place to visit and dine outdoors. I enjoyed the outside decor. If you are a avocado fan a MUST have is their appetizer: Guacatini I believe it's called. It is an Italian version of quacamole and served with ultra thin bread. The guac has fresh basil throughout it. It is plentiful and addicting. I will return just for this!!

I would pass on the calamari appetizer. It was served extremely greasy and the batter was super dark/brown. My assumptions is that they didn't change out the oil for frying for quiet sometime. The calamari meat itself was tender so this is the reason of my assumption. 

I can ONLY recommend the quacamole appetizer."}
{"text":"I love this place!  We eat here a couple of times a week. Great salads and pizza!  Fantastic service folks. I would recommend to anyone I talk to."}
{"text":"The only downside of this place is the wait.  The problem with being this good is that you are always busy, but that is a great problem to have.  Love their pizza and their Garlic bread.  Also, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! We mostly do takeout and it's always great! We love making our own creation and it's always made with fresh ingredients. Hint: ask them to slice it for you because it's much easier. For takeout, order well in advance."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in a long time. Yum!! This place has you at the door with the delicious aromas from the kitchen. The service is good and the place is clean. Love the thin crust pizza! I seriously can't wait to get to go back"}
{"text":"Love their pizza, and baked ravioli. Amazing ingredients, you can taste the difference. You can also order to pick up, which is amazing when you get off work and don't want to sit around a bunch of people. I have had a lot of pizza, from to New York style pizza, to authentic Italian style pizza, and I love them all, but I have to say this is still one of my favorite places to eat. The only reason I am giving this restaurant 4 stars is I am not impressed with their online menu, but overall this is a amazing place to eat."}
{"text":"Hotel sent us here for pasta and pizza.  Busy place so you'll likely wait.   Pizza has mediocre.  Nothing special in my opinion.  Waitress brought us an order of cheese bread..... It was only about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide.  Enough for only one person but she knew all three of us were eating It.  Waitress was in outer space!!  Wish I remembered her name, but she's need to get out of waitressing and serving people.  Awful !!   I'd pass and skip this place in my opinion."}
{"text":"Oregano's on Camelback is one of our favorite places to go for dinner & some beers. We always take out of town guests there.

The outdoor seating in particular is one of our favorite places to hang out, eat and drink. You can enjoy your food while relaxing in an oasis-like environment outside, enjoying the breeze, the sun or a sunset. Good music is always playing (jazz and other boppy tunes) and they have heaters over the tables outside for when it gets cold at night.

They have a decent beer and wine selection, including some good ones for beer connoisseurs. Pitchers of beer pricing is reasonable.

The food is fantastic. For appetizers, we really like the Guacatoni (quesadilla served with fresh guac) and the spicy ravioli's. Pizza lovers will love their selection of pie types and calzones. There's also a good variety of pastas and salads.

For us, it doesn't get much better then Oregano's. Yes, the place is usually crowded and you'll have to wait for a table. Yes, there are birds tweeting and hopping around outside, but we love the atmosphere and the food and drinks."}
{"text":"I live right behind  this establishment and refuse to eat there based on how I see the placed cleaned up. The trash they let pile up on the back of their patio is disgusting. Empty crushed pizza boxes just tossed out, tables and chairs haphazardly pushed aside. Makes me wonder how the food is handled."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very friendly servers, great music, and the pasta looks and tastes great too. Huge, enormous portions. The plate I ordered could have easily satisfied two people. I will definitely be heading here again"}
{"text":"The best part of going out and spending money on food you can make at home, is clearly the overall experience. The food here is great...price and portion wise. The service; however,  is HORRRRRRRRRIBLE comical but at the end of the day just HORRIBLE!

We went during the lunch  rush so a wait was expected! Not over an hour though for salads and sliced pizza. She missed one of our table guest order (and by miss I mean neglected to add it in at all, even though hers was the FIRST one taken. 

Two of our party paid with cash which she just kept. Im not going to lie, this seriously made me laugh...that lady stayed true to her \"IDGAF\" attitude so its sorta made the rest of the visit bearable just from the conversation we got to have!

None of the drinks or water were refilled and when asked on the status of the food the response was \"I dont know I dont work in the kitchen\" rude YES, but I still had a great laugh! 

If management is reading this, your waitress Emma is in the wrong line of business, she needs to be in collections! CUT THROAT! Also, its never a great idea to blame someones lack of customer service on \"them being new\"! Everyone is new at some point, that's never an excuse for rudeness!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been going here for years with friends and family for all sorts of events. Definitely a place for small or big get-togethers. Expect a wait time of at least 15 minutes, because its a small place. If you find yourself waiting for up to 30 minutes the staff will pass out complimentary pizza squares, or cheesy bread, or something of that sort, occasionally. They'll also get you and your party some drinks to start while you wait to be seated. Also expect to spend a bit more on the food, but I believe it's definitely worth it because the portion sizes of each dish, as well as the quality. The staff is super friendly and I've never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Pure Italian food freshly cooked. If you love amazing food that's a bang for your buck then this is your place. I recommend the Spaghetti with sausage and for desert their cookie with Ice cream"}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  Why is this a local favorite?  The pizza is below average at best, with crust so thin they have to cut it into small squares to be handled.  I also ordered the Chicken Parmesan with linguine.  The chicken was tough and chewy and the linguine had a grainy dry texture with very little flavor.  They don't offer small side salads for dinner, only large two person salads.  I'd eat at Carrabba's everyday of the week before going back here.  The search for good pizza in Phoenix continues."}
{"text":"In my opinion, there is no better restaurant in Phoenix than Oregano's.  Every time we have people visit us, it starts at Oregano's, and usually the Old Town location.  People are always friendly, enjoyable, happy to be there (or at least they seem to be).  We haven't had anything that we didn't enjoy, the wings are the best we've had in Arizona, all the pizzas are great and the Pizooki is friggin' awesome!"}
{"text":"8/2017: Not the best oreganos location, but good! Quick & easy. Nice staff. We've been eating at oreganos restaurants since the mid 90's & have watched them grow. When we are in town from CA we always come here 1st! A little jinsy on their Pablo Picasso salad & thin BBQ pizza this visit. Used to sizes being a bit larger at other locations, but we love Oreganos."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Sullivan was very personable and made us feel so welcome! Also very knowledgeable on menu and suggestions! Try the new handcrafted specialty drinks !! Will be back and request him !!"}
{"text":"Well, so we tried Oregano's in Flagstaff recently and we loved it. Well, we loved the sausage appetizer with lots of cheese.
Back there, we also tried the 'Join the wait list' feature from Yelp, and it worked wonders.

We get back home and hubby wanted to go to Oregano's again for dinner for us and our guests.

I checked the wait time and joined the wait list through Yelp. All the time during the drive there we were raving about how much we liked the sausage appetizer. Then we arrive at the estimated time just to be told the details in the app are not correct and there is an additional 30-35 minute wait.

That is what I call over promising and under delivering, which is usually very bad for businesses.

Needless to say we were very disappointed and did not want to wait.
We went to Olive Garden, got a booth right away and enjoyed a delicious meal with my always favorite Zuppa Tuscana.

We may give Oregano another chance but this was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Its nearly impossible to NOT be a fan of Oregano's.  Fabulous pizza (pan, thin and DEEP dish), great pasta, awesomely HUGE salads, amazing appetizers ... The wings are killer.  Get the golden italian, you will not be disappointed.  Many items on the menu have their unique Oregano's spin and combine flavors and foods you wouldn't find at your average pizza place.  For instance the GuacaToni; guacamole with oregano for an italian flair.  Not to fret, Oregano's has all the standards too if you're looking for a typical pepperoni pie.  They have gluten friendly crust, and many things are vegetarian and can be made vegan.  They do not yet have a dairy-free cheese, but I'm hopeful this might be something they add in the near future."}
{"text":"Any Phoenix native will tell you Oregano's is the pizza king of the valley.  

They do thin crust AND deep dish well.  

Many people opt for their famous Pizzookie (ice cream cookie) dessert as well.  

The only downside of this Scottsdale location is that the parking is a female dog."}
{"text":"Being new here in the area, I was looking for a nice Italian place to purchase from from time to time. I do love pasta! I tried the shrimp scampi; wayyyy to much spices and it was just over killed with it. I spent 30$ but ended up not eating half of it. I threw it away due to it not being bearable to even finish. I wasn't satisfied wit the food quality but the staff/atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Always love the food. Big Rig with Chianti and of course a pizzookie. Last time we got amazing service from a upbeat, rocking lady named Sarah and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Outstanding dining experience!  Heard about this place when we first moved to Arizona about a month ago and tried to come earlier but due to the spring training being here the line was always crazy!

Finally got to experience this past Wednesday and I can totally see why the long line. Our server, Lynnette was awesome!  Always tending to us and making sure we didn't need anything. All the while tending to all of her other tables. 

Ordered the Numero One-O pizza, garlic bread and a simple house salad that was huge! Everything came out quick and very delicious. 

my wife and I will definitely be making Oregano's a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Best pizza in phoenix hands down. Their portions are huge and the price is extremely reasonable. A must every single time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"They have TV care but it doesn't seem like it's the best reception and it is a little bit limited viewing. The staff is friendly and they the staff is friendly and they seem to be a tentative and know what they're doing. The windows were open today for the perfect breeze. The brussel sprouts seem to be a little bit under done but the manager was cordial about it and should I returned they will pay more attention to the cooking of the brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Great food! Terrible service. Food takes FOREVER to come out. Asked waiter when we ordered pizza to bring a couple sides of ranch, he forgot. Asked again, he brought one back. This isn't the first time I've had horrible service there, it feels like almost every time I go the servers can't seem to get it together. Other than that food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great prices and food. Oregano's is Da Bomb. Tight budget? Date night here is not a pocket pounder. Nice bar and patio seating. I have met the corporate chef and she is awesome and creative. The inside decor is fun and Sinatra playing in background adds to the ambiance. It's a must! #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"Decent food. Reasonable prices. But unreasonable wait times that aren't justified. I'll stand in line for hours to eat at Bianco's or Los Dos, who at least have the decency to provide us with entertainment during the wait. But I'm not going to do so for merely \"decent\" food.

EDIT: Did I mention the horrendous and extremely aggravating parking situation?"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. We are long standing customers of this establishment. We came in for lunch on 2-10-18. This  company discontinued the parmesan wings we normally order and we got wings that we're covered in gelatinous mustard goo. The wonderful antipasto salad that we normally order was a tasteless soggy mess. I think they forgot the dressing all together. So many items missing, and it seemed like the lettuce had been frozen and then thawed. The service was lacking. Sad to say I think we will not be back to Oreganos. Too many BAD changes. The service seemed to be lacking as well."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was not excited to hear a chain was coming to my town. I prefer to support local restaurants rather then large chains. I also thought the excitement about it was ridiculous, it is a PIZZA place for pete's sake! We finally went last week and had a wait for a table of about 35 minutes, but we found a seat at the bar and waited - the bartenders were awesome and told us all about the founder and the story etc. We were finally seated and I had the stuffed riga-tony and it was very good! Server was slow in getting a drink I ordered to me in time, we were ready to leave before it showed up. So, service was a little slow, but the food and atmosphere were good. I think they have some room for  improvement but we will be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza. This is a great place to eat. Dessert is the best. Get the deep dish pizza. Now it takes around 45 min to cook the deep dish pizza. But the food is great."}
{"text":"Had a great time. Bella our server was nothing short of amazing. Very personable, funny and a happy girl. The pizza was very good...the atmosphere.. Saturday afternoon....very loud and fun."}
{"text":"Yaaaaay excellent !!!

Ate here last night.  Was quoted 35 min wait and we were prepared.  We were seated in 15 minutes!  Nice size booth, wonderful atmosphere.  The food was to die for. We had Riga Tony and Zany Ziti...huge portions and so-so - so delicious. Great waiter, too! We live in Surprise and have one in Glendale but were already headed to Scottsdale for a comedy show. I'm not big on Scottsdale swank and it didn't have that feel at all :)"}
{"text":"We love this place!!! Sitting out on the patio is a must and so is the thin crust pizza. I love the huge drinks and the desserts are great also. We always meet here with some friends from the Cave Creek area."}
{"text":"So, I like the one in Scottsdale better. It just seems like they have faster and better service but the food is still really good."}
{"text":"I have attempted to go to Oregano's 5 times.  I have actually eaten here 3 times.  The food was good, the parking is terrible.  I would be able to give this place 5 stars if I didnt have to fight for parking and a table.

I just can't see people waiting so long to eat here.  What is it that lures everyone in?

Someone message me and suggest a must try dish.  I have tried the wings, which were delicious, and a couple of the sandwiches.

The wait kills me every time.  For the parking section of the review I really wanted to check the \"Yeah Right\" box.  haha."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!  Food took over 30 minutes, incl the calamari app. Then when food finally came, each persons entree came minutes apart with the soup last!  And i had to ask for an extra plate 4 times!  Server never came by to apologize for the long wait. The worst! So we got here at 7, 30 min wait for a table, food served at 8:40.

Also, they changed the Italian Wedding Soup recipe. Its awful!  And serving it in a bread bowl is asinine!"}
{"text":"You guys, it's Oregano's. Stop expecting fine dining. 
The food is borderline meh and good. 
The portion sizes are for huge fat American families. Share with each other! 
You have to wait for a table. If you don't want to wait for a table you should go somewhere else. Yes, it's often a very long wait. Very, very... Long wait time for a table. It's your choice if you want to wait or not. Don't complain about it. I'm sure every server wishes they could turn the tables faster but they can't. 
Just chill out. Have some sangria. And make sure you get a pizza cookie before you leave. YUMMAY"}
{"text":"I took my first bite of the Numero One Uno Chicago Thin Crust Pizza and thought I was in Heaven.  So this is what food tastes like when go to Heaven.  Every slice was a taste of paradise."}
{"text":"Garlic cheesy bread was amazing! Pizza was okay. Cute location and great for a date night. Staff was super friendly and the wait wasn't an issue since they offer samples and you can order drinks."}
{"text":"A very negative experience, only giving 2 stars because the food was fairly decent.  The wait to be seated was longer than we were told.  Due to a long wait to get our food, a manager by the name of Robin, came over and was exceptionally bitchy and rolling her eyes when her job was to make the customers happy.  Would never return to this particular location."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch for the first time ever with the hubby. Knew that it had to be good if a lunch crowd meant a wait for tables at 1pm. We sat at the bar and were greeted promptly by our server. Ordered from the lunch menu and ordered a pizza slice (pepperoni and portabella) and a side Caesar salad. Our food was brought out quickly. The \"lunch\" salad portion was huge enough for my husband and I to share. Pizza had the right amount of sauce and the crust was the correct thickness for my liking (thin and crisp!) Our total bill for lunch with drinks plus tip was under $30. The meal was very satisfying and we'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Had great service from Destiny she always checked on us and the food was delicious! Definitely coming again soon."}
{"text":"Awesome food, but we saw a rat outside by the seating area. The manager was advised and he took care of it."}
{"text":"I worked here for a short time three years back and just simply fell I'm love with everything about it. The playing music from the,40s,50s, very much like the Frank Sinatra era. It always reminds me of a back east eatery except they have a wonderful outdoor patio life. They have wonderful flavored salad that are gigantic they could feed probably three hungry girls! They have a very large wine list, and a full bar. You can also place reservation for large parties. I would even recommend that you place a reservations if it's Thursday Friday or Saturday because the wait can be very long if you just show up. They do serve a Chicago style pie pizza, which is to die for! They do slices of pizza if you're trying to eat light or cheap during the lunch hour. And everything is literally made fresh, with very high quality.  The only thing that ever makes me sad here is that the ladies restroom only has one stall..... Other than that there is absolutely nothing to complain about!  the price point is right, the locations are great, the atmosphere is welcoming, and it doesn't matter if it's just you or a party of 30 it is a great choice for dining out as well as pick up!"}
{"text":"if you come here I suggest you eat inside. when I called for takeout the girl kept saying \"um\" as if she didn't really know what she was doing. I arrived early, and I knew it, so I wasn't so worried about it. however, when the restaurant is dead and my order comes up and four different people look at it in the window, look at us standing there waiting for them to notice it, and not one says or does a single thing about it, I'm not pleased. even if your shift is almost done, you don't just let a take out order sit there in the window while you do your money drawer. I know this because I am a server, and I would never ignore customers or an order because I was leaving. you're still there, and you still need to help. disappointing."}
{"text":"This place has the noise. It's way too loud. You can't hear anyone talking that dines with you unless you yell. Staff are great at service though. Food took a long time to come and could not be eaten right away because of the temperature. I can't the food was good. It wasn't.  The crust was tough and the flavor awful. Oreganos is usually good just don't go to this one without ear plugs or expecting what you've experienced at another Oreganos."}
{"text":"Guac-A-Tony appetizer is Oregano's version (Italian) to Guacamole and Chips!Pretty tasty!  The portions are huge! Although they discontinued my favorite meal the eggplant sandwich they still have great salads (very filling) and of course pizza! I have yet to try their veggie sandwich.  If you like Bellini's, you will love their's! Only downfall for me (a sports enthusiast) is their is no T.V.'s for football season. I do understand that they probably want to keep it a family restaurant instead of a sports bar. Great date restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been going since the first one opened in OTS back in the day!   My hubby and I spent each birthday, anniversary and every Sunday night here!  Never a bad meal and always great service!   Relocated to Texas for 8 years and missed O's terribly!  Returned to Scottsdale for good and we are back to our old routine, just at the Scottsdale/Shea location instead!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great gathering place with the best pizza and servers in Arizona!  Always personable and talk about a salad that is a starter will take it over the top
Give it a try you will be a regular!!!"}
{"text":"There were 4 of us and we all order different things and they were all oustandingly good. We are going back."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality of pizza.  Staff was kimd of just kimd of depressing. Pizza cookies are good that's why the 2 stars"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place!

We came here for pre-race carb-loading two years in a roll before Ironman Arizona. They are very accommodating for the big groups. They also let you know the deep dish pizza will take long ahead of time so we can adjust what we want accordingly. 

Everything here comes in big size! Sharing with friends is the best way to go."}
{"text":"Where Italian and Mexican meet on the same dishes.  Nice twists on delicious food! Service was just ok, but the food's great.  Best sausages - not greasy at all, full of flavor.  The Scampi delivered big juicy shrimp and a unique garlic butter 'cilantro' sauce.  The QuacaTony is a great sharer - and the wings were meaty, yet crispy.  Meatballs are fanTASTIC, the antipasto is abundant and full of flavor.  Don't forget the half baked pizookie... but you can forget your diet :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pizza which makes me very picky when choosing a place to have pizza. Although I only have pizza maybe once a month, I absolutely love the thin crust pizza... particularly the Clark Street meat pizza (with a few extra added items). Our server, Anna, made the experience all the more worth the extra money we spent on the extra items. She was pleasant, friendly, personable & professional as well as very comfortable in her position which to me makes all the difference in my dining experience."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!! This place is absolutely wonderful. The wait services is great. The food is to die for especially the Julius Cesear salad and white chocolate macadamia nut PAZOOKIE !!!! I am have been waiting for one to open up on this side of town and YOU DID IT!!! I love u"}
{"text":"So it is the smallest Oregano's I have been to, and probably the one with the worse layout. But to finally have an Oregano's in Glendale within a 10 minute driving distance from my house is simply wonderful.  

Thus far, we have been lucky to have no wait.  We also get decent service every time.  And they usually have one or two decent beer on tap like something from Lagunitas or Four Peaks. Would love it if they can add more craft brews. 

We had ordered the Big Beefstro salad, and it was not worth it.  But salad, beer, and pizza does not really make sense, so I say skip the salads.  Its always a bit of a wait for their pizza, so you might wanna order an appetizer + a pitcher of beer and just have glut fest.  That is why you are here right? 

Me and my hubby seem to always get the same pizza.  We have tried others but most of the time we get the Hawaiian style with an add of roasted garlic.  This and a pitcher of good beer = winning combo."}
{"text":"This is such a good spot to eat. As soon as you walk in the door you are greeted by friendly smiles. I love the customer service  this Oregano's has. The complaint I have is the wait time to sit and eat and if you sit inside it's ALWAYS freezing, other than that I love multiple items on the menu. If you haven't been here you should try it."}
{"text":"Called today 2/16/18 to order 2 pizza to go at 5:15pm. Was told would be 2 hour to get pizza because of Valentine day. Need too get there S*** together will never be back. Ordered pizza on super bowel Sunday and was picked up in a hour. When picked up said sorry ran out of peepers for pizza. Well than should have discounted opizza or sent someone to store BAD MANAGEMENT"}
{"text":"Ive never been a fan of this place but some friends were going there and invited us to come with them.. what the hell, right?

The service is pretty good here.. very attentive and friendly. Ordered the spinach salad, the dressing was really weird, like a miso dressing with bacon.. didn't work at all. Also ordered a Frisco pizza, thin crust. Well the outer perimeter of the pizza was so dried out that those pieces were just about inedible. Maybe that's how they do it here? I don't remember the pizza's being that dry? The wings were good enough.. plenty of meat and not greasy at all. 

I wouldn't go come back to Oregano's unless some friends were going and I was invited. You would have been proud of me, I didn't complain at all!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, definitely worth the wait at least once.  Usually a long wait for dinner (even during the week).  Amazing thin crust cheese pizza.  Great staff that remembers us even though we live in California.  You MUST try the Original Pizza Cookie!  There are other Oregano's locations throughout AZ, but this is the one we've been to the most.  We go here every time we're in AZ.  Great atmosphere, totally relaxed.  We'd definitely invest in one of these if they came out to California!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to go! The big rig pasta is the best! Get the sausage, and if you are feeling a salad the big beefstro salad is amazing! The pizza cookie is also amazing!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on the way to the airport.  We just ordered pizza and its delish! It's thin square cut.  It's so good you just keep eating till you are stuffed.   Our waiter was really attentive and even offered to go cups.  I think no matter which location you go to expect a wait.  It's so worth it!  I will be back their pasta and sandwiches look awesome as well!"}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! It's a casual place you can sit inside or outside and their food is amazing!!! I love their Oreganos original salad, all their pizzas, and their Bellinis are delicious! Their apps are amazing too."}
{"text":"First of all, the was my first visit to Oregano's.  We were here as a going away party . The restaurant does not seat incomplete parties, beware. When I arrived the party was complete and the waitress stated it would be about 15 to 20 minutes for seating. 40 minutes later one of the group members inquired as to why there were empty tables that could not be connected or put together for a large group party. The response given was the manager did not like to do it that way. This is confusing to us. Within about 5 to 8 minutes of that inquiry two tables were connected at the back of the patio seating and we were all seated at that time. The waitress came over introduced herself gave everyone menus as expected. From then on the night just got longer and longer. Everyone was ready to order and finally the waitress returned to take the orders. The menu offered various items that appeal to just about everyone.  The variety on the menu was great. The wings were my favorite. We also had the calamari and the bruschetta. My husband does not usually like bruschetta but he found this version particularly satisfying. The prices on the menu appeared to be rather on the high side. However upon review to be rather on the high side. 

Due to the food being excellent in quality and taste and the portions being large enough for two to share, this is the reason for the 3 star rating.

The waitress who was attending our large group of 12 was of sub par quality. When I asked for a large knife to be able to cut the goodbye cake. Within 5 minutes she came back and responded the manager does not like to give out the chef's knives to patrons. This again confused me. So I cut the large cake with a table butter knife.

I was very very disappointed with the service of the staff.  

I will visit Oregano's again. However, I will visit a different location."}
{"text":"Well it has been sometime since our last visit.   This time All 3 of us were disappointed a little. We ordered a 1/2 &1/2 large thin crust pizza. The waitress did not explain that to customize a pizza was an upcharge. The pizza was burned on its edges and soggy in the middle. The wings were good, very consistent. Not much to brag about.  A large pizza, 1 dozen wings and 3 drinks, 52.00..  wow!!!  I really could have gone elsewhere for less money and better pizza. Maybe next time.. ummmm. Not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I do not usually give 5 stars!  This place is awesome!   Food is fresh, many varieties to choose from. More than enough to share!!!  Service was exceptional! !"}
{"text":"The patio was an awesome place to enjoy a meal. The staff was exceedingly accommodating, pleasant, and a huge positive.  The brussels sprouts were very good. The pizza crust was terrible. In fact, nasty. Horrible. The pizza itself was such a conglomeration of tastes that it simply became white noise on my taste buds. I do not know that I would go back, but my table mates seemed satisfied and content. That said, they were both on the younger side with it with young tastebuds."}
{"text":"This is a local Arizona institution, so I am scared to give it 3 stars...but dammit, this site is about honesty, right? 

My brother has tried to take me to an Oregano's for a while, but there is always an insane wait at whatever one we have attempted. Since it was an early weekday afternoon, I suggested this new one in Mesa since there was bound NOT to be a wait-and we were right!

We entered and this place is pretty spacious. They asked if we wanted to eat at the bar-but to tell the truth it looked like on of the most unappealing bars I had ever seen. It reminded me of the Barbie's McDonald play set I had as a kid. Plastic-y and just kind of kitchy-and not in the good way. No thanks. We were led through the restaurant and I have to admit it reminded me of a Pizza Hut. Hmm... we opted for outside but kind of regreted it since it was hot out and the misters didn't do much.

The table was kind of large and I felt like my bro and I were at a conference table waiting for a terribly important meeting. The host was friendly and wanted our drink order kind of fast-but since it was my first time, I told him that. He then proceeded to tell me ALL the drinks. I mean ALL of them. I wished I had kept my mouth shut and just found the last page of the menu that listed drinks, since he proceeded to list them off verbatim. While he sat at our table. Kind of awkward. Am I being too east coast about this? After all that, got a Fat Tire and then proceeded to look over the menu. As a vegetarian and lactose intolerant, going to Italian restaurants is kind of dumb for me, I admit. I mean I can eat pizza, but it just doesn't bode well. 

I settled for the Pasta Basta, penne with feta cheese, pine nuts, olives, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and with a slice of garlic bread. It was a little spicy, but pretty tasty and not a bad deal for 8 bucks. I had some left over and the garlic bread toasted well the day after.

I just wasn't super impressed. It was a good solid restaurant, one you could bring grandman, your ma, a study group, kids, whatever, which is nice, right? But I found the service to be way too familiar and way too friendly (which sounds crazy, and trust me, I didnt think that was possible until I went here). I understood finally why children are scared of clowns after coming here. Someone being overly nice and cheerful is just kind of eerie."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our experience here. We went to dine-in on a Sunday afternoon and while although there was about a 20-30 minute wait, the area outside was nice, we had a glass of wine and enjoyed ourselves. (If you are really hungry, get on the waiting list on yelp before you go!)
When we were finally seated, our table was in the back of the restaurant, so we got to walk through nearly the entire restaurant. Very cool decor, very different, and eye catching, but very cool. I really liked the feeling inside the restaurant. 
We were greeted by our smiling server, who did provide excellent service all the way through. 
The food was very good. I say 4 out of 5, maybe because I grew up eating authentic Italian food, so my standards are high, but you will enjoy the food. I got the shroom boom pasta (pictured below) and added a sausage and meatball. I wasn't expecting an entire piece of sausage, but it was tasty. The meatball was top notch. We also started with the boom dip, which was also amazing (not the healthiest) but AMAZING. My husband had El diablo shrimp pasta, added like me, a sausage and a meat ball, and although not usually a pasta lover, enjoyed his meal. He said he would order again. 
We like having this spot in the neighborhood and plan to visit very soon. It just really seems like the perfect Sunday place for us, as Sunday's are reserved for carbs, and lots of them!"}
{"text":"Oh hh yea!!! I can't tell you how good this place is with words. But it will try! My wife had the artichoke lasagna!!! SUPERB!!! I had the this crust pizza, also awesome. It pales in comparison to the artichoke lasagna!! This is a must try! We love the oreganos, they are also in our home town. But the new menu items are dynamic!! My wife also loves the pizza Cookie. She gets the white chocolate chip macadamia! Brianna did a great job despite the major crowd they had."}
{"text":"First let me say the portions this place serves are HUGE. My first visit here was with my boss for a lunch meeting. I ordered the pesto pasta bowl. YUMMY. I ate as much as I could and still had enough for lunch again the next day. My kids loved the bread bowl. I had the happy ending infamous cookie dough ice cream. Loved it all. I will have to bring my kids with me next time I visit because I see that they give the kids pizza dough to play with while they wait for their food."}
{"text":"Why is it that Oregano's always has small buildings with little elbow room? This isn't Italy.
This Oregano's blows compared to the Tempe/Scottsdale one and they're not that much better.
Poor service, food is a little off and the building is too damn small. 
Might as well go to Olive Garden or Buca di Beppo and have an enjoyable lunch/dinner.
Plus they're overpriced due to the valley's sick obsession with Oregano's."}
{"text":"Gotta love the Pizzookie and the Dirty Monkey!! So worth the wait!! Legalize Marinara!!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner last night and had an amazing dining experience with our server Kelsey. Often going to a restaurant straight from work in work clothes + a 3 year old you get seated poorly and less than great service. This was not the case tonight Kelsey was attentive had amazing recommendations on food and which drinks were popular. She really did a thorough job waiting on us. Our salads and appetizer were huge and tasted great."}
{"text":"Had the numero one-o.....the cheese is amazing and the pizzas are delicious.  Great service by a friendly staff and a uniquely decorated interior.  Glad I tried it out."}
{"text":"First time here, 10/10 would come again. Our server was really energetic and super helpful."}
{"text":"I went here with my dad and we both loved it! We both ordered the Bollo Pasta (free refills!) and ate until we were completely stuffed. The restaurant environment is great, it feels cozy and personal, and the staff were very helpful and attentive. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Can't go wrong. Tried the deep dish pizza. TIP: This Place is really busy allow 45 min to an hour for your pizza order (carry out). No delivery."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a place that is good EVERY time, but the is one of those spots. Pizza, pasta, salads, appetizers, whatever, it's all good! Some of the best iced tea in town too.
And, do yourself a favor and see if you can sit where Don is the server. He is amazing at his job, and makes the experience even better. He makes great suggestions, not only for what to have there, but also on how to make any leftovers be almost as good as it was when you were at the table."}
{"text":"I LOVE Oregano's pizza- their thin crust pizza that is. We had a nice dinner on the patio with the misters going. The reason why this wasn't a 5 star review is because we were placed by a large group of middle school- aged children (and they were being extremely loud and one scooted his chair out and almost ran into my mother)- the restaurant itself really couldn't do much since we were outside other than placing us at a different location or saying something to the kids. Our server was very friendly and empathetic to what was going on and brought us our pitcher of beer very quickly! Also, the misters were dripping all over us, our table, and our food.. it probably would've been a good idea to leave the umbrellas up even at night time since this occurred. We love Oregano's and plan on going back- probably best to sit inside though!!"}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner was good, but not as great as the service.  The calamari was not good, but the steak salad was.  If you don't like spicy, make sure to ask.  We ordered the thin crust meat something pizza and it was excellent, but we were too full from the calamari, salad and beer.  We ordered a small salad and pizza and they were both medium at best.

Now to the service, the hostess was very nice and receptive to our needs.  The bartender was awesome as well.  The one that took the cake was our server, Sierra, she took great care of us for any need that we had and did a great job of keeping the flow of our dinner going.  Whether if we needed drinks, apps or the next course of food Sierra was always there.  She also took the time and chatted with us about all of our food decisions, which really helped out."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Oreganos', Has been difficult to get in due to it being a new restaurant in Surprise. Another Chain so nothing new really. I had their Moms Sausage and Peppers, with a table sized Mac and Cheese Penne Pasta, and my Wife had Oreganos Favorite Salad. The food is very tasty with an excellent price and huge servings. Drinks a little on the spendy side with a Long Island ringing in at $9. It is definitely a great value for families which makes it by nature a very loud restaurant. We sat out on the patio which was insane loud. That's fine if your with friends tossing a few back but if you are looking for a place for a civil conversation keep driving east on Bell road for Babbo's
For this reason I can't see us returning any time soon unless we have visitors"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I crave it! Always the best experience with the take out orders! Food very fresh and service is also great!"}
{"text":"My son took me here last night for my birthday. Even with a packed house, we were seated in about 10 minutes. I really like the check in system where they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. We had an order of the medium wings and a large, thin crust pepperoni pizza. Both were pretty dang good. The best part was dessert.  We had a pizzuki; a half baked cookie in a small pan pizza dish, topped with vanilla ice cream. It was amazing!  Our waitress was fantastic. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is simply the best pizza I've ever eaten. And when they advertise thin crust, they mean paper thin. Crispy deliciousness.
We had the, classic bistro and the pepperoni sausage. Both tasted great. We called ahead for pick-up, and the pizzas were ready at the time promised.
Pizza here is sliced into squares."}
{"text":"again....the freaking pizza cookie. how can you not just fade away into bliss when eating this thing....it it it it is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"The Original Pizza Cookie!?  There's no better way to celebrate your birthday than a delicious 1/2 pound of chocolate chip, peanut butter chocolate, or white chocolate macadamia nut cookie dough baked a topped with three scoops of vanilla ice cream!  Well, there is, but only with Oregano's as a part of your special day (especially as it is FREE on your birthday).  

Funny thing...I went to Oregano's last night and didn't even get the Original Pizza Cookie.  That is because I was filled up on a salad and pizza, both shared with a friend.  My friend and I enjoyed a delicious Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad (with chicken in it) though apparently then can substitute pinto beans for chicken for vegetarians.  If there's just two of you, get the Jr. instead of the full salad as it is already HUGE as a Jr.  

We also ordered a pan pizza with several toppings.  We were warned that it would take 45-60 minutes for the pizza to come out and were pleased to see it show up in a half hour.  Delicious but quite filling pizza!  Made for great leftovers though.  

I have also enjoyed thin crust pizzas and several of the bottomless pastas in the past.  While sometimes the wait times can be longer than other times, the estimated wait times are usually pretty accurate.  Parking at the Paradise Valley location is a breeze!  Definitely a pizza place that visitors to Phoenix should go to regardless of which location, as it is only an Arizona chain."}
{"text":"First time to this location. Was amazed by the customer service every detail covered and taking care of. First order of calamari was over done replace with out asking. Second order was good. Had the \"Big Rig\" and Baked Ziti at table. Big potions, reasonably priced, and food was very good, but service was the best part of it all!!!
Will return again"}
{"text":"I have been going to Oreganos all over AZ since  i can remember starting with the first location in downtown Scottsdale. Every location the quality food is consistent and amazing. If you are not a patient person order your pie like a hour ahead but honestly if you dont it is always worth the wait. There pan pizza is the best in all of AZ. I have tried so many pizza places here and yet to have something better. I would gladly challenge anyone on it. There other food is delicious as well the wings of fire are workout a doubt one of my favorite wings always crunchy and not to greasy. 

Finally the pizookie $4.99 for a incredibly satisfying dessert for atleast two. Way worth it, money aside unless you are some freak who likes a hard cookie with ice cream you will love this. So many flavors and you can get half and half. 

Overall the pizza is heaven but i have come here even just for the dessert or wings."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. It has the best pizza and great atmosphere. I've been to 3 of the locations and it's always consistent with taste and atmosphere. The service is the best I've ever seen. I love the pizza and they have my favorite salad in the world called The Big Beefstro, it's spicy and you can't get this anywhere else. LOVE IT! And the Belleni's are delicious. We went to Grimaldi's over the weekend and it was not as good as Oregano's, and it was way over priced. If you are looking for casual dining, with great service, atmosphere, excellent food and beverage, this is the place to go. The service is best I've ever seen and it won't break your savings account. My question is when are they going to go National so I can tell my friends who don't live in Arizona about this place?"}
{"text":"Had a delicious Gibbilini Bellini, then we had toasted ravioli, boom dip and a not so small Pablo Picasso salad. Whoa!!!! Yummy."}
{"text":"I was disgusted by their customer service. I ordered a deep dish pizza and had to wait an hour for pick up, then got there early just in case and had to wait ten minutes just for them to talk to me. They went to check on my pizza and had to wait another ten minutes for them to come back and tell me they gave my pizza away to another table. They offered to start a new one, or give us the pizza the other table ordered. No thank you. They didn't do anything else. Bullshit!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the delicious food (big food, reasonably priced) and the friendly, attentive service earns Oregano's top marks from me. 

Saturday night - 20 minute wait in their large waiting area was do-able for my first time here. The seating hostess went OUT OF HER WAY to make us comfortable and came by and chatted while we waited. When does that ever happen? Almost never.

The waiter was first rate and received an appropriate tip - but it was the food that really earned five stars. A \"big\" house salad and a 12 inch pizza usually couldn't ever get 5 stars from me but the food (dinner for two) was something like $23. And the pizza was large, the thin crust was perfectly made and the toppings were generous and delicious.

Five stars well earned."}
{"text":"Wow!  The amount of food we got for the price was amazing.  Huge, freshly made portions made doggie bags a must.  Service was also outstanding."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. The food was 20 minutes later than what the pick up time was. They forgot part of my order. Not to mention it was the worst tasting pizza I have had in years."}
{"text":"After over an hour wait we were seated at a table that had large vents blowing down. Very uncomfortable. The food was good but the wait after we finally placed our order was excruciatingly long."}
{"text":"Amazing! 

We came here from a recommendation from a local family member. The food was AMAZING! Service was fast. 

As soon as you walk in, you can smell the deliciousness! I had the pesto pizza. It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. 

Servings are big, so go hungry!!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of people who say that Oregano's has sub-par pizza. It's pizza. It's not supposed to be a party in your mouth. It's just pizza. And at Oregano's, it's good. They've got some okay pasta and some nice sandwiches, but if anything, you want to hit this place up for the Pizza Cookie dessert, which IS a party in your mouth: half-baked cookie dough with a dollop of ice cream on top in a pizza deep dish. It's fantastic. 

I'm also partial to some of their salads. Great theme and ambiance, and the college-aged staff makes an effort not to seem too much like college-aged staff. 

However, it's crowded and loud, which is a nice environment if you're just hanging with friends or on a date with the wife. Bringing kids is a bit of a nightmare because of the long wait times and the claustrophobic rage it puts my kids into. They do give the kids a coloring thing and a lob of pizza dough to play with. Great touches, but just touches. It's like trying to put out a forest fire with a truckload of water. It'll help for all of a minute, and in the end you still have to clean up the truck wreckage."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love what feels like about 5 pounds of melted mozzarella on a chunky tomato sauce and delicious deep dish crust? This was our second trip to Oregano's, and we weren't able to finish the large cheese pie either time. We even brought a third person along to help us this time! The good news is that the leftovers are delicious at home. Perhaps the problem is that we start with a Very Big Caesar salad and extra anchovies. Nyah, how could a big salad be a problem? We'll be back, and we will keep trying to finish this pie!"}
{"text":"I was contacted by a GM and apologized for the order problems. It was really nice. I wanted to give it another go, so I recently tried it. Unfortunately the service was pretty much the same. I feel like they are just too busy to accommodate everyone. My girlfriend LOVES Oregano's and swears by it. She loves the cookie dessert and pastas. She says you have to go early or its always like that. They go super early or late. I just dont have the patience for it. I do appreciate the GM's offer to come back. That is why they get 3 stars for good customer service.  
The parking lot had the same problem, I did find a spot on the street this time, which was easier. 
I will be back, because of the GM's attitude and really went out of their way.
 I would give it a try for new yelp readers, stick to pasta and garlic bread (what they are known for and I tried this past time). You can seriously share a dinner, its giant and tastes good."}
{"text":"We don't even bother going to other places for pizza anymore these days, for two reasons: the pizza here is really good, and the pizza cookie (but we'll get to that).  

The BBQ chicken pizza here is incredible and we never pass it up when we're here.  Sometimes we'll branch out and try something else in addition - the Lawrence's Original is good and a nice contrast to the BBQ, although the tomato sauce is pretty salty.  We've also tried the Rosemary chicken, the mushroom pizza, and the meat pizza (another standout) and those were good too.  My father-in-law swears by the wings.  The drinks here are good - I especially recommend sangria or a mimosa.  They're not stingy with the alcohol, either. ;)

But the REAL reason to come here is for the pizza cookie.  I wish there were words to describe how good it is.  Whenever I see a cookie sundae type thing on a menu I'm obligated to try it.  I have had pizza cookies near and far.  Never once have I had one that could remotely compare to the Oregano's version.  It's the best dessert I've ever had, hands down.  Sometimes I luck out and my husband is too full to help me finish much of it - rest assured, no matter what, none of it gets wasted.  Sometimes I find myself looking up pictures of their pizza cookies online like a teenager furtively checking out the centerfold in a girlie magazine.  They're that good.  So anyway, give this place a try if you haven't yet!  And save room for the cookie at the end!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff! Will definitely come back when visiting Chandler! Love the pizza! Love the pasta! Love the drinks!"}
{"text":"If you want deep dish pizza, this is a solid pie.  The thin crust is not the way to go here."}
{"text":"Reminds me of northeast real Italian cooking, friendly and efficient staff, generous portion size. Good prices. Looking forward to trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"This place delicious! We had garlic bread, the Picasso salad and chicken Parmesan. The flavors were fantastic and we got FULL"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Garlic bread some of the best I've ever had. Pesto Penne Bake some of the most flavorful pesto I've had"}
{"text":"four stars because the server was awsome ,food was ok wait was to long 35 min just to get in . food took awhile as well .."}
{"text":"I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try, so why not.

I'll tell you \"Why NOT\"... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that. More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.

That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.

Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!

It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced \"gourmet\" pizza joint.

If you want expensive, and good, pizza there are many good alternatives... Pizzeria Bianco, Grimaldi's, etc."}
{"text":"No one should wait 45 min to eat pizza. Even if you call ahead you still wait. If you havce all night to wait to eat this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Best wings in town! Italian Gold!
I stop in on Saturday afternoons and sit at the bar with Cari. She is so nice and helpful. She recommended the Italian Gold wings. JACKPOT!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service! Staff is always friendly and very polite! My family and I have been coming to Oreganos in Surprise since they opened."}
{"text":"Consistently good. Every. Single. Time. We've been to several locations and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"i hated the few months of living in Tempe and going to asu. the only two things that made living there worthwhile were two things:
oregano's deep dish pizza           and                  sonic!
i am picky with pizza and their deep dish is so good that it is worth waiting an hour just to get seated, and then waiting another 25 minutes for it to get made. really cute waiters here and nice decor. the only thing i hate about this place is the wait. if you really don't want a wait, come before noon which is crazy because who really wants to eat something so heavy that early?"}
{"text":"Place was just ok. The prices were a bit expensive and the food wasn't worth it. The wait was very long."}
{"text":"Great Food and Great Service.  Our go to restaurant in Cave Creek!!

Service is top notch and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Oregano's has the best thin crust pizza and antipasto salad in Arizona. Hands down. All there other dishes are delicious as well! The atmosphere is fun and completely fits the restaurant. They also have a nice outside patio area. This isn't a cheap to-go/delivery pizza place, it is a sit down Italian restaurant so expect prices that match with it. Since the food is so amazing, there is almost always a wait. But the wait is worth it! Just try to plan ahead of you don't want to wait an hour. The service speed is average, which is again due to the fact that it's always busy. The waiters and waitresses are usually very friendly, and do there absolute best to help you. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Always busy but so worth the wait. Huge portion sizes! Atmosphere is great, indoor seating is a little snug, but the outdoor patio is great and I love the outdoor bar too! Pizza is so incredible!"}
{"text":"An exceptional value.  This place also has a room inside for small private events.  Just went there for my friends 50th birthday and I was surprised by the private space.  A good selection for a private party buffet.  Much better than I had expected!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at this establishment last week. What a good time we had with our wonderful waitress Tiffany. She took fabulous care of us, very attentive and the food was outstanding! Can't wait to go back again. This might very well be my favorite place to eat. Well, as long as Tiffany is there to take care of us."}
{"text":"If you don't consider your time valuable, don't know what good food is, and you're willing to throw good money away at terrible food, then this is your place.  I would never have come here, if not invited by the Churchill's, but that's a different story.  I ordered a pizza for lunch, and it took 45 minutes of waiting for a pizza that turned out to be the saltiest pizza I've ever had.  It was almost inedible.   Won't be coming back, even if they paid me!!"}
{"text":"Getting more & more disappointed wit this place. Finally seated after a 45 minute wait. You would think management would have at least one of the three hostesses circulate among the waiting patrons offering water service when the temp is 104 outside.  NOPE! I guess they  can't think that far out if the box about customer care. Then next in line for our party of 5 & see a party of 3 seated at a booth that can easily accommodate 6.  Really Oregano's? Your food is okay at best but not worth the poor standards of managements lack of vision."}
{"text":"One of the business managers had messaged me regarding my review and even offered me a gift card, that was very nice of him to do so and that's the only reason I'm giving them four stars for good customer service, you don't see that often."}
{"text":"The Puerto Peñasco deep dish was the most horrible pizza I've tasted! The  chicken wings were serve cold. The pasta was served cold. All around horrible dinner."}
{"text":"Visiting from California...Amazing. Best lunch. Rachel was a fantastic server. Sausage had just enough kick, the bruschetta is a new favorite and the pomegranate margos were amazing. Thank you! Rachel even made sure our drinks were put into to go containers."}
{"text":"Food was great, was a busy Friday night and food came quick. Waitress was nice but definitely felt like she didn't want to be there and was very rushed. Table next to us had the friendliest waitress tho so we'll try again!"}
{"text":"THIS is legit!!! We ordered the garlic bread for appetizer with marinara sauce and the marinara was a little chunky for my liking however it was still delicious.... my friend got the bollo pasta (endless refills) with meatballs and this was delicious and served with fresh Parmesan cheese... the meatballs were huge, juicy and delicious... I ordered the deep dish pizza TAKES 45 MINUTES to cook just FYI and it was full of cheese meat and sauce and the crust was perfectly cooked--- ORDER THE DEEPDISH=magnificently scrumptious.. we ended the dinner with the original pizza cookie and even though I was about to pop, I made room and it too was delicious.... STUPEFACENTE... also the waiter kept my tea full for about 7 refills"}
{"text":"Our family loves oreganos! Their salads are sooo good and the pizza is to die for! My 2 favorite go to's are: 

Alfredo the Dark pasta with chicken - Creamy and spicy alfredo sauce with big curly noodles, and a nice fire roasted chili on top. 

Thin crust cheese pizza - Add some freshly grated parm and the red chili oil from the condiment tray on the table... so simple, but damn is it amazing! 

But the most amazing thing ON THIS PLANET is the pizzookie.. when you get that first bite of warm gooey cookies, and cold creamy ice cream, you will think you died and gone to heaven. And it's free on your birthday!!!

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is hit or miss with the services. 1/2 the time the waiter/waitress is amazing and totally on their game. The other 1/2 of the time we would wait 30 minute for our check, 20 minutes for refills, ask repeatedly for condiments or utesils. But being right across the street from ASU i bet the turn around there is crazy. And the parking lot it tiny, there have been a few times we circled and circled for 10 minutes and never found a spot and were forced to eat somewhere else.

All in all, amazing food at decent prices :) Highly recommend for families or friendly get togethers."}
{"text":"We ordered the Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato pizza for take out but when we got home we found out we were given a plain cheese pizza instead. Upon calling Oreganos to inform them of the slip up they apologized for the mistake but were unable to correct the order because the kitchen was closed. They said they would just mail us a gift card to make up for the error. Well when we received the gift card the balance was less than what we had payed for the speciality pizza we never received. Oreganos is still a quality restaurant, but a successful establishment such as them could have at least spotted the original cost of the order."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying the Pizza and service are spectacular, five stars for those!  Why am I writing this and only giving one star? 

For stupidity!

If the manager gave us a reasonable explanation then you wouldn't see this.

My mother ordered two shots of vodka on the rocks.  She requested two olives in it... Not an unreasonable request.  The bartender came over to the table and said \"we don't have whole olives, will sliced be ok?\"  Huh? A bar without whole olives? Perhaps they ran out?  Ok sure my mother said she would try sliced.

Presentation of the drink sucked...it came in a pint glass with the ice way above the vodka, no stir stick, and the olives? Were in a rocks glass, they weren't even queen olives, they were small sliced olives like you get on a pizza.  But I am not writing about the presentation of the drink.

We got the bill for our drinks, 2-16 inch pizzas, a 12 inch pizza a Pazookie and...here it comes 2 olives!  No shit! They charged us for condiments!  We had to ask why, as we have never been charged for having a lime in a beer, or 5 cherries in my daughters Shirley Temples, or olives anywhere in the world! The bartender never mentioned and extra charge for sliced olives. $0.39 each!

Now $6 a shot for vodka not unreasonable, even for rail! I am not upset about the $12 drink. The slap in the face is the charge for olives, that were not even whole!
  
So the manager (Carrie?) comes over and gives us some BS story that other places have figured the cost of the olives into their drink prices so that is why we have never ever seen this before anywhere in the world.  

Hmmmm, how do those places know how many olives we are going to ask for? Or limes, or oranges or cherries.  You know I used three squirts of soap and three squares of hand towels when I used their restroom did I go over my limit on those? Think I should go back and have them add it to the bill? 

I am only writing this because I was not satisfied with the reason given to me by the manager.  My mother ordered a $12 rail drink (not call) and had to pay for condiments. STUPID!

Dear Mark Russell,
You have awesome people, great food, and service, however you need not charge for olives in drinks... Kind of stupid. Right?"}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe how much this place has gone down. We used to eat here at least once a week (over a year ago) and since then, they have raised their prices, made their portions smaller, and seemed to have changed a few recipes (and it's not an improvement). Today we thought we would give it a shot again and sat in our booth for over 15 minutes with only a tea (that tasted like it was made yesterday). We got no service in those entire 15 minutes. So not only have the prices gone up, portions become smaller, BUT now we can't even place an order within the first 15 minutes. The sad thing is that it wasn't even busy - no wait and many empty booths/tables. It's such a shame to see such a great place go down in flames with so many other competitive options in the nearby area."}
{"text":"I don't understand the wait times around the valley for Oregano's.  While the service was great and everyone was friendly, the pizza tasted like someone accidently doubled the salt content.  I now have my sodium fix for the week.  Perhaps we just got the one pizza that didn't make it out quite right, but it will most likely prevent me from going back.  After a couple pieces of the thin crust, it was barely edible.  At least we always had full glasses of water, as they were needed.  Our server was great."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now. The first time server was great. Very attentive. However, today my coworker and I came in for lunch and our server Tony was extremely rude. He dropped off my food and didn't give me a fork no napkins no plates. Nothing. Andrew came over and offered to give pepper and the bartender also took the tip to bring us napkins and forks. Maybe he thought that we weren't going to tip because of how young we look or what his issue was. I did nothing to deserve that lack of service. I work in a restaurant. I would have been fired if I gave that lack of service."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Oreganos like everyone else. I have tried numerous menu items --recommended fan favorites and freestyling with my own selection -- and I always wind up disappointed. That said, one of my very favorite people loves this place and, what I think I finally figured out is, he orders the right thing (and it's not exactly \"Italian\"). So, from now on, when I go to Oregano's, I'm getting what he gets: Alfredo The Dark with chicken. I had been reluctant because I'm not a white sauce gal, but the sauce application is actually relatively light and the cheese is more pronounced. The poblano and southwestern cheese blend are what set this dish apart. ($8.99) 

Of course, the pizookie is (almost) always a hit. They do need a few more minutes than they think in the new, faster ovens, though..."}
{"text":"Dined at Oregano's last night and had the most horrendous service in my life.  When inquiring about the wait for our pizza the female bartender barked at us and said that sausage takes 30 minutes.  She continueed to be rude and argumentive to us and after requesting the manager (young lady) the bartender continued her rudeness.  The manager went to check on our pizza and said \"it's only been 26 minutes\".  Well young lady, is that 26 minutes after the inept bartender put our order in the POS or was it 26 minutes after we ordered it.  Ever think about that?  Then the bartender's regulars had to pipe up and defend her rudeness.  My money will spend the same at any of the numerous choices aroung PV Mall, but won't be doled out at this place anymore.  For a place that wants to be \"your neighborhood joint\", their hospitality is lacking."}
{"text":"The food is really good . Not so much worth the wait though . If your hungry expect to be sitting a long time before your food is ready."}
{"text":"We always love this place no matter what, I always get the big rig, love the spicy pasta, but this time wife and sister talked me into the Oregano Salad which was super and did the classic pizza and chicken pesto pizza.  Both good but the classic i liked better, was lighter, the chicken pesto was a bit too heavy for me.  But way toooo much food for only 5 adults we got a 16\" and 18\"   way too much.  And finished it off with the famous pizza cookie ( 2 of them )  and it was amazing as always, that's what brought us in the 1st place ;)"}
{"text":"I really can't believe the positive reviews that I have read on this place.  My family and I ordered a thin crust pepperoni pizza.  After waiting 35 minutes for the pizza to arrive, and numerous assurances from the staff after the 20-minute mark that it was coming out \"in a few minutes\", the pizza itself was an epic disappointment.  Seriously on par with a bad frozen pizza!  It was sliced in those silly small squares, which makes it awkward to handle.  The toppings easily slipped off when trying to take a bite or when cutting it with knife and fork, which leads to a generally poor pizza-eating experience, at a minimum, and a burned roof-of-mouth to boot.  The crust was thin and crispy throughout, something like an bad, unsalted saltine cracker.  Honestly I can't in my 45 years of eating pizza think of a worse restaurant pizza.  Two take-home messages here - poor service and historically bad pizza.  Wish I had gone to NYPD Pizza across the parking lot - no way could it have been nearly as bad."}
{"text":"Nice setting - super thin crust pizza for my first visit. Plenty of Cheese and toppings. Will try the stuffed crust next time but It takes 50-60 min. Beer selection adequate. Tv's but don't get any channels so you are watching black and white pbs shows."}
{"text":"Most overrated place in Gilbert for 2008 goes to Oregano's. The pizza sucks. The pastas are great. Especially the 6 inch Ravioli. The hostess and wait staff have been sometimes rude and annoying. If you want pizza, go to Grimaldi's. Because this place is so overrated, there is always an ungodly wait to be seated. Don't even waste your time. There are better places."}
{"text":"I love it here! I eat here a few times a month because it's so yummy and I've always gotten good service!"}
{"text":"I was just thinking about the evolution of the pizza place as a hangout.  When you are a kid, you can't wait to go to Chuck E. Cheese for some peperoni pizza and some fun-tivities.  When you get older, you go to a local chain pizza place for a cheap dinner with friends or a cheap date.  When you start making money, you opt for some organic, gluten-free, fair-trade, new-age pizza joint where a 12'' pie will cost you $60.  Oregano's falls somewhere in between #2 and #3.

The place itself is tiny, so get ready to wait.  And wait.  And wait a little more.  I am not certain whether you can make reservations over the phone, but I know that you can stop by and tell the host you want a table for six at 8 pm.  That's what we did.  If the weather is nice, you can sit outside in the back section of the Oregano's parking lot.  They rope off a few parking spots, put up some giant umbrellas for shade and ambiance, bring out the best washable red-and-white checkered tablecloths and . . . voila!  You've got yourself an outdoor seating area. 

While you're waiting for the pizza, why not order their signature drink, the Bellini.  It is not the traditional Italian Bellini, which, I believe, is made with white peach puree and Prosecco.  The Oregano's Bellini could be best described as a slushee with cheap alcohol.  The flavors are unrecognizable, but somehow it works.  It's the kind of a drink that is much more likely to give you a brain freeze and a sugar rush instead of a buzz or a hangover.  We had to wait for our Bellini for a good 20 minutes because the slushee machine was on the fritz.

For the six of us, we ordered two extra large (18'') thin crust pizzas, a BBQ Chicken and a Hawaiian pizza.   The pizzas arrived promptly on gigantic aluminum trays . . . just like pizzas should be served in a place like Oregano's.  The pizzas were cut up into small squares, making it ideal for sharing.  Also, eating 20 little squares of pizza eliminates the guilt associated with eating several slices of pizza.  That's a huge bonus.

The pizza itself wasn't the best I've ever had, but it wasn't the worst, either.  The crust was crunchy and delicious.  The toppings were just OK, and I was not impressed with the feta/mozzarella cheese combo that topped the BBQ chicken pizza.  A couple of my friends complained that the Hawaiian pizza toppings tasted moldy, but I didn't think so at all.  Of course, I think that pineapples belong in a fruit cocktail, not next to Canadian bacon.  

Our waiter looked like a struggling college student who worked at Oregano's part time.  He was nice with just a slight hint of ambivalence.  He tried to make jokes, almost trying to \"fit in\" with our group.  It was cute in a way, although I did sense a slight hint of desperation and trying-too-hard-ness.

Overall, it's a good place to spend time with your friends and relive your high school years, when hanging out at your local pizza parlor was cool.  We left Oregano's very full, even though we left a few little pizza squares on the table.  When I got back to the hotel, I got the urge to get started on my Algebra homework . . ."}
{"text":"This location is great as far as customer service, food quality, and the set up is super cute. On my last visit parking was easy and there was no wait time for a table. My server was prompt and very friendly, he commented on my whale tank :)
As an appetizer I ordered the calamari and it came out in a swift manner... It was hot and yummy! My main dish was, of course, the Alfredo the dark! If you haven't tried the Alfredo the dark, you have to. It is my favorite dish. Last but not least your visit will not be complete with out having the Pizookie. It is one of thee best desserts: it comes in a little cute pan and it consists of a warm cookie aka pizza cookie topped with fresh ice cream. It is divine!"}

Everything is good, customer service is gooooooooooooooood and the cookie is goood! 

Pablano alfredo is crazy good and wings are delicious, kale Ceaser is heaven!!!!!!! 

Of corse I live up the street so I come here 3 times a week!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to Cave Creek.  No wonder there are always lines out the yazoo and parking is at a premium---we have needed a place in town that provides tasty food at reasonable prices in a fun, casual atmosphere.  I find their thin crust pizza perfect---just enough crust to get yummy toppings to my mouth and cut in convenient squares.  I love the Pablo Picasso salad.  The sausages and peppers and onions are delish.  Service is pretty good considering the traffic===they screw up, but they fix it with grace and speed.  I am really happy Oregano's has come to town!

And kudos to the company that they spent the time and money to rehab one of the oldest buildings instead of tearing it down.  I think that says a lot."}
{"text":"Chicken Parmesan was everything I expected and more.  Long Island was mixed perfectly.  Ice in a Manhattan was the only complaint regarding drinks.  The food was more than enough.  With the all you can eat pasta you can order what you'll eat then order your seconds for take-out which is great (added price for meatball or sausage).  Minus a star for the 45 minute wait but thats no fault of their own,  good food so most are willing to wait.  Clean environment,  friendly staff.  This is definitely a stop I will be making quite often.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Can't remember our servers name , but he was great ! Super nice , super helpful in deciding what to eat ! The Italian gold wings are very yummy ! :) always love coming here when I wanna splurge ! You gotta get a Pazookie !"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed Oregano's. All the restaurants on this 2 block stretch offers variety and has such a fun atmosphere.  Our waitress was great. Everyone in our group enjoyed their food and had plenty of leftovers. I have a feeling we didn't even experience their best food since we all ordered individual meals and everyone else in the restaurant was eating pizza. I would definitely go back if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but this place is probably not the best place to come if you only have an hour for lunch and don't want to feel rushed. Service was nice too, it was busy and took a bit for the food to come out. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Seems like always a wait. 
Waitress was nice but you can tell she was mad at the kitchen for not getting our food out in time as people who came after us got their food before we got ours as she would smile near us and try to keep us patient but when she thought we weren't looking she looked exasperated. 

Half hour wait for a sandwich and a salad as people who sat after we ordered with cooked meals like chicken parmesan got served before us.

The food is very good though, and the service is nice. There is just some back-end process they need to adjust somewhere."}
{"text":"I visited this location during the very first week it opened.....it is located on the perimeter of the Paradise Valley Mall. When I went in to pick up the pizza I was told by the manager that it was overcooked the crust was too dark and that it would be free and they hoped I would return to visit again. I really appreciated the great customer service and the pizza was pretty tasty..... nice pan crust .....fresh toppings and a good sauce. Now I hear they are still having some issues with the food and service.....so I don't know what all of that is about. However at some point I will dine-in and give them another shot to impress me....because the food is really good....if they can just get it right....LOL. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"The only thing \"Chicago style\" at Oregano's is the time it takes to get your pizza once it's been ordered. I called on a Sunday night and was told it would be 90 minutes before I could come pick it up. I arrived right on time, and my pizza & garlic bread were pulled from an under-the-counter heater and handed over. 

Clearly, I'm starving having had to wait so long until dinner so I'm pretty excited to pull the pizza out of the box and get it on to the plate once I make it back home. Though when I lifted the lid, the excitement fizzled. The pizza did not look fresh, and when I pulled out the first thin crust slice it fell limp and nearly slid itself back into the box. That was worrisome so I carefully transfered a few more squares over, then opened the foil for the garlic bread. More sogginess, and by the looks of the bread it may have been placed under my pizza box inside the pizza-kryptonite heater. Adding insult to injury, the pizza was cool! I actually had to put it in the microwave less than 10 minutes after picking it up. Seriously?!

The first bite of both were equally disappointing. It was hard to handle the pizza squares because they were so limp/soggy, and when I folded it in half the topping separated from the crust as if it had been placed there as a late afterthought. Thin crust pizza should be CRISPY! It doesn't qualify as \"thin crust\" just because the crust is thin! And I've had better garlic bread come with a frozen dinner.

Very disappointed. 1 - If my pizza had been ready earlier than they told me to arrive, they should have called me. They took my number when I placed the order. 2 - The phrase \"Chicago-Style Pizza\" should be regulated like organic and kosher. It's clearly being abused by this establishment. Next time I'll satisfy my craving in the frozen section of the grocer."}
{"text":"1. Wings, Pablo Picasso salad, and pazooki are awesome.
2. Great service and atmosphere.
3. Pizza is good not great."}
{"text":"Even in the 110 degree weather, I do not mind waiting underneath the misters to grab some grub at Oreganos.  Okay, maybe that is a bit of a stretch, but just drink a few beers and your table should be ready.  The thin crust pizza is worth the wait...a reasonable wait, that is.  But the pizookie (huge deep-dish cookie topped with ice cream) is probably worth the unreasonable waits that haunt this pizza joint.  Oreganos is definitely a Valley treat and they cover the Italian basics better than most."}
{"text":"Best place for either lunch or dinner. 
Great service, great food and everything was served fast & best of all not super pricey. 
Enjoyed the ambient! 
Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service, food is extremely AWSOME, pizza is made with fresh ingredients, and the pasta is made with love, casual atmosphere, great beer selection, supporting local breweries, this place is just superduperawsome!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. I felt discriminated against due to being a Latina. This place doesn't welcome diversity! I wouldn't recommend this place. I felt unwelcome, my family and I waited for a table for about 10 minutes and were ignored, my daughter had to speak up and then we decided to leave at that point!"}
{"text":"have visited other Oreganos locations and loved the food and enjoyed the service.  knowing they can be busy, we ordered a pizza for a specific time.  they obviously cooked it way ahead of time as it was totally dries out and disgusting.  also, for the price of a Numero Oneo there were few toppings.  will not be back to this location.  not even close to what  we've experienced at other locations.  this was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Been to this and other locations umpteen times...

Pro's
- salad, Oregano's Original hands down is outstanding
- service truly a staple Oregano's simply is OUTSTANDING
- never a bad meal here or at any location 

Con's
- ahhhh wait times sometimes.  Argh!  

And a special call out to this location.  A month or two ago I ordered takeout and it wasn't ready as promised so they \"comp-ed\" me that order.  

Great job management!"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of this place. We waited for about an hour on a Tuesday night and it was well worth the wait. Everything we had was great, including an antipasti salad, the spinach dip (I forget what it was called but it was great), and the numero uno pizza. They have indoor and outdoor seating and the wait staff was very attentive.  And I got a free chocolate chip cookie in a skillet with ice cream because it was my birthday!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the bruschetta appetizer and pasta entrees, 5 stars for the OH MY EFFING GOD I WOULD EAT THIS WHOLE THING IF NO ONE WERE TO WITNESS IT chocolate chip cookie.

Long wait, but we lucked out and got seats at the bar."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the stuffed mushrooms! Had some pasta meals that where not all that great though."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing restaurant I've been to in Phoenix. You'd think that a wait on a Tuesday evening means it's good. Such is not the case. I ordered a side salad (lettuce and a couple croutons) and it arrived quickly. We were warned that the stuffed Chicago pizza would take 25 minutes. An entire hour later we got the thinnest crust I've ever seen and every pasta dish was bland. The server didn't check back, made no attempt to appease the ridiculous hour long wait for food and jusy walked away when he asked if everything was delicious and several of us said nit really. Twenty minutes later he came back and offered to bring me something else after an hour wait and everyone else was done eating. Food is bland, wait is long, service sucked. Not going back to waste time or money"}
{"text":"This place was MOST Excellent. The server we had was Megan and she was very good at her job, and very attentive. The food was very well priced, and very good. I would highly recommend this place for anyone to try."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Only complaint is we had a party of six and they tried sitting us at a table for four people. However after requested a bigger table the immediately accommodated us. 

Being Italian myself this food was amazing. Thanks Oregano's will be back."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best pasta experience I have ever had. I'm in Arizona for a few days and went in for a quick bite. Boy was I blown away. Everything from the food to the waiters to the atmosphere was just phenomenal. I ordered the original bollo pasta with meat sauce and meatballs and by the first bite I was in pasta heaven. I personally want to take the restaurant back home with me. Our server, Steven, was very sweet and answered our questions. I will make sure to come back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. It's our new favorite restaurant to eat at. I think customer service needs some improvement. I would go back there again."}
{"text":"3rd visit in 3 weeks. We keep coming back for the Pablo Picasso salad and a side of meatballs. Delicious! And Matt is a terrific server."}
{"text":"I wanted to see what the hype was all about. The wait was super long. I loved the all kale Caesar salad. I prefer the thin crust. The deep dish is too doughy for my taste."}
{"text":"Love oreganos!!  We come whenever we are in Phoenix!   Food is great!  Portions are huge!  Get the pazookie!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First timer, delicious. Don't have enough words to describe just how good. From crust to marinara to toppings. My place from now on!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  If you like real good quality pasta at Fair prices, Oregano's is the place to go.  I often have their ziti and we get their pizza.  The flavors are great.  Be prepared for a long wait at the Goodyear location though.  It will be worth it."}
{"text":"Took my friends here yesterday for lunch.  I am a huge Oreganos fan but never been tobthis location. 

Food-  it was great.  Had the Ziti with meatballs.  So good!  Co-workers had doable pasta and egg plant pasta.  Both ate every last piece.  Huge portions as usual.  Food 5 stars.

Service-  amazing as always.  Waitress was awesome and always checked in.  Even joked with us a little.  Only wish the food came a little faster.  Tough to eat here for lunch since the food is fresh, takes a little longer to make.

Overall-  not crazy busy for lunch, got straight in.  Everything was great and what I expected from Oreganos.  Prices are a tad steep, paid $20 for drink and pasta but that included tip.  

We will continue to return."}
{"text":"Great food, usually really good service, such great prices! I've tried a ton of different dishes, and most of them are amazing; super thin crust pizza (which I don't prefer).. it's good but not amazing pizza...but depends on type of crust you like I think."}
{"text":"Had to wait 40 minutes to eat and it was worth the wait. Friday night's@ 7pm are busy at most good places. The two hostesses were extremely  friendly. The manager was incredible. He was checking  on all the guest he 'touched' our table  twice. The wait staff was supportive, helpful  and friendly. Wes was our waiter and he was funny and provided great service. I think All Oregano' s are really good restaurants and this location was the cream of the crop. The best Oregano' s ive been to by far."}
{"text":"People stand in the hot AZ in line outside of these Oregano's and I just don't get it. But then again they do the same at Olive Garden. They have OK food and respectable service, even though one of the servers whisked away 2 out of 3 salad bowls while there was clearly over half of one of their large salads quite visible. Then even though we said WHOA the over zealous server (who had his thumb in the eating area of the bowl) tried to put them back down. We insisted he bring new bowls and he couldn't understand why.

My sandwich was decent, the pizza I felt very over priced. It's one of those places I'll go back to if friends insist but I will do my best to steer the party to a better restaurant."}
{"text":"I actually haven't been to oreganos very many times in my life, but I've never been disappointed! This location is nice, not too incredibly busy when we went!
The service was great, everything came out quick. We all got different things and shared so I got to try the guacatony, Brussel sprouts, and a pizza I can't remember the name of but it had mushrooms, spinach, and garlic. The guacatony was good but I wasn't like as crazy about it like I know some other people are. But it was tasty! The Brussel sprouts were not bad, some were a teeny bit too burned, but other ones were perfect. The pizza was my favorite! I got the 14in and nearly finished it to my surprise so I'm glad I wasn't splitting it haha. Tasted fresh, the veggies on there were yummy! Sometimes places put too much spinach on their pizza but this had the perfect amount. Was a little pricey, but not terrible. Overall I left happy!"}
{"text":"Five stars for their amazingly delicious Pablo Picasso salad. It is my favorite go to menu item here.  I haven't dined in about 7 years, due to long waits so I can't rate the servers as I am a take out customer only."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the real deal are the Pizza cookies.  The original is best."}
{"text":"When will I ever learn?? The service here is absolutely terrible. They don't take reservations, which is the dumbest thing I've ever heard, so I came in with a party of 9 for a birthday dinner and boy was that a mistake!!!! You would think they would be understanding and accommodating for a birthday dinner, but nope! The manager said 25-30 minutes. 30 minutes later we ask for an update and he said oh well it will be at least another 45 minutes. He was so rude and had absolutely no regard for the fact that it was my sister's birthday and put her immediately in a shitty mood. So frustrating!!"}
{"text":"I'm not generally a fan of chain restaurants, but as chain restaurants go, its a good one.  It is a bit cheesy (both in food and in sense of humor) but the food portions are huge and taste pretty good.  The price points are good and the service is friendly.  This place is always packed.  So be prepared for a wait.  They have pizza to please both fans of the thin crust or the thick.  Although if you get the thick crust pizza be prepared for a wait.  I always get the wedding soup which is delicious with meatballs and small bits of pasta in a chicken broth.  It is not too salty which makes me super happy!  If you're brave get a pizza cookie they can get it to have two different kinds of pizza dough and topped with vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"Great place I love it ..I love the pastas and pizzas..don't forget the cookie great service u need to try it"}
{"text":"Four of us arrived early for dinner and only had to wait about 20 minutes. This was a Thursday night and by 5:00 pm the parking lot was full. So, this place is very popular. Once seated our waitperson took our beverage requests. Two beers, glass of red wine and Moscow Mule. Another 20 minutes go by. Then another staff person brought our order but the Moscow Mule was a Manhatten. Both start with M right? Another 20 minutes go by before our server brought us the right drink. We ordered an appetizer and entrees. Appetizer came quickly and was good. Entrees arrived in reasonable time but we foolishly ordered more drinks. Another 20 minutes. Food was good and plentiful. But the problems with bar lost a star for me. They better get their act together if they want to go national as rumored."}
{"text":"Favorite Italian food joint. Wait at times sucks but the food and drinks are worth it. Always a smile the moment you check in and the food is always warm. Always a large a portion and you can count on taking some home. 

Angel bowl of never ending pasta is the prime order. The marinara is delicious and the pesto bowls are a killer. I approve."}
{"text":"Shortly after posting my last review I was contacted by a very sweet member of Oregano's customer service department. We were invited back to try the Gilbert location with a certificate for part of a meal. As someone who believes that customer service can make or break a company, we decided to try again.

Our last trip a few days ago was much better. We still had a wait for three of us on a Tuesday, but this time our server was right on point and took great care of us. He definitely turned things around and we will be likely to return sometime in the future. Even after having to listen to the hostess loudly talking(and swearing) to her personal friends at the booth next to us for the whole meal. Again, no manager in sight the entire time we were there. We just wanted to thank them for the certificate and compliment our server. This place isn't that big, where are they all hiding? 

All in all I can appreciate that they took the time to make things right. The wait and foul mouthed hostess kept us from having warm fuzzies about this place but we'll be back to satisfy our pazookie craving soon."}
{"text":"Great, from scratch Italian food. Hot, Fresh and delicious! I wish I could eat this weekly but I live in MT.  Very inexpensive and well worth the Uber to this delicious restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why it took me more than 2 years living here to stop in to Oregano's. Needless to say, I will be back. Awesome, friendly service, great food, and reasonable prices. I'll have to check out the other locations to see if they are just as good!"}
{"text":"These meals are so huge.  I come here for lunch but the menu items I want are too big to eat for a lunchtime meal.  I usually just settle on a salad which are very delicious and tasty but they are completely devoid of any of the healthy reasons that you'd get a salad to begin with.  So I leave feeling guilty for the calories and bummed I didn't just get the Zany Ziti, Big Ol Ravioli or the Penne Pasta Bake.  

Great service, always very quick during the lunch hour, clean establishment, the ambiance isn't as nice as the one in Gilbert but it's still a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered cheesy bread as an appetizer Bread comes with marinara sauce. Had the Julius Caesar salads. julius would have marched all the way to arizona for this rendition of his immortal salad: romaine lettuce, our special dressing, homemade croutons & shredded parmesan cheese. 
Ordered Puerto Penasco Carne Street Pie and also a Numerous One o thin crust pie--- who's number one? this pizza is! try our traditional combination of homemade sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions and green peppers. it makes for one incredible pizza and it's super filling. if you didn't know this is the greatest stuffed pizza on the planet, you will..All were fantastic! Ordered the Pizza cookie ( salted caramel)
The Original Pizza Cookie
now this will knock your socks off! more than a 1/2 pound of chocolate chip, white chocolate macadamia nut or peanut butter chocolate cookie dough, slightly baked in a 6-inch pizza pan then topped with three scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. this baby serves 2-4. You can get the pizza cookie for free if you become an instant member of the Kaboom club and sign up on the website! We will come back to try different items as everything was VERY good!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Husband and I went on a Wednesday night hoping it wouldn't be too crowded. It was about a 15 minute wait (not bad) but we were starving so decided to eat the bar. The bartenders were fun and informative, which really helped since I'm gluten free. When I asked for the GF menu, they made sure to point out their kitchen is NOT GF and has pizza flour floating around. I appreciate the heads up but ate it anyway and it was delicious! Tons of cheese and they offered fresh grated parm when they brought it out. Hubby got a pizza w/carne asada, which I never heard of. He liked it, then added Cholula sauce like the menu recommends and he said it was great. The service from hostess, to bartender, to the waitress that showed me where the bathroom was hidden were all super friendly. My only suggestion for improvement would be more GF options besides pizza and salad (tho they did have some veggie appetizers too) but I'm talking main dish. And a GF pizooki would be great too!"}
{"text":"Love. This. Place. Every time I go to AZ I beg my sis to take us there (But she makes me try new places instead of going back to the same ones!). I love the wings, especially the honey mustard wings. I have yet to find another place on earth that serves these. And they are a good texture - crispy yet soaked in sauce. The pizza is fabulous too, but my next favorite is the pizzookie. Atmosphere = great. I dream of Oregano's."}
{"text":"Our server, Brianna, is the absolute sweetest. I'd give this place five stars for her alone. The food was great and the drinks were awesome. Everything was at a perfect price for what we ended up with. Nothing can keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"After coming here for years and loving it, yesterday's experience was so disappointing.  They have changed the menu so no longer is the Junior sausage sandwich available, just the regular.  Ok, we like leftovers but guess what? The \"regular\" size is the same as the Junior was but the price went up!  
Then I ordered the Bollo Pasta, which usually comes with 2 large slices of garlic toast.  Instead it came with 2 tiny bites.  No Parmesan was offered, the sausage sandwich had zero sauce so we had to order that extra, and my husband's last straw - they changed from Coke products to Pepsi!  Our waitress said there were numerous complaints about this but Pepsi is cheaper for management to serve.  Overall it appears management is scrimping on all the things that have made this place a favorite.  It will be replaced as our go-to weekend restaurant.  So sad."}
{"text":"If you are looking for to go pizza, this is not the place.  We have tried to order \"to go\" on numerous occasions but every time  we are told there is almost a 2 hour wait.  

Finally, after being frustrated that they always seem busy, I asked if we came and order at the bar would it be faster and they said yes. 

So it seems it takes pizza to go longer to bake than if you sit in and eat."}
{"text":"I've eaten at different Oregano's twice now.  The regular pizza is quite good.  I was thrilled that someone finally offered a stuffed pizza!  Now I'm used to Giordanos' stuffed pizza out of Chicago, but for the big game splurged and spent $25 on a small, four topping, stuffed pizza from Oregano's.  I was very disappointed.  Everything was very good with one big exception, the crust.  It was over done, but wasn't like normal pizza crust to begin with.  Bisquick?  No bready, springy, texture and very quickly was a soggy mess.  Stuck to paper lining in the box.  Taste was bad, too.  Very, very disappointed.  Also this location is not too good for pick-up as parking is way in the back.  Please someone - Make a good Stuffed Pizza!?!"}
{"text":"Cute spot with unique pizzas off of the main downtown university street close to the zoo and airport. 4.3 stars

Food: 4.4, Atmosphere: 4.3, Service: 4
Cost to worth it rating: 3
Return worthiness: yes
Eve award: best variation of fried raviolis

Highlights:
- Toasted raviolis: filled with delicious jalapeño cheese. And I thought I couldn't possibly love fried raviolis more than I already did ;-)
- Crust options: from crispy paper thin to Chicago pan to stuffed
- Potato rosemary pizza: great combo of garlic, potato slices, caramelized onions, bit of gorgonzola, and havarti cheeses
- Tub o Parmesan: wait staff comes around with it to scoop on top
- Patio: liked that option in the middle of the 2 inside dining rooms and sweet that they have blankets out there in case it gets chilly
- Staff: very friendly and helpful. We had a big party and they tried their best to accommodate us as quickly as possible
- Menu: with wings and pasta and sandwiches, a lot more to offer than just pizza 
- Fun retro decor and music: classic style ads were on the front of the menu
- Dirty monkey: classic rum fruit cocktail that was quite delicious

Midlights:
- Sangria: just ok, not so much fruity flavor
- Pizza cookie: half done to give it that gooey almost cookie dough-like texture, but I prefer it a bit more crispy

Lowlights:
- Only certain pizzas can be thin or Chicago style and the menu isn't so clear on that so it's a bit confusing

Enjoyed this yelp find and would eat here again or another location since I found out it's a chain."}
{"text":"The 1st time I went to Oreganos on Dobson and Southern, food was amazing so next time I decided to try the one on Gilbert Road. I did not care for the brushetta as the tomato pieces were too big so that they did not stay on the bread and the veggie sandwich had no taste to it and too big to bite on. The hot wings were too hot. The food was not as good at the Dobson branch. The service was good- friendly but the food put me off of going to it again. S.T."}
{"text":"Wrong Oreganos. The one on Scottsdale Rd near Thomas has much better Pizza. The one on Shea has a hard cardboard crust and modest amount of mozzarella that gets burnt from overcooking. Salads and sandwiches are good. Pasta are mushy and don't reheat well."}
{"text":"I did a fundraiser here back in April, on a Wednesday night,  and I honestly will never go back. I am so glad that I actually did not have come here because I would have been so embarrassed. My family arrived there at about 6; I arrived after a meeting i had to attend at about 7:15ish and they still had not been seated. Finally about 7:45, we get seated. My party was about 15-18 people and they did not have room for all of us to sit together so we were divided up between three tables. The waitress was nice but took a little bit of time to get our drinks and get back with them. 

Finally getting our order in about 8 o clock, I was still peeved about having to wait so long. Our food took just as long as it did to seat us and all we had ordered was a pizza and a salad. It does not take that long to make either of them. The two other tables got their food long before we did and they both had their order taken a good 10 minutes after ours.

This was my first experience going to this location and it was honestly the worst. As I stated in the first paragraph, I am glad that I did not hand out of those fundraiser flyers because I would have been completely embarrassed if I promoted such horrible service to people I didn't even know. I understand that places are busy but it was a Wednesday night, I am scared to see what it is like on a Friday or a Saturday."}
{"text":"Took at party of 11 tonight to celebrate 3 birthdays. Arrived 5:15pm was told we had 45-60 min wait. It was crazy busy! We waited the full 60 min, but was told they were having trouble getting a big enough spot to seat us all together & it would Be 10-15 more minutes. We were compensated for our time, so we gladly waited. 
The manger took great care of us & our waitress was superb! 
We placed orders for the Chicago style pan Numero-one pizza while we waited. They were ready by the time we got seated. Big dinner & caesar Salads, thin crust  Sproccoli pizza were fresh, delicious, & very flavorful! Top off the evening with our favorite part of the meal... Pizza cookies, One of each please! I must say, white chocolate macadamia nut & peanut butter are my favorite! They will even do half/half for you too! Each birthday gal/guy got a free pazookie!! Yeah!
We have been here several times. every time we come, we are very well taken care of by the wait staff, not to mention management pops by to check on us to make sure we are happy & satisfied. 
Already looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Slow service,  especially trying to order food at bar.  No gluten free pasta or pizza options."}
{"text":"We order take out from here every so often and the process is seamless.  The staff is very helpful and efficient.  Our order is very consistent and they have never made an error or left anything out.  I think the food is average but I do enjoy the Lawrence's Original Pizza.  The ingredients seem fresh and the pizza is prepared well."}
{"text":"Nothing beats an Italian dinner. I've been to this location many times for the past 4 years. Their food quality has always been top notch. The serves are nice and knowledgeable about the menu. I love how they're a family business, not just some giant corporate who likes to franchise their locations everywhere. 

For today I ordered the meatball pasta with ice tea and man it couldn't get any better. The meat is well cooked although depending on your preference you can also get it medium done, medium rare, and so on. The noodles are juicy and well marinated, every bite is exceptionally delicious. 

Overall, very satisfied with oreganos and their service."}
{"text":"This place has it all!  Excellent food!  Fantastic Service!  And GREAT ATMOSPHERE!  We just noshed on appetizers at lunch today and it was great.

I'd love to come back and have a real meal, maybe try out some offerings from the bar.  I think sitting out on the patio on a cool night would be great!

Watch out at lunch!  I hear from the regulars that it gets packed out fast!"}
{"text":"Oregano's sticks the landing every single time!  Great food.  I love the fusion of Mexican and Italian foods centered around the common ingredients of oregano and garlic!  They always have such young and energetic staff here that takes really good care of their patrons and the theme / ambiance is pure Italian 50's cheesy but very tastefully done.  Food is great and prices are more than fair."}
{"text":"Seems to be the family fav gathering spot, likely due to the waiting gathering area outside. It really is the perfect place to meet several people all coming separately.  Nieces and nephews can chow down serious style.  Fav items- Honey gold wings appetizer, guac appetizer Mmm, garlic bread side, and like always, way too full before my main dish arrives. Wedding soup, salads. My fav thing... huge diet soda. I mostly like holding the monster cup."}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars for the following reasons

Wait time, they can have empty tables at any given time and will have a wait. If you know your always busy, staff more people...

Service, service is always subpar at best. Maybe because they are so busy? See solution to number one...

Price, if you get the regular pizza and some sodas it's pretty reasonable priced. The kids meals are what is crazy. 4.99 for pasta, $1 extra for Alfredo sauce, $1 for minimal amount of chicken. That's more expensive and my kid liked it less than Olive Garden. (She doesn't like Olive Garden either if that says anything) 

In all it's a place to grab a pie once but don't go with kids that don't eat thin crust pizza and be ready to wait. Heck I recommend eating about an hour before you go, you'll be hungry by the time your food gets to you."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance! If I were to decorate a restaurant it would look like this! Every bit of food was delicious! We ordered enough to bring home leftovers, but in the end we ate EVERYTHING!!! 
Ordered shrimp Diablo scampi, Carne Asada and cheese pizza, stuffed rigatoni, baked pesto penne, and meatball sandwich with waffle fries"}
{"text":"Very positive experience here.  Went for lunch this past Sunday.  

Place was busy, but handled it well. We asked for first available and were able to get seated immediately at the bar.  Bartender acted as our waiter.  He was quick and efficient, clearly a seasoned hand at juggling the bar drink needs and those of us who were also dining.

Ordered the thin crust Aunt Margherita pizza.  We got the smallest pizza size and it was perfect for the two of us.  Ingredients were fresh, crust was cooked perfectly.   

Facilities were fine, place was clean, plenty of seating option, staff knew what they were doing.  Price was reasonable, about $22 for the two of us.  No complaints at all.  Several locals have told me this is their favorite pizza place and their only complaint is that sometimes it gets super busy - so there can be a wait.  

Bottom line - Rock solid good pizza.  I'd definitely go there again.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"We have been here every time we travel to Scottsdale, the service and food is wonderful, I only wish I could eat here more often. 
Great job Oreganos

Love the thin crust pizzas,salads to share and the cookie with ice cream 
Yum"}
{"text":"Busy as always. Worth the wait as always. Ladies at the To Go counter swamped but rocking it with a smile!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this Oregano's location! I've been eating Oregano's for 15 years; mostly at the Scottsdale & Shea location, but also in Tucson and Flagstaff. I've been to this new Oregano's five times because it's a bit closer than the Scottsdale & Shea location. I've had problems every time. Burnt pizza, under-cooked pizza, long waits picking up pizza, miss matched toppings, impossible to cut, cardboard-like crust etc. I ordered two pan pizzas and one thin crust tonight (3/1/13). I came in at 6 pm to pick up the pizza. They came out and told me the pizza was completely burnt.  Before asking whether or not I still wanted it or even showing me the pizza, they apologized and were already cooking new pizzas for us which were ready by 6:30. After complaining that the thin pizza was no longer hot, the staff gave it to us for free. When we began eating the pan pizza we discovered that the two thick pizzas were completely under-cooked. Of course, the thin pizza was cold due to sitting for 30 min while waiting for the thick pizzas. 

Because the pan pizza was hot at the time, a few of our guests tried eating the pizza to be polite. Due to the under-cooked crust, it was doughy and disgusting.  One guest in particular is now having stomach issues after eating a slice of it. We will NEVER visit this location again. We will gladly drive the extra 20 minutes to the Shea location since we do still love Oregano's. However, we will avoid the PV location like the plague!"}
{"text":"I have had better.  Our waiter was great but the food was below average.  

I ordered a lemon drop and it tasted like pure lemon juice, had one sip and set it aside.  Pizza was bad - sorry can't think of one good thing to say about. it.  Has anyone been to Chicago that works in the kitchen? 

My husband ordered the chicken parmesan and I tried it an die both thought we have had better on airplanes. Sorry, I don't think I will be back unless they get new ownership and new recipes."}
{"text":"When you want filling, good food and you're not watching your waistline...this is a good place to go!  Gets pretty crowded though, so expect a wait. I like the chicken parm sandwich."}
{"text":"From the other reviews I've read for this location, they seem to be having problems getting their act together, but both visits I've had here have been great experiences.

The service and perkiness almost borders on annoying. Almost. They have just he right amount of friendliness and sincerity to not cross over into the cloying territory. Drinks were never empty, the check cycle was quick. What more can you ask for from your waitstaff?

The Alfredo the Dark pasta (with chicken) never disappoints. It is big enough to take half of it home and have a great meal the next day as well. The salads are huge. Even what they have as a \"side\" salad is meal sized dish of fresh Romaine, Parmesan, and tangy Caesar dressing."}
{"text":"Fantastic in every way, never have any complaints. Best pizza I have personally ever had and can't help myself from scarfing it down every time that delicious stuff arrives at my table."}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday and the place was packed.  We were seated right away.  The service is 5 star top notch.  Now, I am a Chicagoan and love pizza and I was excited to try this place.  We ordered an appetizer, the calamari, and it was good.  It was served with marana no cocktail sauce, but I like mine with a ranch dip and that was pretty tasty.  The pizza, my husband and I ordered an 18 inch thin...and it was paper thin.  It was more like a flat bread than a pizza.  We had half cheese and half mushroom and green peppers.  They use fresh veggies and the sausage was excellent however it was sparingly on the pizza.  Very frugal with the ingredients considering the pricing.  I will try it again, but maybe the deep dish."}
{"text":"Not necessarily diet food, but who goes to an Italian place to watch their diet? Not me. A nice little addition to Cave Creek and the people have spoken: they love it. The place is almost always packed. Don't go too late into dinner time and expect to get a seat immediately. These seats are hot commodities in tiny Cave Creek, and news travels fast. Sneak in a little early and you'll probably be fine, or they have tables in the bar section which turn over more quickly and you might be able to nab one. Last time I had to take a seat and eat at the bar itself, but that was ok. Food was just as good.
 
The salads are truly massive. The food is spiced right and enticing. One thing that does kinda irk me, though: if you sit in the bar section they have tv's, but they play old Lone Ranger episodes. Huh? Maybe I'm no fun and they're just being kitschy or something, but that was a mystery to me. Can't we get a Suns game or something, anything, other than that? Whatever, this is a good place to satisfy your Italian food jones."}
{"text":"If you are in any sort of a time crunch stay away from this place.

They wont let you put your name on the list if the whole party isn't present. Then we waited over an hour for our pizza to to get to the table. 

Totally ridiculous."}
{"text":"Got seated very quickly. Very relaxed atmosphere with lights not too bright. Wait staff is very friendly, and food came out at perfect times. Drinks are were refilled quickly! You must have the pizza cookie for desert it is a perfect desert to share with your special someone our a group of friends !!"}
{"text":"This is a family staple for us.  Always the best and most friendly service from the hostesses to the waiters.  And they're actually sincere about it.  This place deserves 5 stars all around.  The only issue is that wait times can be brutal but that should be a testament to how well liked this place is.  Disregard the star rating and try it out.  A 2 hour wait on Friday night is there for a reason."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to Oreganos and everything was amazing! The wait staff was friendly, the food was great, the music and decor made me feel like I had travelled back in time (in a good way), and they made our visit special. I wish there was a comparable restaurant out here in WA. Oreganos has even Olive Garden beat! Mom and I were in AZ for my graduation from Grand Canyon University and Oreganos made it that much more memorable. We even got a free pizookie, something that they are famous for, and LOVED it. THANK YOU for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix! Love the thin crust pizza. Very close to being east coast. Three thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, but the young staff really needs to step up their customer service skills. There were 4 people behind the check out counter, I was the only one in line and it took over five minutes of me standing there for someone to ring me up for my order. I would've understood of they were busy, but they were talking amongst themselves, greeting friends that were coming in for dinner and walking them to their tables. A waitress who had nothing to do with my check out was the only person that greeted me, asked how my day was and if I had been helped. There is room for improvement guys."}
{"text":"Our bartender, Collin, was awesome! On a busy Saturday night he was quick to get our drinks and appetizers out. He kept up the service with refills and making sure we didn't need anything else. 

The food was phenomenal. We had the cheese pizza and the pasta with meat sauce. And the cookie. The cookie is to die for. 

I'd go here anytime I'm back in Arizona."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there.  Toasted ravioli was excellent and so was the pizza.  We had a thin crust.   We ate outdoors. Highly recommend.  We did have a 45 minute wait.  Perhaps it was because it was St. Patricks Day.   It was worth the wait."}
{"text":"great place to get good hearty food. definitely a go to when i want a lot of food."}
{"text":"Gotta say it's one of the better chain restaurants around in the valley!

American-Italian pizzas and pastas sounds pretty simple, but Oregano's is one of those places that's a must try.  With several locations from Scottsdale, Tempe, Chandler, and even Tucson; you really don't have much reason not to go!  

This time around I ordered the Clark St. Meat pizza along with trying out my friends anti-pasto salad.  Again, simple, but tasty.  The salami, peppercini pepper, and parmesan cheese on the salad was very light and not over powering with dressing like most places.  The pizza I ordered thin crust and yes the crust was perfectly toasted and not soggy as I would expect with all the meat ingredients atop.  Tad bit of spice and no need to add more peppers to heat it up - yum!  

Overall, food was great and service is very good.  Well trained staff members, courtesy and attentive - A plus in my book! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food and half the price of places in Old Town, less than a mile away. The chicken parmigiana had nicely done chicken and al dente fettuccine. The deep dish pizza had a buttery deliciousness with a nice balance of cheese, crust, and the rest. They also put together a custom pesto pasta dish for us which got fantastic reviews from the recipient (who's picky about her pesto).
The only downside was a bit of a wait but we'd gladly wait again for that food. The fun atmosphere and good quality music helps too."}
{"text":"David was AWESOME!! our server went above asnd beyond for our family celebrating my grandma's 95th birthday!! On top of the great service and excellent food (Chicago style stuffed,  can't go wrong-worth the wait!)...David has an impressive handlebar mustache.  Luv it, such fun! Oreganos thank you for making our celebration special, you rawk!"}
{"text":"First of all, the quality of the ingredients is top notch. The food is delicious. The portion sizes are large and in charge. The BOOM dip is outstanding. The pizza was good and the salads are incredible. It is a very popular place with the locals. (And I can see why) 

The only thing that I wished was better was their drink menu. 

If you are in town go. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food is ALWAYS spectacular and hot. The service is constantly friendly, polite, and people-oriented. I am impressed with the all-around aspects of this Italian restaurant. Beware of the 3 hour waits on Friday and Saturday nights, however. Great place for parties, large groups, or even just a few friends."}
{"text":"My first time here...very cute retro inside...retro music...we were seating quick server explained the menu...my Dad got all you can eat pasta bowl...looked good then spaghetti...I got the big rig rigatoni....we got a salad yo split 4.79...huge...I'm talking big....took half home as mix of greens...got Italian dressing I guess they put a little marinara in it....yum...good prices..cute place....good food"}
{"text":"Booked a hotel near the ASU campus and we were looking for a pizza joint, and thank goodness we found this! Place is pretty small but once we found parking, it was all greatness from there. Hostesses were amazingly hot! Then we got seated and started off with the shrimp Caesar salad that was big enough to feed 4 people! We followed that with a great tasting Numero one-o thin crust! Everything was delicious and loved the mix of college student and baseball fan crowd! We'll be back next year fo sho"}
{"text":"Expect a wait on most nights, but its worth it! This place is awesome! They serve Italian food with their own spin on it. The pizza is amazing! The salads are great and the pasta is to die for. Get a dirty monkey or 3 to sip on while you eat or while you're waiting for your table. If you've never been at least go once to see for yourself."}
{"text":"Jenny introduced me to Oregano's not long after we started dating. I'm not a big fan of chains or franchises -- even smaller ones -- but I'm also committed to giving any place a chance. Since that rainy day introduction some (three?) years ago, I've never really had a 'bad' Oregano's experience. But, that being said, part of the Oregano's experience is the long dining time which, on a weekend, generates longer waits for a table. So that's Oregano's. 

The Camelback location has been our 'home' Oregano's since we moved to Phoenix. The parking here is a little tight and you'll often find yourself pulling up to the curb on one of the streets behind the restaurant. But the staff is great and there is adequate seating for your pre-meal wait. That all said, my go-to here is the meatball sub or the Big Bambino salad. The BigBam is sooooooo good and I like that the portions are sized to share."}
{"text":"This is the closest you will get to Chicago Style Pizza in AZ.  I would even argue that the crust is better than some Chicago place (if you like a buttery crust).  The wait is long typically, but trust me when I tell you that it's worth it!  The pasta here is also delicious.  I also recommend the fries with aoli sauce and the salad.  This place is YUM!"}
{"text":"Oregano's tried to kill me by putting me in a food coma.

Yes, the value is off the charts. The amount of food you get for the price is ridiculous. You can easily make one meal stretch into three or four. And it all tastes good.

The service really irked me though. 

I had  never eaten at an Oregano's before, so I didn't really know the deal, but apparently everything on the menu (except salads) takes approximately 35-55 minutes to cook. Uh, seriously? 

Our lunch (six women and 1 baby) took over TWO HOURS!? That's just insane. 

When someone would order something our server would say \"You DO know that takes about 45 minutes, right?\" uh... No actually I didn't. Thanks for making me look like an idiot though.

We had appetizers, then salad, then pizza and entrees. We mostly shared everything because of the portions and time to cook, but the server never offered to clear our steady growth of dirty plates, and when we asked him to clear them, he didn't bring new plates or silverware. 

And when he did finally clear some things, he held the plates over the baby's head... I mean Jesus Christ, have some awareness! 

Yeah the food was good, but is it worth the time or the crazy amount of calories? No."}
{"text":"We used Yelp to find pizza near our hotel. This place was delicious with a fun atmosphere. I overcame my abstinence from heavy carbs for my visit. The artichoke dip was good; more bitter than sweet with great olive oil flavoring. The bread sticks that came with it were amazing! We had the house style pizza- excellent. The big beefstro was very wholesome, huge and had lots of fresh ingredients. The jalepeno dressing was delicious."}
{"text":"Just ordered a cheese pizza, extra cheese. It took over an hour for them to get it to me, and when it arrived it had NO cheese on it! Seriously, you just delivered me an expensive dried out cracker with dried out sauce on it. There are 20 pizza joints in this neighborhood, congrats on being the one that can't manage to freaking make a cheese pizza."}
{"text":"We got to the restaurant at 11:03am. They open at 11:00am. We were told it would be a 10-15 min. wait. 10 min. later they were telling people it was going to be a 40-50 min. wait all the wile there were open seats everywhere. 
20 min. later said in Sponge Bob talk, we were seated. We had 5 staff tell us they were sorry for our wait before we made it to our table. 
We ordered the Big Meatball, the ZanyZiti and the child slices of cheese pizza and fries. 
All the food was great. The ziti was on the spicy side, but over all everything was made with love. Good portions, the food was hot when it came to our table and our server Gabriel was a beast. She gave her tables so much attention she could have basically sat and ate with us; we lacked nothing during our meal."}
{"text":"I heard a joke once before ... they're not mad, they're just hot! And I use this to describe the customer service we received at lunch the other week. Our waitress didn't smile once while we were there. Just zero pizzazz. And it wasn't even 11:30 am yet for her to have a bad day, at least I don't think so. But at least she was nice? When our drink orders came, my co-worker ordered a sierra mist, only to find some black crud in his cup. Our waitress did apologize and came back with a new one for him.

Other than that, the food is good there. Good enough that my co-workers come to this restaurant all the time.

I ordered the O'zone Special of the day which was the Especial. But if we wanted to know what's in it, per the waitress, look it up under the hot sandwiches...hahaha.  I ain't making this up. That's exactly what she told us. Although it was the o'zone special of the day, it seemed it was their regular sized calzone. I could only eat half of the calzone! And it tasted pretty good. And honestly, I have had better calzone and far better customer service. 

As always, I'm happy to change my rating with an improved experience."}
{"text":"Oregano's is a good spot and has a really cool vibe.  The food is pretty good and the portions are large.  They have a good selection of drinks and the servers are all good.  This location does get really crowded during peak times so keep that in mind.  There is an outdoor seating area that is nice and the place has a nice but casual feel to it that works!"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio. Food and service were fine. A little too expensive. A pizza, kids meal, 4 sodas, salad, and two beers. Bill was $50. Add in the tip, and it's pretty expensive for a pizza dinner."}
{"text":"Brand New location on the perimeter of the Paradise Valley Mall, I saw the notice on Facebook today and had to order a pizza today. This is my first time having Oregano's and it was pretty tasty nice pan crust fresh toppings and a good sauce. When my husband went in to pick up the pizza he was told by the manager that it was overcooked the crust was too dark and that it would be free and they hoped we would return to visit again. Talk about great customer service of course we will be back. I greatly enjoyed my pizza and can't wait to have another one very soon. I also need to eat in to have the full experience and then maybe I can't change my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great Cesar Salad for the price! Love the pizza delicious! Kids love the buttered pasta!"}
{"text":"I am amazed by this little place. We had the deep dish cheese chicago pizza and a Rosemary potato pizzia. As u can see we ate it all and loved it. I am sitting here @ oregnos writing this, loving the atmosphere and spot on service. Can't wait to try the pizza cookie!"}
{"text":"Waiting area is outside and in this heat, a long wait is miserable. No misters, fans, or breeze. Finally got inside and of the many Oregano's I have visited in the valley, this one is the noisiest and most disorganized one I have been to."}
{"text":"Oregeno's food and atmosphere never let me down!  I love their variety of delicious salads.  I always add Avacado to make the salad even better.  Oh my goodness, their belini's are the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and awesome dessert cookie. We visit Arizona about once a year and this is one of those restaurants that we actually think of as soon as we get off the airplane. A must visit when you are in the Phoenix area. They also have great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Another great the chain place that I discovered in Phoenix based on a recommendation. Well I was not disappointed! The portions are absolutely huge and the food quality is way above good.  What sets this place apart is the great and friendly service that everyone gives in the restaurant. I was always attended to and even offered it to go glass for my drink. This is a must stop for folks who want some decent not too expensive Italianfood with some awesome service!"}
{"text":"We had a late lunch and picked a booth in the back surrounded by infants.
    Joe was our very glib server who knew his menu.
We ordered the stuffed pizza to go with pepperoni and sausage and the lasagna, and
Vino Bambino salad.
     The VB Caeser salad was huge and tasted good. It had cheese, beans, pasta, onions, and bell peppers. The lasagna was very unusual. There was no Ricotta cheese and no pasta just sausage. No thanks to the lasagna.
   The appetizer choice was \"Guaq a Tony\" was guacamole with thin cheese-covered pizza crust. We thought this was tasty.
    This place was not crowded but the kitchen was slow.
We had an opportunity to meet Mike the GM. Mike is a StandUp guy.
Don't forget to ask Joe about the Free Appetizer Deal!"}
{"text":"it's oregano's. what's not to love??? 

new things to try - the guaca-tony; guac served with a nekkid pizza crust. i'll forgive them for the ridiculous amounts of raw red onions sprinkled all over. 

and my fave - the veggie wedge - or big ole vedge as it's now called comes in a JUNIOR!??? love it."}
{"text":"5 STARS FOR THE HALFBAKED COOKIE AND ICECREAM DESSERT!

I know it's all about the pizza here, but honestly I can barely remember it after finishing with that halfbaked wonderfulness.

If you get it, SHARE it and definitely go half and half.  Half chocolate chip and half white chocolate macadamia nut cookies.

That being said.

We ordered the stuffed deep dish Numero-One-O pizza, and honestly although it was good, it was just TOO MUCH CHEESE.
Once you slice into it, it BLEEDS CHEESE.
Sorry to be gross, but the cheese was literally pouring over the side of the pizza tray.

I couldn't even get more than one slice down and I am a pizza eater.  Seriously.  I've won contests.

I will go for the thin crust pizzas next time and leave the massive stuffed pies for those who like their cheese through a straw.

Overall, great experience.  Our server was friendly and put up with my silliness and jokes and even threw in a few herself.
We had drinks and wings to start with, so we didn't mind waiting the 45 minutes for the stuffed madness, and the whole evening was just as merry as could be.

But, I seriously think the cheese factor needs to be disclosed before allowing someone to order the stuffed pie.

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this location. We had a 20 minute wait and were then seated with Bryson as our waiter. He's the best waiter we've had in a long time. The antipasto salad was enormous and delicious. It could feed 6-8 people, easily. The pizza cookie was great, too. Our two pizzas were both a bit over cooked, but the service alone made our visit worth 5 stars. Thank you, Bryson!"}
{"text":"My favorite pasta is Zany Ziti. The desert pizookie is also really good. They've never let me down. One of the best local places."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken Parmesan pasta and it was dried and stiff. Really bad honestly. Easter Day 2017 9:30pm."}
{"text":"Oreganos offers very generous portions at actually a more than reasonable prices. The food is average to slightly above average though in fairness not exceptional - but I'm Italian and my standards are pretty high. 

The apps were plentiful but may have come from frozen (the calamari and zucchini anyway) so they were good but we'd likely skip next time. 

The stuffed mushrooms were a surprise! 2 huge portobellos. And pretty good too. The meatball sandwich was very good and super filling. The side of chips were also very enjoyable. And the salads are huge!

Service was great. Kelsey was incredibly helpful, bubbly, and kind. A real gem. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Some friends of ours recommended Orenganos. Glad they did!  This is probably now our favorite thin crust pizza place.  We had the Mexican with red jalapeños.  They had just the right amount of bite to them.  We ordered it with light cheese and it came just as ordered.  We ordered the waffle fries too.  They were good, but nothing compares to the pizza which I must add was cut in squares.  Orders the 16\" maybe a little aggressive for two people! 
Excited to come back and try the pasta.  Service was quick and great. Shelby was a GREAT server.  Does her job well!"}
{"text":"On my last visit to Tempe my sister brought me to this place. The food here was excellent. We had the pesto pizza and an order of wings.
The wings were excellent. The sauce was very delicious and the wings weren't completely drenched in it. They were very tasty. The pesto pizza was savory. The crust was thin and crispy and the pesto was very good. Excellent pizza place."}
{"text":"WOW been a fan since 2006 when someone from work had a get together at Oreganos in Scottsdale. What's to love? Pasta, garlic cheesy bread (lose your mind good) salads fit for a king and his lady .. Drinks are FRESH and changing it up all the time! Yes I know the \"wait\" but here's my solution go have a cold beverage in the bar while taking in the beautiful aromas of  what will be a delicious meal! The staff always fun and friendly seriously entertaining at times! My fav dish, the big rig w meatballs mmmm such a great price too usually under 13$ a person depending on specialty of course. Still one of the biggest \"bang for your buck\" restaurants left in town that impresses me!"}
{"text":"1st stop in Arizona. Oregano's was so delicious. The pizza, the wings, the bread. All I know is that me and my gal ate way too much..and took some to go. I was very happy I will go back one day =)"}
{"text":"The only downer is the host station. Sometimes it seems like forever before someone says hi.  That's why I gave a 4 Stars.  
Other then that the food is exceptional and the place we bring our out of town guests.  The prices are right and the product is quality.  I haven't been disappointed with anything off the menu except the O-Zone but the verdict is still out. It was good and tasty but very wet. 
The cookies are the best. And priced so perfectly not to be able to say no to at least one. 5$  its a pound. 
These locations get busy and sometimes it's hit or miss but I think. Couples, families, groups seem to go home happy.  I know we do. Now if they can just get their servers to at least be welcoming towards strangers at the front door so we don't stand there all awkward and lost. They'd have a 5 Star."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and try the stuffed pizza. It looks weird and takes a while to make but it is WORTH it. We always bring visiting family to try it out. It is affordable, filling, and delicious. They staff is so friendly and they bring my daughter a ball of dough to play with while we wait. She loves it!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS Stuffed Pizza. Takes a while to get to you but it is worth every minute of it. Also it looks small but it super filling."}
{"text":"\"It will be a 25-35 minute wait\". AN HOUR AND A 20 MINUTES LATER. . we got called but were already at the bar. Good food but they need to buy bigger restaurants.."}
{"text":"On a Thursday at 345, a group of 11, nobody else waiting. .. waited for 30 minutes to be told that we couldn't sit together (that would be a 2 hour wait) and it would be another 30-40 minutes. . I think I spend more time waiting at oreganos than I do dining."}
{"text":"Just ate here with the family, big wine selection for everyone's taste.  I had the Italian stuffed sandwich, which was awesome in flavor, didn't care much for the slaw.  The rest had salads- the big beefstro and the big bombino- they finished every shred of lettuce:)  lots of pasta and meat on the salads!  Don't leave without eating the desert cookie- half white macadamia and half chocolate chip.  Four out of five because our servers switched part way through the meal and my wine came out late.  Everything else was awesome."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Have visited and dined here several times and the food is always superb. Margherita pizza and Bellini's are my favorite but the Caesar salad is good too. 

Warning: Portions are VERY large, best to go with a group of friends and share everything since almost every main dinner dish is too big to eat on your own. 

Nice, comfy and inviting atmosphere with great booths and large seating capacity. 
And I hear that they are expanding! Woo hoo! They can definitely use more room  :))"}
{"text":"You know what is said about crowded restaurants... This, is my fave maragritaville in town! Plus, generous portions all around. Albeit, it is worth the wait, be prepared or dine at the bar. My recomendations? A glass of Earthquake wine, Bellini, or the Anita margarita Cheers!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came on the 4th of July and had a great time. There was a wait to be seated inside so we opted to dine on the patio. The mist wasn't very strong but we were fine in the heat. We ordered the sproccoli stuffed pizza, unaware that it takes 45-60 minutes to cook. Our waitress, Dru, was extremely friendly and attentive and made sure we were comfortable during our wait. We also got a small dinner salad with house italian. It was delicious and a decent portion. Finally our pizza came. It was huge! (we ordered the 10'). We really enjoyed it, but maybe not for such a long wait. However, our time there was enjoyable and the staff is always very welcoming and helpful."}
{"text":"I can see why this place is so busy. I went here with my boyfriend, his cousin, and his cousin's girlfriend. The wait wasn't terribly long, and while we waited we were served drinks--clever idea. The restaurant itself is small, probably better suited for a fast food joint; this is is probably why it's appears so full. There is an outdoor patio, but it doesn't add a whole lot to the limited space.

Anywho, I'm not the biggest fan of pizza/pasta joints; but for my first Arizona pizza, this place was top notch. We ordered the antipasto (my tablet autocorrected that to angioplasty, lmao) and 18 inch half numero one-o and pepperoni pizza. I can't stand pepperoni pizza, but this was the best one I ever tried. It had the perfect crust, cheese, and right amount of sauce without the pepperoni overwhelming everything. My boyfriend is picky about his salad, but he gobbled up quite a bit of the antipasto. The baked cookie dessert was yummy and a great size for four stuffed people just to cleanse the palate a little.  With plenty of leftovers, our bill came out to under $50 (not including drinks from the wait). Good deal."}
{"text":"I haven't  been here in years but lunch last week was fantastic.  I started with a small Caesar salad and then had the big pig pasta.  The pasta was a lunch size and the extra meatball to go with the rigatoni and marinara sauce was perfect.

Service was friendly and I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences I have had with a restaurant. Called when I pulled in before I got my two small kids out to see what the wait would be. Was told that I would have no wait. Walk up to the door and was told that it would be 30-45 minutes. I was super annoyed but we waited anyway. Sat for 15 minutes before our waiter came to take our orders. Luckily he was very nice. Waited 45 minutes before our APPETIZERS came out. Ran out of drinks and could not find our waiter. Finally a manager came over and apologized for us waiting so long for an appetizer. Said she would give us free desert. By the time we finally got our food, we were ready to go home and get to bed.. We had originally planned on running errands after. Food was awful. Decided  to opt out of our free desert because we were afraid to wait another hour. This location was awful. I would never recommend it to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Nice touch on the reservation system: add your name to the waiting list ( wait time posted ) when you are on your way to that must-try rustic restaurant, one of several in the PHX area. Reservations are honored within expected sit time, but enjoy a few minutes at the well stocked bar, tended by a friendly staff. At the table, multiple choices will make it difficult to limit it to only one visit: Caesar salad is one of the best around, perfectly seasoned with the right amount of garlicky dressing. Then enjoy the pasta dishes, where Italy meets Mexico, if you like them hot, you will not be disappointed. Neither were we on our third visit, greeting, food, service, price, consistently close to perfection. No wonder Phoenix, and beyond, noticed. But put your name on the list: smelling without eating is torture.
5 stars, well deserved."}
{"text":"I was so excited for my husband to try this pizza place today. We went in at about 2pm for a date and sat down with our server Charles. He was pleasant and that's why the 2 stars. Our salad came and the flys in the restaurant decided they were eating with us. It was disgusting. They hovered around us the whole time . My husbands was not happy. We couldn't swat them hem away. They kept coming back. The manager came over and apologized over the critters he called them. Flys aren't critters. They carry many diseases . I guess we won't be going back there."}
{"text":"I've been to five different Oreganos in the Valley and each one is pretty consistent as far as food is concerned. All of them get very packed, there's a 30+ minute wait to get seated on weekends and a 30+ minute wait if you want a pan pizza. At least servers tell you that up front.

Servers are pretty friendly too. So much so that multiple friends think they have a shot at dating them by the time we're done eating. 

We've chosen to sit at the bar at the Tempe location to avoid long waits in getting a table. Problem is, and I don't know if they do this at all the locations, they'll charge you for certain soft drinks (mainly soda water) at the bar but never when you're at a table. 

I've never questioned it but I don't understand it. 

Parking is pretty decent here and there's an abundance of chairs in the parking lot and reading material for people who are waiting to get  a seat. There's a large outdoor seating section too, but I don't know if they bring the heaters out there during winter nights like they do in Mesa.

Even weekend afternoons here could warrant a wait. I'd avoid it during ASU basketball games or football Saturdays."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the food is really good. However, the customer service is NOT good. I always feel like I am being rushed. The waiting time is outrageous as it usually is 1.5 - 2 hrs for 3 people when I go. Also the pizza is usually all burned when I received it. Not a huge fan.."}
{"text":"I been to five different Oregano's in the Valley and although I've had bizarre experiences at three of them, some of it was due to the company I was with and not the actual restaurant itself.

As a native northeasterner who appreciates traditional NY style Neopolitan pizza, I'm not a big thick crust/pan pizza guy. Oregano's pan pizza is different though.

Their smallest pie can fill up two people and unlike Pizza Hut (not that I actually eat there), the crust is never greasy and with topping choices like cajun chicken or sundried tomatoes, who can complain? 

Their house salad is great with lettuce options more exotic than your standard iceberg and excellent dressings. Chicken wings are also very good with a mustard flavor that tastes a lot better than it sounds. 

Most customers hate surprises. At Oregano's they avoid surprises by telling you the wait time for a table or that pan pizzas take 35-40 minutes to cook.

I was at the Mesa restaurant on a weekday and our pizza was taking forever. We began dozing off at the table when our server came to us and told us the cooks forgot about us and there will be no charge for the whole meal (including salad we ate earlier) and did we still want to eat the pizza here or take it to go?

It was after 11 pm on a Wed. Following that a manager came to us and told us how he felt when a restaurant when he's in a restaurant and things go wrong and how he reacts to the staff (keep in mind we never complained or even asked about when our pizza was coming). He gives his apologies and tells us a desert cookie will be made for us while our pizza is being finished. That was also going to be free. 

After eating our pizza and sharing the only desert they serve (a large homemade cookie served in the pan it was cooked in with lumps of ice cream on top) we tried to leave a tip on our zero balance bill that the waitress didn't even seem interested in accepting. 

Despite the wait, it was a pleasant experience that someone could realize something was wrong and do something about it without you having to tell them. 

I've also eaten at the North Scotts location, Old Town, Camelback and University in Tempe. All are pretty standard in quality.

If I have some criticism it is that I like my pizza toppings on top of my pizza. At Oreganos they go under the cheese, which makes it hard to get crispy. 

This sometimes prevents me from ordering meats like pepperoni or ground beef. That's okay though, because I like the vegetable options too. 

Also, I've waited nearly an hour on multiple occasions at the Mesa location to get a pan pizza. Other locations are usually closer to their 35 minute estimation."}
{"text":"The garlic bread is amazing! I ordered a salad that would have easily fed 2.  The food was good and the prices reasonable.  Would totally go back!"}
{"text":"I tend to come to Oregano's often when I can't decide what to eat because they offer a multitude of different menu items. This location is always very clean, nice , and busy if you decide to go for dinner on a Friday or Saturday night. The staff are also great and work very hard to please their customers. They do everything they can to ensure your visit there is pleasant. Their food is also a good reason to go back because everything you try is a great option. The types of dishes I get their are usually the pasta or the wings and they are delicious every time. The best thing about Oregano's is their giant portion sizes. Every dish they have can definitely be shared with multiple people because that's literally how much food you are getting. I like to end my meal at Oregano's with a pazookie (cookie shaped like pizza with ice cream) because they are literally the best thing ever especially if you have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"My Michigan family introduced this to us Arizonans.  Lol.  Fun that they brought dough for kids.  Loved the patio.  The potatoe pizza made my pregnant niece need to come back asap.  Thanks for great service ..  Great food.

Today, a little disappointed.  We asked to sit on the patio, because of the kids being cooped up... Took forever to get our beverages, and this is the first time we are being treated as \" customers in passing\". Lack of attention, forgetting one of the kids dough balls...

Officially, worst experience today.  Pizzas were dry.  
Kinda sad that our special day / special meal was sub-par. 
Downgraded my review from 5 to 3.  3 being generous."}
{"text":"D\" Angelo our waiter was amazing.   It was my daughters birthday and he help make it special.  Was attentive to our needs and was courteous and professional.   Definitely makes me want to go to Oregano's again.  Good job D'Angelo"}
{"text":"Loved this place when we lived here...but the last few trips have been-meh.  The lettuce quality in the salads has gone way downhill-iceberg mix all the way.  The Vino Bambino used to be my all time fav.
In addition to the cheap lettuce there was hardly anything else in it.  I ended up leaving almost a full bowl of just lettuce.  Pizza was average and our pizza cookie was WAY under cooked today. I know it's supposed to be a little undercooked, but today was bad.  We didn't realize it until our daughter had eaten over half of it.  Sadly she threw it up on the way home.  Totally bummed-a year ago this place would have been 5 stars all the way :/"}
{"text":"I haved lived in Gilbert for 7 years and finally made it to Oregano's.  Loved everything.  We are a family of 5 and stopped in for a late lunch.  Calamari, Jungle Caesar Salad with chicken, and a large thin crust sausage and pepperoni pizza.  Awesome! Thanks for the peanut butter chocolate chip pizza cookie. Yum! Friendly service.  Best chicken Caesar salad I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service. Caroline is an amazing waitress, very nice and accommodating. Thanks for a great night out with the family. Your service made all the difference. :)"}
{"text":"Solid lunch or dinner destination - stuffed rigatoni is my go-to for dinner, stuffed pizza or calzone of the day is my usual for lunch. 

Decent wine selection as well. 

We live just a mile from here so we often will do a pickup and take home during busier times."}
{"text":"I love pizza, especially Chicago Stuffed Pizza that you can find in the middle of Arizona. If you haven't been to Chicago, or if you have and have been to Girodano's Pizza while visiting there, then you may know that their stuffed pizza is among the best there is. Who knew that a restaurant in Arizona served the same style pizza that actually comes so close to the real thing! Now you must know that the stuffed crust pizza is a work of art, that it HUGE, and thus will take about 30-45 minutes to make perfect. But if you have to be anywhere to wait that long for a pizza, Oregano's is the place to be. Every single one of the waiters and managers will say hi to you as you pass them, even if they aren't the one's helping you. There's great music playing throughout the restaurant, and the outside back patio has a great mural on the wall. You must must MUST check out Oregano's if you are visiting AZ. DO IT!"}
{"text":"This place is FREAKING DELICIOUS. I'll go out on a limb here and say that their wings of fire may be the best wings i have ever had. But be warned. If you order them \"hot\", then that is exactly what they turn out being. HOT. Not \"hooters\" hot, but actually, mouth-numbing, HOT. Capital letters. You will be the mayor of hiccupville. Better order another 24 oz beer. 

The rest of the food i have tried here was also delicious. The Big O'l Ravioli, is literally a single ravioli, that is the size of an airplane pillow. What's not to like about that? Also the pizza cookie TRUMPS the one they serve at BJ's. I wholeheartedly recommend it Oregano's. I also wholeheartedly recommend that Oregano's open a restaurant in San Diego. Please and thank you."}
{"text":"I called at 6:15 to place an order for pick up. I ordered a med thin crust, a 12 inch pan and cheesy bread and they told me it would be ready in an hour.  WTF? it's pizza. I go there and it was of course not ready it took 1hr and 15min to get it. The price was 48 dollars and some change. Holy crap! The pan pizza just looked like a pile of crap. It was a sloppy mess. I was very dissapointed with this location as all the other I have been to have been great. I really don't get the people who will wait for hours to eat here it's not that great."}
{"text":"Okay, so lets talk about what matters, service, atmosphere and food. Price, well, that can vary - but this ain't no budget option.

Service - these guys were great. Happy to accomodate requests and even let us shift from inside to outside dining. Good on ya guys & gals. Half-star credit for that!

Atmosphere - The definition of casual dining. Lively, enjoyable and very laid back. We were there for a business dinner, but had fun enjoying the laid back feel and lively chatter. That gets 1 star from me.

Food - Let's put it this way - I felt like a horse with a salt-lick. Literally. And it just wasn't one pizza, it was all three. The waiter was kind enough to refund our money for the one I complained about, but it was just painful taking every bite. And I like a little salt on my food, so that tells you how bad it was. However, we loved the basket of fries... so that alone gets 1/2 star. Maybe it gets fixed in the future - they admitted they're talking to their supplier about the complaints in the saltiness."}
{"text":"Great food, service & atmosphere!  I wish the wait to get a table was much shorter but definitely worth it!  Amazing salad, pizza, bruschetta & DRINKS!  Very kid friendly & the prices are great!"}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day so we knew there would be a long wait but we decided to wait it out. Luckily we were seated within 30 minutes. We ordered some fried zucchini and those were fantastic and I also ordered a Bellini which was also really good. Next we ordered our main dishes which was pizza, baked ziti, stuffed sandwich and a kids chicken meal. They brought out the kids meal right away which was weird but I figured maybe they didn't want my toddler to be fussy? Well she was able to finish her whole meal before they even brought out ours which took a very long time. They brought out my pizza which was cold and also the baked ziti was served in a bread bowl that was hard as a rock. I don't think it was edible because you couldn't even break a piece off. The only dish that was ok was the sandwich. I really couldn't enjoy my meal because my toddler was ready to leave and play since she already finished her meal. I ended up just taking my pizza home. The service was a little lacking also. We only had water and had to remind the waitress for refills.  I heard great things about this place but I don't think we'll be back anytime soon, maybe just for the bellinis? Just wish it was better than what we got especially on Mother's Day."}
{"text":"Went to this location for lunch today with a large group of colleagues.  We sat on the patio  First let me tell you our waiter was awesome!  Sorry I don't know his name.  He was fast with your drinks, orders.  He made suggestions as we were undecided on what we wanted.  He evenn put on all the fans and evap cooler for us as the sun was beating down even with the umbrellas.  Hey Oreganoes, why not put up the canopy that you were supposed to?  My only beef.  

The food is absolutely awesome!!  But I think you already knew that!  The crust cracker thin, the toppings delicious.  The salads (antipasto and Idon't remember the name of the other one.  The wings were also fantastic, the honey bbq and the garlic parmesan.  Fantastic.  Why our waiter even, without asking, brought us all large to go cups of what we were drinking!  Absolutely the best!  I will be back."}
{"text":"I really love this place. Their pizza is wonderful. I am a sucker for cracker thin crust. The deserts are HUGE we each shared a different one and could t finish. Wait staff are also very attentive   We had a great time, great food."}
{"text":"The place is made up of two small quaint houses with an open air patio in between. We sat in the booth in one of the houses. Seats need replacing. I sank down several inches on one end of the booth, but the other end was fine. 

Onto the food. We ordered a thin crust Numero One-o and an order of calamari. Nothing special to say about the appetizer. The pizza came sliced into squares, but what I noticed first was how thin the crust was! Even better, when I took my first slice, was that the crust was not soggy. The Numero One-o was their traditional combo of toppings. I really loved this pizza and would come back."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat but pizza is ... Eh. Marinara sauce has a strong/funny taste. Pizzookies are good!"}
{"text":"Loved it went their for my birthday and I got a free Pazzooki and not top of that their beer selection is great and their Pizza is pretty awesome. Will highly recommend this location. The staff was very friendly and were attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"Visit date 1/22/16 ~ I really need to catch up on my drafts!

Stopped by after a super long, exhausting day to pick up the best salad in the entire world ~ The Antipasto Thing. 

Friday night at 8:30 and of course they were super busy. I was greeted with a welcoming smile and they started to direct me to the 'to go' gal. I said I'd really like a glass of wine while I ordered. Even though the gentleman (I think he was a manager of some sort, super cute hispanic guy. So annoyed I didn't get his name) was obviously swamped he literally walked me to the bar to make sure I had a seat and let the bar tender know what I had asked for. 

I looked like complete and total hell after spending the last 50 hours at the hospital across the street which of course they didn't know and made the way they took care of me that much more appreciated.

Ben at the bar was fantastic. Promptly brought me a glass of wine, took my order and although the order came out super fast not at all what you'd expect for such a busy Friday night I wasn't quite finished with my wine and he offered to put my salad in the walk in and my bread in the warmer. Very sweet! I said no don't worry I'll have the glass gone before you can even walk back and retrieve it.

They were all wonderful and it was very much appreciated. You never know what's going on in someone's life and even though they didn't think they did anything out of the ordinary, they did."}
{"text":"I can't overstate how much my wife and I love this place. It's one of our very favorite, if not our absolute favorite, pizza places in the country. We make a point of visiting Oregano's every time we're in greater Phoenix. The atmosphere is amazing--it feels fun even if you're waiting for a table. It's cozy all the time. The waitstaff is consistently casual, cool, and friendly--it's been this way for several years, every single time, without fail.

The pizza is outstanding. Fresh avocado sliced on top of a chicken pizza keeps us coming back every time. We've never gone wrong. And the pizza cookie is amazing.

Just adding another 5-star review to a great place."}
{"text":"Craving good, old fashioned spaghetti and meatballs? Look no further than Oregano's Bollo Pasta (Bowl-O-Pasta) special any day of the week - about $7 for unlimited spaghetti...yes please! (They'll even pack up a cute serving To Go for you on your way out.) Craving anything else? Yes, it's probably on the menu. 

Service is friendly, and the manager checked in on us multiple times, too! Sat outside on the patio - a little warm, but it might have just been the piping hot food we were served. 

$5 cheesecake or pizza cookie to finish off your meal is always a must, too. 

The only so-so part of eating at this Mill location is the limited parking. You may have to hover/circle for a few minutes until a spot opens up if it's busy. Not a deal breaker! Thank you Oregano's! Legalize Marinara!"}
{"text":"Kayla is awesome!! A vendor brought us lunch on a very busy day but the salad dressing was missing. Not sure who the manager is but they gave the OK for Kayla to bring us some dressing and a little something extra!! This was a great solution and our office appreciated the thoughtfulness and attention to customer needs. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Best tasting pizza in Arizona.  

If you like good thin, Chicago style pizza, them you need to  order from here.  I spent the winter from Chicago and let me tell you, it was painful to find good pizza.  Then I found Oregano's.  Thank you!

And you cut it correctly - in SQUARES.  YAY!

Forget about NY style pizza, that is greasy, pie wedge, floppy.  Bleh.  

Ordering for pick up is a bit of a pain - they only offer \"pick up times\" and often too late.  This is not a place you can pick up in 30 minutes.  I wish they were get that sorted.

Love me some Pepperoni or Sausage thin crust.  Its got the right salty balance.  So cracker thin, you can eat the entire thing yourself."}
{"text":"I just want to shout out to Kristen M. at the corporate office, who contacted me after this review. She not only apologized but gave me another opportunity to try this location. I went on a week night and just ordered dessert. The pizooki was amazing and I was SO happy to have indulged in such heaven! THANK YOU Oregano's for your amazing customer service...much appreciated. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews, but the service & customer satisfaction I had last week left so much to be desired that I have to share.  To begin with, the dishes & cutlery were FILTHY....& by that I mean dried guacamole on plates, bits of food on forks. The waitress was LESS than concerned & made the party of 3 I was with feel like we were over-reacting.  Then the food:  My sausage sandwich was actually good, although I got raw green peppers instead of roasted red....not a big deal, but my SIL's pizza could have been cardboard for all it looked & tasted.  The worst part was the complete lack of concern the manager showed us.  These were problems due to new staff & not something he was willing to compensate for.  Go back?  Not on your life....a shame really."}
{"text":"I love this place. Friendly employees, great food and a fun atmosphere. The only problem is getting in here. Now that the snow birds are coming back it will be very difficult to get in at any time. Boom dip is so delicious with the pizza crusts served on the side as the bread for this dish, garlicky, soft and warm. The meatball sandwich is one of the best i have had along with the golden wings. I love the pizza, thin crust, thick or pan, it has wonderful flavor and is worth the wait."}
{"text":"If your a fan of thin crust pizza it doesn't get better than this...period.  Also would recommend the dirty monkey cocktails."}
{"text":"Came here for the Chicago style pizza. The first thing that was noticed was the great atmosphere and setting. That really enhanced the experience. We also had a fantastic waitress who was helpful and informative.
The pizza took close to an hour to cook, which they let you know upfront, which was fine by us. The portions are large which is nice if you have a few people with you. We were surprised by how large the salad was. 
The only issue I had was the pizza was \"soupy'. Overall it was good, but when we would take a slice out of the pizza the void would fill in, which was sort of off putting. I could've used a little less cheese as well. I thought the crust was really good and made the pizza unique, but the overloading of cheese made the bottom of the crust hard to find and taste at times."}
{"text":"BEST oreganos I've been to. Usually I go to the Gilbert or Mesa location and wait at least 30-45 minutes and then wait and additional hour for my food. I was able to reserve a spot in line on YELP and once I got to the restraint I waited 2 minutes. I only waited 15 minutes to get my food from the time I ordered. The service was amazing and the food was the best I've had out of all locations. The portions were bigger and the food was piping HOT!"}
{"text":"This place may be a chain, but it offers a good variety large servings of Italian foods, ranging from pizzas to pastas, salads and burgers. I had the Alfredo the Dark, which had a bit of a southwestern twist by using peppers with alfredo sauce, which was a creamy, smoky, and savory treat. The pizza comes with a cracker-like crust, so if you are a fan of New York Style or Chicago Style pizza, this may not be to your taste.

We went here with our friends who are regulars and had a lot of fun joking with their server who was fast, friendly and fun (all you can ask for in a chain restaurant). They have a fun, casual vibe with lots of photos on the wall and big booths. They have outdoor seating with misters to enjoy the AZ heat.

When it comes to Italian food in AZ, and you want to avoid the fast-food feel of other chains or the fancy costs of swanky restaurants, Oregano's hits the spot."}
{"text":"Great outdoor lunch spot explanation point very friendly staff (Kari) waited on us .They have a selection of several lunch specials at a reasonable price. I had the marinara spaghetti, all you can eat and you can add an additional salad for about $2.50. Enjoyed the outdoor seating the service was excellent I would definitely go back here again based on the price, atmosphere & excellent service."}
{"text":"Portions are huge! My husband and I split the REAL BIG salads and are stuffed. My daughter orders pasta and always has food to take home. It's close to home and reasonable. I love this place!"}
{"text":"We have been to Oreganos many times and this evening was one of the worst experiences we have ever had. With the exception of the waitress being polite and apologetic, the rest of the service was below average.  It took over 10 minutes to get just water and my husband had to ask were the beer was as it took another 10 minute to get that. We ordered one cheese bread and one regular garlic bread, out came both cheese bread. They happily took the other away to throw into the garbage. Then dinner. The 12\" pizza was average. Kids each got a kid slice and we're fine. I ordered the Basta Pasta that I have had many many times before. It came with barely warm noodles, no cheese and two olives a couple sun dried tomatoes. The chicken was warm. I said something to the waitress and she happily returned to the kitchen.  When the second pasta was delivered I took one bite and this big chunk of brown something was in the pasta. Myself assuming it was sausage (not suppose to be in the dish) asked the waitress to please take it away. The manager then comes back to our table with the brown chunk to let us know it was not sausage, but chicken skin!!! Really, should of left it at sausage. 

The actual reason we even went out was for our sons birthday (his choice). They both got a cookie desert and both came with ice-cream mush vs cookie and ice-cream on top. When you can't see any of the cookie and the ice-cream looks like whip cream - probably left it sit to long.  

This Oreganos is not what is used to be here and the service surly has slipped. We will defiantly look to dine somewhere alternate that we can hear each other talk and the service is better.  Very happy that there are many more options in downtown Gilbert to dine now."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for a couple months now, and I am sorry it took me so long!  

My husband and I went in on our anniversary and it was a bad experience.  We waited forever to be seated, and then it took a long time to get our food.. other people had come in and sat after us and got their food before us.. needless to say, it wasn't a special experience...

I wrote an email.. and I got a reply back immediately.  They truly felt bad about my experienced and asked me to come back in.  We did, and the experience was nothing short of exceptional.  The food was amazing the first time, as well as the second time, but I'm telling you, they stepped up their game and the service was phenomenal.  

I think there is a lot to be said about an organization that will rectify a problem versus ignore it.  These guys really know what they are doing when it comes to customer service.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"My friend begged me to bring some Oregano's back to Cali.  I didn't think I'd have time but luckily there was one on the way to the airport.  So after brunch my guy hauled ass to this location and I ordered 2 slices to go and since I was in such a rush I asked them to just put the toppings on it, not to bake it, wrap it up and send it my way.  The waitress gave me a weird look but was totally accommodating and even went in the kitchen to make sure they understood my order.  I got one with mushrooms and spinach and one with sausage and pepperoni.  

The pizza \"slices\" were much larger than I was expecting.  I figured 2 slices would fit in 1 box but no I got 2 slices and 2 boxes.  So with my luggage in tow and 2 boxes of oregano's, I was off to the airport.

Baked it the second I got home and it was DELICIOUS!  My friend loved hers too."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm writing this review from a servers perspective. I also came into the restaurant 10 minutes before close. But nothing, not even staying after close, calls for the type of service my friends and I received. 

Tonight I came into join some friends for a meal. First of all, when I got there, my friends who are also servers were already complaining. They did not get sat because it's restaurant policy to not seat until your whole party is there (sorry, my b) but sat at the bar to grab a beer. It took them 20 minutes to get a beer at the bar. 2. 0. I'm sorry, what? It's a Monday and it's not packed at all. That is absolutely unacceptable. It takes about 6 seconds for a 20 oz pour and 10 seconds to ring it in. 

Then they finally got sat (I still wasn't there, so I don't know how) and ordered food. When I got there, it was 9:50, no one greeted me at the door (it happens) but I searched for my party and found them. I sat down and our server got to us about five minutes after. I ordered a beer (a Devils Ale) and surprisingly wasn't offered a menu, which I found to be odd. I mean, at this point I figured the kitchen was still open, as I was unaware that it should have been last call because no one had mentioned it to me. The server definitely didn't, and my friends would have told me if last call would have been done. If I had known, I wouldn't have ordered food. We had to actually ask our server when the restaurant closed. I'm sorry, but not giving customers a heads up about last call is extremely disrespectful to the folks in the kitchen, and I honestly feel bad for the people who work in the back. My apologies.

Another server came back with my beer and it was a Blue Moon. I didn't know if one of my friends had ordered another beer before I got there, or if this was supposed to be mine, but the bartender set it down in front of me and told me it was mine. I told them it wasn't and they took it back, but either the server rang it in wrong or the bartender poured it wrong. Not to mention, the server seemed in a huge rush to get out of there. Understandable, I get it, but don't make mistakes because you're a closer and you want to get out quickly.

Anyways, my friends got their food and I was still waiting (obviously because I had ordered after them). My friend had ordered two more beers, and the bartender dropped them off. She mentioned \"I hope it wasn't a 20 minute long wait for these beers!\" We know it was supposed to be a joke, but it didn't come off that way. It was a little awkward to say the least.

It wasn't a super long wait for food, but it was definitely a wait. When I got my food, it was good, but not great. Honestly, super mediocre Italian food. But that's the recipe and no one can really do too much about that. Not only that but when my food was dropped off, the server, in a rush, asked my friend if she could box up his food when he wasn't even halfway done with his salad. He didn't even have time to respond and she had already gotten the box. 

After the meal, our server cleared our plates, but about five minutes later some girl came by to clear our beer glasses. She had her iPod headphones in (?) and was very sassy and pushy about getting our glasses from us. We were just like ooooohkay calm yo'self, here's the dang glass. No smiles, no nothing. 

All in all, this one star is for the service, not the food. It was awkward and a lot was uncalled for. The food was okay, not the best, but the service could have been a lot better."}
{"text":"Wow.  That's all I've got to say really.. other than GO!  

There isn't anything negative to say about both of my experiences here!  I love the pizza, love the people, the desert is to DIE for, and the service is stellar! 

I started off with Sweet Potato Fries, which sadly had some spice on them that I didn't enjoy, as quickly as they saw I wasn't eating them they removed from the bill and offered any other appetizer for me.  I decline and waited for the pizza to arrive.. 

Wait the 45 minutes, get the deep dish, and be in heaven!  I'm a classic Pep and Cheese guy, but saw a number of others with stuff in them that looked equally delish.  

Finally, do not leave without having the cookie desert, it's phenomenal!  I'd fly back to PHX just for this cookie!"}
{"text":"Thanks to a good friend who brought me here for dinner, I was able to experience this cute little spot!  It was a warm night and we opted to be seated outside so that we could take advantage of the great weather.  I was in a pizza type of mood and decided with the help of our awesome server that I was going to order some thin crust.  But before talking about the pizza, I have to talk about our appetizer first:

BOOM Dip:
Named after our infamous Kaboom Room, it's a delicious concoction of spinach, artichokes and cheeses served with our Italian chips for dipping.  If you like Spinach and Artichoke dip, then this is going to be right up your alley.-- It's oozing of melted cheese and artichoke and the chips are large enough to hold globs of dip into your mouth.  I loved this stuff and if you didn't take it away then I probably could have kept on eating it.  


Clark Street Meat Pizza: (straight from the menu)
It's the spicy meat lover's pizza that keeps on giving. It's loaded with our Chicago sausage, capicolla, salami, garlic, mozzarella, oregano, chili flakes, Parmesan and parmano cheeses, then finished with fresh basil and more parmano. You won't remember your name after a night with this hottie.--I ordered the medium size and it was enough to feed about three people at the least.  The only reason I'm taking off one star is because it was a bit salty for my tastes.  Other than that, they didn't skimp on toppings.

What made this place truly stand out was our server Lily (If I have her name wrong, please forgive me!!).  She was amazing-- took care of us from the moment we sat down and made us all want to come back just so that we could be seated in her section."}
{"text":"I usually love all the Oregano's I've been to, but on a packed Friday night when I just wanted to relax & have a meal with my family, they shoved us outside after putting our name in & waited patiently for approx 35 min. I realized after this that they didn't even ask you what our preference is (like most restaurants do), so now we're out in the cold & their response is \"we have heaters outside\" . NOT the same as inside. Cold chairs and a cold breeze make for a chilly & definitely not relaxing dinner. F this location. I will NEVER come back."}
{"text":"Dirty monkey, Baked Ziti, Pizzuki. Great service, great food, love this location. Long waits to be expected."}
{"text":"Well I was prepared to be totally UNDERWHELMED and I was. My husband persuaded me to give it one more try. It will definately be my LAST!
 ORDER A SALAD AND BE PREPARED TO DIG THROUGH ENOUGH GREENS TO FEED 10 PEOPLE. The ratio of protein to rabbit food is a joke.. the few crumbs of 2 week old dried up shaved beef were not worth digging for. A one gallon container of dressing would have been insufficient. As for my husband's beef sandwich?.....just when was that beef cooked?just how long was it exposed to the air to dry out, in the kitchen? Just how much water can the chef add to the au jus?both this location and the Cave Creek location need help! (RAW CHICKEN THERE) Why is this place so popular? Zero stars not allowed."}
{"text":"First time to eat here. Friends said it was a great place to eat. I had the Grandma G;s Rosemary Chicken Potato Pizza. My Husband had Spaghetti with meat souse. Calamari and garlic bread were very good. We waited, and waited. Waitress kept walking by asking if everything was OK. Other tables that arrived after we did received their main course. We waited. Waitress came by and told us the meal will be ready any time now. we waited. Our meals came out, every thing was great up to this point. My pizza was dry and looked like it had been sitting under the warmer. My Husbands spaghetti was warm and had runny, dull looking sauce on it. Their was maybe 3/4 cup flavor less sauce. Something went wrong with our order, but the waitress didn't say anything. Everyone else's food looked good. We will give this place one more try."}
{"text":"After a few visits to this location, I'd say this is a really bad place if you have kids, and an average place for adults.  At first, you would think it would be fun for kids since they get to play with some pizza dough, but the time you wait for food and the quality of the kids options are terrible.  On our last visit, it took 40+ minutes for kids cheese slices ($2.99/each) and an adult pasta dish.  It sounds cheap but it turns out the slices are stale old pieces that are reheated.  Having to wait 40 minutes with younger children is not fun. 
 Honestly, it would be a much better option to order a full 12\"+ for the kids, at least it won't be stale.  My dish was luke warm, tasted ok, but most of the chicken were bad cuts and hard to eat.  Then the pizza cookie (told it would take 10 minutes) actually took 25.  My kids actually told me that they never want to come back, which they have never said about any restaurant before.  Our server was polite, kept our drinks full, but obviously knows how to play dumb with the slow kitchen.  I was going to give my feedback to a manager before we left but there was nobody around, so yelp it is."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! I love their wings and salads! They have great customer service and good food. I do to-go al ot and call in my orders and I have never had a issue so far. I have dined in and had good experiences as well."}
{"text":"I usually go to Oregano's in Queen Creek which is closer to where I live. But since I had to be at Banner Desert Hospital and saw a Oregano's close by I had to stop. I have yet to order anything at an Oregano's that I didn't like. The servings are more than generous and will usually feed two people or you get to take them home and enjoy them again later. Staff are  always courteous. I would recommend Oregano's to anyone. I love the decor."}
{"text":"I always come here when I am craving a salad and wings! I get the antipasta salad and medium wings. The \"cheesetons\" are sooo good!! I usually get it to go, and they are wonderful and making sure you have everything before you leave! Very quick as well!"}
{"text":"I work close to this location and have come here for lunch many times. The thin crust pizza is very good and they have good lunch specials. If you get the specials the service is pretty quick.

I went to this location tonight with my boyfriend. I ordered the Oregano's Favorite salad and he ordered the Alfredo in the Dark, which was kind of a Southwest take on pasta and cream sauce. I have ordered this salad before and remember is being better. It seemed like it was missing a few ingredients. My boyfriend's pasta was pretty bland, which was a let down because I love Afredo. 

I will stick to the pizza."}
{"text":"Had the Pablo Picasso, and although I got the smaller size, it was quite large. I definitely recommend this salad. It's similar to what other restaurants call a Southwest Salad, but so much better. Lots of veggies and chicken on it. 

I also tried a slice of the Margherita Pizza. It was pretty good, but definitely not the best I've ever had. That said, I've got pretty high expectations for pizza. 

We sat outside at the bar so we wouldn't have to wait. The weather was absolutely perfect for it, which made the experience even more enjoyable. Overall great food and atmosphere. Would definitely go back to check out some of their other pizzas."}
{"text":"Alfredo in the Dark pasta is amazing! The food is quality and five stars. I only give four stars, because of the difficulty to get in and out of the restaurant in Tempe. Parking is a nightmare and the place gets packed during peak hours. Get there early!"}
{"text":"Now I remember why I don't come here.  My friend and I rode bikes up to Oregano's the other afternoon to have lunch.  There was surprisingly no wait and we were able to get a patio table right away.  Our waiter took his dear sweet time getting to us, even though the place was pretty empty.  He didn't know what seasonal beers were on tap.  I'm a mad woman for lasagna and ordered the original classic flag lasagna with sausage; the sausage was so ground up it reminded me kind of like a pate.  The meal wasn't disgusting but I was incredibly underwhelmed, especially for a restaurant that prides itself on Italian food. 

The portions are generous, but I don't particularly want a huge dish of subpar food.  I just think there is better out there."}
{"text":"Five stars for the service, three stars for the food.

I've spent about half of my life in Chicago and am very picky about my pizza.  I'm always on the hunt for some good pizza out here.  Despite the good things I've heard about Oregano's pizza from coworkers and friends, their thin crust cheese did nothing for me...Bland.  

But the warm, gooey chocolate chip cookie mini-pizza hit the spot!  And was tons of fun to share with friends.

I'm giving this Oregano's location 4 stars because we sat on a nice patio area outside and had wonderful service.  Our waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"Just tried out for the first time. I really enjoy the environment. Family friendly. Great food. Really reasonable price. Seth was our waiter. Very great at his job. Ask for him and you won't regret it. The hostess was really nice gave my daughter some pizza dough to play with even though she tried to eat it. FYI sign up for the kaboom club get a free cookie!! Great job Seth. We will see you soon!!"}
{"text":"Hostess got our reservation mixed up. Food took over an hour. Unacceptable service. The yelp app did not work. They need to take reservations."}
{"text":"Love this place. The stuffed pizza is well worth the wait. The hot wings are soooo good."}
{"text":"There are different classes of pizza in this world, barf pizza, bad pizza, meh pizza, good pizza, and oh-my-god-I'm-in-love pizza. Oregano's has pizza better than oh-my-god-I'm-in-love pizza. The sheer amount of amazing that they put into their pizza blows me away. Granted this style of pizza is not for everyone, if you don't like New York or Chicago style pizza (thin crust or deep pan with a tiny bit of spice to both) turn away now. For those who like this kind of pizza, this is the best (that I've encountered) of its kind. The taste of their pizza entirely makes up for any wait that might occur (depending on how busy they are). Their skillet cookies are better then any other I've ever had. As soon as it hits the table my entire family digs in and it's gone in a flash, we all love it (try not to burn your tongue on the heat of the freshly baked cookie). Did I  mention it has ice cream on top of it? My only real complaints with the place is the overwhelming loudness of the music and the long wait for both seating and food. Otherwise this is one of the best restaurants I've been to"}
{"text":"Very pleased with our food and service here. We were greeted right away and shown to a table. 
Our server was Casey. She is new, but her service was out of this world. Oregano's salads are enormous - so enormous that we can share it between two people and it makes a meal. Being especially hungry this evening, we also got the side of meatballs. They were SOOOO delicious. Can't wait to come back. Best Oregano's experience we've had. Thanks for making it wonderful, Casey!"}
{"text":"I like this place! The music can be pretty loud, so makes visiting with friends over dinner somewhat difficult. However, our service has Bern excellent every time we've been there. Be aware - the salads are enormous. My husband and I ordered a large salad to split. We could only eat half of it and saved the rest to feed us both for lunch the next day.
All the pasta dishes are good and the serving sizes are huge!"}
{"text":"Foods great. I love the sandwiches and pasta bowls. The pesto pasta bowl is my favorite."}
{"text":"Wait was a little long and hot....no duh we live in AZ. 

Jason made it all great for us! He was an excellent waiter, and his customer service skills were top notch. 

All our food was great, and he even got our kids food out ASAP. 

Will definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"Yum! The food at all Oregano's is always delicious and I'd have to say the same about this location. Both the food and service is good here. It is very consistent with other locations.

It also is consistent with most other locations in parking - or lack there of. Unfortunately, this is just something you have to take with most locations.

Otherwise, great place to go! You can usually get two meals out of your entree, too!"}
{"text":"This is our first visit to an Oreganos in probably 5 years, and the first at this location. It was a Sunday at 1pm. Nice atmosphere, great service, but surprisingly not good food. Only the zucchini sticks were tasty, crispy outside, juicy inside, and properly seasoned. The big-size house salad was a lot of wilted lettuce, some soggy croutons, and a very few other toppings: two super thin slices of tasteless tomato, 4 somewhat dry cucumber slices. The thin crust Numero One-O pizza was way over-salted, also greasy. This pizza's flavor was nothing more than salt. I could hardly eat 4 small squares. I could see mushroom bits but I could not taste them. Women's bathroom was clean. Menus were encrusted with dozens of food bits on every page, so that was not appetizing. We will not be returning. For the wait time, we might as well make the drive to Mod Pizza on Signal Butte Rd., where both pizza and salad are fresh and ready well within 15 minutes. Thank you."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Just left this place for dinner had the thun crust pizza phenomenal best Pizza I have had in years. To top it off Taylor our Bartender and Server was the friendliest most attentive staff I have encountered in several years. Keep up the good work Taylor you are a rock star."}
{"text":"The pizzas here are great. Actually everything I have had here is great from the pastas to the appetizers. The pizza cookie is delicious. I highly recommend this place if you are nearby."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat if you like Italian food!! I had 10 inch meatball sandwich which was absolutely huge.  You would have to use a fork and a knife to cut the sandwich down and eat it piece by piece.  People are friendly and awesome service.  :-)"}
{"text":"Never been dissappointed here, awesome food and great service with even better prices! Whenever I talk to someone that hasn't been here, I immediately recommend it. There is usually a wait for dinner but it is well worth it, I haven't tried the pizza yet but everything else has been really good. A nice place to take a date or go with friends."}
{"text":"It took them a bit to get organized with the waitstaff, but they guy we had was awesome. Great attitude and totally helpful. We had the pesto thin crust pizza which was so amazing. I also liked the fact that they serve sodas in huge cups so you don't have to ask for so many refills. The ice cream cookie dessert was also really good. For the price, we were really impressed with the service and food quality. Will definitely add this to one of my faves. Only thing was that it seemed to take a long time for the food to come out."}
{"text":"This review is for the heck of a slice pizza lunch special only...great for the price but it doesn't dazzle the taste buds. I ordered mine with mushrooms and black olives and it seemed like they just threw a few handfuls of each on and nuked it for ten seconds. Would help if they added a tiny bit of extra cheese after toppings and put it in the oven for a minute or so to really make all the toppings cohesive instead of just sitting on top."}
{"text":"mini stuffed pizza is the best lunch deal ever!! and the lunch slice is great too. all 3 kinds of pizza is really good.  the pizookie is crazy good. there salads are great too. not my fav chicago pizza in the valley but its still awsome and a must try for any pizza fan in phx!!"}
{"text":"Not bad  - sat at bar and was served $7.00 vodka drinks.  Service is why this gets 3 stars.  Both bartenders were focused on much more than bar patrons.  Bartender must have forgot to place my entree order as once I realized I was suuuuuper hungry, I timed the delivery of my sandwich, 21 minutes.  Yikes."}
{"text":"Amazing time here tonight . So good with great environment. Really enjoyed the pizza cookie and pizza."}
{"text":"This places wait is about the only thing I can't stand. I lived in Italy for 3 years; many dishes cooked for me and I can say that I can't give a 5 for the lack of authenticity. Great food though!"}
{"text":"Usually $25 to $30 each with tip and one adult beverage each. This is upper end for us, but, you usually get a second meal each with left overs, so really half that price?
Golden Wings, Pasta, Pizza, Pizzookie all are awesome!
This place is packed all the time because it is so good, I always walk in the back door and just sit at the bar, much easier and much quicker. The bar gals are awesome, one even looks just like the girl from Smallville, (no perving! She's nice and a great waitress/bar tender). They have the Chick-Fil-A/In-N-Out Burger style service and greetings, I love that!!
Although it is loud, it is still very comfortable, great crowd too, haven't yet ran into a jerk in this place, that's really cool. Parking is tough, its available but be prepared to walk a couple hundred yards. 
Gotta try the Golden Wings, amazing!!
Oh yeh, all the girls that work there are hot!
Enjoy! I always do!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this restaurant.  Its fun and casual.  The service we had last night was poor. Our server was slow, never asked us how we were or if we needed refills.  The food was not the best. I ordered a deep dish, which being from Chicago I was really hoping it would be good, but It was not. I did not like the flavoring, basil? And it seemed a bit under cooked.  The calamari was rubbery.  I would go back because o know their other menu items are good and its a fun place.  I just won't order the deep dish pizza. I guess nothing compares to Chicago!"}
{"text":"How many times I had to ask for extra sauce manager was a douchè when I said something won't be coming back to this one horrible service sub par food"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. The food is amazing, prices seem like your stealing it, and the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Father/Daughter dinner night!
We pulled up and was told an hour to hour and a half wait for a table. Almost left but a quick text from my wife said to stick it out
40min later we were seated and eating our bruschetta totally thrilled that we waited. 
The server was awesome. He was attentive but not to much
We shared a broccoli pizza and the zani ziti
So much food!! Wanted to keep eating but had to try the cookie pizza!

This place is great. Great food. Extremely nice employees ( really appreciate their 10foot rule----- everyone said hello or welcome )
I will absolutely return. And bring the whole family
Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Went with the sausage and meatball as an appetizer.  Both were outstanding.  Our friends had the fried zucchini which was also pretty good. 

We followed that up with an 18\" thin crust pepperoni and sausage pizza.   If we weren't so full,  it'd be gone.   The photo added to this review shows what the 4 of us couldn't finish. 

Definitely would eat here again.   Only negative is that they serve Pepsi."}
{"text":"I feel like this restaurant is everything Olive Garden wishes it were and pretends to be.

This is a fantastic place to go whether your a few friends looking for a good pizza (like seriously, the best thin-crust pizza in Phoenix) and beers in an un-pretentious atmosphere (Phoenix has a lot of pretentious places; this place is delightfully comfortable), or a family looking for a good pizza and beers in an un-pretentious atmosphere.

The patio is great - it's huge - but the interior is comfortable and has a large floor plan with lots of nooks for cozy dining.

I can't think of a better compliment to give this place than saying if I had friends in town, I'd take them to Oregano's before I took them to the yuppie places downtown, and I say that being very self-aware in my yuppie-ness. The pizza's classic and plenty tasty, the atmosphere is more comfortable, and best of all you feel like you're in Phoenix and not a hipster/tourist trap."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Puts Olive Garden to shame. Best salads, pasta and pizza. The servings are huge, so it's great for many people or for a couple to take leftovers home. It's old school setting with really cool decorations. The food and drinks are very well priced. I can't say enough good things about Oregano's."}
{"text":"The Oregano's Gilbert is a brand new location. Great news for Oregano-lovers on this side of town. Great news for anyone looking for yummy pizza and pasta and a warm, friendly setting.

Oregano's has a fun, retro look, and the patio dining is recommended except for the warmest months of the year. Their menu offers the typical choices: salads, breads, wings, pizza, pasta plus some original takes on traditional Italian dishes. The soups are definitely a cut above what most Itallian eateries offer -- wait, most DON'T offer. Try the Jumbo Gumbo or Itallin Wedding Soup, both are terrific."}
{"text":"The wait is usually long if you are going anytime around mealtime.  Not an issue if you don't have kids to entertain.  But we do.

The waitresses could use more clothing.  I suppose their kind of attire is better for the Tempe location next to ASU, but I really don't need my kids seeing your rack and booty hanging out.  This isn't supposed to be Hooters.

Also, the food is very, very salty.  The last couple of times we had pizza and soup and it was hard to eat because of so much salt.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I rsvp on Yelp and our table was ready within minutes of arriving. The bartender was very friendly he made sure we were happy with our drinks before we left the bar, to head to our table.
Food portions are great value for your money.
Service is always excellent. If your looking for a good pasta place, this is it!"}
{"text":"Have not been to this busy chain restaurant before because of crowds and long evening waits but tried it for an early lunch. One member of our group has a soy allergy; the waiter offered \"lettuce with lemon\" no olive oil, no pasta, no pizza, no chicken because EVERYTHING was tainted with soy. The person who has the tree hugger skillet seemed satisfied with the hot veggie combo. Average service.  Bottom line: this was unusual for an \"Italian\" restaurant and not the best option."}
{"text":"Man this place does it right!  They hit my three areas for a review right on the money every time; service, food, atmosphere.  

I'm stoked that they have opened a couple more locations other than in the east valley.  I hate, hate ,hate waiting to eat, but for this place I make an exception.  It's worth the wait. I love to hit this place right around 2:00 or 3:00 and we walk right in and watch the dinner crowd line up as we finish up our meal.  

The drinks are good, the beer is cold and everything I have ever ordered was great!  The cheesy garlic bread is a must have.  I also really enjoy the holy guacamole dish.  It's a huge cheesy tortilla with a hefty helping of guac, it's awesome.  My go-to entre is the alfredo-the dark with chicken.  

The atmosphere is casual and energetic.  I love the quality of the servers.  It truly seems everyone loves working there.  It's always clean and the food is always consistent. 

I'm amazed at how reasonable the prices are for the portion size and quality.  

It's pretty simple, if you haven't been....go.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Poor service and it wasn't even busy. We waited over an hour for our food!!! We are not impatient people but this was horrible and after we ate there (the food was good don't get me wrong) I went home and was sick as a dog that night. Not sure if something was not cooked all the way or it could have just been me. But regardless we waited about twenty mins to get seated (again not busy at all) then waited another twenty mins for the waiter to take our order then another hour for our food. We only went here because we had a gift card. Never again."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and decor. The staff was incredibly friendly, energetic, and attentive. The food was above average, though the presentation was a bit sloppy. This may just be their style, but I prefer a more tidy plate when my food arrives. Overall I was impressed with the flavor and portion size, though a little more garlic bread with the meal would never hurt anyone. Prices were a bit higher than I would've expected but not unreasonable for the experience. We arrived on a Friday at lunchtime and there was no wait. Had a choice of patio or inside dining, we chose inside so we could look at the fun decorations. I'll definitely be back, great vibe for a date or a girls day/night out."}
{"text":"The food to begin with was outstanding, however the service was what made it such a great experience. Our server Kelsey was on top of everything and was very sweet. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We lived in AZ for a year and went here about 5 times I'd say.  We still talk about it.  Love the atmosphere and don't even get going on the food... we loved it!  If we ever visit AZ again we'll be going here."}
{"text":"It's hard to say anything negative about this place. The prices are so reasonable, the food is consistently good, and it's a fun atmosphere. I love their frozen bellinis. I can't go without having one. They are super strong too-be careful. Their wings are the best in the valley. Super meaty and delicious. We mix medium with Italian gold-so good. Their plain old thin crust cheese pizza is what we usually go for; sometimes we throw on some sausage. The pesto pie is also good. Their salads are delicious too. Waffle fries! Yes, please. Stuffed 'shrooms? Ok! (Huge and filling). You can't leave without a pizzookie (pizza cookie topped with cream--go for the classic chocolate chip). Be prepared for a wait for dinner especially in nicer weather. This location isn't too bad to wait at--they have cornhole."}
{"text":"Typical great food at Oreganos. Had a 12\" assorted topping pizza which I would give 10/10 for. I can't recall ever having a bad meal at Oreganos. 

Jackie the bar made is either short staffed or just not the best c/s person. I believe it's the former but ultimately that reflects on management. If you don't have enough bar staff how can you expect your employees to be happy and pleasant behind the bar?"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza that you can order with a choice of up to 20 or so toppings. I recommend the thin crust pizza over the deep pan. Service is usually very good whether you choose the bar or table service. Great consistent atmosphere. The only downside is that during peak hours there is sometimes a wait. However, that's to be expected if you want good food."}
{"text":"I knocked one star off for the slow service. I know it's a hot spot but management could do a better job of managing their work force schedule. It's a regular occurrence. Food is always 10/10 in quality and portion size. It's my favorite pizza bistro on the planet but sometimes the slow service can be a buzz kill."}
{"text":"Pizzas are good, Italian dishes are fantastic and the ambiance is nice. Great staff and excellent food! Tip: the side order of meatballs are out of this world! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Oregano's for as long as I can remember. It's definitely a staple of amazing locally owned AZ food. The guacatony is the best thing on the menu, a thin thin thin pizza crust with garlic, onions and herbs served with a huge pile of italian-inspired guacamole. I order this baby every time I come here. Other awesome thing about Oregano's is the beer selection and prices. Pitcher of Fat Tire for only $12? Sounds good to me! I am a big fan of their salads, when I used to eat meat their antipasto was amazing. Pizza is great great great. Thin and large! I like eating my pizza in square and mini-triangle end pieces. I always enjoy my meal at Oregano's. Some gripes include long waits, as the restaurants are rather small, and sometimes less than awesome service, but only sometimes. Oregano's is always a great spot to meet up for drinks and excellent food. I heard they are expanding the chain to other states, here's hoping SF gets one! I miss you Oregano's!!!"}
{"text":"If there is a better thin pizza west of NYC I'll eat my hat. Or the pizza. 

Just beat the rush in on Fri 5 pm, they seat you quickly when there are available tables, but, most of the time, you wait for a few minutes. 

Wife had ziti, me the thin sausage pizza, and we both love it just as much as ever. If only there was one of these in Show Low. 

5 stars."}
{"text":"Oregano's was the best! You walk in and feel like family. While waiting for a table we got offered to sample some amazing pizza while having ice cold beer on the patio. Once we got sat our fabulous waitress Jessica took amazing care of us. Great food! Great service! Can't wait to be back next Sunday! :)"}
{"text":"I was delivering an order of lasagna and chicken caesar salad to a DoorDash customer. After dropping off the food and driving away, the customer calls and said there was no chicken in the salad. I went back to the restaurant, not expecting them to believe me, especially since I didn't have the food anymore. 

Surprisingly, when I explained what happened to the tall, sexy man who was managing the kitchen, he didn't even question me. Instead, he hollars back to the cooks to give him two side orders of chicken.  He handed them to me and sincerely apologized for the initial chicken exclusion.

I was so impressed by his great customer service, I just had to offer appreciation on here.  Keep up the good work, Oregano's!"}
{"text":"The worst of all the oreganos locations. Pizzas are undersauced for the oreganos standard. Don't bother trying to place orders for pickup, wait times are insanely long (2 hours for a take out delivery?? Really? Really??) top it all off with terrible customer service. Just go to Spinatos if you're considering this location."}
{"text":"I called to make reservations a week in advance for a birthday party of 15 and while I was told they didn't take reservations, the man I spoke with was very confident that they would be able to accommodate us. He said he would make a note of my party size, have a group of tables set aside, took my name, and we were good to go (or so I thought). I showed up at 6pm just like I was instructed (30 minutes earlier than the party time) and was greeted by a very unhelpful hostess. She said she was not informed of the party and couldn't seat us for 2 hours. TWO HOURS?!? She provided no additional suggestions or options and asked us to take a seat. I'll take my business and tips elsewhere, thanks."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food and service always great, last night no exception. Thin crust pizza, deep dish pizza and salad all excellent. Service attentive and friendly. Sat outside in the patio area and it was a beautiful evening for our party of seven. Look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Oreganos on Elliot in Tempe. Service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I tried to make a reservation for a large party three days in advance, the gal that answered the phone was very polite and told me Oregano's doesn't accept reservations. Yet, she assured me that I would be able to get a table for 11 people at 5:45 with an approx 20 minute wait. Surprised, I asked her if she was sure, she yet again assured me that it would be no problem. Being new to the area and excited to try new restaurants to add to my stomping grounds, my only choice was to trust the employee.

I called again on Saturday, thinking certainly Oregano's must take a call ahead for a large party. Yet again, I was told 20-25 min wait, \"even in the dinner rush\", would be no problem.

My party of 11, including my 94 year old grandmother, arrived happy and hungry at 5:30, anticipating the 20-25min wait I was promised. To my surprise, the hostess looked up at me and said \"Awe I'm sorry, it'll be an hour and 45 minute wait. But don't worry, it goes by quick!\" I explained that I called TWICE, to which she replied to the effect of, \"sorry its just our policy to not take reservations and accept our customers as they come\". When I tried to tell her of my great grandmother who didn't even have a seat to wait in, the hostess said \"I'm sure one will become available shortly\" and shrugged her shoulders. Yes, you read that correctly, SHE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS. I am happy to know that that young girl will never be responsible for taking care of me when I am elderly.

I quickly decided this is not the place for us, no matter how good I am told the food is, I can not let my 94 year old GG stand for AN HOUR AND 45 MINUTES.

We loaded up our crew, drove down the street to Casanova's Brother's Pizza. That place is DELICIOUS! I showed up was told a 15 minute wait, even though the place was packed, and my party was sat within 10 minutes. Look at that, a place that doesn't lie to their customers, this seems to be a dying breed. The waiter was polite, and even held the chair out for my great grandmother. If you're still reading, try out that pizza its great!

The next day, Sunday I emailed the Oregano's customer service line, then found a number and called just to be sure to get a response. 

Monday - nothing.
Tuesday - nothing.
Today, Wednesday - I waited until after 4pm to give the phone number a call.

To my surprise, someone was there and working, I was shocked because it doesn't seem that she knows how to pick up a phone and dial my phone number. I explained my story only to receive the same response I got from the rude hostess. \"I'm sorry we just don't accept reservations, even if it means loosing large parties\". I thought surely this customer service representative would show some concern when I mentioned my great grandmother, yet she seems to be busy with another project, as the sound of her voice was in and out as if she was stretching away from the phone. Now, she did say she would take up this issue with the locations manager. I for some reason (eye roll) have no trust in these employees, especially since I was given a copy and paste response.

Maybe I'm just old school but I believe in REAL customer service. I have been known to call my customers on their birthdays and send a congratulations letter when someone marries. I'm not sure where the American customer service field is headed but I truly hope Oregano's is not leading the pack."}
{"text":"I live in Chandler, if I lived close by I would BEG  the manager for a JOB in his kitchen.  
 I would love to learn how to cook this amazing.  Thank you. I will be back.  Promise
OC.."}
{"text":"So this place is one of the few places in town where I'd refer people to go if they wanted to get a Chicago style pizza. It's freaking delicious! On this particular visit, I had a monster salad and my daughter had a spicy pasta. Service was great as we started out on the patio and moved inside where our server helped us get situated (I forgot about my daughter's fear of birds...IDK...don't ask me??).  Wasn't able to tackle the whole salad so I packed it up to go and then made plans for my follow up visit to get my cheat meal pizza later that week. The atmosphere is great and the staff is usually more than friendly and upbeat. 

Ya'll need more locations in town though...just sayin! ;)"}
{"text":"Very busy, 20 minute wait, and well worth it! We started with the big Caesar salad and it was fresh crisp, and just the right amount of cheese, dressing, and croutons. We then had their version of guacamole on thin crust pizza, delish and filling! It's like 5 servings of Chipotle Guac with an Italian touch. We tried their deep dish with sausage and pepperoni and it was sublime. Well cooked cheese, crisp crust on the outside and soft on the inside. The 12\" is enough for 4-5 people, yummy! The service was very hospitable and friendly but not overbearing"}
{"text":"We've heard all the hype on this place but never went.  Man am I sorry for all the missed opportunities!  It's worth its reputation!  Pan pizza and chicken Parmesan were fantastic.  But the wings, ohhhhh wow.  Also the cheese bread was gone in a flash.  Our waiter, DJ, was knowledgeable, made fantastic recommendations and could not have been nicer.  One of the best servers we've had in a long time.  Next time we return, we're coming here again!"}
{"text":"This review is for catering.  I thought it would be a nice change to have Oregano's cater my party instead of making food myself.  The order was easy to make and it was ready at the agreed upon time.  However, every dish I ordered tasted the same, as if the descriptions of each entree were irrelevant to what they actually made.  I was disappointed.  Everything tasted good but what's the point of having several trays of food that all taste the same?  It was so boring!  I won't have Oregano's cater my food in the future."}
{"text":"Pizzas are salty. All the time every time. I don't know why 
My kids think it's gonna be better next time. No matter what kinda of pizza it's going to be salty. They also use cheddar cheese on most pizzas.  The salads are good and we have had the Pablo Picasso a couple of times.  The dirty monkey drink I ordered was mostly ice so the next one I ordered I asked if I could have \"light ice\" and when she brought me this the glass was just over half full to \"compensate\" for the \"light ice\".  This was odd in my opinion. The first Dirty Monkey I had was so full of ice that it was all that hit my lip as I drank it."}
{"text":"Oreganos has a good vibe and a large menu. Lots of pasta options, pizza, soup, and salad. There is sure to be something for everyone. We sat outdoors which was quite nice. They even have overhead heaters to keep you warm as it cools down in the evening.

I was not very hungry so I just ordered the Italian wedding soup for my dinner. The bowl is quite large and is very filling. They serve it in a pizza crust bowl which looks cooler than it tastes. I found that the bowl tasted either dry and flour-y or almost sour. The soup more than made up for it though. It has lots of little meatballs and one large one in a chicken broth. I would order it again."}
{"text":"We are transplanted Chicagoans, so Oregano's is the only pizza in Arizona for us.  But they really have to do something about the barware they use.  Really, the cheapest thing you stock your bar with is the glassware.  
I ordered my usual vodka rocks with a lemon. What came to me looked like a shot glass, with a little alcohol in it and this oversized lemon wedge.  If it wasn't so pathetic, it would have been comical.  I really should've taken a picture of it.
After complaining to the waiter, thinking he brought me a shot, he went and got the barmaid, who explained to me that they really don't consider themselves to have a full bar - it's actually a \"mini-bar\" - and no, they don't have rocks glasses, and this drink is the requisite one and a half shots of liquor.  \"Sorry,\" she said.
The pizza was good, as usual.  Just was disappointed at this, what seemed tacky, situation with the glasses."}
{"text":"Excellent service, fair price, superb food! We got the \"Alfredo the dark\" & \"big rig\". Both were very unique, not a copycat of something else I've had elsewhere. Big rig has a Chipotle cream sauce with a light kick, and the Alfredo the dark has a light but perfect jalapeño flavor to it without the heat. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We were sat immediately. Our server was very helpful since it was my first time. He was quick with our order and brought the food out quickly! Checked up on ya often to make sure we were doing ok. The food portions are rather large and I was upset I couldn't finish it all because it was all so good!!!! Try the nachos they have on the side menu, get them to share their very good and rather filling. Hope they come to San Diego soon!"}
{"text":"My wife, 18 month old and I had lunch here the other day.  First time we had been there. After getting seated, ordering drinks, and getting our daughter set up the waitress awkwardly came over and said her boss wanted us to move in order to use our table for a larger group.  We politely told her that we did not want to move.  Five minutes later the manager came over and tried to bribe us to move with a free appetizer.  Again we told her we were not moving tables.  Very rude people!  The food was average at best.  I can get a better sandwich at Jersey Mikes or Firehouse.  There were flies all over to add to our lovely experience!!  WILL NEVER BE BACK!!"}
{"text":"Since I'm from
Chicago we have the best pizza, my boyfriend swears by their chicken BBQ pizza, well done., it was really amazing! Their salad list is the most unique salad array I have ever seen at a pizza place, we got the Pablo Picasso and some kind of loaded Ceaser! Yum! Drinks are huge. Service is good for a pizza place, the half baked cookie with icecream is a must! This is the first oreganos in az, and we went back on our way home to Chicago. My boyfriend wanted to bring one back for his friends but we couldn't figure out how to bring it back"}
{"text":"I don't know what is happening to Oregano's. I don't know if it's just this location or all of them, but the service here has gone so downhill that my husband and I can't force ourselves to come back. 

During our most recent visit, my husband had his entire meal (sandwich, fries, and ketchup) dumped on his lap. I couldn't stop laughing at the time and the server was very apologetic, but it was pretty brutal. Stained shorts and everything. What was especially surprising was that after waiting another 15 minutes for a new sandwich, we were still charged full price for the meal. Really???

Oregano's, your food is still pretty decent and the lively atmosphere is great, but you won't catch us dining here anymore. We wait forever for our food, are often ignored by our servers, and now this stellar experience. No thank you."}
{"text":"I honestly use to hate this place and I'm not sure why? Maybe I was in a bad mood from being hungry? Not sure anyways I wanted a good pasta meal and I'm so happy I gave Oreganos another try. I got the egg plant parmesan and got a lot of it ! And for only $9! Gosh I was so full with only half the dish, my boyfriend got the chicken parmesan sandwhich and he loved it just didn't enjoy the side of sweet potato fries. The only down side was the hostess telling us 20-25 mins and we ended up waiting 45 mins but got us seated shortly after I asked how much longer. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I eat here every Sunday. The have football on the TVs out side. Not a place to go for the football rather the wings. Such good wings! The other reason men like myself eat here are the well endowed women. They have beautiful haboobies here they make me want to go motorboating!"}
{"text":"Meh. The thin crust pizza doesn't have enough flavor to cover up the bland crust. I guess I'm used to better pizza back home, or anywhere really. There's even a brewery within walking distance of my house in Denver that makes WAY better pizza & their specialty is supposed to be beer...."}
{"text":"Great pizza and big portions. We can never finish the small salad with 2 people. The stuffed pizza is amazing. The only thing is there is always at least a 35/45 minute wait. But they pass out pizza samples outside while you wait."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place such a low rating because the food is actually pretty decent. Our visit was pretty terrible. Once we sat down and ordered, it took at least 45 mins for our food to come out. Anyone that has been to dinner with small children knows how awful that is. They ended up bringing out the kids food first so that they could at least eat. The adults food came about 5 minutes later. My wife ordered the big rig pasta with chicken off of the gluten free menu. When the food came out, the gluten free pasta wasn't cooked fully and there was no chicken. We ended up sending it back and just ordering the same thing to go for her. I ordered the zany ziti. The pasta was ok but not enough sauce for my liking. Pretty unfortunate experience at a restaurant that we usually like."}
{"text":"Don't let the wait scare you. Both times I've been this week we were seated way before the time given to us. Service was good but a few mistakes were made (obviously still training wait staff). Great atmosphere and prices. Wish more beers were on draft. The cocktails though were great and the pizzaookie!!! Amazing. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Didn't go in here expecting much. Being from Chicago, I craved some really good deep dish pizza and saw this place made it, so I stopped in.
Parking was tight. Small parking lot in the back with little to no parking on a busy night...
There was a half hr wait but we seated instantly at the bar. Not my ideal seating but I don't like waiting, so it is what it is.
Bartender was friendly. Tried the Belini? An alcoholic slushi drink someone else had posted a picture of. I could be completely wrong on the name. Wasn't as strong as I'd like, but tasty.
We got a big caesar salad to start. Was big enough for two people. Was just ok...kind of dry in my opinion. Definitely could've used more dressing. Probably wouldn't get again- their other salads look a lot better anyways.
Somehow in all this, we changed our minds about deep dish (sorry chi town), and went with a \"make your own\" thin crust. I got sausage, pepperoni, spiced feta, roasted garlic, and spinach on my half and my husband got sausage, pepperoni, garlic, and bacon on his.
I was a little worried about my choices and how they'd turn out shortly after we placed the order. Those ingredients can definitely overwhelm a pizza. The wait was usual...half hr maybe?
Lemme tell you.....that pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten.......they didn't put TOO much of each topping, so you didn't get too much of one flavor overpowering another (aka garlic or feta). Everything blended perfectly and was so stinkin delicious I never wanted it to end......my husband loved his just as much. 
Overall for the salad, pizza, 2 beers, 2 \"specialty\" drinks, and a tip....the final bill came to around $77. Kind of expensive in my opinion. Adding your own toppings individually can get kind of pricey so I'd probably get a pizza off the menu choices next time? Even though the make your own combo I got was DIVINE....
I'm giving this place 4 stars because despite some minor setbacks, the pizza was absolutely PERFECT. The pricing dissapoints me the most really. If it were cheaper, I'd frequent here once a week. Lol."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with this place. Always great food and great service. Only way they could be better is if they delivered ! =] 
One of my favorite places. If you have never been, it's a MUST go to."}
{"text":"Decided to come by right when it opened and was surprised that nearly all of the tables were filled! We were seated in Renee's section and were quickly greeted with a warm smile. After taking our drink order, Renee asked if we were in the mood for a starter. We inquired about the stuffed mushrooms and she said they were a great choice. Once they arrived, my boyfriend and I throughly agreed. Since she had done such a great job with the app, we asked her advice on lunch. She knocked that one out of the park as well! Thank you Renee for making our visit awesome."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND 

My trainer told me that I need to eat more fresh veggies. I told him that I don't hate veggies, I just hate how they taste when I cook them. I always wind up cooking them via steamer and they're always too bland. So my trainer took me to Oregano's. 

THE STORY

My trainer couldn't stop praising Oregano's salads, so we went. When we walked in, it looked and felt like a corporate restaurant chain, with heavy \"flair\" decor, like a TGI Friday's or Chili's. 

There were two hostesses who said it was fine to sit at the bar. 

My trainer ordered us a chef's salad with a side skillet of fresh broccoli. Both were DELICIOUS!!  I had no idea this place existed, and apparently, Oregano's is known for their huge salads! 

Since then, I have been back and have tried their Cesar salad, mixed salad with chicken on top and the beefstro.

Each salad is HUGE (see pics). Heaps of lettuce and meat all seasoned to perfection. The farm skillets are AMAZING! I love the sautéed mixed veggies skillet and the broccoli skillet.

I usually just pop in for the salads. But I do like to glance at everyone else's food, which looks fantastic!

Today I tried dessert: The original pizza cookie, which is more than a 1/2 pound of white chocolate and macadamia nut cookie dough, half baked in a 6\" pizza pan with vanilla ice cream on top. SUPER YUMMY!! (see pic)

ABOUT OREGANO's

According to their website, Oregano's says it's a family restaurant from Chicago, based on grandma's own recipes. I'm not sure if that's the truth. It looks like a chain, similar to TGI Fridays, or Chili's. It seems that grandma hasn't been in the picture in years and years, assuming there was a grandma.

SERVICE EXPERIENCE

There is always a bunch of fun, young servers. Today, my server was Colin, who was efficient and friendly. This location of Oregano's is always clean and the servers are always polite; it seems to be run by management that keeps a tight ship.

CONCLUSION

Oregano's salads are legendary. Oregano's is always clean and well kept. The staff is hip but not overly talkative. 

I'm definitely coming back!

It's 4/5 \"Phoenix Stars\" equivalent to 3/5 International.

4/5 RECOMMEND

{"text":"I Love Oregano's and can't believe I have never written a review. This is my regular place. The best thing about Oregano's is the Bellini's and the staff. The food is pretty good and is a good value. Usually order the Pablo Picaso Salad (amazing) and the Alfredo the Dark Pasta with Shredded Chicken. The toasted Ravioli apps are yummy. This place is always busy, so expect a wait even during the week. The best time to come is after 9pm in my opinion. I have seen the wait as long as two hours, no joke. They don't take reservations and all the party has to be there for them to list you. Choose inside, outside or first available. You can order a drink and even apps for the wait. This is basically a bar that sells food so leave the kiddos at home. They will not enjoy it here, you will not enjoy it here with them and everyone else will not enjoy it so take them to McDonalds and leave them with a sitter. You deserve a night out anyway.

The Pizza Cookie is really good. I like Chocolate Chip/Peanut Butter. The servers here really work their buts off. They will do most anything to make your meal here a great one. They even chit chat with you if you like and make you feel special. I never tip under 20% here and feel I get my money's worth every time. 

They seem to have been turning over help more in the past couple of years. They have a solid business and I attribute that to their growth, but for the most part the employees seem to like working there.

My only real beef aside from the wait is there are only two bathrooms. One Male and one Female. As many customers as this place has they need to figure a way to add dividers and make it so more can use as there is always a line. The parking is not a big deal to me. They have a small lot, but there is PLENTY of street parking nearby and if there is not, then you need to come back at a different time because the wait will be a killer."}
{"text":"Being a regular at the Oregano's on Camelback, I was familiar with the deal. I was waiting for friends to see a movie and figured a Bellini and some Toasted Ravioli would do the trick. The staff at this location are pleasant and the service is good, but it is not the same. They take your order and bring your food but no small talk with the customers in general. The crowd was not what you would expect either. It was neither the North Scottsdale Snobs, nor the Gay feel of Camelback.  It was a strange mix of families with kids and older (over 30, not that that is old, just comparing) couples. The food and service was good, but the place was small. My one beef would have to be the bathrooms. They should make all their bathrooms unisex since they only have on male and one female, but this location actually has a baby changing station and I waited for about 20 min while a guy changed his kids diaper. Not so much a big deal (Do you really want to bring kids to a bar though???) if the bathrooms were unisex. Love it since it is Oregano's but not the same as Camelback."}
{"text":"So last night we had our going away party and I can't begin to express how awesome they were to us! We were all seated in the same area and got top notch service. I don't know that I've ever received better service for a large group (30+ people). Thanks for giving us a great last night in Arizona guys!"}
{"text":"This was a goood pizza. I'm from NYC and my gal is from Chicago so pizza is kinda like religion to us. So For a pizza in the middle of the desert this place rocks. We were happily surprised I would have given it 5 stars but the hostess was very rude and had bad energy. Nevertheless if you're in The Phoenix/Chandler area and want pizza go there."}
{"text":"Not a professional establishment. I've never had a chair break on me in a restaurant. I realize that I'm larger than a standard person at 6'3\" and 300lbs, but if you serve something titled the big rig geared towards the types you see in a Coppola film, you should anticipate some above average size people. 
Accidents happen, as a paramedic supervisor I understand that, but a seemingly annoyed manager who does absolutely zero to offer some type of resolve other than \"a bag of ice or something,\" has earned a permanent lost customer."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. The shrimp scampi is top notch. Calamari is excellent. Can't go wrong with the unlimited spaghetti either. The wait can get a little long but it's worth it. Do not go here if you hate spice food."}
{"text":"Love this place! The smell of Italian herbs is intoxicating when you walk in and instantly makes you hungry.  The pizzas are my favorite but pasta was good too. Best appetizer: cheese bread...buttery, soft super cheesy!"}
{"text":"So this is our new neighborhood pizza joint! The wait was about 10 minutes. The staff is super friendly! Kelsey our server was so patient in exploring the menu with us! The manager Ann came to our table to welcome us to the neighborhood and gift is a pizza cookie for dessert!!! 
We were missing Oreganos in Our Great State of Texas! 
Our Thin crust pizza was delish and came out quickly. The Chicken Parm was more than enough for two! 
We can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"What a difference it makes when a manager/owner cares about the voice of their customers. Service was way better than back in August when I came in. Food was on time, servers were on their A game and the manager was making his rounds making sure everyone was enjoying their food. Im glad I came back to give this place a second chance. 5 stars well earned!"}
{"text":"Midday lunch options are awesome! Big portions for a good price and quite a few options. Love stopping in for lunch! Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Great salads/pizza and fun place for families!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner during the week last week. Service was quick and professional. Ordered two pizzas and a family-style salad to start things off. The portion sizes are large. Waitress kept our drinks refilled without even asking. Loved the cookie and ice cream that comes in a cast iron skillet. The food here is excellent with equally excellent service."}
{"text":"yum yum yum. I love Oregano's Pizza! I've always loved Oregano's... but especially the last time I went. There was a long line outside and the wait for us was 30-45mins, which I thought I was going to dread...but the servers were really nice. We were able to order drinks in the waiting area and they even came by us several times to give out pizza samples."}
{"text":"Look, your family consists of hard-to-please, cranky, cheap, drunken, indecisive, peevs who would just as soon hop on a plane back to Clifton, Iowa than have dinner with you ... but your parents like em, and hell, mom and pop are paying for you to have a little din-din while the entire fam is visiting little ol' you in Phoenix, Arizona.

Luckily, Oregano's will help you with your little problem.

They've got wine, oh yeah.  And at a great price.

They've got an large, open waiting area with comfy seats.

They've got a cozy setting hidden just off of a bustling avenue.

And they've got the kind of food that can please everyone.  That means everyone from your crotchety grandfather who hasn't dined out since the 60s to your Mountain Dew infused punk of a cousin who likes to urinate on animals.  

Here ya go.

I really REALLY like their lasagna (though not good for group dining cos it takes 45 mins, yo) and I want to marry their garlic bread.  Sharing pizza is good all around, and the presentation is nice.

When you get to the Pizzookie, you know you've done your best to keep familial relations on good terms for at least another year, or until you're dining at the Des Moines Shoney's next Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"I'm not Italian and probably they will all be criticizing my 5 stars, but as an American girl, this is my favorite Italian restaurant (and I have spent most of my life in NJ / NYC and some years in Chicago). lol  Tempe ASU location is the best because the ambiance is fun!  You may be in for a wait though...just bring some friends and hang out and the wait will be enjoyable.  :-)

When I was a student, I would order the bowl o pasta - free refills of pasta!  I think I used to get it with marinara and chicken.  The pasta is angel hair - it is delicious.  Also, try the garlic bread with cheese.  :-)  I used to also get the desert - chocolate chip cookie in a pizza pan with ice cream - out of this world!

Last time I went, I got the thin crust pizza with pepperoni and green olive.  So good, so good.

I have taken many a friend here and they always remember the place and want to go back."}
{"text":"Soooo good - Great thin crust pizza. Fresh, large salads. Italian at its best.
The sangria's were just OK, but I really enjoyed the atmosphere and food.
The service was fine.
The food was really good - I haven't had thin crust like this since St Louis Imo's pizza - and it made me very very happy!
The crowd is diverse, and the atmosphere is a bit loud, but ll in all a fun place to share a meal, and that's all that matters sometimes."}
{"text":"3:00 there was a 20 minutes wait for a table in the dining room, we went outside and got a table right away, but no one waited on us so we went to the bar.
Lexi at the bar is the sweetest and most friendly person we've met in a long time. Not to mention very knowledgeable and attentive."}
{"text":"Its Tuesday, day after a holiday and we are just slammed at work, so some coworkers and I thought ahead and picked a place or order lunch from and pick it up and bring it back to the office .

Today the vote was for Oregano's, I personally had not tried them up until now, but I always see that the place is pack! 

I looked at the menu we had floating around here at the office and I saw they have Midday Rush Menu items from 11am to 3pm Mon to Friday, and I have to say they have a nice variety to pick from. 

I went with the Bollo Pasta; it was a bowl of pasta, crazy right??  It was angel hair pasta cooked perfectly paried with a spicy marinara sauce, and it came with a slice of garlic bread.  It was a perfectly delish lunch, guess I now have Oregano's to add to my lunch time list!"}
{"text":"Its Prom night and my son and his boyfriend invited me out to dinner with them, they picked Oreganos, I felt a little under dressed sitting with them, they looked very sharp in their tuxes, and me, just jeans and shirt haha.

I ordered the unlimited bowl of pasta which was angel hair pasta, which is my favorite type of pasta, with  a spicy marina sauce and I had mine covered with freshly grated parmesan cheese, made it look like to snowed! It was so good, I wound up having 2 bowls of that stuff! WOW! 

The style of the restaurant is cute, it makes you feel like you're at your uncle or aunts house that's borderline hoarder with all the lil knickknacks and random item of things on the walls & shelves, gives your eyes plenty to see for sure! The manager came by the table and told the boys they looked sharp! The servers shirts, oh aren't they cute in a tongue & cheek sort of way, I loved it, 

Food was good, service was great, our server was Katherine, she was a great gal, making sure the boys had plenty to drink and that we had everything we needed. This is a nice lil neighborhood place to eat!"}
{"text":"I do NOT like this place.  I think it is way too salty...especially the sausage.  The pizza is just so so to me.  I will not return because for the money, there are better places in the area."}
{"text":"I realize I'm one of the many 5 star reviews, but my experience was with their takeout service. Couldn't have been more friendly. The food was as good as ever and it was ready right on time. Love oreganos and the people that work there."}
{"text":"Consistently long wait times although there are often a number of tables available, as well as poor service. We live close by and will not be going back."}
{"text":"You can often find me here with a friend or client, I love this restaurant! Great value, great pizza and great salads! Heck, I just show up to get a great big glass of their Passion Iced Tea! My favorite meal is probably the Vino Bambino salad.....great variety of ingredients! Keep up the good work Oreganos Shea!"}
{"text":"If you want yummy pizza, this is the place to come.  We live nearby, so this is always our first choice of pizza place to go.  It's always busy, so plan on a w ait of some kind.  If you go at a normal eating time ie. 6:00pm for dinner, expect a wait of 25-45 minutes.  They do have room for large parties too.  If we have our family get together, my husband and I will go early to get our name on the list to accommodate our 9 people. Staff is always friendly.  While you are waiting they bring samples of pizza around.  You can get drinks while waiting too.  Though their pizza is excellent, they also have great salads (the small is big enough for 2), and top notch vegetables.  Yes, if you haven't tried them, they have sauteed spinach, brussell sprouts and broccoli.  The vegetables are great!  Really, even better than most other restaurants where you would expect to find veggies. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the wait times are sooooo long sometimes.  It would be great if they could offer call ahead at least, so you don't have to wait long in the heat.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"So I ventured to give this location a second try after my first experience almost sent me to heaven in a pizza box! The service was great even the second time around! It took my boyfriend and I almost 20 minutes to order because we were trying to get something different that we both wanted to eat. Our waitress was so relaxed and willing to help, she finally took pity on us and suggested two dishes - which we jumped on.

The Big Rig Pasta was SO YUMMY! A+ for her first suggestion...though I wish I could say the same for her other suggestion. The stuffed mushrooms which was her second suggestion were \"eh.\" I'm not going to hold it against her though because she was just trying to help us. The mushrooms weren't that great, I think it had more to do with the sausage which the mushrooms were stuffed with and the overall texture of all the ingredients, just didn't do it for us. But I'd like to mention that even though these mushrooms were a bit gross, they were still 100% better than anything I ate at Avalon in Scottsdale. I'd rather eat stuffed mushrooms for the rest of my life then eat another dish at Avalon.

I am so bummbed though because even though I only took  a few bites of the mushrooms, I basically stuffed my face with the Big Rig dish and so at the end I was so full I couldn't eat their one dessert - which is what I wanted to order first but my boyfriend wouldn't let me until I had \"real food\" first. Ugh, next time dessert is #1 for this chic! :)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience! Our server Julian was very knowledgable about the menu and had great recommendations to offer. The atmosphere is unique and the food is delicious. Defiantly will come back"}
{"text":"Went a on Friday lunch!  Loved it!  It was a birthday lunch, so the waitress offered us free desert too.  NICE!!  I had the bowl of pasta with chicken for lunch..  TOO much food.  Good and fast!!"}
{"text":"I always love their pizza!  YUM!  Of course that is what I got.  But my friends said, we ordered some wings too.  Cool!  OMG, they are so good but since I am a wimp it was a little spicy for me.  

Yes, I know the decor is the usually Oregano's theme.  What give it the 5 stars?  The service!  Our server ROCKED!  She even offered to give us a togo cup of our drinks to take with us or get us fresh ones to take.  SWEET!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 20! We sat outside. Yes, it was HOT and we were sweaty. The server did he best to knowledge and make sure the group of us were taken of us. He did a fantastic job by himself. Waters were already on the table when we got there. He quickly got our drink and appetizer orders and then told us he is going to get our drink and appetizer orders in. He was quick with the drinks. 

The food took awhile. I know all 20 of us ordered different items, so the timing of when all the food is ready took awhile longer than usual. But is is serving 20 people all at 1 time. Like usual the food was tasty, good, and consistent. I tried the Zany Ziti with chicken. Yum and TON of food! 

Of course we had to order the half and half pzookie!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my nephew's birthday we had to wait about half an hour to get a table for 8.  Our server was awesome always checked on us and was super friendly. Our food all came out at once and it was all delicious.  We had pizza we had pasta we had a little everything."}
{"text":"The wait was CRAZY long for a table for 3 - quoted 1 hour and 15 mins.  After waiting for 25 mins, we saw an opening on the bar for 3 we took it and told them to remove us from the wait list.  The service at the bar was OK.  Too many thing happening for the staff.  I got the lime parm chcicken wings, the flavor on them were good and strong.  I ordered the chicken parm too.  It was just OK flavors just weren't there."}
{"text":"We were visiting a high school friend and his fam I hadn't seen in like,  years. Since we're both from the Chicagoland area, we decided to eat here...you know, for that \"Chi-Town\" themed good time.

  Arriving after lunchtime, we all sat at our reserved table and proceeded to order. Kudos to our server Gabriela who not only had to silently wait as we ordered but also had to deal with a child with autism issues. 

  We ordered fried zucchini for starters; good but nothing outer-worldly. The plate of gotchyo nachos was definitely a step up; as were the pasta with meatballs for the kids, bollo pasta w/o marinara, garlic cheese lasagna, and lastly the Clark St. 16\" medium pizza. For desert, we ordered the salted caramel pizza cookie  (delicious) and the cheesecake (not bad).

   I dug the Americana motif (even in the bathroom, which was clean and well maintained) and the liveliness, the friendly staff and yes, the military discount. It made reconnecting with an old high school bud that more special. 

    We don't live in the area, but we'd go out of our way to eat here again."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**

Absolutely delicious restaurant, five stars!! The entire menu is or can be made vegetarian friendly. It's a great mom and pop Italian restaurant. I had the The Bistro Classic Thin Crust Pizza and fell in love with the perfect garlic balance in the pizza. Everything smelled amazing, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

They have a private dinner party room and an outdoor patio. The decor of the restaurant added to the vibe/Italian feel. It was a great experience. 

Minus one star because we sat at the bar hoping for faster food service, but it took just as long or longer than a regular table. Regardless, will still return!!"}
{"text":"I ordered food to go last night and I was truly impressed by the girl that answered the phone to take my order. Rebecca was super friendly and informative. When I came to pick up my food I was greeted by Rebecca who had such a positive vibe and maintained a conversation with me while I was waiting for my food. If you are wanting to have delicious food and a wonderful experience I recommend going to this Oregano's and request to speak to Rebecca she will take excellent care of you!!!"}
{"text":"This is best restaurant I've been to in AZ! We are from California and come a few times a year, every time we are here we have to eat at Oreganos! Employees here are so friendly and the food is delicious!! Great atmosphere too! I recommend the Pablo Picasso salad and the deep dish pizza  but everything I've tried has not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I finally have time to write this review but it was about three weeks late :/. I came in with my friends around 3pm on a Saturday and put my name on the wait list. They said it would be about 30 minutes which was expected because it looked fairly busy. We were seated after about 20 minutes after the manager (or at least I think it was) asked a server if she could handle another table...which she responded \"of course!\" to even though she probably shouldn't have. My friend was on his 2 hour lunch break but we figured he had plenty of time. The server came over after about 10 minutes to get our drink, but we understood because we are all servers currently and understand rushes. We had all of our orders ready by the time she came over because we were in a time crunch. The appetizers came after about 15 minutes which was awesome. We finished super quickly and waited...and waited.. and waited for our food. The server came after maybe 30 minutes to take our empty plates. We politely asked for the checks ahead of time since we were in a hurry and ordered our dessert knowing that we were running out of time. What worried us at that point was when we asked how much longer it would be, a scared look appeared on her face and she asked my friend what he ordered again. We check our phones and it had been an hour from when we first placed our orders. 

We would watch her walk past us and all of our drinks were empty... all of them... but she didn't seem to want to come over because she could sense how upset we were. Like I said, we are all servers so we know what it's like to either forget to put in an order or at least apologize and keep us updated on the status. We also all know that even though it was busy, it shouldn't have taken that long. A server came over with our dessert, before the pasta came out... but our server caught her before she got to our table and sent her back. Then the server came back to our table with the dessert and asked if we wanted to keep it at the table.... like really? We ordered the dessert 45 minutes after we ordered the pasta (mind you we all ordered pasta. No pizza.) and really don't want to watch our ice cream melting on top of our cookie while we drool over everyone else's food around us. The table in front of us was seated after us, ordered a pizza and finished and paid before we got our pasta. My friend ended up paying for his tab and returning to work without eating and we ended up packing it for him to go. I left early to reserve a spot and he arrived after we were seated so our whole experience took about 2 hours to finally get out.

My pasta was room temp at best. Only two of my friends dishes were warm. Thankfully she took the pazookies back and had them remade but she claimed she brought them out before the food because \"we seemed like we were in a hurry\" We were all starving so we just ate, paid and left. Still tipped 20% because maybe it wasn't her night. 

Sorry for the essay but I like detail. The service, cold food, and zero refills is one star. The fact that oreganos usually never disappoints me got another star. This was my first time at this location but I'll stick to the Glendale location."}
{"text":"I decided to take my yelp talents to Oregenos tonight for my 24th birthday, I am a famous yelper and have encountered many waitresses in my lifetime but let me tell you SARAH is the best waitress I've ever had . She sang happy birthday to me with such an angelic voice it could knock a bird out a tree. I will definitely be coming back and oregenos should make SARAH the CEO of the restaurant. Turn up"}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere, and service were amazing! Husband and I went on a rare day date from kids and were impressed with the portion sizes of the meals and the delightful exchanges with our server Brandon. Highly suggest his section as the growing number of customers seated with him did not diminish his attention to our needs. We will totally become regulars when time and money allow!"}
{"text":"If you love waiting 45 minutes for a table for horrible service and mediocre, overpriced Italian food, then this is the place for you.  The staff loves to keep people waiting for appearances, even when the restaurant is empty.  The last time we were there, we waited almost a half an hour for a patio table.  80% of the patio tables were empty and most of the staff was standing around with nothing to do.  The host finally came back to us after 20 minutes of waiting and said, \"You guys wanted a patio table right?\"  \"Yeah,\"  \"Ok, it'll just be a few more minutes,\" with no explanation.  We just got up and left and haven't been back since.

Don't bother.  There are too many other options in the area with better food and service, as well as shorter wait times."}
{"text":"We love this location of a Oregano's. This is already one of our favorite restaurants, but the location is great. The staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"We love the location of this Oregano's, but the staff is awful. The other locations are much nicer. Even the pizza seems to be worse here."}
{"text":"First I will say we LOVE Oreganos and actually eat there almost every week. This location is by far the closest to us and we will drive almost 20 minutes further just to eat at another location. 

The manager, BJ, is so unprofessional. He smells like a cigarette, shirt is untucked and lacks any understanding of how to properly handle food. He served us our Parmesan cheese one time and his hand was so low holding the spoon he was actually touching the cheese all over.

Poorly managed = poor service from the servers too. Eating at this location really does ruin our experience."}
{"text":"I heard about there Gluten Free pizza  
So I decided to try it. 
It's good but I like cold pizza the next day and
GF is NOT good the next day."}
{"text":"Ordered to go party platters and while I haven't picked it up yet, Jane the coordinator was really easy and great to work with. Email is best for her and we got my order figured out in less than 4 emails! I am sure the food will be fine but I'll edit my review if it isn't up to par."}
{"text":"Incredible food and great prices!  They know how to treat their customers."}
{"text":"Good food, pass on the staff attitude.  We ordered the Chicago stuffed pizza on Sunday evening.  The waiter pushed us to order an appetizer or salad and this was after we asked for suggestions on the 10 or 12 inches.  After suggesting what size he thought I could handle, even though there was two of us at the table, we went with the ten.  Apparently I can handle ten with no problem?  Not sure what he was referring to on the size, it seemed like a pointed comment with innuendo towards myself.  He told us it would be 40-45 minutes.  After a nice conversation, with my friend at the table, we asked on the time as it seemed like it had been at least 45 minutes.  When we asked the waiter then quoted I stated it would be up to an hour.  Hmm, 15 minute grace period?  My friend being a Taurus, fired at him to check on the status.  He then came out and told me it was almost ready.  He then brought it out and quoted the time it took 49 minutes.  Food was great, I learned a lesson in time and apparently sizes.  I'm hoping he was not a representation of the staff as I'll pass on that."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, what is otherwise good Pizza is marred by a terrible ordering and customer service experience. This institution frequently quotes 40 minutes for take out pizza and over the course of three visits the food has never been ready at that time. It is clear that they quote an early time for no good reason. I should not have to add a fifteen minute buffer window and risk my pizza being cold."}
{"text":"The food was good, the place is neat, the wait wasn't bad for a Saturday night and the service was good but the posting of the two no firearms signs at the entrance bothers me. The fact that they would deny their customers the right to defend their families if need be to satisfy someones feeling of imaginary saftey is ridiculous and because of that they gets 2 stars and I will not go back."}
{"text":"Pizza is a little heavy on the cheese, but good overall. Great service and huge salads."}
{"text":"Oreganos is our favorite spot for date nights, girls night, anything! The food is delicious and we love the atmosphere. We have always had great customer service. I recommend the \"Alfredo the dark\" which is spicier than a normal alfredo pasta but so delicious! For dessert try one of their pizza cookies! You can't be disappointed with either of those! Also, heads up that their portions are big so you can share between 2 people or have yummy leftovers!"}
{"text":"never been a fan of this place. my wife and my inlaws absolutely love this place.. the pizza is flavorless and leaves ya needing a gallon of water afterwards. im from chicago and have yet to find decent pizza here in az.   i tried their lasagna the next time cause ya really cant mess that up... wrong. also flavorless and overcooked to boot. i have quit going with them and just fend for myself at the house. on the upside...the pazooki is fantastic."}
{"text":"I love this pizza!! Really good, can be packed so call ahead or take your chances. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"*EDIT* I am updating my review. I would like to thank the manager for reaching out to me about the issue. I appreciate the follow up. The food is great and the service staff is friendly. 

We love coming here but I was very disappointed with the experience today. I tried for the last 20 mins to join the waitlist but the app keeps giving me an error message when I click join waitlist. I called and let them know of the issue but was told there's nothing they can do to help since their policy is to not take names over the phone. My app is up to date and we were less than 5 miles away. Fix your waitlist app issue please!"}
{"text":"Normally, I love Oregano's however unfortunately this location failed us this past weekend. We went on a Saturday and had a party of 8 - the wait was about 90 minutes which was fine, we expected that for a Saturday evening. When we were seated, we ordered pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it took 1.5 hours to get our food - we did not order any of their deep dish, so we have no idea why it took that long. Our waiter kept telling us that our food would be out 'any minute'. By the time the food came out, which was pizza other than my order of pasta, my pasta was ice cold and didn't include any chicken which I specifically ordered. At that point I asked the waiter to just remove it from the bill and luckily my friends shared their pizza with me. I definitely cut some slack for busier nights, but this was just too much gone wrong."}
{"text":"My very first visit to AZ Ayesha took me to Oreganos for some pizza and a beer after we hiked up and down a Mountain. It seemed like a good way to reward ourselves for the hard work.  As I prepared to return for a quick valentimes whistle stop return, my one request was to sit outside again in the warmth of the desert and drink a beer at Oreganos.

I didn't quite get my wish, as we decided on dinner rather than lunch, and at that point it was even too cold to sit outside for this Michigander.  But all that melted away as we ordered the Picasso.  A finer, tastier deep dish pizza you will never have.  Not Chicago, not anywhere. Yes it takes 45 minutes, but we were surrounded with fantastic company and drinking delicious beers, so the wait flew by.

So while I normally eschew the chains, I make a large exception for this local AZ wonder.  Can't wait to return Oreganos - next time we dine al fresco."}
{"text":"Ok on one week business trip I made it out here 3 times.  The best place wings the golden BBQ are amazing.  All the food coming out was huge.  I had thin slices and deep pizza and would say their thin is much better.  Also had their chicken sandwich was good.  I will be back for the wings every time though!"}
{"text":"I was super excited that this opened right here next to our office plaza So disappointed at service and the quality of food.... This is what I get in my salad.... if you look close at the pic some of this lettuce has black edges ... ugggg .. and I gave them a second chance. No more chances for this place...... horrible service and food. I would of never thought it could be possible at an oreganos !!!"}
{"text":"I would give this Oreganos location 5 stars if it was not for the putrid raw sewage odor which is always present at this restaurant. The sewage smell is most apparent when you are waiting outside in the waiting area. I have been to this location 3 times and each time the sewage smell was present. Sometimes you can even smell it inside the restaurant while you are dining! 

I asked a waitress last night what the smell was from and she said that the sewage from all of the restaurants in the area collect to a location under the manhole near their front door. Apparently, they tried to fix the problem, but have been obviously unsuccessful.

I love the food and atmosphere at Oreganos, but I will not return to the Glendale location until they get their sewage odor problem fixed."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come visit Arizona again so I can get the El Diablo dish!! Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to visit Oreganos on the recommendation of a friend. We were very impressed. The stuffed mushrooms were fantastic!  We then had the thin crust with spinach and broccoli.  Again was very impressed. You have to try the pizza cookie for dessert. You will not be disappointed!  Thank you to Joseph our waiter as well for the service."}
{"text":"No wait for a Friday lunch. Triple sausage thin crust with a side of parm cheese. Delicious! Nice new location. Great service at the bar."}
{"text":"Aris, the manager, is outstanding.  Knowing we would be coming with a large party, I called earlier in the week to see if we could make a reservation to be placed on the patio.  They don't take reservations, but were willing to place us on the wait list for a certain time and I just need to make sure I got there early to check in.  Aris called me, on his day off, to verify that were still coming and to let us know that he wouldn't be there, but had already talked to the people at the host station, about the arrangements, and we would be taken care of.  Certainly, above and beyond what he needed to do.  Our wait staff was very attentive and were great when we needed to have food come out earlier for the kids.  I've never been a huge fan of Oregano's food (just personal taste), but their customer service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Love the food -- terrific thin crust pizza, Italian Gold wings (honey mustard BBQ), and great beer choices.  Very kid-friendly; kids menu is good, and they bring them dough balls to play with.  The Pizookie (a giant mostly-baked cookie topped with 3 scoops of ice cream) is inventive and a great way to share a dessery.  Servers are usually fun and attentive.  The only thing that stops us from going more often is that it's too damn crowded.  30 -60 minute waits are not uncommon."}
{"text":"Other than the long wait this place bis awesome.  Always good salad, pizza and pasta.  Make sure to follow it up with a pizzoookie."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites places to chow down in Arizona. It's an oasis of refreshing Italian food with hearty portions that won't break the bank - although they may break your belt! Most everything on the menu is extremely palatable from the salads to the sandwiches...but they do some mean pasta and pizzas. I'm a huge fan of the Big Rig pasta. And of course, they are known for their melt in your mouth dessert, the pizza cookie (aka pizzookie). Save room for this bad boy, because no Oregano's meal is complete without it.

The ambiance is really casual but fun, and the staff is really friendly. My fav location is the one in Tempe. It really is a place with \"Menu can trust.\""}
{"text":"I am in love with this pizza. I love the crust! I can't eat cheese or meat so I ordered a veggie pizza without the cheese and it was heavenly! I wish there was one closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Yummm. Love The Lady is A Scampi.. it's all I ever seem to order from this place. Can't get myself to stray. HUGE shrimp, pasta i perfect and full of flavor. As for everything else.. service was spot on, wait was only 30 minutes on a Friday night which is unheard of. One complaint.. ordered a dirty martini and there was no olive garnish :( But if that's the only problem..we're in pretty good shape."}
{"text":"Okay here it goes..while their food remains consistently delicious.. their service leaves a LOT to be desired. This issue is with the bartenders. A group of us showed  up for a birthday dinner. The regular wait was an hour.. for us (party of 11) was 1 1/2. My friend Carlos and I walked  up to the outside bar and no bartender to be found.. ok? No problem..inside we went. Okay so we approach the inside bar. We stand there and are unnoticed  by the 3 people behind the bar. Finally a woman greets us..imagine Janis Joplin and Joan Jett having a love child and now she's in her 40's..She takes my order a single Amstel Light...she takes Carlos' order.. 2 drinks. She cards us.. I show her my id and he shows his. She explains she needs to see and card the person he is buying the drink for. Okay that's a pain.. but fine. So what does she do. She leaves me at the bar while she goes with Carlos out to the crowded patio to card his wife.. really? How about you take care of me since I have met all the requirements? okay? so while she is gone..another bartender comes up and takes my order. As he is about to grab me a beer Janice Jett returns and says something to him he looks at me and I say the beer is for me Im on my own tab he turns back and he walks away?? WTF? What does it take to get a friggin' beer. So Janice Jett gives Carlos 2 drinks then I finally get mine and what does she do? She puts it all on Carlos' tab? Are you freakin kidding me? Janice Jett you are the WORST bartender ever. You did nothing right in this transaction. Needless to say we ended up with her as our server.. Murphy's Law..and she tried to card me again! I clued her in that she had done it just 20 minutes ago and her memory kicked in. Then we ask for more drinks. Half the table received theirs..and she made the rest of us wait as she doled out waters. Waters are great but we ordered beer..give us what we ordered! THEN give us waters..Ive never been so frustrated or irritated. It was almost laughable. Needless to say I didnt bother to order any more drinks after that.. what's the point..I wouldnt get it in a timely fashion anyway."}
{"text":"Cheese bread was on point! The Chicago stuff pizza was pretty good, just took over 50 min to come out. Friendly staff and didn't have to wait too long for a table. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"The pizza is delish to bad both times we have Been here we have Had bad experiences 1st time the waitress dropped our debit card in the trash waited for about 30min for her to find it... 2nd time ordered the número oneo with jalapeños stuffed .. All we got was a stuffed cheese pizza with jalapeños this pizza takes about an hour to make so just ate what we got manager fixed our check but still waited so long for an incomplete pizza wasn't cool :/ probably won't be back ... Might just take our chances at another pizzeria"}
{"text":"This is THE best restaurant I have ever been!!  I would buy a ticket out to Arizona JUST so I can go there.  Their cheesy garlic bread with marinara is amazing...their pesto bruschetta is unreal...I'm salivating just thinking of their Italian Gold wings (does ANYONE have the recipe to that sauce?)...the Big Rig with chicken is phenomenal (my favorite pasta dish ever).  And of course, you can't forget the pizzookie...I'm drooling just thinking of their menu.  

For salads, their Caesar with chicken is great (they shave their chicken and season it in some kind of cajun spice) as well as the Pablo Picasso.  

Ugh.  I think I may have to buy a ticket for later this month, just so I can eat there again soon.  

The service is outstanding...every single worker smiles and greets you as they walk by you.  

TRY THIS PLACE!  There's no better place in the WORLD!  Now if only they'd branch out to Chicago..."}
{"text":"While the food was good and the service ok, was very disappointed with the Yelp waitlist service.  Got on the waitlist right before we left home, and the service told us 10-14 minutes.  Got there right on time and was told by the hostess that the Yelp waitlist app is VERY inaccurate and would be at least another 20-30 minutes.  Waited over 45 minutes before getting a table, had two small kids with us and they were starving by the time we got our food.  If they know it's inaccurate why bother?  Next time we won't bother."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had lunch at Oregano's recently and I can honestly say that I had a great experience.  Although I had been there once before, this was the first time I had eaten inside due to the heat.  After a few minutes inside we felt it was rather chilly inside so I went to my car to grab a jacket for my girlfriend to wear.  After coming back in and sitting down, Mike, whom I believe was the manager on duty that day approached us to let us know he had adjusted the a/c so it wouldn't be so cold inside.  

Not only was our food great, but thanks to our server and especially Mike for being so thoughtful and kind, our overall experience at Oregano's was absolutely amazing.

It's the little things in life that count and I appreciate good customer service when I see it.  Thank you, Mike and your staff for the great food and great customer service experience!  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place was the worst Oreganos I have ever been to! I went there today at 2:18PM with my family to celebrate my sons 11th birthday and they didn't even acknowledge me or my family for 10 minutes. There was an older Caucasian lady that came after us and she was imediately taken care of, which made us feel discriminated for being a minority.

We decided to leave and call to complain to a manager. After waiting a total of 10 minutes and calling twice, finally a manager named John answered the phone. I told him what happened and he apologized about the service that they provided. 

We ended up going to the Barrio Queen that was down the street and we were seated right away and our server and food was amazing.

They are once more the worst Oreganos I ever been and I will never go there ever again. So disappointed to have been treated that way at one of our favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here tonight, we arrived around 5pm and were seated right away. When we left a little before 6:30pm, there was quite a long wait to sit. You can't go wrong here if you want a lot of food for cheap, good pizza & great service. Between 4 adults we split 2 big salads, a pasta dish & a 12\" deep dish pizza and we had tons of leftovers. The kids meals are a large portion as well and so inexpensive, my son had penne marinara, broccoli & milk for less than $5. We ended our meal with a pizza cookie which I highly suggest as well. If you sign up for their email club on their website you get a free pizza cookie, so we did so before we arrived. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices. Good service. 

The lunch bowl-o-pasta is 5.99 and an all you can eat pasta bowl. It's really tasty and for a few extra dollars you can get awesome meatballs or sausage....or one of each. 

We also really like the Pablo Picasso salad. The salads are absolutely enormous (they call their small size \"big\") and can easily be an appetizer for 4 people. 

Overall this place is just quick, easy, affordable and consistently delicious."}
{"text":"First off I have to preface this with the fact that I just love Oregano's! Their food is the bomb and I have yet to find something on the menu that I don't like. Thursday we went for a coworker's birthday lunch and no one was disappointed. There was a big group of 12 of us and we were seated right away. Our waiter came right over to take our drink orders and was very friendly. I had the Pablo Picasso salad. And for anybody that has ever eaten here you know how huge their salads are! I always ask for the dressing on the side because I can't ever finish the whole thing. It has just the right amount of spice mixed in with the chicken, tomatoes, cheese, tortilla strips, and whatever else is mixed in with it. And they do not skimp at all on all the good stuff. Our entire table was pleased with their meals and our server was fabulous keeping all of our drinks refilled and bringing out a couple of cookie pizzas at the end for our birthday folks. Their lunch specials are great and the \"heckuva\" slice you can get for under three dollars is a great bargain. Pair it with a side salad and you have a filling lunch that won't break the bank. It is one of our most requested lunch places for birthdays at our work because everyone is sure to get something they love."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of girlfriends for dinner the other day. My husband and I have also been here a couple times before too. I'm always impressed with the service. All our orders come right and the wait staff is always so attentive. The salads are huge!! The pizza was great! My favorite is the guacamole dip!!! So amazing. The food is always large portions and always so tasty!! One of my favorite things to do is order the enormous appetizers and have drinks at the bar, then order dessert afterwards! The only thing I wish for is more healthy food options! But other than that, we are so glad we finally have an oreganos on the Westside of town"}
{"text":"Me and my husband eat here minimum of 3 times a month, if not dine in then to go. We have tried many different pastas and pizzas. Their pizza is made to the perfect crisp with just the right amount of marinara, which is incredible! Besides the pizza we'd have to say the best thing their menu is their big rig. It's to die for!!! A little bit of spice and a ton of flavor! With all this good food only comes even better service. We've had a few of their waiters/waitresses and they're all incredible! Especially Katie! We love this place and especially this location!"}
{"text":"Omgggg pesto penne baked pasta is a must try! My favorite pasta on the menu by far. Good pizza, decent beers on tap. 

This specific location the staff is super friendly. Very attentive."}
{"text":"4 pm on a Saturday and the wait is already 1 hour for 2 people!!! Waiting area is super tiny so there is no room to wait unless you want to sit in your car when the temp outside is 50 degrees and very windy!!!! Parking lot is difficult to maneuver due to construction next door. Very poor planning all around!!!! Won't probably go back, the parking lot is always full of cars so I assume the wait is long no matter when you go."}
{"text":"impressive!  this guy Connor working at the bar is running his ass off!  more than impressed at how well he is handling this busy night. and it s a Sunday!  artichoke lasagna was amazing. drinks are good.  just all around impressed and will def come back.  make sure you come on this guys shift."}
{"text":"I live in tempe/s phx area but derive to this location anytime I want oreganos. I've berm coming here for years and LOVE the food and service. The polka e is always packed. I didn't care to wait bcz I know it's worth a great meal and time.  
I tried a few things here, can't even remember all of them.  Honestly all have been delicious so far. 
The girl that served us yesterday was great. She was very sweet,  attentive. Checked out table the whole time for refills,  empty plates, to go boxes. I was stuffed but she got me to try the cheese cake. Loved it ,too. 
The manager chef Neff on our table a couple times,  asked annot the service. Turns out our waitress is very new but she was awesome!
Another mgr was walking around checking everything. Mex bald guy,  very attentive as well. Couldn't go another visit without giving g this place credit. Waited to long to do this."}
{"text":"The service here was horrible our server would take 20 minute increments to check on us!"}
{"text":"Oregano's has been a favorite restaurant with our family since before we WERE a family (circa 1998). Even though we've never lived close to any of the locations, we've had so many great moments (and honestly, in 13 years, only ONE bad experience) at this local chain. We had our first date on University in Tempe and we had our wedding celebration party (after eloping to Australia) at the Scottsdale location. The front patio at the Mesa restaurant was the choice for my husband's 40th birthday party.

 Always great service! Great atmosphere (friendly, fun) and great food.
Our two boys now love to come with us to the newest location (near our home in Ahwatukee--thank heaven!) on Elliot Rd in Tempe which will surely be our new local hot spot, as it is near my husband's work as well. WE ARE SO EXCITED!

My favorite items on the menu (although I admit, I'm finally steering away from my usuals so that I can try the rest of their extensive menu):

Kick BUTT Garlic Bread (be sure to order it with cheese and a side of marinara)--YUM!
Guaca Tony (I only recently tried this and am sorry that I've been missing out all these years)

Chicken Ceasar Salad (dressing is SO good, and there's never too much of it) 

The Sproccoli Deep Dish or Stuffed Pizza - have a little salad, which comes out quick; then wait another 20 minutes or so for the Chicago-style pie--SO worth the wait! (and so filling, you'll have leftovers for lunch the next day!)"}
{"text":"Awesome place, LOVE it!!!! Foods great, people are great... crave the Big Rig on a regular basis!!!"}
{"text":"Another good dining experience.  Dianne was our server and did not disappoint.  We went in the middle of lunch (I don't know why) around 12:15, and despite 100 degree temp we sat on the patio at the bar.  It was warm, but the shade and misters helped.

We shared a \"slice,\" which is 2 pieces, and some wings.  We usually prefer the wing of the wings over the drums, but did not have that option.  The wings were fantastic!  The medium sauce was the perfect heat.  We washed this down with a couple of cold beers and left again with a smile.

Thank you Oregano's."}
{"text":"Called in an order on free cookie night about 45 minutes from closing. You could barely tell that the staff had been through hell thanks to this. Eat here at least 3-4 times a month and everything is great. The empolyee's are awesome as well!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for consistency, this is the place to really be constantly disappointed, after a couple times asking for extra sauce and charging me as well, I never seem to get any...EVER."}
{"text":"If you know me you know that I don't usually write bad reviews, I try to keep it positive and help suggest great places to eat versus some who seem to get their kicks from ripping some places reputation to shreds.  But in this case I had to put this out.  We had lunch there and the food was okay, but not as it had been in the past.  The server was very good but it took a little while for the food to come to the table.  While it was lunch, I noticed that they were not as busy as they usually are.  I had the stuffed pizza and my friend had a few big slices.  The food was served hot and was acceptable, however, several hours later we were both not feeling well.  I'll spare you the gross details but lets just say, it was to much of a coincidence to not believe it was something we ate.  I think Oregano's is generally a great place and have had some good experiences there in the past, but currently there is something going on there ... I'll stay away for a little while until they get it all sorted out.  Please let me know if your experience is different, would love to give them another try in the future. Sorry Oregano's, you made one of very rare 'bad' posts list.  :-("}
{"text":"I used to come to Oreganos all the time for their wedding soup. I havent been to Oreganos in over a year but did they change the formula?

The bread bowl is new but the taste of the soup was not so good. It was like a 9 before but I would rate it like a 4 now. 

The soup broth was much thicker than it used to be. Almost more slimely like a mucus rather than the watery broth it used to be. I also do not remember the big chunks of carrots and celery in it. 

Finally, the soup I swore had small meatballs in it, in addition to the large one, but this one lacked those. 

The soup was the reason i would always come here. I dont know if this is a fluke or if Oreganos changed the formula somewhere down the line. I would really like to know because if they did it was a poor decision. 

There was a line to get our table but I dont mind waiting. The server was also very nice and kept our drinks filled. 

I may try it once more to see if this soup is the same at another location or ask someone if they know if it changed. Our server wasnt sure if the soup was different. 

Such a shame I been going to oreganos over 10 years."}
{"text":"Finally got in to eat at Oregano's in Surprise. When the snowbirds were here the wait time was too much for me.  On the Saturday night we went, it was a fifteen minute wait to sit on the patio so we took it.  It was pleasant.  The waitress was nice and kept our drinks filled.  The wait time for our food wasn't as long as I expected considering we got pizza.  It tasted great.  My MIL got the sausage sandwich and it got glowing reviews. My son ordered the spaghetti and ate every bite.  We will be back.  As long as the snowbirds stay north, we will enjoy this delightful Italian eatery."}
{"text":"First time eating here. We came with our daughter and her friend for a b-day dinner. Portions are very large and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"In my absence on Yelp for a couple months, I went traveling. So here is Oregano's Pizza Bistro. It's one of quite a few in Arizona, and I very honestly wish I could take it back to California with me.

The portions here are huuuge. Actually, probably huge for a person like me, but pretty normal when you think about restaurant portions. The water glasses here are like a third larger than regular water glasses!

The Boom Dip: Really delicious piping hot spinach and artichoke dip, served with \"Italian chips\". This is definitely something to share with your friends! The Italian chips were HUGE and crisp on the outside but soft enough on the inside. It made a great pair.

Bistro Sweet Po's: I have a soft spot in my heart for sweet potato fries. I will try them anywhere! Oregano's served them with a sprinkling of cinnamon and a tangy aioli. A good sweet and salty combination.

My first time at Oregano's, I got the Big Rig Pasta. That thing was huge! But also delicious. The cream sauce paired well with the fresh diced tomatoes and I loved the spice. My second time, I got the Alfredo The Dark. It took my favorite sauce and added a twist - this shit is spicy, dude. Spicy seems to be something they favor here as a few pasta items on their menu have spice. If you get the Bollo Pasta, they say it's \"spicy\", but it isn't really. The sauce is very different than your run of the mill marinara though, in a good way. I would recommend it if you're going for something simple for lunch.

Others might find the decor and environment very kitschy - commercials from decades past play on the televisions inside, the menu covers are old album covers, and everything is styled to be very retro. The backs of the staff t-shirts will make you laugh. I find it all amusing. What I didn't find amusing was how long it took for food to come out - they were always busy when we went. Other than that though, my experience with Oregano's was very pleasant."}
{"text":"This location is pretty great! The worst part is the wait, which in my personal experience can be about an hour and a half. Once you're in the door though, the wait proves to be worth it. The entire staff is super friendly and sociable. 

The food is spectacular - worthy of five stars, and everything on the menu that I've tried to date (which is most of it) has been perfectly prepared.

This is a great place for a date or an outing with friends, and has my highest recommendation. Just be ready to wait to get in, though."}
{"text":"I like so many things on the menu it takes forever to decide what to order. You have to keep in mind that you have to save room for the pzookie. This is a must! Pzookie is a huge chocolate chip cookie in a cast iron dish served warm with ice cream on it. UM Yeah, its freakin delicious. Anyway the beefstro salad is awesome. Normally i don't care for steak in a salad but this is very thinly sliced rib eye and its so good, and big enough for 2-3 to share. The wings are really good and they are all drum stick wings and three kinds of sauces. The original is best. The Italian wedding soup with a meat ball is so tasty. The Big Ravioli is really good and stuffed with lots or cheese meat and topped with marinara sauce. But the Chicago Style deep dish pizza is awesome. Its huge very filling so don't order unless your with a group of people. It takes about 30 minutes to make but its so worth it. Just remember to save room for the pzookie. Even if you are stuffed order the pzookie cause when you see it and try it you will finish it!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never written a review of Oregano's!

Absolutely love their stuffed pizza! It's the closest thing to Chicago-style pizza in the valley. Sausage, Pepperoni, Mushroom and Onion is a must-try favorite of mine"}
{"text":"Oregano's is another restaurant to add to my regular rotation. Love, love their pizza along with most of their other menu choices.

Today we went for lunch. I had their version of an Italian Grinder with waffle fries and a side of the gardiniera. The bread was toasted perfectly, the fries nice and crispy. I went with the jr. size sandwich and was glad I did, it was the perfect lunch size serving.

My partner decided on the all-you-can-eat lunch pasta special with the addition of meatballs. 

To their credit the soft drinks and water come in HUGE glasses. I love it when a restaurant gives me a big glass of ice water with my meal. Saves them from refilling it every 5 minutes when it's a small glass.

Our server, June, was great and originally from Chicago!

If you are one of the few people that haven't tried Oregano's...do it TODAY!"}
{"text":"Maybe we ordered easy to prepare food items, but our food came faster at this location than it has at any other Oregano's location.  They have a small bar on the patio outside that is always a good option when the one inside is full.  My hubby and I shared the calamari (love the marinara sauce on the side) and the large Pablo Picasso Mexico salad.  Do yourself a favor and add extra sautéed onions on top.  It adds that little extra crunch and flavor.  It is by far big enough for two to share."}
{"text":"I know by personal experience that the low rating for this place overall is most likely due to slow service.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table, which is par for the course on a Friday evening.  It was nice that they had a server outside serving drinks to all who were waiting on tables.  Once we were seated, the golden wings we ordered took well over 25 minutes to get to our table.  That is a really long wait for an appetizer, especially when we saw the people next to us order and receive their food before we received the wings.  Our entrees took at least 15 minutes after we had already finished the wings.  As always, the food was fantastic.  You can't go wrong with the Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad.  If the service time can be improved somehow, this is a 5 star place for sure."}
{"text":"Best BBQ chicken pizza around.  The Bollo Pasta with Alfredo is great too.  Love eating here and always happy with the food and service."}
{"text":"This place is totally adorable. It's got that old-timey-nostalgia-Italian feel like a Buca di Beppo's does, but x100. The seating is a little more casual though than a Buca. My mom absolutely loves their salads, and she forewarned me about their gigantic size. She wasn't kidding! 

Upon receiving said gigantic salads, I looked around and noticed everything is huge - drink cups, salads, & pizzas. All is fair though, I was ridiculously hungry and though the Picasso Mexico Salad would suffice. Did. It. Ever - and some! Although I asked for dressing on the side, I was happy it was mixed in due to the salad's size. 

Our server was funny, maybe a little too goofy. But good all in all. Cannot wait to return to try some of their pizza that my Phoenix family enjoys!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for almost an hour for lunch.  People who came in after us have gotten their food.  Unacceptable.  Ready to walk out.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We thought the 3rd time would be the charm but we were  wrong . My favorite salad at the other Oreganos , the Pablo Picasso came with hardly any meat and almost no dressing,  it was  completely blah. The service is slow and the food  isn't up to par so we will drive to the Goodyear location."}
{"text":"Wife and I went there for a date.  Never went there before and decided to give it a try.  It was about a 35 minutes wait (Saturday, around 7:30 pm).  It was loud, and the music very loud.  We don't care for noisy places.  The food was great, better than we expected.  Ravioli fried and stuffed with pepper jack cheese.  My wife got some stuffed mushroom, and loved them.  We ordered a stuffed pizza with cheese, spinach, and broccoli.  It took 45 minutes to cook, but it was amazing.  The portions are big, so we took a lot home.  Very good. It was noisy, which was only thing we didn't like."}
{"text":"Good pizza and huge portions for the price.  Enjoyable food and fun atmosphere.  Had a huge slice of pepperoni pizza that filled me up!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good. Portions are huge and no matter what time you go there is always a line out the door. Good for business but not when you don't have 2 hours to dedicate to eating out. I will go back though and recommend it if you have the time."}
{"text":"Food was good. I ordered the bowl o- pasta with rigatoni noodles meat sauce and chicken... no garnishments. 
Pasta Basta was ordered by my lady, this is her go to here because of the ingredients...it's a must try!
Well Thanks for having us."}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza, love it better than their thin!  Their pastas are great and overwhelming in size.  They have a great tap selection of beer at the bar worth checking out, just wish they had some TVs for sports fanatics at the bar.  The staff at the bar is friendly and enjoyable to talk about.  Always long waits after 5:30 most nights so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"4 stars. I love Oreganos! 

Positives:
If we are comparing apples to apples here (which is how I like to rate) it beats any other Italian place I've been to, of the common chain type. Why not 5 stars? With that being said, I have had some mom and pop Italian places that are absolutely unbeatable. We do not go to Olive Garden as it is bland. Oreganos? Anything but bland! They pack in the flavor on every dish I have ever had. I cook with a lot of flavor and I also expect to get it when I eat out. I don't do blah.  I love the degree of flavor this place dishes out. 

I got the Riga Tony (yes that's how they spell it here) and added meatballs. The fact that I finished my entire huge plate is a good sign. Or a bad one depending on how you look at it lol.  Full of flavor. My mom got the scampi pasta dish which was wonderful but it def has a spicy kick to it! My sister got the thin crust pepperoni pizza which was good. And no.. They didn't forget the pepperoni it's under the cheese! Haha. We wanted to finish strong with the calories so we got a pazzuki (cookie pizza with ice cream. SOO good. They bring out the cookie hot and a tad underdone to perfection.  We had a great server.

Negatives: 
It does take quite some time for your food to arrive.. But I guess if you want fresh you gotta wait."}
{"text":"I gotta do 4 stars.  We have figured out to only do Oregano's when you see the wait is very small. Twice now we have been able to walk right in and sit down. This is NOT always the case! The wait can be ridiculously long on evenings.  We will pass when it comes to that.  So plan accordingly.

I have had several items off their menu: thick crust pan pizza, Stuffed Riga TONY (yes this is how it's spelled on their menu), salad, artichoke dip, thin crust pizza and of course the pizza cookie.  All of the listed dishes were packed with flavor, which is my kinda food.  (Like serious flavor going on) I add meatballs to my Stuffed Riga Tony and it's perfect. The thick pan pizza takes an hour.. yes you read that correct an hour to bake!!! But they do warn you ahead of time so don't get this if you're not in the mood for an appetizer and to visit.  

I always leave this place stuffed!  That's a good sign that the food is good and I eat too much.  If only if was as good physically for me haha.  No such luck.  This is a fun place to go if you're looking for some yummy Italian grub."}
{"text":"great first visit ! I know the wait time for a pizza is about 45 minute, but it is worth the wait. I had a really good caesar salad before my pizza came out. My friends had spaghetti and meatballs and they both said it was great. I will definitely come back. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a bit pricey"}
{"text":"I really like the food here.  Nothing really stands out all that much to me so I'm only giving them three stars.  I came here because it's my dad's favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  
It is really tiny and cramped inside so I would recommend outdoor seats.  The atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"I LOVE OREGANOS. If you are going to go, then you have to be sure to try my 2 favorite things on the menu. The chicken wings there are all good bit I usually get a honey mustard flavor. They are big and crispy and the sauce is awesome. 

For desert, get a pizza cookie. It's a large cookie that is cooked in an iron skillet so it's still pretty soft and it is topped with ice cream. Just make sure you have someone there to share with you because the portions are pretty big and the price is right."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite! Food and service was great. Even my very picky 7 year old loved this place. The kick butt garlic bread really does kick butt... Make sure to get it with cheese and marinara. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Loved it!! Excellent pastas and meatballs. Thin crust pizza. Sever Miguel was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Ate here today for the first time in years with my daughter while visiting ASU. The food was great as always, thin crust Chicago style square cut, great appetizer, etc. I don't really do Yelp reviews but thought it was key to point out how fantastic our waiter Sullivan was. It's so hard to find exceptional service these days, and he was as good of a server as I have encountered - even compared to the Ruth's Chris type restaurants of the world. He even brought us more soda in a to go cup when we were leaving - key when it's 108 degrees out. 

Will make a point of coming here every time we are in Tempe, props to Sullivan for taking a pizza lunch to a different level."}
{"text":"Waited 40 min for a salty commercialized thin pizza tasted like digiorno the only good thing was the huge garden salad it was fresh, our waiter wasn't very nice I felt like I was rush to order . I will not come back"}
{"text":"I haven't had a bad item on the menu- I will usually split a heck of a slice and some wings with maybe a salad but I've had the pasta and pizza, always delicious. This place is small and gets busy, if you try to show up past 12:00 fawghetaboutit... Decent outside seating but if its hot don't try, there are also a lot of flies in the outside patio area. if its early stop in, eat inside, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the name of our waitress was Jenny... as waiters ourselves she did a perfect job in everything. Everything we've every learned she did exactly that. Drinks, apps, desserts! She knew exactly what I wanted too! Lol mind reader! You can tell she enjoys what she does. We will definitely be coming back and be asking for her. She deserves some appreciation for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for some pizza with my family  and i was surprisingly happy with the outcome. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We came while on vacation and sat outside on the patio, it was a beautiful night and a beautiful setting. I had the shrimp Diablo pasta, and he had the pesto penne bake- both were incredible! The shrimp Diablo was creamy and spicy and wonderful- a large portion but not so large that it's impossible to eat. His pesto penne bake was cheesy and delicious, served in a bread bowl- his was also a really good size portion. The server we had was a new-bee, you could tell he was nervous, but he served our table of 6 quickly and without issue, I wish I had gotten his name so I could give him credit!"}
{"text":"Not Chicago style at all but good. Crust is way too thin! Gets super busy!!! Cheese and sauce are good. Takes a long time for a thin crust. Servers need some restaurant etiquette. I understand that it's probably their first job but if you train them well they will go a long way."}
{"text":"My friends and I go here often when we want to go out to dinner in a large group. The boisterous, friendly atmosphere is very good for groups. The food is also a decent price for the ENORMOUS portions you get - my salad lasted me seriously three days. Kind of a long wait sometimes, though. The pizzas are also good, as are the sandwiches! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. However, now that I've seen how much is in a salad, I'll probably go with that from now on... roughly $9 for a mountain of food that's gonna last me days?! Yes please.
Oh, and get the pizookie for dessert [if it's your birthday, you get one for free ;)]. Get half your meal to-go and save room for it. Trust me and you're welcome."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to eat at oreganos today! Very good. Ordered mexican salad, really large and a bit to spicy for my liking, but still good. My husband had parm hot sandwich,  it was very good. Good service,  the only thing I would say negative is there is no where to stand while you wait! Super akward to all be standing in small area by the front door. Maybe should have done a better job with space for people to wait."}
{"text":"So we have eaten here before and enjoyed the food but this last visit was exactly that, our last visit. I spent many years in food and beverage so I understand it can get hectic when busy. After an hour wait to be seated it took 20 minutes to get a food order in. The table next to us which came in 10 minutes after us starts getting food delivered..it's now almost an hour after we were seated and we have no food in front of us. The table next to us has their entire meal. After flagging some staff down they disappear and come back with one dish...it's barely above room temperature..the other dishes get dropped off also cooled down which means the food was ready just sitting somewhere for who knows how long. We are famished by now so we just ate the food. I was going to have the server feel how cool the food was but we don't see the server again until everyone is ready to go. No sorry about the wait or anything."}
{"text":"Order the big rig pasta this last week while eating out with my kids and mother. I took a few big bites before I crunched into what I thought was basil instead it was a black piece of plastic. I told wait staff but they couldn't tell me where it came from. They brought me a new bowl full about 3min later so  I'm assuming from the same batch I didn't touch it. They did take it off the bill but being 6 months pregnant I think I'm ruined from ever going back as the kitchen couldn't even name where the plastic was from."}
{"text":"Service great! Food great! Dessert great! GREAT!
Honey mustard wings, margarita pizza and pizza cookie my favs"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a problem at any of the Oregano's restaurants that I've visited in the valley...and I've visited almost all of them. Consistently good. Awesome Italian eatery, maybe my favorite."}
{"text":"We have always loved Oreganos, but my wife was recently diagnosed with a gluten allergy.  Many pizza places in the valley now have gluten free crust options.  Oreganos, please get with the times and add a gluten free crust option!!"}
{"text":"An incredible menu and experience. Great wines and awesome flavor in every dish.  The wings and pizza's were especially incredible.  It was a 45min wait even on a slow night, so plan ahead.  Customer service was awesome as well, even though we were on the back deck.  I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Love their gold wings and Alfredo the dark! The wait is always so long though! I recommend going do lunch during the week to avoid waiting an hour!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the two stars is strictly because the food was very delicious. Our order came out perfectly, even with all the modifications we had. The loss of three stars is due to the following...
Upon our arrival we told the server, Josh, that it was my birthday. I also ordered an alcoholic beverage and he saw my ID. He promised to embarrass me when the birthday dessert came out. Food arrived and we asked for more napkins and refills on beverages, which took almost 10 minutes to do. Parmesan cheese was not offered for our hot food like we had always experienced in previous visits. 
Now, let's talk about the end of our meal. Drinks are empty, nobody is touching their food, and our server is nowhere in sight. Then the bill comes to our party, no birthday dessert! He completely blew off my birthday! We paid the bill and sat around for about 15 minutes...no dessert. 
I asked the host as we left if they did anything for birthdays, and her response was \"yes, we do birthday pazookies\". Shocker, I let her know that our server completely \"forgot\" my birthday. We won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"This was a very enjoyable experience.  The staff is nice and attentive.  I had the stuffed rigatoni and it really was fabulous.  The menu is large so there is really something for everyone. It was a little loud in there but that is just part of their general ambiance.  I would definitely return to explore the menu further."}
{"text":"Love! Always amazing food and great service! Make sure you see Sullivan in the bar at the university location in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Every time we have been to this one the staff has been amazing. We always share a pizza and a pazooki and the food has never let us down. We have been to many of their locations and the superstition one is by far our favorite."}
{"text":"Oreganos is such a great place to have a family dinner. The food is not fast so you have time to talk and catch up. It you are hungry, order an app or salad. 

Their thin crust pizza is the best. Great apps, and salad and desert. Never have the deep dish - thin crust to too great to try something else. Great spaghetti. Really good, spicy sauce. 

Anyway. If you want fast order the pizza ahead of time. Otherwise enjoy the atmosphere and conversation."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom a few days ago to have lunch and it was a great experience! It was not too busy so we got a seat right away and our server, Sarah, was very friendly. She was eager to help us choose a meal and offered many different drink choices. It's great to get a server that is so genuine and happy. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was a bit apprehensive at first trying the stuffed pizza at Oregano's but it was actually pretty good. When you grow up eating pizza in Chicago you expect nothing but the best. The crust was buttery, sauce was okay, and there was a good amount of cheese.  The sausage was kind of a disappointment though, it was tasteless and just did not belong in that pizza. Overall, I would order from there again just minus the sausage."}
{"text":"Came to Oreganos for dinner while on business in th area.  I had high hopes as it was a Tuesday night and the place was packed.  I would look for other options....

We came in and had to wait about 20 minutes.  No issues as the time flew by.  The bar area was a bit cramped but had a quick drink before dinner.  We were seated quickly and our server was very friendly.   They were attentive but not over bearing which was great.   

They have a very extensive menu which is good and bad.  One of my friends had the pizza and it was pretty good.  I had the King Parmesan de Eggplant.  I am a huge fan of eggplant and was really disappointed.  The flavor was disappointing as it was pretty bland

Maybe I just got the wrong thing but I wouldn't come back here again.  There is too many good restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Pros:

Great service
AMAZING DESSERT (bazookie)

Cons:

Food was not great"}
{"text":"Been anxiously waiting for this new location to be opened since its nearby our home.  As expected, there was quite a wait on a Friday night. After some miscommunication from the hostess as to the wait, we were a bit frustrated. However our anticipation to experience the pizza kept us patient. Al, the manager sensed our initial frustration and was graciously able to get us seated at a booth way ahead of our wait time. He went way above and beyond the typical service given from high end restaurants. He personally checked on us and on our way out, thanked us by name for our patronage. Can't believe he remembered. Thanks Al. BTW, the thin crust pizza is awesome!"}
{"text":"I believe I have had a better experience at the Oregano's on Shea.  However this location is always popular, and you are guaranteed to wait a long time before getting seated so be aware of that in advance.  The customer service is friendly and definitely a family atmosphere just would like the food quality to be more at par!"}
{"text":"It was my first time to eat here and my experience was beyond good. I ordered their chicken parm and I liked the sauce but the chicken was kinda bland and overcooked but, overall everything was great. I loved their boom dip! It really blast in your palette. Well recommended!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the last two months. First visit featured very good food. But today I waited 12 minutes after sitting down, and in that time NO waitperson approached me. The table across from me came in 7 minutes later than I and had a waitress within 3 minutes. I waited for her to finish with those guests, thinking she would turn around and ask what I wanted to drink. Nope. So I left. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We love the food. We were celebrating my son's birthday. The cookie and ice cream dessert was fabulous. Very good service."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. 2 stars is from sitting next to bar and watching bar tender clean and sweep the bar area and then show her phone to other employees without cleaning her hands during the process. Lots of germs spread in that way. I'm sure the orange put in my beer was a great example."}
{"text":"Just had my first Chicago Pan. Im in love now...OMG what a fantastic pie. It is so worth it and the toppings were awesome...best pizza ever. I guess I will have to try the stuffed one now...it's been almost twenty years...time to man up! Love this place."}
{"text":"So, my family ate at this Oreganos last night and while we ate, someone broke into our truck by smashing out our window, and stole anything they could get their hands on.   When I talked to the restaurant manager, he said (and I quote) \"unfortunately, that type of thing happens here at this time of year.\"    I then went on to say that, as regular customers,  we were very disappointed because dinner also took us 2.5 hours(a very long wait with 2 kids...)!   Service was terrible and unbelievably slow.   The manager's response was (and I quote) \"yeah, I guess that is the down side of coming to Scottsdale's most popular restaurant.\"   Are you kidding?!    I reminded him that there are countless options in Scottsdale, and he'd just lost some loyal and frequent (year round) customers...  No apology whatsoever.   The manager of this restaurant couldn't care less that we were robbed and had a horrible dining experience.   Beware..."}
{"text":"Service was horrible .. 
hostess told us it would be a 35 minute wait, no problem, the woman and I decided to grab a couple drinks at the bar and we ended up just ordering food. Waited 45 minutes till we both realized that people that sat down after us are getting there food.. mentioned to the server about our food and she went to go \"check on it\", she came out with our wings & pasta, darn thing was sitting on the line for at least over 15 minutes. Chicken was ridiculously cold and so was the pasta with dried chicken strips. Horrible service. I was actually surprised she even brought it out to us, knowing that It was cold and had been sitting on the line for awhile. To sum it up we didn't even eat the cold/dry food. Cashed out and left. Sad thing was the restaurant was not at it's full capacity and service was horrible. Save your time go different pizza bistro."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Every meal I had at this place was tasty, perfectly cooked, and service is outstanding.

Highly recommend their pizza of course and the cheese bread.

I give this place 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Did take out order on Super Bowl Sunday. Front staff was very busy but stayed very positive and efficient. Told them I would hire all of them if I ever came out of retirement. Kitchen messed up my order, but Manager came out, explained it, and made it right. Love the Guac-A-Tony!!"}
{"text":"Sorry,   not much positive to say.   I was craving Alfredo.   What I got was undercooked boxed pasta with no taste.   I wondered where the sauce was and found it coating the soggy garlic bread stuffing into the bottom of the dish.  Would have loved the tasty garlic bread crisp and by itself rather than soaking up all the sauce and leaving the dish very unsatisfactory.  Also asked for their specialty drink \"up\"  -- it came with ice in a martini like glass -- although otherwise tasty.   Good service.   But will look elsewhere for my pasta fix."}
{"text":"Yum!!  We were looking for a place to eat and found this yummy pizza place!!  We had on line seating so it only took a few minutes for our table. The place was packed and rightfully so!! Good drinks:  the Painkiller and Bellini drinks were tasty. We had Numero 1-0 pizza and it was excellent. Thin crispy crust with tasty sausage. The fresh Parmesan our waiter, Giovanni, added just enhanced its tastiness!!
And we 4 shared a hot, homemade chocolate chip cookie with ice cream!! Stuffed and happy are we!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Oreganos for a couple of years now and I am always happy with my food! I've been getting the same order here ever since I can remember: A small Cesar salad, Aunt Margarita Pizza with extra marinara, and of course the wonderful pizza cookie.

I LOVE the dressing on the salad I usually always ask for extra because I can't get enough of it, and I have found that the Margarita pizza is a little on the dry side so I have recently started ordering it with extra marinara and its as good as ever.
But my absolute favorite part of the meal is the pizza cookie. They undercook it just right so its nice and doughy in the middle but crispy on the outside, topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate chips on top! Sometimes I just come in for the pizza cookie alone because its probably one of my favorite desserts!

The place is family owned and has expanded to several locations around the valley and I always get great service no matter what location I choose."}
{"text":"I tried to take the family here for dinner 3 times.  Each time, we were told the wait was 30+ minutes.  Since I hate waiting and they don't take reservations, we passed and went somewhere else.  On the 4th attempt, The Better Half went ahead of time to put our name on the list so that I could join them later when we got seated....it worked perfectly.  I was in a business meeting and she timed it perfectly so that I was able to make it right after my meeting.

We ordered:

Appetizers
Spinach Artichoke Dip

Sweet Potato Fries

Pizzas
10\" Thin Crust - Onions, Green Peppers, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheese

10\" Thick Crust - Anchovies, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheese, Onions
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=HOLWbqCsw7-cPBoyFTY19Q

Yeah....we were hungry!  We ordered too much food and had to take a lot of it home.

The Pizzas were cooked well done, per our request.  We enjoy well done Pizza.  Because the ingredients are fresh, it took 45 minutes for the Pizzas to come out.  I had the Thin Crust.  After such a long wait, I had high expectations....unfortunately, I was disappointed.  It was just OK.  The Crust didn't have much flavor and the ingredients, while fresh, didn't hit my taste buds on a positive note.....damn.

The rest of the family felt the same way about their Pizzas.  Kiddo had the Thick Crust Pepperoni & Sausage....he too is a Pizza lover like me and he said his was just OK.  Mom & The Better Half had the other Pizza and they too were underwhelmed.

The Appetizers were the highlight of the evening.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip was delish & the Sweet Potato Fries were awesome.

Overall, it was an average dining experience.  Was it worth the long wait to get in, then the long wait to get your Pizza?  No.

{"text":"Update: I previously had written a review on an unpleasant experience that I had on an incorrect charge. Ownership reached out to me and resolved the issue in a professional manner. Thank you for taking the time to reach out to me and help me with this!

Just had the worst experience at this restaurant. Read the menu and ask questions about the pizzas to see if there is extra charges before ordering. This was my first time there and I did not know that a specialty pizza was only thin crust, instead I ordered it with stuffed thinking that you can order any pizza with different crusts. I got charged an extra 17$ on top of the 16$ build your own pizza charge!!! Outrageous. The manager did not seem to care that I would not be coming back either."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here for dinner. Meals were good and reasonably priced. Hostess seated us right away. Waitress was very friendly and gave great service. But ( yes unfortunately there is a but), the problem was the flies. I guess it was from the outdoor bar & patio leading right into the dining area. They were surrounding our table and appeared to be a fan of our food as well. I'm not a fan of flies or any other rodent around me or my food while I'm trying to eat \"indoors\". But if this doesn't bother you. Than this restaurant is the place for you."}
{"text":"If you what quick service at lunch, go sit at the bar! Ask for Sully! He's awesome. He knows my food and drink choices. He's cute too! Don't forget the pazzoki!"}
{"text":"1st time eating here, got in with no wait. Love the atmosphere. Pizza was great, wanted the pan crust but the wait time for a pizza was 35-45. Crazy! Had their salad, huge portions! Not too bad. I am disappointed they don't do call ahead or reservations. Samantha was our waitress, she lacked smiles, not one smile from her. Not very friendly, which showed for her tip. It was lunch time so it wasn't crazy busy. Other staff were extremely polite, smiling, happy to be there it seemed."}
{"text":"Whenever we have a team lunch at work, this place is at the top of everyone's list.  We're really glad they moved down the street into a new location that's larger and can fit all of us.  At the old location, we were cramped inside and took up all of the seats.

Some of the menu items I've had:

Garlic Bread, $4.99
Toasted Ravioli, $6.99
Bruschetta, $7.39
Mini Stuffed Pizza, $6.79
18\" Thin Crust Numero Uno (Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushrooms, Onions, Green Peppers), $25.50

The Garlic Bread is evil.....it's very good and addicting.  I could eat it all day long.

The Toasted Ravioli and Bruschetta are good, not the best, but above average.  The Thin Crust Pizza is my fav though.  We order it \"well done\" so it comes out crispy and the Cheese has a slight burn on top.  They do it right here....soooo good!

I was convinced by a co-worker to try the Mini Stuffed Pizza one day....it was good, but I could only have 1 slice, it was too filling.

The servers here are great and easily handle the 25 of us and our quirkiness.

{"text":"I ordered a thin crust pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, extra sauce and extra cheese. They made it just as asked. But it didn't taste all that great. The crust wasn't as thin and crispy as we like it. The toppings just slide off the crust. The sauce didn't taste as Italian as I remember. Overall, it was what we asked for."}
{"text":"The Boom Dip was one of the best appetizers I've ever ordered. We had a thin crust pizza and stuffed rigatoni and both were delicious. Our server, Ian, was attentive and personable. 10/10, highly recommend if you enjoy good food."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've never left disappointed. My last visit was great. Our waiter was beyond fantastic. We had a good sized group and everyone's food was delish. I had my favorites: Guaca-Tony (one order was plenty enough for our group of 6), Big Rig Pasta with chicken (amazing flavor), and a Pizookie for dessert. I always feel i get my money's worth and have a great experience at this Oregano's location. I also have gotten take out several times and the food is still just as good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night while on our honeymoon and loved everything about this place! It's so cute and will decorated! The food is delicious with very generous portions! The big Caesar salad was more than a enough for us two and so yummy. My Alfredo of the dark pasta was scrumptious. The meat pizza had thin crust so you could taste every typing and it was a little spicy which we loved!"}
{"text":"\"You will be very happy in life.\" That's what my fortune cookie read- so I must have a positive review for Oregano's.  BTW is there a reason why they have fortune cookies there? This is the spot for the get together with a group of my friend's classmates. They get together at least twice a month and the place is always Oregano's.  For sentimental value it has turned into a tradition for them.  I was lucky to get invited to one of the get-togethers once and I'm somewhat inducted into the tradition. YAY! 

My favorites at Oregano's\"
Fell in love with this by accident because I wanted chicken so my friend ordered the BBQ Chicken- LOVES IT!!! 
The pizookie!!!! YUM! YUM! YUM!
The WINGS!!!! I have a friend who's adamant that Oregano's offered the best wings and here are his reasons:
1- Drummettes- no flat wings allowed  
2- Skinless
3- Crisp- I must admit it is crispy
4- Sauce- you can also ask for extra sauce and dip your pizza in it- delish!!
5- Value- I think you get 14.  Now, we are not sure if they charge for 14 or for 12 and you get 14. However, my friend likes to believe that it's more wings for your bucks.  Also, this is his argument- so he can believe whatever.
Last but not least, the service at the Tempe location has always been pleasant.  Our waitress there (I regret not getting her name) was superb and nice.  

Overall, this is a pleasant place for get togethers and have a good time with beer, wings, pizza and pizookie. Don't forget to pick up your fortune cookie on the way out. =)"}
{"text":"Love this place for its food and atmosphere. I love the music they play from the 1930's-1960's. Decor is retro and old black and white Classic movies play on old televisions. Love it. 

Getting in without a wait only happens mid afternoon, all other times you are just gonna have to wait, but the food is worth the wait.

My go to is not the expected Pizza. My favorite is the Turkey Stuffed oven baked sandwich and their seasoned waffle fries. The bowl of pasta is always a winner as well as the pizza, it's the bomb!

Nice weather and waiting for a friend, great place to be today."}
{"text":"Hello Chicago! In Gilbert, of course. Oreganos transports you back to old style Chicago in the middle of the desert. There are 40s era pictures on the walls, bookshelves decorated with jars of marina, and Hunts tomato sauce cans that serve as lights over the bar. The food is incredible, with fresh and authentic taste. The menu is diverse, with something for everyone! There are definitely a few southwestern influences to be found, such as being able to put green hatch chilies on your pizza. The portions are large, but you're going to want to take some home! The service is great, with friendly, eager staff. You'll definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"My family enjoys coming here,  so we come quite often.
I personally find the \"italian\" cuisine very distorted
Spicy and not authentic at all, I only come here when out voted.

The cookie pizza is very good"}
{"text":"Thank you for making our birthday celebration such a fun time. Dealing with the manager and all staff was a pleasure today."}
{"text":"Tonight we went to dinner at this location. It was myself, My daughter, my son-in-law, and eight children. Mike was our server and he did an extraordinary job!!  He made sure every detail was correct in our order, serving it with a smile.  Nicole was one the manager in charge and made sure we got seated quickly.  The food was hot. From the wings to the pasta.  And the cookie was very tasty.  Thanks for the great experience."}
{"text":"When the hotel manager recommended this pizza place I set my expectations low, preparing for desert quality cardboard flavored pizza. I was blown away to find legitimate Chicago style pizza! As in, all 3 kinds of Chicago pizza: thin crust pie with toppings under the cheese and sliced in squares, thick crust with piles of tomato, and even double crust (got 45 minutes to wait while it cooks?). Delicious! And a pretty decent selection of beers on tap. Just be prepared for a long wait, as the restaurant is ridiculously popular. Though it's not hard to see why!"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food.  The chicken caesar salad is  huge and could feed 3 people.  I highly recommend Oreganos!!"}
{"text":"If you want original, Amazing flavor, great tasting Italian food come to this place! I had the pleasure of dining at this establishment and not just get great service but so much food! The portions are huge and the options are plentiful. It was a group of 4 BIG guys who also are foodies too. We had 2 large Pizzas, 2 chicken shredded pastas, this crust appetizer with guacamole ,  salads and dessert (which is my fave!) and we were satisfied. 

Plus they have the best shits ( \" Its Ok to Cheat \" in bold letters with the fine print \"at your local pizzeria\" ... love it !)

I will me making my turnaround trips to AZ just to eat at Oregano's Pizza Bistro!"}
{"text":"There Gluten Free Pizza  is offal...the crust has no flavor and it is very dry. I do not recommend anyone to get the gluten free pizza."}
{"text":"I hope the food is better than the service. It's been 51 minutes and I finally got my drink. I was told 20-25 minutes before I would get a 4 top. Gave them until 30 before I courteously checked on my wait time. After another 10 minutes we arrived at our table where before I could sit down my hand fell into a puddle of what seemed to be a salsa or sauce. That sauce was also in a puddle on the floor at our feet. I stood and waited for a waitress to grab a rag but after 5 minutes of standing I went to the manager and asked if I could borrow her rag to take care of it myself. I don't mean to be rude but honestly I can take care of it myself if your staff is going to half a$$ it. Finally the manager went out and grabbed the mop and mopped the floor for us. Thank you manager. We then waited another 10 for our waters and my soda. Anyways, food better be good I'm sure it'll be another 45 minutes until we get that. Hope it's worth the service.


Update: food was pretty good. Didn't take too long. Lindsay helped try and turn the night around a bit so I appreciate that. Regardless I only adjust this review to a 3 star from a 2. I would hear from my boss at the restaurant I work at if a guest had this kind of complaint about service. Hope moms birthday gets better with a pizza cookie. We will be going to the Dobson location if we decide to come again. I heard they are better then the Downtown Gilbert location and as of right now I probably agree."}
{"text":"This place is good when you are dining in, but don't place order's to go...tried it twice and the food just doesn't come out as good. I dined in and had the Alfredo The Dark with chicken and it tasted amazing. When I placed the same order to go, the first time they forgot the chicken, and the second time the pasta was really dry. Overall tasty just not consistent with their food."}
{"text":"Gorgeous 1950's Little Italy ambiance with food as good as the waiters are friendly. The garlic cheesey bread is to die for but pales in comparison to their thin crust pizza. Absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"Yes, Oregano's is a chain.  But I have learned that it is kind of how you measure success in the Phoenix area.  It is an Arizona chain, and therefore not as bad as other national chains.  So, I'm going to go ahead and be honest and say that I love it!

My favorite favorite favorite thing is the Pablo Picasso salad.  It is so yummy.  It has fabulous tortilla strips, seasoned chicken and a delicious dressing.  I am not a salad girl but could most definitely order just this salad for my meal.

My roomie and I usually go too far and are so excited about the salad that we end up ordering the Chicago Deep Dish Pablo Picasso.  It is yummy but a bit much.  I usually end up eating a piece and taking the rest as left-overs (which isn't a bad thing).  

Like some other reviewers, I also enjoy the VERY large glass of water that they give you.  Just one of those small things that gets me.

The outdoor patio is quite nice and the servers are usually very friendly.  It is a good place for big groups, although they won't seat you unless your entire party is there.  Yum- Pablo Picasso!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great atmosphere,  great service, excellent food!! We ordered the Clark street meat and Grandma Gs potato pizza. It was fabulous!! The sauteed onions were the perfect compliment to the pizza! I definitely recommend this place to anyone. We came with four kids, and they weren't a problem."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio tonight and unfortunately I did not catch our waitress's name,  or maybe it is fortunately bc the service was absolutely horrible.   It took forever for our appetizer to come out,  tables that were seated and ordered after we did, got their apps before us.   When our appetizer the boom dip came out we were given two small plates and the silverware.   Dip was good, artichokes were a little tough.   Our pizza finally arrived and we had to use the same plates that we had put our dip on.  Keep in mind that this whole time our waitress never returned to the table,  the appetizer and our pizza was brought by someone else.  We finally got her attention when she came to get the drink order or the next table,  and asked for napkins.   We had to wait several minutes for her to bring them to us,  and when she did she only brought us one each.   We continued to eat and my husband ran out of Pepsi, completely.   We waited,  and waited,  and waited.   Finally he got up and refilled his own drink, walking behind the bar to do so,  which our waitress saw him do.   We finished eating and we waited,  and waited,  and waited. ...again.   Finally we flagged down another employee who was walking by and asked for a box and our check.   Our waitress finally brought the check and I had to ask her for a box as well.  If she had acknowledged the fact that my hubby had to help himself in order to get a refill,  that I was out of my drink,  and that her performance with us had been less than satisfactory, I wouldn't be writing this right now.  We know people have bad days,  get busy,  etc and we don't expect perfection but a little concern would have been nice.  It takes a lot for me to leave a bad review especially based on the wait staff bc I waited tables for years,  but I really think it is called for tonight.   A simple I'm sorry I dropped the ball with you guys would have gone a long way."}
{"text":"Oreganos has really tasty food, but if you come during peak hours be prepared for a wait and a super-loud, kind of cramped dining experience. Every Oreganos I've ever been to has a similar environment, so it's probably part of the brand experience that they're trying to create - but most times my wife and I opt to skip the crowds and just get take-out.

That being said, the food is amazing. Their thin crust pizzas are all super crispy and feature fresh, creative flavor combinations. Try the Grandma G's rosemary chicken potato pizza and the honey gold wings. Leave room for a pizza cookie for dessert!"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever! They told me 30 minutes for a pick up order and took over an hour. Waited around for 40 minutes to get a burnt pizza with no pepperoni when I ordered it. Not like most other Oregano's, this ones ran by dumb college kids. I'd recommend not coming to this location."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were running late to pick up our pizza so I called and spoke with Dan the manager and asked if they could hold off on making our pizza. He said no problem but when I came to pick up our pizza you could tell it was under a heat lamp for over 20 minutes. Guess they decided to make it anyways and not push the order back like Dan said he would. Thanks for the great service Dan we won't be back."}
{"text":"Oregano's never disappoints! Great service and amazing food as usual! I'm vegetarian and but can appreciate very good Italian food! My fave dishes are the Bruschetta, Veggie Wedgie sandwich and the O-Riva pizza. They have fairly nice patio seating which I appreciate as well! If you've never experienced Oregano's I suggest you get your butt over there asap! (Wishing they had better drink specials though)"}
{"text":"They forgot the sauce on my Big Rig to go. SUPER SAD!!! Well, If you look real close there may be some, but it's not enough to taste even the spice. The noodles are mushy and bland, but the chicken is shredded and tasty. This is my first and last time."}
{"text":"Our trip to Oregano's was a bit disappointing.  Instead of the Lawrence's Special pizza, which we loved, we tried their version of the all time favorite, Aunt Margherita.  The ratio of sauce and cheese did not match the toppings. 
I could barely taste any sauce or cheese.  The tomatoes were wedge cut which are not as desirable as slices.  They tended to fall off the pizza.  The tomatoes were not very sweet or tasty either.  It was an average tasting pizza.  Next time, we will stick to what we like.  

As a side note, our server was in training which is fine.  Her hair was in her eyes and face.  It made me wonder if some of those loose hairs fell into our pizza and drinks."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Oregano's!!! They have a unique way they bring together flavors! If you love spicy, then try the El Diablo pasta, sooooo good!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at Oregano's  Monday July 9, 2012.  This was at their new relocation on scottsdale road.  The server and bartender you could just tell they are well trained in providing good customer service... we appreciated it ! and let our server and bartender know we did.  We ate the 14 pc chix wings spicy hot they where not spicy hot just a level below spicy hot we enjoyed them, also had the guacamatony the quac was good  fresh chunky tasty... the very thin pizza crust served with it is well... as always very very salty ! we have eaten this appetizer before same recipe very very salty crust ... heck we just washed it down with a few beers no problem then we split a ribeye salad very good nice fat free serrano pepper dressing good consistent tasting food at this establishment.  We will be back once a month we dine there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine. Once you've had their pizza cookie you'll never eat one anywhere else. I just wish they would build one on the west side of the Valley."}
{"text":"What happened to the wings? I've been working out of state but finally back and first thing on my mind was golden wings!!! Chickens must have been on a diet while I was away. I got these tiny measly portion wings when I was used to the huge old flinstones  wings and all drums!!!! AND for the same price. I asked the waitress what happened and she said that's how they've always been. I beg not!!!! Shame shame shame such a loss!!!"}
{"text":"We loved it!!!   Amazing Bruschetta appetizer!  Fresh tomato with just the right amount of onion, garlic, and shredded parm.  Toasty biased cut bread.  Great!  We had the deep dish pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, and black olives!  Delicious!  Just enough bite to the crust with room for chewy dough also.  Amazing flavor in the sauce and oregano."}
{"text":"We take the kids here and everyone is happy. Great pizzas, pastas, salads, and dessert. It's so popular that there is normally a bit of a wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We love Oreganos!!!! Decided to have dinner there tonight and it was great. We brought our 2 year old who wanted \"ghetty\" and my 9 year old sister who he's never had Oreganos before and they both loved it. We he's great food and great service."}
{"text":"Food is as to be expected at any oreganos! Great food when they get it right which is most of the time. 

We have been here multiple times and I have never thought to do a review of the place however here is what you want to know. 

2017 - there was a nail or staple of some sort in the bottom of my water cup. They did not offer to give a discount when I brought it up or any compensation. They did acknowledge and show the manager. Never had that happen in my life! I was very glad I did not swallow it! They should have been glad as well! They did not seem to think it was as big of a deal as I did. 

2018 - 5/16 - hair in food when served. Big black hair!!Immediately I could see it weaved in and out of the food and I pointed and said no thanks before she could even finish setting it down on the table. This should have never left the line! Do they not wear hairnets or hats? Manger did compensate a replacement however I was very nervous as I ate my food!

I appreciate the communication from I believe the manager as she never did say."}
{"text":"Overall good deal. Not many tables and lots of families so go expecting to wait.  Thin crust is the ultra thin, good sauce flavour and decent (proper) amount of toppings. 
Big rig pasta is saucy with a bit of heat, big meatball..
Worth the wait or call ahead for takeout"}
{"text":"Even though the wait time can get crazy this is always a great place to eat.  Good food. Great service.  And awesome belinis!!  Keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day around 5:30, Ordered Salad and Wings..Now a salad is pretty hard to screw up so I don't give them much credit for that. The wings however were so small looked like pigeon wings and the sauce was marina with ground rep pepper..disgusting flavor profile sent all back. Then the thin pizza came out and it was soggy and greasy and lacked any flavor at all ..One bite and sent it back too. Just plain lousy food..I can get better pizza on campus at 2am for .50 per slice.."}
{"text":"This Oreganos is too small, it's the size of a Carl's Jr. really.. On a Tuesday we had a 2hr wait. Ridiculous. Corporate dropped the ball here this is half the size of the other locations Chandler/Scottsdale.  This would make a good \"carry-out only\" location because that's about how much seating they have. Let's hope the Goodyear store is designed better."}
{"text":"After eating here I noticed many more Oregano's around town, making it a local chain. But that does not change my review in the slightest. After a grewling double header (both wins), the baseball team opted for a late lunch, early dinner here on the way back to the resort. We had a large group, so it took a few minutes (hanging out in the bar and the boys ordering drinks there) before they were able to make spots for us to sit near each other. We were able to get two big booths in the back room. (Sadly, this room had no cable, so the all we got was some black and white movie rather than the football game.... though it didn't bother me much). 

Each table had separate servers, since each had 7 people. Our servers were terrific. They were very attentive and brought us pitchers of water so we never ran out. We had NY style pizzas, lots of drinks, appetizers, and I am sure were just plain loud and roudy through all of it. But, they tolerated us, treated us well and even chimed in the fun. The pizza was great. Our table had the bbq chicken and an everything pizza combo. I loved the bbq, but am just not a combo fan. Everything was delicious and everyone was quite satisfied. The large pizzas are humongous and two seemed plenty for 7 of us (and that left even 6 pieces to take home. ) For appetizers, they ordered the cheesey garlic bread and the wings. All were good. 

This place is fun and lively and has a really great patio. I would have loved to have sat out there. The warm fall weather would have been perfect for it. I would definitely eat here again. They have other stuff too, if you don't do pizza."}
{"text":"Ain't white table cloths and fancy silliness.  It's perfectly timed really well put together ingredients with staff that understands what service means to them and the Customer.  Go figure.  There's always a wait here for a table; and worth it."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, nice staff, and nice food. Yeh pizza is filling but it's delicious, i got really excited when I saw the red jalapeños. Pizza is fantastic, eat all of it because it doesn't make great leftovers."}
{"text":"Oreganos is one of your favorite restaurants.  We have been to several other locations throughout the valley but the food and service quality at this new location is really disappointing.  We always get a salad,  but the quality at this location can be compared to a bag of salad bought at the store, that is a couple days old that needs to eaten or it needs to be tossed soon. The service is hit and miss.  The staff seems to always be in a world of their own, talking loudly and joking around, not bothering about how disruptive it is to the patrons around them. Will probably stick to the other locations even with their longer waits."}
{"text":"Oregano's is no longer family owned and hasn't been for a while,  sadly this is certainly starting to show. Been coming here weekly (if not more often) for the past year. The service has never been an issue, tonight's server was great. But it took 45 mins to get a salad and an hour to get a pasta dish. Seems to be a lot of turnover here lately, why is that? The manager was sympathetic to our long wait."}
{"text":"While visiting Arizona, this is where we decided to go for dinner one night.
Boy, was I in for treat.

Things of note:

1) Memorabilia from the 50s, 60s or whenever it was people thought they were cool, plastered all all over the place.
2) The misters outside. No, not men. Those things that spray mist. See, I thought the word mister was funny to describe those machines.
3) The patio, it's nice out there when the heat isn't too dry. The misters do their job; the patio is awesome, especially at night.

Things that were awesome:

1) The service. Our waiter Kris was friendly, attentive, but not hovering. All smiles and did not begrudge us anything.
2) The Pizza Cookie! This was one of the best desserts I've had in long time. 3 scoops of ice cream on a freshly baked cookie the size of a small plate. Big O on a plate! I wish they had the Choco Macadamia, but all they had was Choco Chip. It wasn't what we wanted, but we devoured it like hyenas to fresh kill. MMMMM.

I had the Pesto Pasta Bowl, complete with the edible bread bowl. That was mighty wonderful, and plentiful. My friends devoured an all-meat pizza and my friend, he sucked down a plate of wings like a Hoover to a carpet, with a mess of red sauce on his fingers and his mouth. Lovely pic. Pollack couldn't have done a better job.

This was a wonderful venture. I begged them that we go back, but alas, we never had the time. I need to go back. We don't have this in SoCal. I wanna go back! I wanna go back! I wanna try more stuff!"}
{"text":"My food was GREAT but my server was even better! Tiffany made the entire family feel welcomed and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!!"}
{"text":"First visit to Oregano's and if I lived in Scottsdale it would not be the last. I ordered a side salad which was huge, three of us shared it and we still had leftovers. The food is an interesting mix of Italian and Southwest. For example I love to try an arabiatta sauce with shrimp and I had the Oregano's equivalent that had a half pound if perfectly cooked shrimp with their own unique spicy sauce served with linguini and garlic bread. What made this dish unique to Oregano's is the cojita cheese and pico de gallo which made it so good. It was spicy and delicious. My friend loved her lasagna recommended by our server Stevey (he was an exceptional waiter) and she liked the spicy kick. The three of us shared a half chocolate chip half white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie and it was melt in your mouth yummy. Maybe it's a good thing I don't live here or that desert would be deadly for my waistline. Great restaurant, great service and spectacular food!"}
{"text":"I have since move to the area and this is regular spot to order thin and deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here for lunch a few weeks ago after church. We have been to their other locations but soooooo happy that they opened one closer to home. Our server was amazing and on top of her game. Very clean and food was great!! No complaints from us!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Brought my friend his first time visit & the Lawrence's original pizza never disappoints.  Friendly service, and shout out to Dan!  He was very personable, thoughtful and kind - made us feel like valued customers and kept saying thank you for coming in.  It's hard to find friendly customer service these days.  We enjoyed the best pizzookie and will be back again soon!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"We had the most amazing experience at this restaurant. The pizza, crust and service were all outstanding!  We fly out tomorrow and I'm not sure if I'll ever enjoy pizza like that again. Definitely Food Network worthy!"}
{"text":"It was quite a wait for a deep dish pizza, but from what i heard it was really good.  I ordered a meatball sandwich and it was so good, but the portion sizes were too big which didn't allow us room for dessert- apparently what they are known for.  Next time we will split an entree and dessert!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, AJ, our server, explained the menu very well to us since it was our first time in.  We wanted pasta but we will return again to try their pizza. The pasta was delicious, I got the baked ziti with meat sauce.  My only complaint is there should have been more meat in a meat sauce, it would have been better off to get extra meatballs on the side. AJ offered us a complimentary pizza cookie to go for our first time in and it was very tasty!! All in all,  a very pleasant experience, nice dinner, great atmosphere...the only drawback was the overzealous jazz music in the background.  Jazz seems to be their theme but it wasn't very fitting, it would have been better to have some Rat Pack goin on!"}
{"text":"The slowest pizza place I have ever seen in my life. All I can say that this place is painfully slow. We were there on a Thursday night around 6:00 pm. When we arrived the parking lot was not full yet we were told there was a 55 minute wait. Really? Looking around I noticed that part of the restaurant was closed off, and no one seated on the patio. The issue was obvious, they were not properly staffed. As tables became empty, it took them 10 minutes or more to clear them. Management here is non existent. I assume the owner is an absentee owner and it shows. Our ordeal was 2 1/2 hours total. We would have left if it had been just me and my wife, but we had family in town and didn't want to waste time trying to go somewhere else. And the wait is not a one time occurrence, we have been here 3 times previous waiting forever for a table usually ending up at the bar. The pizza is just ok, nothing special. Definitely not worth waiting hours for. Our last time here."}
{"text":"Decent food at a relatively inexpensive price.  They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait.  The cheesy bread is really good.  I wasn't impressed with the salad.  The pizzas are enormous!"}
{"text":"Had the thin crust pizza and toasted raviolis both very delicious! The atmosphere and service was excellent I recommend this place. It's not a quick meal the pizza takes some time to make everything made fresh! $42"}
{"text":"If I HAD to pick something to complain about when it comes to Oregano's it would be the amount of time I have to wait.... \"I'm HUNGRY! I want to eat!\" However, if I were asked to complain about something else...I couldn't think of anything (and we all know I complain a lot).

Anyway, every single time I go to Oregano's I am satisfied. The pizzas are great, the pastas are great (the zany ziti specifically), the salads are great...everything is great. 

Let's get to the real point here: The pizookie is the most amazing thing on the face of this planet. It get's it's own paragraph just so I can rant about it. I love the pizookie so much that I will force my stomach to make room so I can put that deliciousness in my belly. I would probably eat 10 if I were given the opportunity.

The service is always friendly and most of the time pretty funny too. The atmosphere is wonderful and it is a great place to go out with friends or family. 

Eat at Oregano's because you will most certainly enjoy it."}
{"text":"Oregano's has always been one of my favorite spots to grab a meal. I have probably been to every location at least once, and a few of them copious amounts of times. So needless to say, when this one opened (it is now the closest location to me...sorry Gilbert) I was stoked. 

My sister and I wanted to grab something to eat before we went and saw Suicide Squad last week, so this was an obvious choice considering it is right across from the Superstition Springs Harkin's (and because it's Oregano's and, let's be real, my day is always a little better with pizza cookie in it).

So we get to Oregano's and are told there is a 45 minute wait, which is cool considering the fact that it literally just opened. It was hotter than hades outside, yet we decided to wait outside because the front lobby was jam-packed with bodies...it wasn't until we couldn't deal with the heat any longer and we went back inside (after waiting for close to 30 minutes) that we overheard the hostess tell another customer that there is a waiting room in the back. Inside. With chairs. -_-

We waited the last little bit and were finally seated. Our waitress greeted us promptly and took our drink order. We started with some boom dip which was on par with the other oregano's locations. I ordered the Julius Caesar Salad Jr. Size because
I don't know what HUMAN being could finish the large size. My sister ordered a pasta which she really liked. My only complaint about my salad is that my chicken was pretty dry.

The food was gone. And then you know what happened next.

PIZZA FREAKING COOKIE. 

We got the chocolate chip, because why change it up when you know you're going to enjoy it? It was delicious. 

I will definitely be back! So glad this location is so close to me! I think my next trip will probably be 5-star worthy because I now know that a waiting room exists."}
{"text":"We got there right at 4 because that's what time yelp said they opened. They really open at 11:00 am. That was hardly the only thing that the yelp site got wrong! This place was great. It was busy, yes, but that's only to be expected on a weekend. We sat out on the patio. It was a little too warm, but later in the fall it will be more pleasant. 
Our server was Josh and he was perfect! Friendly and helpful. Made sure to warn us that the pan pizza takes up to an hour, which is to be expected of any good Chicago style pizza. When our drinks were taking a few extra minutes, he explained that it was because the bartender hand squeezes the grapefruit juice for the Greyhounds to order. You can really taste the difference too. All four of us got entrees and asked to have the pizza brought out whenever it was ready. It was hard to save room!
I got the chicken Caesar salad. You can get it in two sizes, big and bigger. I got the big and ate about a forth of it. It was beautifully seasoned, as was everything. I can only imagine that people complaining about things being too salty either meant spicy, or they are used to a low sodium diet. The chicken on my salad was a little spicy, but it was fine once you mixed it in. 
Hubby had the Italian sausage sandwich and declared that he would never order anything else. Daughter had the shrimp scampi and was in heaven. Son ordered the pasta bowl and said it wasn't as good as my homemade sauce, but still really good. 
Then the pizza came. 
And the angels sang. 
It was to die for and totally worth the 45 minutes it took to bake a pound of cheese and pepperoni. Not greasy at all. Good sauce with lots of oregano (of course) and a perfect crust. We got the 10 inch. The 12 inch might have fed all four of us without entrees, but we like to try lots of things at a new place. Needless to say, we've got leftovers for a few days. 
Any new restaurant has its bumps and hiccups the first few weeks of service. It's to be expected. They've been open for about a month now, and they certainly seem to have their act together now! Service was timely, everyone was friendly and worked well together. Ceiling fans on the patio might be a nice improvement, but that's all I can criticize. The manager Amanda even came by to check on us. I'm very pleased with our whole experience and am very excited to have such a great spot within walking distance of my home. Looking forward to cooler weather when my hubby and I can just walk over for cocktails and maybe a snack in the afternoon. Or maybe just send the kids over to pick up a pizza to bring home. Good work!"}
{"text":"I love this place the bartender KC is awesome and mike the manager is great too our first time here we ask for a Long Island ice tea made a special way after we got our KC came to our table to see how our drink came out everyone is so friendly!!!"}
{"text":"My husband really likes the food, he can't stop coming here, 
Good service. All employees always with a smile."}
{"text":"There's plenty of reasons to check out Oreganos. 
1. Free cheesy-bread while you are waiting 
2. One of a kind Crispy thin crust pizza with amazing toppings
3. Decent drink menu (beer and liquor)
4. The original pazookis! (I heard from a friend this is where it originated, not rock bottom) - it's basically a fresh baked cooked topped with ice cream
5. Free mint and fortune cookies

This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 8-10 times over the past 5 or 6 years. 

Consistent: 
- The wait. Doesn't matter if it's lunch or dinner, the wait is ridiculous. On the positive side, the reception desk kept the cups of iced water coming. 
- The food is always good, which probably explains the wait. I strayed from my carmelized onion, gorgonzola pizza to try their spinach salad. Not a single regret - it was super tasty! 
- That damn pizookie. Even if the food in general sucked, I'd come here just for the pizookie... mmmmmm. 

If you haven't been... you should go!"}
{"text":"Some of the best most personable service staff my Wife and I have met. 

The people are great here and the food completes the experience.

We've never had to wait longer than 30 min for a seat and the food is worth it. If you have to wait on a Friday or Saturday night grab yourself a drink or help yourself to the complimentary thin crust pizza they hand out. 

You won't be disappointed with this establishment, they have a recipe for their food and customer service and it works."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday, and got violently sick. I ordered a draft beer, and there was chunks of green mold floating in it. They bring me a \"new\" one, and what do you know- that one has mold floating in it too. Didn't take a sip, by the way. This happened four times! So I just ordered a bottled beer. 

To eat, I had the spinach and artichoke dip, which is what made me sick. I was throwing up so violently the next two days, one of my ribs broke. They need to acknowledge their problems and solve them. 

Now, I'm reporting them to the health department."}
{"text":"Big rig is the best pasta I've ever had! Get it with chicken-it's super thinly shredded and yummy. This Oregano's is smaller than some of he others I've been too, but still really fun!"}
{"text":"Love Oreganos, the pizza crust is thin and flavorful.  The guacamole is to die for.  And the staff is responsive and friendly."}
{"text":"Do not use the Nowait app.  We registered with the app and arrived on time.  Was told we had to sit outside in 105degree heat or wait another 20 minutes. Asked to speak to manager who was rude and unaccommodating. We left.  Doubt I would come back."}
{"text":"This place was great. The customer service was really nice and everyone was friendly. Our foods came out really promptly and hot which is a plus with Italian food. The environment was really clean and well decorated. Will come again!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and enjoy it, however I do a few things differently than many of the other reviewers and that's probably why I have little to no complaints.

One, I usually go during the off hours. It might get crowded while I'm there, but my family and I rarely have to wait to be seated.

Two, we basically order the same things over and over, which is why we only go there when we're craving something specific. Oddly enough, it's not their pizza. Oregano's has some great pastas, meatball subs, and chicken wings. 

Their services ranges from lacking to pretty good. I haven't had anyone yet that was horrible, the worst was just negligent and had to be flagged down for refills or extra napkins, but she wasn't rude or anything like that. I enjoy it overall, but probably because I don't actually eat the pizza as the few times I did I found it decent, but not worth the price. I do recommend it, but not for the reasons most people would probably go to it for."}
{"text":"Love the location, decor, beer and wine selections but I love the Chicago style pizza even more! 
Our pizza had pepperoni, meatballs, onions, olives, mushrooms and spinach and they were very generous with the toppings too. 
Service is friendly and if it's your first visit they explain the menu and help you out if you're not sure what to order. 
The menu is full of great pasta dishes, salads and pizza options so we will definitely return to try some of the family style plates."}
{"text":"ordered a cookie, and it was easily the worst cookie I've ever had. Nothing but dough and grease. Not what I was expecting considering the pizza cookies at other locations are amazing and include ice cream."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews about the wait I was skeptical about coming here but I tried it anyway. The service was outstanding. Friendly people were all over this place ready for anything. I ordered the potato rosemary pizza. Good pizza isn't rushed. Why are people so impatient. The pizza was amazing. The atmosphere was inviting. I will definitely be going back. Oh yeah. I forgot my card going out to my car, but the waitress tracked me down. The only thing I was thinking was how can I give them a bigger tip."}
{"text":"I have to say we were disappointed.  We found out they had a thin crust pizza, and we were \"yes!\".  But the thin cheese pizza (which, in my opinion, is the best way to judge dough and sauce) had no flavor.  Really, you only tasted cheese.  Sauce had absolutely no flavor, and the dough was dough--brought nothing to the flavor of the pizza.  Now, I'll definitely say that a lot of people had stuff on their pizza--and perhaps that's how you're supposed order at this restaurant.  But a good pizza should stand on its own, and this one really didn't.  We had to add Oregano, parmesan, and salt just to give the pizza some flavor.
We had the Calamari--they were strips rather than rings.  They were deep fried with a heavy batter, and the oil was likely old.  The batter came dark, the marinara was too thick, and the calamari itself tasted old."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service.

My wife and I took our two grandsons, age 5 and 1 for pizza and pasta. Restaurant made an accommodation and seated us quickly.  After that, the experience went downhill.

We ordered a pizza and kid's meal.  Our server came by 3 times to tell us the food would be out soon.  After telling the same story 3 times, you think he would come up with a new story, as the old one became more unbelievable as time went on.   Pizza finally came, but no kid's pasta meal.  Had to request that 2 more times as well as the kid's milk refill.

Finally had enough and asked for the manager.  He finally showed up (a recurring theme here, slow as turtles).  I told him the pizza was good but the service was poor.  He didn't appear to much care what I thought but did take the kid's meal ($2.99) and the .69 milk refill off the bill.  Didn't much offer anything else.  Table next to us had some issues as well.

We have eaten at other Oregano's in the past and always found both food and service to be good.  This is a newer location but has been here longer enough that they should have the customer service piece down.  Apparently not.  

I'll drive by this location, there are too many other choices locally that know how to treat the customer. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We love to sit outside in the patio area and have a glass of wine with dinner.  Have never been disappointed with our meal.  Only thing is sometimes sitting outside the server will not check on us as often as they should.  We have to flag them down"}
{"text":"We had a baby shower here today and our server, Serena, was AMAZING!!!! There were 19 of us and she was right on top of things!!!! She has a great personality and made the shower perfect!!! She suggested certain foods and they were amazing!!! She made our special occasion even more special!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great leftovers. Have to learn to manage the wait like any popular place and if you can do that, you're good!"}
{"text":"I'm from MN and was introduced to O's in 1994. I insist on returning each time I visit town. The stuffed Sproccoli is my soulmate and Grandma G's 'za makes me weak in the knees.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I suddenly feel the need to book a flight to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service! I was introduced to Oregano's by my sister's a few years ago and now everytime I come to the Phoenix area I have to make a stop for their deep dish pizza. This was my families first time visiting and they were satified with their food as I was my first time. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Got the Oregano's favorite salad \"to go\" - extremely disappointed with the amount of toppings on it, A very very small amount compared to the amount of lettuce that was underneath. 


Frankly, I could've gone to Chop Shop to get the skimpy toppings but I chose Oregano's because I had a really good experience with their yummy pizza the other day. 

And to the girl that answered the phone, do you really have to speak so fast that I cannot understand a word you say? It's 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the place wasn't packed when I got there. 

Disappointing!"}
{"text":"These people really know how to do pasta!

Shrimp Diablo Pasta is my favorite. It's spicy and so good!

 Atmosphere is fun. Service is wonderful. We were lucky enough to get Kaylee on one of their typically busy nights. She was professional, quick and amazing! 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 4:30 today on a Thursday evening and noticed it was pretty busy. We put our name down, had a table for 4 and it was a 40 minute wait time so I looked at it as a good thing.

If you have to wait 40 minutes on a Thursday than people are coming here for a reason.

When we were seated it was a pretty good atmosphere, very nice, clean and our table was a half circle table with loads of room.

My oldest son and I ordered the Big Beef sandwich and my wife had a pasta dish with a mushroom sauce. My youngest son had the shrimp scampi.

The sandwich I had was phenomenal, I mean every bite was tasty, the bread was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle but the havrati cheese and spice from the pablano peppers was the key here. My kids loved their food and my wife did as well.

We are coming back my wife and I for a date night. Absolutely fantastic place...food, atmosphere, drink and the whole experience!"}
{"text":"My second review for this place and I have to say, our waitress Sarah from our last visit recognized me and my family. I have to believe because of our last visit and the fact that we were very nice to her, she stopped by to talk with us. 

Our waitress today Kaylee was equally as nice and both Sarah and Kaylee talked to us for quite a long time. Very friendly staff as usual, the food was rediculously good as well. The deep dish pizza was very tast, the cheese was chewy like it's supposed to be and the sauce was rich. 

The mild hot wings had such a good flavor, the balsamic dressing on our salad was good as well. Just a fantastic experience. Thank you Sarah and Kaylee for being nice to me and my family!!!"}
{"text":"Checking in on yelp made a huge difference! Didn't have to wait forever with a bunch of hangry kids lol. 
Down side is we all got upset stomachs shortly after the meal  our service was great and timely."}
{"text":"Two words: cookie pizza...  That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"A friend of a friend was telling us about this place on Sunday morning, and how awesome their pizza is.  It sounded awesome, but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to wait long for a table.  When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long.

We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from.  We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under $80.

Oh, make sure you sit outside... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party.  The women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there.  Keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full bar, so if you're going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck."}
{"text":"Tried tonight, and the food was good, but our server was really frazzled. Pizzas we can recommend are the Bistro and The Uno. Everyone agrees that these are amazing, and we also really liked the calamari our waitress recommended. Salads to try included the Julius Ceasar, House salad and the Oregano. Many awesome varieties here."}
{"text":"oregano's i'm so so so so sorry that i tend to overlook you.  never again.  i promise.  

oregano's has never let me  down.  well, once, but it's because i forgot they used fresh parmesan.  so when they asked if we wanted parmesan, i said  \"yes\"  and then was mortified when instead of a shaker of powder, there was fresh parmesan sprinkled  all over my pizza.  i like fresh parmesan on my pasta, but for some reason  i think it ruins a pizza.  this is a personal thing, so i can't hold it  against them.

i absolutely love that oregano's makes the patio the focal  point of the restaurant.  even in the summer when it's deathly hot, they somehow manage to make the patio appealing.  the misters cool it down, but don't turn the patio into a swamp.   

the last time we went i was STARVING after  a very very long day that i may or may not have complely forgotten to eat.  by the time we arrived, the wait was 30 min. for 2 people *sigh*.  (there had been a sign outside NYPD pizza boasting no wait and my belly was tempted).  \"no\" i reminded myself \"oreganos always has a wait and it's  always worth it.\"   the host told us that we  could sit at the bar if there was room and just to let him know if we found a spot and wanted to stay there.  so we  went to the bar, but it was pretty busy and there weren't 2 seats together.  the bartender offered  to move another chair around and a very nice couple said they could move down.  the bartender then took care  of taking us off of the list, which was nice.  the word \"hospitality\" came to mind (what a novel idea in the industry....)

i eyeballed a margarita and my hungry thirsty belly did a little dance.  i never would have considered getting a margarita here, but i'm so very glad i did.  it was quite possibly one of the best margaritas i've ever had.   great beverage, check!

knowing full-well that the pizza would take a good 30-45 minutes to come out i knew i had  to have an appetizer.  the calamari is always good, but i wanted something else.  once again, i ventured out of my comfort zone and remembering that once upon a time someone had told me the toasted ravioli were good, ordered those.  oh.my.goodness!!! the cheese was sooooo soft.  it was  like liquid gold.  i forgot to share and actually ended up scarfing most of the ravioli down.  amazing appetizer, check!

then the pizza came and it was scrumptious! (as i have come to expect)  however, they forgot to put pepperoni on it. BUMMER!  and it's not like they can just fire another one up really quick.  however, the bartender went and got  us some pepperoni -- not the cold handful, here's your damn pepperoni, now you can't complain stuff, but they actually heated the pepperoni up and it was  a PLATEFULL, so it wasn't QUITE the same, but pretty darn close! fixing an order-gone-wrong, check! (although it would have  been an added bonus to have a manager address the problem  with the customer.  but that's just me.)

i want to give it 5 stars, but i just can't. not yet.  i need to have a few  more amazing experiences there and then i'll probably bump it up."}
{"text":"Wait is way too long, they need to train servers to handle \"rush hours,\" or they are going to be losing business."}
{"text":"i didn't think it was possible for Oregano's to exceed my expectations.  You can see a previous review of their North Scottsdale location to know that the bar has been set pretty high (on an already high expectation-level from many years' experience...)   

i was somewhat hesitant to go on the debut week of the Glendale (Peoria?  i think it depends on what side of the street you're on...) location, but i've been watching the progress and couldn't stand it anymore, so today was the day. 

note:  there hasn't been a single time i've driven by since they opened on Tuesday that they haven't been packed.  i had to check the time yesterday (NOT lunchtime during the week when most normal folk would be working...) when they were full to the gills.  

when we arrived, we were quoted an hour and 45 minute wait.  Since i'm accustomed to a 45 minute wait there anyway, this seemed perfectly reasonable.  and we were prepared.  the waiting area is extremely comfortable:  well shaded by the building and stocked with heaters above the seating area for when it gets a bit chilly.  beverages were offered to those of us waiting and pizza samples were a-plenty.  managers were graciously accommodating tables of 10+ and 20+ amidst the rest of us.  no.one.looked.stressed.  not even remotely.  everyone was smiling, polite, and attentive.  let me emphasize that last word:  despite the fact that the restaurant was crawling with customers, the staff was still friendly and ATTENTIVE (without even blinking, i might add).

The food was delicious as always.  Quality did not suffer even a little bit from the other experiences i've had (although i was expecting a small slump due to logistical issues of a new restaurant and not quite having a \"flow' yet).  

This is a location that is sure to be a huge success in years and years to come.  So glad we have one that is closer than a 30-minute drive!!! :D"}
{"text":"The main course came out before the appetizer :( and considering their portions this is not a good thing. Seeing how much food we were served made us tell them to x the app. 
I was really hoping to have the artichoke lasagna but came in a week too early for it to make it to the menu. 
My partner loved the Diablo shrimp."}
{"text":"I'm from L.A. and let me tell you something....we need an Oregano's out here. The place was great, the staff was running around with shirts that read \"LEGALIZE MARINARA\" on the back, we sat on the outside patio, the ambiance was great, a very up beat and happy place to be. This is no place for any Don to have a sit down at \"CAPISH\".I went there with a close friend and we started off with a beer and some Kick Butt Garlic Bread and let me tell you something the name suits it perfectly, a long piece of Italian bread smothered in garlic and tons of ooey gooey cheese, this was heaven. We ordered the El Picasso Chicago Style stuffed Pizza MAMA MIA, this was the best Pizza I have ever had, it was full of chicken and cheese, and all kinds of great stuff let me tell you, this was not dinner it was a life changing experience, I had no room for desert, as a matter of fact we boxed up 1/2 the pizza and took it to go, and that was only an 8 inch. This place is great, and thankfully for you out here in Phoenix they're scattered all over Phoenix, too bad they're not in L.A."}
{"text":"Usually my go to place, but this visit was horrible. Went for my birthday, ordered my usual Pablo Picasso salad and Alfredo of the dark pasta. After waiting well over an hour just to be seated (on a Wed night after 8pm) then waited an additional hour for the food. With many apologies along the way, we were starving, it sounded like we were whale watching our stomachs were making so much noise. Salad came wilted and pasta came so overcooked it just disintegrated in your mouth. I told waiter, and yet even though waited an hour for my food, they miraculously had a new pasta dish there in under 5 minutes. Exactly the same thing, overcooked and pasty. I complained again, asked for a manager and no one ever came, but waiter said he took it off my bill. Rating I give a big fat zero. Happy birthday to me. Feel free to pass this joint. Oh by the way, the yelp \"Join the Waitlist\" check in doesn't work."}
{"text":"Oregano's is always a great call! I could eat there every meal, every day of the week....but try to do so sparingly because of the downfall for my diet. The prices are not bad at all and they have 1/2 portions for everyone's appetite. If you are in a hurry...they also do very efficient takeout orders. Also, the servers are always very animated and helpful. Thanks Oregano's for many years and many great meals!"}
{"text":"Love Oregano's...it's our family go-to for lunch and dinner!  Only problem is the long wait...so we always try to go during slow hours.  Love the vino bambino salad, pizzas are great, the Italian Gold wings are such a great surprise...honey mustard sauce on crisp wings...delish.  The bellini's are to die for...and we can't ever leave without a pizza cookie for dessert....our kids fought us over the last one...and they won.  We will have to order two next time!  

Our family from Austin is visiting again this Christmas...and Oregano's is first on their list!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat if you like Italian food very Flavorful. Servings are big portion's  Anti pasta is huge. Great place"}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere, great service.  

My wife and I really enjoyed our visit on Saturday night.  We were told there was a 30 minute wait and that was no surprise as the parking lot was full.  We went outside in the picnic table area to wait. The weather was perfect and the view of the mountain at dusk was beautiful. The wait ended up only being 15-20 minutes.

We were seated inside, but next time if the weather is nice I will ask to be sat outside. 
We split the Oregano's favorite salad and it was very tasty and refreshing. I ordered El Diablo pasta and it was spicy:) The server warned me it was spicy, but I often hear that when eating out and the food rarely turns out spicy.  I was pleasantly surprised it had some heat(not too much) and the flavor was right on.

My wife ordered Alfredo the dark and she was expecting fettuccine noodles and it came out with a thick macaroni noodle. (Forgive me for not knowing the name of the pasta) She did not care for the noodle, most likely because she was expecting fettuccine. She told the server (Brandon??) that she didn't care for it and he was very professional and showed that he wanted to make it right for her.  The manager on duty also came over and demonstrated great customer service:)
We ended up just sharing my pasta cause the serving size was huge and we were both almost full from the salad.
The only negative was not having the type of noodle listed on the menu, but that is a corporate thing.  The server and manager were great.  So thank you! We will be back:)"}
{"text":"It is a sad time for long time fans of Oregano's as they have stop offering all drums on the Buffalo wings. You now can choose 10 or 14 and it is 60% regular wings and 40% drums. Sucks. It was the only place where you could get all drums. Now they don't set themselves apart as far as the Buffalo wings go. I gave it a two stars only cause the size is still descent. Oh well, when I want wings, it don't matter now and I won't have to wait an hour to be seated."}
{"text":"The place is good and I love the dessert cookie. As I am getting older I am getting heartburn from tomato based foods. But it is worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"I tried not to like Oregano's that much. It's always so crowded, I thought if I could just make myself not like it then that would be one less crowd to fight through, one less line to wait in, one less cramped bar to stand at shouting drink orders. 

To no avail. 

My ladyfriend and I went in this Saturday and it was slammed, predictably. I was starving and they told us the wait was an hour but we knew we might be able to yoink a couple seats at the bar and order from there. And we did: we patiently and methodically stalked some poor geriatric couple and pounced on their seats like velociraptors the second they pushed them back. 

We got a pair of diet sodas and ordered a salad, which came out quickly, especially considering the crowd. We ordered an excessive amount of pesto pizza because I was ready to gnaw my hand off from hunger and it also came out pretty fast. 

We didn't need the pizzookie (or Pizza Cookie, as non-BJ's aficionados would call it), but we succumbed to temptation and above average saleswomanship and ordered one. We washed it down with a beer and a glass of wine for the lady and were finished within 45 minutes of sitting down, and the bill was barely thirty dollars. 

For a meal like that I was amazed. And bordering on paralysis due to excessive food intake (I dabble in competitive eating, but obviously was unprepared on this occasion)."}
{"text":"A while since we've been to oregano's. PV Mall. It was a terrible dining experience. We were seated at 7 PM and The server never took our dinner drinks until 710 my friend ordered Italian wedding soup and garlic bread and I ordered ziti   The soup came at at 7:25. I asked to see the manager she'll be right here the server said. I didn't get my Ziti  until 745 it came in a bread bowl that was completely burned and hard. Again I ask for the manager and was told she'd be right there about two minutes later she came and I said well we asked for your 20 minutes ago and she got very nasty said I was just told 10 seconds ago was very patronizing and condescending she apologize for the late dinner and then she said she would pay for the dinner   She kept telling me that the bread bowl with just the garnish it wasn't really saying my question to her was why would you even serve something it looks like this is just a  garnish very very upset we won't be back"}
{"text":"630 pm on a Saturday night,  the place was busy...and our server Colleen was amazing!  She was super friendly and always smiling.   She kept our drinks full and made sure we were always happy!  Colleen is  hands down the best server we have had in a very long time!   Colleen,  thank you for making our night enjoyable!,,,,, 

Our food was also tasty and hot!  I left extra stuffed.... Delicious"}
{"text":"The place was quite busy, but was able to get our group in fairly quickly. Ordering was timely. Atmosphere was vibrant, noisy and colorful. Great for the college crowd. 

The partisan cheese flatbread with guacamole was ok. Greek Salad was fresh but the dressing was not very flavorful. 
The pasta dishes were plentiful but could have been more flavorful.  One in our party ordered a deep dish pepperoni pizza and was warned it would take s long time. It did. The rest of the party were almost finished by the time it came. 

Would I go back?  Probably to try other things. 
The pasta dishes were ok. More like production food. Volume but ok in flavor."}
{"text":"I used to think the stereotypical Italian grandmother who asks if you're hungry and then feeds you regardless of your answer, and then feeds you again, and then makes you a sandwich, and then brings you a canolli, and then packs something for you to take when you leave was just a myth.  Then I actually met one like that.

Oreganos reminds me of just such a grandmother.  The wait is terrible.  Really.  Bring a fucking book. Better yet, load the back of your pickup with a generator, a wide screen TV and your favorite game console.  Or better yet, bring a DVD player, your favorite movie and some lawn chairs and make everyone happy.  Cause you'll all be sitting there for a very long time.  You will finish the movie.  You might meet the love of your life, court, get engaged, become disillusioned and divorce before you get called for a table.

Deal with it.  It's pretty much worth it.

The pasta dishes are all great.  I like most of the sandwiches except for the turkey.  The pizza is good but it takes a while.  I like all of the salads.  The portions here are fucking obscene.  That's right.  That's the only way I can put it across to you so that you'll understand.  Plan to share if you don't want to be eating the leftovers you took home for a week.

If you don't believe me, you'll have plenty of time to check it out for yourself while you're waiting for your table.  Because like I said, it's going to be a while.  This is good because it gives you time to build up an enormous appetite so you can begin to contemplate actually finishing your meal.  You may even believe somehow that you're going to do it.  But don't kid yourself.  It's not possible.

The saving grace here is that the food is quite good.  Kind of a spicy take on Italian with a few curve balls thrown in just to mess with you.  Try the UFOs.  They're disgusting.  Disgustingly good.  You'll hate yourself in the morning, but you'll enjoy every delicious bite.

When the bill comes, you'll be surprised.

I paid what?  For all of that?  Don't make a big deal about it or try to get your waiter to double check it for you.  It really is that cheap.  Why do you think you and 40 other otherwise reasonable people waited for over an hour just to sit in a kitchy booth and be doted on?

What's that? You ate it all? No way. Are you sure?  Geeze dumbass, now look what you did.  How are you ever gonna have room for their signature warm cookie pizza treat thing with ice cream on top?  It's the whole reason you go.  I tried to warn you."}
{"text":"A friend who used to live in Phoenix took us here. Like another reviewer, I thought they were known for their pizza but the pizza was my least favorite out of all the dishes (trust me, I live in Little Italy in San Francisco so I have had my share of pizza). 

The portions and the cheap prices are out of control but I guess that means you get a big bang for your buck. We went on a weekday for lunch and didn't have to wait which was great."}
{"text":"Not a place if you are in a hurry but worth the wait have never had a problem food always fresh"}
{"text":"Waited and hour outside..got seated and now another hour and 10 minutes no appetizers yet. I knew it was a mistake to try again. Fix this please!"}
{"text":"Manager was extremely rude and argumentative. I hadn't even begun to explain my issue before he started going off on me. Will not be returning to this location or probably any other oregano's for that matter. Thanks for the worst experience. The pizza wasn't even that great for the price, time and rudeness I had to deal with."}
{"text":"Had one of the most incredible experiences at Oreganos this evening. Not only was the food to die for, but our waitress, Miranda was seriously one of the best of the best. Typically, I normally I have to ask for my drinks to be filled, extra napkins for wings and even extra plates for the wings but she brought them out without us even having to ask. 

We ordered 6 different dishes. All of which exceeded our expectations: the garlic wings,  the bruschetta, the big rig, the lady is a scampi, and the stuffed rigatoni. And don't forget the calamari.

Thank you so much again Miranda for the best dining experience we have had in a while. I would recommend this Oreganos location to anyone."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this particular location and the food was just okay. I think the one on Scottsdale  road is better.  But my server was amazing ! Her name is Dru be sure and ask for her  you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"AMAZING,  I wish could stay longer in Arizona to try out all the food there. Idk why people are giving low reviews because of a busy wait time for seating."}
{"text":"Oregano's is a favorite for us. We usually start with cheesy garlic bread and Italian gold wings. Sharing one of the salads is also on the list. Then dinner depends on the mood. We have tried the Big Beef, Original Italian, and Big Meatball sandwiches, the Big Rig with Chicken, Alfredo the Dark with Chicken, Mom's Sausage and Peppers, Original Bollo Pasta (this is all you can eat!!), Lady is a Scampi, and El Diablo Shrimp Pasta, Deep Dish and thin crust pizzas, and of course the Pazookie! Everything is always delicious and the portion sizes are big enough to share. We always have leftovers and leave stuffed. By far the closest to Chicago pizza in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Second time here, second time they missed up and remade our food. Food is tasty though. Love the pesto bake!"}
{"text":"While in Phoenix we were told that the best place for pizza was Oregano's. So the senora and I decided to swing by and check things out. We did check in a bit before the crowd arrived and were seated right away. The place was pretty cool and old style musica played in the back ground. I kept waiting for Frank Sinatra to make an entrance.

Our server was very nice and gave us the tour of their menu and drinks. We ordered drinks and then decided on a Chicago styled deep dish pizza with dinner salad. It took about 45 minutes to get our pizza but when it arrived looked sabroso. The pizza was very good but I must admit that the tomato sauce used needed a bit more spices because it tasted a bit bitter. 

Other than that, the pizza and salad hit the spot and enjoyable to eat. It will be on our list of future pizza eating when we are on Phoenix."}
{"text":"I met Andrea K. here for lunch. 
I haven't been to Oregano's in nearly 2 years and I've never been to this location.

I thought I'd arrive a few minutes early so we wouldn't have to wait since Andrea was on her lunch break.

I forgot how stingy and rude they can be about seating you until your entire party has arrived. OK so if I was alone I would still get seated at a 2 or 4 top so whats the BFD if she hasn't arrived yet!

I wait and look at the menu, which they have redone since my last visit, what an eye-crossing mess they turned it into.

YAY! Andrea arrives we get seated and order our drinks. The waiter does not tell Andrea that the Ice tea is flavored, she asks if he minded getting her a soda instead.  Waiting for that soda...................................
Since we are seated right next to the drink station I offer to grab her soda for her........I pretty much get yelled at by some waitress,she gets it for her instead.

OK so I ended up ordering something I have never tried before the \"Veggie Wedgie\" (wedge-cut foccocia bread  with dusted sauteed eggplant, fresh portabello mushrooms and provolone cheese and baked. It's then stuffed with roma tomatoes, spinach, goat cheese and feta cheese, along with an aioli dressing placed on the side for dipping.) And a small dinner salad.

They have also changed the salads since my last visit, it used to be romaine and mozzarella now its spring greens and gorgonzola.......either way its good.

My sandwich arrives and each half is bigger than my head,WOW!
 it looks good too.............Looks can be deceiving....it was not so good.....the eggplant was bland and cold, the sandwich did not seem \"baked\" enough and over all not really much flavor going on, and how on earth they thought I could dip that huge thing into their tiny cup of Over garlicked aioli is beyond me.

When waiter boy comes by I tell him its not so good, he takes it away with no hesitation. Manager come by and offers me something else, I really am full and didn't want anything but let him oblige me with a slice anyhow. I really am against getting any other food items after having to send something back....

Out comes my slice.........well cheese is sliding to one side and it's covered in a black soot as is the pineapple....maybe it fell on the floor to teach me a lesson??? I should have took a picture! All the other slices I saw go by looked pristine...what happened to mine?

I wasn't planning on eating it anyway, I was full.

I apologize to the waiter about the sandwich again and her assures me that its no problem they always encourage people to try something new, if you don't like it they will take it off the bill no problem. ~I thought that was great customer service on their part.

So they did take off my sandwich and my slice from the bill, Thanks Again guys!

~Andrea and I are still chatting.........
~Waiter: \"can I get you some boxes?\"
~ Us: \"OK\"
5 minutes later
~Waiter: \"Do you need help boxing that up?\"
~US: \"No thanks\"
5 minutes later
~ Waiter: \"Can I Get you a to go cup for your drinks?\"

Geesh I Think we can take a hint, I guess we'll get going....there wasn't any people waiting to be sat so whats the rush??

3 stars for Their hospitable understanding over the bad sandwich"}
{"text":"I think Oregano's is a cute place.

Once in awhile if I happen to drive by and there is a parking spot I'll stop in for lunch.

I Like their pizza for what it is.....very thin and kinda bite size, cut into squares.

Their house salad is good, Love the Raspberry Vinaigrette. LOVE the Italian Gold Wings and They Absolutely have The BEST Pizookie around. Others places may try to imitate but should just really give it up* *cough** B.J.s**cough**

 I wish it had more room. I wish it had more parking. I hate the wait.

I'm giving 3 stars based on the Pizookie, everything else is just mediocre especially if you have to deal with the wait/parking issue.

It's definitely worth checking out if you have never been.

I loved that one day I stopped by with my dog and even though they don't allow dogs on their patio they did let me bring her if I agreed to keep her in her kennel, Fine by me cause I was not about to leave her in the car!!"}
{"text":"Got there at 5:30 and I was told the wait us an hour and a half! Forget that! 

Also the entrance is set up so bad it's annoying! You check in, enter, and exit all into a narrow doorway! Really?! 

The first '1-star' I ever gave! Maybe they'll work the kinks out eventually but the doorway will remain the same!"}
{"text":"Exceedingly disappointed.  We called in an order on a Saturday evening at 8:05pm.  Pizza and a salad, no modifications, just their off the menu items.  Was told it would be done by 9pm.  Arrived at 8:55 and was told that \"the girl who took the order didn't enter it\".  \"It will take 10 minutes to get it done, is that ok.\"  Sure.  Leaving now at 9:25pm after the manager offered us her special discount of $7 off of a $35 dinner.  Doubt I will be back and hopefully others won't expect accurate or prompt service on a Saturday night.  Sad that in this day of social media and competition for the dinner dollar that more care or concern isn't happening here."}
{"text":"Oreganos is BY FAR the nastiest \"Italian\" food you'll ever eat. You've never had real Italian if you think this food is good. Ordered a stuffed pizza (which, let's clarify... there is no such thing as a stuffed. Pizza. It's just a pie at that point) and I asked for 3 basic things. Sausage, pepper, & onion. I gave them like 20 min before I showed up to pick it up and it still wasn't ready AND my order was wrong. Sausage, pepperoni & onion is what I got. How?! How?!! Then I sat and waited some more for it!  I get home and not only is this not cut (maybe it's not customary to do so, so w.e.) but it's practically 70% cheese (if you have children PLS supervise BC as an adult I almost choked). A thin slice of sausage at the bottom and raw chopped onion throughout. It fell apart once I cut it and was a total mess to eat. For $28 this was NOT worth it. And don't get me started on their disgusting thin crust pizza. Can you say extra salt?! Save yourself a trip and get a decent slice of NYPD pizza."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  We usually go to the one in Mesa on Dobson and Southern but this place is just as good. They took away the soup I really liked and replaced it with a wedding soup that is just ok.  Every time I have it, it is a bit salty.  I am not a wine snob but I love red wine and there is just something special about red wine with any type of marinara sauce.  I will give kudos for the portions.  The service is always great too.  It seems like everyone who works there either goes to ASU or went there.  The environment is great and would recommend to anyone ."}
{"text":"Número one-o. Never let's me down. I had family come in from Mexico and now they can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat!  We've been to 3 different Oreganos and the ambiance is the same at all 3 locations which makes it an appealing place to go.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this with a statement: I usually LOVE Oregano's!   

This particular Oregano's is terrible.  The wait seemed a bit long for a Thursday night,  but that could have been a sign that the food was going to be amazing... Not the case.  The service was pretty bad; we had our food picked out for about 20-25 minutes before the server came back to us to take our order.  We ordered the Cheesy Bread as an appetizer, Garlic Chicken Lasagna, and Pasta Basta with Meatballs.  We were not given the opportunity to order drinks after looking at the menu.  

Our cheesy bread was fine- not great, too much cheese... but out on time.

When our entrees came out, they got it wrong- the Lasagna was the wrong type of lasagna entirely.  My boyfriend was starving so ate it, as the waitress was not going to come back.  Eventually, someone from the kitchen came out with the correct lasagna for my boyfriend.  The waitress apologized and asked if everything was okay and walked away before I could tell her that the Pasta Basta was terrible.  I ate a small amount as changing orders was not going to happen.  

Crappy food, crappy service."}
{"text":"This would have been a 5 Star review if our amazing server Krysten was there. The serves was ok, nothing to brag home about. It took awhile for us to be seated, as 4 servers standing by the outside bar just keep looking at as. We decided to sit outside, in the shade. We gets me is, I heard servers complaining about not having anyone to serve, yet when someone is seated in their section the complain about having to walk and to the work. Also, hearing them complain about how hot it is, and how she doesn't like to wear bras, and what she does as soon as she clocks out. I could go on and on about this servers life story since she just sat behind the bar with the others just chatting away. Oreganos needs to step up their game."}
{"text":"Oregano s contacted me and made this right.  I'm so glad they cared enough to earn our business back!"}
{"text":"We love it here!  The service MAKES this location!  Not once have we had less than excellent service, and tonight is no exception.  Looking to have a \"comfort food\" dinner after a busy Monday, we ended up at our go-to restaurant for pasta.  JAKE did an amazing job.  Best waiter ever!!  He didn't know we had had a rough go at an earlier appointment, rescheduled clients, etc., but he made us feel as though he did.  The food, as always, was superb.  Thank you for making our Monday and having the most delicious pasta this side of Chicago!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place more stars but if I'm gonna pay this much at a minimum don't overlook something. In the pic is a sausage link. WAY OVER DONE. No snap* on it jus a straight chew*. PLUS I came in on a slow Saturday and was handed my dish by the manager. So no darn excuses how that left the kitchen. The pasta was really good and deserved better prep by the grill person. 
In addition, it was my first time ordering the dish. So I asked which was better, meatball or sausage. The bartender ordered both for me to try. It was on the tix too.  It didn't come with the meatball when it arrived. Then I asked about it and an extra charge was placed for the meatball. NOT COOL"}
{"text":"Probably the most overrated place in the Phoenix area. There pizza tastes way too much like their canned tomato sauce and there is always a wait to be seated. 

That being said there food overall is OK. There meat salad and cal-zones are good and the servers are friendly. For all the people out there giving it more than 3 stars: try other pizza places like spinatos, la grande Orange, pizzeria Bianca."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here at Oregano's. It's a lively place. The food is good and the pizza is better. We start with the cheese bread and calamari. My son loves the deep dish with meatballs (plan on ordering right away as it takes abut 40 minutes and worth the wait) My favorite is the Margherita pizza. When I am in Flagstaff or Scottsdale I eat at Oregano's"}
{"text":"Home made receipies with a Southwestern kick! My wife and I shared a 12 inch Margharhita pizza with pepperoni and our guests had the shrimp scampi. There is about a half pound of large shrimp so if you love the little critters, it will make you happy. Our pizza crust (thin) was perfect and topped with fresh ingredients. Service was top notch and we can't wait to go back when we visit again. The menu has the history of the family and the mom and dad's recipes are noted on the  items in the menu. They have included some Southwestern fair such as substituting poblano peppers instead of sweet etc. It's near ASU so its got a little bit of that college vibe going on. BTW the salads are HUGE...a large would feed 4 guests. DO go if in the area!"}
{"text":"I am a NY pizza guy but as far as Pizza goes in Phoenix this place is the best!  You need to get the Fried Raviolis and the Wings are good too! They even offer Good Blue Cheese which is the right way to eat wings (sorry all of you West Coasters but Ranch isn't the original)"}
{"text":"The place has a fantastic atmosphere and the waiters are very engaging each time I go. The food is good although the pizza can get a bit salty by the time you are done. Just try, you will know what I mean after you eat it. I would definitely recommend the pizza pies and boom dip. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I usually dine in and this has not happened to me before. My Co worker placed an order for pick up. 45 min later food was ready (he ordered deep dish pizza thats why it took longer than usual) He picks up food and gives me my order. 

I'm super excited and starving, pasta was on point delicious as always! But all 3 of my garlic  breads were burnt! Not good at all, it's not like they didn't have time to replace them. I ate 1/2 of one and the rest of them are going in the trash! :/ 

I'm irritated and annoyed because whoever was in charge of the garlic bread should've known it was burnt and should have replaced it. I think that since it was a Carry  out they figured, the hell with it! Chances are they will not be returned to the kitchen! 

If you are carry out I strongly  Recommend you check all of your food. Make sure you are not given burnt bread! :/"}
{"text":"All the locals love this place.expect a wait. I ordered a glass of wine and the lady asked for my id. I was surprised. I resisted the strong urge to say \"lady, are you effing blind?\" And instead handed her my license. She looked at it and then said \"oh, wow.....you look great!\" So naturally  I think this is the most fabulous restaurant in the he world. But the pizza was very salty. Tasty, but salty. Later that day I joined a convention of senior citizens for happy hour and oregonos was mentioned.  We all unanimously agreed that the pizza is in fact very salty."}
{"text":"Took over an hour and a half to be Sat. 15 min for drinks and forever for crappy \"Chicago\" style pizza.  Question.. I grew up in Chicago and I have never had cheese filled crust"}
{"text":"Went here several months ago when visiting the Phoenix area. 

They have a beautiful outdoor patio where you can enjoy some delicious pizza. I really loved the great sense of humor and laid back attitude the staff had. We ordered A Heck of a Slice and a Bollo Pasta with Sausage. Yum City!!

The food was so good, I wish there was one in LA, but in the end we settled with an Oregano's T-shirt \"Menu Can Trust\"  to remember our great experience."}
{"text":"Great food with huge portions for takeout. The family enjoyed the entrees and we have since ordered again several times. Hard to find Chicago-style pizza outside of chugs O and this place did not disappoint. The menu has enough to offer for everyone to find a unique and delicious meal while still maintaining its Italian/Mexican flair. We are happy to have a great takeout or dine in restaurant so close to our new home! Prices were reasonable to the portion sizes, if anything we felt like we got more than our money's worth."}
{"text":"I don't quite get the popularity of this place. I mean, the pizza's alright, the atmosphere okay. But geez, it seems like ask any ASU student where to eat and they get stars in their eyes as they talk about \"Oregano's.\" It seems to be on everyone's favs on their Facebook pages. 

So, I guess it would be hard to live up to the hype.  Honestly, for my money, there's far better (and cheaper) pizza in Tempe just up the street and there's not a 20-30 minute wait nor any hype. The pizza's fine here, but nothing spectacular. Same with the pasta dishes. The waiters kinda annoy me with their buddy-buddy schtick, \"Hey, good job bra, you finished that huge pie.\" I feel like I'm five.  

I dunno. I feel so awkward eating at a place where it seems everyone else is just so excited to be there, and I just don't understand."}
{"text":"Well.... We love this atmosphere -we like walking up here for some wine but really have to consider if this is where we want to eat because of the way they ring up gluten free pizza.  Barrows has the better deal and the better pizza. Oreganos GF pizza not comparable to any other restaurants whatsoever.   Yes, GF pizzas are always smaller which is to be expected. Oreganos bases the price on that of a bigger pizza plus a \"build your own\" platform on top of that --costing you upwards of $30 for a 10\" pizza ( which for some;  is personal size ).  They should allow you to order the same pizza as any other one on the menu (which reach up to 22\") and upcharge the crust only -  instead of begin from scratch with an overpriced GF crust and rack up toppings until you have a $30-$35   ......  10\" pizza in front of you."}
{"text":"We will never be back to this place.  After a horrible first experience there, we finally decided to try it again.  First they called us in for our table only to tell us they gave it away because we were \"late\".. which we were not.  They then told us we were next.. after which they seated 2 parties our size in front of us.  When I asked why they did that when we were next, the red headed hostess got nasty with me and explained that we were in fact NOT next but could not explain why we were told we were.. the manager was MIA while we watched it take them 17 mins to bus a table that would have worked for us and seat some one else again in front of us.. finally when the manager appeared to hear my complaints he only apologized and said he would do things better next time..  there will not be a next time.  If your going to go there, be nice to the red head or she will basically not seat you, and don't expect the manager to do anything like.. manage.."}
{"text":"We go there all the time when we have company over. The wait is normally pretty long, sometimes an hour, but you can't blame a restaurant for that at all. Normally we get one of the deep dish pizzas on the menu, but last time we did a build-your-own pizza, and it was amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant, and I also recommend ordering your pizza over the phone about 20 minutes before you arrive because deep dish takes a while to make. Overall great experience every time I go. 10/10, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not that Oregano's really NEEDS yet another glowing review, but here it is:  

Yum.  :)"}
{"text":"Not a fan at all! I've been here twice and both have been a negative experience. The first occasion I ordered a salad which didn't settle to well with me. The second time I got a salty pizza. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong thing or maybe Oregano's and I aren't a match. Also on the second occasion the service was not up to par. MAYBE I'll give it another shot?"}
{"text":"it was crowded for sure and they could use more space, but i really liked the food. also we got lucky and were sitting next to a pleasant couple  b/c u r sitting on top of the ppl next to u, so u better like em. i had a giant delicious chocolate chip pizza thing for dessert and we had huge salads and pizzas-talk about portion sizes. the pizzas have interesting and yummy toppings on them. i would come back here."}
{"text":"Super yummy food and huge portions! Staff is always friendly and very accommodating. Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Oregano's, you are vile, and I am baffled by your crowds of followers who seem willing to loiter about in 115 degree heat for over an hour for you. Everything tastes as if someone had an accident with the salt shaker in the kitchen. Bland, boring, and dehydrating. No thanks."}
{"text":"Awesome pan pizza. This is the real Chicago style stuff. It took 45 minutes to bake, but worth the wait. My wife had a salad, which was HUGE.  I'd definitely return again."}
{"text":"Didn't try the pizza but the pasta was delicious. I got the plate-sized ravioli, yummm! The pizza cookie dessert was one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. Makes me wish I lived in Arizona."}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant meatballs and Italian sausage I have ever eaten.  My girlfriend and I ate, or should I say gorged ourselves, here for lunch.  The pizza was also very good and was even better the next day cold.  Service was a bit slow and they kept for getting things or else I would have given this place 5 stars their delicious food deserves."}
{"text":"Tried it twice. Dine-in and take out. Both times we were disappointed. I'm Italian and this place is not an Italian food. If the locals think this is good, they need to get out and travel more. Its not. I've had better frozen before and Safeway has better chicken. 

If you want good pizza try Barrows Pizza or US Pizza."}
{"text":"My Family and I have tried to eat here 2x in the past week, but unfortunately not been able to due to the growing arrogance of this establishment have not been able too.  Yes your pizza and apps are good, but at the end of the day this is just pizza and apps.  I can understand that a restaurant with a high demand especially in season can have an hour wait plus, but this even happened on a Wednesday.  Businesses need to adapt! If you are getting this crazy with wait times you need to have some sort of wait list!!! On the Wednesday time I called and asked to put our name on the list, said we we even on our way, we have 2 little kids that have a hard time waiting long periods, there was no help or confederations, by the time we got here (10 min later) they told us an hour and a half!!.  If this is your business policy fine, but again as a business YOU NEED TO ADAPT!!! or you WILL LOOSE costumers, I know you have lost us!"}
{"text":"Discovered Oregano's with daughter's first visit to ASU - went again while there for orientation 2 weeks ago. Delighted it is within walking distance when she starts school there this fall. Go Sum Devils!  We had pizza both times- deep dish and thin. Both were very tasty- love the tomato sauce! Nice salad. Enjoyed the outdoor seating, including outdoor heater in February and portable a/c in unseasonably hot April (maybe??). Yummy skillet cookie w ice cream too.

Really appreciate they give out water & little cheese pizza samples while wait for table. Highly recommend checking in on Yelp prior.  Only reason 4 star is both times our party of 2 seemed to wait much longer than larger tables in getting recognized by server. Actually flagged someone down after 10 mins to see if a server was assigned to our table"}
{"text":"Well, I went back to Oregano's today because I had a gift card and I am a sucker for free food. After my last experience, I decided to try different food. My friend and I arrived promptly at 11 and was immediately greeted by every employee. We started with the sweet potato fries. They were good, but the aoili was a little spicy and didn't really go well with the fries. Of course the best sweet potato fires are at Delux, but these were pretty good for a pizza joint. I got the stuffed pizza lunch special. It was good, too, but nothing to write home about. Then we got the best part of the meal: dessert. We ordered the cookie pizza thingie. It was great, it came out warm and gooey with vanilla ice cream on top. Overall, this experience was far better then my last visit to Oregano's. Would I eat there again? probably."}
{"text":"I would eat here every day if I could! The pizza here is incredibly delicious. We tried the pepperoni deep dish. It took about 35 minutes to reach our table, but the wait was definitely worth it. (The waitress advised that it may take up to an hour so the early arrival was a huge bonus!) Everything from the cheese, the sauce, and the crust was absolutely wonderful. During the wait, we had some of their meatballs as an appetizer. They weren't just your average meatballs either. These meatballs were so good that I could have had an entire meal off of them alone and have walked out fully satisfied. Whenever we eat pizza (at other places), I can usually polish off a few slices, but one slice of Oregano's deep dish pizza was certainly filling enough.  We ended up with a few days of leftover pizza, but that was of course a very good thing. Every employee here was very nice too (even the ones who weren't serving us.) For instance, on my way to the men's room, several employees said \"hello.\"

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a great italian meal and maybe a glass of wine or two, you cannot go wrong with Oregano's. Be prepared to wait for a table (it's a great restaurant!) but once you're inside, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

I've been to this location several times. Small and with limited parking (in the back), it can be a little crowded. But the atmosphere is wonderful! Fairly quiet but with a great energy, the vibe here is unlike any other.

The food is absolutely on point. I most recently ordered a pizza and we were not able to finish it between two people.

If you're in downtown Scottsdale and need to grab a bite to eat, don't pass up Oregano's. A bit on the upscale side, it's well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great pizza.  We were at this locations last night (Saturday), and the hostess not only made a pet friendly seat for us, but served us as well, (nicest server ever).  Overall very happy with the experience here."}
{"text":"It doesn't really matter which one of these you go to, ordering the whole menu is worth it. I always get the bruschetta because the ingredients are very fresh. My family has gotten the eggplant parmesan, the Italian sub 3 times, the sausage spaghetti, I can keep going. It is always packed, but there's always one more seat."}
{"text":"We love Oregano's on University and this location is shaping up to be spectacular, too."}
{"text":"we order a deep dish pizza with meat!  it was great and we couldn't finish it.  we also ordered a side of wings and they were good.  

i'm not sure what was going on but the night we went we had to wait about an hour to be seated.  this place was hopping and was real busy.

we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I could go on and on about this place. It is easily my favorite Italian/pizza restaurant in Arizona. I have been coming to this location and the location in Tempe for years. My favorite dish of theirs is the Pesto Penne bake with chicken, but you really can't go wrong. Their pan pizza is AWESOME and their thin crust is really good as well. There are even good things on their menu that you wouldn't expect to be good, such as the waffle fries and calamari. I think the only thing I wasn't impressed with was the one time I ordered one of their sandwiches. Anyways, if you're looking for a delicious Italian restaurant and you want to support Arizona business, I would absolutely recommend it. 

P.S. The wait times can be kind of long, so get their early or be prepared to sit for a little bit."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here for dinner one night and had a wonderful experience!  The prices are reasonable definitely for the amount of food you receive.  Our server Stephanie was very friendly and gave awesome service.  The artichoke dip was delish, as well as my salad and boyfriend got a sandwich.  Also  have had the pizza before is really good!"}
{"text":"Has Oreganos changed?  Our bruschetta seemed a little short on tomatoes and when we asked for some more, they said we would be charged for another full order of bruschetta.  We have been very loyal and regular customers but if they are now nickel and diming for everything, they'll go on the blacklist for sure.  There are too many other pizza options in town to put up with that.  The prices are high enough already."}
{"text":"We were thrilled when Oregano's opened a second Tempe location right around the corner from where we live! Their pizzas and salads are wonderfully fresh and flavorful. We have never tried the pasta...stuck on the great pizza. It is always crazy busy, no matter when you go, so just plan to hang out. Great for large groups and families too!"}
{"text":"I was working in town and gave this place a shot it was by far the best pizza I have ever  had if I get a chance to go back to AZ I will make sure to stop by again the beer was also cold and good prices  I wish they could deliver to San Diego only complaint"}
{"text":"There's a lot about this place that makes it really special, and for a chain restaurant that means a lot. I'll break it down Barney style.

Decor-- So there is inside and outside seating with some great decorations lining the walls, bathrooms, tables. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxed and I felt comfortable to a point. I sat inside and the booth is meant for the non-tall. 

Food- I got the unlimited bowl of pasta, and my god the portions are huge! I loved it! Angel hair pasta, meat sauce, and two giant sausages. By far some of the best food I've had in a while. The dessert cookie was amazing. We got half chocolate chip and half white chocolate macadamia nut with vanilla ice cream to top.... drooling

Service- The waiter and the rest of the staff were spot on. Very attention to detail, super friendly.


My only complaint is that, for me, the music was way too loud and I couldn't hear the person next to me talk. Besides that, I love it here. I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We came after a graduation, and I understand it was a busy day, however, you do not make your costumers wait for hours to get a table. Then, when we finally got in after 3 Hours, the service was slow and uncaring of our wait and made us wait even more. The food was not worth the wait, it did not taste fresh or even good at all. WORST SERVICE EVER. Please save your time and money and go elsewhere but please avoid this location, I will definetly not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! My husband and I came here on a Saturday night, we did not expect so many people, we were told an hour wait, so we decided to order a deep dish pizza to go. Waited for 1 hr, but worth it. Pizza itself was not perfect, but we think it's because we put too much vegetable there made it watery. Next time we would try more cheese and meat, should be better."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the pizza here being that I am from Chicago. If you're looking for a true authentic Chicago style thin crust pizza this is the place to go. The atmosphere is warm and eclectic, the staff is very attentive, and the pizza was awesome! I'll be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Went to oregano's for lunch today and lunch was great! But the employees did not realize that today was Veterans Day and the restaurant did not offer any sort of discount for our veterans as most of the restaurants are doing. Such a shame!"}
{"text":"This location is great! - yes I consider myself to be am oreganos pro. I've been to many! I live close to this location now, so this is the new regular.

The staff here at this location is great. The younger lady named Kayla at the pick up station especially! Of all the times I've been here, there was 1 hiccup. A couple of waiters were confused about which tables they were responsible for, and forgot about us for a little bit. They resolved this with a free cookie - which can literally make up for anything! 

Overall. Everything here is great. As long as the staff and food stay awesome...I'll forever be a customer to this location. 

Pasta 10/10
Pizza 8/10
Salad 9/10

And so much more to choose from."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to go. Especially, if I'm feeling pizza, pasta, or want a massive salad. The rumors are true, their portions are huge. Unless you're starving...you might want to opt into the smaller sizes of things; )

I usually go for dinner, but went out to lunch with a friend on this day. For pasta, the Big Rig w/ chicken is the way to go. I got their lunch size, and it was quite a perfect portion. I was perfectly full, and was actually able to still go back and put gym equipment together. 

Pizza : they are literally all great! I like the number uno though.

Pasta: Big Rig w/chicken. They also have sausage and meatballs as options. Big Rig has a chipolte base, so it's a little on the spicy size.

Salad : Pablo Picasso. The dressing is a little spicy as well for this one!

Also, their cheesy bread is great! But also filling! (Appetizer)"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best Italian restaurant that I have been to. It's the cutest little place with a great atmosphere. The staff was phenomenal. They were kind, seated us right away, and have great table service. 

The portions are HUGE! I only ate about 1/3 before I was full. It's without a doubt the most delicious I have ever eaten. 

I will definitely be back. 

P.s. The bazookies are fabulous."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place I was excited to finally get to eat here. Well, food took forever to come out. I got the Diablo shrimp, and while the sauce was really good, they had obviously not stirred the pasta enough because half of my noodles were stuck together in one big clump. The pizza was okay, but it was kind of soggy.

What really got me was when the waitress came while I was still eating (literally fork of food going in my mouth) to ask if I wanted the bill or to see the dessert menu and could she box that up for me. Really? I knew we had been there for awhile, but 30 mins of that 40 min timeline had been waiting for my food.

He says I'm being a bit harsh, but I guess it's because I had such high hopes. Given the lack of good eating on the west side, I was hoping to add this to the lineup. I'll give it a chance again in a month or so. Maybe they'll have worked out the kinks."}
{"text":"Here's what you do:

Guacatony
Maybe a little Caesar salad action (big portion will feed 2)
Alfredo the Dark
Chocolate Chip Pizza Cookie

Die."}
{"text":"It was a late night at work and my friend Danielle and I were super tired... The food was excellent especially the margherita pizza and appetizer! But what blew us away was our server \"Sean\" he was absolutely accommodating friendly and down right on top of everything and he was very friendly and enjoyed his company and most of all his remarkable service! The food is excellent! Thank you so much Sean! For making it such a great night!"}
{"text":"We tried the pizza at the Cave Creek location in May.  Very skimpy toppings, barely any cheese.  Not up to my experiences at the Scottsdale location.  Went back last night hoping it would be better and tried some pasta.  My husband had \"Alfredo the Dark\".  It was a pile of pasta with a little cheese sprinkled in it.  He ordered it with \"sausage\" thinking he would have sausage in the pasta.  No- it came out with two big links that looked like kielbasa and it was too spicy to eat.  Don't know why they call it \"Alfredo\" - there was barely anything on the pasta.  I think he ate a few bites and gave up.  I ordered Big Rig Pasta and asked the server how spicy it was.  She said that she didn't like spicy food but loves it and that it wasn't too spicy for her so I gave it a try.  Of course it was much too spicy.
Bottom line- not worth the wait and the food is not what I would describe as Italian.  Don't know who's in the kitchen but they need to improve of those crowds waiting outside will find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"Fun family spot.   I wouldn't come here on a date or for a business meal, but it's a solid choice to take the kids.   (My teenage stepson choose this as his birthday meal every year.)

You get massive amounts of food and a fun atmosphere.   I shudder to think of the calorie count, but portions are definitely meant for sharing.

 Our server last night, Josh, was exceptional.   After a lengthy wait for a table (a very common experience....you'll probably wait around an hour), we were running late for a movie.  Josh did a great job of making sure we were out on time; he was prompt, professional, and personal."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent service. So many restaurants have struggled in this location, I hope Orgeganos makes it. Dave took great care of us. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Connor has been our server the past few times, and she's amazing! She's very attentive and sweet, and is very well informed about the food.
Amazing service and great food!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken lasagna which I enjoyed previously except this time the chicken was gray and did not appear appetizing at all. I've been disappointed with this location in the past as well. 

Service was good, not great.  

They always make you wait when you can clearly see open tables."}
{"text":"Had the margarita thin crust pizza for dinner.  It was average.  The beer was very cold!  The place was very cool the way it was decorated.  Will try again for lunch."}
{"text":"NOTE TO NEWBIES WHO WANT TO EAT AT OLD TOWN GILBERT:
1- go because you're a trendy hipster who likes waiting 1-2 hours to eat
2- eat at 8:00 pm otherwise you'll wait 1-2 hrs 
3- go when its 115 degrees and you might wait 45 minutes
4- go during the week at 8pm when its 115 degrees for the shortest wait time.
5- snowbird season takes this wait to new heights!! BEWARE ON ANY DAY OF THE WEEK!

Cheap tastey italian food. Watch out for some of their sauces.....they are killed with garlic and basil and can be a bit spicey.
But....where the heck can you get a large bowl of pasta for 8.99 and scampi for 
13.99 ?? NOWHERE! Thats why people wait for 1-2 hrs to eat there.

Not sure when i'll go there again simply because of the insane wait times.
I'd love to try joride taco's next door but that was a 2 hr wait.
Postino ?? 1 hr wait

Trendy sux .....head elsewhere if you're actually hungry !  :)"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill in the past couple of years. Corporate has changed the quality of their pasta in order to save money. The only thing that really tasted good was the cheese bread. I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Pretty delish!  Only downside is there is ALWAYS a long wait and not all the waiters/waitress are very attentive."}
{"text":"Here's how a recent lunch date went down*

Hungry Friend: OMG Hay let's have lunch!
Me: Ok! Where? 
HF: Oregano's!!1! 
Me: Ok! 
**drives to Oregano's lawl.**
Me on Phone to HF: Hi, I'll be there shortly. I had to park 53 blocks away.
HF: Pwned! 

Oregano's is awesome. Try the Boom Dip (Spinach Artichoke Cheese Dip) and tell me otherwise. The Meatball Sandwich? Takes a couple of days to eat it all. Delicious pizzas, salads bigger than your freakin' HEAD. You can't really go wrong. If you order one of their Cosmopolitans, bear in mind that they will only serve you 2 due to their potent nature. (I'm not sure if this is some sort of Urban Myth, but I heard it from this guy that my friend knows)

As illustrated in my little playlet above, the only bad thing I can say about Oregano's is that the parking situation... how to put this kindly... sucks. Tow away signs from neighboring businesses abound. The last time I went, I literally had to park 2 blocks north of the restaurant and hoof it for a while. At least I had some sort of activity to work up my appetite.

If you go on the weekends, prepare for about an hour wait during dinner hours. You may also want to arrange for a shuttle to and from your vehicle, wherever you may wind up parking.




*This may or may not have actually happened."}
{"text":"I had high expectations since everybody at work told me about how great Oregano's was. It was my first time there and service was real slow, my family and I ordered pizza, pasta and wings (that took like 40 min to arrive). 

The staff was friendly and corteous, they would check on us every now and then, but when my plate came in (Alfredo the Dark) which I ordered without meat, it came with 2 meatballs, I told my server and she took cake of it, I was really hungry by that time and when i tasted my pasta it was so flavorless and plain, apart from being cold. It was dissapointing because I read this delicious description on the menu.

Pizza and wings where delicious tho, and so the cookie pizza my niece got for her Bday! Might try again someday."}
{"text":"We come here often! Who doesn't love a great pizza cookie, OMG the stuffed pizza is TO DIE FOR (if you have an hour to wait, or call it in!) Andrea is our favorite server as well!! I highly recommend calling the food in, sometimes the wait can be long otherwise!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat but .......today this server is not very good he is nice enough but i asked for side of extra sauce and 20 min later he asked if i got it another 15 min later still no sauce food is cold i shouldhave ate outside with the bartender i knew ......then with no sauce in hand he boxes my food which i had barley eaten and charged me for the sauce ive never recieved...:("}
{"text":"We normally eat in the bar, in fact it feels like a second home. We eat there not because of the drinks, but because two bartenders, Kelly and Courtney have given us fast, friendly, and accurate service every single time. They remember our names, and our order is always perfect. Thanks, gals!"}
{"text":"In love with Oreganos. Like...in love. 

Here's a little tip though...figure out what kind of pizza you want BEFORE you arrive so that you can order it when you sit down. Their pizzas can take anywhere from 25-40 minutes to cook, so you don't want to be starving yourself, smelling all the Oreganos goodness, feeling tortured with every table that gets their delicious smelling pizza before you. 

Trust me.

Also, save room for pizookie. It's a skillet baked cookie that's just every so slightly underdone so that it's soft and gooey...and then they top it with ice cream. Can you say heaven in a skillet?? Try a half macadamia nut and half chocolate chip so you get the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Maybe it's what we ordered..... But I don't know. This was a huge miss on our part. We unintentionally ordered meat-free stuff and were very sorely disappointed.

Is the meat where the flavor is?? I guess so.

Hubby was so turned off we won't return together. 

The pesto was good but our pizza and salad were very very bland"}
{"text":"Let me break it down. Let. Me. Break. It. Down. Happiness = Oregano's pizza cookie. 

I'm being totally honest here, this is my favorite dessert in the entire world. There is something about 1/2 lb. of cookie dough baked in a deep dish pizza pan served warm and gooey, then topped with three scoops of vanilla ice cream. Nothing better. I think they recently started offering new flavor cookies (chocolate chip, peanut butter chocolate chip, and white chocolate macadamia nut) PLUS they allow you to do halves of two different kinds. 

I went twice when I was in town for a week, once for regular dinner date and the other time for my birthday celebration after a nice dinner...as in we left the fancy restaurant and came here just for the dessert. This might explain the few pounds I gained but it was worth every delicious calorie. 

As for the rest of the food, their pan pizza is really good. We built our own with sausage, green peppers, and sauteed onions. It took about 40 minutes for them to make, but it was no big deal since we were handsomely rewarded with a delicious meal. Our waitress was super nice and came back a few times to check on us and get drink refills. The wait here is always crazy long (around 30-90 minutes) but I say stick it out...or go eat at the bar."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian delicacies at a very affordable price. Plus, all the staff is down to earth; very courteous and always wear a smile. Also, generous in portions."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start with Oregano's. I'm used to receiving good service, but this place went above and beyond to make me feel important, even when the place is packed on a Friday night. Moving my order up the queue so it would be done sooner, accompanying me to the area where the pick-up was (I was a newcomer), and then being almost the friendliest servers I've ever dealt with (seriously). That isn't even mentioning the pizza, which was by far the best I've had since moving here and is a close second to Brooklyn Pizza in New York. We tried Rossati's a couple of weeks before, and Oregano's blew them away. Amazing pizza, great service, and a price that is comparable to any pizza joint in town."}
{"text":"Great Italian place for the price.  I had their BiGRiG pasta bowl with wheat rigatoni, the consistency of the pasta and flavor of the sauce were pretty good but I still had to flavor it up with spice and herbs, not what I was expecting for something that says it was supposedly to be spicy.  I ordered a side sausage and must say it was the highlight of the entree, perfectly crisp outside and superb flavor.

A good place if in the area for Italian food but I wouldn't say somewhere that one would go out of their way for, chain restaraunts usually aren't."}
{"text":"So I really love this place and have for a long time! There are so many different items on the menu that I like to order. Among them are the Vino Bambino Salad, the wings(hot and gold mix), Big Rig Pasta with angel hair pasta, and the Bellini. These are my favorites! The pizza and sandwiches are also good and the pizza cookie is a favorite among kids! The service has always been great. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"It seems like it was just yesterday, but it was more like 25, or 26 years ago when I first stepped foot inside what was once called Lawrence of Oreganos! It was opening day then and the next few weeks tables were easy to garner but that changed, as \"Oregano's\" started to earn its place in the future history of famous Arizona Restaurants. It began to get tougher and tougher to get a table even as we watched this tiny Bistro expand to a mini compound, and soon to be pretty a darn successful regional chain.

Although I have enjoyed hundreds of meals with friends and family during the last 3 decades, and waited as many hours for a table, it has been years since I have been in. That changed last night and although tradition was shattered, I was stoked to be immediately whisked to a big table in the corner with NO WAIT! 

So on to last nights visit, I first notice that the dining experience starts in the driveway, the building looks great, and music was in the air. upon entering our greeting was welcoming and efficient. The walk through the dining room was fun, and although a little Disneyesque, it felt like we were entering and old time, big city Italian restaurant, It's pretty, vibrant and smelt delicious.

We were lead to a great big table in the corner and menus placed for us so we could sit and stare at the wall, we took the initiative to scoot around to the back so we could people watch and take in this neat space and vibrant energy. Soon into dinner and coincidentally good friends were seated across from us. That was nice, and its casual enough that standing and talking for a few minutes wasn't a problem for this casual environment.

My buddy said \"wings\" I got this, I said... Italian Gold with a side of the hot sauce were ordered with our beverages. The wings arrived late, after the sandwiches, but they still tasted EXACTLY as I remembered. Delicious. I snuck the order in with beverages cause I knew they took a while. I would have loved to start with them rather then eat along side of entrées. Although blamed on long cooking times ( I knew that) this was the only service mis-step. The rest of our service was so good that we left a fat tip for our friendly server.

Overall everything we ordered was delicious, and prepared well, with the exception of the Cole slaw and Giardinara that came with our sandwiches. The slaw was so finely chopped I thought it was Ice berg lettuce. It was Ice cold and had a unique flavor and I ate it all, it was a more visual and textural thing, and the Giardinara may have been from the bottom of the barrel or just not as I remembered, It was all okra and peppers, just all dark green, Not really a problem just not great. It was especially nice to see that prices are still very reasonable and portions every bit as big as always.

I am not sure why it's been so long since I have been, but It wont be long, till I get back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 6 stars! Excellent staff and even better food. We get the Vino Bambino with every meal... I have to say, there is not a thing on the menu that isn't delicious."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is regarding this place, I've had much better. My husband and I had heard wonderful things about Oregano's throughout the years (we've lived in Phoenix 22 years) and decided we had to finally try Oregano's Pizza. We pride ourselves on being \"foodies\" and our moto is you have to give a place at least three trys. Our order consisted of a Greek Salad, one thin crust pizza and one deep dish pizza. The salad was ok, nothing memorable, but not too bad. The deep dish was fair, could have used more cheese but did have a good buttery flavor in the crust. The thin crust, however, was a disaster. It was like eating cardboard. Tough, chewy and flavorless. I think I'm still trying to digest it.   I won't be able to stick to my \"three try rule\"  at this place.  If you're craving a good pizza try Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Oregano's in general. This location wasn't bad. Great service and good food. The wait for a table was ridiculously long."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Service not so great, but hey it's a pizza joint rrright! Thin crust pizza is as good as any I've ever had, pick your flavor."}
{"text":"Loved it! Wait wasn't too bad. We checked in online and saved some time by doing so. We had a meatball sub, Calamari, Lady is a Scampi dish. Everything came out quickly, and piping hot. It is always one of our favorite places to visit. Waitress was attentive and hospitable. All of the staff was cheerful and greeted us as they walked by. Only reason I did not give 5 stars is because bathrooms could use a little TLC, they smelled as if they were mopped by dirty mop water. Easy fix and I'm looking forward to our next visit. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We arrive a waiter takes our drink order. Then informs us. There is a shift change. As we wait for this (2)min change they keep seating ppl around us. Ignore us as they take everyone else drink order and food order. Before us even tho they arrived way way after. We waited about 20 min so finally ask for a check. 
Do not come here."}
{"text":"My family and I had a really great experience at Oreganos. My niece and nephew were in town, and my sister (who used to live in Scottsdale) insisted we take them here. I now understand why!

The pizza is so good. I recommend thin crust but they also do pan. Don't overlook the appetizers, though. We had the spinach artichoke dip and it was excellent. Maybe not quite enough for 5 people, so if you've got a large group, be sure to order 2. We had the cookie and ice cream for dessert - phenomenal! Like the dip, order 2 if you've got a party of 5 or more. 

Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The atmosphere is fun and kid friendly. I highly recommend Oreganos for a positive family experience!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from this location last week as a to go order and the woman, Lauren, who took my order was outstanding! I typically expect decently kind service anywhere I go but she went above and beyond, to the point where I needed to write this review! She was very nice and genuine to talk to and made sure my order was 100% correct and when my husband picked up the food, everything was cooked perfectly and everything was there and SO delicious! When I call again and make a to go order, I will definitely be asking if she is available to talk to! She was great!"}
{"text":"Incredible pizza! We ordered the thin meat pizza and it was to die for. I liked it even better than the delicious Chicago Deep Dish we got (which is saying something for this crust and cheese lover!) We will definitely be back to an Oregano's location next time we visit Phoenix. The ambiance was charming and warm."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and the pizza is sooo good. Thankfully they serve lodi wines. Had to get the michael David seven deadly glass.  We ordered the combination pizza. Delish!!!! We will be back again soon. Great place to stop into on the way to Scottsdale from the airport."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I have been coming here for years. They also have great service. The only thing is that they don' take reservations. It is a first come, first serve basis and that can sometimes be a pain. However, their food makes up for it :)"}
{"text":"The go-to place in Scottsdale, AZ for pizza. I absolutely love this place for their awesome delicious pizza as well as the scenery (it has a cool retro/Italy/pizzeria feel). I've brought my in-laws here for dinner and they are addicted just as I am. Service has always been good. The best items on the menu is the dirty monkey cocktail, Pablo Picasso Salad and the thin crust pizza! Yummm"}
{"text":"Wow!

This is an amazing place. I don't normally speak highly about chain restaurants but this is the exception to the rule. We had the kick butt Garlic bread, Lawrence's Original medium thin crust pizza, and an Oreganos Favorite salad.

The salad and the garlic bread was amazing but by far my favorite item was the pizza. Friends be warned, one can scarf a whole pizza: no problem! It's that good and that easy to eat.

Will definitely be back to go through the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"In the last year our experiences here have been SO much better. Maybe it's because we've stopped ordering take out from the untrained teens at the host stand and sitting on the patio where you're ignored for an hour. We've stuck to the bar and been happy campers ever since."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with friends!! Awesome parking lot. Have yet to see inside, wait is usually pretty hefty. Hefty hefty hefty (anybody remember the Glade commercial)? Anyway, I'll let you know how the pazooki is. Ttyl."}
{"text":"ALWAYS a great experience. Great servers, great food, and a great environment. I've only had a case of one waiter who wasn't very good, but the other many times that I've been there make up for it. I've been to other Oregano's and this location is by far my favorite. I love the feel of walking into Italian homes, feeling at home."}
{"text":"After living here for 25 years, I finally got around to trying Oregano's. After so much build up, it was honestly a huge let down. I admit, I didn't order any pizza, so if that's what you should go there for, I'll have to make another visit.

But I've heard good things about their food in general and I was completely unimpressed. I ordered the beefstro salad with a \"LARGE\" amount of shaved rib-eye. There was nothing of the sort. Yeah, there was meat, but let's not go overboard by saying a LARGE amount in all caps. It was mediocre at best. Plus, my boyfriend's meatball sandwich came out literally 10 minutes before my food. He was almost done when I got my meal. That's a huge no-no at a restaurant. I was extremely annoyed. His meatball sandwich was nothing special. Seems no restaurant makes legit meatballs, just some canned bullshit that tastes generic. To top it all off, when my boyfriend was offered sweet potato fries or waffle fries, the server failed to tell him it was a $1 more for sweet potato fries. I guess it's on the menu, but if you're going to make it sound like it's an equivalent choice of sides, how should we know? You have to make that clear when offering. Duh.

The server was friendly and the overall atmosphere seemed nice, but that was a fairly lame experience. I doubt I'll even go back to give the pizza a try, too many delicious pizza places around to waste my time."}
{"text":"Good pizzas, good salads, but frequently very long wait times. Otherwise I would give it four stars."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to come out to dinner here tonight. It was my first visit to Oregano's. I had been warned by many of my friends that there are long wait times. First off, I would like to say that the service was outstanding from hostess to server to food runner. We arrived a little before 5:00 and were told it was an hour wait. As we waited outside, we had a gentleman ask if we would like any beverages while we waited. We were seated around 5:50. Marvin was our server and he was excellent! He is very outgoing and kept our drinks full. Great experience, it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"The wait is averages about 30-45 minutes for a table. The drinks are decent. My favorite dessert is the pizza cookie although it is roughly 1400 calories, it's nice to share with a friend or date."}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  We ordered pizza, cheese bread, and pasta bread bowl.  All of it was amazing though my favorite part was the cheese bread."}
{"text":"Visited our local Oregano's in Cave Creek the other night for the first time! What a treat! The Kale Salad is amazing! It's huge, and 3 Ladies split it and were not left lacking for more. Also, thoroughly the enjoyed the Italian Flag Lasagna. It's a meat lover's \"died and gone to heaven\" dish! No wonder there's always a line out the door on the weekends! Checking in on Yelp before we left home definitely made our wait time shorter!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the weather outside today and sat outside on the fake grass patio for lunch. I ordered the Oreganos fav Jr salad and the sausage pesto pizza, I did however manage to convince myself that I was too fat for a pizzookie(though I don't recommend you talk yourself out of it...I've been regretting since I left!)
The salad was amazing like always. This particular pizza I tried for the first time! I loved the sausage, very full of flavor but could have had a few more on it. The tomatoes were good as well. But the pesto sauce...kind of lacking. Not too flavorful, couldn't really tell it was there. But I am never disappointed by the tomato sauce pizzas...do try. This location is great to visit because they are usually not \"as\" busy as the other locations."}
{"text":"We visit here regularly! The stuffed pizza is a must have. It does take about 50 minutes to make so if you're hungry and there's a wait you can order it before you get to the table with the hostess. We got calamari as an appetizer which is delicious. All of their pastas are also great. My families favorite is the ziti. If you are in the mood for a cocktail, they have a variety of original house drinks. The root beer float drink is tasty! They also have a banquet room if you are interested in hosting an event here. My fiancé and I will be having our rehearsal dinner here in April. The only downfall about this location is that the parking can be a challenge. Downtown Gilbert can be busy in the evenings which leads to having trouble parking and long wait times at the restaurants. But it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"So far, I've went here to pick up their two sliced pizza lunch special. As much as I would like to review this place a bit more thoroughly (customer service, dine-in experience, facilities, etc). My overly satisfied taste buds wanted to go ahead and rate them now!

Their pizza is really, really good. I'm a die hard pizza lover, and I have had my fair share of assorted pizzas, from frozen to fast food chains, to actual gourmet pizzas at restaurants.

All I can say is, Oregano's pizza is on a class of it's own. And for me, that's very important with pizza; to have their own distinct flavor. It's so good in fact, that even if someone gave me pizza in an unmarked box, I would be able to tell it's Oregano's.

Now, I am no food critic. But their pizza makes me want to be one; Just for the moment at least.

Their bread and crust is nice, thin, crunchy, and flaky at just the right level. You can also taste the creaminess of the mozzarella cheese, with the impact of that deli-licious pepperoni slices. And the best part is, the marinara sauce isn't drenched and is \" volume\"d out perfectly.

If it comes to the pizza I have no complaints. I would really look forward to getting a chance to dine-in and try their pastas.

Kudos Oregano's"}
{"text":"I can safely say that Oreganos has the best stuffed pizza in the state of Arizona. It takes about 45 minutes to bake, so on top of the general 20-60 minute wait for a table... just make sure you come on a night you have plenty of time and are in the mood for a good time. While you wait, there is a full bar with staff that will be happy to greet you and offer a drink. 

The location isn't huge, almost 40% of the seating is available on their patio (along with a second, much smaller, outdoor bar)."}
{"text":"This is our go to Italian restaurant! The food is absolutely delicious, my favorite is the penne pasta bread bowl. We have liked everything my family has tried on the menu from pasta to Pizza, and feel the prices are fair for the large portion size. One meal lasts me two days! It is very family friendly with a fun, carefree atmosphere, and my kids love playing with the ball of pizza dough they are offered. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a casual, family friendly restaurant with great service."}
{"text":"We love Oregano's!  It's always a fun atmosphere, and the food is always on point!  Something for everyone.  It would be nice to not have to wait 2 hours on the weekend- but I can understand why they are so busy.  Just wish reservations were still a thing.  Dessert cookie is so GOOD-join the birthday club (they have a specific name for it) and get a free one on your special day."}
{"text":"Good pizza loved the guac appetizer. Very large amount of guac and at least 14\" parm pizza with it. Had local beer on tap. Ate outside and had heaters. Nice place for families or after work."}
{"text":"It was pretty good! The staff were awesome! I have been to several oregano's here in the valley and this place tops my gratitude for real flare fresh was our waitress and she got everything as expected and wanted and then some! Constantly checking on us to make sure we were good serving our pie when most people don't do that. The food  is always good!"}
{"text":"Ok so from being from San Diego I just moved out to Scottsdale a few weeks ago and have been looking for great Chicago style pizza. I had been told about a few places and I finally tried Oreganos and its the best thin crust pizza in AZ. Both of my parents were born and raised in Chicago so I have known what great pizza is from them.

I got a sausage and green pepper thin crust pizza and it was perfect. I was also told by the host on the phone that the wings are really good so I got some Italian gold wings and they were very good too. Now I took it home so I didnt get any dessert but I hear the cookie with ice cream is amazing. 

I look forward to going again and make sure you go early and still plan on waiting haha. I called in my order on a friday night at 5:45 and it still took an hour but was well worth it and I will be back again and again. 

I told my parents about this place and they are excited to try it when they come visit at the end of the month. I look forward to trying other stuff as well. Also all of the stuff are super nice and everyone says hello and asks how you are doing. I love it. Go to this place ASAP and enjoy."}
{"text":"I didn't have a good experience at Oreganos. I came in with my boyfriend expecting good food since there is usually a line when we drive by, and I was really disappointed. We sat in the patio area where there were at least 40 flies buzzing around outside landing on customers and on the food. I couldn't even put my hands on the table because it was so sticky and gross. The silverware was also dirty. Our server was okay, she was nice but didn't put any extra effort into anything, even when she said goodbye she was already walking away before she finished and it wasn't even that busy. The food was okay and overpriced. The spinach/artichoke dip was good but the pasta (rigatoni) was awful. It had no meat in the sauce and tasted like it was prepared from the freezer, which wouldn't surprise me if it really was. The garlic bread was comparable to frozen garlic bread you can get from any grocery store and bake in the oven for five minutes. I made a comment to my boyfriend saying how the food wasn't good but it was fine for being cheap- but that was before I got the bill. I payed over $40 for my meal and felt totally ripped off. I don't understand why people review this place well and why there are ever lines outside of it. Maybe people just don't know better. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"First off this breaks my heart, but I'm finally fed up with this location...... I used to order weekly, and I would always ask for extra sauce for the diablo, and they would literally never give it too me.. sometimes it would have less sauce then a regular portion. The last straw was asking for el diablo chicken and then giving me shrimp... what if I was allergic....  Finally I decided to call tonight and tell them about the problems, and they didn't give two shits to what I said. I then proceeded to order; I get their and he girls super rude working the counter and didn't apologize for any of their mistakes.... I payed and left. But I will never go to any location ever again."}
{"text":"Let's start with the ice cold beer, had the stuff mushrooms which were excellent, the Clark Street and number one also very good , thin crust is the way to go, big beef and Cesar to go will have try later, Marvin our waiter very nice and friendly, be back soon."}
{"text":"Oregano's, Oregano's, what would we do without you? You are worth the long waits to get a table! You have hosted softball meetings in high school, family parties and 21st birthdays! I love you! 
Picasso salad and Italian gold wings are amongst my favorites. For not being big on pizza, I could probably eat half a large thin crust myself. With their ranch of course, so good. I have been here several dozen times, probably more than I should have! Food is always great and I have not ordered anything I have not enjoyed! Staff is always friendly, so friendly in fact I wanna smack one of the 10 people that will say bye to you as you leave this restaurant. Well worth it, and if you want to avoid the wait, take out is equally delicious!"}
{"text":"We love this place!! To keep it short for those of you that don't want to read on any further, my biggest complaint was waiting 40 minutes on 2 thin crust pizzas. Their deep dish says 40 minutes, so I'm confused as to why the thin took so long. The service aside from this was great!! 

Now to get down to the specifics! Their Bellini drink is amazing. It's strong, so I don't recommend if you're driving! They only will serve 2 of these per person because they are so strong. But it's like magic-you can't taste the alcohol! 

We LOVE their garlic bread. I think this stuff is gold-and it's only 5 dollars! Get a cheesy bread with marinara sauce-thank me later!! 

For our main course, my boyfriend got the numero uno- minus the mushroom and add shredded Cajun chicken. I had no idea about this, but you can substitute items for free on pizza. Even if it's substituting meat for a veggie! This blew my mind! I ordered a personalized pizza-thin crust with black olives, green olives, mushrooms, artichokes and roasted garlic (all things that my boyfriend hates). It was DELICIOUS. We recommend the fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top  

For dessert, you must do a pizookie. As a little tip, you can do half and half. My boyfriend and I always do half peanut butter, half white chocolate macadamia nut. And then commence fighting over the ice cream! 

You will leave here STUFFED and with leftovers. We spent about 90 bucks for everything and each had a meal for leftovers. Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  Everything I've had on the menu is amazing.  Pure genius.  I especially love their salads, the Big Beefstro and the Pablo Picasso.  Too bad they got rid of my favorite salad which was the spinach salad.  The pizza and pastas are also excellent.  Never had a bad food experience or heard any complaints from others.

The service is great, although we usually just order take-out for home or work.  It can get very busy (expect a wait, especially on weekends) and parking can be limited as the parking lot is shared with multiple asian food restaurants."}
{"text":"The service was great; a really kind staff. I also like the prices of the beer (3-5 bucks for a nice pint selection).  However, the deep dish pizza was not great. It tasted sour and had too much sauce, which overpowered the flavor of the cheese and other ingredients. Thus, the pizza was not memorable."}
{"text":"This review is for the location on Elliot only.  My husband and I visited and ordered the root beer float (there is alcohol in this) and a Diet Pepsi (seriously, Pepsi?  Get it together and put some Coke on the menu).  Root Beer Float was good, tasted like a root beer float, but managed to look like a glass of dirty milk.  Pepsi tasted like the fountain used water from the toilet.  

Dinner!  Yay!  Wait, noooooo.  Husband ordered the Chicken Parm and I ordered the stuffed rigatoni.  Both of these dishes came out with about a cup of fresh parsley sprinkled all over them.  Like the garnish, and literally a whole cup of it.  They also cut the stems up on it, but I'll get to that in a minute.  Lets start with the CHICKEN PARM.  First of all, it was a big breast of chicken, not a formed and processed patty of chicken asslips and beak.  The pasta with it was cooked only to the point of not crunchy.  And after the first bite my husband looked at me and said \"this tastes like they boiled the pasta in dirty water\".  I have to say, I don't think it was the pasta, I think it is their sauce.  My rigatoni tasted funny.  The ricotta inside was creamy and tasted good, but I couldn't put my finger on what tasted funny.  Then, just as I had figured it out, I felt something hard and crunchy in my mouth. A HARD AND CRUNCHYTHING IN MY RIGATONI?  Did I lose a tooth?  Was it a bug?  Oh, it was just a huge chunk of parsly stem.  There was so much of this crunchy parsley stem in the dish and the taste of the sauce was horrible, I couldn't eat it.  The manager came out (I hate when this happens, I'm not trying to get a free meal, I just don't like the food.  Get over it).  She offered to make us a pizza.  The Chicago Style I saw at the next table looked good, but I was told that takes 40-50 mintues to bake.  SIgh, we got a small cheese and pepperoni thin crust.  

The pizza came out and it was just cheese.  The server that brought it informed us that the pepperoni was under the cheese.  I ate a piece and again, their sauce tastes like it was made with dirty tomatos from the garden, not good.  My husband choked down a few pieces of this and managed to find a piece of pepperoni under all that cheese.

Needless to say, I was upset as this location was not even close to the location in Tempe, or Camelback.  We won't go back and urge you to drive the extra 10 minutes eat at another one of their locations."}
{"text":"Decided to dine here on National Pizza day. We sat at the patio bar. Daniel was our server and he was amazing. He answered all of our questions we had about the menu. We ended up getting their thin crust pizza. Which was awesome. He checked in on us a couple times and got us our refills before they were gone. Mike the manager also checked in on things and we noticed he was going around helping his staff with whatever they needed. We ended up learning that Daniel was short staffed in the bar which made him even more amazing because he tended to us in a very timely manner for handling everything on his own. I will definitely go back her again and request him as our server. Thanks Daniel!"}
{"text":"My family has made a goal to try something new here every time we come.  So far, that's been really easy.  They have so many #pizza options.  Great lunch specials.  And DELICIOUS pizza #cookies.  Good place just to come for #dessert.  Try the #fried zucchini, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Pricey but love their pizza they let you know the wait time which is nice and kept checking in on my group making sure we were well tended I rather enjoyed the atmosphere along with the service"}
{"text":"Impossible to place a phone order. 
I was put on hold 5 times in 9 minutes without being able to even speak. The lady that answered every time the phone automatically rerouted the call would put me on hold automatically. It's lunch time we are trying to order and get out not be put on hold."}
{"text":"I can only give this place 4 stars, because I am from the Chicago Area and I am proud to say that I am also an \"Official Chicago Pizza Snob!\"  Everyone knows the best pizza comes from Chicago (Be Quiet all you New Yorkers!!)  With that said, Oregano's does a good job at attempting to duplicate the Deep Dish Chicago Style Pizza.  The crust is not that of Gino's East in Chicago, but it's not a bad second.  I wish they offered shrimp on their pizza like Giodarno's in Chi-Town offers, but they do offer \"hatch green chilis\" (A total Southwest thang!)  Nevertheless, I like it and it's good for my Chicago Pizza Fix!!  :)"}
{"text":"This review is hard because the food is spectacular but the lack of parking and wait times make it not worth the time to go eat there. I have been to Oregano's about 3 times in my life because I avoid those two things unless I really want Oregano's food. The last time we went, it was 8:30 at night and our wait was still 20 minutes to be sat. Another 20 mins to get our food, so by the time we were done eating it was almost 10 o'clock at night. The prices were pretty crazy too. The food is really good though so a 3 star rating is pretty accurate."}
{"text":"THE BEST PIZZA in town. I get their thin crust pizza every time I go there but I have heard nothing but positive remarks about their pasta dishes too. They have a wide variety of toppings but the one thing not on their menu that you can request for is pepperocini. It is especially suitable if you are getting another meat topping, which I often get their sausage. 

In addition to their pizza, you have to at least try their pizza cookie ones. It is serve warm straight from the oven, just when the cookie tastes the best - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It is way too huge for one but if you are with a few good friends and don't mind digging into the same cookie, definitely get it!

I have experienced only great and friendly services there but there are times when the waiting can be a little too long. This is because it is close to the university and is often the celebration place so can be a little crowded. I recommend going a little earlier or later than the usual lunch or dinner crowd to avoid the long wait."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place! The service was great from the beginning to the end. Very friendly, courteous, and on top of it. 

The pizza was fantastic! Went with the thin crust 16\" with jalapeños, sausage, pepperoni, green pepper, and mushrooms. Paired with an ice cold Coors Light of course. Perfect sized pizza for 2-3 people. I would argue to say that this was a top 5 pizza for me! 

I'll definitely be returning to an Oreganos soon!"}
{"text":"I feel like people giving this place a tough time haven't had experience opening a new restaurant or the challenges associated with it.  Are there things that could be improved upon?  Of course.  However, each of the few times I've gone in and eaten at Oregano's it's been the same great food that I've come to enjoy at the other valley locations."}
{"text":"This place and location never fail! Always an enjoyable environment and the employees are on top of everything! And it's super cheap here, couldn't ask for a better deal (lunch is even cheaper) the pizza is exquisite"}
{"text":"So far my favorite pizza bistro! Love the music, the whole wheat pizza crust and the service. The main problem is that it gets really crowded Friday night. That's why I suggest to stop by any other day of the week and even try to make reservations if you are a group. I always sneak to the bar and enjoy the meal. 
Ingredients are really good in taste. I have tried also their salads and I'm waiting to try their pasta or other offers...but, any time we go, we end up always ordering a delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Once again this place hits right on the mark. It was a little busy, and we did have a bit of a wait. But I didn't care. Our service was fantastic, the manager came over several times to check on us too. The food was a little slow to come out, but my wife did order a pizza, and the appetizers we got held us over. Another fantastic dinner at one of our favorites! Thanks Oreganos!"}
{"text":"Well, the beer I had was warm, come to find out kegs are in the back of the building beer taps in the front.  Poor bar tender, we were his only table as he had to poor warm beer & service us.  Then the fruit flies, how do I know it's fruit flies well that's what I do for a living. No bus-person and all other service people rolling silver ware. \"Bad management\" deep dish pizza!   oil, oil but after :45min that oil's got to go somewhere. Maybe back maybe."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  Hands down best pizza in town.  Also amazing salads!!!  Service was top notch, Nicole had us laughing quite a bit, what a gem.  
I love this place and it's becoming a problem."}
{"text":"Always have to try the chocolate chip cookie desert!! To die for!!"}
{"text":"Went her for dinner last night! We had a couple issues with our food taking sooooo long. However, this place really knows how to make it right! Our server had a great personality and the manager took care of us. I understand things go wrong and that's okay. I appreciate how the manager took the time to clear up the issues with us and comped some of our meal,  because of this we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has been deteriorating over the past year.  It doesn't even seem Italian anymore.  The food is terrible and the service slow to very bad.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"A warm chocolate chip cookie doused in vanilla ice-cream just makes everything about life better."}
{"text":"Can you say discrimination? Why has Oregano's eluded the west valley??? We eat pizza too! I am a little miffed that you cannot find a good pie on the west-side. 

Peter bluck piper, pizza slut, domino no's, Pucky Johns and a string of mom and pops that make Tombstone look gourmet! Streets of New York used to be a good pie but they are slipping bad! We do have La Piazza Forno which is delish but they are hard to get into. 

Why I like the Oregano, I first came here on a blind date. Message, no matter how many times your friend says he would be perfect for you slap her face and run away! The best thing about this guy was that he suggested Oregano's for a Saturday lunch. I had never partaken in the deliciousness of Oregano's. 

He ordered basket of fries, UFOs (no longer on the menu), & a pepperoni pizza. Big guy this was appetizers! I tried the fries they were tasty, the UFOs I fell in love cheese stuffed artichokes dipped in batter and deep fried oh yeah baby! Sadly I must morn their departure. Then the pie yummy and I just love the square cut reminds me of home. Illinois! 

I had ordered the baked ziti one of my favs and now I don't recall his food order It was another kind of pasta. Let me just tell you the ziti was colossal! Humongous! I barely at a 4th of it, I see a doggy bag in my future. Not iron jaws geezus he ate a basket of fries, half a basket of UFO's and 3/4 of a Med Pepperoni pizza plus all of his pasta and the bread bowl! 

I was scared to get close I thought he might eat me! I love the Iced tea to it is china mist passion fruit and it's fantastic.

I will definitely be back, On a side bar I never order the deep dish on a dine in. The deep dish Stuffed One-O is fabulous, call ahead and get it togo. I usually call about 1 and a half hours before I want it and get it hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my mothers review who is not active yelper: 

Well all in my years of eating out (and trust me there are many) I have NEVER had such a terrible experience at a restaurant before. I will NEVER eat at Oregano's again. We went to the new one in Cave Creek with our friends, it was a 2 hour wait, so after a half hour we ordered to go but they said if our table opens up we can still sit. So our table opened before our food was done and the staff sat us, on the way we told her we had ordered from take out and she said no problem, well after we were seated the waiter told the manager and he came over and accused us of stealing a table, when we explained that we had been waiting on the wait list like everyone else and were seated by his staff, he rudely brought some of our food in the to-go boxes even though we asked for it to be un-boxed, when I asked about the rest of the food he made another rude comment, it was so obnoxious that a women from another table turned to us and said how RUDE this man was, that we would like to see another manager. It turns out the owner shows up at our table and asks if we would like him to call the police on us because we were swearing. We thought he was joking at first, but apparently the waiter told him we were swearing. Even the woman next to us was appalled! We got up and left. I said I will put it on social media he said go ahead we won't be the first (I can see why if that is how he treats his customers) He followed us to the car we did not want to talk to him, our friends stayed and explained, I think he was a little sorry when he heard the real story and not just the waiter who didn't want to serve someone who had ordered (which was stupid, he would have gotten a nice tip for doing half the work) Anyway the owner gave our friends a gift card, but too little too late. People skills might have served him much better. No loss didn't really care for the food anyway."}
{"text":"I love this Oreganos! Food is served hot and delicious, best pizza and pizzookie (pizza cookie). Mmmmm I always feel so welcomed and taken care of by the awesome staff, especially during my last visit. You must ask for Brianna! She is super sweet and attentive to detail. She will make you feel like family."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The wait to get in is always long but it is worth the wait.  The chicken wings are the best I've ever had.  The service was great and their pizza is also wonderful.  You have to try this restaurant if you haven't."}
{"text":"Location is sort of odd, but customer service and food is as good as any other oreganos. It's pretty cool how they split iit between two buildings with an outdoor seating in between."}
{"text":"Really fun and energetic atmosphere, friendly staff and great food. None of us at the table of five ordered pizza, all pasta dishes and we weren't disappointed. The sauces weren't overloaded, noodles were cooked properly and the chicken was well seasoned. 

All reasonably priced too. Will return to try their pizza!"}
{"text":"Nice enough outdoor patio and a friendly/attentive server made for a nice casual night out. Servings are huge so consider splitting salads and pasta. We had a large group and we were treated very well. Pleasant and attentive staff"}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with Oregano's.  Unless you want to watch a sports game, then you may be out of luck."}
{"text":"Good food and great pizza.  This location is new so the wait is still long....and it seems like it's all this time.  You won't go wrong here"}
{"text":"This is a good Italian place. Today I had what may be the best pasta dish I've ever had. It had artichokes and lots of different cheeses."}
{"text":"For three years I have been eating at different Oreganos restaurants around the valley. Bi go approximately 3 days a week to be exact.  Well today is the first time I have ever had to cancel an order.  It took them over 30minutes to make an antipasto salad.  Which I asked to be made without the cheese tons. Been they brought it out it in fact had them.  They said they would remove them and 15 minutes went buy and still no salad.  Being I had to return to work j asked to cancel the salad.  As we were getting ready to leave one hour after arriving they showed up with the salad that had been canceled and yes it still had the cheese tons on it.  I said no thank you to the gentleman and he in turn was very rude and stated loudly that all he wanted to do was take care of us and threw The salad across the bar to the trash.  I would have returned if he was not such an ass. Bee will not return to this establishment and I will tell our friends not to return as well!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Oreganos for years now.  Their food is delicious and above average Italian. Their salads are out of this world!  There Italian sausage is shipped in from Chicago where they have it made to their specific recipe.  I have not had a bad meal here!  There are locations around the valley however our favorite are in Mesa on Dobson and Southern and Bell and 67th Ave."}
{"text":"Oregano's is adorable. When the weather is nice there is nearly nothing better than sitting outside on the little patio with a glass of wine and a pie while Sinatra and Martin serenade you into a drunken bliss. While the menu isn't necessarily groundbreaking, it is mostly very tasty. Their pizza is always cooked well, melty and gooey without being burnt or too crisp. And they don't throw a ridiculous amount of sauce on it, just enough for a tangy bite to fight the creaminess of the cheese. Service is mostly top notch, though being in a college town like Tempe, they tend to have young servers and there can be an occasional miss. If my wife liked Oregano's as much as me, we would both be obese. I love visiting, the food is great, and they have the pazookie. PAZOOKIE. Four Stars."}
{"text":"I was dying for thin crust pizza and knew exactly where to go. Plus they have the best Ceasar Salad in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I ate at some really nice places in Phoenix/Scottsdale, but I am still fantasizing about Oregano's.  The pizza is perfect and the deep dish cookie is indulgent....ask for your cookie well done if you don't like it mooshie.  

Arizona- you are lucky to have this little gem!"}
{"text":"You have to try the garlic cheese bread ! Sooooooo Delish. I would have taken a pic, but We ate the whole thing before I could whip my phone out of my purse .. Just a warning , if you order a salad get the regular size .. Or be prepared to share (As if!!)  there are 2 other sizes you can order but be prepared to chow down on a Fred Flintstone portion of food ! My bf ordered chicken parm Sammy with fries and really liked it . The fries were waffle cut and seasoned , they looked amazing ."}
{"text":"Oregano's was recommended to me by one of my executives at work.  He described it as a cool, low key place with delicious food...after dining, I couldn't explain it better myself.  

We sat near the bar and David took care of us.  He was such a friendly person and went over and above to tell us about Oregano's and Arizona.  The backstory to Oregano's was really interesting and it was even more so in the way it was told with David's evident enthusiasm and passion for the company.  

I had the Zany Ziti and my husband had a pasta dish with sausage, jalapeños and poblanos (I can't remember the name of it).  Both were amazing with ridiculously sized portions.  It's pretty uncommon these days to find a place that doesn't give up quality when going for quantity in their dishes...Oregano's manages to do it!

To wrap up the night, we had the dessert with the chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream... mind blown.  It is a half baked warm cookie that aid complimented amazingly with the cold vanilla ice cream.  

If you are visiting Arizona, Oregano's is a must!!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Scottsdale, I have to stop in to Oregano's. Whenever I come in the service is wicked good! (Yes, I'm from the northeast!) Sometimes it can be difficult to get a seat, but usually I spend that time figuring out what I am going to try, or after talking with the hostess for a few minuets it usually never takes long to get a seat as they are very accommodating.  

The pizza is pretty good, tho there are also a ton of different options on the menu that are never less than amazing. Portions are always plentiful and almost too much sometimes. Not like that is a bad thing...

I would certainly suggest to anyone looking for a good bite in the area to stop in. I am so impressed with my numerous stops in that I even bought my fiancee one of their \"Legalize Marinara\" t-shirts!"}
{"text":"The worst service of all the restaurants I have been to. Manager has piss por attitude, then seats people before my party or 3 told me it might have missed us."}
{"text":"I called an placed a carry-out order and was told the order would be ready for pickup at 9:00pm

I arrived promptly at 9:00 pm and there were 3 employees working at the front end.  2 females who appeared to be hostesses and a gentleman.  The gentleman who greeted me told me he first needed to take a phone order before helping me. No problem I thought, having worked in the restaurant industry myself many years ago, I understand that one may be involved with handling many activities at the same time.
 
After completing the phone order which took about 5 minutes, the same gentleman told me he was going to go check on my order.  5-10 minutes later, I looked over at the bar and saw that he was mixing cocktails. A few minutes later he returned to the front counter, and instead of helping me, he proceeded to take another phone call, which lasted another 2-3 minutes.  

The last straw was that, after completing the 2nd phone call, which seemingly could have been answered by one of the 2 young ladies (hostesses?) , he reached down under the counter, and retrieved my order WHICH HAD BEEN THERE THE ENTIRE TIME.  

So I ended up waiting 20 MINUTES to pick up an order that was done at the time I had arrived.

I left feeling like I was treated less than a priority, and the end result was that my food was cold when I got home.  

We wont be back!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is good. Especially love Alfredo the dark with extra bread. The zucchini fries are so good."}
{"text":"Every time Steve comes to town he insists on going to Oregano's.  We really enjoy having lunch there together and of course he can't get Oregano's at home in Florida.
He always orders far too much food. 
It's always a good casual time for eating, drinking and laughing as we catch up.
I think everyone has heard of Oregano's, it's quite popular, but if you haven't you should go and experience it for yourself.  There can often be a wait so be patient."}
{"text":"Great service. Wonderfully friendly managers. Had Pablo Picasso salad and was very happy. No one person can eat a full size. A jr salad is huge!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times.. the first time eas ok, 2nd and 3rd ended up being in the bathroom after about 4 hours after dinner and into the following day! Not just me but also my friend.  
I've read other reviews of people getting sick too???
I eat out 3-4 times a week and never have this problem. 
Twice at the same resturant tells me something isn't right. 
Time to call Dirty Dinning on local news and have them check it out."}
{"text":"I love, love, love me some  Oregano's and I'm so glad I live just a few miles away. Their salads, their sandwiches, appetizers, pizzas and pizookie dessert are all amazing. Serious grub, very affordable, huge portions, a fun atmosphere, super friendly wait staff...this place has it all.

The only negative I have ever had is just a personal preference. If you are in a mellow mood or looking for something more romantic on a date night, this isn't the spot. It's LOUD and pretty cramped full of tables, people and antique 'stuff.' Fun if you are in a social mood and don't mind your personal space being invaded often."}
{"text":"My family and I were told that the wait was 45minuets -1hour it's been over an hour and there was an empty booth in the back, so I ask if we can have that booth and they said no because they were holding it for a party of 9 that came in after Us... But their policy says that they don't reserve tables? We also ordered our pizza so that when we sat down we can eat , our pizza was done and was going to get cold. We left in happy with this restaurant that has never happened to us before."}
{"text":"First off, let me say the staff are amazing. Friendly, fun, knowledgeable...overall just really great! The food, however...well, I find it all way too sweet. The salad dressing is sweet. The marinara is sweet. I don't know whose idea it was to make Italian food with sugar, but, to me, it's just not good. My husband's pasta was a little undercooked as well. Not the worst, but certainly not the best. Just kind of...meh."}
{"text":"had lunch here last Friday 3 people we ordered 2 orders of wings they took about 30 then they were room temperature I still ate them all because they were good but I mentioned it to the waitress and the manager came over and said he would take both wings off the bill that was way more then generous I will definitely come back I also tipped my server $15.00 on the remaining $6.00 bill she was great the kitchen screwed up. thanks to the manager great customer service"}
{"text":"Pablo Picasso Salad. Enough said.
But I'll go on....

Oregano's is awesome on so many levels: portion size, price, staff friendliness, menu offerings, locations, decor, etc. etc. etc.

I've been to Oregano's more times than I can remember and I seldom have anything to moan about except maybe the wait time...and not being able to decide what I want ;)

If you haven't been there, go.  If you're there for lunch, grab a pablo picasso salad and a passion fruit iced tea.  If you're there for dinner make sure you try the bellinis, the pesto bruscetta, the thin crust pizza...and again, the pablo picasso salad!!!!  

The music is fun, the decor is great, the staff is ALWAYS uber friendly.  The only gripes (other than what's mentioned above) is they should maybe invest in better silverware and outdoor furniture.  Other than that, keep doing what you do, Oregano's, and I'll keep adding to my waistline."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my sweetheart on the first Friday of opening.  It was packed.  The food was awesome.  The salad, the appetizer, and the main course which was pasta with parm was excellent.  And of course you cant leave without having a gooey cookie. Terrific!!!"}
{"text":"This is our \"go to place \" when vacationing in Scottsdale! We have been here 5 or 6 times over the past few years and have always had a great meal, great service and enjoyed the atmosphere, especially eating outside. The food is tremendous, we especially like the thin crust pizzas, salads and appetizers. Each visit we have a friendly server and an overall pleasant experience. A nice place to go after a fun day at a spring training game, round of golf or day exploring. Be prepared for a brief wait, but definitely worth the wait!

Our experiences this trip were not as good as we've experienced in the past. We had dinner there twice this trip with average results. The first night our pizza took an hour to be served. Once I saw larger parties getting their food before we did and they were seated after we were! I pointed this out to our server who then brought out our food, cold! It was too late and we were too tired and hungry to send it back. I think part of the problem is a different manager than the past few times we visited. Disappointed in our experience this trip."}
{"text":"Just ate here again last night and had the shrimp scampi pasta, which was impressive, but I did have to add salt. Something is just lacking here. Ambience and portions and quality of the food ingredients are all great, but the food just is missing some kind of splash of flavor that would make it different and/or better than I could make myself at home. The shrimp, however, were HUGE and the addition of cilantro in the dish added a nice twist."}
{"text":"These guys really know how things should be done.  I have eaten here regularly and can honestly say I have never left not 100% happy.  Awesome job Oregano's!"}
{"text":"Again!  Picked up dinner for the fam, the order wasn't what I had ordered due to usda restrictions on jalapenos.  It wasn't what I had ordered, and with out me complaining the manager came over and made it right.  This is why I continue to come here.  Good business is hard to find.  The only advice here is that if you have an issue with your meal, tell your server and they will fix it (based on my experience)"}
{"text":"Great casual spot with homestyle food. Truly a place where everyone feels right at home - from families, to couples on dates, to the lone diner."}
{"text":"I'm new to the Paradise Valley area so I thought I'd check out the stores & restaurants in the surrounding areas. Anyhow, I had a taste for pizza & stumbled across this gem. Had the Oregano's Favorite salad (BIG size, which actually feeds 2-3 ppl)...Apparently BIG is small there as they have an even BIGGER size!! We also ordered a Stuffed Spinach & Pepperoni Pizza (Chicago Style is what they call it). This pizza is stuffed with cheese & your favorite ingredients with a marinara on top! Suuuper good! Sauce is perfectly sweet w/ a bit of saltiness...can you say PERFECTION? Overall, I'm in love with this place now & will be back again & again!"}
{"text":"okay... don't get me wrong.. i love oreganos and come
once a week, and order the same thing. tonight i came
with some friends and our food came out and my chicken was served severely undercooked, still cold and pink in the middle. i told the server and asked to have it remade, and i didn't make a big deal out of it just because i know
it wasn't her fault and i work at a restaurant. but by the time the food came out everyone in my party was done which pretty much ruined the reason we all went out together.. in any other restaurant my food would of been taken care of. no manager ever came by, i paid full price for something that will probably give me food poisoning. awful management this sunday evening."}
{"text":"My favorite salad in the world, the Pablo Picasso, is here so I frequent Oregano's often. It's a family favorite, the kids especially love the experience. The music, the pizza dough, the exceptional staff, all of it is top notch. Oregano's does everything right. and we've sampled just about everything on the menu from the pastas to the pizzas and the salads. Two big thumbs up."}
{"text":"I am from out of state and had a friend recommend this place to me. It's okay. We got the Julius Caesar salad and a half mushroom half margarita pizza. Food was decent, wait was long to sit inside but we got seated immediately outside. Service was good. Nothing to ride home about. The uber driver that picked us up said we should've ate at the parlor, will be checking that place out next."}
{"text":"As a native Chicagoan, I can safely say that Oregano's is the best pizza in AZ - on-par with or better than most Chicago offerings.  Having been to (and impressed by) the University - Tempe restaurant, we thought we'd give this location a try.  Arrived at about 1 PM on a Saturday and there was a line . . . so we opted for the \"sit at the bar\" alternative.  The bartender was extremely pleasant - and that's what made up for her \"just OK\" service.  Food took a while to arrive - but, again, they were packed to the gills.  Meatballs with cheese and sauce were better than those at the University location.  Italian Gold wings were huge and delicious.  BBQ Chicken pizza (thin crust) was PHENOMENAL . . . better than any equivalents I've had in Chicago.  Sauce is top-notch and cheese is not greasy at all!  And the Chocolate Chip Cookie Pizza was delicious without question.  We had a very pleasant, delicious experience and will definitely be back.  One point:  the pizzas are not cheap.  $18 for a12\" thin-crust with just one topping.  Which would be a bit of crime in Chicago.  We took it in-stride based on the ambiance, taste, and experience.  I will echo other reviews when I say, \"don't expect white-glove service\" from the wait staff, but this was definitely not a deal-breaker.  PS:  the parking situation is a head-and-shoulders improvement above their other locations!"}
{"text":"Arrogance or ignorance?  I don't know and I don't care.

Dec 7th, I got home and considered my options.  A stuffed pizza from Oregano's, God, that sounded SO good. I called at 8:13pm and ordered the pizza.  \"You know this pizza takes like an hour\" the super-happy server asked.  \"Yes I do\", I said.

At 9:00, I left my place at 20th St. and Missouri Avenue.  7th Street was closed.  ?!!!  Central Avenue: closed.  7th Avenue, closed.  A parade...

Oreganos: Thank you for calling Oreganos!
Me: Hey, that pizza for Teddy?  Won't be able to pick it up...
Oreganos: Why is that?
Me: BECAUSE ALL THE STREETS THAT LEAD TO YOUR RESTAURANT ARE CLOSED!!!!!!!!!!  Why wouldn't you tell me that?
Oreganos: Oh...I thought that parade would be over by now.  (Laughing) I could 'run it out to you'...oh, just kidding!

Literally, while hungry, an entire 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back.  Oreganos didn't know or didn't care...that The Parade of Lights Parade all but closed access to their restaurant.  Fool me over and over again.  All for the love of a stuffed pizza.  

Hey!  Oreganos!  I'll come back, at some point.  But my point now is, it'll be 6 months-year from now, instead of one/week.  Any kind of customer service, \"Gee, sir, I'd love to get you that pizza but you'll have difficulty getting in here until 9:45\", that kind of customer service.

So, I could not go south but I could go north. I ate a delicious pizza from the new Rosatti's on 16th and Missouri.  Fabulous!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last Friday night with the family. Was a mostly positive experience but with a few negative takeaways. 

The Good: Our server Alyssa was one of the best, if not the best, server we've ever had take care of us anywhere. Very attentive, friendly, and really helped make our experience much better than it could have been (more to come on that in the upcoming \"the bad\" section). When the food finally made it out of the kitchen, it was excellent (again, more to come on that) All of our pasta, salads, and pizza were excellent. 

The Bad: We were extremely disappointed with the slow service out of the kitchen. All of the nearby tables were in the same world of hurt with the same long waits for their food. Not sure what the issue was, but luckily Alyssa kept checking on us and made sure our drinks were always nice and full.

Hoping to update this review to a full five stars upon our next visit!"}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza!!!! 
The best pizza I had in a long time. Great authentic flavor, calm environment, good service. Plenty of options in the menu. Definitely I place to visit when looking for good Italian food.

Went out with some coworkers and we were all extremely satisfied with the place, the food and the service. Desert was in the house!!!! 

5 people. Salad, two pizzas, soft drinks and desert $64.00 plus tip!!! Coming from California, this was definitely a bargain. A must try when visiting Arizona"}
{"text":"The food is super tasty and delicious we love the garlic chicken parm of course their pizzas are phenomenal I prefer this surprise location because of its easy accessibility the waitresses and servers I've had at this facility are always happy smiling punctual it is an Italian restaurant so there will be a wait for the food but it's worth the wait will be returning again shortly"}
{"text":"We went tonight for dinner..this was our first time to any Oregano's.  The service was FANTASTIC and our food (Chicken Alfredo, dinner salad, and a thin crust pizza) was really good.  There was enough food that I didn't need to order a child's dinner for my son (In fact, we had enough leftover for lunch tomorrow).  We were immediately seated.  We chose to sit on the patio (there was plenty of room inside) which was fun but too many flies to make it totally enjoyable.  Next time we will sit inside.  My only negative would be that they put the bread sticks under the pasta of the Chicken Alfredo and that makes them too soggy ( I would serve on top or the side)  and it was a little pricy for casual dinning. Thanks for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Had the roasted chicken lasagna and wife had parmesan eggplant. Both were delicious. The only negative is the house salad. It's mostly iceberg lettuce. Don't bother ordering it."}
{"text":"Kids love the thin.  Oldest always gets Diablo with Chicken.  Big Beef is good but upset they hit got rid of wasabi coleslaw.  It was bomb.  One of my families go to spots"}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona for a little bit and my friend said we have to try Oreganos. And it did not disappoint! There was a wait for 4 of us, on Sunday night around 8, so I knew it was gonna be good. We got the golden wings and the barbecue chicken pizza as an appetizer (go big or go home, right?) and they were really delicious. I got the Stuffed Riga Tony and it was also really good. They even offer to sprinkle on EXTRA cheese on your meal, which is always a plus! Our waitress was really nice, though it seemed like she forgot about us several times. I never got a refill on my drink, which I thought was strange and something that should be automatic. The parking lot was also not capable of holding the amount of people there, but we parked across the street and it wasn't a huge deal. But even with those things, the food was so good, I wish I could go back today!"}
{"text":"Not too exciting. Decent food. Just another chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Clearly a family friendly large party destination. But if there is just two, try sitting at the bar. Fried Calamari not exactly the real stuff but tasty nevertheless. Good pasta and sandwiches. Pleasant staff even if seemingly overwhelmed at times. Place seems like it would benefit from a good scrubbing down all over, but the open kitchen appears to be clean."}
{"text":"We came on a weekday after lunch rush... Hardly any guests... We thought oh good, they aren't busy... Uh, no, that just meant the servers made their lunch money and were now doing side work instead of actually waiting on anyone else. It took FOREVER to get seated, it took FOREVER to get our drinks, even LONGER to take our order- and our server was a ditz. I asked if they had a \"side\" salad, you know a small salad to eat before your meal... She pointed me to the Lunch salad with chicken for $9... i asked again if there was a SIDE salad... and she said \"well thats what i showed you\"... NEVERMIND... it took FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER to get our food. Now I will say that my special- the chicken pesto mini was AMAZING (which is why i gave 2 stars and not 1), my hubbys sandwich was marginal, the cole slaw was terrible. My girls pasta, was nothing special. It took FOREVER to get refills. We asked for boxes and the check at the same time (and of course they \"have\" to box it for you, which took another 10 min for her to finally come back... and she didn't even bring the check!!!  I reminded her about the check as we were all CLEARLY packing up and getting ready to LEAVE... WE HAD BEEN DONE FOR 15 min. She brings the check, i have my CC in hand (standing, holding baby and diaper bag ready to pay and leave) and just want to glance it over and she disappears!! My hubby takes the older kids outside who have endured sitting still FOR LONG ENOUGH... I stand there, and stand there, and stand there... I can see her through the glass by the kitchen on her PHONE!!! THAT EXPLAINS SOOOOOOO MUCH!!! We arrived around 2:15 on a tuesday afternoon and didn't leave until 3:55!"}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME! I could not get over how friendly everyone at the restaurant was (\"Oh, you haven't been here before? Let me give you a tour\") and if you had to wait for a table, they would serve your beverages while you are waiting. We ordered the spinach salad and added shrimp (which were basically huge grilled prawns) which was delicious and then a simple small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The crust was thin and crispy and the pepperoni and mushrooms were baked under the cheese so that you would not lose any of the toppings on to your plate! Just the regular salad and small pizza was enough to stuff both me and my boyfriend! You cannot go wrong at this place, our best lunch experience in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is about 2 things. Good thin crust pizza and the pizza cookie. It's hard to find real good pizza in AZ, but the thin crust pizza here is really pretty decent. The pizza cookie is amazing. Truly you could just go right to the cookie if you are brave enough. The atmosphere is just OK. Usually a wait on the weekends and the service is fine. If you are in the Phoenix area and craving pizza this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"Waiting on our food as I'm typing. Service leaves a lot to be desired. Requests go unserved. Cups remain empty. Food on table is getting cold as we wait for what we asked for. Because of this I can't comment on food quality. First time here. Not impressed. The service alone killed it for me."}
{"text":"Let me start with I have tried to eat here 3 times and the wait times have all been 2 hours or more. On a Friday I can understand but even on a Monday or Thursday. 

Well today I decided to try an odd time came in at 3:15 PM and was told it would be 10 minutes before they would have a ready table and there were 2 other 2 tops ahead of me. I mean really at 3 in the afternoon there is still a wait. This is just poor planning either not enough staff or they have no idea how to seat a restaurant. 

Food: So I had Alfredo the dark with 2 meatballs and wheat pasta so it had to change to penne which is fine. It was really good. 
I also ordered Brussel sprouts and she told me they would take 20 minutes so she had my pasta come out first. They were amazing. Roasted with rosemary and parmesean on top. 

So the food is good, the service is good but I am not sure I would go back with the wait times as they are. It just does not seem worth the effort. 

Service was great. She was very nice."}
{"text":"Great place! Fun atmosphere with vintage Jazz music. Had the hot wings...sauce was pristine! We personally love flat bread pizza and their flat pizza was very good! Friendly, accommodating staff. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Wooooow. I was very impressed with this place. Kinda surprised by the 3-stars. It seems like most of the complaints are about the wait for the food. If you go in expecting it, it's really not a problem. Our server let us know at the beginning that the pizza would take about 45min to come out because it was being made from scratch--sounds fine to me! 

I came here with my two sister-in-laws. We had a round of Drunken Monkeys, which were VERY strong and tasty. We started with a regular-sized dinner salad ($5.99) which was just the right size for the three of us. Then an appetizer of garlic bread came out. It didn't seem much longer until our Grandma G's pizza came out. The pizza was HUGE, fresh and delicious! The three of us ate until we were stuffed, and then two of us brought home separate boxes with the leftovers, which were enough for a lunch for the both of us! 

At the beginning of the dinner, I had ordered a Hawaiian (canadian bacon and pineapple) Chicago-style deep-dish pizza to-go for my husband. He LOVED it. It lasted him 3 meals--the pizza was so heavy! You could do your weight reps for the day with that pizza...

I am definitely a fan of Oreganos and will definitely be back! Word of advice though, GO EARLY!! We went at 5:15pm, and were seated promptly and the food came out in a reasonable time. The place was very full, and I'm sure the later you go, the longer the wait is."}
{"text":"Was able to sit down as soon as I arrived thanks to the yelp waitlist. The food was delicious and our waitress was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Had a great pizza and salad. Set at the outdoor patio which is just beautiful food was great our server Erin was fantastic will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I had the bistro classic and that pizza was OOOOOMMMMGGG freaking good! I wish I could have eaten the whole thing, I wanted to keep eating why did I have to get full?? The crust was crunchy and the cheese was so tasty, the basil and tomatoes on top were perfect! My only complaint was the pizza came out a little cold but they sent it back and warmed it up, they were pretty busy that night. Our waitress was very attentive and apologetic about the pizza temp. We also ordered the garlic bread and marinara you can see by my photo that was just amazing it had to have been about two feet of cheesy bread, along with a strawberry lemonade which was off the charts yummy! Seriously no complaints my mouth is watering just thinking about it now! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Great! Came here last night with 2 friends for dinner and we had a good experience. We ordered a big Julius Caesar salad, the sweet potato pos, and a 16in half O-Riva half veggie pizza. I loved the Mediterranean toppings and the thin crust was pleasant, though I normally prefer a thicker crust. The salad was simple but delicious: just enough croutons and cheese and not too much dressing. The potato pos had cinnamon dusted on them, which I loved. We ordered a pizza cookie for dessert and this place is awesome about customizing orders. Being with a group of people, you have different tastes and preferences so it was really nice that they could do half and half. We got half chocolate chip and half peanut butter chocolate. I liked the original better, even though I love PB. Fun atmosphere, didn't have to wait long for a table, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"All of the Oregano's are good, but this one is the best. They aren't stingy on the sauces and the service is great!"}
{"text":"YAY!!!  We had the best experience here.  The service from everyone (mostly teenagers) was excellent.  They were all smiles, accommodating, and confident.  Everyone seemed willing and anxious to help each other out, which made our experience even better.  The food - well, it's Oregano's, so it's awesome.  Salads are huge and great, the pizza (we had Bistro Classic thin crust) is amazing. And don't forget the pizzookie.  It's incredible.  

Seriously back to the service, though.  We could not say enough great things about how we were treated, as though everyone was genuinely happy to see us and wanted to make sure every need and whim was accommodated.  We sat on the patin and enjoyed the sunset and music. Beautiful views of Black Mountain too.

This is a great thing for Cave Creek - awesome food and service combined in a great restaurant.  Thank you for opening!! :)"}
{"text":"The pizzas are good and the dough for kids to play with keeps little ones busy but the lasagna and spaghetti was not very good."}
{"text":"The food was execellent, love the shrimp scampi and the bizookie! The portions are big. Customer service was excellent i will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Usually a big fan but very disappointed in this location. I am familar with their training staff to greet/say hello to EVERYONE, but this can get annoying when one is not even making eye contact with you. It was FREEZING inside the restaurant and even at the outside bar. Initial greet at bar was pleasant but name was never given. Once we ordered bartender really never noticed us again. I was going to ask about temperature but couldn't catch her eye. Saw one patron go get a coat from her car, which I was forced to do as well. 2nd shift came on and proceeded to talk about her school problems at loud volume for an extended period of time, then changed into her work shirt BEHIND THE BAR. Everyone seemed preoccupied with the obvious regulars at the end  of the bar. food was good as usual."}
{"text":"The Picasso salad was great. Lady is a scampi pasta dinner also good.Margarita pizza however was so-so. Lastly we Went online to be a part of the waitlist. They anticipated 13-30 minute wait, however ended up being closer to 50 minutes---not sure if checking in online really saved us anytime.."}
{"text":"God forbid you ask them to not put onions on your Pizza.  They don't seem to have anyone checking orders against the tickets.  They're food is expensive so you'd think they'd get it right but we've had multiple issues over past orders.  Luckily neither my wife or I have food allergies but some day their gonna mess up the wrong persons order and hurt someone.  And they are not nimble when fixing orders.  I'm still standing here waiting for my pizza 30 minutes after they messed up my original order and didn't even offer to comp me or give me a Soda."}
{"text":"Best pasta I've had in Scottsdale and the pizza is good too. Definitely recommend the Alfredo the Dark pasta."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over five years. Today was the first time I did not have a good experience. Wings not cooked and onions in salad. Ugh. It will be a while before I return."}
{"text":"I love this place! The environment is a total blast from the past - fun pictures on the wall, fun music, and a staff of enthusiastic employees. The food is great and the dessert is even better. Chocolate chip pizza cookie holds a special place in my heart!"}
{"text":"I heard that the food was good, but the service was poor.  I'd have to say that lived up to expectations.

The server seemed like he didn't really like his job.  Not much personality, and really didn't take the time to give us suggestions or explain the menu when we said that was our first time there.  Not so much as a smile, or a \"How you folks doing?\", etc.  Just kinda dragged the atmosphere down.

I did find it cute that they had a small pizza tray and a hunk of dough there for my 15-month old son to play with.  It's safe for him to eat too, we made sure there weren't raw eggs in it.

We ordered the Dinner Salad, cheesy bread, and the Uncle Ray's 12\" pan pizza.  Plenty of food for 4 people(probably could have done without the cheesy bread).

Salad was good.  Cheesy bread was okay, a little too cheesy for my taste, but  not bad.  The pizza was much better than I expected.  Crust was good, and the toppings were excellent with good overall flavor.  Definitely will go back for the pizza and salad.  They also have carry-out service, which may be a good alternative.

FYI, call ahead if you know you're ordering a pan pizza, unless you don't mind waiting 35 minutes for the pizza to cook."}
{"text":"I thought we were in the middle of a recession??  Obviously people still need their deep dish pizza regardless of whether they have money or not.  This place is so good I can see how you would go into debt to pay for your pie!  We got their early....about 5:00 on a Saturday.  Clearly not early enough.  The wait was still about 45 minutes.  Once seated, we ordered some appetizers and \"thin\" crust, which come out fairly quick.  The deep dish takes about 45 minutes, so be prepared..  It is worth the wait.  The crust is flakey and buttery fresh.  Sauce is excellent and toppings are abundant.  I haven't experienced all the best pizza places in PHX yet, but this has got to be in the top 10."}
{"text":"We got here at 7. Sat down at 730. Didn't get drink order till 720. Didn't get dinner order till 745. Didn't get dinner till 9:05. You tell me if they deserve a star. I know it's Saturday. But seriously? We were here for a bday, and no free appetizer for wait. Horrible service. Never coming back. And I don't complain this much normally."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I am afraid my review is going to sound a bit repetitious of previous yelps, but I figured I should add my two cents. 

I love Oreganos. When I was attending college in Tucson, Oreganos was just opening up. In fact my roommate and I attended a group interview in an attempt to snag a job, but unfortunately they did not find our request to wear diner outfits and call ourselves Dot and Myrtle amusing. Perhaps we were just too excited to serve pizza. 

I enjoy the pizza (I am not above thin crust), pasta, and atmosphere- in fact it is my in laws favorite place to go when they are in town. The pesto pasta with chicken added is my go to on the menu. The chicken is thin, almost shaved, strips and they absorb all the yummy pesto goodness. The one thing that keeps me from making the drive to Oreganos more often is the wait. No reservations, first come first served type of place and despite them having plenty of seating options, and on occasions open tables, I never seem to get out of there with less than a 30-45 minute wait. Regardless of the time of day, day of week, season, etc. there is always a wait. Once you get past the wait for the table, then you wait a little more for your server, then your food and when it is all said and done my dinner has stretched out to 1 1/2 -3 hours (depending on how many of us) and sometimes there is not enough goodness on a plate that can make up for that amount of time for pizza. 

While some people complain that it is a chain, it is a local start chain, which keeps it out of the axis of evil for me. I will continue to return to Oreganos on occasion, when I have absolutely no plans to follow my meal."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! We always eat here whenever we are in town. Service is always great, friendly staff and amazing food. The Bellinis are so amazing and they are delicious. We always start off with boom dip, split a pizza and/or big rig pasta and save room for the dessert. Awesome place and such a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went a couple days ago.  Had the best pizza I have ever had.  It was deep dish and worth the wait.  Our waitress, Audrey was very friendly and took care of everything we needed.  Salad was great as well.  We'll be back many times I'm sure"}
{"text":"Former fan of this chain
We gave them a couple of weeks to get the kinks worked out before giving them a test drive
Always seemed to be people waiting when we drove past so we expected a good experience
They had a lot of staff walking around yet our service was very slow from getting our drinks to receiving our order. Process is consistently bad
When we got the pizza it was not worth the wait nor the $40 it cost
I normally ignore reviews that focus on the service figuring the people just had a bad day.
In this case I can find nothing positive to say about this location
We dine out 4 or 5 times a week so have a basis for comparison
Go to Uncle Sams for a really good pizza and no drama"}
{"text":"My family has always loved the food here. The fresh pizza is worth the wait time after ordering. The pasta is delicious and the salads are amazing. I was so delighted and impressed today when our waitress brought out pizza dough for the kids to play with while they waited. Whoever thought of this is a genius. My three-year-old is often challenging to eat out with but he was captivated today. Crayons are old news but the dough was so cool to him. He also gobbled up more spaghetti than I have ever gotten him to eat at home. You have won us again oregano's!"}
{"text":"Went to oreganos for the first time and it was so good! I think this is my new favorite spot to eat lol. The portioning for the food is huge! I really recommend this place and recommend the Zany Ziti sooo good! The server was awesome and so was everyone else!"}
{"text":"Alfredo after dark... Best dish ever! If you go around 2 you won't have to wait long."}
{"text":"Dang so many haters on this place. Maybe I came on a good night or something because I really enjoyed my time here.

Yeah this place is retarded crowed, its a chain and the servers aren't perfect but come on now. Did anyone taste the pizza? We had the Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola Sausage and Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato and they were both fantastic. They have a good selection of beer, nice outdoor seating area and their pizza comes correct. Also, if you have any room left get the pizza cookie."}
{"text":"Seven visits to three of their six locations, and I keep having a hard time choosing a best location!  Fortunately, the closest to us is on Elliott Road, and have frequented it the most, though not the quaintest of the locations, it is fantastically terrific.  Oregano's has become our 'go-to' Italian in the Valley!  To date of all the menu items we've been able to enjoy have included: their 10\" Stuffed Deep Dish with Caramelized Onions, Meatballs, Spiced Feta; the fabulous Italian Wedding Soup; the Zany Ziti with Sausage which is soooooo good, and I know a great Ziti when I taste it; Oregano's supremely delish Boom Dip; Numero One-O 12\" Pizza; the decadent Chicken Parma Pasta; the incredible super Stuffed Riga Tony - superb; their incredibly fresh Big Dinner Salad with Ranch Dressing; Boom Dip; 10\" Whole Stuffed Pizza with Sausage, Mushrooms & Onions; the stupendous Flag Lasagna with Meatballs & Sausage; and the Clark Street 16\" Pizza; just to mention a few dishes.  Their beer and wine selections are terrific, from the Biggie Dos Equis; Canyon Chardonnay; Candoni Pinot Grigio Wine; ice cold Lagunitas Beer Pint Draft; Canyon Cabernet; Dos XX Pint; to the Sangria Blanco.  When in the mood for Italian, nothing fancy mind you, Oregano's is where we go, quaint and whimsical décor, great service, attention and reasonably priced, delicious food.  Ottimo cibo!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious!  I personally like the American flag plate!  I would have have them 5 stars but the wait time is really long"}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous! I paid over $20 for the smallest chicken BBQ pizza they have. It was pathetic! I can't stress enough how ripped off I feel. There were 2 small pieces of chicken on the whole pizza that couldn't have cost more than 50 cents. The rest of the pizza couldn't have cost more than $3 total! I thought I'd try it out, I did, and I'm crazy disappointed. Go to Little Caesars. It's more value for the money and taste better."}
{"text":"When I went to this establishment, my husband and I ordered two different things, the baked ziti and a pepperoni stuffed crust pizza.  The ziti was excellent and that is the reason I gave this place 2 stars.  The pizza was definitely not what I was expecting.  The entire pizza was stuffed with cheese and a few pepperonis, it wasn't just the crust.  The crust was more of a deep dish style crust and was too crunchy and hard for my liking.  I will most likely stick with the thin crust as the reviews on it are way better."}
{"text":"Opening day and it lived up to the Oreganos we know and love.    Great food, great service."}
{"text":"We had the best time there! Everyone was very welcoming! Our waitress was awesome! The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here last weekend, did the happy hour thing. We all had yens for different things so we got em all and shared. We started with the sliced beef salad, which I did not expect to like but ended up being really good. Also had an order of plain old Spaghetti and meatballs, again, no complaints, and their pizza i always good, got the thin crust this time but have never been disappointed there. Best garlic bread ever!

Service is another area I find good at every Oreganos I visit. Our waitress was cute and personable and my glass did not sit empty (My pet peeve). 

Nice place to take the family or your date. Pretty predictably good."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were visiting from out of state, and decided to try Oregano's because of great Yelp reviews.  We were not disappointed! The music and décor were retro and very fun.  We sat outside on the patio (beautiful weather) and were promptly served. The wait staff is friendly and attentive and the food was incredibly delicious. We both agreed that the food is much better than Olive Garden, and the prices are quite reasonable.  Wish we had one in Washington!"}
{"text":"10 million stars for the amazing food!!  Wish I could be more specific but everything I've ever had here is glorious!  The first time I came here was about 6 years ago and I dream about it regularly ever since.  The service is great too but only if you can look past the hour and a half wait like I did tonight-yikes!  Please open more Oreganos!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 6:30pm on a Friday night and got seated by 6:50pm. They had complimentary bite size samples of their numero uno pizza for the waiting guests so I thought that was nice. 

Food was good but kitchen was slow! We ordered the Mergherita Pizza, Pablo Picasso salad and 24k wings - the only problem is it took 50 mins for food to come out so we sort of lost our appetite due to the long wait."}
{"text":"Considering this location just opened, a 2-3 hour wait is not uncommon, especially on a Sunday night. We anticipated a longer wait for a table than it actual took. We were able to grab a couple drinks and hang out in front while we waited. Once we were seated our waitress, Casey, was great as well as our appetizer. We ordered their signature pizza and a few other dishes. We did request everything at the same time, knowing it would take 40 minutes for the pizza. It took longer than the times quoted but the food was amazing and definitely worth it. The manager, Dominic, came to the table to apologize and in my opinion went ABOVE & BEYOND what I ever anticipated. Simply due to Dominic's professionalism and willingness to make things right is what will bring me back, even with an hour plus wait!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband love this place! We always get the best service. Last couple time I was in Alex helped us and she was awesome! So attentive and fast. She knew our daughter was done so she rushed to get our check back just like we asked. We loved her!"}
{"text":"Large portions! I'd recommend sharing something. Decor is eclectic, food was quick, waitress was attentive. Very good food"}
{"text":"Had the O-reva pizza! I recently went to Italy and this crust is the closest I have had since being back. It was very good. Passion fruit tea was excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome patio setting. Our waitress was very friendly and fast with the food. I was a little surprised at the menu and the lack of pizza options though. I think I've tried the margarita pizza and really liked it but I was dieting the last time I went and ordered the pesto pizza-it seemed a little too pesto-y and no other flavor kinda, but my husband liked it so...huge drinks and really great sweet potato fries with amazing dipping sauce. I just love the atmosphere at these places. The one in Tempe off of university I believe is my fav though. Their patio is very fun and awesome!"}
{"text":"About 1530 on a weekday afternoon.  

Appetizers, Review colored by the reheated wings that came out.  Skin tighter and drier than an aged truckstop lot lizard had them going back on the first bite.  I've eaten at four Oregano's in the valley and none of them tried to pass barely reheated wing. This was fixed by them making a new set, you know like the ones paid for. 

The other order of BBQ wings were great  it's amazing what a bit of prior warning can do. 

Brushchetta :  Crudely cut tomatoes, minimal to trace levels of garlic and basil on quite dry bread, had a look at menu and there's meant to be red onions in it too. It was just large tomatoes in oil.  Appearance , color is there,  bland, left most of it. 

Main: 
 
Kid's pasta bowl, fair price for the amount.  

Pesto Penne Bake. 
Like the problem dishes referred to above it it had the appearance but, green isn't a flavor, the chicken was dry, the garlic and onion once again  taking a back seat or missing the flight  entirely.  So unless you develop synthesia over lunch and begin to taste color it's not that great. 

Lasagne. Solid as ever 

Servers, great, no problems there, they don't make the food after all, and quickly corrected it, but the rating  really reflects the initial offering and in matters other than service this location fell far short of my prior outings with them."}
{"text":"The review is an average of five stars for food and service but 3 stars for patio atmosphere. The patio is nice but unless you get a lucky perimeter spot you are in full sun and there are no umbrellas. It seems like a petty complaint but after 30 min you really feel it. You spend your meal squinting to see and waiting for s shady spot to open up. The sunburn is real. The food and the service were awesome though."}
{"text":"Thank you for bringing back customer service! We were so well attended here that I didn't even care about the 1.5 hour wait. It was totally worth it. Our server was the quickest, sweetest, and kindest server we have had in a long time. 

We started with a guacatony. It was so good we ate it all and didn't save room for our dinner but it was ok because we took our food to go. Our main meal was a baked ziti and the Alfredo in the dark. The portions are huge! And there is so much flavor in everything. I love it! 

I would definitely recommend to anyone if they love carbs. Because that all you get. Lovely, delicious, cheesy carbs. Also never skimp on the pizza cookie. It is delectable and a hit. Thanks again future medical doctor for being an awesome server. :-)"}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times now and always enjoy it. Guaca-Tony is pretty good and huge portions. Nice place to take the family and some good beer selections also."}
{"text":"We love Oregano's.  The prices are great, and the food is outstanding, although the portions are HUGE.  The only thing that we don't like is the wait.  Every location is just as good as the others.   I recommend the Boom Dip and the Oregano's Favorite salad, and no trip to Oregano's is done until we've had the pizookie dessert."}
{"text":"Visited the downtown area after an event at the Gilbert Historical Museum. The service, food and ambience at this restaurant was fantastic! Thanks for a great night guys!"}
{"text":"Please Oreganos, come to Cali!!! 

I love this place sooo much. Everytime we come to Phoenix for spring training, I salivate knowing what's coming up...OREGANO'S!!!
We always have a bigger party when we come and they do everything they can to accomodate us. This last time, we screwed up and gave the wrong number of people and when they tried to sit us, we didn't fit so we had to wait a little longer for another table. The manager came out to us and gave us a free appetizer (fried ravioli with jalapeno cheese...WOW!!). He didn't have to do that since it was our mistake. But, another great reason why I love this place besides the amazing food. The ambiance is great. It reminds me of an old 50's italian joint.

They have your basic Italian food...lasagna, noodles, pizza. Ill stop there. Pizza. Yummo. They have thin, pan and thick crust. We ordered the thin and it was perfect. Can't complain and this is our go to place. 

**Only reason they are getting four stars is the parking and wait. It can get a little long for the wait so don't come hungry...you will get grumpy (MEEE). Parking sucks too so you will have to find a spot on the street somewhere (this location is not in the greatest areas of Phoenix so lock your car)."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they have a Oregano's in Glendale! Way closer to where we stay for Spring Training which is awesome.

Yes, the wait is ridiculous but is so worth it. They have great pizza, pasta and awesome antipasto salad. We ordered their version of a \"pazookie\" which is a cookie and ice cream on top. I have to admit it wasn't as good as BJ's version but it still hit the spot! It was a little too gooey and kind of tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way but still pretty good.

Parking is a little better at this location than the others. Prices are pretty decent for the amount of food you get. There's so much!! One thing I love is they pass out samples of different type of appetizers to try while we are waiting which is pretty cool!

So wish they had Oregano's in Cali!! Can't wait to come back though!"}
{"text":"Sprocooli, deep dish pizza is the best.  It's what we always get and why we come here.  Had the Oregano s favorite salad with chicken which was also great.  Very busy today but we scored bar space.  Thanks for a great Sunday meal and leftovers!!!"}
{"text":"Tempe on University Oregano's used to be our favorite place in the world!  We looked forward to going to it, meeting some of the regular employees, and meeting some guests at the bar while enjoying some of our favorite food.  We have known some staff since this location opened.  We'd been with this location for almost twenty years.  
But the last visit, about a week and a half ago was so terrible, so poor with the female manager \"G...\" and female bartender that we are looking for a new favorite location.  Both employees tried to provoke by being very nasty and confrontational and neither could get over the fact we made a mistake and sat in one of the few high top tables that are between the bar and the window (used to be open seating). From about fifteen feet away Manager G blared out at us, as if the evening was an Amazing Race Contest, we we had done a dine and dash, or were bad kids that had gotten three previous warnings, that we needed to get up immediately as she was the manager. How embarrassing... several tables heard it, one table later told us, they had noticed it was a \"bad day\" for the staff.  Anyway, It was odd, we just sat down someplace that others sat for forty five minutes while they awaited for a table.  We had enjoyed conversations with those people their home area of an Diego and wait staff asked them several times what they wanted and they said they were just waiting for a table and sitting at the high top.  Thus, we had no idea, since we had sat there before, and these people had sat there for 45 minutes that we had done an unforgivable act.  Seating was a disaster, a crowd from baseball, although three people patrolled the hostess stand they were obviously overwhelmed and and I say patrolled because they seemed to hate their jobs that night. 
When we finally got to sit down at the bar, at legal open seating we ordered wings. The first thing out of the bartender's mouth was \"I know my  manager and you didn't get along\".  We  replied, we didn't know the four high top tables were now seating only by a host or hostess--I wasn't done with my comment but the bartender interrupted me and said very sharply \"the high top tables have never been open seating (incorrect). Regardless, we let that go and the bartender then finally hurled menu's at us.  We had to request water.  We had to request eating utensils.  We ordered wings, and they came out about forty minutes later, cold to the touch. Someone seating near us had noticed the rudeness of the female \"G\" manager and bartender particularly to us and she touched one of the wings--and said these aren't even warm. This resulted in another glare from the bartender, who took the wings without any comment, glared at us, and about twenty minutes later brought us hot wings dropping them on the counter so fast the dressing container almost fell out.  The people beside us again made note and asked if this place was always like that.  I said no, it is our favorite place.  Soon after the female manager made several deliberate attempts to wait on people around us behind the bar, which was odd since she had been so overwhelmed with two others the three running the hostess/host station.  The female manager G would laugh and giggle and loudly talk to others immediately on either side of us, including those seating beside us who were annoyed at the manager and bartender's attitude towards us.  We continued to be ignored, as were our  empty drinking glasses except for glares. The manager came out to apparently confront us and get sympathy, saying she had experienced a very bad day,horrible day.  Then said she had a death to deal with, and \"was just having a difficult day\". I politely told her maybe she should take a break and go home which resulted in her storming off.  We were able to interrupt the bartender to order a pizza and ask for refills of our drinks. Again people around us noticed the rudeness directed at us, apparently for, our earlier unfortunate mistake of seating in a high top seat that used to be open seating years ago.  Not one time during the night were we offered service, asked how our replacement wings were, asked how our pizza was, nor did they ever offer to refill our drinks.  Our bill came.  he female manager made one last round to glare at us.  We paid our bill, and set talking to people about three minutes, that we had just met about things to do with the area.  The bartender taking the bill confronted my friend asking if her service was poor because there was not tip. We hadn't left yet, but decided at that time to revoke any cash we had planned to leave (as it certainly wasn't deserved-but was certainly expected).  We did call, and receive a call from corporate, with an open ear and apology.  That said, we miss you already Oregano's on University. We went from recommending you weekly, if not monthly, four months a year when in AZ to strongly not recommending.  If staff is having that bad of a day they should stay in the back or go home."}
{"text":"As always we had an amazing family dinner here. Please ignore the one star reviews for the slow service and wait times. It is we'll known to anyone in the valley that if you go here there will be a wait but you can order wine and sip it while you wait and they have a shaded waited area with chairs. Additionally the service is very attentive it is just that all food is prepared fresh and it takes a long time to bake lasagna or a deep dish pizza! That's why we usually have an appetizer.  Tonight we tried something new: brussel sprouts to start. They were roasted with rosemary and the perfect thing to tie us over until the meal came. Finally the portions and prices here are always awesome. You will not leave hungry and you will have a box to take home. So go out enjoy the slower pace and home cooked meal and have a great time."}
{"text":"Love Oregano's. Been going to Oregano's for good 10 years. Started off in Tempe, while I was going to ASU. Wonderful food no matter what you get. I've tried pasta, pizza, salad, just sooo good. Not to mention Pizza-Cookie(forgot the spelling of real name) is to die for. I don't care what BJ's says ( they claim that their's is original and better) I think Oregano's Pizza-Cookie is the Best!

My one and only request I ask everytime I go there is to open a store in west side. I love the place, just too far... but I always try to find a reason to drive there."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I found out that Oregano's is opening up in the west side, which I have been asking for almost 10 years. I expected to have a long wait just like any other Oregano's I've been to. 

That said,

My first visit to this location was couple weeks after they opened. I ordered Beefstro salad and Bollo Pasta. They had no knowledge of menu at all... When I asked the hostess how long it was gonna take, she said it'll be 45 minutes. I replied with \"for a salad and pasta?\" right then, the manager was walking by and overheard my question and said, \"no, not for a salad and Bollo Pasta, it'll only be 10-15 minutes\". That sounded better, so I walked over to the bar, which only has 4 tightly close seats, saw that they were all taken, of course, just ordered my drink and stood in the walk-way. There were no other place to wait for food and outside waiting area was WAY over crowded. After 45 minutes..... (hostess was right) I finally got my food and took it to my work (good thing I had plenty of time before my shift) opened my food and I couldn't find any beef on my Beefstro salad. Just a big box of greens! So I called... and surprisingly the hostess knew that I was missing my beef and asked me to come back and get them (She said she had it right there and forgot to put it in my bag). I was already at work so I wasn't able to. If they had not taken so long to get my food in the first place, I probably had came, but no. So she puts me on hold and gets the manager. He tells me to come get the meat. Again, I said I can't. So then he said he will give me a salad for free next time I come in. So I said sure. I couldn't stop by to get the salad, so I called up again and he just mailed me a $15 gift card (one week later). 

Second visit (to use my gift card).

It was around 1 pm on Saturday. There were 2 hour wait for a table. I walked around and saw that the couple on the bar was about to leave. Stood behind them so I could grab their seat as they leave. (woo-hoo no wait!!)  The bartender was so busy/inexperienced/stressed/overwhelmed that it took him 10 minutes to greet us.10 minutes for our beer. Another 10 minutes to take our order. Not to mention other people trying to order drinks while they wait leaning over our shoulders and standing next to us the entire time... I like sitting at bar for easy of ordering. Not this time. Watching him made me uneasy for how stressed he was. I got my salad, Pizza Cookie (they changed the name?) and left. Unpleasantly

Third visit.... did not happen because I called to make a take out order and was told that it will take an hour for a Beefstro Salad. Just like some of the other reviews I saw, food is good, but 1 hour wait for a salad is bit absurd. 


Very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The server hardly paid any attention to us and the beer glass was chipped and almost cut my sister.  The manager was rude and the food took forever to come out plus it wasn't even busy. I love this place but this was a horrible experience."}
{"text":"I have been going Oregano's almost every other weekend the for the past 4 years. So the food is good but I normally go to this Oregano's because of the employees. They are always nice and respectful. One of the bartenders that has been there since i started going to Oreganos even remembers my name and often asks me about my family and issues i have talked about with him previously.(I do not want to mention his name for privacy reasons) So everything at the restaurant was great! That was all until about a month ago.

They recently changed management and the entire feel of the restaurant has changed as well. It no longer has a family feel. to it and has become more about business. I no longer feel it is welcoming but rather I'm just another customer taking up a seat. 

My favorite bartender was once scolded in front of multiple customers and It made the entire restaurant uncomfortable.  Its just sad that his manger feels the need to make a scene like that. I obviously don't know the situation but i personally feel making a scene in front of customers is bad business. 

I even asked the bartender to enlighten me about what was happening but he said \"It isn't my place to talk about right now\"

Sadly i was informed that my favorite bartender was released after more than 4 years of service at this chain. When I found out I asked other customers if they were aware of the past bartender and his release and multiple people stated they were upset with his leaving. 

I suppose he was not only personable to me but to multiple \"regulars\" to the restaurant. After talking with multiple people that day i realized that many other employees felt he was \"wrongfully released\" by the new management. 

I haven't seen the bartender since the day his manager made a scene in front of the restaurant but hopefully I will run into him again at another establishment. 

In summation the food is good, but I will not be going back to Oreganos any time soon because the management has lost sight of what makes this restaurant so successful. A welcoming family environment has been put aside for no reason and i want no part in that type of business."}

{"text":"I usually love this place. We got her at 255pm on a tuesday, it's me and my 2 kids, it's 3:42 now and we still haven't gotten our food. We ordered about 30 min ago. Looking around there are 2 other tables with people and 1 of them is ready to leave. Super bummed that it's been such slow service. Especially when my kids just got spaghetti & I got a small pasta."}
{"text":"WOW! This place rocks. The BF and I were in town for a couple days and we stopped in for dinner. My BF lived in Scottsdale for a bit and insisted we come to Oregano's for dinner. I'm glad we did just that! It was a warm, glorious Arizonia evening and Oregano's was the happening place. We didn't have a reservation so we ended up sitting on the deck and enjoying the evening. The host told us about an hour but it was more like 35 minutes. We'll take it! 
We started with the Boom Dip. A nice blend of cheeses, spinach and artichokes served with a flatbread like chip. Man, was this good! The portions are HUGE and the prices are LOW. You do the math! Next, I had the Bollo Pasta. This was a simple angel hair pasta with Oregano's housemade Marinara. Packed with flavor and freshness. It was 6.99 and I couldn't make a dent. I was also informed that you could get refills on this pasta. My BF had the shrimp scampi. Non-traditional but tummy loving delicious. A nice kick of spice at the end and tons of shrimp. Now that I think about it, was this all a dream..? I wish there was a place like this in Los Angeles. You win Scottsdale. You win!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite treats in the Valley! I have always received great service and AMAZING FOOD! 

Sure there's a wait, but its only because everyone loves this place. Highly recommend the Pizookie! Large servings, I cant say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"We were in town for my daughters graduation from ASU, she wanted pasta and this place was close. The place was packed but cleared quickly so the wait wasn't long. The atmosphere is good. Kind of loud but still cozy. We ordered 3 lemonades with alcohol and one without and you couldn't tell the difference, so that is where they lost a star. We weren't looking to get stuck but $7.50 for a lemonade is a little steep we ordered the boom dip the calamari and the shrimp appetizers. The Cala Marie was just ok but the other two were great ( and the bread that co
Ea with the dip is SO good! We ordered two diablo shrimp pasta a shrimp scampi and a Riga tony? All were fabulous! We wanted the pizza cookie but did t have room and had to take most of our meals home. The customer service was great as well. I would definitely go back if I'm ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"Nomnomnomnomnom! So yummy and such generous portions! I would tone down the sea salt on the salted caramel pizookie though."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Oregano's! My boyfriend and I went on our first eating date here and still go back every time we can! Love the food, the atmosphere and most of the time the help is phenomenal! I highly suggest you at least try it and see, I can almost 100% guarantee you'll LOVE it!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation of a colleague.    Atmosphere is very interesting, really liked it.  Casual place.  Food was delicious and wasn't ridiculously priced like most things around here.  I had the stuffed Riga Tony which was excellent and I loved the garlic bread that comes with the meal. Boyfriend had an oregano ziti dish with chicken that he really enjoyed.   Portions are really big.  We also split a Caesar salad (big) which was enough for 4 people.  We had food leftover so I would suggest sharing."}
{"text":"Big portions, garlic bread is nice, salads are also pretty good but the Lasagne is pretty bad - microwaved - avoid the Lasagne"}
{"text":"We are regulars and always receive excellent food and service. We went last night and had Stephanie as our server. She took our service to a whole new level! It was as if she invited us into her own home. She was amazing! Food was excellent as always."}
{"text":"They have wonderful service and food is delicious. I would highly recommend you go here. Atmosphere is warm and cozy."}
{"text":"Have been to oreganos multiple times. I had by far the worst experience. Elliot and Priest. I normally NEVER leave bad reviews, just not that kind of person. This restaurant is run by a terrible manager. He has no respect for guests or care for customer service. Our waitress was great, our food was made completely incorrectly and cold after taking quite long to arrive when we ordered wings and salad. The manager talked down to us like we were kids. I eat out multiple times a week and have never been treated like this. Will never be coming back here again and i suggest you never come to this location.."}
{"text":"The food was great ! However one of the front hosts was quite rude and unaccommodating .  We asked if we could order for our little one while we waited , and were told we could only pre-order if it was stuffed crust or pan but not off the kids menu . Huh??!"}
{"text":"Bad service today. Again...!?!?!? Usually come here with great service. My wife got here ahead of us and a waiter took her order. I arrived and waited for service, waited some more and finally a waitress took our order. Ordered our usual and the appetizer took about 15 mins then watched all the people around us order and get their food. So as im typing this review, we are still waiting. After about 20 mins we got our order. I dont know whats going on here, but may have to try another location. My first post was similar to this review, but for some reason it never posted. So this is the second time in a row this has happened to us..."}
{"text":"The manager at this restaurant could be one of the most rude individuals I have ever met. The food was cold and low quality. He didn't care and just blamed my table for our standards. I have been coming to Oregano's since their first location on Scottsdale Road, over 20 years. But they have now lost a loyal customer due to one poor manager."}
{"text":"Like most places that serve deep dish pizza, Oregano's is very crowded, which is only further fueled by the long periods of time it takes to prepare that particular style of pizza. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course. It's just a system where wait times should almost always be expected.

Years later, I'm still kind of in shock that Oregano's decided to open a location in West Valley, something that Sam Fox wouldn't do even with a gun held to his head. But as for this Camelback location? It's mostly what you'd expect. Typical Oregano's food with servers that are friendly, although somewhat slow.

I work with someone who absolutely loves Oregano's, but often forgets that in order to go here for lunch, you need to set aside a significant amount of time in your schedule, as well as arrive here as early as possible. Or else, you'll just end up being waitlisted.

Anyway, while Oregano's is known for their deep dish pizzas, they also have a big following based on many of their other options, including their absurdly large salads and pastas for people who are quantity-obsessed.  Nothing is horrendously bad, but nothing particularly stands out as anything special. Both the Alfredo in the Dark and Big Rig are generously sized Americanized pastas that work for people who want something just a notch above Olive Garden-level.

Their deep-dish pizzas are flaky, often drawing comparisons to a biscuit. Whether that's a good or bad thing really just depends on how your brain is wired, I guess. I recently tried to obtain one of their lunch special \"stuffed pizzas.\" The place had been open for a mere twenty minutes, only for the server to inform me that they were already sold out. You can easily imagine my annoyance while I spent the next hour watching servers bring out multiple stuffed pizzas to other customers while I'm stuck eating a bland pasta. I guess you need to order it within the first five minutes? Christ!

I've always taken issue with the fact that they claim their pizza cookie is the original, when in fact, it was BJ's Brewery that invented it. With that said, their take on the dessert, which has since been duplicated by tons of other restaurants, is actually one of the better versions that you'll be able to find. I consistently give them credit for this.

While I don't think their food is for everyone, if you're more of a traditionalist when it comes to your pizza bistro-styled places, I think you'll feel right at home at this Oregano's."}
{"text":"Why are locals so obsessed with this place? When I hear people rave about how this is the only good pizza place in the entire city, I often wonder what places they're comparing it against. I mean, seriously. There has to be some type of explanation. Pizza Hut, Dominos, Barro's, or Little Caesars? Sure. Oregano's has them beat. But if those are your only places for comparison in a city that is completely littered with quality pizza, then I truly feel bad for what you're missing out on. 

I've eaten at various Oregano's locations several times over the years and my opinion never seems to change. It's nothing more than a local chain that does things just a tad better than your standard cookie-cutter pizza bistro. Apparently, this is all it takes to impress the masses. Oregano's honestly tastes, looks, and feels no different than any other generic eatery in all of Phoenix. I guess by the crowds, I was expecting something more. 

I'd feel guilty completely shredding the place though. I mean, their service has always been good and their food is by no means awful. Their regular pizzas are just okay, but we typically order the deep dish in hopes that it'll eventually grow on me. Maybe if I had never had good deep dish pizza before, I'd sing praises about how wonderful it is. But if you do a little research, there's a few hidden gems that do it much better. The ingredients are okay, but the crust just seems to take on the bizarre flavor of a Pillsbury Doughboy biscuit. Ugh! Their pizza cookie, however, is excellent. I'm willing to admit that much - even if it often gets wrongfully credited by fans as an Oregano's original concept (try BJs). It's the best thing on the menu - hands down.

Maybe it's the salads and pastas that draw the crowds? Who knows.

I'm sure we'll be back at some point down the road, but I don't think it'll ever be good enough to get put into regular rotation. 

Sorry!"}
{"text":"One of the best. I have never had a bad experience here! The service is top notch and they really take care of you! Evan was awesome and he went above and beyond to take care of our large party!"}
{"text":"Came in kinda late but seems to be everyone's dinner hour.  Wait was quoted as 25 min but as usual, it was significantly less.  I went to bar to get a drink while waiting and we decided to camp there. 
Really though, the hostess may tell you it's gonna be 25 minute wait but more often than not it's gonna be closer to 10-15 minutes.  I rather not wait if there's a seat at the bar.
Sydney was on top of things, as always.  She provides great customer service, pours a good drink and knows the menu well.  
I recommend the Anita Margartia, but she makes a refreshing Mojito that's pretty darn perfect too.
I like the veggies sides, a LOT.  Don't know if anywhere else I can get Brussel Sprouts year 'round.  Yummy.
Like and recommend the Bowl o' Pasta if you're really hungry.  I think it's bargain-priced up until 4 p.m.  you can get meatballs meat sauce or sausage with that bowl of pasta for an additional charge too.  Had a salad with steak in it to that I thought was great. Ziti is in a bowl made from pizza crust.  l wasn't too impressed with it because it's such a hard bowl, not really an edible unless it's meant to feed my dogs or chickens.  I suppose you could eat it but it's just kind of hard because they don't make it fresh.
Pizza I've had only once and it just took so long I'll probably never want to order a pizza at Oreganos ever again.
Good good, casual atmosphere, great servers too and a wait that's not typically as long as they quote."}
{"text":"Our drinks tasted alright but the presentationand quality was not as we've received elsewhere.
The food itself took longer than normal but was dismissed since we were chatting.
The \"Our Chicago Italian Sausage\" sandwich was served charred black and mostly unedible.  The two sides I ordered, meatballs and the new Tree Hugger Skillet dish, were not delivered together -and the server did ask if I wanted them together.  All items except the veggie skillet were served at the same time.  Bartender said something indistinguishable and promptly disappeared.  Skillet dish arrived maybe ten minutes later. 
Our server, the bartender guy, didn't once ask if we would like Parmesan on any of our dishes nor did he ask how everything was or check up on us during our meal EXCEPT to ask if we would like another drink.  He didn't speak directly to me but took it upon himself to make a drink for each of us.
FWIW, the person that ordered the Sausage sandwich says he likes his food cooked well done and told me that was a good (looking) char.
Two bites was all he had.
Son decided he would take his leftovers for lunch but couldn't eat it because of the excessive char.
Sounds like it was forgotten on the grill.  Possibly same fate of my veg order which couldn't be concealed in a loaf of bread.
Boo Oregano's kitchen for sending out burnt food.
Boo to last nights bartender for your mediocre customer skills."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar today to avoid children issues and had a fantastic experience. This was our first time at Oregano's so I was just hoping it wasn't like the Olive Garden, and it was not.
Chris was our server/bartender and he was on it. Friendly, knowledgeable and clean.
The food was excellent from appetizer to dessert. Had the big 3: quality, quantity and price.
I won't just be back, I will be back often.
Thanks Chris!"}
{"text":"My husband ate here when he was in town for a conference and said we should try when we come back for a soccer tournament...let's just say I wish we could go back and make another dinner choice. It's like an Olive Garden on steroids. Waited 45 minutes for mediocre food that looked and tasted like it was under the warmer far too long. My sons pizza was thin crust but my goodness it was like paper with cheese. The portions are ridiculously huge which tells you it's not quality food. Been there done that won't be back."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the finest Italian restaurant my wife and I have ever been to the services punctual knowledgable and the food is out of this world I highly recommend originals as probably the very best you're going to find for the amount of money involved good luck I hope you enjoyed"}
{"text":"The food is great service is great but they served my red wine icy cold, really!
I'm not a fan of the old old 1950's music very annoying"}
{"text":"a one hour wait on a thursday around 845? not cool. then having TERRIBLE service because it's close to closing time, definitely not ok. foods OK. (i like their sanwhiches/pasta, but pizza is average.) not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Oregano's gets my vote for best pizookie ever. Their pizza is great, but the pizookie is what sets this place apart. Eating outside in AZ during the hot weather never sounds like a good idea, but it's tolerable under the misters here. Too bad the wait is so long, but so it goes. If you can't drive down to Chandler for BJ's, this is probably the next best bet."}
{"text":"What a great place. The Diablo shrimp pasta is wonderful.  The numero uno pizza was crisp and so flavorful.  We love this place.  Our server Sam is so cute and provided incredible service."}
{"text":"I don't recall having any pizza here, so did this afternoon. Canadian Bacon, Pineapple, Jalapeños, Anchovies, with lots additional parmigiana and oregano. Little bit of salt added. WOW amazing good."}
{"text":"This is my first this location. Busy here this evening and I'm at the bar. Just right here and not crowded...at the bar. I'm starting with a bottle of Reisling. No Moscato apparently. And asked for angel hair, marinara, sausage and shrimp. My favorite this restaurant line. I've only been to location on Shea multiple times. Expect this a good copy.
And it was indeed. No complaints ever here. My favorite in this area."}
{"text":"Two words... Not impressed. Yes the portions are large however the negatives were greater than the positives. Had angel hair pasta with meat sauce. No flavor to the meat sauce at all. It is an extra $.99 and is so bland. There was hardly enough sauce  to cover the pasta so requested a little extra which caused another $.99. Unfortunately it's still did not help the taste. We enjoy background music when eating however the music is so loud that the people in the patio, where we were sitting, we're all shouting to be heard over the music. It was so noisy that I couldn't wait to leave. Lastly the garlic bread was cold and tasteless also. Large portions don't necessarily mean good food. Lastly the service was just mediocre. The waitress was too busy visiting with coworkers to be attentive."}
{"text":"My son took me here for dinner last night for my birthday. It was our 1st time here. We were told it would be a 40 minute wait, we were seated in less than 20. While we waited, we had a drink on the cozy patio. 
Our server Gaby was very sweet and attentive. 
Our food was delish and plentiful-we took half home.
Sorry no pics, we were hungry . 
Because it was my bday, got a free dessert-pizza cookie: choclate chunk cookie with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and chocolate chips, so yummy but had to take most of it home too. 
Prices are very reasonable!
Had a great experience, will definitely be back.
Bonus-its close to home."}
{"text":"I am so sad. I visit here ALL the time, as most college students do. We were celebrating my boyfriend's internship so we decided to order Boom Dip, a Deep Dish Pizza, and a pizookie. The appetizer came out fine, the bread it comes with reminded me of my old work back in california which made me nostalgic. 

Then came the pizza. He ordered half meatballs and mushrooms, I ordered half Cajun chicken and pineapple. When it came out they had made my side a hawaiian (ham and pineapple). I politely informed the waitress then went to the bathroom quickly. The toilet outside was broken so I had to lift up the back and manually flush the toilet (something I never thought I would have to do at a place of business) and by the time I came back they had already talked to my boyfriend about making another pizza, only thin crust (because the deep dish takes 45 min). Then dessert came out delicious as always. 

They didn't comp our pizza like my boyfriend was lead to believe by the manager (which was fine). Nevertheless, I gave the woman a good tip and left. 

I ate the thin crust today (they just immediately boxed it for us I wasn't hungry at that point last night) and there was a HAIR in my pizza. They messed up not one but TWO pizzas for me and I had to flush their toilet. As much as I love this place I am not coming back for a very long time."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a delicious  Chicago pizza this evening. And of course the pizza cookie was over the top because it was FREE ( post birthday treat to myself)."}
{"text":"Great food. The atmosphere is nice: relaxed and interesting. My family has been coming here for every special event ever since I can remember. But, the service has not been a fast and accurate at this location as it once was."}
{"text":"Anyone who has eaten here knows there is a wait so i decided to order to go instead.  I called in an order for pick up at 730pm at 600pm for two salads an order of wings and guacamole.  If you haven't tried the guacamole  I highly recommend it and the salads are about 12 dollars for the large and worth the price. When i arrived at 740pm my food was not ready I was told 10 minutes i had to wait longer than that. Also all the take out 15 minute parking spaces were taken which meant I had to drive around to get a spot.  The food was hot and exactly how it would be if you got it there including the weight"}
{"text":"ALWAYS GOOD.   Okay we've been to this place 5, 6, 7 times maybe more.    And all I can say is that it is consistent and good every time. The Kale Caesar salad is always top-notch. And their pizzas are always made very well.   Our last visit on August 11th, only had one hiccup and that was we had to ask the table server to request to have the music Turn Down. It was blaring, which only served one other purpose in that was to make everyone talk louder or scream at each other at their tables to enjoy their conversation. Needless to say our server was very understanding about it and even told us he thinks it's loud.  But again that is just a minor little annoyance.

All I can say is this place serves good consistent food all the time and we've never been burned here at all. We've always enjoyed what we've ordered and the portion sizes are always very good. Which equates for leftovers the next day and even then the leftovers are just as good.   What's nice as well is they ask if you want a \"to go\" drink for your trip home. And always at no extra cost. This is always well appreciated.

And judging by how crowded this place is all the time it's obvious others think the same way.   Nice to finally give a location 5-stars.   And no I do not work here,  and proof of that is see my other ratings and you'll see that I am very hard on locations that are taking my money and giving me nothing in return. Oregano's is always good value for the money."}
{"text":"I'm sure I don't have to tell you how delicious the food here is, but I will anyways.  My boyfriend and I chose oreganos as our date night spot tonight and I had the pesto penny bake, which was phenomenal.  However that is not even my reason for writing this review.  I just wanted to mention how great our server, Colleen was.  For some reason I chug water when I am at restaurants and I never even got close to an empty glass, and she was just as friendly as it gets.  Thank you Colleen, you're awesome!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is nothing special. It sounds really harsh, but restaurants like Oregano's are a dime a dozen. Think an Italian-style Chili's, take out the Italian, substitute Chicago-style crust and small novel inventions in obese-size portions and you'll arrive at Oregano's. 

I've been twice and both times I was unimpressed. The food was mostly  a sad melding of American-Italian food, introducing the worst parts of both. The sandwich I had was drowned in tomato sauce and even the salads were gigantor. 

The decor reminds me of an Applebee's -- and most certainly not in a good way. I'm honestly at a loss for what to say next. Unless I have my arm twisted, I'm not going to be returning here."}
{"text":"I honestly have never understood the Oregano's hype. There is always an ungodly wait, it's packed (because the locations are tiny) and the food is average.

We attended a dinner with 12 friends and called a week in advance about reservations. Of course, they don't take them but said if we used Yelp, we could jump in line virtually ahead of time. Being familiar with places that utilize the 'No Wait' app, this seemed simple enough. 

An hour before we wanted to eat, I attempted to pt our party in, however for parties of more than 7, it said to call the restaurant. So I did. The restaurant said there was nothing they could do, just to put it in as 6 people and notate that it was 12 people for 7 pm. So we did and called the restaurant to confirm as we received a text that our table would be ready in 20 minutes. The host was very confused but ended up locating the note. We arrived at 6:30 and were seated at 7:20 due to a large party who wasn't getting up after their meal. This just seemed like a lot of hoop jumping. Just take a reservation for large parties, make it easier for everyone. 

Food was average, we ordered a salad and pasta. The prices are supported somewhat by the large portions but not the quality or taste in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is always great food and good service. The only down side I can think of is wait times but that is expected in this area. The patio area is always great ambience."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't posted a review about this place. My family and I have been here well over 100 times in the past 8 years. A delicious, welcoming, vibrant restaurant. It has a large menu with some of the greatest pasta I have ever had. Recommended to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"We were first-timers a couple days ago. What a treat!  Music played from the patio on a perfect sunny day. Upon entering we were welcomed by warm staff.  Food was fast, hot--most of all:  delicious!!   We will be back."}
{"text":"Overall terrible experience. We were sat inside and the space is very cramped and LOUD. The server we had was absolutely the worst sever I have ever had. Many empty drinks glasses, never asking how our food was and just completely ignoring us. We will not be returning to this restaurant again. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Close to restaurant perfection. 

Expect a long wait, but well worth it. BBQ chicken pizza = amazing. Pizza cookie is incredible. Service has never really been lacking. I've been back many times and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Laughing at all the people upset about the wait... What did you expect?? You'll have an hour wait for anywhere on bell road let alone a brand new oreganos!! Idiots. But I digress. 

Standard oreganos. Close to restaurant perfection. Pizza is great, wings are great, service is great, cookie is amazing. Don't want to wait? Go somewhere else. Problem solved."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for a pizza that was never delivered to meet only a meager apology from the waitress who blamed it on the kitchen staff, which as a business owner is in poor taste. After 20 additional minutes of wasting our time, we walked out and said let's go to a real restaurant who focuses on customer service and efficient delivery of great tasting food. #NeverAgain"}
{"text":"Horrible! We got there at 2pm, Saturday. There were maybe 6 employees who just completely ignored us. One of them had the time to talk to her boyfriend sitting by the waiting area and she didn't even had the care in the world to ask us. We waited for 10 mins and decided to go. No it wasnt too busy. What a terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Oregano's a bunch of times now and love the food... You will want to come early for dinner it's always really busy... The staff is always friendly and will seat you as fast as they can... I always order something that's not on the menu the Mild and Gold wings they are the best wings I have had in Arizona it's the mild sauce mixed with the Italian gold sauce so good... Next on to the salad The Antipasto Thing  (Salami, pepperoni, capicolla, Romaine lettuce, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, red peppers, red onions, topped with Italian cheeses and tossed with Italian dressing.) This is the best Antipasto I have had in Arizona now for the pizza... Aunt Margherita Pizza (Light and flaky dough, add pizza sauce, a four cheese Italian blend, fresh cut Roma tomatoes, fresh sliced basil.) After all this food if you still have room what I do is get The Original Pizza Cookie to go ( A 1/2 pound of Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, or Peanut Butter Chocolate cookie dough, slightly baked in a 6-inch pizza pan then topped with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream.  If you're looking for a great dinner this is one place you need to add to your list."}
{"text":"I don't eat Italian very often but I like to get the lasagna at Oregano's.  Very tasty and a great atmosphere.  Good service and very fair prices.  If you want to share a salad, and you do, order the small, it is huge.  Placed is always packed and there is a reason.  They have been making good Italian for many years.  You will enjoy this place.  See you at the bar."}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us ate there last night. Service for large parties at most restaurants is slooow, but boy, not here! Friendly, efficient wait staff; waters and drinks constantly refilled without having to ask, and the kitchen had our orders out all at once and in a timely manner.
     i've eaten at the Cave Creek restaurant a number of times, and consistently had  excellent, friendly service. And the food is GREAT!  Everything i've had there is yummy. Lots of menu choices; hard to choose... i recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. I tried the deep dish pizza and added sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, black olives and extra cheese. The server did warn me it would take 40-50 minutes for the pizza to be done. I did not mind waiting since I love pizza, specially Chicago's deep dish pizza. The pizza came out and it was amazing to say the least. I would recommend this place. The service was excellent and I loved the patio setup. Good tip: Our server recommended the pesto bread with added chicken and it was the most amazing appetizer; it is not on the menu, but the server recommended it so we gave it a try."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I love going to Oregano's. Not just because the food is amazingly delicious. It's because from the second you walk in the door you are greeted with a smile! Every time we have been there it seriously seams like the employees love there job!!!! The manager activity walks around the restaurant and checks on you to make sure you are doing well and helps out when needed. Such a great staff and environment. Never had a bad experience at Oregano's. The food comes out in such large portions and it's priced great! 5 stars for sure on this one and for anyone going there I would recommend that you try the - Alfredo The Dark and add chicken It is so amazing. Also for dessert you have to get the pizza cookie!!! Wonderful job to the staff keep up all the hard work and keep those smiles :)"}
{"text":"Love the food, drinks and  atmosphere. Friendly staff . My favorite is the big rig pasta with chicken the best pasta ever . I had been to other restaurants can not compare:)"}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and I like this pizza. The salads here are yummy too. We have been here a number of times and it does not disappoint. The apps are fun too."}
{"text":"Excellent salad, pizza and wings.   You can't go wrong with anything you order.  Service is what they do, and they do it well.  Whenever friends or family come to town, this is one of those places we always go to!"}
{"text":"Oh wow!  Homey and warm atmosphere friendly to families and with a sense of humor too!  Our server Sean was friendly and warm too, and spent a lot of time getting to know us.  The place was packed at dinner time and we were offered to wait or sit at a high top table for two at the bar.  So glad we did!  It was very comfortable and we felt like we were in our own little booth even though it was not enclosed!  We chose the Big Beefstro and the Oregano's Favorite salads.  The Big Beefstro salad that I ordered was huge and so tasty with strips of rib eye, jalapeños, Romaine, little onions, secret white cheese, cilantro, spinach and topped with crispy onions.  Served with a sweet Serrano pepper lo-fat dressing that made your mouth water!  The Oregano's favorite salad that my wife ordered was also full of flavor with all of her favorites:  Romaine, sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, spiced feta cheese, roasted red peppers and raisins in a honey vinaigrette dressing and topped with red onions.  She added chicken and washed hers down with Blue Moon and I chose a local San Tan beer.  The T-shirts on the staff had hilarious captions on the back:  \"Legalize Marinara\" and \"Nice haboobs\" (have you looked that word up yet?)!  We will be back to this amazing place, an Arizona institution and well-run.  The signs on the walls and especially in the spotless restrooms were so interesting to read that my wife was about to send in a St. Bernard with a keg to rescue me because I had been gone so long!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit, and it was awesome! The food was great and portion sizes were large. The salads looked amazing and stacked! We got the stuffed mushrooms appetizer which was quite tasty. The chicken parmesan was very good too. The best part is the service! Clearly, they work as a team and my iced tea never went empty for more than a minute (and I literally had 5 refills...love the unsweetened passion fruit tea). I would say the customer service was flawless! Thanks fora great dinner!"}
{"text":"It's my first time coming to this location and boy, the ordering and pick up to go is a hot mess. It's at the entrance which is already busy and there is not much of a formed line. I wish they would announce which orders are ready on a speaker so not everyone is waiting in line to just check their order status..i went to pick up and it took me 15+ minutes of standing there waiting to check my order! By the time I got mine, the pizza was just warm. You need patience when ordering..it seems busier than dine in.

Enough on the rant..now onto the food:
-caesar salad: solid. Crisp romaine, shaved and grated parmesan cheese and the perfect dressing coated each bite. I normally don't eat croutons but found myself enjoying those as well. They had a light taste of olive oil and were baked perfectly.

-italian meatball soup: woohoo I got mini meatballs and one giant one! Very tasty and not overly salty. It was a little thicker than expected though and I didn't care for the pizza crust bowl it was served in. The dough tasted bland and was baked. I think maybe a brush of olive oil with italian seasoning may have added a bit more flavor. The crisp flatbread with cheese was a nice accompiment though.

-thin crust pizza: not my fave pizza ever but it's better than the typical chain like bjs. It is very thin crust and is crispy unless you wait too long to eat it..the toppings are generous and weigh down the pie. I wish the pie had cheese then toppings but they seem to place toppings first. 

Overall, I'd return. I had Oreganos at a diff location and it was just as enjoyable, if not more. Only thing I'd like changed is the horrid wait to order or get your take out at the front. They need more staff there to answer phones and operate the register, one to take orders and one to retrieve orders to stream line the process."}
{"text":"My parents are regulars here and I have recently moved closer to this location. When they first opened this location had some issues with food and service and I and decided to drive into town to eat at a location that had been opened longer. Fast forward to last week. We decided to dine in again as I feel that we should be supporting our local economy and lets face it, it is way more convenient. Big mistake. Unfortunately we ran into the same issues, long wait times, past the amount that was projected by over 40 minutes, incorrect food items brought to the table with a server who swore they wrote it down and keyed it in correctly. I really would love to eat here, my family dines out at least three times a week. I just don't understand how the food can be incorrect and under cooked after waiting for so long. It makes the pleasure of dining out a real nightmare. Please, get your stuff together! I love your chains food, your location however needs some work."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was poor. We've been to several Oregano's in AZ and were fairly disappointed with our service. 
We waited 40 minutes for a thin crust cheese pizza as we watched tables that came after us get their orders. Our waitress forgot to add it to our order completely until we asked how much longer the pizza would take. Other than that the food is always hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times. We really LOVE the back patio at this location. The food is pretty good however the take out takes like 45 mins its kind of crazy how long it takes even if you call in to order and pick it up its always 45 mins ??? We will be back to enjoy the back patio again when it cools down."}
{"text":"One of our local favorites. You will NEVER leave here hungry. Portions are large, taste is good, service is fast, and your wallet is NOT empty when you leave. Best pizza around. Huge, huge, huge salads. Meatball sandwich is scrumptious. And while you wait, you can watch old Lone Ranger or Ozzie and Harriet episodes. Give Oregano's a try."}
{"text":"What's not to love?! Great food and the best Chicago-stuffed deep dish pizza in the Valley. 

Immediately upon walking in the door, we were greeted by friendly staff at the host stand. My buddy and I were immediately sat at a table on the patio and our server Rebecca arrived within a minute to get our drinks. Rebecca was friendly, knowledgeable, outgoing and helpful. She mastered the fine line of being attentive without hovering. 

One of the Managers stopped by to check in on us as well. She was friendly and kind and ensured we were having a great experience. 

That's a magic combo; great food, great service and friendly staff. Come check it out for yourself and ask for Rebecca. She'll keep you hydrated and smiling."}
{"text":"Orgeno's home of the \"angry jazz\" and on this night it appears angry server. I mean I get we came in an hour before closing but come on. It was an hour. 

Had calamari to start.  Was good but really nothing beats the cheesy bread and the artichoke dip. My friend and I split the Pablo Picasso salad and the pasta with the chicken and southwestern type of sauce. Sorry can't remember the name. Was all very yummy but our disgruntled waitress left us thirsty. 

Food is consistent here which I love. The jazz drives me nuts but not enough that I order to go. Hope that waitress has a better tomorrow."}
{"text":"Always yummy. 
The Picasso salad and pasta. Was super tasty. 
Our waitress was very cranky."}
{"text":"We ordered the thin crust, Numerous Uno pizza.    Maybe was a little undercooked.  We like the crust to be a little more crispy.  Our order was for pickup so the might of had something to do with the ... Not so crispy crust.   We also ordered the Caesar salad with chicken added and the antipasto salad... The salads were excellent.  Overall, it was very good and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"If your idea of fun dining is to wait 40 minutes in a crowded, noisy place for an overpriced slice of pizza then you'll like Oregano's. I'd rate it higher if I didn't have to withstand the aural and visual onslaught of Tempe visitors who can't be bothered to look anywhere else for a meal, and that's sad considering how much this town has to offer.  On occasions when coworkers insist on going, I do enjoy their salads."}
{"text":"Oreganos is delicious!  The salad with the beef on it is my favorite. And the pizza cookie for dessert is fantastic. My husband always gets the pasta with sausage. It's so much food. You will have leftovers."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great Chicago style pizza, this is the place to go! The atmosphere here is excellent and they have a decent selection of wine and beer, especially or a pizza joint. Our server was Marissa and she was excellent! We ordered the Guaca-Tony, which is basically homemade guacamole and their \"chips\", which is more like a chip pizza...it was fantastic!

Highly recommended for pizza!,"}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner here last night. Great food and fun place to take friends and family. Service was timely and drinks are good! Definitely a fun place to go for dinner!"}
{"text":"Went there when was in town for Parents Weekend at ASU's business school.  My niece, nephew and his girlfriend who all live there recommended this place.  First went to another Oregano's which was too crowded, so ended up at this one.  The place was still packed, but was able to get a drink and sit on the outside patio in the 100 weather at night!  Not sure how you deal with that weather all the time.  FInally got in after a 40 minute wait, but the pizza and pasta was really good!  Because we were not in any rush, didn't mind the wait, but in future would never wait that long."}
{"text":"The food is always wonderful--and portions are huge (always leave with enough leftovers for another meal.) I am so happy Yelp offers a waitlist now--because the biggest obstacle to us frequenting there more is the long wait."}
{"text":"I love the food here! The pizzas are second to none, the gold wings are incredible, and the pastas are amazing. To top it off, the service here is always awesome. I'm come here anytime I'm in the area. Five stars!!"}
{"text":"Had Abby on Wednesday she was great! Was super helpful with the menu and she kept my drinks full which I am a stickler for!  She is my new favorite!  I don't want anyone else."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! it always comes out fresh and hot and fast. today we're going to do take out instead instead of sit down and we had to change the order and they had no problem with that.  they are pleasant  on the phone and they are pleasant in person. our food came out delicious and hot and we cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a group from meet-up on Tuesday Aug 29, 2017.  Our server, Sam, was fantastic and with 18 people he did not make one mistake.

My review is about the food.  I had the Pablo Picasso salad with beans and it was good but so large and the plate they serve it in has no room to toss, stir or otherwise mix up the ingredients and the dressing.  Why doesn't Oregano's serve their salads in larger bowls so they are easier to eat.  

So kudos to Sam, our server however they way the salads are served needs some revisions."}
{"text":"Ordered a lasagna to-go and while the flavor was definitely there, the size and pasta definitely was not (tasted like more meat and marinara than pasta/cheese). In fact I was still hungry after finishing--something that never happens when I eat lasagna!

Their saving grace is the thin crust pizza which is amazing and the chicken Caesar salad. I'll come back for those items. 

Beware: The wait for a table can be long--we're talking a full hour on a Wednesday night. Best solution is to order to-go."}
{"text":"I recently checked out Oregano's at it's new location. I am so thrilled that this new space is much more spacious that the previous location. I came here for Lunch during the week and as always there was a slight wait. The wait wasn't that long, but as you wait they offer you free samples of pizza. As you walk through the Restaurant, pretty much every employee greets you. It doesn't seem cheezy either. It made my feel happy to  be greeted so nicely. Needless to say, the staff was fantastic and service was prompt and efficient. If you order a fountain type beverage, you get what looks like a 32 oz cup. I seriously needed two hands to drink from it and never needed a refill. For eats, we ordered the large dinner Salad and the BBQ Chicken Pizza on Whole Wheat Thin Crust.
The Salad- pretty basic but adequate.
The Pizza- Was disappointed in the whole wheat crust. I know it's hard to get right and they haven't got there quite yet.  The crust was too crispy and sometimes burnt in places. Besides that, the Pizza was still enjoyable. It had the right portions of everything. 
Look forward to returning again."}
{"text":"Oregano's has a classy, blast-from-the-past feel to it.  The music, staff and camaraderie the restaurant provides is great for enjoying a delicious meal.  I recommend their lunch special's chicken caesar salad and \"heck of a slice.\"  Oregano's is a great restaurant I wish I had discovered sooner! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"i will never go back there!!!!! there is a thief on staff there!!!!! left my purse, called them within 10 min. was told my purse was there.... it wasn't!!!!! what a shame i really liked the food & the bartender remembered what i drank..... ladies watch your purses guys watch your billfolders!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have only one question...why isn't there an Oreganos in my city? Great atmosphere, great service and incredible food. Bucca schmucca. We eat here every time we are in the area. I dont have a negative!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I am a thin-crust kind of gal and Oregano's is the best IMO.  I always take my out-of-town guests there and they seem to agree.  Oregano's never disappoints.  As an added bonus, their patio is dog-friendly so I am able to take my fur-baby whenever the weather permits.  First we do some browsing in Cave Creek and then we head to Oregano's.  I get my thin-crust pizza and she gets her chicken breast.  Win-win-win!  

P.S.  Their salads are delicious but huge.  Plan on splitting up to 4 ways..."}
{"text":"Authentic decor and cozy atmosphere with great food choices! The pizzas and sandwiches come highly recommended. You can get the pizzas stuffed (Chicago style), thin or pan with simple and unique combinations! I also recommend the meatball sandwich with fries. It's a lot of food and you'll have yummy leftovers. The cookie icecream dessert is very good if you're looking for a sweet after meal delight. The service is very friendly."}
{"text":"After bad food last night this was awesome!

Quick service. The manager brought our food herself. It was great. We had bolla pasta and Alfredo the dark. Three of us also split a house salad that was huge. They sent a refill to go for tomorrow night of pasta. Price was very reasonable

It was a wonderful experience and wish we had gone here the night before as well."}
{"text":"Before heading to ASU Gammage Theatre, we stopped in for dinner at 5:30 pm. Indoors was fully occupied and there were lots of empty tables on the patio. Sa I don't it was a we minute wait for indoor seating, so we come to see in the patio area. But when our hostess came back with to seat us, she told us there were seats with the high chairs/tables. Whew!!! It would have been a scorcher sitting in the sun. The umbrellas were of no use with the sun setting 'cause the umbrella stand doesn't bend.
We had the 18\" Clark Meat Pizza on a thin crust and a big Julius salad which is served nice and cold along with cold plates. The salad was fresh and crisp;  the pizza with just the right amount of meat came out hot and full of flavor.
Matt was our server who doubled as a bartender and was helpful and personable along with the other staff.
In the future.we wouldn't mind coming later for dinner, but I don't know if I could wait an hour to be seated.
There was ample parking on the side and back of the building as hen we left at 6:30 PM."}
{"text":"Stopped by a couple of nights ago at 6:30 PM and had to wait 50 minutes.They just don't have enough seats for us waiting patrons . So, we stood for about 30 minutes before we found seats in the waiting area. While waiting, they brought out complimentary pieces of cheese pizza. I've never had that happen before. When we finally got seated, it was difficult trying to read the menu that had red lettering. Good thing our friend had a flashlight. We had the thin crust pIzza and Caesar salad. With all the good food they serve, waiting in line for 50 minutes was nothing We've tried all the different locations and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"As always Oreganos never disappoints!! Ordered the Cesar salad with chicken and it was divine. Perfect. I am always satisfied when I come here for a family meal regardless of whether we dine in or pick up. This is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley. Customer service is top notch."}
{"text":"I was in town for a Spartan Race and needed to load up on carbs and found Oregano's. The place is popular and was crowded when I stopped by, so I decided to get take out. The service was great, even when they were busy. I decided on the Roasted Garlic Chicken Lasagna, took it back to the hotel and feasted. It was delicious! It came with toasted garlic bread and the staff made sure I had Parmesan cheese and plastic ware. Prices are good and the serving size was generous."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's been a family favorite for years and years. Amazing thin and deep dish pizza! Ginormous, tasty salads! The kick butt cheesy garlic bread is to die for. This spot is a can't miss!"}
{"text":"In my opinion the pasta is mismatched to the sauce. I ordered the Lady is a Scampi which has shrimp and a lite oil based sauce... this should be paired with Angel Hair... Oreganos version came with cavatappi. I know that seems nit picky, but when you pay $15+ for an entree you expect more than a whole bowl of cheap pasta."}
{"text":"Here's the problem:  on the drive to Oregano's, the driver said this was \"the best pizza in the universe\" and he should know because he \"used to be a chef.\"  Emphasis on the \"used to be.\"  The first clue why I should've discounted his opinion: he now was driving a shuttle.  It's all beginning to make sense.

This place is small...very small.  The bar was ear-piercingly loud with most of the patrons screaming to be heard over the other patrons.  The variety of beer on tap, the good appetizers, the young lady offering free samples of cheese pizza and...the outdoor seating area, made the long wait for a table--albeit on a friday night--tolerable.  Both the bomb spinach-artichoke dip and the portabella mushrooms were very good.  Pass on the bruschetta.  It was mediocre at best.

When we were seated, we quickly placed our order and salads arrived to the tables soon thereafter.  If you're ordering pizza, you understand there will be a wait before your pizza is ready.  The wait wasn't long, but it's what we expected for the three pizzas we ordered.  

The pizzas were good, but not the best \"in the universe\" as had been described.  If you like thin crust pizza, you'll probably love this place.  The everything pizza with a thin crust was good.  The cheeseburger pizza with the pickles, hamburger and lettuce was just odd.  I did not enjoy it.  The chicago-style deep dish with sausage and pepperoni was good--but it was not anywhere near the caliber of a Giordano's or a Chicago Fire Pizza (Folsom, CA).

When in Scottsdale, I may return, but it will not be at this Oregano's primarily because of the small size.  And my expectations will be a little lower; so, maybe I'll change the rating on my next visit.  Stay tuned."}
{"text":"The pizza is good with a variety of flavor combinations. The crust is thin. At times it can be a little too thin and crunchy to over cooked. The best thing is the pizza cookie with ice cream. It comes warm and soft with a crunchy outside. One of the best cookie desserts around."}
{"text":"Here's the thing - Oregano's has a cute marketing campaign and full restaurants. I guess their food is pretty good, but off the top of my head I can think of 15 other restaurants with better pizza. However, it has become my go-to place for out-of-town guests. I do not understand why, but I have yet to take a non-AZ friend there who has not gone crazy for Oreganos.

I like the Mesa restaurant because it is the only location that does not have huge weight times. In fact, one night I took a friend there and it was almost empty! 

Whatever location you choose, save room for the cookie dessert. Your guests will love it."}
{"text":"A cheerful crew, and hot Arizona ambiance greets you as you enter the world of Oregano's in Tempe. We started off on the right foot with their famous cheese bread (which was killer) and artichoke dip to die for. The brakes, for me, came with the pasta entree. A pesto and penne creation baked and smothered in cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. All served up nice in a bread bowl. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver for me. But, those I was dining with seemed uber-impressed with their signature thin crust pizza.

Redemption came with a PIZOKIE on a level I have never experienced. Those of you who have had the fortune to experience a BJ's pizokie will be blown away hands-down by the Oregano Pizokie. Thick, lucious, and chocolatey...covered in vanilla ice cream. Pure chocolate cookie end-of-meal destruction."}
{"text":"I don't come out to Arizona a lot but when I do, I have to visit Oregano's. The pizza is amazing, the wings are awesome, and the desserts are unbelievable. Recommend this place 6 times out of 5"}
{"text":"Everyone should have a pazooki here! I've never had a bad meal here and always have leftovers."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza marguerite and guacamole appetizer was big and excellent and as always the cookie dessert was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Nice waitress, but pasta alfredo was dry, had to ask for more sauce. Sauce wasn't warm when she brought it, so had to wait some more. Next day heated up was not good. Very oily. Stick to the pizza."}
{"text":"My first Time at this oreganos location.  This one wasn't as great at the one in Scottsdale and the lunch special pizza wasn't as good.  Don't know why, but the salad was still great."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal there. The appetizers are great, especially the Brussel Sprouts. The pizzas and pastas are all phenomenal. The drink choices are varied and excellent and a pizza cookie for dessert?! Done. Best place in Goodyear."}
{"text":"Love this place-great salad and pizza and Bellini and make sure to save room for dessert!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Understaffed. Manager unsympathetic. 1/2 hour wait for a bud light because manager would not change the keg. One bartender should be 2. Food over one hour wait. Not busy as no wait. Previously a favorite place. Will consider other options in the future."}
{"text":"Service, Italian wedding soup, and ambience are great but the wait is looonnnnng.  Pizza was way too salty and the food is over-priced by a mile."}
{"text":"Stopped in Wednesday around noon and this place is poppin. Got greeted, got sat. Ordered drinks app and lunch. Our server Alexis was not only attentive to our meal but was sunny and happy. Lunch was spaced perfectly, drinks refilled with zero wait, food quality was great. All with a smile. Great experience, thank you."}
{"text":"Oreganos pizza and salads are consistently great. My husband and I always get a house salad and Lawrence original thin crust. After 15 years, we've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I've been to Oregano's on many occasions in the past. You can essentially expect the same service and food quality regardless of the location. They have a pretty extensive menu, offering pizza, pasta, and salads. My wife loves the basic \"bowl-o-pasta\"- choose your pasta type and the sauce that covers it (meat sauce is great). I've always been fond of the Pablo Picasso salad. This time I ordered it seems as though it had changed a bit- they added diced (fresh) jalapenos so that adds a lot of extra heat (I don't remember that from previous versions of the salad). The portions are huge so bring an appetite- even the \"junior\" that I ordered was massive and basically unfinishable (new word). 

There's a great menu for the kids, lots to choose from and a decent price. Oregano's always has great beers on tap and a decent wine menu. Our server was attentive but not stalking, and knew the menu well. We did order to baked ravioli and they were not very good. It tasted like it was all breading with a little bit of spicy cheese baked into the middle. I would skip those next time around. 

With 2 adult meals, a glass of wine, a pint of beer, the app, a kids meal & a 20% tip we walked away $60 lighter. The restaurant is a little on the noisy side so be prepared to shout or simply stare at each other (they play Sinatra-themed music over the loudspeakers). 

Good food, great service, full menu, and a decent drink menu keeps me coming back to Oregano's. They do offer good lunch menus, and can get them out to you quickly if you're in a rush. The lunch crowds are large here..."}
{"text":"This is our goto restaurant when the family wants to eat Italian food. Someone always gets the big rig with the sausage, a meat pizza, spaghetti and meatballs, and other great stuff. I never leave disappointed. The only reason why this doesn't get five stars is because of parking. I have never found a spot closer than a quarter-mile away. The competition for family restaurants and bars is great, and that eats into the available parking spaces. We don't mind though. We will definitely be back again. 
EDIT:
We're back!  
Picked up a couple of salads and garlic cheese bread for lunch.  The antipasto and pablo Picasso Mexican salads were HUGE!  We could only eat a third of each salad. This is my neighbor hood Italian food  joint."}
{"text":"Everything was so awesome! There wasn't even a wait! We got our wings in about 10 minutes and our pizza right after (which was amazing). Our server Colleen was so great! She continued to check on us and even got us Pepsis to go! Our experience tonight was incredible. I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!
The food was delicious!
The restaurant is super clean.
Kristen is one of the best servers In Arizona.
This is my new favorite restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I eat here every time we come to Phoenix. I always ask for the waiter Kinzer Messenger. The brussels sprouts are the best on earth! Love their tall beers."}
{"text":"Food was consistent with the other Oreganos in town. The staff was attentive. Parking was terrible."}
{"text":"The place smells amazing when you walk in.
And there is a huge mound of mints and fortune cookies at the hostess stand.

The hostess and bartender were super friendly and helpful!

I went there specifically for their dessert, the pizza cookie pizookie? I didn't realize there were different cookie options like white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter/chocolate, chocolate chip and salted caramel. I was even able to, at the bartender's suggestion, get 2 different flavors, half and half. The menu suggested that it's  a dessert for 2-4 people. I think more like 2. I got it for just myself and ate a little over half. It was so good! Less than $6. Not a bad price for a large dessert. 

I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I will start at the beginning: We arrived about 130pm and we're told a 15-20 minute wait for the 2 of us. We are waiting in a very small area with groups of 4-7, some with small children. While we are waiting I noticed several open tables that sit 2, when I asked the hostess if those tables were available she told me that she had to go down her list.  We were the only couple in the waiting area and about 5th on the list. We were finally shown to the tables that had been empty for the past 15 mins. 

Our server was Madison, we decided on our sandwiches. I got my sandwich with potato chips  and a side of mayo my husband requested the Italian Fried Potatoes with his sandwich. When our sandwiches came my husband had sweet potato fries instead of the Italian Fries. When we questioned Madison she didn't seem to know what Italian Fried Potatoes were and asked if he wanted waffle fries. We looked at a menu to see if we were wrong this is what is in the menu:

 SWAP OUT THE HOMEMADE POTATO CHIPS FOR  ITALIAN-FRIED POTATOES OR SWEET PO'S FOR SOME EXTRA DOUGH.

Madison said the waffle fries WERE the Italian Fried potatoes.  My husband asked for those. I asked for my side of mayo. We were half finished with our sandwiches when we received the waffle fries and my mayo. 

My husband then asked if they had any malt vinegar or regular white vinegar. Madison had no clue what we were asking for. When my husband explained that they make vinaigrette dressings they used vinegar and if we could just get a little of the vinegar. She brought back some balsamic vinaigrette  dressing. 

Now to the food: I had the beef and my husband had the turkey both were very good. The waffle fries and the potato chips had a burnt oil taste to them. I think they needed to change the oil as it was old. 

Our drinks were not refilled nor were asked if we wanted a refill till after we received our check. 

I think the crew for this restaurant is young and needs to have additional training. The hostess station certainly needs more than one person when the wait area is packed with people. We should not have to wait for larger parties to be seated. Especially, when there were tables available that only sat 2. 

There are so many great restaurants in the Superstion Area and having an Oregano's in the area was a bonus. My fear is if you don't correct minor issues they will turn into a bigger problem."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. Waited about 30-40 minutes to be seated. Food and service was great. The waiter made sure water was always available. One of the curious thing is that their Tv's are shown black and white movies!!super fun and original. The music were classics and at a volume that you are able to enjoy it and at the same time talk to whomever you are with without being bother by it."}
{"text":"I must suggest the El Diablo Shrimp Pasta. It definitely packs the heat but with tons of flavor. Very authentic. Oh...and it's best washed down with a Sangria Blanco or two ;-)

This was my first time at Oregano's. I went with a couple friends for a friend's birthday dinner (at her request).  The service was fast, courteous, & friendly. It has a great family/neighborly vibe with very positive & fun energy of the staff. 

It does get busy really fast so if you have a large group I would strongly suggest getting there early or making reservations.

Be sure to save room for the Pizza Cookie w/Ice Cream."}
{"text":"it's a 4.5 star place.

really good casual italian place. salads are pretty much can't miss, and i love the clark street pizza.

but for something in this space, it needs the \"you MUST try\" dish to get five stars. while almost everything on the menu is really good, there's nothing life-changing about it."}
{"text":"I really like the food that I've tried so far. I've eaten the calamari (fried perfectly), mini deep dish pizza (OMG), pizza cookie (delish), and stuffed pizza (the best imo). 

By no means am I an expert on authentic Italian food, but I am an expert on Customer Service, it's my field of work. The customer service at this location is great. I will say when I first attempted to visit here I wanted to call in my order, but I kept being told the wait would be over an hour or two. I finally got ahold of the manager and she made everything right and even treated me to lunch. 

When I come in I feel like everyone is so happy and helpful. Also I don't even try to call my order in. I walk in and place my order and the wait is only about 10-15 min if even that long. The food is always hot and fresh.

I'd highly recommend giving them a try if for nothing at least the pizza."}
{"text":"I am giving Oreganos a 4/5 only because I wish their restaurant was bigger and their wait times were shorter. Sometimes we have to pass on this amazing restaurant because we simply can't wait 2 hours to eat. However, the prices are really reasonable. I get the big rig pasta almost every time! I can't resist it. The atmosphere is really great and friendly for family get togethers or a date night. Their service is always wonderful and they always get your order right! It is my favorite restaurant on the west side of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My work got some Christmas allowance and instead of doing a dinner we decided to get a really nice lunch for our branch. We decided on Oregano's cause it was on the way. 

I had the stuffed Italian sandwich and it blew my mind. I couldn't believe how bug this sandwich was, it provided me with two wonderful lunches. 

It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldn't even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much. 

After that experience I am going to make more of an effort to get to the restaurant instead of getting it to go."}
{"text":"It was just okay, not great but not horrible I'm not sure if it was worth the wait. I'll try it again later on to see if maybe it gets better but the only thing I enjoyed was their cheese bread."}
{"text":"TURN DOWN THE MUSIC. It is impossible to have a conversation. Food is great. Service is good. We go on off times because then noise of people yelling over the music."}
{"text":"What's not to love? First off I would certainly tell anyone ordering the salads that they feed 2 people. They are HUGE! And all of them are delicious.
I love the El Diablo Shrimp Pasta plate and would highly recommend this dish to anyone who is not timid of spicy food or enormous size shrimp. Alfredo The Dark is another hit! And a must try is the Stuffed Pies they are fabulous. The Surprise location has a great patio for outdoor dining in the cooler months in AZ! I also frequent the Tempe location as it is near my job and the food quality at both locations are on point. Love this place."}
{"text":"Worst oreganos ive ever ate in, 
restaurant is dirty and depressing...
salad was horrible the pizza we couldn't eat it was so bad , go somewhere else save your $"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a very good Caesar salad the Julius Caesar and Oregano's makes is king. Now I'm a big guy that can put away a lot of food but I can't finish the large's Julius Cesar salad. It is that large but it's so good. I recommended anybody that is a salad lover. 

With that said I find the restaurant always very loud. The booths tend to be a little bit small so if you're big you're going to want to find a table but overall this is a very good place to eat. It's wonderful for the kids they have doughballs that the kids can play with."}
{"text":"I'm a longtime Oregano's customer and have enjoyed lunch there often. Today was the exception. Oregano's, which opens at 11:00 a.m., has a \"Midday Rush\" menu that includes a \"Heckuva Slice.\"  One would interpret a \"Midday Rush\" menu as quick service. Not today. We arrived a little before 11:00 a.m. and both ordered a slice of pizza and didn't get served until 11:36 a.m. We watched as orders \"to go\" were being boxed before the orders for in-house customers were served. Hey Oregano's - The changes that have been made in the past year, such as charges for fries with sandwiches and loss of focaccia bread, were disappointing but understandable. The outrageously bad management today really isn't."}
{"text":"I love oreganos. I've been several times, it's always great! The Alfredo the dark is my favorite!  The Pabalo Picasso salad is excellent. Love the pizza too, my husband LOVES the hot wings.  If you have never been you must go you will not regret it. The service is also great."}
{"text":"Don't let the wait scare you its worth it.  I love Alfredo the Dark and add the Italian sausage for a little protein.  Stuffed pizzas are always a hit.  The servers are great and its always a fun environment with great food."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their services my order take 2 hours to make... by the time they are finish making our food we had already fed up with their service did not offer water for the two hours wait... people after people came in to pick up their  orders ... our order was a small one not even a huge one terrible experience. Would not come back here... the location is in Scottsdale i thought it would be better then any other places.  Terrible terrible service."}
{"text":"I love the fried jalapeno ravioli!  Luana did such a wonderful job of taking care of us! I got there to late for the deep dish pizza's but the thin crust wasn't bad. ove the cookie!"}
{"text":"Food is consistently delicious, service is consistently mediocre. I come here often for the food(hard to find good Italian in arizona) and I always order the simple bollo pasta and house salad. The pasta sauce and homemade Italian dressing are SO GOOD they have kept me coming back for years and years. The staff is friendly but the over all service is not great. There are some waiters/ bartenders that are better but the majority of them take your order and bring the check, never checking on if you'd like another drink or if everything taste ok. Also I feel that as the brand has expanded through the valley they have lost a little bit of their original quality."}
{"text":"Management was super rude. I addressed a concern and the response was, \"That's how it is...\"

You're better off going to Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Oregano's is a popular spot in the area. Wait time can range from 30 minutes to an hour for a table for 4. The food is delicious here and they're very generous with their serving size. The pizza is always a go to at Oregano's and a small size is usually suffice for 2 people. 

The salads are huge and for the price it's a great deal. I had it for dinner and there was enough leftovers for lunch the next day. I recommend the southwestern salad. Last time I asked the waiter to separate the dressing but the kitchen made the mistake of mixing it in the salad. The waiter was very accommodating and even offer a free dessert item to make up for their mistake. 

I would give them another star but they dropped the ball again later that night. When my friend handed the waiter his credit card for his bill they somehow lost his card on the way to the register. I'm not sure how. Maybe it slipped out the book and someone picked it up because we wait an additional 10 minutes and it was nowhere to be found. Forgetting to separate the salad dressing was not a big issue but losing a credit card is dangerous."}
{"text":"Love this place amazing pizza and salads and u have to get the pizzookie while ur here I would say try it just once but ud never be able to stay away and oh yeah the service is just as great"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Oregano's!!! One of my favs! Great food, wonderful service,  fun environment....and did I mention the infamous pazookie?!?AmAzIng!! 

Everything  I have tried is great! It's so hard for me to venture because I'm OBSESSED with the Pablo Picasso salad! I love going with friends so I can sneak bites of their food...oregano's favorite salad, bistro classic pizza, guacatony...it's all good!"}
{"text":"Wow.. Found this little gem by chance driving by New Years Day after 5-hours driving back from Laguna.. If you are like the mom-n-pop places opposed to chains.. This staid charmer will keep you a loyal customer. I had salad w the guacamole starter which BTW comes w crispy cheesey garlicy flatbread pizza.. I honestly can't remember Italian food tasting so darn good!! Place is packed & they offer curbside delivery.. Just because they love their customers & want them to be happy..How cool is that??;-)) Jack and Shirley still own this gem and they even gave me a free cookie.for giving them a try.. Did I mention this huge warm-out-ya-the-oven cookie come sealed in its own little tin.. with Ice-cream!!! Who knew??"}
{"text":"This is the place to go! Great food and service around the board! The big rig pasta is a rigatoni pasta with a spicy creamy tomato sauce. I strongly suggest that you add their sausage. It will never disappoint you with the flavor or spice! Don't forget their Pazooki, which is the half baked cookie with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. Our kids order it every visit."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza was fair but the next day left overs did not taste good. Will consider trying something other than pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's always good.
Tonight was no different.
Service was quick and fast, which was good for a busy evening.
We always get the same pizza as we love it so much (Numero Uno) as well as the antipasto salad. A side of meatballs and some wings as appetizers (there was 5 of us) and we were good to go."}
{"text":"Alright so I have to confess ... we have been knuckleheads since we moved her a couple of years ago.  We have walked and driven by Oregano's several times. Many of the locations but particularly the one on Dobson and Germann in Chandler. Many friends have recommended it but we seen to get stuck in ruts and go to the same places. Well lucky for us, this time we decided to give it a try. Wow! Well now we know that for sure that we will be back. Starting with service, we arrived just as Sean was coming in shift and he sat us in his section. That was a very fortunate break for us. He was very personable, professional and most importantly helpful. He guided us through the menu and provided a couple of suggestions for salad and entree. As he explained the servings are huge so we ordered one to share and also a salad to share. His suggestions were spot in for us.  The flavors are interesting with the mix of fresh Italian ingredients and some really nice Mexican spices like chipotle and poblanos. The spice is just enough for a nice little kick and not overpowering at all. Best of all we were able to enjoy the leftovers the next day and they were still awesome. The only down side is the entire area has parking limitations as there are a few restaurants nearby.  So for us the final grades are service A++ for Sean, food A+ for freshness, flavor and serving size, atmosphere A."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times...

Once I discovered the Alfredo The Dark, and have that about every time now.  Always a good experience!"}
{"text":"Called this location (I usually go to Gilbert but this one is closer) and wanted to know the wait and since the Yelp app was \"doing something funky\" and the male on the phone put me on hold and came and said oh it's nothing we can do. So what's up? WHAT'S UP??? I called back to let the manager know but I'm sure he is still there collecting a check."}
{"text":"I cannot profess my love for Oregano's enough. It's the closest thing to the stuffed and thin crust pizzas I grew up eating in Chicago that you can get in the Valley. The sauce is perfect,, the toppings and cheese are wonderful, and the dough is excellent. 

I don't typically find myself at the Camelback location since I live close to old town Scottsdale.  But yesterday I had a craving and decided to order from there and pick it up on my way to work (this location is much closer to there). Had an 8\" Sprocolli which I nearly finished off myself when I made it to work. 

The only thing I am disappointed in was the wait. I got to the restaurant and went to the pickup area. I guess one of the customers ahead of me had some sort of an issue, because it took a lot longer than I expected to pick up the pizza. But the staff was so friendly when I finally made it to the register, that I couldn't even hold it against them."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Chicagoland area. This is by far the closet thing to Chicago style pizza I've had anywhere outside of there. Whether you have the thin crust or the stuffed, you're eating some of the best pizza in the valley. I've dined at several of their locations, and can't say enough about how good it is. 

And save room for desert. The Pizookie is fantastic. I highly recommend the peanut butter chocolate chip. 

There is one negative. 
If you decide to have something other than the pizza, be warned. The sandwich and pasta portions are huge, and make for lousy leftovers. They never seem to reheat well."}
{"text":"This worked so well. It was the first time I used Yelp.  I will definitely use it again.  Oreganos was awesome as usual 
 When we arrived it was 10 minutes before the time yelp gave us.  The hostess said it could be up to a 25 minute wait.  20 minutes later we were seated"}
{"text":"Lived in Chicago my whole life so I know pizza. We always order the super thin Chicago style crust and while it technically is not Chicago style pizza, it is certainly a whole lot better than any of the other pizza joints we have tried in the Phoenix area. We have eaten there about 7 times and the pizza is always what we were looking for - very thin crust to cut down on carbs. For sure, this place is almost always busy - never go on a weekend or dinner time ..... we go mid-afternoon and get seated right away. Food always comes pretty quick and staff is always friendly - no complaints there. For being in the neighborhood it is our go-to pizza joint. However, if you want really good pizza - Jackie Boyz Pizza in Dewey-Humbolt. Pizza and meatballs are great - small, family owned place. Check it out."}
{"text":"Oregano's has great food! and plenty of it! It's definitely a place to take the family because the appetizers and food are big portions. 

Also the service was very kind and friendly. I had no problem with ordering or asking for any accommodations. 

The only thing I think one is to be aware is that the parking is in the back. This place is not worth missing!"}
{"text":"I tried to order a pie like a Malnati. I couldn't get the thick beautiful fresh sauce on the top. Now I am not expecting them to make the pizza the same but if you've had Malanti's the dough is cooked more. 

Perhaps I would recommend the stuffed pie instead so it might be easier to eat.

Not a fan of oregano on the pizza either.

The Caesar salad with chicken was actually the star of the show. The pizza was definitely good, but the salad was awesome.

The value for what you pay and what you get is actually very good. You won't leave here feeling you wish your plate was delivered with more food.  Very good quantities."}
{"text":"Excellent menu, great portions, friendly service. Chicken parm was a delight. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Holy Hernandez this place is amazing!  Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Oregano's has upbeat and attentive young servers - servers who actually seem happy to be there!  This always is a plus in dining out.

Our delicious thin crust pizza with sundried tomatoes, pepperoni, mushrooms, (your choice of toppings) was one of the best I've had in the valley.  I loved the chicken Caesar salad which was superior to most -  it was topped with pulled chicken, shaved parmesan slices and a tangy Caesar dressing.

Oregano's is a comfy upbeat restaurant with great service and great food - an excellent time was had by all!"}
{"text":"First timer: the salad was delicious we had the anti pasta salad and it's enough for 4 by itself. The pizza was a thin crust numero uno and was very good. I would definitely return!

Andy"}
{"text":"This is my favorite italian restaurant in town! My fiance and I came here tonight and sat at the bar because it was too busy to sit at a tables. We usually sit at the tables but sitting at the bar tonight we had the best experience! Our bartenders/servers was amazing! Our drinks were never empty and were made to perfection! Our food came out quickly and didn't disappoint. Courtney and Carolyn make an amazing team behind the bar. Courtney was very attentive, checking to make sure are drinks were always full, and we had everything we needed for our food, such as extra dressing and  silverware. We never had to wait. They were on top of their game. I would highly recommend going to Oreganos and sitting at the bar when those two are working. What an awesome experience! Try the long islands...they are amazing!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Oreganos for years. They have the best deep dish pizza I have ever had. The pizza is made from scratch so it usually takes about 45 minutes, but it's well worth the wait. This restaurant is extremely popular so there is usually a wait for a table anyways, and they will let you put your pizza order in early. 

In addition to the deep dish pizza, they also have some excellent thin crust pizzas as well, most of them are very unique but excellent. I also really like their Pablo Picasso salad. It is a hearty salad that is topped with chicken, cheese, onions, chips, etc. The full size salad is huge! I can hardly ever finish it. They also have amazing garlic cheese bread. I miss their big ol' ravioli, it used to be my favorite, please bring it back! And please expand to San Diego! There isn't any good pizza here!!

Make sure you save room for the pazooki! They offer giant half-baked cookies topped with ice cream OMG! To die for!"}
{"text":"It was okay.  I love my chicken parm... pizza and pasts, but everything I tried was just okay.  I will say that the hot cookie & ice cream to finish up the meal was awesome!

Service, 4 stars
Decor, 3 stars
Food, 2 stars

averages out to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Tonight was near perfect.  Found a parking spot immediately.  We were seated right away on the patio.  Service was great and the food came quick.  Pepperoni thin crust was great and the wings were awesome as always.  Medium-Gold is the way to go and at $8.49 for 14 jumbo drums, they can't be beat."}
{"text":"This Oregano's is right around the corner from my house & for about six months after I moved here, it was my go to pizza place. 

As of now, Oregano's just makes me crazy. The pizza is good & the Chicago style pizza is really good, as is the lasagna, but it is not good enough to wait over an hour for a table for. On weeknights the wait seems to be around an hour-ish & on the weekends, especially when the weather is remotely nice, the wait can be three or more hours. I just got tired of it. Very few restaurants are worth a time investment like that & Oregano's just isn't in that league."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service by a wait staff from managers to bussing they genuinely look like they love their job and those they work with so the vibe was great. FOOD was awesome, kids meals reasonable(super nice to our kids too), Italian sandwiches huge and very tasty. Signed up for a free cookie ice cream thru their website/Kaboom site..got it same meal. Yum."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in the west valley! A tad of a wait but who cares... The food is so good. A+ in my book."}
{"text":"My husband's co-worker told us we had to go to Oregano's on our recent trip to Scottsdale. We were in luck when we found out there was one just a few miles from our hotel. It was 117 degrees outside, so the seat inside was very welcome, until we had gotten used to it, and then the 82 degrees the thermostat was set at wasn't so awesome anymore.

Portions are ginormous and the food was really tasty. Highly recommend the cheesy garlic bread and my husband loved the Dirty Monkey (cocktail)! Next time we're in Scottsdale, I know we'll be sure to eat there at least once!"}
{"text":"I ate here with friends after attending the Phoenix Open.  We sat outside on the patio (they had a bunch of heaters so it wasn't super cold).  The atmosphere has a warm, vintage feel.  The lights strong up make it cozy and romantic.  The service was very good, and prompt.  We shared a thin crust pepperoni, garlic and basil pizza and a dinner salad.  The dinner salad was HUGE - enough for all of us to share and have left overs - and very reasonably priced.  The house balsamic dressing was really good.  Nice and tart.  The pizza was delicious as well.  We all found ourselves over eating due to how tasty it was.  The large easily fed three people with left overs to take home.  I would eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! Wait time once we were seated was almost an hour though. Tried to order a take out for my husband and was told thin crust oven was broke - so no go??  Service wasn't anything special. Disappointing to say the least. Lucky they have amazing food!!!  Lady is a Scampi is amazing! .. And can't beat the cookie dessert"}
{"text":"Recently moved back to AZ and Oregano's is one of those places you have to go to almost immediately. AZ natives want it to go national, but we don't. We kinda like keeping the secret amongst ourselves! Everything I've ever tasted from the menu is worthy of ordering. Even when I went thru a strict vegetarian stage I found tasty food. Wasn't a huge fan of their sangria so I'll stick w the beer specials next time I return."}
{"text":"Man do I know how to make an entrance. I walked in Oregano's today and nearly fell on my butt because my sandals apparently disagreed with the floor  Good news is only half the restaurant saw. I recovered gracefully and the waitress made sure I was not too embarrassed. The decor in here is awesome from old bikes to things mounted from the ceiling. Tons to look at at keep the kids busy while waiting for your food. Service was amazing from the get go and since we had never been before the waitress told us a bit about the history of the restaurant. The menu looked amazing and it was so tough deciding what hat we'd get. We started with fried zucchini (some of the best I've had) and boneless hot wings. I ordered Alfredo the Dark and my husband ordered a deep dish pepperoni and sausage pizza. We decided to share so we could try both . My son was so excited to see spaghetti and meatballs and quickly ordered. The food was so great. We've been driving past here for a year and I am kicking myself for waiting so long. My pasta was perfect and had the perfect kick to it. The jalapeño really gives it something special. My husband said he can't wait to go back and try the sandwiches and a few other things so I know he thought it was a hit as well. Great addition to Surprise."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for one night for a business trip and really didn't want to go to the expensive restaurants near my hotel. I came upon Oregano's based on the Yelp! reviews.

I forgot my waitress's name, but whoever she was, you made my (single awkward girl sitting in a corner by herself) night!!!!! I know I didn't get any pizza - can't finish it - but I LOVED my buffalo wings. I'm so happy you got me a non-alcoholic root beer (being responsible and all). And Oh my, the pizza cookie.... yes, it knocked me out for the rest of the night but I do not regret it a single bit. If I came to Phoenix again, for my work, you can bet for sure I'll be back there, by my lonely awkward self, waiting to devour another pizza cookie.

The service - in case it wasn't clear - was absolutely wonderful, I had a great time, and I rave about you to all my friends - if they ever come out to Phoenix, I mean."}
{"text":"Food was great and filling but takes a long time. They did warn us it would be an hour for the pizza but we still got tired of waiting. If you can save some room for the skillet cookie!"}
{"text":"Between one to two people - all you need to order:

1. Toasted Ravioli Espaniol 
2.  Vino Bambino Salad

 I won't hold it against you if you finish it on your own. It's just THAT good."}
{"text":"Worst service I've received in a long time from a restaurant with such a good name. We not only were seated behind parties that arrived after us (maybe the checked in online, but that didn't seem to be the case; however, we did give them the benefit of the doubt), we then got to our table and the floor was a mess and needed cleaned and it took them about 5 min to have three people get a mop. My husband even offered to clean it himself if they would just hand him a rag. Then the table seated next to us that arrived after us was served before us. It was not a good experience. We came for my mother in laws birthday and the service issue outweighed the tasty food. We love the food here but cannot believe this happened tonight."}
{"text":"Oregano's is my favorite place to get Pizza in Tempe/Phoenix.  I grew up on \"Chicago Style Thin\" in Illinois and this gets it just about perfect.  The service is always good, even though this location is the busiest.  I haven't had anything other than the pizza, but friends who have tried other things say they are good.  Plus, the pizza cookie for dessert on a special occasion is always a treat!  Oregano's has a heavy hand with the spices usually, but I like that so it's great for me.  

I did take-out once and it was great.  Will use them again!"}
{"text":"I think my love for Oregano's is only exceeded by my husband's love for Oregano's. I could eat the Italian sausage sandwich and those dang waffle fries three times a day if I had the metabolism of a vole. As is I usually take half of the monstrous sandwich home to devour for breakfast the next morning. The vino bambino salad is glorious.

I haven't tried pizza here, but everything else is great. When family from out of state comes to visit I like to get a party-sized trough of various pastas and the garden salad, and everyone in my family has really enjoyed this. They'll make ziti without the meat as well if you want to please a gathering of vegetarians."}
{"text":"No one at the front desk and so we waited. About 3 employees clearly know we were waiting but did not even acknowledge us or tell us someone's going to be with us in a bit. They just didn't care, maybe it's not their job. 2pm shift Saturday"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Took some time to get seated but it was worth the wait. The waitress was attentive and friendly. Definitely better than the Germann, Chandler branch"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! My Boyfriend and I are missing Oregano's now that we have moved from Arizona to Pennsylvania. My favorite is the Big Rig Pasta. YUM! Don't forget your Pizza Cookie! If you're of age, get a Dirty Monkey - tastes just like a tropical drink! My family always visited me during the 7 years I was in Arizona and every time they visited, we went to Oregano's!"}
{"text":"The pizza is thin crust and very good.  Maybe a bit greasy, but still really good.  I didn't have a beer when I was here, so I can't comment on the selection.  No sports on TV, just old movies.  The decor is like you walked into a rummage sale from 1950.  Great outdoor patio and a nice inside spot also.  Not a huge fan of the atmosphere indoors, but thats just personal taste.  I like sports on tv when I'm in a restaurant, not the lone ranger.  
Very friendly staff and great pizza.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Oregano's is an amazing place for being a chain. Pizza is good, I get the thin crust. The Picasso salad is beyond amazing and big enough for two people. Prices are reasonable and you get a large amount of food. Only issue is they can get busy. I order takeout and you have to call early as they have takeout windows that can be an hour or after you order."}
{"text":"Visiting the area for the first time. We ordered Grandma G's roasted chicken and potato pizza and the chicken and broccoli pizza. The chicken and broccoli was a little too strong on the broccoli flavor and the staff quickly offered to replace the pizza with something else and my daughter ordered the Zany Ziti with chicken.  It was delightful.  We all ate too much which is a sign of good food and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I love their \"Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad\". It's delicious. Make sure you make a reservation though. I waited for 25 minutes before I had dinner on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I find the food to be consistently good at Oreganos.  The Pizza options are amazing (recommend Chicago style).  Leave room for the big cookie dessert."}
{"text":"Hit or miss on the food depending on what day and time of day you go. Service is usually good though. Lunch time weekend is usually a long wait."}
{"text":"It's best to go when you aren't super super hungry because the pizza literally takes an hour to come out. It is delicious and thick pizza though so yummy the service is awesome as well"}
{"text":"Oreganos has one of the best pizzas, my children and I love to eat here so friendly and delicious food."}
{"text":"I recently visited Oregano's Pizza Bistro when I was in town for a family graduation at ASU. All I can say is WOW! Amazing Italian food. The only criticism that I have is that it took about 20 min to seat us, and the service was slow. That stuff aside this is some of the best Italian food I have had in quite some time."}
{"text":"Been twice. 
Atmosphere is musical, loud, and good 
The wait, even when the place doesn't seem to be busy, is a long, long wait.
The food and Service are ok- staff is very smiley, but a 25 minute wait for a veggie sandwich ?"}
{"text":"Delish! Thin crust is their standard but try the numero one-o pan pizza with pineapple,  it will be your new favorite"}
{"text":"I'm honestly never disappointed when I eat here. Everything is always fresh and the staff is always great. I'll always keep coming back. Their drinks are great, the pastas, salads, pizza, pretty much everything is awesome here. Definitely recommend for a family dinner. A crowd pleaser for sure!"}
{"text":"We have gone to this location several times & unfortunately we are always disappointed with service & timing. Last night topped it off & resulted in writing this review. Living so close to Gilbert ave, we go to many of the restaurants on that strip & only at this oreganos location we have had horrible service. Last night we arrived at 8:25 with a party of 6, & we were told the wait would only be 30 minutes. We were not seated until 9:25. We totally understand that we can't force guest out of their seats because they were chatting. But once they took us to the back patio to seat us, there was 5-6 large empty tables. Of course the manager knew we were frustrated & complimented a cold cheesy bread. After placing orders we did not officially eat until 10:05. All I can say is the cheesy bread did not make up for our frustration.. & the over all food was mediocre compared to other restaurants in the area. As mentioned this is not the only time this location has disappointed me. A previous time we had to wait over an hour for a medium pizza & when all of the other entrees came out they were cold (so probably just sitting there). On another occasion we did a date night at this location & the timing was actually perfect, the service not so much. The waiter was rude & barely attended our table. After 3 bad experiences over a 4 month period of time  that's my line in the sand, I am writing this review in hopes that either management will read this or others to help influence better customer service & time management in the future. I will not be returning to this location, unless it's take out because thus far it is the only time they seem to get it right. PS the Blue Moon was so warm that I added ice cubes from my ice water just to cool it off. & I did not finish it, & that's something that never happens."}
{"text":"Lady is a scampi is my all time favorite! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water..."}
{"text":"This may be my favorite Oregano's location. Even better the ASU Oregano's and definitely trumps the Elliot one closer to our home. 

Seriously, the food at Oregano's is consistently delicious no matter which one you go to. But the Germann and Dobson location serves up more than great food. We're talking customer service, here! 

We came here on a Monday night back in July for Dude's birthday *cough, OLD MAN! cough*. Normally I love me some air conditioning; however, I had just took a shower and was fuh-reezing. Patio it is. Two high power mister fans out there. 

Our server AJ was a total sweetheart even though it was her day before her weekend began. Suggested some great drinks to us, the D'Liscious Rootbear float for Dude, and Red Sangria for me. 

I'm not a big rum girl, but Dude had to put his beverage on lockdown after I took a few sips! So good. You can skip the pizza cookie if you're so inclined and just get this as dessert. 

We ordered one of our usuals, the Oregano's Favorite Salad (Jr. Size) and the Big Rig Pasta with Sausage. Plenty of spice! And apparently, they fly in the sausage from Chicago. That explains a few things. 

To garner herself a nice tip, AJ hooked Dude up with a free white chocolate macadamia nut pizza cookie for his birthday. Half baked goodness! They're definitely meant for four people . . . But let's be honest, we weren't exactly \"behaving\" in the dietary sense that night. 

Thanks for making it a great birthday, Oregano's and AJ!"}
{"text":"In August of 2011, Oregano's Pizza Bistro did South Tempe a solid and decided to give this area a location. Woohoo! And unlike the other locations, there's loads of available parking here. 

I actually came here with my coworkers for the grand opening. Dude and I have enjoyed many a dinner out on the awesome patio during the \"Winter\" (come on, Arizonans . . . ), taken our out of town friends here. 

Usually, we'll just get a Big Rig with Spicy Sausage and an Oregano's Favorite Salad to-go. 

Our friend was recently relocated to Arizona (go Army, thank a soldier today) and since his immediate family is currently out of town, we pulled it together to give him a nice welcome home. 

Six plus months with no pizza meant we were dragging Vinny's ass right to Oreganos.

Our server handled our party with style! Forgot her name, but she was a gal from San Diego. Hooked Vinny up with a free beer. And don't forget their delicious Boom Dip . . . Spinach Artichoke Dip with warm \"Italian Chips\". 

The three of us split the always delicious Numero One-O pizza! My sister in law got the Alfredo the Dark, mom and father in law each got the Big Rig, chicken and sausage.

And the obligatory pizza cookie. Which is totally meant for 4-6 people. Hello! 

Was the food great? Of course! Mentioned it before, no matter which location you go to, the food is consistently delicious and at that point it's the service that counts. 

Score one Oregano's for supporting our troops, and giving our friend an awesome night back in town. 

We'll keep going to this location!"}
{"text":"Good ol' Oregano's! 

This place is conveniently located across the street from Mesa Community College where I train. 

Met up with Missy F., Andrew C. and Sarah R. here after practice one night. Wreaking of sweat and dirt from the hammer ring, we opted to sit out on the patio. Oh, and it wasn't too hot outside . . . an Arizona rarity in August. 

Our server Kurt was friendly and attentive. 

We had the aptly named Oregano's favorite salad to start. Crispy romaine lettuce, sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, a sprinkle of feta, red onions, pine nuts, and raisins. And don't forget that honey vinaigrette dressing. Light and refreshing. 

We got the junior size. Worked out perfectly for a group of four, which was a surprise when you get a bunch of hungry Power Athletes together after training. 

On Kurt's recommendation, we ordered the thin-crust, medium sized Clark Street Meat Pizza. If you're a meat lover, get this one. It's got a generous helping of Chicago sausage, capicolla, salami, capped off with fresh basil, garlic and chili flakes. 

This was outside of my normal Oregano's repertoire, and not a huge \"Meat Lovers\" pizza fan to begin with . . . Yet . . . It was friggin' delicious! 

NOT getting a Pizza Cookie after is an Oregano's sin. Just share! 

All Oregano's are consistently delicious, but I think what made our trip was Kurt. He was a really fun guy to talk to (Jean Twenge's books, NOT becoming a smug married/ having kids in your late twenties just because society says so, etc.) and understands the meaning of a delighted customer. 

We'll be back, Kurt - Let us know if you enjoyed the book recommendation!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good here whether you decide to go thin crust or stuffed pizza.
Pasta and salad are also good. We've gotten Alfredo the Dark pasta and Pablo Picasso Mexican Salad.
If you go stuffed pizza expect that a single pizza will feed more than you'd expect."}
{"text":"So I should start out by saying - I have been to Oregano's countless times. It's ALWAYS a great experience, and definitely one of my go-to places. I should also mention that if you're looking for light / healthy options, you might as well not read my review. What we ordered was in no way light or healthy... But DANG was it good! 

Our server was extremely friendly and on top of it. I never have a problem with poor service here though (one of the many reasons I love it). My friend and I started out with the boom dip. BEST SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIP EVER. I promise... Get this. For our entrees, we really wanted to try something new since we have had pretty much everything on the menu. We noticed a gentleman at the table next to us had ordered a delicious looking pasta dish, but we couldn't identify what it was on the menu. We asked our server what he had ordered and his answer completely changed the game forever... Chicken Parmesan but he had subbed the marinara on it for Alfredo sauce. OK WHAT... THAT'S GENIUS. We said \"why the heck not\" and went with the mystery man's creative creation. It was just as amazing as it looked and my friend and I both agreed that we found our newest guilty pleasure (second to their pazookies). 

So like I said, not somewhere to come if you're looking for healthier options. But I will never regret a good Oregano's binge. The prices, the portions, the staff, it really can't be beat. AZ is so lucky to have a joint like this in nearly every neighborhood in the valley! 

Warning: Wait times may be long on Fridays and Saturdays. Sometimes they try to compensate for this with Pizza appetizers while you're waiting!"}
{"text":"First time here, service is great, food is awesome...portions are really good and all home made taste!! Loved it"}
{"text":"I am not a very big fan or Oregano's. There is always a wait because every location is built small, it upsets my stomach almost every time, the pizza is to thin to fill me up, and although the pazookie is great I can make it at home and not wait forever. This location in particular is always packed so unless you come at an odd time prepare to wait. Also if you want deep dish pizza, and not the cracker thin default, you have to wait an additional half and hour at least. The food is OK but not worth the wait in my book!"}
{"text":"When I came here, I had no idea what to expect. Never been here or heard of it since I moved to this state recently. I'm the kind of plain pizza. I don't like a lot of drama on my pizza, just give me pepperoni with a side of ranch and I'm solid. So we ordered this one I can't remember what it was called, maybe Margarita or Mary? But the pizza came with sliced diced tomatoes and basil. I was worried because I only like sun dried tomatoes but thankfully, that's exactly what was on it. It was really good and I can't wait to go again but to a closer location to home."}
{"text":"I love this place Every time I am in Phoenix I try to stop by the food is always good and plentiful. I had the lunch special antipasto... Large enough for two people... and the stuffed pizza... a little messy but very tasty... I will be back in few weeks"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I usually go early to avoid the huge wait during dinner time. We love the pastas and the wings. We can never get enough of their deep dish pizza! The waiters are always nice to us and they are always ready to help us answer any questions we have!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when they opened up a mile from my house but the service at this location is terrible. Twice in the past three weeks we placed a takeout order. They said it would be ready in an hour. When we showed up - both times!! - we were told that they were out of one of the dishes we ordered. They didn't bother to call us (even though they took our number when we placed the order) and just said \"Sorry. We're out of that. Do you want something else?\" Yeah. I would like a phone call, like an hour ago telling me what was up. Can I have that? Love the food but it's not worth the crappy service and bad \"oh well\"!attitude."}
{"text":"We went to Oregano's to have a later meal with our daughter.   We had to wait a bit, but time went by quickly.   Our waiter was very helpful in giving us the answers we asked concerning various things on the menu.   My husbands birthday was the next day, and he brought the cookie for him.  It was so nice.   Connor was an excellent server!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for a few years now and the food is great! Today our waiter, Sullivan, went above and beyond, it was without a doubt the best service I have ever had at a restaurant. Amazing food and amazing service I highly recommend the white chocolate macadamia nut pizooki for dessert, it's out of this world!"}
{"text":"Came here to eat for Easter Sunday, after a long weekend without any meat I just had to get me some lasagna and some deep fried calamari, this was our first time here and they had great food kid loved it nice place to hang out and have some great Italian food!!! Oh yeah and expect oregano and lots of it"}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary pre mix HAS GOT TO GO. They put vodka in an already bottled mixture and it's really nasty. The bar tenders need to learn how to make a Bloody Mary from scratch. It's really disappointing to come to a place with amazing food (because their food and service is pretty stellar) and drink literally the most disgusting Bloody Mary I have had in my life. I like really spicy and strong stuff, but that BM is just too much."}
{"text":"Came here for a murder mystery dinner and it was a blast! 

I tried the Dirty Monkey (solely because of it's name) and it was pretty good, but was basically a sex on the beach and crazy (and a bit too) sweet. My friend tried the red sangria which was much less sweet and very tasty. 

With our murder mystery ticket, we were given a buffet of two pastas, garlic bread, and two pizzas. Holy carbs Batman! We did start with a salad which made me feel better, but man did I feel carb overloaded. 

The food was very tasty, but was nothing amazing. Except the garlic bread, that was amazing (but unfortunately we were only given one piece). I bet their individual meals taste better, but I wasn't super impressed. 

Servers and decor are excellent though, so definitely a good option for a hearty dinner!"}
{"text":"Kristen provided the best service possible. The food was great. Had pizza thin crust, perfect.  Our service was timely and on time. Kept drinks full. We will ask for her section every time . Beef salad was great"}
{"text":"My first time at oregano and I got to say I'm disappointed! It was crowded where it was difficult to fit in the table, especially when other guests are sharing a booth seat and keep pushing it to where you couldn't breathe. The floor wasn't clean and you didn't even need to look at it, the way your foot stuck to the ground was the enough for you to know.The people that came after us received there food before us. 50 minutes later we finally got our food. Our server was being nice but his tone made it noticeable that it was all sarcasm. When the food came out the guacamole looked unappetizing; coloring was a dead giveaway that it wasn't going to cut it. When asked to have a new batch, they just gave us a side of avocado to mix in and by then the pizza was cold.  I had ordered a salad and you would assume that the dressing came with it. It did not!! I was charged .29 cents for ranch! It was awkward to ask of any other assistance without it seeming bothersome. Overall a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"I LOVE Oregano's!!! We usually get the thin crust pepperoni pizza and some medium wings. Now I love spicy wings but The hot ones are wayyyyyyy too hot! Like hurt your stomach hot lol but the medium wings are so good!  Also, my favorite is the Pablo Picasso salad! Omg it is to die for! I love the light chipotle dressing! And the junior salad is huge for one person...I always share it with my mom when we go! Also, you have to try their cheezy garlic bread...pair it with marinara and you're in heaven! :]"}
{"text":"Oregano's is hands down the greatest restaurant ever! When I lived in AZ, I would go there at least twice a week for lunch. Everything on the menu is delicouse. Thier hotwings are some of the best around and the boom dip is second to none as far as apitizers go. 

If you are in the mood for pizza, you cannot go wrong with the thin crust and i do mean thin! The stuffed pizza is also amazing but it takes a while to make.

The baked ziti and the angel hair with meadballs are the best pasta dishes.

When youre done with dinner you must get the pazookie! its simply the best!

I'm getting hungry just writing this."}
{"text":"Best food around.  Servers are usually awesome, hostesses could definitely use some training in customer service.  Great food for a great price"}
{"text":"Wow....I have been to Oreganos for many times in my life but this is my first review!  To start I truly believe this is the best pizza and maybe best local restaurant that we have in the Phoenix area. I love the Chicago stuffed crust pizzas we got it with Pineapple, ham, garlic last time, and I was truly in heaven. The crust is almost pie like and it's unreal. I've had deep dish in Chicago before and this is the closest too, but yet so Arizona. I actually prefer the way Oreganos has it. Only if they had a west valley location...hint...hint.

Anyways we had great service and shared a small stuffed crust pizza. Wow. We only ate 1 slice each and took most of it home and it lasted us at few more days.

We were too full to eat a pizza cookie, but I've had so many of them before and each were great.  We were really trying to save room but just couldn't squeeze anything else in because the pizza was so filling!"}
{"text":"Just an update. I've been here 2 more times and had excellent service and an excellent pizza each time. Last weekend we came around 8:30 on a Friday night and the wait for a party of 7 was about 35 mins. Not bad at all. Food good as usual. Def my favorite restaurant close to my house. I'll be back many more times!"}
{"text":"this is the alfredo the dark, it came with this bread which was a little to crunchy for my preference so I switched with my friend who's meal came with a different kind of bread. The meal was very nice and plentiful, nicely cooked noodles with very light but flavorful cheese based sauce. The service was good, nice and friendly people and a good experience. Fun environment as well and pretty fair priced."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why people like this place. I've eaten there four times and had three different things insured one entrée. I didn't like any of the food that I had, a few people told me the pizza was really good, but I thought it was just slightly below average at best, and that's me being nice about it. Personally I think there's much better options out there when it comes to eating out."}
{"text":"Always quick! Always delicious! Friendly staff. If there is ever a wait the hostess gives you a text when you're ready to be seated. Love this place."}
{"text":"My wife called Oregano's at around 6:30 PM to place a takeout order for one pasta dish and one salad. She was told that a simple takeout order would not be ready for pickup until around 8 PM. 

I've lived in cities with high demand, high quality restaurants (NYC and Chicago). I can understand a 1+ hour wait for a table and am used to that. But a 1.5 hour wait just for a simple takeout order? That's unacceptable. This tells me that this restaurant is just very poorly managed, nothing less."}
{"text":"Holy carbohydrates, Batman!

I'm no diet fanatic, but Oregano's really doesn't have much selection beyond pizza and pasta... even the salads can't escape the starches! That being said, it would be nice to see a meat/fish and veggie dish on the menu.

Ambiance:
-casual pizzeria Italiano joint
-patio outside is heated in the winter, misters in the summer
-slightly loud when busy, especially inside
-populated by all types of groups: families, groups of friends, etc. I was surprised to see a lot of 20-30 somethings.

Food:
-primarily a pizza and pasta menu, very few options otherwise
-one dessert: the pizookie
-started with the Big Bruschetta Authentico ($7.49): Big is right. The bread is so large, it's difficult to bite into. The bruschetta mixture was tasty, big hunks of tomatoes and garlic.
-I ordered the \"Lady is a Scampi\" (*snort*... $14.99) with mushrooms added. 5 stars for this dish, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and the chipotle scampi sauce was delectable. Enough for 2 meals. Comes with 2 breadsticks.

Drinks:
-we ordered a bottle of Snapdragon Riesling (~$19) instead of paying by the glass, I'd recommend this for any party of 2 or more. 

Service:
-no complaints
-5 minute wait time on a Sunday evening for the patio

An elevation from the traditional chain restaurant, if only slightly. That Scampi, tho!"}
{"text":"I have lived in the valley for almost 8 years now, and I have always avoided going to this place.  You see, I am Italian, and I am very picky about my Italian food, and how I like it.  Luckily my Oregano's-obsessed boyfriend made me go with him to the first time ever at this location.   

Now, I'm not quite sure what I thought Oregano's was (::cough:: Olive Garden ::cough::) but it id diametrically different from my assumptions.  I have heard that they have taken a ton of stuff off of the menu and for that, they have lost a star.  But in all honesty, what I had was great.

Our waiter Shawn/Sean was attentive, nice (and pretty) and laughed when we decided we wanted a deep dish pizza with 10 toppings on it.  He began to realize we were serious with all of the toppings when we didn't laugh and looked him square in the eye... He took out his pencil and paper and asked us to resume.  (That part was funnier than I've made it out to be.)

They had an okay selection of beer, but luckily a good one. He was on point with our order and let us know well in advance how long it would take to cook our monstrosity.  I appreciated the heads up as  our pizza took all of 30 minutes but for fresh, custom, deep dish pizza, it was well worth the wait.

As a woman that revels in her pizza making skills and her cooking abilities, Oregano's made a damn good pizza that day, and for that I commend them.  Just make sure to not remove anything else off the menu and we'll be good. 

P.S. Th Bruschetta was ridiculous. It was so tasty, I'll probably go back to copy the recipe... YUM!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the anti pasta salad!! Whenever we come here, we have to get dessert! I love how the kids have a very inexpensive menu and so they can get more than just a slice of pizza. My fiancé loves the Italian sandwich. It's basically the same thing as my salad in a sandwich form. Very great sangrias too."}
{"text":"Delicious appetizers while you wait 20 for main course.

I've been to this location and many others a lot of times and I am always happy to be there. It's the way they greet you like they are so happy to see you, the way they say goodbye like they can't wait for you to come back and the way they serve you like it's been their dream job. The food is always on point and I have never had a bad experience. I've tried the Pablo Picasso salad, a large lovely salad with tortilla strips, spicy chicken, cheese, pico de gallo and spicy dressing (available in a smaller size). The Alfredo the Darkwith chicken, pasta with alreado, pico de gallo, and a spicy salted jalapeno (always take home leftovers). The last time I was there the waitress was pretty MIA but that was a first ever. I'm  sure she was just having a rough day and let's face it, SERVERS ARE HUMAN TOO! I will definetely be back regardless."}
{"text":"First time I had pizza here for some reason....and cant they make something that is gross!  I have eaten here tons of times and every experience with the food and service is the best ever.  I have had the Alfredo the Dark (fettuccine alfredo), the big beef sandwich, the big tuna sandwich, and now chicken wings and pizza.  The alfredo is so creamy and flavorful with a bit of spicy to it.  I remember not being able to finish the gigantic plate of noodles.  The beef sandwich makes my mouth water just thinking about it but my table was craving to share pizza and wings today so we ordered the pepperoni pizza thin crust and it was truly amazing.  The garlic was perfect the crust was and cheese were a great consolidation of flavor.  The chicken wings were great also, the sauce was a little thick and had a garlic hint to it as well.  Of coarse what would a visit to Oregano's without ordering a macadamia nut pazookie!  Man, this place is the best place for the cookie desert with ice cream, the half cooked cookie inside a good 10\" pan and about 1/2\" thick is so flavorful and good.  I almost got sick from eating to much.  Also if you have never been to an Oregano's be prepared to wait since they are always busy, the atmosphere is way casual and the decor is so very cool and trendy.  I cant think of a better consistent trendy place for great food and great service.  It's most definitely as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Lively ambience , good pizza with good friends makes it a wonderful evening. Tried the número uno and pesto pizza with Cajun chicken . The thin crust was crisp but probably a bit over done ! The toppings especially the numero uno ( sausage and pepperoni was worth the try ) ."}
{"text":"Finally made it here twice now at this new location on 67th ave and Bell road in the NW valley.  I have heard that they are going main stream and there food was not as good but I have to tell you that most people are full of sh*t.  I have ordered the big beef sandwich, alfredo the dark for lunch now and the food maybe even better.  I also got the pazookie which they can cook more quickly now since it is thinner but just as phenomenal to eat and quite frankly people do not need to eat more than what they offer....this country is getting to fat anyway.  This location is small and casual just like the others so you can expect long wait times at dinner and peak lunch times.  It is well worth it if you have the time.  I will have to order in the pizza soon since I have not had that in a while."}
{"text":"Ordered a Thin Pizza for Carryout. Why did I pick Oregano's? Because caramelized onion was a topping on their menu.
I looked up 3 places and settled on Oregano's JUST because of that.
The onions were NOT Caramelized. Sauteed? 
Only reason I care is that I don't like onions at all unless they are grilled or caramelized.
The thin crust was good. The pepperoni, sauce and cheese was tasty. The sausage- outstanding. I probably would have rated a 4. Pretty good pizza. Not provel cheese, but the pizza reminded me of St Louis style and I like that."}
{"text":"This is definitely our family's favorite. We ALWAYS take our out of town guests here and they LOVE it!!  Fabulous friendly staff, excellent food, awesome atmosphere!!  Here's a hint for you....if you want their deep dish pizza which is DELICIOUS, order it as soon as you put your name in to be seated!!  The deep dish takes about 45 mins but is sooo worth it!!  The Vino Bam Bino is the bomb!!!  Get the junior size unless you plan on sharing. Finally, finish it off with their famous pizza cookie!!!  A must!!!  

The ONLY change I would like to see is a few more items on the kids menu. Right now the only offerings include pizza by the slice and a bowl of pasta. My kids would love a grilled cheese, chicken tenders or even a pb&j. We dine at oreganos at least twice a week so the kids get pretty tired of the 2 choices. Anyway, we still LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit ever and I have heard so much about this place for 2 years now!

I had a margarita pizza and the Pablo salad  (shared with boyfriend). The pizza was good, thin and crispy and the salad was massive and delicious. Our friends had the Pablo salad and the shrimp salad and both were great.The service was a little slow since we ate at the bar, but that's because it was busy. Our bartender was nice and polite and found the time to chat with us for a little but despite being busy.

The menu is so huge that I think I was a little overwhelmed at first but would love to go back and try some of the other items."}
{"text":"I feel my self and most other people don't take enough to time to leave a positive review,  I came here this evening on a Tuesday night and sat at the bar and had Aryiel as my server.  I was very impressed with her and she went above and beyond with recommendations and even told me about a salted caramel pazookie I never knew you had.  This was definitely refreshing as it seems impossible to find good service anymore. Will return again and ask for her."}
{"text":"I don't care what other yelpers say. I love Oregano's!
This chain was started by Mark Russel, a former flight attendant for America West Airlines. I heard recently that he sold the business for 2.5 million, so the chain could expand outside Arizona. Good for him! 
I've been to  3 other locations, but this place is the one that my friends and I meet up all the time. Sometimes we just end up sitting at a bar if we don't want to wait. 
Parking is a joke here, but who cares! We come here for the food! 
I've had the Pablo Piccaso Salad and the Julius Ceasar. Both are huge! 3 people can share this. Boom Dip is also awesome and most definitely the Bollo Pasta. 

Portion sizes:  Perfect! This is the reason why we keep coming back. 

Execution:  Also perfect.  If I were to find something (anything) to criticize, it might be just the parking. 

Service:  Excellent. Waitstaff are very attentive and they give you  small samples of the blended bellini. (If you ask)  Totally squisito!

There's more to say, but you get the point."}
{"text":"This was my first visit (9/4/2016) to Oregano's. I have heard of it through friends so we decided to stop in. We were seated immediately although there were six of us in our party. Customer service is fantastic. We ordered the deep dish with pepperoni, sausage and green peppers, but unfortunately, our wait person hit the wrong button and placed a pan instead. The manager on the floor apologized and gave us the pan without charge. We indulged. Not too much later our deep dished arrived--and we dugged in. Delish! Our wait person was apologetic and checked on us frequently. I believe it was his first day. I'll definitely recommend Oregano's. If I'm in the area again, I'll make sure to stop by. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I live for their baked pesto pasta with chicken. service is always amazing, prices reasonable and portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I recently went to this place for the very first time.  It was really disappointing.  I had the chicken lasagna.  Very, very little chicken (and I really looked for it -- a small piece here or there).  Not even tasting it at all.  It was also a pretty small portion for the price.  The most egregious problem of all was that the pasta was chewy.(!)   I actually had to take a piece out of my mouth and lay it aside, it was so hard to chew.  The whole bottom layer of the lasagna was inedible - could not cut it with my fork even!  That's pretty bad for a pasta place.

On the plus side, the people who work there are great - very friendly and responsive (only reason I didn't rate it a one star).  If I do go back, I will be certain to avoid the lasagna, but I seriously doubt I will go back.  I will go back to Olive Garden - their lasagna isn't 'chewy'."}
{"text":"The food is good but the wait times are crazy! While waiting i have seen well over 20 parties walk out after being told it would be up to an hour and a half wait time! This place needs to maybe think about expanding the size asap as it has been this way since day one. You can check in on yelp to save yourself waiting in that ridiculously small lobby. Order out is recommended"}
{"text":"I am going to give this location 5-stars just to even out the idiotic people (Jeff G. and Mike K.) who reviewed the wait time of a restaurant that has just opened up.

Here is a fact of life: when popular restaurants open up at a new location, said location will have extremely long and abnormal wait times for at least 1-2 months.  This varies depending on the restaurant and the area.

I don't know why anyone would go to this Oregano's with the ridiculous expectation of being seated immediately and served their order within 15-20 minutes.

This place is brand new!

People are still learning, it is incredibly popular, there are tons of visitors here for Spring Training, and there should be an understanding of what to expect."}
{"text":"Best place ever. We have been coming here for years. Have tried everything on the menu. Yummy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Eh, I don't get what the big deal about this place is. All my friends say they love eating here and that it's the best Italian food around. I beg to differ. The food isn't bad, don't get me wrong. We ordered a thin-crust pizza (can't remember which, but it had some kind of white sauce) and it was okay, but definitely not the best. The deep-dish pizza takes so long to cook and we didn't think we'd make it till then, so we skirted away from that part of the menu. I don't know, maybe those pizzas are better. I'm willing to give this place another chance but for the price and hubbub, the food was just okay, the wait was long, and the noise level was ridiculous for a lunch hour. Even our waitress was a little annoying, I hate to say. She insisted on chatting with us before she took our order, and we were hungry! Only plus: the cookie/ice-cream dessert we had was hot and delicious. I'll go again if I ever get the urge to give it a second chance (or if I just want another pazookie), but as for entrees, I love Italian food, and I've had much better for around the same price."}
{"text":"Excellent service with a friendly environment. The decor is interesting, all depression era memorabilia. Food is amazing, and the pastas are very good"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza tonight! Great Salad, great service and staff! Not a long wait but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Lots of options, my salad was the biggest I've ever seen and it was delicious!! Vegan options too which is always nice :)"}
{"text":"Long wait since very popular joint, food was sub par for the price paid. More of a tourist place then a good eating restaurant"}
{"text":"Great pizza bistro, but plan on waiting during weekend dinner times there is usually a high volume of people and they do not take reservations. Several locations around the valley. They offer indoor and out door seating with vibrant atmosphere and music.
Take advantage of their lunchtime specials. All portions are large with moderate pricing."}
{"text":"Very good but pricey if you want to order your own pizza.  Food is great, very noisy inside."}
{"text":"I love that their dishes are served family style for everyone to share. Their guacamole appetizer is unique in a good way! I've never had a deliciously crisped thin crust cheese pizza as the dipper to fresh made guacamole with cilantro. I crave their Beefstro salad with thinly sliced steak and carmelized onions over spinach and lettuce and house spicy vinaigrette, Yummm! I always try new things but I can't help but to get the salad every time I go. This is my favorite salad for sure."}
{"text":"Opting in to the Deep Dish Pizza with the 1 hour wait- DISCLAIMER was definitely the biggest let-down ever. For such an extensive  wait, it's fair to assume that you are ordering something made-to-order and done to perfection... Not in this case. For starters, the appropriate description for this failure should be \"would you like a doughy crust with your cheese explosion\". There was easily over 36 ounces of cheese mixed with uncooked peppers and onions and a small portion of protein tucked under the cheese bed, then tomato paste slathered over the top. 

My family made the decision to go to dinner because we were hungry. The bar was raised a notch when we opted in to the hour pizza. It was such a bust that 2 bites in, we began brainstorming on how we could put it in our new-wave oven at home and cook it till the doughy crust was done, but would that mean the raw peppers and onions mixed in with the cheese would be done too? Wait a second here, that's why we came out to dinner... for the Oreganos chefs to do that part. 

Result: Manager confirmed that the pizza was definitely undercooked (as he slipped the spatula under the pizza and played with the floppy crust). He then apologized and offered dessert on the house. The peanut butter cookie topped with ice-cream was a tasty dinner replacement."}
{"text":"The only local chain I really like. Great lunch specials. Deep dish is fantastic ! Arrive early or expect a wait. Pick up orders are a good way to go too with priority parking."}
{"text":"Always love Oregano's and this location is my favorite. We love to go out to the patio and sit at the bar.  Their outdoor bar is tucked in the corner so it's not as hectic when you sit there on a busy night.  I recommend splitting a pizza in half with 2 different styles. Last time we tried half Clark Street Meat, and half Rosemary Chicken Potato. Also, the Italian gold wings are the best."}
{"text":"Oregano's rocks! This location is the best by far. Cool atmosphere and awesome staff! I've never had anything from their menu that I haven't liked and every time I go the staff recommends something new for me that is always right on. Had the shrimp diablo pasta last time out, it was great, but very spicy! 

I usually get a sub, meatball or sausage. All the pizza is fantastic, and their wings are probably the best in PHX (being from Buffalo myself I should know!) 

What can I say Oregano's, I love you!"}
{"text":"Excellent and probably the best pizza in Surprise. My biggest hang up is the wait time. I guess it is not their fault they are so good and everyone wants to eat there. But, the wait is long."}
{"text":"We went to Oreganos to celebrate my sister's birthday. I chose it based on the last time I was there, two weeks prior. I told her there wasn't a wait the first time I went but if there is a wait we will order some wine to pass the time. 

Big mistake. The wait was long which is not the problem. The hostess still didn't know what was going on. We wanted to order a drink while we waited so the hostess said she would send the cocktail waitress over. I understand they were busy but when she finally came over to take our drink orders she was not very friendly. About twenty minutes go by and she brought me my water but still hasn't served my mom or sister the wine they ordered. Then she came over with the bill in hand and gave us our total. I told her that we still haven't received our drinks and asked for the tab but she wouldn't give it to me and very rudely responded that she can't carry the glasses and the bill at the same time, as if I was stupid. I handled this very calmly because I did not want to upset my sister and just asked for the bill. It was very awkward because she wouldn't give it to us so finally my sister just gave the waitress her card and paid for her own drinks. 

When we were seated the restaurant started clearing out.  The server we had seemed to be brand new or he was a bus boy that was given our table. He forgot to bring us a few things but overall he was friendly, very nice and patient with us. 

I have an issue with people who are rude for no reason. If you can't handle working in a busy environment please find a job that makes you happy. Maybe this cocktail waitress was having a rough day but the whole drink situation left a bad taste in my mouth. I will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"No such thing as stopping here for a light bite. Come here hungry and strap on the feed bag. And you'll still have plenty to take home in a go box! Comfortable restaurant with comforting takes on casual Italian fare. The bruschetta appy is great, along with the fried zucchini. The calamari not so much. Pizza great, pasta great... No room for dessert! Heaters on the patio can be a little too warm, but a decent trade off when there is a wait for inside dining."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and was so impressed with the excellent customer service! The wait was kinda long for a Thursday night but the hostess let us know that it's typical for them since they are quite popular. We waited about 20 minutes before we were seated. Everyone was very friendly and our waiter was so knowledgeable when we asked for his advice on what to order. We ended up ordering \"Alfredo The Dark\" and the \"Pablo Picasso Mexican Salad\". The order came out from the kitchen and was delivered to our table in less than 20 minutes! My friend and I were very surprised and impressed with how fast it was. Both dishes were absolutely delicious! The portions here are ginormous so if you're thinking about splitting a meal... I say do it. We also decided to order the \"Original Pizza Cookie\" in half White Chocolate Macadamia Nut and half Salted Caramel. Both flavors were good but I preferred the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut side more. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great to find a place where the food is tasty, plentiful, and the employees are very pleasant and happy to see customers!  Amazing salads and yummy pizza.  Haven't had the pasta items, but am impressed with a cleverly worded and varied menu:)  Happy to live near this casual and inexpensive restaurant.  Fun decor, too!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Oregano's! On this particular visit, we ordered the Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad and the Sproccoli pizza. The salad was amazing and full of flavor. The pizza was delicious as well, but not one of my favorites. As usual, I recommend any Oregano's location."}
{"text":"You always know you're going to have a great meal when you go to Oregano's. I visited on Saturday and as usual, left happy and full. There was a 45 minute wait for 2 of us at 8:00pm, but that is the norm. There is always a wait....at all of the locations. 

The service/atmosphere: Excellent. Service is always on par even when they are super busy. Atmosphere at all locations is awesome and they are always playing great music. 

The food: I always order the bellini to drink, It is one of my favorites in the valley and pretty strong. We started with the cheese bread (so good!). For dinner, we split the Pablo Picasso Mexico salad and the Sausage & Peppers. The salad was so delicious with lots of goodies. Sausage & peppers was done very nicely and packed with flavor. We were too full to order dessert, but the Pizza Cookie is always an excellent choice. 

Other menu favorites from previous visits include:
Guaca-Tony
Wings of Fire
Vino Bambino salad - my go to salad, the shredded chicken is amazing!
Waffle fries 
Any thin crust pizza
Alfredo the Dark
Zany Ziti

There are so many things on the menu I haven't tried, so you bet I'll be back many more times!"}
{"text":"I came in with my husband and in-laws to celebrate my birthday a few weeks ago. We started with a cheesy artichoke bread spread app and some hot wings. The wings have been much better in the past but weren't nearly as meaty as I remember. I ordered a spicy shrimp pasta but subbed the protein for chicken and it was delicious!  I shared some of my sister in law's Pablo Picasso salad, which is just the best salad ever! My husband shared a thin crust pizza with his mom and it was very disappointing but the others at the table that ordered deep dish were very pleased with their order. For dessert we were treated to a pizza cookie with scoops of vanilla ice cream (I ordered half and half peanut butter and chocolate chip). The service was good even though we had a large group and the prices were reasonable for the portions. I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants but this is one of the better ones for sure."}
{"text":"How can Oregano's be receiving an average of four out of five stars, when they serve by far the tastiest variety of Italian, with the best value?! 
Pizza=amazing
Any entre salad=delicious
Big Rig pasta=amazing
Italian sausage, meatballs=out of this world
Pizzacookie=amazing

One wish, stop showing the old 50's reruns and show anything else."}
{"text":"Great dishes, pizza, both thin and think crust, and sandwiches. Friendly staff and great service."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 8. Was so disappointed and quite frustrated by the time we left. Got here at 11:45 and left at 2:00. Not because we wanted to take a 2+ hour lunch. But because we waited over 60 minutes to get just part of our order. They brought out tiny appetizer plates for us to dish the pizza onto. The slice practically hung over the edge much less where is the room for the salad. The salad came after the pizza which was way backwards. Music was so loud I couldn't even hear my friend across the table. The only reason I give it a 2 star is because the greeting staff was pleasant. Otherwise this place was a total let down."}
{"text":"Love the deep dish, love the thin crust, love the dessert. Cannot go wrong!!! It's always busy because they are always packed because it's so good. They also take time to prepare the pizza, the deep dish at least 20 minutes but worth it. I have nothing bad to say even the service is lovely :)"}
{"text":"I used to love Oregano's sandwiches, but I've noticed their portions seem to be getting smaller and smaller.  Don't get me wrong, the portion size was ridiculous to start with, but it was kind of nice knowing I'd spend ten or eleven dollars on a sandwich, and it, with the fries, would be enough for a meal and one to go.  As I'm writing this, I suddenly feel this is a first world problem, but shame on Oregano's for spoiling me in the first place.  That being said, their vegetarian sandwich is really excellent."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Arizona, by far! My favorite is their amazing artichoke/spinach dip....dont miss it. Awesome wine selection"}
{"text":"Glad I took a stroll to find this pizza joint. Anyone looking for a quick bite and good should not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very long wait times for a table. Once at a table, no waiter came to see us for a long while. Once he did, we gave our order. Then we waited for our drinks. When appetizers finally arrived, we were not given silverware or plates. Finally I went to the sign in desk to ask for silverware and the manager.  The greeter brought us silverware, the our waiter came right over with more silverware. The manager eventually came to our table and said she would make sure our pizza would be out in a timely fashion. They gave us a free cookie with ice cream to make up for things. If you are going to this restaurant, plan on a 3+ hour meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but very standard. Everything tastes nice, but it's not spectacular. I was very impressed with the service, though. I was out with some friends and my friend's young daughter - the moment we were seated, the waiter brought over some dough for the daughter to play with in order to keep her entertained. Props for that!"}
{"text":"We sat outside near the fire pit ? It was greatthey need to improve on the taste of their pizza bowl for the Italian Soup The Italian sausage is very tasty?"}
{"text":"They have geat Chicago style pizza! I had cheesy bread as an appetizer, the frisco pizza, and shared a pizookie for dessert. The service was great and the food was even better, they also give huge servings."}
{"text":"Food is good but average in my opinion. Too many menu items. It's hard to do a great on a lot of menu choices. Limited bar options. I could not get a Manhattan, no vermouth!"}
{"text":"This that been a family favorite for many years.  The food is delicious and the Bellini is pretty tasty.  We recently visited to celebrate my birthday with our kidos and it wasn't a normal great visit.  I think our waitress was having a tough evening and our table was totally uneven on the patio so our food trays kept sliding to the side of the table.  We told the waitress however nothing changed :)  I might suggest it's time for a few new tables"}
{"text":"I wanted all the Parmesan. I was going to wait for the server to say \"tell me when you'd like me to stop\" and I was going to never say when and have the whole bucket of cheese on my pasta, but he only gave me one scoop. I still ate it but still."}
{"text":"I don't know why this oreganos gets a bad rap. They are always busy, every location is, but I usually pick up to go and it is always good. The staff is nice and I like how they pack the order in front of you so you never get home and realize something is missing. We usually get the wings which are killer, the beefstro salad that had amazing dressing and cheese bread with marinara. We do switch up the salad and sometimes get pizza, we are never dissapointed. At a busy time, say Friday night, expect a long wait for eat in or pick up, but I can't hate on them for that. They are busy for a reason!"}
{"text":"I love Oregano's!  Their Pablo Picasso salad is one of my favorites along with the calamari. Their pizookie's are the best in the area. We love half peanut butter and half chocolate chip. The service has always been amazing and we will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I don't hand out the 5s very often on Yelp or elsewhere. We had 2 pizzas: thin crust cheese and thin crust pep/onion. Both were terrific. I picked them up to eat at home. They were hot and ready on time. The place was packed at 7:30 on Saturday night. Fast service at the cashier. I am a pizza lover from Chicago - and I generally go with the deep stuff but went thin for the rest of the family. Crust was light and crunch and the taste was a great balance between the sauce and the cheeses. Toppings were fresh and tasty. Don't miss this great pizza!"}
{"text":"I have yet to eat a bad meal here.  The food is great, the wings... get the Italian Gold. Sweet and so delicious.  Usually when we go, we get a 16\" pie with a few toppings.  3-4 people can easily polish one these off.  Lately though we've tried their calzone, and damn is that thing big.  Filled inside with tons of great ingredients, comes out piping hot and a taste that will last for a life time.

If you still have room for dessert, I highly recommend their pizza cookie. Once you eat that, there's no going back.  You'll drown yourself in a chocolate paradise.

I love this place!

The ONLY draw back (but still gave it 5 stars) is that if you dont get their early, get ready to wait for at least 30-40 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Ive always said Oregano's has been my favorite thin crust pizza place around, and it still is.  However... this location is my least favorite.  

We show up with a party of 6 at about 6PM and of course there's about a 45minute wait if you want to sit inside.  The only time Oregano's doesnt have a wait is on Sat afternoon about 1PM.  Literally the only time..   So they tell us that we can sit outside with the heat lamps and be seated right away.  We opt for the lamps and are seated.   Our waiter comes over and takes our drink orders and quickly returns with almost all the drinks.. he forgets our friends drink and when we mention it.. he scatters away and returns about 4min later with the drink.  By this time we order some wings and salads and the pizzas.  

While waiting for our food, we notice our heat lamp above us is not on, and ask to have it turned on.  they come over and do it.  For some reason I notice that our waiter is no where to be found.  I start seeing other people filling our drinks, giving napkins, cheese, etc.  Oh well.. multi-tasking I guess.

So our food arrives via our waiter and he begins serving with an apology.. he put the olives that were supposed to be on the side.. ON the pizza.  One of our bunch is allergic to olives.. yeah..  So he brings out the stuffed pizza and we begin to work on that and the few start eating the olive pizza.  They keep saying sorry and will be bringing out the cheese pizza with olives on the side.  I swear it seemed like 30 more minutes before we saw someone with the pizza.  Within those minutes, our waiter vanished again, only to be seen in small  blips across the back of our minds.  Finally.. the pizza arrives and while we're all mostly done, our friend gets to start eating.   The manager is very kind to take to not charge for the extra pizza of course, but to make things even better, he throws in a pizza cookie.  it was our friends birthday, so that's two cookies we get.. yummy.

So we're all finished, and it's time to wait for our bill.  (checks watch). Oh there he is finally..  he drops the bill off and I ask him for change for a $100 bill..  he leaves.  (checks watch).  \"Wow, did he just leave??\"  At one point I see him come back about 10 minutes later and serve another table a drink and I notice the 100 in his hand.. lol . Wow.. Finally he goes back to get me change.  

By now we're all ready to leave and we start to split the bill up.. here's the best part.  Our bill came out to around $77 and change and a friend throws in the tip, another throws in $20.. What do I do because Im not paying attention and my mind is all over?  I shell out 77 in cash (along with everyone elses money) and say \"20 on the card and the rest is yours.\"  

... I wonder why he was so nice when he came back with the card.    I guess I would be to if I got a $32.00 tip...    You would think he would have caught that.  

I think this is the most of said on any of my reviews.  Will I go here again? Of course I will.  I live in Glendale and unfortunately, until they build one in Glendale, this is the closest one..  I prefer the Tempe location."}
{"text":"I think I've managed to hit all the Oregano's in town.  This was my last one and as always, it was a pleasant visit.  Went with my girlfriend and her son and ordered wings, the blackened pasta and a pizza.  

Service was great and prompt and after we were all stuffed, the waitress asked us if we wanted to put a pizza cookie in .. .Yes please!!  Even if you are stuffed beyond anything, you MUST order one.  The three of us polished it off in no time flat."}
{"text":"Wow...Let me start off with letting you know I have been a cook for 25 years and  I understand everything that goes on in the industry.  I just picked up a Mac n cheese and a pizza  and unfortunately the Mac and cheese hit the ground and half of it spilled onto the parking lot at my car.   Shit happens.  I picked it all up and went back in and asked if they could replace it.  The manager said he couldn't replace it without charging for it again because \"they made it right.\"  Menu price is $5.49. Oregano's cost?  Maybe $1.   Never once in 25 years in any kitchen have I said that we couldn't or wouldn't replace it without charging, because we appreciated our customers and their business .  Would you charge me twice if my 4 year old knocked it on the ground and were at a table?  Or if your server dropped it?   The idea that you are ok with me delivering sub-par parking lot spiced Mac and cheese tells me many things.  Mainly you don't care about your job, your reputation or your food.  I have many friends in the industry and this story will go long and far.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Ate here last night for their grand opening. I am SO happy to have an Oregano's close by! 

This particular one is HUGE. A very large indoor seating area and and very large patio. They also have a waiting area/benches that can probably seat 100 people. They certainly are planning for long waits! It was busy last night, but we only waited ~15 minutes around 7 PM, so not too bad. Food was the usual: really good. Our waitress did really well -- it is clear they were well trained.

We will be visiting this Oregano's on a very regular basis!"}
{"text":"Haven't dined - in at this location before but I get take-out a lot and the girls helping me at the take-out counter are always so sweet and helpful! We are obsessed with the chocolate chip pazookies, even when you're stuffed, you wouldn't be having the real Oreganos experience without ordering one for dessert! It's a half pound of chocolate chip cookie dough, partly baked with scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The servers are all so friendly, and accommodating, the portions are large, and it always tastes fresh!

My boyfriend and I go in here on a semi regular basis. We recognize some of the servers, and they know who we are. We also come with his mother and little sister for family dinners and are never disappointed. 

The ONLY poor experience we have had there was the last time we went in. We, just he and I, ordered the Big Beefsro Salad to share. In terms of size, we were not disappointed, the salad was HUGE. But we did not like the flavors at all. We each maybe had 4 or 5 bites, which barely touched the salad, and had to order something else. Our waitress asked if we liked it and we informed her we couldn't eat it. She commented on how little of it we ate, that it barely looked touched and took it away. We ordered our normal pizza, and ate that just fine. When we received the bill the salad was on it, so I asked our server if there was any way we could remove it, or at least discount it, since we didn't even eat it. She looked at us and walked away to the bar filled someone Else's drink and came back to check if we were ready to pay. 
In the end we paid for it, and left, still tipped her well, even if she wasn't willing to help us. 

Other than that one experience though, every time we go in we are treated very well. It's always busy at dinner time, so come early! I highly recommend the Boom Dip, Toasted Ravioli Espanol, Bistro Sweet Po's, Thin Crust Pizza with sausage and pepperoni, the Chicago Stuffed Pizza with pepperoni (order this one To-Go, at the beginning of your meal as it takes 40-45 minutes to make and enjoy pizza all week at home!), and of course the Original Pizza Cookie (my favorite is the Peanut Butter!)!"}
{"text":"I often stop into this oreganos to pick up lunch and everyone is always friendly. I love that this location is centered in the heart of Scottsdale, not too far north or south. My personal favorites are Alfredo the dark with chicken, Pablo Picasso salad, big beefstro salad, all kale caesar(lots of kale). Although everything is delicious, those are my faves. Lady scampi is good too. This location's patio is nice and snug between the two restaurant buildings and service is always top notch!"}
{"text":"Nice Italian atmosphere with oversized portions. Menu is extensive and there is a good wine list, too. I recommend the eggplant parmesan."}
{"text":"I've never had anything that wasn't good. Service isn't always the best in terms of drink refills and getting the check when ready to leave, but other than that, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here one other time and that time, it was right after they opened and I had a great experience, even though there were a few hiccups. Flip side, tonight we ordered carryout and it was less than stellar. First off, when I called in our order, at the end of the call we weren't given a total and the girl who took the order didn't even say \"goodbye\", just hung up on me as I was saying goodbye.  
Picking it up was fine, felt welcomed and all was well, except we weren't given a receipt (didn't realize until we left). No biggie, except the fact our food wasn't right and didn't feel like waiting there for food to be remade. I ordered spaghetti with marinara on the side. It would have been great but instead of marinara, I got maybe one spoonful of meat sauce. Didn't realize it while there because the sauce is chunky anyway. We also got the pesto bread bowl but had asked for no sun-dried tomatoes on top. Can you guess what was all over the top?? Also, it was dry and didn't have much flavor. The cheese was the only thing that made it semi-edible. Only saving grace was the garlic bread. Honestly, that's the only reason we got dinner from there tonight and we wish it was the only thing we had gotten. We may come back to try the pizza but that'll honestly be the last chance that we give Oregano's Surprise."}
{"text":"The wait and the size of the establishment are my only real complaints. The cuisine is good....nothing amazing.  I am not a huge pizza fan just bc i think there is only so many ways you can make it with it  still being considered pizza. Oreganos has some original concepts but nothing that really jumps out at me.  if i had to choose a place to eat this would be one of them but not close to the top of the list.  FUN, Easy, and if your lucky it can be quick.  Try it out. Pasta Salads are one of the best things on the menu"}
{"text":"We come here a lot...and keep coming back except last time we waited about 50 minutes for a salad and Diablo shrimp...was around 2 pm on a monday. 

 Diablo shrimp
Meatballs and Angel hair
Lasagna
It's all great."}
{"text":"This is a great option for a family meal out. It is not East Coast pizza which was a bit of a bummer but they do have thin crust Chicago pizza which is pretty similar and, if you're a deep dish fan, you're in luck. The portions here are HUGE! Everything is supersized. It's impressive. The drinks are as tall as my forearm; no refills needed! We ordered the chicken wings - good size and the regular buffalo is a good choice. I highly recommend the brussel sprout appetizer. They were yummy! I thought the decor was fantastic. It was old time-y complete with I Love Lucy re-runs running. 

You can eat in or eat out. Good for kids and groups. The bar is pretty tiny, though."}
{"text":"Oregano's Pizza Gilbert

What can you say...best pizza joint in the city. You NEVER leave this place without a smile. They have all three of the essential triumvirate of a successful eating establishment - Great Fun Atmosphere, Awesome Food with Ample Selections,  & Nearly Perfect Service. 

My young daughter loves that they give her a glob of pizza doe to play with at the table. She made an octopus on this occasion. I have an Oregano's Beer Mug that I bring in for discounted draft refills. They have an awesome house draft beer which I can't recall the name of it - we'll call it Oregano Brew - anyhow it's a great beer. 

I love pizza but with some diet restrictions can't usually eat it. Wooohoo...they have thin crust WHOLE WHEAT crust...thanks Oregano's! We had it with pepperonis and their wonderful tasting sausage. 

I watched as my girls devoured the Oreganos PAZOOOOKIE dessert. If you haven't had this dessert then you just don't know...hands down the best dessert EVER! It's a 1/2 baked chocolate chip cookie in a skillet with homemade vanilla ice cream..wow! Zipps Sports Grill also serves a version of this dessert as well.

Service was good besides a couple of waiter blunders. Managent was very friendly and accommodating. Manager Fran (male) is an awesome cat...so if you go ask for Fran and tell 'em Zenn sent ya!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited while staying nearby at the Courtyard by Marriott. Walked down the street and was pleasantly surprised. They have an outdoor bar and you can sit on the porch or inside to eat. The bartenders are nice, and friendly. The drinks however are average to poor. They dont have a big selection, and SKY is the best vodka they have. Nowhere else is that topshelf. Ordered the calamari recommended by a bartender and dipped it in the buffalo wing sauce as suggested. The calamari was just frozen stuff and nothing special. I left after a couple average vodka tonics and went to another nearby place. I came back a second night and tried the pizza. The thin crust looked great, but when I ordered it the guy said it would take at least an hour cause thye have a small oven. SO, I switched to a pan. It was good, but not great. Would not go back I dont think."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!!! People are rude and I would rather drive further another oreganoes than go to this one , it's unfortunate"}
{"text":"Granted, I'm about to make this statement based on my first time being at an Oregano's  in quite awhile (a few years maybe?), but once you've been to one location you've pretty much been to them all...and that's a good thing! 

Oregano's has solid food & friendly service. This is probably like the fourth or fifth location I've been to over the years (the other ones were in Scottsdale & Phoenix). Honestly, the one thing about Oregano's I remember not liking as much in the past was their pizza (they have really good pasta & salads), but pizza was what I ordered this time and it was really good! It was a veggie pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, feta, and I can't remember what else but it was really good. Everything tasted fresh. We opted for thin crust, which I had never had from Oregano's before (maybe that's why I liked it better?).

I like Oregano's. I like this location. I like the fact that the Phoenix area has a local chain like this that's successful."}
{"text":"What a surprise when we came here. Been hesitating because of rating but very happy with the taste of the food and quality of ingredients. I had thin crust pizza w Canadian bacon with basil and light sauce. I'm now wishing I did regular sauce because it was delicious. Slight sweet flavor with kick on back of tongue.  Hubs had the big all hail Cesar with blackened chicken.  He didn't add dressing or croutons but use lemon wedges instead. Chicken was very tender with great flavor.  Found our new pizza joint that is worth driving to get!  Can't wait to try again soon."}
{"text":"Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water!! Such a tease! I wish we had one here in the Bay. The menu is HUGE and I mean that figuratively and literally. You can fan yourself with the menu, block out the entire neighboring table, build a fort, omg it's freakin' huge. I almost poked my friends eye out a few times oh and almost knocked everything off of the table. Everything here is HUGE. The water glass alone requires you to double hand it. If you are a soda lover like me and drink it so fast that you hate waiting for a refill...well you won't have that problem here because your soda glass is about a liter :) yippee!! 

I ordered the antipasti salad and it had so much yummy meat in it! It was a darn tasty salad and the dressing wasn't overpowering. I think it probably had more meat than lettuce...not complaining! One friend had the hot wings, yup, they have a diverse menu. The other friend had the ravioli. It was one giant ravioli! I had a few bites of it and it was good but it can definitely be a bit too much ravioli. 

The table next to us had a little tike and they gave him a roll of fresh dough and a pizza pan so that he could play with it. Kinda cool...wonder why we didn't get that option ;-) 

Again, wish this place was in the Bay Area. I love that they had misters in their patio/waiting area. It's obviously not there for looks. Did I mention Phoenix is HOT?! Heart this place!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing here but tonight our service was outstanding. Jerry was our server and he was so great. Thanks again Jerry!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Oreganos for 17 years and look forward to dinner when visiting Az.  I dined at this location tonight and felt that something was off with the food.  The penne pesto did not taste the same and the pizza was on the burnt side.  I have eaten at every location from Chandler to Flagstaff and NEVER had a bad experience, but this particular location missed the mark.  Almost turned me off to Oreganos entirely.

I think corporate management needs to investigate."}
{"text":"Under cooked pizza it was a little better then next day after cooking it more in the oven at home. Over priced with little to no care from our server. The meatballs were fantastic."}
{"text":"The wait was awful! They said 30 minutes and it took almost an hour, when I tried to ask how long it would take they would only tell us how many people were ahead of us. More people were coming out of the restaurant then coming in. I said first a available and there was an open take outside for over 30 minutes! Why couldn't they seat me there?? The hostess just stare at their little seating chart the whole time and don't look around for open tables!"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, great service and incredible food!!
We had the antipasto salad- it alone could be a meal for 2-3 and  the pasta with marina sauce & sausage! The sausage is their own recipe and made only for them, it is absolutely the best Italian sausage! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is okay, but the rest of the food is pretty good & the prices are good for how huge the portions are! The sandwiches, salads, and pastas are all good (Oregano's favorite, Chicago Italian Sausage, Big O'Vedge). The service is usually okay. Not bad for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Got the big rig pasta with meatballs. Was absolutely amazing! We were served by Paige and she was an incredible server. Food is always the best. Keep up the good work Paige!"}
{"text":"I took my family visiting from out of state here one afternoon, and we all agreed it was the best thing ever. The price, portions, taste, and service were all on point. Jedediah was an amazing server, and taught me that I like brussel sprouts well done. Will be back every future trip to Cave Creek I make!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place to eat!  No matter how busy?  Service is amazing!  The chicken Caesar small is enough for four. We are new here from LA and trying to find a new Italian restaurant has been tough!  We live coming here!  We enjoy once a week!  Great pizza and so thankful we discovered this place!  Andrew is the best!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We arrived at 9:30pm and asked if it was too late to eat - they close at 10pm.  We were told no - come in in!  I ordered the Alfredo the Dark pasta and it was horrible.  No tomatoes whatsoever and the bread had - no kidding - what tastes like barbecue sauce on it.  The server was even embarrassed. Ugh.  

Babbo - we love you!"}
{"text":"Gosh, I spent about 2 hours here, but enjoyed every second of it thanks to some amazing food.

We started off with some calamari and wings. While I'm not a big fan of calamari, I absolutely LOVE wings. Oregano's wings were pretty damn amazing. It has to be up there with the top 1% of wings I've tried. The timing of the appetizers was pretty nice as well. Calamari came out first, then the wings shortly after, and finally...

THE AMAZING PIZZA. wow. the chicago pan crust pizza was simply perfection. everything was perfect about it. the only downside was that it came straight out of the oven to our table, and so if you tried to get a slice everything would fall off. My advice would be to wait for the pizza to cool off before you even attempted to take a slice. Other than that, try not to cream in your mouth from the orgasm you'll have from eating this slice of amazingness. Seriously, it is perfect in so many ways. The crust has an amazing texture, the cheese is perfectly melted, the toppings aren't crap, and the sauce is the pinnacle of evolution and mother nature.

To top off all of this, it was cheap. I think we paid $20 for calamari, 9 wings, and a 10\" pan pizza with 2 sodas. Now I'm confused if that is actually how much we paid...

I suppose the one thing we didn't try was the pizza cookie...oh well, now I have an excuse to go back."}
{"text":"This Oregano's location is like the Anti-Oregano's of the Phoenix area.  It is very spacious, there's a lot of available parking, and when I was here there wasn't a long wait for seating.  The food is like any other Oregano's location: Tasty with large portions.  I'm still a bit dubious of the notion of \"Chicago thin-crust pizza,\" when I'm so used to Chicago deep dish, and also the fact that the pizza looks like a St. Louis style Imo's Pizza with different cheese.  But, no matter what you get, rest assured you won't leave starving!  

I've had pizzas, pizookies, various appetizers, and sandwiches here, and for the most part I've been pretty satisfied with the food.  My latest order was the veggie sandwich, which came with large slices of marinated portabella mushroom, cheese, tomatoes, basil, and lettuce.  Even though I ordered the junior size, it was still a hefty portion and I could only finish half of it!  The sweet potato fries were interesting in that they were dusted with cinnamon, adding a sweet dessert-like element to them.

Our server was great and provided refills as needed.  I would say out of all the locations, this one is probably the best one!"}
{"text":"This place is always ridiculously busy.  Their food, pretty good, but due to the wait that is usually involved I usually steer clear of this place.  We went here very early (~4 PM) for our large party to get seated and there wasn't too much of a wait, but if I have to always go here at 4 to be seated without a really long wait, there's no way I would eat here.  We had an appetizer, pizza, and dessert.  The appetizer was the GuacaTony, which was amazing.  It had a very large portion of fresh guacamole with perfectly crispy cheesy pizza/flatbread to eat it with.  I also had some of the toasted ravioli which was nicely breaded and toasty, with a bit of spicy kick to it.  I wasn't too impressed with the pizza though.  We had ordered a pizza on the thin crust wheat, and it looked like a bunch of pizza toppings placed on a large, circular cracker.  The wheat crust was not very flavorful and was burnt in a few areas.  The pizza cookie was rich, decadent, and delicious, although I highly recommend sharing this with at least 2 other people."}
{"text":"Pizza night at Oregano's with the family, we've been going to this one for years! Always a great experience, best thin crust pizza in Scottsdale. The salads, especially the Oregano's original are huge and we get one to share before the pizza arrives. Great food at a great price. A lot of options on the menu so everyone gets what they want. The kids always get the warn Pizookie for dessert too. We love to eat on the patio on a nice day. The only drawback is the wait for this location, it's always 45-1 hour and they don't take reservations for 4. Luckily the Cactus location that just opened is a little better for wait and not too far away to dash over to if the wait here is too long."}
{"text":"This place is too damn busy. It's pretty ridiculous to have wait an hour or more on a weeknight to get into this place. Sure if this was an upscale restaurant that was on another level then other Italian food places then I can justify the wait, but in my opinion it's not. Obviously I am one of the few people who doesn't think this place is that great. Once you are seated at an Italian restaurant most places have complimentary bread or something to hold you over for a while especially when you are waiting forever to get your food. To be fair they have $4 garlic bread which is pretty huge and tasty. As someone who drinks a lot of soda I appreciated the massive drink cups they have. The food came out and a few people were underwhelmed that they waiting as long as they did for what they got. The staff was friendly so that was at least nice. The parking in this location is terrible. On most nights you are forced to find parking in a dirt parking lot because there are too many people there. I have been here a few times and every time it was just decent. Nothing has ever blown me away about this place. I think it is overrated."}
{"text":"Busy. Oreganos is always busy. People are still coming in 5 minutes to close. It is in a great location in downtown Gilbert which is my favorite area to eat at.  The service is pretty good. I love those big cups they have. For someone like me who always needs refills it cuts down on that quite a bit. (Protip: ask to take a cup home. They had no problem with it, surprisingly) You have to get the Garlic bread. It is huge and tastes amazing. Deep dish pizza is where it's at. Sure it takes 45 minutes they say for the pizza to be ready, but shoot enjoy your company for a bit. What is the rush? There pizza is so good. I could care less about the price. Their sauce is so flavorful and their sausage is high quality. Desserts here are amazing. You have to try them at least once."}
{"text":"I  tried Oregano's for the first time recently and was amazed by the quality of food and portion sizes that they give! I got the bruschetta and the Originals Salad in the junior size + Chicken and was absolutely stuffed! The food is so delicious it made it as the first entry on my food blog! I have been in AZ twice in the last month and made sure to go back for the second time.

{"text":"Woah, Nellie! Is there anything better than Oregano's? The parking situation could be improved and the place gets crowded fast (a sign of a good establishment) , so try to get there right at 11:00 when they open if you are planning a lunch. Dinner time? Fuggedaboutit!  You will have a wait...

The pizza is always a good option. The slices are huge and one will typically fill up even a big guy like me. Maybe add a small salad if you must. I also enjoy the Big Rig Pasta. Lately I have been trying to be less of a big guy and instead, have ordered the salad. I have never attempted a full size and typically can only come close to finishing the half portion. The Pablo Picaso Mexican Salad is good, as is Mrs. Gibbilini's Original Spinach Salad - but my favorite is the Vino Bambino.

Hint - don't eat it all! Save room for dessert because there are fewer things on Earth I have experienced that are better than the Original Pizza Cookie. YUMMY! It's best not to be in a hurry because the cookie takes about 15 minutes to prepare - but its well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great food with reasonably priced kids menu and lunch items. I thought it was odd that my server Danielle did not offer to replace a slice of my sons pizza that she dropped on the floor though. It was comical to watch her act like she didn't see it fall until I picked it up with a napkin. She did offer to throw it away but never mentioned a replacement or a discount on my tab. I did not create a fuss about it because my son would never have eaten it all anyway. I think that the quality of food at Oreganos trumps a negative experience with my service. I will go back to Oreganos and would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a awesome food and cold drinks!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at an Oregano's. My wife had been bragging it up for a while and we finally went. We were a group of six and the restaurant was busy so there was a wait but nothing unreasonable. We were able to get drinks from the bar as we waited. 

Our server was really nice and attentive for the most part. We had wanted to get a deep dish pizza but were told it would be about an hour wait. Our server told us that we could have preordered the pizza while we waited for our table but we weren't aware we could do that ahead of time. We decided to get thin/pan crust.  The pizza was awesome! So far it is my favorite pizza in the Phoenix area. I will go back for a deep dish pizza when we have more time to wait."}
{"text":"Great food and service, but the told us they would not seat us until the whole party was there. We were only missing one person, but then they let 3 girls walk in to their table and said \"you've already been seated you are right this way\". I thought that was a little strange. Also, it was 106 degrees out and usually they have someone walking around asking if anyone wants a drink, no one came and the staff just looked at us while we waited. Usually I have never had this problem here, but tonight was very off."}
{"text":"We ordered a carry out from the Elliot Rd location due to Yelp-we aren't from the area and do not have Oregano's in our area- and it was completely awesome!!  The girl at the carry out desk couldn't have been more helpful.  She thought of everything, giving us plates and napkins due to her inquiring and finding out we were staying in a hotel not far away.  We were so impressed with everything overall I called in and spoke to the manager and let him know how great everything was.  Every business should treat its customers the way this one does!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best dine-in pizza place in town!  Good for groups and a dog-friendly patio too. We like their thin crust variety, but the deep pan one we got last night was really good too. Service by Andrew was just what we liked; not too in-your-face, but there when we needed him.  All round a great evening."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place mostly for carryout since shortly after it opened.  I mainly bought the pizza.  I noticed a while back that they were skimping on the toppings somewhat, but after my last visit, they are off the list.  I ordered a large numero uno and it was awful.  I'm not sure if they even put sauce on it.  The toppings were very limited ( as I could only see or taste onions and sausage ) and it cost $28 for this garbage.  Being from Chicago, I have some experience with pizza and this ain't it!  You've ruined a good thing folks!  Enjoy your profits!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love this place everytime I am in AZ it is a must. Great food and service.  The wings and pizza are amAZing...from thin crust to deep dish. Go early."}
{"text":"Pesto bruschetta is a must in the beginning and the pizza cookie for the end, your choice for the main course!

The wait for lunch and dinner is always a bitch.  It's just something you accept.  Get there at 11am on the dot for lunch and perhaps a late dinner time."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Nothing spectacular. I went in by myself so I took a seat at the bar. I ordered a big salad and although it was big it was lacking toppings for the amount of lettuce. There were 4 croutons, 2 thin slices of tomatoes and sliced onion. I ordered the shrimp scampi with the chipotle sauce. The portion was good but most of my shrimp was over cooked. It had that rubbery texture while biting and chewing it. I feel 3 stars is appropriate.

The bartender Kassandra was great. It was busy and I was a single person eating but she was very attentive and awesome. I would give Kassandra 5 stars."}
{"text":"It's no hint that Oregano's Pizza Bistro is a big contender in Arizona when it comes to pizza and Italian food. When the food comes out correct it's fantastic, but order it at your own risk. We use to frequent Oregano's Pizza Bistro 2-3 times per week, but not anymore since they've made changes to their menu and their ingredients. I think poor management is also a factor in multiple locations. We went in to this location yesterday and they messed up our order once again. It seems this is a constant issue with locations in the north valley, whether we dine in or take out. I will admit, Oregano's Pizza Bistro used to be my favorite restaurant a few years ago. Lately, mishaps like this though are more consistent and obviously are not good for business. Consistency is key with anything! Oregano's Pizza Bistro locations are becoming less busy lately no matter what day of the week it is and issues like this need to be addressed before it's too late."}
{"text":"Two years ago we attempted to get Take-Out but alas to no avail.  To summarize the issues here is the body of the email I sent to guestservices@oreganos.com:

Dear Sir/Madam,

This evening at 5:30PM I called to order take out and before the woman even asked what we wanted she stated: \"Just so you know the earliest it can be ready is 7:30PM, will that work for you?\".  Well 2 hours did not work for us.  This was the first and last time we tried Oreganos.  The location was:

Oregano's Pizza Bistro
6738 W Bell Rd
Glendale, AZ

This wait time is unacceptable and we felt like they were blowing us off and did not want our business.  I felt she should have asked first what we wanted before saying it would take two hours.

Cordially,
(my name & phone number)

Well fast forward to today as I'm cleaning up my email folders I'm reminded their Guest Services never even bothered to reply to me email from 8/15/2015.  Really Guest Services? what a joke.  Chains are generally a joke and this one is no exception.  Let's see if they bother to reply to this review.

Top 10 examples of poor service:

  1.  Lack of manners
  2.  Rude discourteous behavior
  3.  Long waits on the phone
  4.  Long waits in line
  5.  Lack of knowledge of the product or policy
  6.  Lack of follow-through
  7.  Not resolving a complaint
  8.  Unresponsive technology or not knowing how to use it
  9.  Can't get a hold of a real person
 10. Unfulfilled promises, lies and other deceptions

{"text":"Normally I love Oreganos. I was very disappointed with the service our table revived today. There were only 3 of us, but our drinks were mixed up, it took over 15 minutes for our server to even take our orders. She did not come and check on us, and all of our iced teas ran out as we were eating. When we finally got our checks, the wrong items were in the checks so we had to ask her to fix them. One of the members of our party had to ask 4 times for an iced tea to go. The server brought our check without asking if we wanted desert. We were going to order desert but opted not to, as we figured we wouldn't get it until 30 minutes later again, plus after she dropped off our checks we never saw her again. The only reason I gave 3 stars was because the food was great as it usually is no matter which location I've been to. I can say I will not return to this location based on the service I received. We came at 12pm on a weekend, but it was not that busy and there was not a wait."}
{"text":"Don't go here. Too crowded already. Fun and good food. Gosh what more do you want from a Restaurant?"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Just go early cause the wait gets long!! Guacatony is an appetizer you can't go wrong with!! The pizza is awesome, especially the the Chicago deep dish (but order it in advance)! One slice is a meal. The sausage sandwich is to die for!! But leave room for the pizzookie!!!! It will be the best thing you ate all week. We live for this. And if you have kids they bring out dough for them to play with! Plus the fortune cookies & mints at the front provide a great distraction during the wait as well. This location is a favorite of ours-- no parking issues!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place ever for pizza & a salad!! Love the pizookie!! The sausage or meatball subs are incredible. The dinner salad with chicken & Italian dressing are my go-to!! You can't go wrong with a good 'ole sausage pizza!! Just watch out for the wait on weekends! Lunch is a great time to go!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service all the way around at this location.  I feel like I'm on vacation when I eat here.  Leave early to get in, but the wait doesn't feel to bad.  The hosts make you feel welcome.  The only bad thing about this place would be the floors.  Super slippery.  Be prepared to fall on your booty."}
{"text":"The best wings in Arizona... hands down.  Their pizza is very good, and they make rib-eye / romaine / crispy onion salad that is amazing called the Beefstro.  We've been here more than 2 dozen times, and never had a bad experience.  Yes, you will have to wait up to an hour or more if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, or most nights during the peak (non-summer) season, but that should tell you something.  There is a reason why you have to wait an hour at Oregano's while the joint next door has a sandwich board sign out front proclaiming 'no wait here!'"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took us so long to try Oregano's.  We stopped by after our Ikea trip on Saturday and had some seriously delicious food.

We started with the garlic bread and marinara, very yummy but I really wish it came out cut.

I ordered the Bistro Classic pizza which was amazing, the tomatoes were plentiful and delicious. The rest of the family ordered the lasagna and the Italian sausage sandwich (Jr size), both were raved about.  Serving sizes are huge, we'll do more sharing next time without a doubt.  Also prices are very reasonable.  I was shocked to see our bill come out to under $50, I hadn't really paid attention to the prices when ordering and just expected it to be around $60.

Service left a bit to be desired but it was alright, and it's really loud in there, which I didn't love."}
{"text":"Their big rig with sausage is to die for! It is so delicious I wish I could have it all the time. But since it is kind of pricey, I tend to get it less than I would like. The service is always good here but wait times to get a table on the weekend nights are kind of long sometimes so come early!"}
{"text":"Loved the service!!! Juan was our waiter and he was the best! Smile on his face ear to ear and he explained the menu! We will go back because of the service. The food was about a 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"4 STARS- Oregano's Favorite salad; this was delicious.  It had a subtle, sweet dressing with pine nuts, raisins, olives, feta, sundried tomatoes, lettuce, and roasted red peppers. I'd go back again for this! I'll definitely be back to try the Kale Caesar salad. 

The pizza....meh.  2.75 stars. The flavors were just okay. I would've expected a lot more from a popular pizza joint.  I've had much better Chicago-style pizza."}
{"text":"Customer service was so fast and the waitress I had was so nice and wasn't just a waitress, she made conversation. Definitely going there again"}
{"text":"Great pizza !! And the giant meatballs were worth coming back for ! A bit slow on the service but overall highly recommended."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would strictly because of the service. Oregano's does not take reservations or call ahead for seating, which is fine if this location would be able to accommodate large parties. This location was NOT busy, however there was no option to seat us together because they have only one option to move tables together to seat large parties? The option they gave us was back-to-back booths. For a birthday party with family in town this is obviously not ideal. Instead of trying to accommodate us and figure out a more reasonable seating option, the manager simply said, \"have a nice day.\"- loosing out on a $200 ticket. My family and I will NOT be back at this location."}
{"text":"Oregano's has become a family favorite! 
Yummy food in a fun and casual environment. 
If you're in the mood for a tasty frozen cocktail then the ORiGiNAL GiBBiLiNi BELLiNi is a must try! 
Starters I'd recommend the HUGE
GUACA-TO (Italian guacamole made to order with fresh avocado) served with pizza crust chips. 
If you're a avocado lover like myself then this is must try! Another favorite is the ITALIAN FRIED ZUCCHINI! Or the SWEET N' SPICY hot wings served with homemade potato chips. 
If it's pasta you want then definitely recommend trying the ZANY ZITI (Ziti pasta, red sauce, and four Italian cheeses. Topped with even more cheese, baked in a bread bowl)! I love that this dish is baked in a bread bowl yet still comes with a slice of garlic bread! And of course you just can't go wrong with one of Oregano's famous deep dish pizzas."}
{"text":"Oreganos is our weekly spot. We have gotten to the point where the servers know us, and it truly is an amazing joint. You will always receive great service, and great food. Esteban & Chris are probably some of the best servers we have ever had anywhere! Amazing atmosphere & place. The Alfredo in the dark is amazing, it comes with a roasted jalepeno on top and we have it removed. The big rig is also killer! From the pizzas, pastas, apps and salad, theres not a dish that isnt amazing!"}
{"text":"This was the BEST service I've had in awhile. We were always checked up in and taken care of. Drinks were hardly empty for long. Staff was friendly. An all over amazing experience for my birthday dinner. So glad this was the restaurant that was chosen. They were amazing!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain. But it is far better than any pizza chain you've ever tried. Three things you should try that are top notch:
1) the garlic bread with cheese and marinara. Crazy good, and huge. Really.
2) Clark Street Pizza . Several meats on a thing crust and well peppered pizza. Really really tasty.
3) the gigantic pizza cookie.. it's awesome.

I used to dread going to the Oregano's location in Scottsdale or Gilbert. They were always busy and had long wait times. This new location in Superstition Springs area is great, across from the local Harkins , and almost never a long wait.

Love it !"}
{"text":"Love Oregano's :) 

The 45 minute wait for deep dish pizza does not bother me much because I know I am going to get it just the way I like it. Lots of pepperoni and easy sauce. The BBQ wings are so good. They are crispy, hot, and bathed in sauce. Service at Oregano's has never failed me. In Tucson, AZ and in Phoenix, AZ service is great :)"}
{"text":"Oregano's is great. Besides the typical longer wait time I have nothing negative to say about this place. Everything from the atmosphere to the pazookie is awesome. My favorite dinner combo is the antipasto salad, bistro pizza and top everything off with a half chocolate chip-half macadamia nut pazookie. Try it,  you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is great as long as you know what you are in for. Disclaimer - I went during spring break so that might explain the wait. The wait for a table seemed like it would be a while - over an hour I would guess. I did not have to wait as some friends had gotten there before me but there was quite a line queue. The parking lot is not big enough to accommodate all of the people who want to park there. I parked a few blocks east at a strip mall. Ordered the stuffed numero-oneo. It was a 12 inch pie that easily fed 3 with leftovers and I can put down some pizza. It was the best pizza I have had in years. Highly recommended.   The wait for this pizza was over and hour. I would see if you can call ahead or order in line. We also has the bruschetta appetizer that was pretty good."}
{"text":"The positive: Food is delish!  The El Diablo Shrimp Pasta has a good kick to it! Don't try it if you don't love spicy food.  A good alternative is the Lady is a Scampy shrimp corkscrew pasta. Equally delish without the burn. 

The negative: the hostess was horrible at estimating wait time. We were told 25-35 minutes, but ended up waiting almost 50 minutes! (On a random Monday night) They don't have indoor tables for parties of more than 4 or 5. So, if your party is 6 or more, either you sit outside or wait until two tables next to each other are free. Definitely not a restaurant for a large party."}
{"text":"Not all salads are created equal. Seinfeld has the \" Big Salad.\" Oregano's has the \"Pablo Picasso.\" 

Now, I know it's weird that I'm leaving a review for a salad at a Pizza Bistro... but stay with me here. I wasn't really in the mood for pizza when i was eating here with family so I ended up ordering this salad instead. First off, it was huge! And it was delicious! The tomatoes, peppers, and chicken were awesome. 

I'm telling ya... if you want to have a good salad I highly recommend the Pablo Picasso!"}
{"text":"I had family in town and we were trying to think of a new place to go eat. After hearing friends talk about Oreganos, I convinced my family to give it a try. It did NOT disappoint!

We were seated fairly quickly (considering it as a Saturday night) and our server was super nice. After ordering some drinks and looking through the menu, we decided to order a couple of pizzas and share. Wow! The pizza was great! There was a total of 10 of us, so we ordered two 18\" and one 12\" pizzas. The thin crust was my personal favorite. As good as the pizza was, I definitely want to try a pasta dish next time.

Lastly, the atmosphere was solid. Good food, good drinks, and a nice atmosphere are all you can ask for at a restaurant. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Oregano's for a while now. Usually a good experience but on my last visit the service was very slow and the server said they no longer include the kids drink with the kids meal. That makes it a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and we absolutely loved it!!!  Brianna was the most fabulous waitress!!! Ainslee was also on he patio and not our waitress, but so sweet and helpful.  Dillon (aka Dominic Sherwood)  was very helpful as well and entertaining!  That's just the staff....the food was amazing!!!  I have recommended this location to several people and will continue to do so!!!  This will be our go to spot!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since the start....last night dinner..hardly any sauce on pasta (2orders) and the bruschetta---tomatoes were in large and I mean large chunks...with very little else...nothing like they use to make.  I deal with overly loud music but might be a time to look for a new place."}
{"text":"For some reason, I had a ridiculous craving for Chicago style deep dish pizza.  Like almost a physical urge to eat that thick, gooey, filling style of pie.  So we found ourselves braving the crowds (we went at 5pm and there was an hour wait!) because folks said Oregano's had good deep dish pizza.  

First, can I talk about the menu?  What is this, a theme restaurant in Vegas?  The person who wrote this menu should be stoned (and probably was when he wrote it) for all the terrible, chintzy, schlocky, names and descriptions of food.  

Anyway, they do a pretty decent job of managing the crowd and getting folks drinks while they wait in the large, open patio area, and a table opened up soon enough.  We started with a large, family style salad which was mostly lettuce.  Then the pizza came, and it was everything I hoped it would be.  Sure, it's not Giordano's, but it was seriously the next best thing.  It was thick and gooey and exactly what I was looking for.  We had the numero one-o (sigh...) and the amount of toppings, and the pounds and pounds of cheese hit the right spot.  The crust was a little tough to get through with the butter knife provided, but that's my only complaint about the pizza.  It was even good as a thick cheese brick the next day.

So I'm going to take a star off for the seriously embarrassing menu, and for the fact that you cannot come here and not wait for a table, and the mediocre salad.  But that deep dish pizza is the real deal, far away from Chicago."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  My brother lives in Gilbert and his family worships this place.  We've been three times in as many years.  While the ambiance is fun and pub-like, the staff generally fun and friendly, and the service reasonably good, the food is on par with other locally-owned chains we've eaten at.  Oregano's has the feel of a place that probably started off as a great place but has gotten too big for its britches.  The result is a place that comes across as a bit commercialized and not as homey as they want it to feel.  The salad's are insanely huge, we're talking the size of a mound of hay for a horse.  Seriously.  All of the food here is good to very good.  We'll continue to visit because it's a fun place to enjoy each other's company."}
{"text":"Was my first time coming in and loved it. The pizza was awesome and I loved my cookie ice cream dessert at the end!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is go see Sullivan inside. I was so impressed by his service. The Foods always great but Sullivan took the cake."}
{"text":"I like Oreganos. For what it is. the service is ALWAYS stellar. they accommodate every type of party that walks in the door. I give any business kudos for that. The food is good. Not GREAT, but good. I've had several items since moving here in January 2012. The portions are absolutely enormous. Be warned. The JR salads are still enough to share. I've had the thin crust pizza, which to me was standard zaa... Good sauce, nice amount of cheese. Standard for a thin crust. The Chicago stuffed was another story.. I was really looking forward to this one since I saw the neighboring table chow down. We ordered a basic pizza with pepperoni, sausage and caramelized onions. It came looking amazing! And it wasn't bad, it was just loaded with so much cheese that it took over any toppings one might like to enjoy. Another minus (for me) was that instead of their nummy sausage chunks it was layered with enormous slices of sausage to the point where besides the sick amount of cheese that was all you could taste. It by no means was inedible but be warned. I wouldn't order it again and it was NOT Chicago style. I've also had their Diablo shrimp pasta dish and sadly it was great the first time and not even spicy the next. I will still eat here as it is a great place to chill and get some grub but if your looking for Chicago zaaaa... find somewhere else...

All in all, a good standard place to eat, exremely nice servers and decent food. just not what I want when I think of the good ol Midwest pizza."}
{"text":"I've had good service here in the past, but today it was nonexistent...literally. 

I brought my young niece and nephew (after driving to three separate restaurants for breakfast that were mobbed), and we finally conceded and settled for lunch. 

The restaurant was probably 1/4 full, and there were at least two young waitpersons standing nearby, talking and laughing. After some time passed, they were still at it talking and laughing. More time passed. I established eye contact with 2 servers. We were still ignored. Mind you, nobody had even been by to get our drink order. Nobody had even said someone would be with us soon. More time passed. I may have been more patient had I not already been very hungry with two hungry kids in tow. However, that's a compelling reason to go to a restaurant in the first place. Last I checked, that's how they make their money.

I've never left a restaurant because I was ignored. The manager was very apologetic and offered to serve us herself, but I wasn't in the mood to watch these girls yakking and ignoring others as I ate.

If I could, I wouldn't have even rated this place any stars. Newsflash: the amount of your tip is heavily influenced by good customer service or the lack thereof, 'ladies.'"}
{"text":"Man this place is the Bomb..
Had the Toasted Ravioli,  house Caesar Salad & two different pizzas. 

I highly suggest u come here. I know we will again.

The staff is nice, the manager walked around asking how we are doing even the building layout was welcoming."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the service was great. Unfortunately, we sat out on the patio where there was absolutely no air flow and it was uncomfortable. It would be really nice if you don't have a misting system to at least have some fans."}
{"text":"I searched Phoenix area high and low for some great deep dish pizza. I finally found it. Not over priced and delicious. The salads are very well priced and huge. I am definitely going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Went here while on vacation. It was very good food and also very good service. I had lasagna which is a bit different than other places and really good. They also gave us free desert since it was our first visit there."}
{"text":"A good local chain.  Food was plentiful.  My side salad to my entree was huge!  I also had the baked Ziti in a bread bowl.  I couldn't eat it all.  Very tasty.  The server recommended to customize the dish to my taste.  I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"5 Stars/ 2 Thumbs up!  

Awesome food, portions and price. My favorite: \"Oregano's Favorite\" Salad, Sweet Potato Fries and Chicken, Chedder, Broccoli Pan Pizza.  Competent and friendly staff and management.  Servers are very attentive to your needs. Entertaining, easy to read menu with a large variety of items.  Aesthetically pleasing and unique decor. Motorcycle friendly with it's own reserved motorcycle parking lot. Beautiful Outdoor patio.  Check out their website, it's pretty cool.  And, don't forget the famous Pizza Cookie!

Pro's:

1. FOOD:  Mama Mia, I think I've died and woke up in Oregano's heaven.  

2. Service and staff:  They are attentive to your needs, have personality, and make you feel right at home. 

3. Highly Visible Management: Not afraid to get their hands dirty. Always walking around and available to you. 

4. Outdoor dining:  Cave Creek location has one of the nicest outdoor dining patios around.  A big Mesquite tree covers the patio for shade.

5.  Reserved motorcycle parking: I'm not talking about a few spaces.  This location has it's own motorcycle parking \"lot\" overlooking the beautiful outdoor patio. 

6.  The bar:  It's kind of like a small version of Cheers.  Cold, tall beers on draft. Try the Bellini.

Cons:

1.  No outdoor bar:  

2.  No misters on Patio.

3.  Busy.  This place is top notch, so you have to expect that.  It is worth the wait though. Put your name on the list, then take a drive into Cave Creek for a bit to check out the town.  Or just go for a scenic walk while your waiting.

3.  It's a bit cold inside.  Ladies, bring a light jacket.

4.  No WiFi."}
{"text":"I've traveled far and wide for Italian and this is by far the most incredible restaurant I have ever been to. 

Let's start at square one - Bellini had a round for the table and this was like a slurped on crack. The peachy frozen margarita twist on this champagne favorite is something to die for. 

Square 2 - calamari. I'm pretty sure these squids swam right out of the Atlantic into a deep frying pan of heaven doused with a twist of lemon and homemade marinara. 

The final course - you have to have the big rig, a light pink panther sauce with a chipotle kick, You would have thought Ronaldo himself served up. Have it with chicken and an extra slice of there mouth watering garlic bread 

If you live AZ, you like Italian food, but you haven't been here ...... FITFO"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered take out tonight and the service was incredible! Our order was perfect, the food tasted fantastic and Calvin the take out employee was attentive, quick and made our experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"To start with, this is my first time at this location and possibly my last. I live on this side of town and every time I pass this place it's usually busy, however, tonight me and my girlfriend thought we would give it a try. Upon arriving we were told it would be a 30 minute wait for two which didn't seem that bad. Instead we ended up waiting almost 50 minutes just to be seated due to the hostess totally forgetting about us. Now I could understand this happening if we were outside but we actually sat right in front of her inside. How she could look at us and not wonder why we haven't been seated while she's seating other customers who clearly showed up after us is mind boggling. After mentioning something we were seated immediately but without apology which is unfortunate because she knows she messed up and so do we.

After sitting down, we were approached by our waitress and she took our orders. Now I'm a vegetarian and my girlfriend is a vegan and our waitress assured us that our orders would be meat free as well as dairy and egg free for my girlfriend. Turns out that their base marinara sauce is mixed with cheese and that the chef could make another based off of a tomato puree mix they have which we begrudgingly agreed to. Anyways, we get the food, my plates spicy but is ok. The pasta for my girlfriend though was bland and plain, due to the chef just blending the puree, no spices or anything to spruce it up, that's just lazy.

First impression of this place sucked so far, probably won't go back which means I'll just stick with Olive Garden or Buca Di Beppo. Overall, needs more attentive hostesses, and waitress or chef who have better knowledge of what they're serving."}
{"text":"For years I had wanted to try this chain but never wanted to wait.  After finally going I really don't understand why the big fuss.  The food is decent, sure.  But after waiting 30+ minutes for a table, to be told anything signature (like deep dish pies, lasagna, etc) are an additional 45 minute wait after ordering it can be frustrating to say the least.  We weren't able to decide on a pie for the two of us so he got some lasagna that was way too meaty and I opted for a thin crust pizza.  

I like the ball of dough they give to the kids to keep them busy, but of course with the wait for the food this is a necessity and not a luxury.  

The service itself is top notch.  I have no qualms about that part of the meal.  Attentive and helpful from the wait staff to management.  In fact, we filled out the the comment card expressing our disappointment and barely made it out the door before the manager caught up with us and wanted to discuss our meal.  He gave us a gift card because he wanted us to try it a second time.  We later used the gift card for to-go orders.  Had a couple salads (one was the beefstro) which still didn't really impress.  

Will I ever try again?  Sure, but as a couple or with another couple with the expectation that dinner will last a minimum of two hours.  However, will this be a regular destination?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Growing up in Chicago, I think I can safely say I know Chicago style pizza.  It's in my blood.  I've been going to Oregano's for years since living in Phoenix and it never fails to impress me from location to location.  It's Chicago style all the way!  

This past weekend we decided to dine at the Paradise Valley location and again we were very well taken care of.  From the greeting you receive when you walk in the door to the service and staff.  It's always pleasant.   What really is something that isn't new to the restaurant business but Oregano's does so well is during the meal, a manager stops by to make sure everything is going well.  A manager, who was actually quite funny, came out and not just to ask \"How is everything\". No she genuinely made sure all was good made us feel like we are being taken care of.  In a busy restaurant like this to have that kind of attention is impressive.  One thing I have to say is a stand out for me and is so incredibly important is consistency. It's the reason I've been going to Oregano's for years and will continue for years to come.  
We had the Stuffed Numero One.  What I would normally call \"Deep Dish\" in Chicago.  I still get confused about how to order that, but I digress.  It's a larger pizza and when you order it they always tell you it will take 45 min's.  Our server was great about coming back and checking to make sure we were doing ok, filling drinks and making sure all was good.  

The best part of the night?  Leftovers!

If you're looking for great pizza, excellent service and a nice evening out do yourself a favor and go to Oregano's!"}
{"text":"Great food and great outside dining. If I could afford the carbs I'd eat here more often. The staff is always friendly - 

Sometimes too friendly... :)

While eating a meal there, the male waiter came up and asked my 15 yr. old son \"Can I get that for you babe?\" Then he froze and said \"I just called you babe, didn't I?\" 

We laughed all the way home."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, they tried to seat 3 of us at a 2 top table so, we opted for seats at the bar. RICHARD our bartender was awesome! Made great suggestions. 

The Big Caesar salad was huge, the portabella mushrooms are awesome and the Pizookie was really tasty.  I'd totally make a meal of the mushrooms next time. Passion ice tea was refreshing."}
{"text":"Love the Italian gold wings. Pasta was good this time too! Ac was not working well so super hot. Really rough for the kids"}
{"text":"In Tempe for the ASU game and was referred to Oregano's in Tempe by a friend.  Not only was the food fantastic, the bartender/ Mr awesome, Sullivan was the best bartender/restaurant employee we have ever had!!  He catered to EVER customer!! He made me a jalapeño margarita, which is not on the menu, and kept spicing it up to my satisfaction...better experience than we could have asked for!  Sullivan is THE MAN! And holy cow the Pablo Picaso salad was fantastic.  Again, highly recommending this place. Icing on the cake? Have Sullivan take care of you!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to the different Oregano's locations for years now. The food here is delicious! I'd recommend the pizza cookie, angel hair pasta, spinach artichoke dip, etc. The atmosphere and decor give the place a great feel and the old music and black 'n' white 50's movies are awesome. Their specialty drinks are strong, which is good, but might be too sweet for some.

I'd recommend this place for groups or a date. Friendly service from the hostess to servers.  Plus they have fun sayings on their shirts, which you can buy, like \"Wanna Pizza Me\". Think about it.

Take note: 
--The parking lot is small, typical of most Oregano's locations, and be careful where you park around so you are not towed. 
--They do NOT take reservations, the wait can sometimes be long during lunch and dinner hours. 
--The only food criticism I have is of their baked sandwiches; the outer bread crust can be very hard making it difficult to eat and bite into."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I went here for lunch today after leaving a different restaurant due to a bad experience.  As we walked up the Hostess was smiling and pleasant. Our first Server however seemed like he was having a bad day. We requested to speak to a Manager. When he came over he was nonchalant and said \"what's up?\". We requested a different Server and we ended up with Mekah. She was awesome! She went over specials and shared her favorites and different options. She was smiling and enthusiastic. She was very attentive and made our dining experience a phenomenal one. During our meal another female Manager came out and offered us a dessert on the house. Our food was amazing (we ordered the Big Rig with meatballs, chicken and sausage). We were so impressed with Mekah and her female Manager that we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love the stuffed pizza!  Wife and I go to Oreganos about once a month and the pizza is stuffed with so much cheese that I love, it's amazing!  We started with some Italian gold wings which is honey mustard and bbq sauce combined!  Cannot get enough!  The cheesy bread and Mac and cheese are also SO great! And don't forget to end with their amazing cowboy cookie!  Baked perfectly warm with ice cream on top!  Cannot wait until our next visit!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food for good price for a large party."}
{"text":"Another one of my Scottsdale stops-I try to come here every time

I am not impressed with their pasta, but the pizza, salad, wings and sandwiches are all awesome. 

You might catch a ballplayer in there-Matt Cain was there when we ate and we heard Barry Zito was there earlier!"}
{"text":"Family loves this place but having two rambunctious kids it's hard to eat out. Because of this we order to go and my wife's pasta never seams to be the same as our dine in experience. 

To light on the sauce and never the same amount of meat."}
{"text":"Awesome quick service and delicious food! Love the pasta bread bowls! Close to shopping and freeway. Only thing is the wait time to get in is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Finally went to eat here after hearing about it over and over and over again from co-workers.  My husband and I went around 6pm on a Sat. and we waited approx. 30 minutes for a table.  This was one of the more pleasant waits at a restaurant that I have ever experienced.  

With plenty of seating around the bar, we were immediately approached by a friendly waitress who had our drinks back to us lickety-split.   I had the house Chianti, and the hubby had a Fat-Tire.  

We got a nice booth inside and had another friendly waiter who brought us samples of the house Sangria which I also ordered.  It was pretty tasty, not out of this world, but it was cold and refreshing.

We got the boom dip which was excellent and the Chicago style pizza.  The 10 inch is way more than enough for two people. Two things about this pizza, 1) The crust is buttery, crisp and delicious.  2)  The sauce had a little too much basil for my taste, but they are very generous with the cheese and other toppings.  We walked out of there with lots of left-overs.  

We did try the cookie dessert and it was tasty, but again, not out of this world.  I think a little less ice cream, and a little more cookie would be better.  

Overall, I would go back here, and maybe see this as a good place to take out of town guests (with the exception of the long waits).  The atmosphere is nice, great friendly staff, and good food."}
{"text":"I have to say the people in Phoenix really love their pizza.  On any given night, Pizzeria Bianco has a 2+hour wait, Cibo has an 1+ hour and then there's Oregano's with their ridiculously long wait as well!  

Several people had recommended Oregano's for their Chicago-style deep dish pie, so this particular Thursday night, my coworkers and I came here for their stuffed pizza which takes 45 minutes to bake!  Here's Oregano's menu description:  \"The \"piece de resistance\", we take a deep dish, add a light crust and fill it with cheese and fresh ingredients. We cover it with a layer of thin crust and top it with a tangy sauce. This \"stuff\" is so good, it'll take about 45 minutes, but it's worth it!\"  How could we resist?

So, we order a few things to nibble on to pass the time...
Mrs. Gibbilini's Original Spinach Salad
Wings of Fire
Bistro Classic Pizza
and of course, the stuffed Numero ONE-O Pizza

Salad, Wings, Classic Pizza....ok, nothing spectacular, usual chain restaurant tasting food.  An hour passes, where's the Numero ONE-O?  We ask our server, she tells us it's on its way.  Another 15 minutes, it looks delicious and HUGE!  One bite, it's still cold in the middle!  What!?!  No we don't want to wait for a new one!  

I wish we had gone to Cibo instead!"}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss! I have gone here twice in the last few months and im still up in the air about it. The first time the deep dish pizza was delicious! Tasted great, came out before they said it would (was worth the 45 min wait time told to us) waiter was on point and it was a good time. This last time I went with my sister it was a mad house (was a Tuesday night). People were coming and going, really loud, everyone standing inside because it was too hot to wait outside for a table, waiters running around running into each other dropping food. A lot of tension and pressure in the air for some reason. After we sat down we had 2 waitresses that were trying to be attentive but were not very good at it. They apologized a lot and we were there over 2 hours for 1 deep dish pizza and a cookie pizza to go. When the pizza came out, it was tasteless, bland and just blah. The stuffed mushrooms..... I dont even know how to describe those. They looked great and I feel had a lot of potential especially with the sausage and cheese...... but nope very bland and boring. Close to being done we ordered the pizza cookie to go, 3 apologizes later from both waitresses we finally got our bill and the cookie and left. It could have been an off night for everyone im not sure. But really not sure if I would go back. Sometimes the food is worth the wait and hassle, but after this visit im thinking Barros will take care of my pizza cravings. :/"}
{"text":"Paper-thin crust if you like that then this is the place for you.  

I paid $16 for a 18 inch pie that was average."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and full of smiles! Great food at a good price so you can't beat it! Their lasagna is something to look forward to! Only thing, weekends and most evenings expect a wait! But worth it!"}
{"text":"This location just isn't as good as the other ones!  My husband and I went to lunch around 11:30 am at Oregano's in Goodyear and were seated immediately.  That was the only \"quick\" part about our meal.  We waited over 20 minutes for a salad.  We then waited over 10 minutes for a bottled beer.  Our server messed up our single sandwich order not once, but twice - and the worst part is we never got an actual apology - just a \"I guess the third time's a charm!\"  And our third sandwich wasn't even hot all the way through.  At other locations the manager would have apologized, an iced tea would have been comped, the mistake at least acknowledged - something!  If they would have been busy I would have understood, but not even acknowledging the mess up is just not acceptable.  Sorry to say we don't plan on returning to this location any time in the near future."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem here... actually one of my favorite places to eat! But i just left now because i sat at the bar for 10 minutes and no one offered me anything:( they even asked the guy next to me if he needed anything else??"}
{"text":"Nice feel, good food organized and super accommodative  of a family with a special needs child . I could not be more impressed happy to give them our business."}
{"text":"We had a group of about 11 and came on a Sunday. We were told it was going to be a 20 min wait but ended up being seated before I was even served my drink! Great food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Cody is great, Ashlyn is great, Anna is great, Marvin is great. Heck the whole staff is great! Love the bolla pasta and Alfredo the dark. Cody went the extra mile to make our visit wonderful, as always. We either come in to much or your guys rememer us that makes it so much better we feel very welcome here. Thanks so"}
{"text":"Noooope. Not coming back.

15 minutes wait for a table that's been empty since before got there.

Food came out almost out of fridge cold. After three attempts at reheating, shrimp just turned to rubber.

Meatballs are super bland.

Manager is too busy to come out and talk?

No thanks."}
{"text":"My favorite place around! The service is always great and the food is delicious! I love the Alfredo in the dark it is amazing. The pizookies are also a must for desert. It can be a really long wait most of the time but it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"The food here is really delicious! The atmosphere is a good one too although it can be a bit loud depending on the day so be prepared for that. The restaurant is almost always busy so it's rare to walk in and immediately get a seat. The large majority of the staff working here are friendly and caring and there's lots to look at in terms of the decor. No complaints other than the long wait times, but that really speaks to their popularity, i think."}
{"text":"Our favorite bistro in surprise!!! Enjoy the oreganos favorite salad and the Ozone perfect combination! 
We have always gotten great service, our favorite Bar tender is Cari and waitress is Christy!! Excellent"}
{"text":"Went here last Thursday evening and sat at the bar. There seemed to be plenty people working they just yet were not attending to the customers. We have been here several times before and never experienced such poor service.   Our server actually started to debate whether I ordered garlic bread or cheese bread when the bread was brought out at the same time as the spaghetti. My salad came out when my husband was on his second bowl if spaghetti. The reason given was there were alot if to go orders and the salad line was backed up. So...should I have ordered my salad to go to get it sooner? We were very disappointed. While we typically enjoy our time and food...not this time! We are not looking forward to going back anytime soon. Sad because it can be a very good!"}
{"text":"Lived in AZ for two winters back in '07 and '08. I used to frequent the Oregano's establishment!  I went back last and it hasn't changed. Same great atmospher and same great pizza!  
Lastly, i don't care how full you are after your dinner, there is always room for one of their cookie pizzas!  SO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"The sauce was tasty but so salty we could only eat about a third of the largest size. Crust was crisp, but towards the center a little less crispy, we asked for New York style. I would not eat there again."}
{"text":"Food is great but an hour and half wait is too long.   Once seated we noticed empty tables that would sit 10minutes or more and they still have lots of peple waiting outside.   The thin crust pizza took over 1/2hour to get to a table.   Food is very good but the wait is ridiculous.   Rethinking coming back or go to other locations."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome, staff rocked, they took my order with 5 minutes till closing time. Never sounded like she was in a hurry or inpatient and threw in any extras asked for. Owners/managers yu you did a great job hiring awesome people. Thank you."}
{"text":"We went here for my daughter's birthday on a Friday night knowing it would be busy. It was, but the wait was not unreasonable. They came out and took drink orders while we were waiting which was nice. Every staff person we interacted with was super friendly. The food was delicious with generous portions and reasonable prices. I understand why they are so busy and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has fabulous food, great service, and the best background music. I only wish I lived close enough to eat here regularly. (I'm from another part of the country.) Clean, pleasant, and thoroughly enjoyable. Definitely merits a return visit!"}
{"text":"Yummy all around! The cookie cup is a delicious curse you randomly think of and NEED to have right then and there!"}
{"text":"This is the type of restaurant that all other restaurants should aspire to be like. Incredible food, amazing service, and I am never disappointed. They even do the small things like offer you a drink to go at the end of your meal. I hardly write reviews, but felt compelled to do so after so many great experiences here."}
{"text":"During a recent visit to the Old Scottsdale area I was hit with my usual pizza craving. This is always a good thing, one of my favorite pizza joints, Gimaldi's, is located just down the street from my hotel. Only this time I decided to give someone else's pizza a shot. I had seen Oregano's a number of times but had never stopped in. That was until now; I made a left instead of a right and hit Oregano's. It was a bit chilly but chose to sit outside since there were patio heaters. The outdoor seating area was quite nice, but a little close to the road making it a bit noisy. 

Looking at the menu I saw Oregano's offered numerous dishes, they all look very tasty. They also offer thick crust Chicago style pizza, in addition thin crust is also offered.  That's good because I'm a thin crust guy. Since this was my first visit I ordered thin crust cheese, in my view the basic cheese pizza is the true test for any pizzeria. After a short wait my pizza arrived. It looked very good, very thin crust but over dressed with cheese. Interestingly while it was the traditional round pie, it was cut into squares verse the usual wedges. However the real test is how it tastes. It was very good, better than most pizzerias. That said it wasn't perfect. It was over dressed with cheese, which in turn made it just a bit greasy. Still make no mistake, this is very good pizza, maybe even bordering on excellent. Yet there is on huge problem. Oregano's is located only about a mile from Gimaldi's. In my view Gimaldi's doesn't serve very good or even excellent pizza, they serve extraordinary pizza. Prices are virtually identical. For me it's a no brainer if in the area, its Gimaldi's for pizza. Maybe the only way I would choose Oregano's over Gimaldi's would be if I wanted something other than pizza. Oregano's also seems a bit more on the casual fun side.

At Oregano's you'll find a very good pie, just keep in mind if pizza is what you crave it isn't the best. The best lies only lies about a mile away."}
{"text":"Awesome place, we celebrated our 48th anniversary here this past Tuesday. They have very large portions there for my husband and I shared the Vino bambino chicken salad, the garlic chicken Parmesan lasagna. Then for dessert we shared a white chocolate macadamia pizza cookie top with three small scoops of vanilla gelato sprinkle with chocolate chips. They bake the cookie when you order it. It is fantastic. About half inch thick and crusty brown brownish on top and somewhat soft cookie inside."}
{"text":"i used to come here all the time with my family, right after work we'd head over here for some delicious pizza and AMAZING salad! Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad. was sent from heaven, one thing. I haven't actually had it since I became vegetarian a couple months ago, but the salad without chicken would not be a miss!! You may be curious to know why we haven't been here in so long, well just ONCE we saw a cockroach on the wall that grossed us out, and that's why this place loses a star. Other than that, I recommend it without a doubt. Thin crust pizza is way better than the deep dish here!"}
{"text":"Meat balls are fantastic and love, love, love the deep dish pizza, but be prepared to wait 45 mins for it. Patio is great! Serving sizes are enormous! Brent was extremely accommodating and friendly. Oreganos never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!!!! Definitely a favorite place to eat some great pasta and pizza. You can't leave with out having desert!!!"}
{"text":"long wait.. for a party of 6 on a not at all busy evening.. food is terrible.. found a roach in our pizza and the sausage had worms in it.. no more fckn gross piss a## place!!!!! stay away!"}
{"text":"This place was great. We sat at the outside bar and had good service. The slice, meatball sub, and chicken parm sandwiches were all excellent. Wish I lived in Phoenix and could come more often."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Real Italian food! Freshly made!! Pizza is great! Sandwiches are very big and filling. Their custom drinks are strong and delicious!! 
Great history to this place too!! Need to stop in!"}

Great history to this place too!! Need to stop in!"}
{"text":"Not what it use to be. Seems like the food does not have the kick it use to have. Been to the other Oreganos so we gave it a shot probably give it another chance but there's so much other competition"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite retaurants! The pasta is so delicious and their salads and garlic bread. The only thing I hate about it is how crowded it is!!! Just writing about it makes me crave it! The alfredo in the dark is definitely the most delicious!!"}
{"text":"Oreganos is the perfect restaurant for a family or a group. Generous portions, very tasty and friendly service. Their takeout is always phenomenal. Their thin crust cheese pizza is one of the best I have ever had. Their lady is a scampy and their alfredo in the dark are out of this world! This is also a great place to bring  out of town guests  but it is always super busy at all times!"}
{"text":"Oreganos what happened to you.. we've been going to the location on university in tempe for years, never had an issue with food quality.  My parents move to the west Valley and was so excited when oreganos moved out to Goodyear.  We've been 3 times to this location, the food quality at this location is beyond sub par.  We've eaten at the restaurant 2 times take out once.  Both times at the restaurant we had to talk to manager about the quality of the food and how it didn't relate to other oreganos in the valley.  Last night was our LAST time at this location.  We ordered for take out and had the antipasti salad, all we got was lettuce and tomatoes, no meat, artichokes, peppers..  NOTHING. The wings on the menu say jumbo, there was nothing jumbo about these wings, they were as baby as they could be.. I'm so disappointed in oreganos, we won't be back to this location EVER"}
{"text":"Parking can be challenging at times but it is worth the effort. Fun environment and great food. Salads are delicious and worth trying."}
{"text":"I know it's a staple of the area and my daughter has been trying to get us here multiple times; but I just don't get it.
The place is cramped and service is spotty.
Table next to us ordered a pizza and I looked over as they grabbed the slices off the tray.  I could tell the crust was not crisp, as even the small slices easily bent in their hands. Luckily, I ordered a sandwich and my kid had a salad.  The food was ok, but I have gotten better at many quick eat shops without the hassle of waiting for a table."}
{"text":"They did mess up on my pizza  but the manager was kind enough to fix the mistake. Well be returning."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a frozen Peach bellini on a hot day???? Pablo picasso salad is a must and all the pizzas are cooked to perfection but beware save room for the PIZOOKIE!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! I am typically very forgiving amd patient with wait staff, but this service was beyond bad."}
{"text":"We arrived with high expectations at little after 8 PM on Saturday and the wait was only about 20 minutes. We chose to be seated on the patio which was pleasant. Everything was good, including our red wine, until the food arrived. We both ordered pasta. I can't remember ever having a worse pasta experience, not even close. The pasta was served lukewarm, not hot. It was overcooked, gummy and stuck together. The pasta serving was huge but the sauce serving was way too small for the size of the pasta serving. Half of the pasta was serving was without sauce. We were both surprised and disappointed at the poor food preparation and quality. Obvious serious new restaurant start-up problems."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Oregano's!!! Food is awesome and the service a 5+ always!!! I love  the Vino bambino and big rig pasta with meatballs, yummy"}
{"text":"The best joint in Mesa.  Love their whole menu and the atmosphere.  Can't say anything but awesome about this place"}
{"text":"Really unfortunate incident happened at my favorite  restaurant ever. I love Oreganos. It's an obsession for me so this was really upsetting for me...
I ordered for pick up what I always get, a 12in pan cheese pizza with no stewed tomatoes, along with an appetizer and a cookie. When I got home and had bitten into my pizza, there were stewed tomatoes. Not a huge deal, just a bummer. I had taken a few more bites into my pizza and there was bacon and loads of it on just one section. It was almost as if they had started sprinkling the bacon on their and realized \"oh wait, this is supposed to be a cheese pizza!\" and attempted to pick all of it off but didn't get it all... Now, this wouldn't be a huge deal, if I wasn't a VEGETARIAN. I had swallowed a piece of bacon. I haven't eatin meat in, jeez I'm not sure how long. I was immediately disgusted. I gave the pizza to my brother. Money was waisted and meat was eaten. Just a terrible and eupsetting incident."}
{"text":"Just a friendly reminder don't check in to avoid wait time on this app. The manager said they had other graduation parties that they had to attend to and turned us away basically. So we took our graduation party to an different restaurant that took us right in.....







After speaking with the owner
He made things sooo much better and we had a server that was very professional, food was hot and sooo good which I LOVE!!! Thank you for making things right! I will be returning."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW

We have been back to Oregano's in Cave Creek 3 times since our rather disappointing visit back in March.  All 3 visits have been great.  Please understand, I have never had a problem with the food or service at this Oregano's, the food and service have always been good.  My last review was based solely on the way we were treated when we walked in the door.  

My Wife decided she wanted to go to Oregano's for Mother's Day, so we made a mid afternoon visit and had a wonderful meal.

We were able to get seated right away, and sat in the main dining room.  I have to say that I love this location, and the history of the builiding that Oregano's now occupies.  

Since my Wife and I have really cut back on meat, we normally split an \"Oregano's Favorite\" salad and then each get a \"bollo pasta\" with marinara sauce.  We switched things up this time.  My Wife decided she wanted just the salad for her meal (only after I promised to have some), and I was wanted a thin crust pizza with sausage and pepperoni (I know, but sometimes there is no substitute for Italian sausage and pepperoni).  Junior, as usual, had the meatball sandwich with the house potato chips.

Since my Wife wanted the salad as her entree, all our food came out at once and it was heaven!  I had a small bowl of salad while my pizza cooled, and it was great.  

If you know Oregano's, you know they make great salads.  They are big, fresh, loaded with ingredients, and they somehow manage to put enough dressing on to coat each bite, but not drown the salad.  If you don't know about Oregano's salads, see above.  They are huge, fresh and very good.  We love the honey vinaigrette dressing on this salad, and just ask for no onions.  

My pizza was very good.  I cheated with the Italian sausage and pepperoni, but it was worth the cheat.  The pizza had plenty of both and a good amount of cheese.  It was cooked perfectly, with the edge of the crust just a little brittle and the middle pliable and tasty.  My only negative with Oregano's thin crust pizzas is that they never seem to have enough sauce, so I have learned to ask for extra sauce, and it was perfect.

While junior only ate a small part of his meatball sandwich and chips; he was happy with it, and the rest of it disappeared before he went to bed.  He now prefers the sandwich with the excellent house made potato chips instead of fries.

Note to Management:  Please consider offering these chips as an appetizer.  They are very good!

The best part of our meal was our server, Tamsen.  She was great!!  She introduced herself and said she'd be taking care of us, and did just that.  She made us feel welcome and appreciated.  Our drinks were always topped off, she was patient with our ordering and my questions about the gift card.  She even sent us on our way with drinks for the ride home (nice touch!).  

Great job Oregano's!  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not going to review the food, I've eaten at both the Tempe and Flagstaff locations to know that Oregano's in general is OK that's about it, it's not life changing so that said here's the issue with this new location.

We arrived at 4:03pm, walked up to the hostess stand where clearly written all over the front in a huge sign it stated \"We Open At 4pm\" this is where I have a major issue... the hostess tells me that there is already a 90 minute wait to which I didn't hold back I left out a LOUD \"WTF\" followed by \"You just opened 3 minutes ago and there's barely anyone here! 

The manager who happened to walk up at that exact second tells me that they have been taking names on the wait list since 3pm... now again the issue, if you don't open till 4pm how do you have a list started at 3pm!!! 

This isn't Studio 54 in 1979, or for anyone that can't get that reference, how about a red velvet rope around Radius-Axis Scottsdale which last I checked is still closed .. let's hope that this type of behavior doesn't piss off the residents of Goodyear to the point that they shy away from this place. 

The bad news, I won't be back there for months... many months, the good news, there are 10 other restaurants within 500 feet that I haven't been turned away from 3 minutes after they opened the door."}
{"text":"For being a chain restaurant, I really do love this place.   It's always consistent and taste delicious every time.   Some of our favorites are the Alfredo of the Dark pasta with chicken, the Big Rig with Sausage, the BBQ chicken pizza is outstanding.   And to top it off a pizza cookie for dessert.  What more can I say.  Great food, great prices, great service."}
{"text":"My friends and I came in and had Lexi H as our server. Service was fantastic and good was even better. I unfortunately broke a lamp during dinner and Lexi was very kind and nice and cleaned up the lamp as well. The Pesto Penne is great and Lexi was a great help."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this chicago style pizza, it's too thin, more like new York style. We ordered cookie pizzas to go, each cookie is supposed to have 3 scoops of ice cream, when you get it to go they only give to 1 per cookie..."}
{"text":"Water was good.  But alas after 2hrs waiting for the food what can be said.  We started with a party of 10... then after 1hr we were 8... then 6 after 2hrs.  This was after multiple promises a table would come soon. Recommend you try another place."}
{"text":"Been to several Oregano's locations over the years, first time at this one.  Parking is lousy here with a lot about 1/4 the size it needs to be to accomodate their guests.  The mall parking lot however has lots of space and we took advantage of that.  I generally like Oregano's but the wait at most locations keeps me away.  Maybe it was timing but on a recent Saturday mid-afternoon, 2 of us were seated immediately.  Gasp!

I think this location may seat more than some of their stores.  We were seated at a bartop that seemed right in the middle of traffic.  Asked to move to a booth, no problem there.  Service was friendly and as fast as can reasonably be expected with pizza at Oregano's.

I like their thin-crust pizza and they deliver this as expected.  Don't waste your time w/ the pizookie (or whatever it's called baked cookie) unless you enjoy squishy semi-baked cookie dough (ugh).  Kind of funny that it's always half-baked as they make a big deal about advance-ordering and ask you WHEN you order your entree if you want desert because it takes time to bake.  What?? 

Glad to see Oregano's growing.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I love me some Oreganos. I love their salads, and they are enough for 2 full meals! You might as well ask for half to be boxed up before they bring it out"}
{"text":"What keeps me coming back, you ask? Their salads! They are huge, tasty, fulfilling. Ambiance is nice especially if you can sit outside. I recently had the Italian Wedding Soup which was to DIE for. Their pizza is good, meatballs in any entree Ive had are great. Just everything."}
{"text":"I usually hit one of the Oregano's every time I come to Phoenix. They are always good and always consistent. This time I tried the thin crust pizza instead of the stuffed pizza. I was hoping for a NY style pizza, but it was more of a Midwest style thin crust. The crust was thin and crispy. Not like an Italian wood-fired crispy, but a nice Midwest crispy. The sausage was fresh and not frozen. They used a good cheese and an above average pepperoni. All and all, a very good pizza combined with great customer service."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Decent service. A bit pricey. But the pizza cookie... Oh the pizza cookie. How I love you so. Got the pesto chicken deep dish. Well worth the hour wait."}
{"text":"This was a great place! 10 of us showed up to have a quick lunch and the hostesses/waitresses were more than happy to accomdate us all. We ate out on the patio and enjoyed the sunshine. The orders were a little bit slow coming out, even though half of us just had a salad. The food was very, very good. I had the jr. caesar salad with chicken, and it was BIG- but not half as big as the FULL orders some people got- those have to be the biggest salads I have ever seen. Wow! I didn't hear any complaints from my group. The waitress did a good job dealing with such a large party."}
{"text":"Great service and when a little hiccup in order happened the server and manager went above and beyond to show they're dedication to us as a customer.  We will be frequent visitors here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. My favorite location.  

4 or more distinct seating options, including an honest-to-goodness air conditioned patio.

Big Rig Pasta w/broccoli is excellent."}
{"text":"One of my fondest memories when I was in college took place when I was on a diet for three months.  I had no sweets during that entire time.  So when my friends and I came here for a late night dessert visit, we each got our own pizza cookie.  I had them before, but this visit was heavenly.  The experience was the very definition of foodgasm.

So when I returned to Tempe for the first time since I left in 2007, I knew I had to go back to Oregano's.  Fortunately everything was just as I remembered.  Huge sandwiches including my entree, the veggie wedgie.  It was a little underseasoned but the aioli helped it a lot.  The pizza cookie was just as good as every.  Nice and hot.  Simple concept and yes, I could make it at home, but why when they make it for you."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food 1 Star for the service. The bartender was so rude and loud he did not seem to like his job. The reason I know is because he was complaining about it the whole time while I was trying to enjoy my food. Also the bar seemed very dirty. Very disappointing and unprofessional."}
{"text":"When we walked into Oregano's,  the first thing I noticed was the music. Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Harry James, big band jazz. All music I LOVE, but when we came in it was so loud that we couldn't have a conversation over it. We asked our waiter, Kevin, to have the volume lowered just a bit, and he complied cheerfully. Then I heard Count Basie's \"April in Paris\" and I suspected I was in the right place. With our pizza, the \"Bistro Classic\" we got a salad so big we split it. And the salad only costs six bucks. I ordered a Zinfandel (Seven Deadly Zins, which I had drunk before) from their limited wine list, and Kevin responded, \"Right. White Zinfandel.\" I said, \"No, not white Zinfandel, but regular Zinfandel. It's a red wine. Double check and make sure it's not white Zinfandel.\" He checked and, indeed it was an excellent Zin.  Except for that little hiccup, his service was faultless. He was attentive and the food was brought in a timely fashion. Then came the pizza. It might as well have come floating down from heaven on little angel wings. The crust was angelically thin and crisp. Instead of a tomato base, this pizza features an olive oil-garlic base topped with Wisconsin mozzarella. Over this lies a layer of fresh basil and sliced Roma tomatoes. Ingredients and seasoning were proportioned perfectly. It is one of the best pizzas we have ever tasted. As we were enjoying our meal, I happened to see the story about the owner's father, Lawrence Gibbilini, born in north Chicago in 1918. The manager very graciously printed a copy of the story for me to keep. Gibbilini's family started what may be the first pizza delivery service. Gradually Lawrence took over the cooking responsibilities from his wife. Until his death, he loved to invite friends over to eat pizza and listen to the big band jazz that he adored. When he died, his family found in storage hundreds of disparate pieces of chinaware and silverware that they never knew he was collecting. Apparently he had always dreamed of opening a restaurant that featured the food and the music he loved. Now his son has amply fulfilled his father's dream by offering us this wonderful package: Oregano's, the restaurant, the music, and some of the finest pizza in the world."}
{"text":"Upon browsing Yelp for a restaurant close by I stumbled on Oreganos. I read the most recent review and just had to try it out. Hoping to have the same amazing experience as that reviewer and his son (the birthday boy) even down to asking for the same server. 
Hands down the best experience my family and I have had in a long while. It's a busy place but we only waited 5-7mins for a table. Once you experience how great their food is, you'll  know why it's well worth the wait however long it is. 
On suggestion we started with the garlic cheesy bread,  the Pablo Mexican salad,  18\" thin crust One-O supreme pizza and ending the food coma with a chocolate chip pizza cookie. The food was melt in your mouth good and cooked to perfection.  
Although the bar drinks took way too long (especially when we could see he wasn't busy) our server Cassie was so friendly and pleasant she actually made me forget how long it had even been! Cassie is the reason we wish we could give it 100 stars. She made great food suggestions, connected with not only my wife and I but my kids too. She was extra thoughtful with drinks to go and packing up our food for us  without even asking her, we are TEAM CASSIE all the way! Employees sure can make a place, especially when you have kids. I can tell Cassie loves her job and it's contagious! The entire atmosphere from their  \"Welcome in\" to everyone that walked in the doors down to the manager Pat helping Cassie deliver our food and following through on checking how our meal was before we left. Top notch food & customer service!! Thank you, 
You can bet we will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was good and plentiful. Bellini is a must! Our service there was far greater than Olive Garden across the street, over there all food comes out at the same time, appetizers and all. At Oregano's they space the service of every course. Kuddos!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Clarks street meat pizza...and it was delicious!   And the gold wings are always a fave.  Will order the pizza again, only thing it was a long wait before we could pick up our to go but it is a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Love the salads, the thin crust pizzas, and the pizookie!!! All of the salads and thin crust pizzas are delicious, I cannot recommend one pizza or salad over another. Just go with whatever strikes you at the moment. I'm happy I live right by here so I can go often. I love walking by and smelling all the deliciousness wafting from the restaurant. I like sitting outdoors here. I can't comment on the Chicago style pizza because I personally do not like thick pizzas."}
{"text":"Honestly, I love Oregano's. It's one of the first places I go when I come home. This particular time left a bad taste in my mouth, which is why it's not getting a higher score. For starters, my family and I never received our plates, napkins or silverware. My nephew (who is a child) wasn't given a kids menu. Even after the food came, we still never received our plates and silverware. I literally had to get up, go to the small set up that they have that holds those items and grab everything myself. Our garlic cheese bread never came out, when it did, I had to wait another 10 mins for the marinara sauce that I had ordered with it-which I had to darn near go into the kitchen for bc no server touched our table. We were later informed that they had been running out of bread, which would have been nice to know prior to getting ready to leave. We asked a specific food runner about our food, she never checked on it and made sure she strategically turned away from us when dropping food off in her attempt to avoid us. I'm not picky, so I tried to pay it no mind until I realized EVERY other table got superb service in our section. Plates, silverware, napkins, water/drinks refilled, extra sauces, CHEESE GARLIC BREAD (imagine that), kids with kids menu and even dough to play with. I believe the managers family sat in front of us. After sitting with them and then seeing him check a few tables, it hit me that just maaaaaybe some of this could have been avoided had he just come over and checked on us. I tried to not think it was because we were the only black family in that area. Our server was nice and personable, it just sucks that the experience was so awful and that's not typical of Oregano's. Maybe better luck next time at a different Oregano's."}
{"text":"I've never truly understood the Oregano's allure. It's a chain with the same menu and products in every location. There is always a wait for tables and rarely a seat at the bar. This is good for them but not for me. 

I find their food average at best. The pizza is great, but everything else on the menu is subpar. I ordered the salad yesterday and it was the ass end of a head of romain (you know all the yellow bits no one wants to eat) with a few soggy croutons and cucumbers. I ate less that a ¼ of it. I also got the meatballs that were doused in cheese to make up for their dryness but they weren't fooling anyone. 

Our server was great and they do have a nice patio but with so many great authentic locations in Phoenix I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Love the food, drinks and desserts. Their cookie ice cream is the best. Their employees r super nice and always get treated well."}
{"text":"It is really, really hard not to get totally stuffed when you go to Oregano's. Tonight was my first time trying their stuffed Number One-o, and I'm glad I waited a little bit before trying to have a second slice. Because having a second slice definitely would not have been a good idea. Delicious as it was, and ooey gooey with cheese, it was VERY filling. But did I have room for dessert? Of course I did! And since 8 of us shared 2 pizzookie's (only, really only like 5 of us had some....and of those 5 only 2 had more than one bite (I was one of the two)), I felt totally okay with it. But alas, I left satisfied and very, very happy."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a place that serves a half-baked cookie with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Just sayin. But that's not all we got. We came here for my mom's b-day and it was my husband and 1 year old son too. They were very accommodating for my son who is in a high chair. We had bruschetta, which is great if you like lots of garlic. We also got the pesto ziti, which was kind of lacking in flavor. Needed more basil or salt or something. Also got the spinach salad which was huge and delicious and perfect. The Italiano lasagna could have used more beef for me; it seemed to be too heavily overweighted in cheese. The service was outstanding, and we got a free pizzookie for my mom's birthday. MMMMM."}
{"text":"Never been to Oregano's before tonight. I had the Vino Bambino salad and The Clark Street meat pizza. Both were bomb! Won't give 5 stars b/c the waitress was a little flighty lol but all in all good experience with Oregano's. Waaaaay better than Spinato's as far as I'm concerned"}
{"text":"Always have moved oreganos and the famous Pizza cookie ! However recently things have gone down hill ! We did take out two weeks ago and the salad was 99% lettuce and then a small piece of chicken with a few almonds and cranberries ... 

Gave it another chance today and got the Alfredo of the dark and while eating I noticed it was kind of dry so I asked for more sauce ... It came ... No problem ... Until I saw on the bill they charged me $1 for adding more sauce ! 

Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Recently we had a take-out of Oregano's pasta Basta and Southwestern shrimp Cesar salad. I'm going to have to say this salad in particular was not my favorite. The pasta dish did not fully satisfy only because adding protein to the dish was disappointing. FYI adding meatballs to your dish means ONE meatball to your dish for $3.50. I repeat- just one. 

But, not to be discouraged! Pizza here is always comforting! :)"}
{"text":"Wow can't put into words how amazing the service was!!! Our server Tyler was so charming and efficient I brought by 78 year old grandmother from Chicago to give her a taste of AZ food and Oreganos did not disappoint!! Our server had great recommendations it made our night so special! Thank you Oreganos and Tyler for giving my grandmother and I such a special night!!"}
{"text":"Pizza, salad and pasta was delicious. Went here while on vacation and found it to be a little mom and pops shop. The flavors for the pizza are spot on. Our waiter, she was absolutely wonderful. She was professional and courteous. I will come back when I'm in town again. The kids loved it since the waiter gave them actual dough to mold while we waited."}
{"text":"Had to write an update....

We went here last night, my third visit, and the dish \"Alfredo The Dark\" is just awful.  I ordered it with chicken and the chicken comes shredded and piled on top.  The dish is made with spiral pasta, poblano peppers, of which I could find none, southwestern cheeses, tomatoes and jalapenos (neither of which I had come with the dish) and the whole conglomeration was just awful.  The flavor was just not good, especially with the shredded chicken.  I thought maybe it would be better warmed up for lunch today but I was wrong.  This dish misses the mark and I won't be ordering it again.  

This place still gets 4 stars because their thin crust pizza is to-die-for.  We had sausage, pepperoni and extra cheese and it is one of my favorites around town!"}
{"text":"Dear god I'm fat.

OK. That's not true. In fact, I've lost weight since moving out to this here Valley of the Sun. But that doesn't mean Oregano's doesn't try to suck me into obesity every dang time I'm here. Warning: This review contains lots of yelling, because the food is INSANE.

But first I want to address my one complaint: The bathroom. WHY! Why must there only be one stall?! This place is on a wait circa 5:00 p.m. every night (including week nights), why must I almost pee my pants waiting for the one stall to be vacated?!!? And it's stuffy in there too. Wah.

(Oh yeah, another review talks about this too: WTF is up with the flies in the main room? There's always one buzzing around our table. The place seems clean so...I dunno.)

ONTO THE FOOD.

It's stupid. The portions, how tasty it is, all of it. It's just dumb. Favorites include:

-Deep dish Sproccoli pizza: Are you kidding me?! I could barely finish one piece, and it's not like I didn't want to eat more. I was just STUFFED. The thin crust ain't nothin' to sneeze at, either. And make sure they take the bucket-o-parm and sprinkle it over your pie. YUM.

-Guacatony: Why. Why do they need to over-stuff the large ramekin holding the Italian-herb-laced guacamole so it spills all over the crispy perfection of cheesy-toasty \"chips\"?! WHY?! Because they want me to weigh a deuce, that's why!!!!!

-The veggie sandwich: WHAT WAS THIS MONSTROSITY?! PILES of grilled veggies and cheese (Provolone AND goat cheese, who's counting?), basil, and since I don't dig aioli all that much I ordered a side of marinara to go with it for dipping. I am a sandwich bandit and I could only deal with half of it. 

-Pesto Penne Bake: How is this? And why is this? Pesto pasta and sundried tomatoes and cheese BAKED INTO A BREAD BOWL WHY. 

-Boyfriend's favorite salad on Earth is the Pablo Picasso salad. Also, a \"small\" version of this is roughly the size of a football field. I'm afraid of the regular-sized one. I fear it.

-The lunch \"slice\" (2 big slices) with their awesome house salad (homemade Italian dressing = savior) is a STEAL.

I'm faint just typing this all out. My love of Oregano's truly exhausts me. I think I need to make a trip soon to regain strength."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick lunch. Had the bowl'o pasta, which never fails. Endless pasta for $5.99? I'm quite certain it can't be beaten. The service was quick, I was in and out in under 45 minutes. But most impressively, the staff was exceedingly friendly and attentive. Not only do they take pride in their job but they also clearly enjoy it while putting forth 110%. I have found this to be the case at every Oregano's I have visited. The organization as a whole takes customer service to the next level and it shows. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"I used to work here so my opinion is swayed.  The food here is top quality and good priced. I loved working here and I miss the pizza. I couldn't pick just one good thing there. I really do like it all... serious. 

But If I had to pick:

my fav app is the Guca Tony

fav pasta is the Big Rig, but... the Alfredo is close too

fav pizza..... ugh.. I like them all, all styles....

fav sandwich is meatball

fav salad is the pablo

I could go on but its Saturday night and I need to go out."}
{"text":"Too much cheese... made it a bit hard to eat. Took a 10 and 13 year old who liked the pasta way more than the pizza."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate a birthday and were told the wait would be 25-30 min.  We waited (outside in over 100 degree heat with 4 little kids) for 1 hour 10 min.  Not once did hostess come out to apologize or offer water, etc.  With having little ones with us we would have gone elsewhere in downtown Gilbert if we had known we would have had to wait that long.  When seated we asked to speak to a manager.  Our waitress provided great service and was friendly.  Food was excellent.  But 3 times during our meal server asked if manager had come to speak to us yet, he had not.  Just as we were walking out, and had already paid, manager came over and we told him what happened with the long wait.  He handed me a card for the \"no wait\" app, which we had already used.  Not sure how that was to remedy the situation?  We used that app. It just kept telling us for the 1hr 10min that we were \"about to be seated\".  He \"conveniently\" offered to take something off the bill (but we had already paid, I think he waited til after we paid purposely).  Nothing at all was done to remedy situation"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in cave creek.   Timed it much better this time and had no wait-manager did a great job of checking on the customers"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service! Our favorites are the Classic Bistro pizza and the Big Beefstro Salad. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu though!"}
{"text":"We always have friendly service here, although the pizza seems to take forever to come out. The cheesy garlic bread is amazing, and my kids ask for it ever time. I prefer the thin crust pizza, and the bonus is that way food comes out a little quicker. This most recent visit we tried their sandwiches. My Italian was packed full of meat and was nicely toasted. It was so big, I had enough of for lunch the next day. 

The pizza cookie was good. Unfortunately, this was the second time in a row where they delivered the wrong combination to us. We got chocolate chip and white macadamia nut rather than the chocolate chip and peanut butter we had asked for. Since I was using a free birthday coupon, we chose not to bring it to our server's attention."}
{"text":"I've only ordered to go from this location, but each time the food is ready within 10-15 min from placing the order and it's always fresh and hot! The Alfredo In the Dark is delicious! A hint of jalapeño and cotija cheese make this pasta pop!"}
{"text":"This a cute and fun American Italian food place. The service is outstanding and they take care of you.
I like the thin crust pizza, salads are HUGE, appetizers are nice. The fries and wings are really great too.
Love the bellinis and they are not the traditionally made ones. They are nice and strong and wonderful in the summer, because they are frozen and super cold."}
{"text":"All I want to know is why is the music so dam loud?? I understand the wait time and the 1/2 ass service you get but the music is beyond me. Shoot even in the womens bathroom is ridiculously loud. Turn in down a notch to make it a pleasurable experience, if the wait is as long as it is and the wait staff pretty thin at least let us paying customers enjoy the atmosphere and company"}
{"text":"Been here twice usually just because of a family occasion n sure enough wait is over two hours, unless if your party is six or less then don't waste your time the sitting is limited and once seated the area was a booth with tables but they didn't have enough tables to sit and accommodate all of us, we ended up dinning all close to each other believe it or not they only had six additional chairs to accommodate all of us. I can't make any sense of s restaurant only having six chairs in the entire establishment that supposed to hold over two hundred people wow!!!"}
{"text":"My friends had raved about the deep dish pizza at Oregano's so I had to try it.  I ordered it and had it delivered through PostMates.  It came with paper plates, plastic silverware, napkins, and parmesan cheese and crushed red peppers.  When I opened the box the pizza looked incredible!  However, there was one MAJOR problem....the pizza had not been cut.  In normal situations, it wouldn't be a big deal because I could just use my own pizza cutter.  But, I was helping a friend move into his house, and he didn't know where his pizza cutter was.  So, we had to basically use plastic knives to try to cut pieces and pull it apart.  I would have given 5 stars on the pizza, but sending out a deep dish pizza without cutting into slices is just unacceptable.  ."}
{"text":"This place is very terrible and expensive . The food is so  bad . I went there with my fiancé and his daughter last Sunday . My fiancé 's daughter order the Cesar salad no meat they charge 6 dollars , after she ate her stomach hurt !!! When we ate pizza from there me and my fiancé we both go home and have a upset stomach . My fiancé go bathroom many time . I called the manager of restaurant complaint for refund money . But the lady manager still Irnoge . She is very bad customer service . I tell everyone that don't come there . Because the food no fresh and so expensive and make you sick !!!  We always eat from Wendy for salad and chili soup so delicious and cheap and fresh they make fresh every day just 11 dollars for Salad Apple chicken and 2 chili soup !!
If we compare the bill at Oregano pizza they charge too much . 62.18 , I suggest the people should to come Wendy just $11 for 2 person very good food and fresh every single day !!!"}
{"text":"we went for lunch pretty big work crowd with us. the food was good, but the jazz music was blaring and we asked 3 different times for them to turn it down so we could talk but they didn't. so we had to pass messages around the table which was pretty inconvenient. I wouldnt recommend if you want to talk with each other but if you want to bring someone you don't really want to talk to and just eat then go for it."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to go they have two indoor restaurants and an outside patio which separates each restaurant.  I ordered the lunch special of two slices of pizza for $3.00 expecting to receive Chicago style thick crust pizza instead I received thin crust NY style pizza.  The Italian wedding soup is also really good and the staff are very friendly.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"The best pizza in town.  Get there early for supper as there is always a wait.  Be sure to try one of the locations as its amazing!"}
{"text":"Hate to leave negative reviews....

Buyer beware. If you order a deep dish and they get it wrong. Guess what? Ding ding ding. You got it. You are outta luck. You can wait another 45 mins or so waiting for your pizza to be remade while you eat a comped appetizer or salad... Mistakes for this establishment are very unforgiving. 

I appreciate they tried to make it right. But. After all that waiting... The pizza itself was petty disappointing and very much MEH. Can't say the pizza is good at all. So sad... 

Save your time and money. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is really good, although expect a long wait on the weekends, but it's well worth it. It's also right next to a movie theater"}
{"text":"Oregans is wasn't that good. Went to dinner after looking at Christmas lights. They forgot our order of cheesey bread. We reminded us and then it came out.then the pizza and pasta came out. There was plastic in my pasta. Not coming back."}
{"text":"It's was good. I got 2 of the slices and 1 corkscrew kids pasta bowl. Went here for lunch. It was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Oreganos wasn't to good this time. Pizza was burnt and the top layer of crust in deep dish you couldn't even taste. I got the bowl of pasta and the bresalsprauts. The service was fantastic though."}
{"text":"Perfect, affordable, crowd pleasing italian-American food. It totally wins. You can't go wrong at Oregano's."}
{"text":"Pretty upset with the service we received the other day around 3pm at this specific Oregano's.(We go to different Oregano's often.) We walked in and sat at the bar, waited 5MIN just for the bar tender to say \"you guys want to go and sit at a table?\" We were both confused but went and sat at a table in the other room from the bar. We thought maybe she was behind on work, so We waited about 10 more MIN for our new server to ask what we would like to drink, waited another 15MIN for our drinks and at this point we were ready to order. My boyfriend got \"The Big Rig\" pasta and I got a slice of cheese pizza. The waitress finally brought out my bfs pasta after 30MIN, she didn't offer any fresh Parmesan cheese for his pasta, and just told me she will be right back with my slice of pizza and walked away. We sat there for another 25MIN!! My bf was pretty much finished with his pasta (which he said was great) but we had no idea where our waitress was. My bf looked around the room and saw her taking a order for a 15 top-table.. I didn't receive my pizza for another 15MIN. She finally brought my slice of cheese pizza to the table but my bf was finished with his pasta and we were both ready to leave at this point. I advised our waitress in a polite way that I no longer wanted the slice of cheese pizza and that I had waited over an hour for that slice. She grunted, walked away, didn't care to apologize for the 1 hour wait for a slice of pizza, didn't even care to try to accommodate and leave the slice and say \"it's on the house\" or anything apologetic and just brought us the check. We then paid with cash, she didn't bring us our change for another 20MIN, we were unsure if she knew how to count money. This was the worst service I've ever had. My boyfriend and I agreed to never go to this Oregano's again."}
{"text":"Great food & a place for family.  Think in advance, they don't take reservesd.  Calling in advance, clearly doesn't meet what they indicate.  If you have time to kill try them, the food in great, especially their salads."}
{"text":"Love the Pablo Picasso, and Alfredo the Dark, staff is always friendly, food is awesome. Highly recommend this place for a casual family pizza and Italian food. Beware portions are huge!"}
{"text":"This place is great....just great.  Been going there for years.  You can get pretty good quality pizza......east like a pig.....for about $15...and that includes salad and drink with tons of pizza."}
{"text":"Yesterday:
Beneil was a conscientious bartender but was way too preoccupied with stocking. He was unpacking boxes NONSTOP. And it was happy hour, on a Monday but still. There were 8 people at the bar. Get that $ hit done by 3!  We ordered boom dip, delish; guac-atony, also delish; broccoli, perfect and Brussels Sprouts (BS), EPIC FAIL. I suspected by the color that they were underdone. The first bite confirmed it. Because Berneil was sweating (literally, uh, gross) the task of stocking I had to flag a runner to send them back. She was cool. A manager-looking dude came out. He acknowledged they were hard and said they would boil them longer. Because we finished the rest of our food and they were still absent I interrupted the stocker/bartender to request they put the BS right in a to go box. Guess what I'm eating right now, (which reminded me to Yelp this)?  You guessed it, The BS! And they are twins to first order. This is TMJ discomfort. Epic fail Oreganos. Let your bartenders bartend and stop effing up the BS. On a happy note, the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday and I'm never going back.  I got there at around 4 45 pm and even though we were once of the only people in our section at the time of arrival we were the last to get our food after several other parties had sat down and ordered.  Mind you we only ordered one salad and one pizza. The salad was good but the pizza took incredibly long to get finished. Our server didn't seem very attentive and rarely stopped by to see if we needed a refill or to even say anything about how soon our food would be ready. Finally got refills only to come back with a dead fly in my cup. The pizza finally came and practically fell apart in a saucy mess the moment you touched it. The kitchen barely made an effort to cut the crust which was extremely hard and kinda burnt. Overall this place was just a let down. Several people had recommended it to me and hyped it up. I guess if you want to wait forever for your food, have dead bugs in your drink and get treated like a 2nd class citizen than this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I was so happy when I heard Oreganos was being built in Cave Creek earlier this year!  Glad we waited a few weeks/month since the opening. Just couldn't  do an over an hour wait..especially in Cave Creek. Only a 15 minute wait on a Thursday nite. That was fine because I headed back to bar for some vino for bday boy and a Bellini for myself. I always get a Bellini ( okay two) at Oreganos! Ashley our server was amazing. Great energy and so sweet! On our menu: Garlic cheese bread w marinara to start. Try it! Kiddo got pizza, man did some spicy pasta dish that normally comes w shrimp but can sub chicken. I tried chicken lasagna and was super happy. ( Not happy when someone ate my leftovers next day) Boo! Ashley even packaged up a comped pizza cookie to go for the bday boy. Will be back soon very soon! Welcome to Cave Creek and keep up the good work guys :)"}
{"text":"No one, I mean NO ONE does the thin crust pizza better that Oregano's. 'Tis a real shame this place is no where near my home on So Cal. Their sauce is the perfect amount of salty sweetness and the cheese blend they use is superb. I wouldn't mess around with those specialty pizzas they have on the menus because their classic traditional pizzas are top notch. Please come to So Cal, please ..."}
{"text":"It was good. 
Will go back cause it was good.
They even doubled up on my onions and peppers in my pasta, yey."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst service that I have encountered at a restaurant, and was very disappointed in the fact that we were there for almost 3 hours. I ordered a deep dish pizza and understood the 45min it took to cook this dish, what I did not understand was how it was sitting on top of the food countered and it took 15min for it to reach our table. I also was not too thrilled with the pizza cookie at the end, but was given that for free so not a huge deal there. I am hoping that if I go there again it will a little better on the service side."}
{"text":"Food is great. Quoted a 20 min wait, sat down at 40 min. Placed our order right away but didn't see any food for another hour. 1:45 is insane to get food in front of a 4-top. Staff was friendly thoughout, it seemed like insane waits are the norm."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service, just passing through and was craving Italian! My parents are moving here will definitely be a place we come to on a regular basis and will tell parents! Thank you for your kindness!"}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza for takeout so I can't really comment on the dining experience. But I can safely say the pizza itself is fantastic. This pizza tasted so fresh and full of flavor. The cheese was great quality (real Wisconsin cheese), the sauce had a good level of different flavors, and the chicken was good as well. The crust was thin but crispy and fresh.

Overall, a great pizza with a lot of flavor. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Pizookie pizookie pizookie!! Pizza is awesome and the staff is awesome love coming here for dinner!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool!  I was traveling to visit a client and they picked this place for lunch.  I quickly understood why!  Very cool atmosphere, great service.  The food is ridiculous!  Classic Chicago style pizza.  The stuffed pizza looked absolutely legit  and my client was sold with the authenticity.  I got the lunch special slice.  They actually give you two slices and it was delicious.  Very fresh ingredients and they stick with that.  No need to fancy it up.  Took a cool pic of the decor, an homage to The Godfather.  Great food, service and atmosphere.  Definitely will be back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"We've been frequent lunch patrons to the Oregano's at Dobson & Southern and pretty well know what to expect.  The visit today was well below par.  

My friend and I both ordered the all you can eat pasta bowl with meat sauce.  Of course the plate come with a pile of spaghetti and a minimal 4 oz of meat sauce.  Enough to make you want some.  We both immediately order more meat sauce fully aware we're getting tagged for another $2 for the privilidge.  Lunch is almost half over when the waitress asks how everything is and we again ask for the freaking meat sauce.  

When finally she brings the sauce one was marina.  My friend took the meat sauce, and rather than eat plane noodles I dumped the marinara on my plate.  

When later I let the waitress 'Samantha' know about the mistake, rather than apologize she gave me a syrupy \"are you sure?\"  I told her I wasn't interested in an argument.  

When the bill came of course I had been charged for the meat sauce.  I paid the bill, left no tip and will not return to this Oregano's again.  

I have had positive experiences on every prior visit and and at other Oregano's especially on Elliot Rd, on University, and in downtown Gilbert.  

I don't know if 'Samantha' was expressing herself with her poor service or management; from my perspective it doesn't matter.  Our dining experience was spoiled over 4 ounces of meat sauce we had to order twice, never received, yet paid for rather than debate the matter further."}
{"text":"Oreganos is the most friendly restaurants out in Arizona! Everyone is full of smiles and on top of that amazing food! The pizza cookie and the boom dip would have to be my top favorite! I would definitely recommend Oreganos for anyone!!"}
{"text":"Under staffed and under trained staff. Not your typical Oreganos experience. Staff is rough. 
A chaotic dining experience at best. An espoused Chicago restaurant and no Blackhawks game only Ozzie and Harriet come on now.....Cave Creek is starving for any dining experience ...Time will tell...."}
{"text":"Had the bruschetta for an appetizer and the big run pasta and thin crust pizza for entees.  Both were great!!  The service was excellent.  The pizza takes a little while but is worth the wait."}
{"text":"We stopped here because we were starving and I had a wicked headache. The environment was loud and festive, but it was definitely fun. The cheese pizza we got was well seasoned and thin. The service was super friendly, and I recommend this place as a pizza-lover."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food at a reasonable price. Very casual dining. Pizza, pasta, sandwiches are delicious."}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:05 and there was a line waiting to be seated.  Not sure why they don't seat people since there were tables on the patio open and once we were seated inside there were at least 6 empty booths and tables.  When we walked inside there was a really unpleasant fish smell but it seemed to subside.  Service a little spotty and it took a while for the food to arrive. We always get the Anti pasta salad and a pizza.  The salad was really good and the pizza tasty though it was slightly soggy in the middle pieces. Our server asked us if we wanted desert when she brought us the pizza which seemed liked she wanted us to eat and get out.  Overall it was okay and I would probably go back but I would not wait in any line to get in.  There are too many other choices out there to pay for an ok experience."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale visiting and came in because people said it was really good. I'm pretty picky about Italian food and this place did not live up to the hype when it came to the food. Service was great but I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and the eggplant was tough and the noodles were overcooked. Maybe the other dishes are better but not sure if I would come back."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday afternoon about 3:30, 5 tables with guests in the whole place ordered a beef sandwich, waited, waited and waited, finally tracked down a waiter at 4:15 and asked him to get our waiter to find out where our food was no one resurfaced so we walked out!!!! Won't be going back, what a shame how the tide has turned!! If you could get the employees to put their cell phones away maybe work would get done!! The table next to us never got their food either and they were before us and only ordered a salad and sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Oregano's doesn't thrill me, but I keep going back since it's the only reasonably priced option for pasta in this area.

The service is always good, even when the restaurant and bar are packed. I've even had a server quickly turn an eat-in order into a takeout order (due to an emergency call) without blinking an eye. The wait can be quite long no matter the hour or location, so go completely outside of meal hours or expect to stand around in a parking lot.

The food isn't that great. The thin crust pizza is typically overcooked. The baked pasta is just so-so and too generously portioned, always baked with too much cheese. The marinara sauce is overly seasoned, perhaps in homage to their consistently over-the-top style. I do like their meatballs, which unfortunately are bigger than a child's fist. The meatball sandwich suffers from too much cheese (none would be a good amount), but tastes good.

I think my general malaise regarding Oreganos has to do with their menu. It is ridiculously large both in terms of size and options, most of which do not appeal to me. Everything seems too big, too complicated, too daunting, too smothered. If I had to build my preferred meal, it would be a half of a junior sized Mediterranean salad, one meatball, and a side of sweet potato fries. Knowing that I'll probably go back, I'll try to order it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight. Asked for the take out order to be ready at 4:45. Got there 10 minutes early and it was already in the warming box so cold by the we got home. Worse - the Brussels sprouts we're burnt on one side, under cooked on the other. Pizza burnt at the edges.

My wife wanted to give a five. We had take out. Excellent thin crust pizza with good pepperoni. Good wings, although not as large as they used to be and 11 in an order.
The boom shroom pasta was very good. Side of sausage was great.
Oddly, one of the best things was the side of brussel sprouts. Cooked perfectly with a great flavor.
On a Monday at lunch not too busy. The staff helped me get my order out to the car."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good Italian restaurant and definitely found one here. Ordered the stuffed rigatoni with their chipotle cream sauce. Sooooo good!!! Also ordered a salad and love their ranch dressing. The ambiance is really fun and lively. Reasonably priced and courteous, friendly staff. Would HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! This is one of my favorite restaurants! I've tried multiple things on the menu and have never been disappointed. My personal favorite is Alfredo the Dark and also the boom dip for an appetizer is phenomenal! I also have great customer service when I visit and definitely save room for dessert!!!"}
{"text":"Always, always, always love this place. Quality ingredients, great prices, and spice! Usually order the El Diablo Shrimp Pasta because I love the spicy sauce and the shrimp are bigger and tastier, not like chains... and The Big Beef Sandwich - THE BEST. Finally tried the Guaca-Tony YUM!  My favorite casual dining restaurant in the valley because of the combination of quality and value. Simply the best. Thank you Oregano's!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Horrible! Where do I begin. How about one of the first places you will start the drink menu...the Margarita on the menu states top shelf liquor, HAHA you fool should be next to it. We order the Margrita with top shelf liquor after 5 mins waitress comes back and says were out of  well tequila the top shelf will be 2 dollars more so we tell her your menu says top shelf not well, she said oh well we use well, even though it says top shelf ((yet they still charge you top shelf)) then this scary bartender man comes and puts both hands on our table and says top shelf is 2 dollars more, we said to him then why does your menu state top shelf if you really lie and give us well. He didn't say anything and creepy stared at us. Bottom line we walked out will not support a business that lies and trains the staff to lie and not care either."}
{"text":"The absolute best brussel sprouts I've ever had. Absolutely amazing pizza, sides, salads, and drinks. Awesome atmosphere, mainly outdoor seating and I feel like I'm back in Chicago. I would've given it 5 stars if I didn't experience a long wait one of the days, but considering the day (Friday) and time (evening) and weather (gorgeous), it was bound to be very busy. But unfortunately the wait for a table was an hour, and then the pizza was another hour and a half. Luckily I was in good company otherwise i wouldve left, but I'm glad i stayed and got to enjoy their food. I regularly order their brussel sprouts now."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly delicious.  Their pizza was so flavorful and cooked well.  Their homemade vinaigrette on their salads is awesome.  Service was good.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We did a carryout here last night and it was awful. I have no idea what everyone is raving about. Obviously they've never had good  pizza. We got the cheese, sausage and mushroom pizza. First off, there was only cheese and sausage.....no mushrooms. I also ordered the cheese garlic bread, which has to be the worst I've ever had . The bread was definitelly stale and they put mozarella and an orange cheese that I think was cheddar. I've never had cheese garlic bread with anything but mozzarella and a butter garlic spread under the cheese. I would definitely not recommend this place. FWIW -The best pizza I've had is at Pizziarea Bianco. It's a bit of a drive from Scottsdale but worth it. Vino's in Scottsdale is pretty good too."}
{"text":"As a relatively new resident of the valley, I'm disappointed that it has taken me several months to patronize this establishment.  Last night, we left our first visit to Oreganos both satisfied and in great anticipation of our return.  

The atmosphere is very friendly and laid back.  The décor is reminiscent of a hometown pizza joint from the '50's.  Outdoors is a large patio with a bar.  The entire staff makes you feel at home, with the hostesses calling your name as a friend would, not as someone waiting in line at the butcher.  The wait staff is equally friendly and attentive with excellent recommendations.  

Our service was matched in satisfaction by our food.  We started with the Guaca Tony, a delicious pairing of garlic pizza crust chips and Italian guacamole.  For dinner, we split the Big Rig Pasta, agreeably, a favorite of our server.  Our meal was washed away with a pitcher of Dos Equis, leaving us no room for one of Oreganos' popular cookies for dessert.   However, I would welcome a better beer selection for such a unique destination.

This is a place that would be great to bring your family or a large group of friends.  We'll definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"I'm hoping that this is the correct tempe location. Came here for dinner on a Wednesday evening and was served by a waitress named raya, her service was exceptional, she paid just the right amount of attention to us and was really sweet! Food was great (ordered the Caesar salad and a pepperoni pizza), plentiful, and well-priced. Will definitely be back the next time that I visit Arizona."}
{"text":"People love this restaurant--I'm not sure why.  I went to two different locations during my visit to the Phoenix area.  The first visit I had the salad with the shaved jalapeño seasoned beef.  Beef was good, but after a while, a lump of beef on top of nothing but lettuce became boring and not such a wonderful meal.

My second visit I decided to get one of the thin crust vegetarian pizzas--again, nothing to shout about.  The people I was with ordered pasta dishes--a ton of food!  Maybe that is why people love this place?  I didn't dare ask \"why?\", but decided it wasn't on the top of my list for favorites."}
{"text":"Bistro Classic pizza, followed by a pizzookie (ahem.. pizza cookie).   The food is great (It's not down town chicago, but so what?) but the service is UNBELIEVABLY GOOD.  I've been to the other locations and it seems I've had the best service here.  They were SO nice to my 5 year old, and that always goes a long way for a parent who's afraid his child will get bored and turn into a three headed dragon at that table.  I's a comming back that is a fact!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit to this location, the first after they just opened. 

We came in around 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon, not too busy as we were sat in less than 10 min. My wife and I decided to get the stuffed deep dish pizza, we always enjoy their thin crust so we thought this should be good. As we were ordering the waitress told us the deep dish can take up to 45 mins to bake, since we weren't sure we wanted to wait that long, we told her to make it a thin crust. She then told us it would be 30 mins for a thin crust!? So we decided for an extra 15 mins we would stay with the deep dish.

Over an hour later the pizza was finally delivered to our table and we were both starving. After a couple of bites, we both looked at each other and remarked how hard and thick the crust was! I was nearly impossible to cut it with a knife! Not only hard but absolutely no flavor to it. We ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good. We both did not want any more! When our waitress came back, she said that the manager wanted to buy us dessert for our wait but we literally lost our appetite from the pizza. We may go back again but never will order that pizza again, yuck!"}
{"text":"So, I was dining at Oregano's with a couple of love birds and finally I got fed up with the pda's. Before I could stop myself I climbed on top of the table and drenched them with my ice water. \"Can I enjoy my dinner please? Either cool it, or get a room. I came to review the food, not your french kissing.\"

I came back to reality just as appetizers arrived. I would never do that or say that to friends...or would I?  

Anyway, just like Donald Trump, Oregano's does everything real BIG so we honestly didn't need to order all this food, but none of us counts calories. That's so 90's.

Here are my thoughts:  Four stars for the overly friendly staff and thin crust pizza. 

pizza
Not a fan of pan pizza or stuffed pizza. Oregano's really does 'em up, but looks aren't everything. I choose thin crust every time. Yummy.  Simple. Easy to eat. The thicker pies turn into cheesy messes and turn me off.  I get reminded of strings of spittle when the cheese pulls apart. I realize how this can be a turn on for some 
food whores, but not me.  
 
bruschetta 
Please tell me what the big deal is. Anyone? It's bread, with stuff on top - but it's not pizza. If that's your thing, fine, but why do you think you fancy, huh? Oregano's bruschetta just looked sloppy. Big and sloppy. It literally looked like a mound of tomatoes with cheese and basil and some bread sticking out.

guaca-tony
How do you say delicious, d-lovely, D-lectable, d-vine? How do you say D-gorgeous? D-lite? Guacamole was seasoned with basil, garlic, onions, and tomatoes. It was good, but I wish folks would stop putting tomatoes in guac.  The flavor gets watered down. What helped kick up the mildness were the accompanied cheesy salty pizza pie crust dipping slices. Good combination.

yam fries/sweet po's
Yum yum piggy! Comes with aioli and sweet seasoning sprinkled on - which I could totally do without. Leave the natural sweetest alone. 

salad 
On a good day, crispy romaine lettuce is usually a sign of a good salad. But my first bite of Oregano's salad left me with the taste of bag/packaging in my mouth. It wasn't overpowering enough to stop eating, but a disappointment is just that. I regretted not requesting spinach in place of romaine.

BEGIN SIDE NOTE
Best salad at Oregano's: the delicious spinach salad with red onions, marinated portobello shrooms, roasted red bell pepper, and avocado dressing. But that's just a memory now. This salad was removed from the menu. Whose dumb 
idea was that?
END SIDE NOTE

Veggie Wedgie sandwich.  
Skip it. The foccacia bread is way too thick to even enjoy the flavor of the eggplant, portobellos, spinach, and tomatoes. It's served with red pepper aioli and for some reason I had the idea in my brain this should be spicy. It was not and fell flat.

scampi
The love birdies thought the scampi was delicious. I can only give their opinions because I won't eat pasta, or paste noodles as I call them. Lady is a Scampi is shrimp with corkscrew pasta in chipotle sauce, tomatoes, cilantro, cheese, and garlic. The spicier version called El Diablo Shrimp Pasta is in chipotle cream sauce with fettuccine, cheese, and pico de gallo.

pizza cookie
The only dessert they serve. It's warm and topped with ice cream, but way sweet and a little raw. If that's how you go down on your cookies, go 'head playa! (Not playa as in the beach, playa as in play-er.)"}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza is not bad.  The cheese is flavorful.   Now for the Pizza Cookie!  Our waiter TJ was excellent! 

OMG!  That Pizza Cookie was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place was very small, a lot of clutter and and too hectic. I felt uneasy and was unable to relax and enjoy my food"}
{"text":"I got there at 5:30, did not have food in my mouth until 7pm! It's absolutely the longest I have ever waited for food  The pizza was lackluster and I ordered a margarita with pepperoni and they forgot to put my pepperoni so I told them and got a cup of pepperoni for me to put on top  and still charged me for it....really?! I was so so disappointed with this experience. To top it off I got sat on the cold patio with a baby ( I told them two adults and a baby) and there's no heat lamps, not cool. Probably not going here again, which is sad because it's so close to my house."}
{"text":"Family favorite! We have never had an issue with service or food. Great food, but long waits. Get there when they open at 11 or go late afternoon around 3."}
{"text":"I don't get it. When people here that I am from Chicago they ALL recommend Oregano's.  My husband works near the Shea location and brought a pizza home. The crust was super thin which I like, but it lacked pizzazz. I like deep dish, pan, thin crust, super thin, etc, but I did not like Oregano's. Also, they are more on the expensive side."}
{"text":"I been here a few times and the service is always awesome. The food is always delicious. I talk about Oregano's all the time. One of my top places to dine in. I love the atmosphere they have going on. Keep up the awesome job!!"}
{"text":"Great food and the service is amazing! Go here for lunch and you will never have to worry about getting back to work late. Fast prompt and friendly!"}
{"text":"You can definitely tell by other Oregano's reviews I am a huge fan of their food!!! 

But tonight's experience was simply AMAZING!!! the food was awesome, but the service was TOP NOTCH!!

One of the people in our party has a dairy allergy, I know I know we went to an Italian restaurant cheese cheese cheese, but our waitress Gina knew the answer to our allergy questions, everything from the bread to the sauces, she even pointed our an item we had ordered that had dairy mixed into it and got us a different dressing!!!!

Gina you made this one of the most enjoyable outings I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"No place is so special that the hostess should assume I'm going to put my name on their waiting list without first learning what the wait time is.  Miss Scottsdale Hostess didn't even look up or greet us - just a, \"Name?\".  And no restaurant is so special that I should be expected to stand around in the darkest and most run down parking lot in Scottsdale with nothing for my family to do or look at for 30 minutes.  Good places do have a wait - that's a given - but very good places have a more customer-oriented approach to their waits.  There are plenty of other very good places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The Italian food here is terrific! My children and I like to frequent this place for lunch with my husband. We've never had a problem with the wait time."}
{"text":"Always great food and service!   I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Chicago style chow.  The only downside of my visits here are the never ending wait list to be seated and the limited beer selection.  The wait can be avoided if you belly-up to the bar area when a seat opens.  However, the beer selection... it is what it is.  There are plenty of other places nearby if you're looking for a good brew."}
{"text":"Oregano's might be the place for you if (1) you enjoy waiting for a table, (2) you need a bucket of Coke while you wait for a table, (3) you want to consummate your bromance with you bff, (4) you like drinking a bucket of coke with your meal, or (5) you need a bucket of coke to go.  If you are a kid, you might like Oregano's if you like to play with your food.  Instead of a toy, kids get some dough upon request.  They'll even bake it for you.  The wait staff is overly friendly.  I once received a high five for my order selection.  Unfortunately, I was a little confused about receiving a high five for placing my order and left the waitress hanging for a few seconds.  If you can't tell, I really like this place, and it is a stand by in the lunch rotation when we leave for lunch by 11:15 AM.  If it is 11:30 AM, forget about it."}
{"text":"Usually don't have an issue at this location. On Monday at 6 pm, was told the wait would be 30-45 minutes for our party of 8. 1 hour later they tell us that they are waiting for a party to leave. Meanwhile smaller parties that arrived at the same time finished their meal and left. After 1 hour and 25 minutes they said there were still no tables available. Went across the street to another restaurant and was seated immediately. Not sure what the issue was to why they could not accommodate our larger party. Disappointing as we usually have a good experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this new oreganos with my family who had never tried oreganos before. We went to dinner Sunday night. Overall experience was so great! We were seated immediately and service was quick throughout the entire meal. Our server Michael was attentive and very genuine. He was so patient with all the questions we asked about the menu. My dad loved the huge portions and how fresh everything was! We were happy to see the manger Shawn checking in with customers at tables. This is my family's new favorite restaurant! Will definitely return soon"}
{"text":"I'm not usually big on chains but this was really great pizza.  We had the thin crust Numero One-O and it was great.  The sausage and peperoni were really good and so were the veggies and more importantly it was the correct amount of topping.

We also had a cesar salad, it was huge!  The server warned us that a junior salad was more than enough to split and she was right.

Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Organo's for a while now, as I love a good pizza.  My friend and I hit this place on a Sunday afternoon, hoping to grab a good bite to eat.

Upon entering, I liked how the location was set up.  We were told there would be a wait for a table inside, or we could sit immediately outside or at the bar.  We really wanted a table, so we waited in the lobby area.  About 10 minutes later, we were escorted to a nice booth.

We reviewed the menu, which had a huge selection of not only pizza, but pastas and subs as well.  Quite an impressive selection.  We couldn't decide on a pizza to split, so we each got our own dish.  My friend got the Ravioli, and I got a steak n cheese sub.  The portions were huge!  Plus, there was not a tremendous wait for it either.

Anyways, I really liked this place, and would return to eat thier food again."}
{"text":"Went to the Or-eh-gahno land on Tuesday with my bud Goose for a somewhat quick dinner. In general, this location is always poppin' and you wait at least twenty minutes, since it is literally the only Oregano's in the West Valley. People complaining that other locations can deal with being the only one in its \"part of town\"...I don't think you fully understand what being the only one in the West Valley actually means. So...I mean...hey, is it sucky to potentially wait at least an hour for dinner? Sure. But in that hour, you could have stopped complaining and driven over to fave location in, well, every other part of the Phoenix metro area. 

So, back to my night, we only had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table, which was plenty of time to build up our hunger pangs so we could truly appreciate dat pasta. Our server was very attentive and took out drink order almost immediately after we were seated. He took our order and repeated it back for accuracy, which is always comforting. I've had this guy as a server before and he is always a blasty blast. I wish I could remember his name. He's got a beard and a pretty cool way of feelin' the room to see if it's cool to make fun of you in a \"Hey man we're buds now\" kind of way that very few servers can successfully accomplish. 

Food came out pretty quickly. We got some garlic bread with marinara which is literally half a loaf of french bread all buttery and garlicky in the best way. Usually I am all about that Julius Caesar Salad Jr with chicken vibe but today I was feeling like some pasta. My bud got the Penne Pesto Bake, which she dug. I got the Alfredo the Dark with chicken. For some reason, my dish seemed to be a bit oilier than usual, the way reheated Alfredo tends to be, which was kind of a bummer.

Obvi we had to get a pizza cookie. My only complaint is that I wish they wouldn't top the ice cream with mini chocolate chips bc they freeze up and are pretty much the worst to chew.

Beardy McBeard was cool about splitting the check and boxing up our food. Not a bad visit at all. I think that the reason this location gets somewhat negative reviews as a result of their size (yes somewhat small for such a popular restaurant) and the wait time (all Oregano's restaurants seem to have a pretty long wait). I've never had bad service here."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it didn't really start off impressing me. I got here around noon and was sealed immediately on the porch area. Our waiter came around pretty quickly and took our drink order. Since this was our first time trying this place out, we needed a few minutes to look over the menu. 

I decided on the Zany Ziti which is ziti in a bread bowl. The pasta was delicious, however I wouldn't suggest trying to eat the bread bowl as it was really hard, dry, and had no taste to it so I ended up not eating any of it. The Zany Ziti came with a slice of garlic bread which was soft and seasoned well. 

My reason for giving this place a 3 star is because of the long wait from when we were seated to when our food came out. We got here right before the big rush came and we still waited 45 minutes for our food. Was about to ask where it was when they finally brought it out. Large groups that came after I did got their food way before my food, so obviously food wasn't brought out in the order that they were placed. 

Our waiter was very pleasant and very knowledgeable of the menu. He came around often to check up on us, to refill drinks, make sure food was how we liked it, etc. When it came to pay, he was quick to bring our check and cash us out. 

Will come back again, but probably try and come during the week so not to get caught up in the weekend rush."}
{"text":"This place was the worst Oreganos I have ever been to! I went there today at 2:18PM with my family to celebrate my sons 11th birthday and they didn't even acknowledge me or my family for 10 minutes. There was an older Caucasian lady that came after us and she was imediately taken care of, which made us feel discriminated for being a minority.

We decided to leave and call to complain to a manager. After waiting a total of 10 minutes and calling twice, finally a manager named John answered the phone. I told him what happened and he apologized about the service that they provided. 

We ended up going to the Barrio Queen that was down the street and we were seated right away and our server and food was amazing.

They are once more the worst Oreganos I ever been and I will never go there ever again. So disappointed to have been treated that way."}
{"text":"Had a great meal! Came to eat with my family and we loved the food, service and theme"}
{"text":"This place is a chain and I came here from Tucson for a professional event. The back room was nice and it was great there is a screen for presentations. The food was generic/ok, but it really was a great meeting space."}
{"text":"I love this place, as most people do. Those that complain about the length of time to receive their pizzas must not realize that these freshly made pizzas, and ESPECIALLY the pan pizzas, take time. If you are in a hurry, Oregano's may not be the place for you. They are often on a wait, and it can be a lengthy one, use Yelp's \"call-ahead\" or waitlist feature if its available, and plan to wait. I have warned you... places like this are meant to be the main event of the night, not a starter.

Recommendations from my wife and I: 

The thin crust pizzas - great flavor, and perfect proportion of cheese to topping, solid choice and big enough to share with someone else. 

Alfredo the Dark - This stuff is one of my favorites, don't get it confused with a \"Chicken Alfredo\" of the norm... the sauce is lighter and there are some spices and tomatoes that give it a little kick. We add the chicken, but I would be willing to bet the sausage option would be really tasty too! There's enough for two on this plate, the wife and I normally share this and a salad or pizza.

The cookie pizzas - Just the right amount of gooey and sweet... I clean the skillet as good as anyone!"}
{"text":"We love Oreganos!!! 

This location seems to be a hit for our group lunches and dinners. They do a pretty good job of getting us sat and taking care of us. 

Always a great meal at any of the Oregano's locations! Definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Arizona (not that I've been to a whole lot of em).  Their thin crust pizzas are great (delicious toppings and large portions) and their chicken wings - out of this world.  After you stuff yourself, top yourself off with a pizza cookie dessert - it's a half baked cookie with three heaping scoops of vanilla ice cream on top.  I gain 5 lbs. just thinking about it.  On top of all that - their wait staff are friendly, responsive, and very easy on the eyes, ha ha.  Overall, a fun place that is worth a visit when you're in Arizona."}
{"text":"great food period

Lasagna is The BOMB
The Thin Crust Pizza is \"To Die For\"
The Chicken Wings are awesome."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second try because i figured maybe we got all the wrong stuff the first time. Also because my friends are always raving about this place. So we went back to try the deep dish and waited over 45 minutes for a table (what a waste) and after ordering and praying it was gonna be as amazing as everyone says it is, it was....

DUSGUSTING!! I barely finished one slice. This place is SO OVERRATED. I think food out of a garbage  just might taste better. All I know is if I had the option to eat at this place or the gargage, garbage would be my solid number one choice."}
{"text":"The food is what you can expect from any Oreganos but the customer service here is not up to par. It's kinda sad because I went to college in Flagstaff and have set the standard of every location to meet the FLG one."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite restaurant! I have eaten at more restaurants, fast food and fast-casual establishments than I care to remember and Oregano's is the best! 

I first started eating at their Tempe location about 16 or 17 years ago and have probably eaten at the Tempe location (as well as Mesa and Gilbert) at least 100 times over the years. 

My favorite dish was the \"Pasta Basta\" with shredded chicken added. The lunch time personal stuffed pizzas, heck-of-a-slice (I think that's what they call it) and pizookie were all favorites as well!

I left Arizona eight years ago and have really missed Oregano's! I have had good, Italian fare in Chicago and still prefer the food at Oregano's, that says a lot! Since I started eating at Oregano's they have gone from two locations to 16! Obviously they are doing something right!"}
{"text":"We've been eating at this location since it opened almost 15 years ago and it's awesome like the other locations! (Tempe is still the best though)

Stopped in today and I had the chicken pesto individual stuffed pizza lunch special (similar to Lou Malnati's or Rosati's deep dish/stuffed - only better!) My wife had the Pasta Basta with shredded chicken (all-time favorite for both of us). The Heck of a Slice is really good as well if you like Chicago thin crust style pizza. ** Note - They make a limited amount of the daily special stuffed pizzas for one (they easily feed two people) and they only serve them at lunch. But they are priced right! $6.99!!!

The food was excellent as was the service! (Always is!) This location is adjacent to a strip mall and has much more parking than all the other locations we've been to.

If you like LOTS of pasta and Chicago thin crust and/or deep dish pizza, then you will like Oregano's! 

** I'm from Chicago (not the suburbs) and have had Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, Leona's, Nancy's, Connie's, Gino's East, Uno's, JB Alberto's and many more. Oregano's is just as good!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Phoenix, I take all my friends, family, and visitors here! Never been disappointed! Great thin crust, and deep dish is my hangover cure!  Oregano salad is the best! Cheesy bread is great!  Top notch service, and they always offer me a soda for free with to go orders!"}
{"text":"First time in, ordered a stuffed deep dish pizza to go.
Waited over a hour in the bar. When we finally got home with our pizza, we discovered the bottom was mostly black,  all you could taste was burnt. Called the Manager Sherry to complain, She
 made it right. Not sure if I'll be back"}
{"text":"I come here once a week for lunch take out and am usually a happy customer. However, today when i finally got to work and opened my container of big rig pasta i was extremely disappointed to see that the container was not even half way full. Not even joking i could count the number of rigatoni pasta noodles that were in the container. Even my coworkers were like that's a ripoff you should take it back. While the pasta was delicious as always I am still super hungry. :("}
{"text":"A great tip for this place is to eat at the bar. Full service and not a 1:15 waite. Sit at the bar Leah M . will give you the attention and detail. The food is a piece of utter magnificence. The service is unrivaled. The only thing id worry about is the fact their are no misters on the porch ateas. Hopefully. They wont make the mistake of no misters So 15 tables outside will be comfortable in 115 degree weather."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate step daughters bday 18 had 10 people.
  Sever alex gave us all great a++ service. 
Unfortunatly the pizzas were very very salty and spicy.  Guacatony was great so was the antipasta salad and galic cheese   was nice to get in soo soon without a 45 to hr waite. 
 Enclosed are some pics of the food."}
{"text":"I'm not trying to be that guy but I'm about to be in the nicest way because I have been in the restaurant  industry for almost 10 years but to mess up a to go order twice is kind of hard to believe. First I called and I asked for three of the mac & cheese with jalapeños and I had called back to confirm one with no breading then when I go to pick it up the guy said he put them all with bacon . I don't even eat bacon and I don't even eat any meat so I'm confused as to where they got the  bacon from. So they remade them. I had told him one with no breading as he asked the cook if had made them already. The cook said yeah but they would remake it. Than I had told him while he was telling the cook one with no breading . And he said okay but still didn't tell the cook one with no breading. I got my order a  girl came and let me know they didn't put the jalapeños in the mac & cheese honestly I was cool with it like whatever just put it on the side but then when I got home I realize they didn't even saute The jalapeños like I'm so confused. Then I realize they put breaking on all of them. I'm not upset because I totally understand it was just miscommunication  and the service was really awesome like I still love this place and she did offer to remake it again but three minutes till close I understand how it is to close the restaurant down I'm not going to be that guy to have them remake it three times and she did offer me a cookie but cookie does not offer me 40 minutes of my time wasted when I'm hungry. I'm just disappointed I guess I'm not mad but that sucks. It took 40 minutes for 3 Mac n cheese appetizers that were never corrected. I'm eating this it's good but not as good as usual."}
{"text":"Shout out to Justin at this Oregano's location! The several times we have eaten at Oregano's in Surprise, we've had the pleasure to be waited on by this young man. Justin you help make our dining experience the very best, and have us continuing to return to dine here! Yes, the pizza is great. Yes, the chicken parm is delicious. Yes, the salads are fantastic! However it's the customer service that has us returning time, and time again. We don't mind the wait, as long as we are being waited on by Justin. Justin exhibits what good customer service is all about! We see a great future for you, Justin! Thank you!! Jo Ann & Brian"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my mother. That was the first mistake.  We wanted to sit outside and it smelled like smoke.  We were told no smoking on patio but the day us inside. The server took are drink order then we ordered after 25 minutes asked to check on our food he returned it's coming  another 10 min asked again it is coming up right now again waited 12 minutes later said to server we were just going to leave he raises his voice and directs toward my mother that the food was coming and that what we ordered takes 30 min. So finally manager brought the food said sorry and again reminded us of the 39 min. At this time I am pretty done and want to get out oh did I say we sat by a screaming child.   Told manager to just bring me a box and take my card we would like to leave.  She offered to pay for our meal I said no sorry giving me a free meal what will fix this place I paid and left. The real problem large group and mid size group came in and we were forgotten.  I would stay clear or go to another location."}
{"text":"This is a family favorite!  The thin crust pizza is the best I've ever had!  The Vino Bambino salad is fantastic as well. Their kids menu is a hit and very reasonably priced. Don't forget to order a Pizza Cookie before you leave - a great dessert that will keep you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Been a while since I've been to an Oregano's. Took my wife since we've both been wanting to come here for a while. To start with the food it was okay. Both my wife I thought the food had a bacon taste which for me was okay, there was no bacon in what I ordered. My wife being pescetarian disliked her food. Service was absolutely horrid. I swear our server forgot about us. No refills, no friendly service. First time here (at this location), last time here. Don't recommend. My server was Jake and he just cost you our business."}
{"text":"It was okay. I put my family on the waitlist and showed up right on time. I thought because I put us on the wait list we would be able to be seated right away. That wasn't the case. It made for very cranky baby and toddler."}
{"text":"Excellent delicious food! Service borders on Spectacular! We have never enjoyed dinner that much before. I would go broke if I lived close to a location."}
{"text":"The food, as always is very good.  The service as always is OUTSTANDING.  The wait staff is the BEST.  \"Tina Fey\" is the most courteous and efficient."}
{"text":"so what that it's a chain?! is it owned by some cold, indifferent corporation from another city/state?! no, it's a great little place with a fantastic vibe, delicious food and a great value for the price. i could do with a few less children, but it's a family restaurant and that's what you get. every time i go to phoenix, i make it a point to eat here just once...you should, too!"}
{"text":"Yes, I like this place!  They have good pizza and great salads!  Cute restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place far exceeded our expectations. Based on the reviews, we knew it was going to be good. From the second we walked in, on a Friday night no less, we had incredible service. We did have to wait but again, it was a Friday night. The service was outstanding as it didn't feel like we had only 1 server. It felt as though multiple people were helping to make sure our experience was a good one. I cannot wait to come here again and again and again. Do yourself and your family a favor and come eat here."}
{"text":"We love Oregano's, but this one isn't up to power. Pre ordered a deep dish so it would be really when we were seated and it showed up burt."}
{"text":"The Oregano's Favorite salad was nothing short of amazing. The dressing was the perfect balance with all of the ingredients! We also got the Chicago pan which was very, very good!"}
{"text":"Helped my daughter move to Phoenix , to tired to go out, placed a to go order . What a great dinner, their version of   guacamole and chips is amazing , garlic chicken, meatball sub delicious . Portions are so generous we had several meals"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunxh.  The wait is unneeded.  The restaurant had plenty of tables open and still they made customers wait.  The food is decent, but nothing special.  This location has above average service which is the reason for giving 3 stars and not less."}
{"text":"Very good Chicago style deep dish pizza!  Good location south of Loop 202, excellent pizza, good service, & great atmosphere.  Don't be fooled by the menu, almost everything on the menu comes in large portions, especially the pizza since is so deeep dish. =)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Ordered pasta and it was pretty good. Haven't tried the pizza yet. The service was amazing. Our waiter was on top of things. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is great. Wait can be long but if you time it right it is reasonable. Tonight we had no wait. Food is excellent"}
{"text":"The stuffed mushrooms are WONDERFUL! Location is too small, not enough seating and the atmosphere is very hectic...AS chains go it not bad and is reasonably priced for a quick meal, or a beer and some appetizers to watch a game.  This location has a great outdoor covered Patio/Bar which is great for Arizona during fall, winter and spring months!"}
{"text":"We were sat very quickly, however after that it was down hill. Service was slow. It was way too loud. Drinks were good put the food was hit and miss."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of Oreganos, but have never had such horrible service as we did today. The restaurant was fairly slow but the few tables around us were also very upset with the poor service. Our server walked past our table 4 times without saying a thing to us and after 10 minutes, he complained to us that he had been \"fixing the restaurant\"(which should be the managers job) and took our order. We watched our food sit in the window for almost 10 minutes while servers walked back and forth without doing anything. This is totally unlike the typical Oreganos experience!"}
{"text":"Oregano's, you screwed me. The first time I went here, I went based upon someone's recommendation. I wrote you a fair balanced review and in turn, I thought we had an understanding. I wouldn't rip you a new one and you would insure that if I ever came back, you would provide some consistency to he food. I never said your food was stellar, I just wanted to get the same crap I got the first time. I upheld my end of the bargain, you took my fair review and screwed me. On my second visit, I ordered a meatball sub, again. I wanted the Jr. The same as I had before when you included the waffle fries that were not needed. This time you served me a whole sub, not what I wanted and there were no fries. I didn't want them, but where were they? How was the sub? Yuck! I could have got a better meatball sub at Subway. Do you understand how insulting that comment was? Oregano's, I said Subway. That is bad, dude! Bad!! I guess what we have determined is that you just suck. You are another horrible, fake Italian restaurant, serving food that Chef Boyardee would be ashamed to put his face on.

Oh yeah, where was the cute blonde at the register? If you are going to serve bad food, always make sure there is a cute blonde serving me, not a fat guy with glasses in a white t-shirt. That just makes the whole experience even worse."}
{"text":"When this food touches your tonge you will be in heaven food taste so great you won't be able to name another Italian restaurant, portions are big enough to share or to take home and belive me this is food you won't let go bad in the fridge it even taste great reheated oh servers are always full of energy and very nice, this is a chain restaurant but everyone is consistent and it taste the same from one restaurant to the next iv been in 4 different ones across Arizona they were all the same"}
{"text":"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza cookie pie, that's amore! Really, what other reason is there to come here if not for the pizza cookie. It's the size of an adults head with gooey chocolate, soft cookie dough center, crispy edges, 3 giant piles of delicious vanilla ice cream........
I've lost my train of thought.....

Aside from the amazing cookies, the food is good all around. There's a reason this place is PACKED at all times. The boom dip is a personal favorite along with the thin crust pizza. The portions are huge and it is so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is so close to home we walk. The Pablo Picasso and a chz deep dish pizza is our go to! Oh and the yummy basket of waffle fries when I'm stoned is scrumptious!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The food is really good, the wine is really well priced, the beer list is interesting enough for beer lovers or novices and the patio is great for dining with children.  

I like the new location as parking is MUCH easier and one doesn't feel so claustrophobic when you dining inside the restaurant.   I have never had a bad meal here nor have I ever had crappy service.  The dough balls and cookie desert are great touches for the kiddos as well.  

They are doing something right..."}
{"text":"Came in 15 min to close and they said I can't order. I said that I have came in 15 minutes before close before and the girl stated \"I mean you can order.....\" We did not feel welcomed at all. Horrible service. Will not return."}
{"text":"Love this place. Never ending bowl of pasta and a thin crust for the family. Ordered the guacatoni appetizer today. Amazing. The cheese crisp they serve it with is magic. I noticed today the pizza was better without pepperoni. Will go with just cheese next time. He diet Pepsi is perfect. Price is ok. Service is usually really good. Tonight's was great. Usually always a long wait. Only down side tonight."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza is really good.  I needed 4 large pizzas last second for an event and they were able to get it done and everyone loved the pizza.  Thin, chewy, and very good tasting."}
{"text":"I love the new Oregenos ! It is huge .....  In fact, I cannot find the bathroom right now.  I am in some sort of broom closet Yelping ....... Don't worry I am not going to use this bucket ..."}
{"text":"This is a stand out restaurant on Scottsdale Road. We have been coming here for 15 years (some of that time they were in a previous location further north on Scottsdale). My husband and I have two rules for restaurants. 1. Value - the prices must be a good value for us to keep coming back. Oregano's definitely fits the bill.  2. Great food - you can't go wrong with the food. Everything is GREAT! My favorite salad is the Pablo Picasso and our fave pizza is the pesto with sausage."}
{"text":"Everyone likes good Italian food, but not everyone likes pretentious places like Carraba's, or even that horrid Olive Garden. Come as you are, and enjoy some good pie. I like a good deep dish, and Oregano's doesn't disappoint. Get something like Gorgonzola and you'll thank me later! Just aim for the less traditional toppings and you'll be alright. I haven't had much of the entrees, but the portions are generous and the quality for many the same as you'll find at other chain Italian eateries.

The drinks are hit or miss. Order the frozen bellini, it's amazing no matter what the season!  

It's not the most original or tantalizing Italian fare, but Oregano's gets the job done. In style. Give it a try.

PS-Service improved greatly. Guest services was waaaay nicer than they had to be. Never turn down a place that cares about your experience!"}
{"text":"Venturing out to Goodyear can be a bit daunting. It's a long drive. Everything is soooo far apart! Oregano's might be the best restaurant out here, so it's no wonder it was impossible to get into on a Sunday afternoon. 

We started out with a wait of about 20 minutes. OMG the wait is killer when there's nothing nearby to wait in, but between the nice weather and host handing out pizza samples, it was still alright. 

Finally made it in, and I must say I liked it! The view from the inside was very nice. They have so many staff members that I never felt like I was forgotten about. My pizza was made very skillfully, and fortunately didn't even take a whole 45 minutes. I thought this would be a pretty weak location, but it ended up proving more desirable than my usual in CenPho. Would recommend...I mean, if you actually have to be out here for some reason."}
{"text":"First time here. Great experience the hostess staff is very warm and welcoming and our waiters Ashlynn went above and beyond make sure we got everything in a timely manner. The food that we had was so fun and delicious. Had the brussel sprouts that came in a mini iron skillet, a wonderful house salad with a lemon vinaigrette. The cheese bread with marinara sauce was to die for and could have served a family of 4. And in the Spiroccoli Pizza which was a thin crusted  broccoli and spinach, on it on top of a marinara sauce was to die for"}
{"text":"i really don't care for the deep dish pizza here.

it's smothered in sauce and doesn't appear to have quality cheese.

i'll have to try the pastas next time!"}
{"text":"The service here is consistently good with attentive, attractive hosts (eye candy for everyone here).  I'm not a fan of their pizzas (crust is cracker thin or deep dish variants which I have never been a fan of anywhere but Chicago proper), but good garlic bread (GIANT portion size), calzones and salads/entrees.  The highlight however is the pizzuokie which is fresh baked chocolate chip cookie in a deep dish pan with ice cream on top and the meat ball sub (make sure to get it with grilled peppers and onions)"}
{"text":"Great environment, but the service was slow. The pizza crust was limp had to hold the pizza with two hands to eat."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Everything I get here I am impressed. Make me crave it. This location is great too. Great staff."}
{"text":"The food here is worth every penny. It is cheap and yet huge and satisfying. If you dont like oreganos something is wrong with you.. It is so amazing that you go home and think about it.. I mean dream about it.. YUMMMMY! :)"}
{"text":"This review is just for the bazookie dessert, cookie with ice cream. It was such a whirlwind evening I don't even recall seeing this on the menu before it showed up at our table. As we pulled up into the lot right before they were closing we ordered 2 of these and quickly, illegally parked to devour our dessert. Imagine warm succulent cookie dough, crispy crust on the outside, warm gooey in the middle, and just cold ice cream floating on top. Orgasmic Heaven!!
when is this coming to California?!?!
Oh, the staff is warm and friendly and treats you like family even when they are about to close.
Go!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian concept I have ever been to. Classic old building with a vintage design and colour. Absolutely amazing. Hand paintings on wall and canvas. House Merlot was great. Was served with a complimentary garlic bread and cheese. Bread was toasted, crusty outside, soft inside with hot meaty cheese on top with a hint of garlic butter. After my friend ordered a salad. That bowl of salad can feed 3 people at the reasonable price. At last I have ordered a pasta dish lady is a scampi. I can only say.... OH MY GOD. Pasta was good perfectly, moist but not too saucy. Shrimp was HUGE and crunch. The size of the shrimp is bigger then my thumb. Will be back when I have a chance to go back to AZ."}
{"text":"Why won't Helen Keller drive? 

Because she has to park in a shady neighborhood every time she goes to Oregano's. 

But other than that I hear, I mean, I see her signing that she loves the meatball sandwich and pizza this place has. 

Service gets a little slow because this place is always packed but if you get the stuffed mushrooms it makes it worth it. 

Also, they only have one dessert, which makes it easy for your date to choose...or sign"}
{"text":"Great first time experience. One thing to realize to all the naysayers about speed. This is not a fast food restaurant.nor is it intended to he. Fast food has ruined dining experiences. This place is old school. It is a dining experience. Why does it take long to get a pizza during busy times? Because there is only so much room in the ovens. It's that simple. If you don't have patience then go to a drive thru. If you want quality food with quality service. Then come here. The menu is large. Wide variety of stuff. The wait is worth it. Great job folks."}
{"text":"Our waitress \"Ashlynn\" was great.  No issues, food was delicious and we had leftovers to enjoy later!
Appreciate the great service and the fact that we didn't have to continually ask for drink refills.

We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for some togo pizza and salad on our way to the parents house a few nights ago. O's was on the way and I remember always having good pizza from there. 

It wasn't too expensive either, $30 or so for two 14 inchers and a large Cesar salad. We got a Hawaiian and a simple peperoni. Both were tasty, not out of this world, but good. The Cesar was very good, love the dressing. 

We also had a cocktail while we waited for our order. It was a little difficult to get a drink, the bar was packed so we flagged down a waitress to take our order, took a few minutes, but finally we got our drinks. I got a Bellini, looked amazing! tasted good too, but it was strong so I couldn't finish it, as our food arrived a few moments later. 

In the past I remember them having great salads and very yummy aps, like the BOMB dip and cheese bread, a few walked by us and I seriously regretted not order them to go as well. 

A few tips, if you are going for dinner get there with time to spare and have a cocktail on the patio while you wait for your table, they pretty much always have a wait, but the misting system out there is nice. Also, the cookie dessert is amaze-ballz! Get one for sure! Order it early though, it takes awhile to make."}
{"text":"The Alfredo After Dark had good taste but was luke warm and dry,  I ask for some additional Alfredo sauce thinking it would solve both conditions.  It was still very dry and when the waiter asked if it was ok I said maybe another sauce would do the trick. It fixed the dryness but by that time the pasta was just about room temperature.  It was our anniversary and I really did not want to make a big deal out of it and ruin the evening for my wife.  So, I just \"moved on\" quietly.  I paid the bill and left without paying too much attention to it as I knew pretty much what it should be.  Next day I handed the receipt to my wife to put int  the check book and noticed we had been charge $.99 for each additional Alfredo sauce, something I did not expect especially since the cause was the condition of the food.  Next day I went back to the restaurant and spoke with \"Don\" a manager in training.  I explained what had happened I told him that the extra $1.98 was not about  the money but the principle.  He said it was standard practice to charge for \"extra\" and that it was something all businesses were doing.  It also helped control what food went out from the kitchen, so servers did not provide extra items to friends.  (Wow, trust and mutual appreciation must be abundant at Oregano's.)  After what I felt like was a lecture he said he would go to the back and give me a small gift card and refund the two dollars.  While he was away I had decided to not accept anything as I felt like he either did not here what I was trying to tell him or he simply was not listening.  He came back with the 2 dollars and no card.  I told hime to keep the money and left.  Not gong back."}
{"text":"The staff was very attentive and educated about the menu and preparation of the meals.  Gluten Free Pasta was added just recently.  The Marinara, Alfredo and Big Rig Sauces are all gluten free.  Plus they can grill up a gluten free crust to dip into the Spinach artichoke dip.  Was the greatest meal!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a take out salad and meatballs this evening and was stuffed. The food was great and more than enough for me. My son took me here when he was a student at ASU and I return when I here for business. Always a great meal and great employees to take care of you. If you want a good meal, this place is the best."}
{"text":"It was our first time at this location in Surprise. We were visiting family and decided to dine here. Our server Cecilia I believe... she was awesome. She was kind and very informative. It was so busy from what we could see but service never lacked. She made the visit very pleasant and we never had to ask her for anything. She was always one step ahead. It was awesome! I had the Picasso Salad. It was super refreshing and was sooooo good. Thank you to the cooks as well. We will definitely be back when we're back in this city."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Oregano's. I have two words for this place: carbs + cheese. We started out with the kickbutt garlic bread, which was a loaf about the length of my arm and forearm combined. Adding that extra $1.00 cheese to the bread was definitely worth it.  I simply couldn't resist that garlicky, buttery spread. You also have the option of dipping it with homemade marinara for an extra $.89. We also had the zany ziti pasta, which was ziti pasta with a sausage sauce intermixed with four Italian cheeses. It was deliciously cheesy. In terms of pizza, we ordered the 12\" pan pizza with cheese starting at $13.99, adding Cajun chicken & Roma tomatoes for $1.99 each topping. There were 30 different toppings to choose from. The crust was thick & crispy to my liking. I definitely utilized the red pepper flakes and oregano shakes at the table. My friend also requested extra cheese added to the pasta, and was given freshly grated parmesan - always a plus. The food was amazing, but I plan to do some cardio tonight and eat a lot of fiber. It might be wise to order one of their big salads to fill you up to avoid indulging too much.  On the way out, they have an abundance of peppermint candy and fortune cookies up for grabs. 

This place is always busy. We waited about 20 minutes around lunchtime on a Saturday before being seated. I would love to give this place four stars, but the service really needs improvement. Our server initially forgot to bring us the missing set of utensils. We had to ask for it again. While we were dining in, she did not refill our waters. I do give her credit for checking on us once in awhile, and boxing up our food. After paying with my credit card, we were about to leave when I double checked the receipt and noticed it was charged incorrectly. We were billed for the previous table's check on top of ours. I would have been paying an extra $24 for one extra pizza and drink that I did not order.  I was not a happy camper. Remember to check your bill carefully."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night and there was a small crowd waiting outside.  We didn't have to wait too long to get a table inside though.  Really cute, but small place.  Our waiter was really friendly and rattled off some recommendations. We split a caesar salad and a baked ziti.  It was served inside a crust bowl.  Really interesting.  It was hard as a rock and didn't have a lot of flavor. The real star was the desert- salted caramel cookie with ice cream. He said they like to feed you, and he wasn't lying. We were stuffed and I can't even imagine finishing an entrée on my own. The portions were huge. I'd definitely choose a different main dish next time, but the service was really top notch."}
{"text":"Probably the best Italian place in the West valley.  Anna, our server, was on point the whole time.  My chicken parm was as good as  I can make at home (high praise).  My wife's lasagna was pretty incredible.    My daughter was the bravest of us and ordered the mushroom pasta.   She barely made a dent in it because the portion size was umm... generous.  She asked for a box because this is on of the few meals that she wants to eat again tomorrow.  

Tl;dr    food great, anna awesome."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY IF YOU DONT WANT TO GET SICK!! 
Me and my husband went to this location on 6/28. Ordered wings and pizza. We have been to this location a few times and never had a problem. This time, we got food poisoning from the chicken wings! A few hours of eating there we were throwing up and had severe diarrhea! I reported it to the managers the next day. It took them 2 weeks to get back to me. This is after I called them to check up on why no one had called me to follow up. Oregano's wouldn't even refund the wings, after their so called investigation. Bad customer service. They have lost our business for good!"}
{"text":"Because the food is good and the bartender Jenn is the reason for 10++ stars friendly, efficient energetic just a gem.  She is a super STAR!"}
{"text":"I normally am very happy with oreganos but tonight I ordered take out and was very disappointed. I ordered the original bollo pasta and the noodles came out very over done. The pasta was so over cooked it stuck to itself and broke off in chunks. There was a very thin layer of sauce on top that was enough for about 1/3 of the noodles. After I got through the layer of sauce I was left with 2/3 of a bowl of inedible pasta. However, we also ordered the zany ziti dish and it came out perfect. Next time I probably will avoid ordering to go."}
{"text":"I came in for the first time with my parents for a late lunch a couple weeks ago and it struck me as odd that the only seating options inside were booths or high-top tables. No regular tables?? What if I don't want to be jammed inside a booth, or have to sit with my ass raised four feet in the air with a dress on? Right. Okay, should have gone somewhere else if I wanted a normal table-chair set up. 

Anyway, after I scooted 10 feet across the booth, we were greeted by a waitress with a terrible artificial red short hair color job who seemed nice, but really dense..kind of like the pizza! We decided to share some toasted ravioli, a salad, and a pan style numero-whatever they call it pizza. I originally asked for the stuffed version, but she indicated that particular pizza takes approximately 45 minutes to bake. 

Who has 45 minutes to sit around in a booth waiting for a pizza? Lesson: We would have appreciated that information right off that bat upon receiving menus. 

Anyway, the toasted ravioli was a great starter, something savory-crunchy-cheesy to set the tone for the pizza- I definitely recommend it. And then out came this ENORMOUS FREAKING salad. The three of us just stared at it, and then attempted, with zero success, to portion it out without making a mess. By the time we each finished, there was salad debris all over the table, and half remaining on the plate. And looking back, it really wasn't that great.

Mom: Is this the smallest size they have???
Me: I think so, I didn't ask for the big one. 
-Enter waitress from stage left with pizza: How's the salad guys?
Me: Um, we're going to need a box, I'm surprised this is the smaller size.
Waitress (with deer in headlights stare): Oh! Uhum... this is the larger size, I'm sorry I didn't know you wanted to smaller one! 
Me (annoyed): Why would you just assume that we wanted the larger one?

At that point it had been 30 minutes since we ordered and I just wanted some mf'ing pizza. And it was good...great actually...but not the best. The toppings were fresh, sauce portion was just right, and cheese was everywhere. 

Aside from the assuming service, I would come back again for the pizza, or just order ahead. I didn't cover the bill so I don't know if we got charged the large salad price, but if we did, and I ever see that waitress again, I would bluntly ask for someone else and state why. Obviously the waitress put a huge damper on my first experience here, so hopefully it will improve in the future."}
{"text":"Meatball sandwich outstanding and the bistro beef salad. Both are large portions and delicious."}
{"text":"Welcome to Lemming-ville. Went for a second visit. The first was a pick-up order that was horrible. The artichoke in the dip was so hard it was like eating corn husks. And the crust on the pizza was over-seasoned. We went again, this time for a dine-in. I must say, it was better. The service was great as well. But, everything else was certainly not worthy of the hundred dollars we spent for a couple and three kids ages 8, 6 and 1. The eight year old didn't even have anything. The bruschetta was good, but the bread was more like croutons. The pizza was actually good, but the crust was still over-seasoned. If I am going to spend that much on pizza, it'll be at Pomo or Bianco.  Sorry. I don't get why this place is so famous, other than most people are lemmings."}
{"text":"Went for a quick express lunch. Waited for awhile for a table even though plenty of them were empty. We were told they had to clean one for us. Once seated, we ordered a slice of pizza each. Also ordered some chicken parm to go for a family member at home. Told the waitress to bring the pizza but take their time cooking the chicken since it was to go. A half an hour later, no pizza was produced. There were many empty booths in our section and only one table was being served salad, and then some entree they ordered. I guess our order was not \"priority\". Why advertise that if you want a quick lunch, to order from that section of the menu, if you are going to not rush the thin crust cardboard pizza crust with bare minimum sauce and cheese? It was the worst excuse for a slice of pizza I ever had. Epic fail Oreganos!"}
{"text":"I attended a rehearsal dinner at this location in their private room. We had red and white wine served continuously and a buffet style meal. The service was AWESOME!  The staff was very attentive, fast and courteous. 
We had several different pizzas, 2 types of salad and a rigatoni pasta dish. As the name suggests, all the food here is heavy on the herbs and spices. Everything I had was delicious (and I had a bit of everything :)). Dessert was the best part (of course). We each were served individual cups with a half baked cookie and vanilla ice cream on top- I highly recommend trying this!
I like the atmosphere of this restaurant and the interesting decor. The private room was perfect for any celebration or business meeting. They have a flat screen tv that can be used for presentations, but for the dinner I attended we did not need it. 
The only downside to the private room was they did not have cable on the tv, so we could not watch the basketball game that was on. That wasn't a big deal for us though."}
{"text":"I hate dealing with this location, they're slow as hell and rude. Every time I place a call for a pickup there's always a 3+ hour wait for pickup and when you go into the actual location for a sit down dinner you'll spend 3 hours waiting to be seated and for your food to arrive. Also note the staff isn't as knowledgeable about the menu as some of the other locations so you may find yourself telling them about things on the menu.

I questioned them about this long wait and was told it's because they're the only location on the west side....we'll the 10th St & Camelback location has been catering to the ENTIRE Central Phoenix area for years with no issues and the manager just looked at me.

Save yourself the trouble and call the 10th street & Camelback location."}
{"text":"Great food and service as usual.  Esther was an awesome server and made our visit enjoyable!  We will definitely be back again!  ThBk you Esther and Oreganos!"}
{"text":"Closest Pizza to Chicago that I could find!!!!!
Liked it a lot! Service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I went here on the last day of my vacation to Phoenix. along with my cousin and her boyfriend. They suggested it, and said they had taken several family members there when they also had come to visit. Parking is crowded, but upon arriving, I found the fun red, white, and green color bright and festive and espcially liked the patio. Even though it was 100+degrees, dining on the patio is comfortable because of the powerful fans and misters they have surrounding it. 
Oreganos seems to draw a younger crowd, at least at this location. The menu is big, and the portions are huge, as other Yelpers have noted. My husband and I ordered a thin crust Combination pizza, a medium. My cousin ordered a salad, her boyfriend ordered a pasta dish with cream sauce. As an appetizer we had cheesy garlic bread which was good. Our pizza was way too much food for just the two of us, and had an abundance of toppings. The crust was light and flaky, not soggy. We were pleased with it and gave it to my cousin to finish for lunch the following day. Not my favorite pizza, but a good one. I still love Round Table back home in Cali. I don't know if they have this chain in Phoenix??"}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty standard, nothing special but decent. I am a huge fan of the hot cookies though. That is what this review is for. I don't usually come to Oregano's unless I know I am getting a hot cookie for dessert. My favorite is the chocolate chip which comes with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. Best to share with a friend is it is rather large."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Portions are large, we split a salad and deep dish pizza with enough to bring home left-overs. 
Cookie is outrageous!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the service of this location. Not something I'm used to or have come to expect when comparing to the other locations. 
An extreme disappointment. 
My pasta was cold, Bellinis are always watered down and service is crappy. We're not just talking one time but repeatedly. 
I've been going to Oreganos since there was only one location in Scottsdale, and it's never disappointed... until now. 
Drive to another location trust me. If it wasn't for the other locations I wouldn't be going back. 
It's truly a shame."}
{"text":"This place was great! I was in Arizona last year, visiting some friends, and they took me to Oregano's in Gilbert. We got there around 7 pm on a Sunday evening and decided to sit on the patio. I was scared it would still be too hot, but they had air conditioners blasting outside by the table as well as a misty sprinkler system above the patio. Awesome! 

We elected to get a Chicago style deep dish pizza which takes like 45 minutes to make, so we just threw back a couple of ice cold draft beers and the pizza was out in no time. Having the deep dish pizza was a treat because we don't really have too many places that specialize in Chicago style pizza on the west coast. 

The service was outstanding as well. When we were waiting for a table, we went to the bar to get a beer, and the bar tender was on top of his game even though it was chaotic. Our waiter was also very friendly. It turned out that the waiter's fiance was from my home town. Small world. Overall it was a great experience, and I look forward to stopping by again next time I'm in the Phoenix area. 

5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten inside the restaurant, so I can't comment on the ambience or service.  My parents have ordered takeout a few times, and I feel it's been enough that I can write a review without feeling like it was a one time fluke.  Each time we've gotten the pizza from there.  Different toppings - sometimes bacon, sometimes veggies, sometimes just plain cheese.  We always get the wafer thin crust and it is delicious.  I imagine getting it in house would make it even crispier piping hot out of the oven, but it holds up well if you do pickup the pizza.  The sauce is nicely flavored with garlic and just enough spices and herbs that the cheese alone is great.  All of the toppings seem very fresh and are great - try the caramalized onions!  I haven't tried the deep dish pizza though I have heard it is very good - I like the thinness of the thin crust, and I dont' feel as guilty eating it.  Plus, I can eat a little bit more of thin crust.  Deep dish pizza I only get to eat the one slice cause it's so heavy.  But you know Americans nowadays, the more you get to eat, the better!  (haha, this is why our nation is so huge.........)"}
{"text":"love, love,love it!  and my kids love it.  friendly, great service and the food is outstanding.  Having lived in Chicago, i can tell you it is a very good resemblence to Chicago style pizza.  the thin crust is also amazing.    2 must haves: bruchetta for appetizer and the warm cookie for dessert!"}
{"text":"This place has a good location far enough away from campus that it doesn't feel flooded all the time with people. Great tasting pizza with fresh ingredients. One of the best things about this place is the desserts. The pazookie or cookie with ice cream is one to try and share with friends. Great ambiance as well."}
{"text":"There's no end of fancy schmancy pasta places out there, with the accompanying fancy schmancy price.  Even when they're not so fancy, you still are left wondering why you're paying so much money for a bowl of something that's essentially noodles with a spiced tomato and onion sauce poured on top of it.

Look, I LOVE my Italian food, and I certainly like visiting the Old Spaghetti Factory as well as Babbo's on occasion, but even these places leave me thinking that their price is a bit inflated.  It left me wondering whether or not there was a \"cheap pasta place\" out there--a joint that would serve up a decent noodles and sauce for a price that I would expect for noodles and sauce.

Oregano's--this is IT!  If all you're looking for a simple bowl of pasta like Nonna used to make, you need to order the \"Bollo Pasta\" from this place.  It's bottomless, and the dinner version is $6.99.  The marinara is a little spicy (Southern Italian style), but really great.  If you're hungry, your $6.99 will get you as much as you want until you're ready to unbuckle your belt and go to sleep.

This is the best bang for your buck Italian that you will find in the Valley, hands down.  Is it the absolute best pasta taste?  No, but for a few bucks, you can get satisfying pasta 'till you want to basta.

Oh, and their pizza is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Went last night and there was a long wait so we decided to order Togo instead. Although they were overwhelmed with customers, the food came out fast and fresh! Got home and the pizza and wings were amazing definitely going to visit again very soon!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain. But it is a local chain, family owned. There's a reason it's busy. Quality food. Sometimes the service could be better, sometimes it's outstanding. The appetizers are wonderful. We get the Chicago style thin crust pizza. Some folks may not be familiar with this style pizza that is popular in the south side of Chicago. This is not hand tossed pizza like NY style. It is machine rolled thin crust. Very thin. And delicious. 

The dinner salads are large and fresh. Very tasty and a great value. Everyone raves about the ice cream and cookie desert...because it is AWESOME!

Plan on a wait to get a table, and a wait for your food. It's worth it. A family favorite at our house.

Hint: only for you fellow Chicagoans...green olives are available as a topping."}
{"text":"It's a great fusion of Italian meets America. Different takes of pasta and pizza. You can get traditional pasta and pizza, or mix it up with their signature dishes. 

We ordered the Alfredo The Dark pasta and the Clark Street Meat Pizza! Both delicious! The pasta was creamy and and cheesy. Tasted great with the chicken! The pizza was thin with a crispy crust topped with sausages and basil. Refreshing and filling! 

If you have more room, I'd suggest to try the half baked cookie with vanilla ice cream. Sweet, chewy, warm and cold all at once! Sign up to be a member and get your first dessert free!"}

{"text":"This place is located in a great location, right off the Frwy. There is a lot of parking, no need to worry about circling the parking lot to find a space in the 110° weather. The establishment was clean and had an Italian atmosphere with the authentic decor. Service was great, I was greeted by at least 6-7 staff members that said Hello & Welcome to Oregano's. As for the food, I'm no food critic, but let's just say I'm still on the hunt for some great tasting Italian food in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service, great food. Usually end up getting the Bollo pasta. The only negative about this location is that it's hard to get seats inside when it's cold or rainy, as the outdoor seating takes up about a third of the room. One of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite (if not our absolute favorite) spots. The food is amazing, but what really makes this place great is the friendly and expeditious service. Richard is one of the best bartenders I've had the pleasure of dealing with. Do yourself a favor, and check this place out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I ordered a thin crust pizza for carry out from this location.  The staff was very friendly and the pizza was pretty good.  I look forward to trying their pasta in the near future."}
{"text":"I come to Oreganos often but was very displeased with the communication and management. We came on Father's Day for just dessert and was told it would be a 30 min wait (which is fine). We were then told by the hostess we would only have to wait the same amount for a to go order. So we took our name off the list and went to order to go only to find out that we would have to wait over an hour. When we went back to the hostess she said it was now a 45 minute wait and we would need to add our name to the list again. 
As much as we love oreganos, it is frustrating that there was no communication and we left hungry and upset."}
{"text":"Put our name on list for 7 people at 6:10 and were told it would be an hour wait. Still here at 7:56...and no table. Told my family this wasn't worth the hour wait they advised it would be...and certainly not worth almost 2 hours!

Al, the manager, did give complementary garlic cheese bread, but still not coming back. Don't know how you miss-estimate a wait by almost 100%."}
{"text":"Had the eggplant parm! Super delicious and tasted authentic. Our server was so nice and very attentive. The atmosphere is also really great in here. Will be back to satisy my Italian cravings. ;)"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday & the place was busy but we were seated right away. The service was pretty quick & since we don't have any Chicago deep-dish style pizza in our home city we wanted to try it here. We were warned it could be 45 minutes to an hour for our Stuffed Numero One-o that we wanted. We were willing to wait so we ordered a couple beers & salad while we waited.  

Everything was fresh & tasty. Our pie came out in 30-35 minutes & was well worth the wait - delicious & very filling. We ended the meal with a chocolate chip cookie pie dessert & it was awesome, too. 

GREAT food, good service & reasonably priced. We'd definitely return. I'd really give this place 4.5 stars. The service from our waiter was good but not outstanding enough for 5 stars."}
{"text":"This was an awesome treat. They have some unique pizzas. We got the cheeseburger pizza which wad amazing. This place has one of the best thin crusts I have ever had. The crust is foldable and not all stale like most thin cracker crusts. Will be revisiting."}
{"text":"Yum yum. Pizzas take a very, long time to come out. I would have given it 5 stars, but the time issue had to be factored in."}
{"text":"Good, solid pizza place with lots of charm and great service. Really good salads too.

Great place to go for a birthday -- the warm chocolate chip cookie w/ ice cream is sinful. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Great example of a four star restaurant,  Oregano's is feautred in so many credible publications.  I come from Northern IL and love the authentic Chicago feel.  The website is worth seeing.  

Best Place for a first date, voted Rep and New Times,

One of the most amazing desserts The Original Pizza Cookie.  I was in a class at ASU with 29 ladies and they all voted Oregano's the best dessert."}
{"text":"I'm an fan of Oregano's but don't like the wait so I don't usually go to Oregano's. I will only go if I can get there before 5:30. So tonight was the night. I had my son run in there to get us a table. No waiting line. Ya ya. 

We started out with their Big Julius Caesar Salad. This is their small salad. This was huge. We had four people and could barely finish this. So good and fresh. My wife could have just eaten the salad. We also ordered the large order of wings with BBQ sauce. Huge wings with lots of meat. Really love the wings with the ranch dipping sauce. Yum yum good. Of course we always order their Chicago thin crust pizza with sausage, meatballs, and mushrooms. Fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked. Loved the meatballs and sausage so good. I'm a fan of Oregano's pizza and wings. 

Of course we're stuffed but you can never and I mean NEVER leave Oregano's without their pizza cookie. A must. We had the half chocolate chip and peanut butter cookie topped with vanilla ice cream with chocolate chips sprinkles. To die for. So good. This always tops off a good meal. 

They are always known for their huge portions and tonight was not a disappointment. Service was great. Drinks were at our table in no time and surprisingly our food came out pretty quickly. Our server and the manager kept on coming by our table to make sure everything we good. Loved the service. 

Like I said before. Love Oregano's. Good food. Good atmosphere. Loud and fun place to eat. Just make sure you get there by 5:30 at the latest or else you could be waiting in line for a really really long time. We'll be back for sure. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Oreganos never lets me down! Every time I go the service is amazing, and the food NEVER disappoints! The thin crust pizza is very flavorful and doesn't feel to heavy. The pasta is to die for. Very consistent every time I go. The pazookie is hands down the BEST dessert evar!!! 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Oregano's.  You were pretty damn awesome.  It could have been that I was exhausted and starving, but I think not.  I think you were awesome because my thin crust pizza (my fav!) was delicious, your chianti was a good choice and because my server, Tessa, was great! I had the house salad and a O'Riva Pie and my only regret was not realizing that you do whole wheat crust and that I didn't order it.  

By the way, Scottsdale, you are filled with WEIRD people.  The people watching was fantastic and amusing."}
{"text":"Great service with big portions. Always expect a wait but they do try and make it as pleasant a wait as possible. I love everything I've had from there. A few of their dishes are a bit salty but their pizzas are great."}
{"text":"Great spot! I heard the wait can be kind of long, but we had no issues for lunch on a Monday. We shared one of the simpler pizzas, just cheese, tomato, and basil, but nonetheless, it was delicious and hit the spot. Thin crust was perfectly crispy and had a good topping:cheese:sauce ratio. I also loved the hot chocolate chip cookie with ice cream for dessert. It is apparently one of their specialities and, if I do say so myself, a must-get if you ever come by! Service is super friendly and their t-shirts have funny sayings on the back. Great place to get your pizza fix!"}
{"text":"The location is nice, just located south of oldtown Scottsdale. The food is decent, overpriced for what you are getting. The pizza is paper thin, I'd like to be full after I eat a pizza but this one leaves you hungry. Servers are friendly and generally are attentive but this place is way too overrated because of the food quality. It is good but not great and not deserving of 4 stars. Also, because of the font they use the menus are almost impossible to read in the dark."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they call it Oregano's, they should call it Garlic's (or Aglio's).  Everything is super large portions (not good or bad).  The food is very flavorful, but all kinda a bit over-the-top.   I feel that if they left off an ingredient or two in some of their pizzas, they'd be better. 

I'm close to giving it 3 Stars, but the food is so monumentally unhealthy that I rounded down rather than up."}
{"text":"My family and I just love this place. It's our favorite family restaurant. Although, they removed one of our favorite dishes - The Big ol' Ravioli. But we always love the pizza!
The thing we particularly love about this place is the fair prices, the unique and warm atmosphere, and that the servers are always very personable.  We always arrive between 4-5pm and usually don't have to wait. The outdoor patio is very pleasant.  We have probably dinned here 20 times and it's always been a good experience."}
{"text":"The pizza is super salty its definitely not all it was hyped up to be around town before it opened"}
{"text":"I came here with pretty high expectations. I had heard great things about the pizza and was excited to try things out. The parking at this location is kind of annoying. There is a small lot behind the restaurant and other than that there is a neighborhood you can park in. but make sure you read the no parking signs to avoid getting any tickets. 

We didn't call ahead or anything so we had to wit 40 minutes for a seat, but it was fine because we just sat at the bar. It was pretty crowded considering it was a Saturday at 6:00. The staff were very friendly and accommodating though. When we were seated I ordered and appetizer, the stuffed mushrooms. We were informed that the deep dish pizza took 40 minutes to make and I wanted something to munch on. The appetizer was super yummy. The sausage was a little spicy for my taste, but still really good. 

When our meal came out the pizza was definitely the best part. We got both thin crust and deep dish pizza and I enjoyed both. We got a pasta as well and I thought it was just meh. I wouldn't order it again. We got the cookie dough dessert which was also delicious. Overall the meal was super good, and the staff are really nice, but if you plan on coming (especially on a busy night) make sure you have a while to wait."}
{"text":"No complaints here. Exceltional experience! Food is unbelievable, smiles on all the staff's faces, ambiance wonderful, it's a family-oriented restaurant.

I had the endless pasta bowl - so yummy! 

MUST have the pizza cookie if you're going to do the experience right.

Love this business, recommended to friends in Chandler. Keep up the good work!

Was \"a little\" loud, but packing out the house that is too be expected

Oh, stopped by Sunday at noon and got right in. Blown away, as they can run up to 2 hour waits"}
{"text":"David in management awesome customer service. Thanks for making everything right on my daughters bday. Go Flagstaff.  Your the best!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would never in a million years have thought about putting Italian seasoning in guacamole. Nor would I have imagined cooking a cracker-thin pizza crust to use for dipping in said guacamole. But oh my Lord was that combination delicious! And the fact that we had more chunky guacamole than \"chips\" to dip with was quite the pleasant surprise. Where for $8 can you get an overflowing bowl of fresh, delicious guac other than here?

I also have to mention how adorable the place is. All the throwback decorations made the vibe really fun.

I cannot give this place full stars simply because of how uncomfortable the booths were. The seats really need to be replaced because everything is so warped that one person could be sitting a full six inches taller than another on the same bench. Same goes for the single person bathroom. I can't imagine coming here on a busy day with only one bathroom."}
{"text":"Great place for Italian food which doesn't just taste like food from a franchise restaurant! Whether you're in the mood for pizza, sandwich, salad or an amazing pasta dinner there's something here for you. Definitely one of my favorites!!!"}
{"text":"All the salads are huge! Can feed up to three people ! Love them all.... 
The outdoor seating is great! Love the peeps... everyone is so friendly! My favorite !"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday

Had a pretty good experience

Our server Melanie was great and made the long wait for our food bearable.

The portions here are huge and enough cheese to make any american happy :)

To top it off my friend got a free pizookie 

Great outside dining too"}
{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews but I just had to with this Oreganos, this was one of the worst experiences I had. First off, when the host sat me down at the table it wasn't even properly prepared and their were crumbs on the seat. Our server was great, she wasn't the problem, she could've checked on us more and communicated about the late food but other than that she was fine. 

I was just disappointed in the food I ordered. I ordered the garlic bread and a meatball sandwich.. the garlic bread had way too much garlic butter and the meatball sandwich bread was falling apart and it was the messiest Ive ever seen a restaurant sandwich, the meatballs were dry and not tasty at all. I ALWAYS get these two things at the old town location so I know what it's supposed to look and taste like. When I asked the manager why the meatball Sandwich was taking too long she said that the chefs put it in the oven to melt the cheese and the server put the order in later. Well I ordered both things at the same time and it was clear I didn't want them to come out so far apart. And to add the meatball sandwich took 20 minutes.. so after I was DONE the manager comes to the table DOES NOT EVEN STOP SHES STILL WALKING and says \"How is it tasting\" and I said fine and walks away. She sounded like she HAD to say that, didn't even sound genuine. At least pretend?! There was tension between the servers and the energy of the oreganos was quite disappointing and disturbing and the manager looked like she hated to be there."}
{"text":"Had deep dish pizza and a cesaer salad. Pizza very good salad was good but needed a little more dressing. You can't go wrong coming here. We are from Connecticut and have always had a good meal and service."}
{"text":"I called my order in at 422pm . and ai oredered an aunt margarita 18 in pizza. The girl on the phone verified that it was the university location and it will be ready in 25 min. I went to get my pizza. And they didnt have my order. Then they asked me to prove that i called. Showing the manager Eddie my phone. And he said he didnt have an order. I felt like i was being questioned and it felt uncomfortable. Didnt get an apology until the very end. Waited 55 min for the pizza. Didn't get a discount until we asked. I would not have given them my business however my friend was super hungry. Advice. Make sure you get the name of the phone order person. Not impressed with the pizza   ."}
{"text":"I moved to Phoenix about two months ago and have driven by a few Oregano's numerous times, wondering if it's any good. There's a location down the street from my work, so I decided to treat myself for lunch yesterday.
As soon as I walked in, a couple people at the front greeted me and took me to a table immediately. It was during the lunch rush so the place was close to full, but not packed. 
My server, Aryiel, came by right away for my drink order. I ordered a water and let her know I wanted to order the cheese deep dish pizza (I checked out the menu beforehand). She did let me know that the deep dish pizza takes about 40 minutes to cook, so I had to change my order because I only have an hour for lunch. I was bummed but appreciative that she gave me a heads up. She suggested the stuffed pizza lunch of the day which was sausage and pepperoni. I'm not a big sausage person but decided to give it a try since she said it would be ready much faster. I also ordered it with a side salad.
My water came right out, and within minutes, my salad followed. As soon as I finished the salad, my pizza came out and she cleared the salad plate. The manager came up as I was eating and asked how everything was and Aryiel also checked on me once or twice. 
I was only able to eat about half and took the rest to go. I had a coupon for a free Pizza Cookie (sign up for them email list and you get it right away) so I also ordered that to go, without the ice cream. 
Overall, I thought the food was delicious and I couldn't have asked for better service. I got a LOT of food for only $9 and change, so maybe lunch is the way to go price-wise."}
{"text":"Wow!  Loved the food, service and setting.  I was with a group of 9:  with wings, 2 pizzas, 2 sandwiches and 2 pizzookies, we were all stuffed and happy.  The beef sandwich was a definite staple that you must try."}
{"text":"Despite having tasty pizza, and excellent service once we were seated, my experience waiting to be seated was enough to warrant only three stars. 

First off, this restaurant doesn't accept reservations. Which is fine, but if you don't accept reservations and have a 40 minute wait time on a Tuesday evening you should probably provide some sort of seating for waiting guests. We were told to go wait at the bar. Which is a nice idea in theory. If you hadn't already filled the bar. There was standing room only to wait, and if I hadn't been there at the request of my sister I would have left rather than have to stand packed against other guests and in the way of servers. It was all in all a claustrophobic and uncomfortable experience. 

Once we were finally seated my mood improved. Our server went above and beyond and almost helped me forget the fire hazard I had just escaped from. The pizza was tasty, I have lived in Chicago and their \"stuffed crust\" or Chicago deep dish did not disappoint."}
{"text":"The staff at this location was friendly - plenty of smiles.

Our food took over an hour to arrive, though the restaurant was at about half capacity.  But we were warned that certain pizza selections would take about 45 minutes. 

When our pizza arrived, we were hungry enough to eat any type of pizza that was brought out. 

Unfortunately, even though it had been over an hour, we received a significantly uncooked pizza. Just above the moderately cooked bottom crust, the dough was very undercooked (doughy). The gummy dough was prominent in each bite. 

Things happen. We certainly understand this. But when we brought our undercooked pizza to the attention of the server, she spoke with the manager who sent the server back with instructions on how we could cook the rest of our pizza (over half remaining) at home.

We did not want or request a refund. However, we thought a cooked pizza was in order. 

I'm sure this had to be an isolated issue, but we were shocked that we were told how to cook the pizza, rather than the restaurant just doing that in the first place or offering to finish cooking our food. 

I believe most people go to a restaurant to have its kitchen staff prepare the food. We do make pizza at home, but it wasn't our intention when going to Oregano's.  

We still paid the full price, tipped the server but tossed the pizza. We'll likely go back, but to a classier location."}
{"text":"Big salad portion, enough to feed at least 3 people, as long as you order something else too. We had a pizza. Delicious!

We arrived about 11:10am, no wait and seated right away.

Excellent attentive service. Food is nice for the price too. We always come back, but NOT during peak lunch or dinner times.

The ambiance is pretty cool, lots of antiques and vintage items on display. The menus are repurposed record album covers that have been laminated. 

Good food at good prices! Quick & friendly service. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"FOOD: ok, but not \"oh, my-gosh I MUST come back to eat here ASAP\"...in fact, it seemed more bland & SUPER salty than I remember when I ate at an Oregano's years ago...

THIN CRUST PIZZA: like marinara & cheese on a giant cardboard cracker. Again, it was bland and very salty. Terrible!

PRICE: $11.95 for a 16\" pizza + $2 each xtra toppings...$5 bucks for a cheesy 1/2 baguette size garlic bread (cheesy and salty...maybe they use GARLIC SALT on this too).

PORTIONS: Generous.

SERVICE: Excellent!

DECOR: FUN and retro!

No wonder they give you HUGE Big-Gulp size cups of water, because you'll be so thirsty from all the salt consumption."}
{"text":"Called in a party of 15 over the phone. Originally, we were told that they could accommodate us. Showed up to here that they reserved a space for a future party, and that they couldn't accommodate us. Well... so much for \"first come first serve\" 

I get the drift.. they don't like Out of Towner's too much!!!"}
{"text":"super busy during lunch. would recommend only going with one other person so you can sit at the bar. 

their portions are huge and their prices are lower than you would expect. 

i had a veggie sandwhich thing. it was really good. and i saved half for another meal. 

one of the better places ive eaten since moving out here."}
{"text":"THIS review is for our visit on 11/9/2016, that I forgot to finish,    but remember it well cause we had great service from HALEE, she had a great smile and a great attitude which made our visit just wonderful.  this is the second time at this location, and just love the meatballs.   thanks for the good food and great service"}
{"text":"I have been to other location, and was excited for them to come to the west side, but i must say you have people at this location that just don't under stand what food service is all about.  we have been here twice now and I waited to review this location till they were open for a while, but i must tell get new help,  from the person who answered the phone to the last person we saw as we left, not a smile to be found.  Will visit other location like the one in Tempe, or on Scottsdale rd, but I don't think I will go back to this location. what a bummer. Especially since we have so many fewer place to go on the west side,  Just wish they could have done so much better, I wonder if it is the curse of the westside."}
{"text":"Well I must say we have had better then our visit on 7/13/17 it took us over an hour to get our food,  and when we got there there was only 3 to 4 tables in the restaurant.  it seemed like something was wrong because we had 3 people come to our table to say the food would be  shortly, so they did lose a star.

The other issue I have is when you order a large salad, and get nothing but lettuce, 2 slice of tomatoes, 2 onion ring slices and not enough dressing and then when you ask for more they charge you like fast food places do,   I could understand if you ask for an excessive amount but they only give you 1 serving of about 2 ounces for a very big salad.  its a shame that they are so stingy with the dressing when I could go to the other place and get a bottomless salad with as much dressing as I ask for."}
{"text":"Although chain places are not my favorites, when we are in Scottsdale it is nice to come to this location of oregano's since the location in Goodyear AZ is very unaccommodating even when they are slow.

Our server Lauren this evening was great she was very attentive to our needs, never let our drink get warm (HAHA).  Our order was taken promptly, but not to fast or pushy.  Food was served piping hot and was very tasty.   There side meatballs are a decent sizes for the prices, and are very flavorful."}
{"text":"This location usually has a wait during peak hours, but that is because it's tasty and worth the wait. I have never had anything that I didn't like. I have tried the Pablo Picasso Mexican salad, which has a really nice chipotle dressing. I have also had their artichoke dip, which is HUGE, and pretty good.

I think my favorite thing is their Italian Gold wings, it has a GREAT honey mustard sauce and there are never any stingy wings. Also great waffles fries. They have a ton of options for pizza styles too, I have never got one that I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"The food is always great here. I have been to many locations here in Phoenix and the food is consistent in every restaurant I've visited. When my family of 15 visited the 7th st and Camelback location for my niece's birthday we received the best service. Our waiter Kara, was kind, patient, and very tentative throughout our whole experience. I just wanted to make sure we gave her special Kudos because it was well deserved.

Besides the great service, all of our food was on point. We ordered wings, pasta, pizza, sandwiches, and appetizers. It was my grandmother's first time at this restaurant and she was very impressed with the food. We can't wait to visit again and try more great items off the menu.

Thank you to the team at Oreganos for the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I like this spot and their food is good except I went the other day and I ordered the side of fries and there was a piece of hair in it, and this is not the first time I hear about issues with them being clean. Something to look at for sure"}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS!!   My waitress was awesome! 
Will never go to Olive Garden again.   Not only was their thin crust pizza just taste bud popping good but their pasta was to die for.   Was so impressed!!  We god dessert too.   The restaurant is a bit small for being as packed as it was.   We did have a 45 min wait but was worth it.   We were so satisfied with our dishes and service from our waitress,  we gave a 30% tip.   We got 2 appetizers 2 pasta entres a 12\" pizza 2 drinks and cookie dough dessert.  Total bill was $78.   Great news for Military they have 20% discount.   So bill came to $65.     And yes it was just me and my husband and no we didn't eat everything lol!!   We sampled all the entres and had everything but dessert in to-go boxes =P\"     JFYI though..  Portions of the food are pretty big sizes.    Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Unlike the Oregano's out in Litchfield/Avondale,  bell and 67th Ave  was mediocre.   I gave 2 stars because my dad and husband stated their stuffed Chicago pizza was descent.   My Bistro thin crust was not.   It would have been a great pizza but  OMG I thought I was just chomping on salt tablets. I barely ate half a slice.   My husband about died from coughing because it was just so freaking salty.   Even the Pacific Ocean doesn't have that much salt (duh this is exaggerated for those of you who get so f*cking technical) but that's what it felt like to me.   I had no appetite after that so I had them take it away and just sat there.  Won't be going back..  Id rather go to #1 brothers."}
{"text":"The food is still enjoyable but their decision to use an app instead of taking phone call ahead is woeful because Nowait is hopeless. It told me the wait was 15 minutes so I Ieft the house. Upon arrival I'm told \"oh the app is optimistic\", and since then it updated from 15 to 45 minutes.

Change the app!"}
{"text":"Before I mention anything about the food, let's discuss the staff. They are so full of personality that they were like trained bubbly androids lol Really though, they were very nice and seemed genuinely happy that you came to dine there. The pizza was great too. Had a thin crust veggie pizza (don't ask me which one - I forgot because I was busy guzzling it down). Being from out of town, I can't say if the crowd is always like it was, but it was very crowded when we went. And that usually spells great food. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I went to this Oregano's a few days ago and had Rhiley as my server. It was an amazing experience, the food came out quickly and tasted delicious, our drinks
were always full and our server always had a smile on her face! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The owners of Oregano's should be consultants in how to run a pizza+ place.  As soon as a new location is opened it instantly is busy.  While most businesses fail in the first couple years,  they have to be profitable very quickly.

So, what's the secret?   The design of each restaurant is somewhat eclectic.   Most other pizza  places are some version of  a  cookie  cutter. Not so with Oregano's.  That is great, but that is not THE secret.

The elusive secret is the great food, prepared correctly every time in a reasonable time by people who really look like they like their jobs.   

Sad to say this seems to be unusual these days.  It ain't rocket science folks,  although it appears to be the exception rather than the rule.

Follow their formula and you might have success like they have earned. 

BTW.  Unless you are lucky, you will have a wait.  It's well worth it, however."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food as usual.  The manager came over and took the time to meet and greet.  Thanks for being #RedforEd supportive too!"}
{"text":"Food is very good here service is great me and my family love coming here! Affordable price's clean and service is great.  Me and my family are on our way to eat dinner there right now!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from San Diego, and we're visiting our Son and Daughter in law here in Chandler. Our kids suggested Oregano's, and we thought it would be an okay place to eat. 
IT WAS OUTRAGEOUSLY FANTASTIC !

I wish this restaurant was in San Diego, because I would eat here at least once a week. 

Try the Roasted Chicken Lasagna. It's so good, I have no more words... Boom!"}
{"text":"It wasn't to busy when we were dining here but our waiter wasn't to attentive which kinda sucked.. had to flag him down to get refills on our drink .."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in the Chandler area so far. The sauce is good, the crust is thin, and the toppings seem very fresh. We've also had other items on the menu and they were all very good as well."}
{"text":"We have been regulars since this location opened. Expect a long wait to get in, even in off season on a week night. Service has been inconsistent. Once finally seated, we ordered 2 small 12 inch thin crust pizzas and waited almost 40 minutes. The pizza was good but since we had a commitment that required us to leave within about 75 minutes of arrival, we had to immediately request to-go boxes and our bill. We were told that it takes 30 minutes to make a thin crust pizza. I have ordered many pizzas before and have never heard it to take this long. On our last visit prior, they burned my pizza and had to start all over. That time it only took 7 minutes to replace. On another previous visit, the bar tip I wrote on my receipt was for $8. Weeks later I saw on my debit card that the purchase was rung through for much higher. I love Oreganos, I love the atmosphere but can no longer handle their poor service. My bill for 2 small pizzas and 2 rail drinks was $58, before tip. Hard to justify almost $70 for casual dining. Good-bye Oregano's, I will miss all the good things about you. It is a love-hate relationship and I am cutting my ties."}
{"text":"The food and service are phenomenal... Not to mention their pizza cookie deserves the noble peace prize!  The kitchen is very accommodating to requests and special orders which makes Oreganos even more amazing!"}
{"text":"I could write a big long review and list every detail, but let me just give it to you straight and simple...

Best wings
Excellent pasta
Great Pizza
Amazing Garlic bread
Great sandwiches 
Ridiculous Service! (in a good way!)

What more could you really ask for???

I would drive all the way from Cali to have some of this stuff again! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Shitty service, manager not helpful at all. Waited around for my order for lasagna for over 40 min to find out they never put the order in. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"If you're looking for larger than life portions and looking to Carb load as much as Michael Phelps, Oregano's is your place!

It's been a year since my move here and have gone without trying Oregano's despite the frequent mentions of this bistro. Came here for the first time and got recommendations from Yelp, since they serve a variety of salads, pizza and pastas. 

I decided to go with the Stuffed Riga Tony and a Passionfruit Tea. The pasta was penne stuffed with cheese and covered with a meat sauce. Definitely filling and held about 2-3 portions in itself. The Passionfruit Tea was refreshing and comes unsweetened. Tried the Zainy Ziti and the Lady is a Scampi from others in my party and they tasted similar in taste, but differed in spice.

Service was great. Pasta is typical of Olive Garden, Maggiano's or the like. Food isn't mind-blowing good, just great in terms of price for proportion. Perhaps the pizza is better? Great place for large groups however and if you're looking to save a bit of money on food."}
{"text":"After our previously horrible experience with a specific server, I contacted customer service. They graciously gave us a gift card for our next visit. The service has been good the last few visits. The food is great, but that was never my complaint."}
{"text":"Back in 2009 I had a *terrible* experience and complained on here and to them. They gave us a gift card for our next visit. Every time we have been back to the restaurant (maybe 2-4 times a year) the has been completely *amazing* so much so that I wonder if they have a photo of me on their wall somewhere. The food is all great as well!"}
{"text":"Food was decent.  Had the thin crust pizza wife had the chicken parmigiana.   Margarita was better. Place was really small causing long wait."}
{"text":"It's become a must now to come to Oregano's Pizza Bistro whenever I travel to Arizona. The pizza, the wedding soup, the cheese bread, and the wings(!) are absolutely amazing. My mouth is watering just by thinking bout the gold medium gold wings, one of the best wings I have tasted thus far. Aside from the amazing food, service is always great here. Genuine friendly servers and service is fairly quick. 
  Can't wait to come back here . :)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. The food is delicious. I only gave it 3 stars due to the size of the place...it's tiny! That also means it is very loud. The bar is small as well, only offering 4 bar stools. I decided to have lunch at the bar and had to deal with the constant traffic of people squeezing through the bar stools to order drinks, before getting to their dining table.
Other than that, The Diablo Shrimp plate is divine... the spiciest thing on the menu (not spicy enough for me, however). Kinder, the bartender was attentive and friendly, even with the constant flow of people wanting drinks.
A good place to stop, if only for a delicious plate of pasta."}
{"text":"mini chicken pesto pizza for lunch is to die for! may look small but will be enough for two people! the cookie is amazing to!"}

I came here today for lunch and was served by a gentleman by the name of Robert."}
{"text":"First off let me tell you about the take out girls. Madison is my favorite. 

I hate pickles , with a passion! I will not even eat something if it shares a plate with a pickle. I love oreganos but a majority of the time they kept putting the pickle on the side of my big chicken parm. I would ask 5 or 6 times no pickle and they just keep doing. So I fell out of love with oregnos as a brand. When this location open up by my house , I decided to give it a second chance! 

I am happy I did. Those girls never ever put pickles in. They always make sure it's not there. One time a new girl did and Madison had them remake the sandwich and gave me a discount on it for the extra wait. Now I got at least 5 or 6 times a month. To the point they know my voice and memorized my order. If your looking for a place to eat at that cares about you as a person and your pickiness. This is the place. 

Madison is also a rockstar that girl deserves a hug and high five!"}
{"text":"I'm completely in love with this place my husband and I go at least 2-3 times a month for the past 3 years they best food ever the best portions especially the pizza cookie great service as always never had a bad experience at oregano I love them"}
{"text":"We are seated at the bar. You can order full meals and not wait to be seated. I had already put our names in w/ the host then sat at the bar, I was told 45-60 minute wait for a table. My name was called 25 minutes later. On the appetizer menu you can order 2 meatballs or sausage. We asked for 1 of each since this is our first time here. Bartender told us no, weird. So my husband asked what's the difference if you're still getting 2 items? He went and asked a manager and came back to tell us no, this is not allowed. Ahhh, I yearn for the good customer service days. We ordered the calamari which is ok, I prefer the rings/tentacles vs the long strips. We also got a house salad. It could easily feed 4 people, I saw lots of salad being thrown away. I got the lasagna appeared to have no noodles which was really odd. The dish was very flavorful and seasoned well. I had a side of meatballs, they are average. I'm partial to Il Capo in Scottsdale meatballs. The deep dish, and I quote my husband, it's a Lou Malnati's wannabe. It's fine but there's better out there. The fly fans are a bit annoying when at the bar. They make your food cold almost instantly. I understand they are necessary but I saw 3 ladies ask if they can be turned down. We will come again because it's close and there aren't many options here. Save the lettuce industry, make smaller salads!!!"}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering To-Go Food from this place.  Called this place at 5:25 pm and the soonest to pick up was 7:20 pm because of catering.  Not very well organized for take out.  I would hate to walk in to the place and sit down for dinner.  Would you have to wait until 7:20???  Don't waste your time with this place..."}
{"text":"The pizza was good at one time...... what happened? 
This is the saltiest stuff I ever ate.............did the chef change about 8 years ago....  and show up with nothing more than a salt shaker..... the only thing you taste is salt......... I know it is the sauce.... so everything must be this salty.........maybe that cookie is good..... Is that salty too?????
definitely pass on this one...... yuck......."}
{"text":"I moved to Mesa from Chicago about a year ago and I miss foods from home, especially pizza! We decided to try this place since it boasted \"Chicago style\" pizza. We of course ordered the stuffed pizza with sausage and roasted garlic. The atmosphere was great and the sangria was going down smooth. Then the pizza came... OMG!!! If I closed my eyes, I could swear I was back home. The sausage had a familiar taste and the ooey gooey cheesy goodness was heavenly! Crust was nice and crisp on the bottom. You can also sign up for their club and it gives you a free cookie dessert(which we took to go as we were Full!). The wait staff was wonderful too! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After dealing with years of crazed hype from family and friends alike, I finally caved a few weeks ago and grabbed a bite at Oregano's. Not a super huge lover of Italian, but this place may end up being a prime mover in changing my mind.

Grabbed a pretty late dinner with a few high school friends I hadn't seen in a while, and we had the place virtually to ourselves. Parsing through the menu, I could hear my mom's almost manic raving about their pizzas and quickly decided to go the way of pasta (sorry, mom). I shamelessly love quirky campy menu listings, so I was super pleased with the Alfredo the Dark for the quick chuckle and the spot-on quality. The kick of poblano went a long way in cementing this as easily one of my favorite pasta dishes in Phoenix. Chased this all down with a Manhattan and a heaping helping of Pizzookie.

Super solid meal overall. Finally starting to understand the rave reviews. Maybe next time I'll actually grab a slice."}
{"text":"Some places yell \"Welcome to Cold Stone!!\" at you every time you walk through the door (not to point fingers), and Jesus, can that grate on your nerves a little bit. At this joint, they must have mercifully suggested to employees to just be friendly. Walking through the restaurant for a little pre-meal recon, nearly everyone we passed said hey or asked how it was going, so you felt surrounded by really nice folks instead of obnoxious corporate drones. Hell of a first impression. It's a good thing too, because there's a sign just inside the door boldly proclaiming that some website poll rated them best in town in about 11 different categories like \"pizza,\" \"Italian,\" \"worth the wait,\" and such, so the bar had been set pretty high.

One good question is why more popular restaurants don't have a spot where you can comfortably spend the half-hour that you wait for a table getting shellacked on a patio? Good move, Oregano's. Bartenders were omnipresent and eager to please. $12 for a pitcher of Kiltlifter is just, and under $5 for a glass of wine is approaching dangerous. 

Prepare for challenges upon being seated as the menu is just about as gargantuan as the portions (and the portions are colossal). Pizza is the signature, and you have some options. Who outside of Illinois knew that there is a Chicago-style thin crust pie? The bane of lousy pizzerias is the inability to make a fully cooked thin crust without turning it into a cracker, but these guys pulled it off. Plus Poblano peppers added some welcome zest. It didn't live up to an 11-category sweep, but it was pretty good pie. If you have any calzone fans in attendance, the O-zone is crafted from a rolled-up 18\" pie and it's pretty much otherworldly if you like stuffing pounds of cheese into your face. It's so thick that it takes 45 minutes to cook, but if you came to Oregano's, you probably weren't pressed for time to begin with, so whatever. We also dug into the Mexican-themed Pablo Picasso Salad which was literally enough food for three people. Normally, I could do without salad and especially one not shamelessly smothered in dressing, but this one actually has enough flavor on its own merits that it's not just a vessel for ranch. Capping off a totally gluttonous food orgy, the pizookie dessert was giant cookie half-baked in a little deep dish then covered in ice cream, which pretty much speaks for itself.

All in all, Oregano's served up a fine meal experience. The service was more or less astounding, portions are enormous, prices aren't out of control, and the place had a pretty cool layout and vibe. Though better than just passable, the pizza didn't knock my socks off, but maybe that's what you get for foregoing deep dish at a Chicago pizzeria. So I'd look elsewhere if you're in a rush or on a diet, but otherwise it's certainly a worthwhile place at which to gorge yourself."}
{"text":"Come to Papa!
Anyone who has lived in AZ for any length of time has been here....several times. Casual, fun, great food...what else do you need? Go with friends and sit outside (unless its July). Find a parking spot. Put your name on the waiting list. Relax. Enjoy a beer on tap. Relax. Enjoy another beer. Order one of their outstanding creations....and another beer. Go home. Repeat next weekend."}
{"text":"I have frequented many Oregano locations in the valley.  Stopped by for cocktail and pizza at the Gilbert location.  Sat at the bar and wanted to enjoy our drink and talk about our day.  Pizza was pretty good but the noise level was very annoying.  There was a family sitting at a table in the bar with a 2 year old that screamed the whole time we were there.  The 2 very young hostesses were just as annoying.  They decided to play some stupid cup game at the hostess desk that was competing with the screaming child.  Never will I go to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Wow, so the food here is pretty good, but the wait is silly.  I mean it, silly.  We ordered a pizza and the waiter immediately asked us if we knew it was at least 45 minutes for a thin crust and an hour for a deep dish?  Huh?  What in the name of God takes that long to assemble a pizza?  I can *almost* understand the long wait on a deep dish simply because of the cooking time, almost.  But 45 minutes for a thin crust (we're talking a crust so thin it's almost like a huge circular Saltine cracker) is friggen ridiculous.  Sorry, Oregano's, but that is just too long.

So rant about the ridiculous wait time aside, the food here is actually pretty good, and they can make a side of calamari like nobody's business.  It's delicious.  My toddler and I mowed through a serving of calamari and had enough to take home to snack on the next night.  I also had a mojito and it was very good, crisp, refreshing and yummy.  And as far as the pizza goes it was very good, and my husband throughly enjoyed it.  It was just the right amount of cheese and the crust was perfect.  Good pizza, awful wait.   

Like my last sit-down dining experience this waiter also somehow managed to completely ignore the presense of my toddler and I finally had to ask him to get us a cup of water for her.  Rant Alert!  I seriously do NOT understand why wait staff ignore the babies and small children of paying patrons.  Yes, it's true that my two year old won't be tipping you, or placing a food order, or even mentioning her experience on Yelp, but her mommy sure as hell will, so at least acknowledge that when you take drink orders every living, breathing human being at the table probably needs their own beverage and may need to order their own food too. 

Knowing the wait on the pizza I got clever and called over our waiter and asked him to put in an order for a pizzokie (sp?) for us, to go.  I explained that I couldn't make my toddler behave much longer and he graciously told me that he didn't mind noisy babies, which was great, except I bet all the patrons around us WOULD mind it if my daughter decided she was done being nice and was ready to start banging the salt shaker on the table while bellowing out 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' at the stop of her tiny lungs.  ;)  So after some puzzlement at my (apparently odd) request to take dessert to go he finally got it sorted out and we were able to pay and leave with our delicious dessert before the impending meltdown.

So all in all this was a nice visit, but that wait time on the pizza needs to be shortened.  Seriously!"}
{"text":"I went with the Balenie, Pablo Picasso salad, and the big rig!! Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Pizza is a staple, and its always good to find places where your craving can be satisfied. Oreganos is one of those places. Salads and pizzas are both delicious. I am partial to thin crust and their's hit the spot. I also tried a bit of chicago style- meh, its good, but I just don't get the whole deep dish thing in general. Complete your meal with the pizza cookie concoction - you will go into a sugar coma but it tastes so good going down. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. That being said the service at this location is amazing. Our server Anthony Palermo was on point the whole time. He forgot a kids slice of pizza but had it up in 2 minutes flat. Then Gave the table a free cookie for the unnoticeable mix up. I will defiantly be coming back on his service alone."}
{"text":"This was the first time for me going here and I will tell you, if you are really hungry..this is the place to come.  The servings are huge, the food is good, the service was outstanding and they play old Ozzie and Harriet shows on the little tv's around the place.  I am still eating on my calzone a day later and still have more to go.  Must stop"}
{"text":"When I first moved here, Oregano's was my go to place! And then things changed!! They became commercialized. Their wings are small with less meat and pasta seems to be made out of a bag! I still will go there for their pizza cookie but other than that I like to stay away from Oregano's!"}
{"text":"It's Oreganos. Not much more needs to be said.

The food is always consistent, as is the wait. But hey, it's good food with fantastically large portion sizes at decent prices. Super great for a casual date night or to take the whole family.
My first few times in I didn't venture too far from the Pizza but now that I have been so many times, their pasta is delicious along with their lasagnas and sandwiches.
All in all, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Oregano's is an awesome place to grab a pizza or a pizookie if you just want some dessert. I have always had pretty good service, never had major issues with food or staff. As most people have pointed out, the wait is pretty much the only issue. I'm not a huge fan of the whole not taking reservations concept. A few restaurant's in the area have adopted that and it doesn't sit quite well with me. But with how busy this location is, revenue isn't an issue. Quality food, decently priced. Can't get much better than that."}
{"text":"All the other locations I've been to are awesome with great smiling service. This is the worst location I've been to. Literally only 1 worker smiled and the food was not very good. Not sure how or why my lasagna noodles came out brown but it also didn't taste fresh. When we asked the server he said it comes out like that after going through the oven. Umm I've made homemade lasagna as well as frozen and never had the noodles come out brown. Paid way too much for food I didn't even eat."}
{"text":"Had dinner hear last night with my family everything was great we will be back thank you for the great food and service!!!!!"}
{"text":"The pan pizza is exellent!! appetizers are delish, as the dessert and drinks. The only negative is the wait time if you choose to eat at the restaurant. no reservations! oh and staff is overly friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"My Friend Took Me Here After His Boyfriend Took Him There On A Date, And Let Me Tell You...AWESOME!

Amazing Service, Amazing Pizza and Wings...I Would And Will Take Anyone Visiting Out Of Town To Eat And Drink Here....Plus The Set Up To This Place Is Amazing In Itself, And What A Good Atmosphere...Which Is Sometimes Hard To Find Here, I Felt Like I Was Eating Out Of Town Or Something"}
{"text":"We never ate at this restaurant but I always pass by it so we decided to try it and was great food and service. Our waiters name was Josh fabulous waiter. It gets pretty busy and but it's worth the wait. It's hard to find good restaurants and good service all in the same sentence. I guess it depends on the restaurant.  

I had the baked ziti so if you can't eat much I suggest sharing with a friend or I guess it depends how hungry you are. Oh yeah the deserts are also fabulous we ordered the cookie ice cream half chocolate chip and the half peanut butter with vanilla ice cream omg that's so good. Share with friends for sure !!! Excellent food for sure. We went to the one in Glendale."}
{"text":"I have gone to Oregano's a number of times and I was not impressed by their pasta, but their pizza is worth the visit! I've tried a number of pasta dishes that were all big in portion size, but left me unsatisfied when it comes to flavor. I love, love, love their kickbutt garlic bread appetizer with cheese and marinara sauce. It was the perfect start to the meal and it was like 2 feet long! The best thing I have had here by far is the numero one-o Chicago style deep dish pizza. It took a while to make but we knew what we were getting into. It was so huge that we could each only eat one piece! We substituted mushrooms for jalapenos and it was the best choice ever because that transformed our pizza into a spicy treasure. We were both surprised at the kick (which we loved) that came with these red jalapenos. I had a bloody mary, which was decent, and Eric got a margarita that he enjoyed. The service is top-notch with our server constantly checking on us and apologizing for the wait for our pizza. The deep dish is extremely huge and took a lot longer than the other dishes that you can order, so be aware that the wait is inevitable and be patient!"}
{"text":"I eat at oregano's at least once a week but this one was amazing . We used the yelp waitlist and the estimated time was incorrect . Informed Ralph (manager) and he let us be seated right away and our food came out very fast .  Nikki was one of the sweetest waitresses i have had especially since we were placed in her area with food order already taken ."}
{"text":"Had a blast, Patrick was our server A+++ service from him!!!

I highly recommend asking for him as your server. The wings, calamari, thin crust pizza & shrimp salad was just great!

I will be coming back again to this Oreganos. The ambiance is family friendly and as I always say; if the service is great then it's  worth spending your time and $$$ with that restaurant."}
{"text":"I usually love coming here and the customer service is always awesome. 

However, the last time I went I ordered a large Beefstro salad and a large Pablo Picasso salad for my girlfriend and between the both there was maybe 2 oz of meat. 

I would have said something but if you've ever ordered the big beefstro salad or the pablo picasso, you know you have to search throughout the salad leaves for meat and usually you find your fair share. By the time I consumed half the salad, I was too stuffed on iceberg lettuce to care.
Same thing with my gf (she got the small salad).

Probably will take a break from this place..."}
{"text":"Service: 5 stars. 
Food: two 5 star dishes, one 1 star dish. 

Oregano's is one of my favorite spots. Every time I visit home, I always try to visit; lots of fun memories and happy meals associated with this restaurant chain. This time, I got to bring my parents to the Gilbert location. 

They loved the cozy feel. The wait staff was as fantastic as my previous experiences. We were told there would be a wait - but was seated much quicker. 

We ordered a calamari appetizer, which was tasty and arrived quickly. My parents had the Alfredo the Dark and the El Diablo Shrimp Pasta, both of which were as delicious as I remembered. Hi My pesto penne bake however was deeply disappointing. 

I ordered it with sausage, but could find none in the bake. (The waiter definitely requested it; unsure if the kitchen forgot or was just incredibly stingy in putting any in.) The pesto penne was also fairly light on pesto. The whole new was capped with a coagulated lump of cheese on top, resulting in a dry, bland pasta. This was a far cry from the times I've had it in the past. 

Most egregious however was the bread bowl. It literally was unbreakable with the fork, finally shattering when I tried to snap a piece off. Hardened to the point of appearing stale, it was completely inedible. 

My parents enjoyed their meals, and again, the service was attentive and great. I guess I'll be staying away from the baked pastas, and hope this was an anomaly in an otherwise good history of eating here."}
{"text":"This Oregano's is so, so, so much better than the Tempe one! Why? Because there is parking and you won't have to worry about your car being towed while you eat dinner!  I think the common consensus among most everyone is that Oregano's is fabulous. It's fun, the food is really good and the servers are always friendly and fast. The pizza cookie is pretty much famous and for those who haven't been recently, peanut butter is now one of the options- and it's delish. I usually split a pizza when I come and it's always good, but the big rig pasta is really tasty too.  Just make sure you have two to three hours to spend at dinner, because Oregano's will never be an in and out joint.  There is almost always a long wait, no matter what day or time it is and the food just takes awhile to cook. But don't worry, it's always worth it."}
{"text":"Passed by the location in Cave Creek and marveled at how ridiculously packed the place was on a Tuesday night.  Later during the week my girlfriend and I decided to try the location in Glendale.

We arrived and were informed that there was a 45 minutes wait.  I began to get antsy and suggested go somewhere else.  About 10 minutes in, I decided to grab a fortune cookie and see if the message inside would help on that decision.  Yes, a fortune cookie at an Italian eatery.  Strange I know.  So, the fortune read something along the lines of great things come to those who are patient.  We were called immediately after that to be seated.

Our server was fabulous.  He was friendly, attentive and offered insight into many of the offered dishes.  We settled on a Cheesey Garlic Bread appetizer and a Deep Dish pizza with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, black olives and onions.  We were informed that the deep dish would take about 40 minutes to cook.  We mulled the idea over and decided what the heck.  In the mean time our ice cold adult beverages arrived and soon after the Cheesey Garlic Bread.  OMG.  If the pizza was anything like the garlic bread, we were in for a treat.  Each and every bit of bread each of us \"oooh'ed and ahhhh'ed\" at how great it was.  So much so that we ordered another.  Yeah, next time - not to self - save room for PIZZA!  

The Deep Dish Delightfulness showed up.  Our server added fresh grated parmesan cheese and we then proceeded to dig in.   My mouth is salivating at the thought as I type this.  Absolutely, hands down the best pizza I have ever had.  I was born and reared in the Southwest and have never had the opportunity to have Chicago or NY style pizza in that region of the country.   So my experience has been limited.   HOWEVER, I firmly believe that this deep dish goodness would be hard to beat by anyone!  What an amazing choice!  Do not hesitate!  Unfortunately we both ate so much garlic bread, we were able to only eat one slice each of pizza.  We were both so happily stuffed.  We were in pain but smiling.

Then the silly question of dessert is asked...  I am not huge on sweets, however, my girlfriend was really wanting the cookie and ice cream dessert.  So after debate, we decided to take 1/2 chocolate chip and 1/2 macadamia nut TO GO.  Needless to say we both were so tempted we had to try it.  Big mistake.  It never made it off the table and only found a ride home in our stomach.  Amazing dessert to top off an amazing meal.

I don't live in Phoenix, but visit regularly.   I will be back in a few short weeks and I am literally counting down the days to frequent this eatery once again!"}
{"text":"For my second to last day of vacation here in Phoenix, I decided to try this place for lunch and let me tell you, this is a must visit to this place. I had the lunch portion of the Alfredo in the Dark pasta and it was filling. I wouldn't dare to order the dinner portion for lunch unless you are REALLY hungry. I highly recommend this place when visiting or living in Phoenix.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. They are excellent with their service and great waitstaff."}
{"text":"LOVE Oregano's! They have delicious pizza, pasta, salads, wings, everything. The portions are huge and the prices are right and I can honestly say I've never not left Oregano's full and satisfied! Plus the atmosphere is fun as well. If you've saved room after your meal, try the pizookie, it's amazing. Giving 4 stars because there is always a huge wait and they don't take reservations or seat you until everyone is there, and also because the deep dish pizza was far too cheesy and saucy when I tried it (more than a deep dish should be) but everything else is superb."}
{"text":"Oregano's is always a great choice from the tasty pasta dishes to their excellent pizzas and salads. Food arrives hot and in a timely manner. Wait staff is professional and friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently great.  Pizza, pasta and salads are all great menu choices.  Wait staff is attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere has a retro feel and the seating is comfortable.  Don't miss this Italian gem."}
{"text":"We often order Oregano's to go for lunch for our staff, and usually we have this happen at unknown times and it is not planned as we never know what our days will bring us at work. We give this Oregano's a call right after they open and end up placing a large surprise order for lunch, and they always accommodate and work hard to get us taken care of quickly and efficiently. Their food is always up to par, and they give us everything we need to go with it including extra sauces, utensils, etc. It is nice to know we can count on them on the drop of a dime to take care of our staff's lunch on a busy day and they make it so easy. We always order some pizzas, salads, wings, pastas, and desserts, and everything is fresh and tastes great! The staff helps load everything into the car even! Thank you Oregano's To-Go staff for always helping us out! =)"}
{"text":"Looking for Pizza tonight.  We are in town for a Golf week.   We ordered the thin crust 101 and a Chicago style thick crust.  Neither disappointed.  Preferred the thin crust \"special\" but both were good.  Recommend Oregano's.   Thank goodness we have left overs."}

Excellent food down to the ranch dressing ! 
Cute and fun atmosphere,really loved this place!"}

{"text":"I got the original veggie wedgie. I don't like the tasted of the veggies inside the sandwich. The sweet potatoes fries also not so good, very soft. I like their customer service though, very friendly."}
{"text":"I grew up going to Oreganos with my dad on our annual trips to Tempe and now, every time I visit AZ, I ALWAYS get dinner here... sometimes twice. Always the same order: cheese pizza and a classic pizzookie. Really really fun atmosphere and consistently kind staff and good food. Can't wait to be back in AZ for another weekend of Oreganos."}
{"text":"the restaurant is ok.. the music was too loud for me and i just am not a fan of the flavors they have in the food. The employees are all nice and do their job well. I have heard lots of good about it however , so i say try it for yourself and decide."}
{"text":"A fun atmosphere and cheerful, attentive service, but holy cow, the SALT!!!!!  I ordered the eggplant parmigiana and it was so insanely loaded with salt, it was quite literally inedible.  The server was good about removing it from the bill, and I hope the kitchen was advised of the issue.
Seriously, it was as if the salt shaker had dropped into the pot of sauce, and they just shrugged and served it anyway. My companion tasted it, and agreed...so it wasn't just me!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Pizza cookie? wings? stuffed sandwiches? pizza? I love Oregano's and it loves me. You should go. It will love you too. (But be prepared to wait on a Fri or Sat night! Very busy)."}
{"text":"Wow.  Great thin crust pizza.  Cold beer and the app of thin crust and  guacamole was out of this world.  Loved the atmosphere and staff.  This will be our new go to when we visit!"}
{"text":"Opened tuesday , I went with my family last night. It was packed but worth it. As opposed to driving to scottsdale like we normally would , this is very convenient. We ordered the bbq chicken pan 12 inch. Our drinks never went below half full , attentive service! Friendly. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's this location in the heart of Tempe is ALWAYS busy. The food is delicious. Service is hit or miss...servers often spend more time flirting with each other than attending to your table. Welcome to a \"college town\". Nonetheless, always a good option for lunch or dinner. The menu has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Ah best food! Pizza is amazing, salads are to die for and dessert is heavenly! Love the friendly and chill enviorment! Have never ordered anything I did not like!"}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.
My husband and I just moved here three days ago. We were exhausted after a long day of unpacking and organizing our new home. We decided to go out for a bite to eat.
We sat at the bar. The waitress, Alexis, was friendly when we first arrived but soon we realized that her other customers were more important. It seemed like ages before she came and took our food order.
The food seemed to take forever to arrive. I ordered the Sproccoli (Which I had just had five days prior at Oreganos in Flagstaff). I loved this pizza because it had no tomato sauce on it. To my surprise, my pizza arrived smothered in tomato sauce that was extreme peppery and hot with cheese covering the veggies in the center of my pizza. When I asked the waitress, ALexis, if this was a mistake  as I have had this pizza before and it had no tomato sauce, her response was.... \"Yes it does if you read the menu!!!!\" (I read the menu again and there was no mention of tomato sauce)!!! She offered to have my pizza redone, I refused as we had such a long wait and I could not bear to have to wait another 30 mins. I observed her offering all the other customers extra cheese with their meal. She seemed to ignore me and never offered me any extra cheese.
I am rather disappointed in the quality, and wait time from the time our food was ordered.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Guacatoni.. hummmm  The best..
Can be a little noisy and gets crowded early, but worth the wait (within reason).
Service is very tentative and right there without being in the way.  can be a little rushed, so tell your staff you want a relaxed pace meal and they will go easy.

large portions to share or left overs for sure.  order appropriately.

will be back... often.."}
{"text":"We come for pizza but stay for the pizza cookie. This place is always busy but we found the best time to go for lunch is around 11:30 and dinner you need to get there by 5 to avoid waiting. Everyone in my family likes something different. Here are our favorites: Oreganos Favorite Salad, Italian Gold Wings, Chicago Italian Sausage Sandwich, pepperoni thin crust pizza. Their midday rush menu is great. My coworker & I split the Heck A slice and salad, it's perfect for two when you get it to go. The heck a sliced is really 2 huge slices. Laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere + great food means you will almost always have to wait for a seat... But the wait is worth it!  Wedding soup, wings of fire, a heck of a slice, and a daily deep dish special... The list of special selections just keeps going.  My pick?  Try the \"Big Rig\" (which might be best if shared) and save some room for the best pizzookie you can find!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I visited here for Valentine's day lunch after a long break - 1+ year.  We've always had good service in the past visits and this visit was no different.  We've come here for lunch and dinner, by ourselves, and with family.

The lunch deals from 11am to 3pm Monday through Friday are a great value.  You'll still get massive portions at a fraction of the dinner price but the lunch items are limited.  The lunch items do come out fairly quickly if you are limited on time.  The wait to be seated for lunch is very short to non-existent from previous experience.  The dinner wait can be excruciatingly long as other posts mentioned.  Come early if you can to lessen the stress.

I ended up ordering their \"heckuva\" slice of pizza and calamari.  Hubby did his usual \"bowl-o-pasta\".  The slice of pizza is actually 2 big slices and is very similarly sized as the Costco slice of pizza.  Big difference is that this is the thin style while Costco is hand-tossed.  1 slice is more than plenty for me and I always end up taking the second slice home for later.  The calamari is all big steak pieces; nicely breaded and seasoned.  I prefer rings in my calamari apps but this version is still good enough for me to order regularly.

Hubby ordered 2 rounds of the bowl-o-pasta.  Each bowl must have 1.5 pounds of pasta and sauce, no joke.  1 bowl would be enough to fill most people.  Hubby was probably a competitive eater in his past life as he tends to eat A LOT while at restaurants.  I did sneak in a bite and I found it to be average.  I'm sure a lot of people can make this pasta at home and no one would know the difference.  Not something I would ever order for myself but hubby really likes it.

Overall, this is a great place for date night and to have a meal with your family.  As long as this place is still here, we'll find our way back to it."}
{"text":"Growing up an hour in traffic away from Chicago makes you a harsh pizza critic. Honestly it was lackluster deep dish. My brother literally said it tasted like we could have made it at home. Nothing special, sparsely topped and bland, not like rosatis out here or anywhere in chitown."}
{"text":"Gosh. I don't know how I've never been here before. The food is just outstanding. I had the salad with thin beef slices and it was a salad like no other. The dressing was nicely mixed in and with the perfect level of spiciness. The wings were also delectable. The waitress was nice. Environment also nice."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly staff.

Italian gold wings = very tasty!

The big beefstro salad was good. It wasnt as good as the past two times I've had it... Not sure if the sauce was different. But the beef was still nicely thinly sliced and warm and felt like a meal.

The stuffed rigatoni was delicious. Perfect mild spice. Decent portion. Enough sauce to just cover the noodles. 

Bathrooms were mehh."}
{"text":"Great service and incredible food.  I travel a good deal and always look for non-chain places to eat.  This is a small chain, but the service was probably the best I have seen in 6 months. 

Food was plentiful and fresh.  Also a great selection of wines to choose from.

Will be back on my next visit to PHX."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy oregano's but the last two times I went were awful! My server seemed like I was unwelcome and made me feel very rushed, never offered to refill my drink tried twice to take my plate while I was mid bite and said \"are you don't yet, do you want this wrapped\" when I wasn't even half way through my meal. Got my order wrong and when I told him it was incorrect he asked me what I wanted him to do about it. Hopefully next time is better I was stuck with the same server both times and both times were awful. Some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced I don't think he could cut it working at SevenEleven let alone sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"We were greeted with a friendly face and accommodating service. We got to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful Phoenix weather. The outdoor seating was spacious, clean, and well-lit during the evening. 

We shared the Pesto Penne Bake and a House Salad. All of which were delicious. The Penne Bake came in a large bread bowl. It was filled with pesto covered penne, tomato, basil, and topped with mozzarella cheese and sundried tomatoes. Between the two of us, we were stuffed and nearly finished it! We also asked for a side of marinara for dipping the bread bowl. 
The house salad wasn't anything special, but good appetizer before such a carb loaded entree. 

Our company had a 16\" thin crust pizza. They ate nearly all of it between the two of them and the next morning, had the leftovers. I'm assuming that they wholeheartedly enjoyed the pizza.

It took me a long time to get to Oregano's since it's a chain, but I'm glad I finally did get to try it! It's definitely a cool place, especially for large groups. The food is very reasonably priced with LARGE portions. It is also very vegetarian (but NOT vegan) friendly which greatly surprises me!  I really want to come back and try their deep dish pizza!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give it 3 stars because I really loved the food, but the service was just too terrible. Any other restaurant would have gotten a 1, honestly. 

I visited my parents for my dad's birthday this weekend and they insisted we go here and only had nice things to say.

Well for o1, we pre-ordered the stuffed pizza (as recommended) and requested to dine in as we would be ordering other things. I guess by \"other things\", the waiter assumed just drinks. Lol. We wanted food and this guy came back 20 minutes after drinks were delivered and my dad had to stop him from leaving again by saying \"hey wait we're ready to order\".

2, no napkins.
3, no silverware. (Even after salad was delivered)
4, they forgot the order of garlic cheese bread. We already waited long enough for the other food, we didn't bother reminding them.

However, the food we did actually receive was good. I really enjoyed it. I would have enjoyed the experience more if I had a competent server."}
{"text":"I was staying in Tempe for the NABA World Series and my wife and I decided to have dinner here. When we got to the restaurant it was packed! It also smelled amazing!

Great beer selection and great food. We couldn't finish our plates as the portions were extremely generous.  I had the diablo shrimp pasta and my wife had the fettucini Alfredo.

We will be back and we recommend this place to anyone visiting Tempe."}
{"text":"What a great place....There is so much food you can ALWAYS share! They have done a great job with the people they employ always friendly!!!!"}
{"text":"Always awesome, used the yelp app to check in early to cut down on the wait time...worked perfectly!!"}
{"text":"Since moving to the Phoenix area I have been searching for authentic Chicago thin crust pizza. Oreganos does a very good job with their thin crust!  Super thin, uniform crust. Zesty sauce. Terrific cheese and toppings!  Phil was our waiter at the south Scottsdale location. He was awesome at looking out for us as we ordered. Phil was spot on with his salad recommendations. I had family out from Chicago and we all agreed that this was a great pizza. Great atmosphere and just a couple blocks down from Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Oregano's since their original location in Old Town Scottsdale. They have done a great job adding locations. I've been to restaurants that struggle to duplicate the success. No so, the managers at Oregano's have their act together, including a full practice night of orders, acting customers, and creating great food before they open to the public.

Long live Oreganos. The thin crust Lawrence pizza is great, add sausage is you want some meat. The spinach broccoli pan pizza is amazing. The Pablo Picasso salad is a wonderful blend of a little spicy salsa and thin tortilla chips with chicken. You must try this salad. The place is good for kids, family, a night out, or the out of towners that come in. It's a must visit in Arizona. I've been lucky with the wait on Germann. If you go at a 7, prepare for a long wait and have a cocktail."}
{"text":"16 party.  Good service because we got there prior to opening.  Always a great mini stuffed pizza for lunch.  I had Number Uno Mini.  Very good.  Last visit pesto mini stuffed was amazing."}
{"text":"They've picked it up..."}
{"text":"We normally love oreganos and always have great service. Tonight as soon as we sat down we heard our server, Jack,complain to another server that he hadn't even made $200 tonight, then came over and we said we were just here for dessert tonight. He seemed annoyed but out in the order. We waited a really long time to get our cookie (not a big deal to us) and our waters were empty for almost our entire stay. Finally, another server, Jerry, was nice enough to check on us and he filled our waters and brought us the check. Jack took our order and we never saw him after that! Probably wouldn't come back if it wasn't for Jerry.

UPDATE: The GM called me and totally made up for our negative experience. Will definitely be back to try again. Great customer service/management! :)"}
{"text":"This place is a great local family Italian restaurant. Great food, great prices, great service."}
{"text":"The place is really cute, prices were good and the service was great.  I liked the cheese bread and sausage.  Portions were huge, but the rest of the food was mediocre.  Pasta was gummy and the cream sauce was watery.  The deep dish pizza crust was good, but the cheese and sauce was really salty.  Drinks were a little light on the alcohol.  Don't think I'd go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"We had a party of 20 for lunch and the service was excellent! Our server Michael was very atentive to the whole party. We had the manager come by as well as Michael to make sure everything was fine. The food was also excelente.  Everything came out like the way it's supposed to.  We will definitely be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"Everyone one in town is ranting about oregano's and how it's the best Italian food in town.  Yesterday was my first time dining at oregano's with a group of church people and wasn't impressed.  

First thing I do when I go to a restaurant is take a look in the bathroom.  As I walk across the threshold of the bathroom door.  A great breeze of old, milky, soggy urine smell just went up my nostrils.  What a great first impression huh?  

Well after sniffing of the urine breeze experience I was wondering how a manager can keep a restroom so dirty like that.  Well my hands are washed and starving to death.  The waitress was very attentive of me and ask me what I wanted to drink as I sat down.  Of course I always get the free H2O and I just ordered the meatball sandwich (took some advice from a friend) and one of good friends ordered the calamari.

My friends calamari came out before my dish came out.  The calamari looked a bit weird shaped (like a cheeto puffs) and I kept looking at it.  My friend offered me one and I accepted.  GROSS!! What was this I was tasting? Processed meat.... that's all I have to say.  Nothing remotely resembling calamari.  After that experience my food came up and just by the appearance of it.  The meatballs were dry, and I was right.  Nasty calamari and dry meatballs... What a great combination.

Next time maybe I'll try the pizza as people are ranting about it on yelp."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, and I'm always weary of restaurants labeling themselves \"Chicago-style,\" since it rarely measures up to what I expect. That being said, Oregano's is a solid place with good service and consistently delicious food. My go-to is either the   Bollo Pasta or eggplant parm and either are tasty and reasonably priced choices, especially the unlimited Bollo Pasta. Their thin crust pizza is really good too.
Save room for dessert because the Pizza cookie is my absolute favorite thing here. Bonus - they let you combine 2 flavors as a half and half option."}
{"text":"I Love Oregano's, but this specific location is terrible.  The food is not prepared as well as the other locations.  Very Very dissapointed"}
{"text":"HOLY MSG... They also changed their wings...  The sauce is the same, but they went to lower quality wings and drums... Was my favorite spot, not anymore."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Even the small pizza's are a great size.  My table ordered a Numero One-O and the Clark Street Meat Pizza.  Best of both worlds of meat pizza's.  Both were great.  You always worry at pizza joints if the pizza will be dosed with grease, but not here.

Service was quick and friendly, especially for us rolling in with around 15 people."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! I especially love this location! The outside patio on a beautiful day is worth the wait. And waiting is something you should anticipate because this place gets packed! So if you want to eat early then get there before 7 and if not be ready to wait at least half an hour to an hour give or take ten minutes. Then remember that your meal will take about 20 to 30 minutes to come out depending on what you order but don't worry about all of that, just go and get a drink and sit and relax with friends and family. 

As for food I usually always stick with pizza and wings. I recommend the medium and gold flavored wings. Gold isn't on the menu but just tell your server and they'll know what you mean. They are so delicious, honestly one of my favorite wing sauce of all times. 

As for pizza, Oh my god, there are so many great choices. If you want something different and want to try their chicago style pizza then I recommend the Numero One-0. If you like pan pizza try the Lawrence's Chicken Cheddar Broccoli. And if you like thin crust pizza's, which honestly I love, then try the Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato. The Grandma G's is my absolute favorite pizza at Oregano's, but don't take my word for it go and try them all out for yourself. 

Oh and I almost forgot, if you still have room left for dessert make sure to get the pizza cookie! That thing is so good, I just wish I didn't get full every time I go so I could actually order one."}
{"text":"Food is always great. I tried to place a to go order tonight and after getting hung up on three time I just drove over and I got a were busy. Nothing more not even I sorry for hanging up on you three time. I will not be back I this location. And to top it off my food was cold when I got it. :(

Well I had to change my review. I got a email from someone at Oreganos and was very impressed with that fact that they would take time to read my review and to send me a email."}
{"text":"I love Oreganos... Been coming here for 15 years! It's a default restaurant for my family,  & the pizza cookie is a MUST on bdays - you get one for free! Great food quality, server friendliness,  interior design, t-shirt puns. Pizza cookie (chocolate chip, lightly done!). The salads are the best, even people who don't like salad like the Pablo Picasso every time.  The thin crust pizza is fantastic,  the boom dip. .. OMG. The meatballs are amazing.  The DRINKS, oh geez, the bellini is the a BEST one I've ever had! 

Flavor note - Big thing for me - I DON'T LIKE SWEET TOMATO SAUCE/marinera. Oreganos sauce is savory,  not sweet. YAY! They are actually my fav marinera anywhere."}
{"text":"BEST SALAD I'VE EVER TASTED, I'm addicted and drive across town just to get their Shrimp Caesar Salad.  This is one of the best flavor combinations ever to grace my palate so I don't mind paying the money for it (something about that cilantro dressing, the slightly spicy shrimp and those crispy noodles).  This is all I ever order (frequently take out which is easy), but I love that my daughter can have their kid's pizza for an affordable price and she just adores getting the raw ball of dough to play with while waiting.  The decor is kinda kitchy but I don't notice too much because my nose is buried in the SALAD!  They always ask me if I want my iced tea packed up for the road, it's the little things....  Love it love it love it!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is seriously one of the best places to eat. I love their southwestern influence on Italian food. The Pablo Picasso salad is by far the best salad I've ever had. It's warm and hearty and full of flavor. Their calamari is really good as well. I've never had their thick crust pizza, however the thin crust is super yummy! Also, Alfredo of the dark with chicken is a spicy version of the dish that comes with a poblano pepper. So delish! Also, you must save room (if you can) for a pizza cookie...a-may-zing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always delicious. I always start off with the anti pasto salad...best I've ever had. Pizza is cooked perfectly with very fresh ingredients. And the desert choke is the best desert I have had. Mouth watering. This place has so much to offer and is always busy but always has great service!"}
{"text":"If you go here what you need to do is get on that meatball sub game. The meatballs are enormous, the cheese is melty and tasty and the sauce is robust. I like this place because the portion sizes are huge, possibly even too much as i never feel good after eating here. Then the bazooki cookie will find its way on my table and that melted piece of heaven comes with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and its 5 bucks. This place is dangerous because put it in the books that your going to fall asleep after. Great food just dont make plans to go out afterwards."}
{"text":"I have been to this oregano's 4 times and I've never been disappointed! The staff is friendly and eager to make (great) recommendations. I've had the fried calamari and the guacamole, both of which are terrific! The guacamole comes with what is essentially a crunchy thin crust white pizza. It's delicious, but SUPER garlicky so avoid it if you're on a date. I've had both the deep dish and the thin crust pizza and they're both AMAZING. The deep dish is extremely filling and does take a long time to prepare, so if you're not trying to be there for a while, I recommend just sticking with the thin crust. The Cajun chicken topping is great on any of the pizzas :)"}
{"text":"Expected much better. So disappointed. 

Wife, girls, and I were all excited to try Oregano's since seeing construction start at their Goodyear location. Lines were always super long the times we tried and not worth the wait. So, it wasn't until recently that we were able to check the place off our list. 

The staff are very pleasant and engaged with our kids. Wait was about 20 minutes, so not bad even with keiki in tow. Location is also fun with a 1960s throwback-cabin-factory vibe. Kitchen is viewable and you can see the crew working fast. Noise level is high, so probably not the place for you, if you want some quiet conversation or romance. 

Unfortunately, the food was lackluster. We ordered an app plate of fries and a Bistro Classic thin crust white pizza. The fries were tasty enough, but heavy with oil. The pizza? Well, it caused sadness. The girls and I can usually polish off a large white pizza like nothing. The Bistro Classic dough was so salty that it made sections of the pizza hard to eat and we ended up having half of it left. Very little garlic taste and the cheese was exceptionally bland.

Would have said something to our waitress, but she was gone so long that we didn't have time to confer. She did refill our drinks... as she brought the check and we were ready to leave. 

Oh, well. There's always Grimaldi's! :o)"}
{"text":"Naomi did an amazing job tending bar.  Great drinks and even better service. Will be back."}
{"text":"Let me give you a word of advice Oreganos. When my wife orders hot wings to go to bring home to me, her husband, don't tell her to get the medium because the hot are too hot. Your employees don't get paid to tell me what I want to eat. And to top it all off your \"hot\" is medium at best. P.S the rest of the United States recognizes wings sold by the dozen. What's the deal with only 10 per serving. Thats over a $1 a wing. Pretty steep if you ask me. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic deep dish pizza! Got the Uncle Ray's sausage and shrooms and shared it between four of us, 2 slices a piece, and was the perfect amount. Fairly cheap beer prices too. Got a tall 23oz wheat beer glass of Fat Tire for only $6
It did take about 40-45 mins to make the pizza but the service was excellent.
My family and I even went 2 nights in a row."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but unless you're prepared to wait minimum 45 minutes (even if it's just you), don't come here. 
I've tried all different days and times and still there's always an obnoxious wait."}
{"text":"Great Birthday lunch with my family! Cesar salad, chicken Parmesan, meat ball sandwich AND a cheese and pineapple pizza! Great food and amazing service! Thanks so much Michael for being such a great server!"}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here with the whole family. 

Kids get to play with dough while we wait for food. Service is great, pizzas and salads are DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing! You can't beat their pizza and creative toppings. Of course it's good food so there is always a long wait from when you order the food. The waitress I had kept taking my empty drink and not returning it. The service was kind of slow but the taste of the food is what keeps us around."}
{"text":"OK pizzas, bird-attacks during the meal, long wait...

People would tell me I just \"have to try Oreganos\". So, I finally went. I don't really understand why everyone said it was a \"must try\" restaurant.

FOOD:
The pizza slices are good, but not exception. They were a little on the burnt side but yet, not hot when they were brought to us. 

SERVICE:
I felt like we had to flag down the server everytime we needed something. Drinks refills took longer than they should have. 
There were 2 of us that went for lunch and we were there for over 2 hours. Ridiculous...

AMBIANCE
We sat outside and were continually attacked by pigeons as we tried to eat. It was kinda of noisy too because the place was packed... even outside it was loud. (You would think the noise would have kept the pigeons away)."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! Food was gross and the restaurant smelled like a sewer. We had a large group for a birthday and waited 3 HOURS for our pizza! Yes, not one, not two, 3 hours!! It was a Wednesday night! It was slightly busy but not busy enough to wait for that mess they call food. RUN!"}
{"text":"I am back in Phoenix for a little business with a craving for one of my favorite desert island foods, pepperoni pizza. I am very, very particular about my pepperoni pizzas. The crust must be thin and crispy. The sauce not too thick or too thin and the pepperoni flavorful. I like my pepperoni pizzas cooked well done. A little black on the crust is totally acceptable and preferred. My pepperoni pizza from Oregenos in Tempe was perfection! 

My side of wings was damn good as well."}
{"text":"I love to go eat here. The best place to go on a date, or just with friends. The food is always good. The staff is always nice and fast. We always go back with new friends. We each get one thing and share. To delish. See you there. Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad is what I always get, and I have taken it to party's, when I had to take something."}
{"text":"Food is not bad but took 3 hours from waiting to be seated till time time to leave very slow and it was a Monday."}
{"text":"Always fantastic!  Get the cheese bread to start your meal and be sure to save room for the pizza cookie - Yum!"}
{"text":"4 for me. Salad was good as always. We shared a artichoch dip that was it's usual good self. Ran into trouble with the wedding soup. Over the years they have changed the recipe and tonight was more than likely the last night my wife will order that. The manager addressed the concern.  When the cookie came out it was as if eating uncooked dough. Waiting for the the second attempt. Service is always good. Bring your appitite otherwise you'll leave with a doggie bag. Enjoy! The cookie is here and to perfection!"}
{"text":"Oh boy. One table came in well after us and was eating when our food arrived. Food was good as usual.  Manager bought desert (half cooked cookie more like cookie dough) that was not up to the norm for this restaurant. We'll be back because this was one of those shift change, busy, etc. kinda days for them. Server handled hers. (3:05pm-4:45pm)"}
{"text":"They have great margaritas, each different one with a different type of alcohol. The red Sangria was short on fruit but very tasty. We only tried appetizers but the MAC n Cheese was to die for!"}
{"text":"The good: My wife liked her meal and the service we had was good. 
The Bad: I had lasagna I only ate half and only because I was so hungry. The sauce they put on it was really hot (spicy hot). Marinara shouldn't be spicy hot and it should compliment the pasta. This did neither. I suspect that (based on the other reviews) they have a main cook that doesn't really care about quality. Since everything trickles down this would indicate the quality of the management. I have really enjoyed oregano's at other locations, but I probably won't go here again."}
{"text":"4 stars only because the wait is so long but the food is delicious and the portions are very filling (you'll have leftovers) great prices too."}
{"text":"I visited this Oregano's location for the first time last night and had a great experience. My waitress Hallee was extremely kind, friendly, and took great care of my friend and I as we sat on the patio in the pouring rain. The service was prompt and the whole staff in general was hard working and successfully attended each customer.

I ordered the Bollo Pasta which was an affordable option for an \"all you can eat\" dish. Hallee was also extremely helpful in constructing the dish to be exactly how I wanted, informing me of the varying sauces and pastas they had. As a whole, the garlic bread, pasta, and pizza cookie were delicious and I enjoyed it all! I wish it hadn't been raining as much as it seemed a little unsafe with the servers running around trying to not get the food wet while also attempting to not slip and fall. Overall a great experience, I'd recommend you to come to this location!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here after visiting Pomo right down the street. That visit was short lived, and we quickly came here. Glad that decision was made.!The atmosphere is great, a very 50's style of music and our waitress Rebecca was wonderful, just like the food. We plan to come back very soon."}
{"text":"Oregano's is a fun local place that I love to take visitors from out of town. The food is delicious and the portion sizes are monstrous. The hang-up is getting into the restaurant. Their policy is that you can't call ahead and they don't take reservations. It's a small restaurant so the wait time to get in during the busy dinner hour on Fri/Sat is usually an hour. They try to help the wait time by bringing around samples of their thin crust pizzas from time to time. The wait time is a big factor of why we don't go there very often 

Their portion sizes are huge and easily shareable. You only get an entree with your pizza or salad order with salad or bread à la carte. Most of the pasta dishes will include some bread slices.

The decor is fun but the restaurant is small and usually busy so it is typically noisy. Probably not the best atmosphere for a one on-one dinner. 

Overall it is a fun place to take a group of people and order a bunch of dishes when you have time for a long dinner. Everything I've had there was excellent! I usually get the Big Rig pasta which has just enough kick for me. We will be back."}
{"text":"This new store opened up a few weeks ago so we decided to let things calm down before trying it, well we decided it was a good time to check it out. First off, the waiting area is far too small, people cramming against each other trying to eek out a waiting spot. We were told 10 minutes for a table, ending up being 20. Waitress arrived quickly to take our drink order, 1 diet pepsi, 1 regular pepsi, wife says hers was diet and I'm sure mine was diet also, which is what I ordered. I ordered THE ORIGINAL ITALIAN STUFFED sandwich and the wife ordered the  ALFREDO'S ARTICHOKE LASAGNA, which arrived after about 45 minutes, cold. The flies made more stops at our table than the waitress did, serious fly problem here, they were everywhere. 1st time and last time. Oh, and don't think about trying to substitute a garden salad for the chips or fries, even though half the menu is for specialty salads they don't serve a house or dinner salad. What?"}
{"text":"I love every Oregano's location, but this is the one I visit most frequently, and now mostly takeout since my toddler is a little too active for a busy restaurant. The staff here can't be beat- every single person I make eye contact with says hello, goodbye, or thank you, and it goes a long way. They truly seem happy to be there, so Oregano's- you pick some winners! 

My fave flaves are: 
- The Numero One-O: But be prepared- I've only had heartburn a handful of times in my life and once was after this pizza, but I don't regret it. The other specialty pizzas are a little too \"weird\" in the toppings for me, so I usually go with one I build myself- simple and tasty.
- All the salads. Pablo Picasso has some bite, the Big Dinner Salad is awesome with some chicken on top, and the Antipasto salad is my new favorite- such great flavor! 
- All the pasta is good, too, but recently tried Alfredo the Dark and was really surprised how much I liked it- it wasn't \"alfredo-y\" at all- just a lightly creamy pasta with a tiny touch of heat.

Side notes: they will only seat you when the party is present, so make sure your group is on time, or put in an advance order of the Guac-a-Tony, since it takes a while to get to the table. also- check your order if you get takeout- I've had a handful of times where they've missed a side or a dressing, or something... not a huge deal, but they are busy and things happen!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place. The food was not only delicious, but the inside is adorable - old TVs with old black and white movies playing.

Everyone in the restaurant, either patron or worker, looked happy and was having a grand ol time. My kind of pizza joint."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Oregano's.  Love the food, the staff is super friendly and always very accommodating.  We will to continue to go back again and again."}
{"text":"We visited Oregano's while traveling through the area after seeing some of the great pizza photos on Yelp. Upon walking in, we were greeted by 5 smiling faces welcoming us- wow! We sat down in a booth and admired our surroundings, what a cool place! Lots of retro decor, with a homey italian feel. Our server was Paige and she was Excellent! Attentive, detail oriented, described the food items perfectly with any questions we had, simply just awesome! We had a perfect experience at Oregano's. The entire staff was attentive and helpful (something you don't see every day). Now the food....the food was ridiculous! For starters we had a house salad which was awesome, we ordered a deep dish and a thin crust pizza, flavors were perfect and plentiful so looking forward to our leftovers. Save room for the desert pizza cookie, it's served with icecream and the cookie tastes freshly baked. Wow, excellent for sharing (or not!) We'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We found Oreganos while vacationing here a few months back. Little did we know it was a chain? Thing is it doesn't feel like one & that's just something we love about dining at Oreganos. You can get a Chicago pan pizza and a thin crust and be quite happy with both. Don't forget to finish your meal off with a pizza cookie topped w/icecream omg! We visited on a Friday around 4 and when we left the place was packed! I guess we're not the only ones who love Oreganos."}
{"text":"Oregano's may have become a chain but it still always feels like a local restaurant to me. Amazing food and huge portions so you always will have lunch the next day! Their pizzas are thin crust and really tasty, but don't forget to try oregano's favorite salad or one of their sandwiches. My recommendations are the Veggie Wedgy or the Italian sub. But above all else, you must not eat so much at dinner that you are full for dessert. Their pizza cookie is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"They got the BEST dessert ever!!!!! U just can't miss it!!!!' Every single time :)"}
{"text":"Super slow hostess with empty tables. Probably not a good idea for lunch. Or parties more than 4."}
{"text":"First off, the Wait Staff and Hostess Staff were very good. No complaints there. We waited quite some time for a table on a Sunday evening but we're not sure why. Nevertheless, with plenty of places to sit and wait outside and with nice weather in Cave Creek most of the time, this is not a big issue. We ordered only a small salad and a classic thin crust pizza but we waited probably 45 minutes to get the pizza. Meanwhile there were a LOT of kids running around and being very disruptive. I realize a restaurant can't help that - just a warning that this is apparently a popular spot for families with small children. If you're looking for a nice quiet evening for a date or otherwise intimate dinner, this isn't the place - despite the pretty garden lights overhead. Looks romantic but isn't. The blaring music from the Rat Pack Era was too much as well. The patio is pet friendly, which we LOVE but one woman had her dog ON the table. The hostess did see this but said nothing. We love dogs but that shouldn't be tolerated. All in all, it was actually very frustrating with all the kids, the wait & the blaring, annoying music. Wanted to love it but didn't"}
{"text":"1st time at Oregano's.  Going to try a pan pizza.  Menu is well covered reasonable pricing.  They offer oven baked sandwiches, pasta, salads, pizza Chicago style!!  20 locations in AZ. Pizza looks delicious not greasy at all"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. salads are delightful and very good. Love love the wings and tried boom dip for the first time. Delicious will definitely be back. Service was very good our waitress did such a great job."}
{"text":"This 5 star review is all for Leah MILLER. She works at the bar and gave EXCELLENT service. This is my FIRST time in AZ and 1st time at Oregano's and she was VERY present w all her customers and very intuitive to their needs. Her service made the food just that great and the overall experience perfect. Thanks Leah MILLER :-)"}
{"text":"I have had better experiences at this place in the past, but on this visit, nothing went well. We were seated promptly and drinks arrived in a reasonably timely fashion. The Moscow Mule tasted like mouthwash. Appetizer took 20 minutes to arrive. We go there because it is good for the kids, but on this trip, when we asked for the pizza dough balls they are generally provided to play with, we were told there were none available. In a pizza place there is no dough available?! Our entrees arrived, but the kids pizza slices were no where to be seen. When we asked about them, we were told they would be out promptly. Twenty minutes later, their slices arrived. They were so hot even an adult would have to wait a good five minutes to eat them. Obviously they had been forgotten. I ordered a dirty martini up. The waitress said the bartender wasn't sure what \"up\" meant. I explained. She then asked if I still wanted it shaken with ice. Needless to say we left before dessert. We waited fifteen minutes to get the check even though we took our credit card up to the front. It will be a long while before we go back to this place again."}
{"text":"We always noticed the long lines to get in this place. We ate here tonight and realized the wait was because the restaurant is small and it takes forever to get your food. The food was good but not great. Not sure we will come back"}
{"text":"Bellinis! Their pizza is always good and everything I've eaten from here is an instant classic."}
{"text":"Every establishment for Oregano's that I have dined at was great. The Quality and service, food and portions was great. Every meal choice that I had was delicious!"}
{"text":"From outside the appearance of the building looks like it's starting to run down or if that's the intention. Upon entering; the place felt really hot, I couldn't tell if the A/C was broken or they were too cheap to keep the place cool for paying customers.
Looking over the menu, it appeared they didn't have much to offer -- almost felt like a rushed put together menu. So I ordered The Big Beefstro Salad. The meat was tender and soft; however, for the lettuce, it's standard. I found it to be too much food, and it got boring to eat quickly. 
There was also flies flying around, that made me also think the way they prepare food is dirty. Since, after eating there I just felt sick. I just won't be coming back here. A/C doesn't work, appears to be run down, and a fly attraction."}
{"text":"Calamari was awesome ! The service  was ok,and for not being that busy it took forever for our dinner to to come out! The food was good tho ,so we took some good with the bad and will return to order calamari and pizza next time ;)"}
{"text":"Oregano's is always GREAT!  I've been going to all their locations for over 15 years.  It is great for small parties or big groups.  My personal favorites are the guacatony, the bistro classic, and the bollo pasta.  It is hard to go wrong with anything there.  But best of all are their pizzookies!"}
{"text":"I love oregano's!  I have been visiting all of the valley locations for over 10 years.  It is consistently good food and service!  I'm a fan of their salads, especially the pablo picasso.  My absolute favorite thing here is the guacatony!  Their pizzas are tasty.  My favorite is the bistro classic.  My favorite sandwich there is the big beef!  It is huge!  You cannot leave without a pizzookie... well, sometimes you're just too full, but they are delish.  I usually ask them to bake them 75% though because I'm not a fan of cookie dough and ice cream."}
{"text":"Oregano's hardly ever disappoints. Friends and I did take out this time. Staff is efficient in coding your order to make sure you get everything correctly. We went w pizza and salad. Pablo Picasso salad is one of our favorites. I usually prefer the thin crust to the deep dish here. 

Guacatony and pizzookie are always good additions to meal here!"}
{"text":"My kids and husband enjoy coming here to have a dinner night out. The prices are great with huge portions. I love all there appetizers especially the  brochette. They also have the great cookie dessert . They are very kid friendly and while you wait for tables they can play outside."}
{"text":"If you're on a diet, avoid this place like the plague!! But otherwise, you really can't go wrong. Portions are enormous so plan according. The spinach artichoke dip was enough for me, my husband and my 2yo son for dinner, so we boxed our entire pizza and of course got a pizookie. My son's first taste of the pizookie was like that scene from Requiem for a Dream. He was jumping up and down chanting \"cookie!\" So I had to eat really quickly to make sure I got some! Delicious! 

As for my previous visits to various Oreganos locations... The guacamole appetizer is ginormous and tastes great. My friends rave about the drinks, but I was in a wine mood today and enjoyed the house merlot. I've had the pesto pasta bake before, and it almost has too much cheese if that's even possible. The mushroom pasta wasn't quite as good but still just fine. Oreganos is always reliable."}
{"text":"This place has great deep dish pizza and really huge salads. I love to go here for cocktails too. Deep dish takes a bit of time so get there a little earlier than you plan on eating.  It can also get pretty packed so be prepared."}
{"text":"Unreal how good this place is. All the negative reviews about waiting is too bad. Most great places have this problem. Go at odd times or expect a little wait. The place is cool with a nice outdoor area. Our server, Drew, was awesome. The pizza was amazing. I love mushrooms and that mushroom pizza packed on portobellos. The pesto penne came in a bread bowl and we added sausage and man did it have great flavor. It was our first time there so we got a free dessert. The baked cookie was so amazing."}
{"text":"So, off to a good start, we've been here plenty of times, with kids numerous times. We ended up going on a stupid busy busy day @ around 7pm for dinner. Food is amazing btw the atmosphere is great, the kids get dough to play with \"no crayons and paper to color on btw\" So our night started on a long wait, which is fine we decided ourselves to wait.. Got our table, and first ordered drinks,.. we just wanted water please been waiting outside for awhile just water,... well were outta ice they said, manager went out to buy ice.. really really what restaurant runs outta ice???? just fine, we ordered, finally recieved water ,... almost 45min later were told the dinner my husband ordered, was lacking shrimp cause they ran out.. how did they not know there out of shirmp before ordering and wating almost an hour to tell us?????? so he had to order another dinner and wait again.. long story short, we got his meal and dessert free but he was angered since we had a 4 in a half hour long dinner. didnt even get out of there til 11:30pm so needless to say dont go on a stupid busy day, if you see a long line id suggest pass is up or your meal may be passed up by them."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 16 people.  We called the day ahead and were told there would be no problem if we came at 430 before the dinner rush. When we got there we waited 35 minutes to be seated. When we were finally seated on the patio, there was no one else out there. The food was good and our server was pleasant.   We were seated outside which would not be good in the summer or on a cooler winter evening.  I don't know if they can accommodate a large group inside.  The one person  who ordered glutton free pizza was not happy, but everyone else seemed to enjoy their food.  Our server was pleasant, but service was slow.  I will go back but not with a large group."}
{"text":"I love coming here the food is great! The only negative thing is that a few of the servers need more training on customer service! Other than that everything else is great. It's great seeing how much business there bringing in to the cave creek area."}
{"text":"Oregano's has outstanding pizza.  Hands down.  Enough said.  

My absolute favorite is the Bistro Classic with added banana peppers, pepperoni, and sausage.  It has a very thin crust so two people can actually eat a large (oh my god I admitted that...we do take some home okay) without feeling disgusting.  That said, I've never made it to dessert.  

Their salads are awesome as well.  My favorite is the Antipasto Thing.  

I think the best thing about this location is the waitress that we always hope we get.  I shamefully don't know her name but she is easy to recognize.  She's really tall and skinny with dark brown hair and funny as hell.  The first time we went there she sat down at our table and told us a joke.  The next time we had her we made her sit down to tell us a joke.  And she was funny both times.

You might have to wait if you get there around lunch or dinner time.  Every time I've been to any of their locations they have been packed.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is what you know and expect, but holy cheese the service last night was insane.  We had a fifteen minute wait when we walked up and were served couple pieces of a pizza and had our drink order taken while we waited.  Our waitress (so sorry I couldn't remember her name) was great and friendly and we never had to wait for a thing.  Even having to listen to some ASU bros describe how blown away they were by the end of The Usual Suspects couldn't dampen a great meal and amazing service."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience at this oreganos. Selma, the hostess, was one of the rudest people I have ever encountered at a restaurant.  When we arrived at oreganos, we were told that it was a 2 hour wait on a Saturday night.  Her attitude made us not consider waiting for our table and move on to a restaurant that appreciates their customers.  Selma, thanks for nothing!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is good, but my favorite thing they have on the menu is the meatball sandwich with the waffle fries.

This place is totally a local legend and most of the things I have had here were good. Great spot for a group especially when its not too hot and you want to sit outside. The service is pretty good and one thing I have always appreciated is that when waiting to be seated they give you complimentary fountain drinks,...maybe that isn't common but they did it for me a few times."}
{"text":"I've have multiple (and nothing but) great experiences here. Their pizza, both thin and thick crust, is fantastic. The think crust does take a while to come out, but if you decide to wait, it is very worth it. If you don't decide to wait however you're still in a for a delicious meal with their thin crust! They also have great lunch specials, I recommend the big rig pasta dish if you decide to go this route. Their side salads are the most generous portions I have ever experienced, and to top it all off you MUST order a Pizookie. This pizza cookie mix of a dessert will change your life and should definitely not be forgotten about when visiting Oreganos!"}
{"text":"What is the big deal about this place?!

It's not great, but pretty good. Not bad, but ok. Just is what it is. We had some wings and a stuffed pizza, and the wings were undersized yet pretty flavorful. The pizza, I just don't understand the hype. Maybe I've had Giordano's, Gino's, and Lou Malnati's too much in Chicago but this place just wasn't it. The pizza is okay, and just okay... if nothing else, WAY too salty. After a while, I felt like I was consuming a salt lick.

Service was weird, and I'm pretty sure our server was on coke. the restaurant was PACKED and the place was buzzing and he came and sat at our table and started shooting the shit. It was very bizzare. We got someone elses order of wings, and didn't know they weren't ours until the server told us (after we had eaten them all) so we felt kind of bad. 

I'd go back here again but I wouldn't really be too eager to."}
{"text":"Got on the wait list as it's Mother's Day every place is busy so this worked out well, food was great shrimp oh so good and large our vegan guest were satisfied as they had a lot of choices"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here today at lunch.  Really a kind of blah meal.  The atmosphere is nice, although the piped in music is a bit to loud.

I had the chicken parmesan.  It was good but would have been better with a different type of noodles.  The larger flat noodles were a little dry and having angel hair noodles would have made this dish perfect.

My wife had the lasagna and called it the worst lasagna in the world.  I tried a bite and it was horrible.  She at about 1/3 of it and I don't blame her.

Service was poor.  The server never came around to refill my iced tea.  When he brought the check with my empty iced tea glass sitting on the table, I had to ask to have my iced tea filled.

The place wasn't busy, so it's not like the server had other things to do.  He was mostly standing over with other servers doing nothing.

Plus, we had a fly that kept buzzing about our food and I kept swatting at it until I eventually chased it away to someone else's table.

My wife says she'll never eat at an Oregano's again. I'm iffy if I would eat there again.  There are better options anyway."}
{"text":"The service was great . Very friendly . All smiles . The food was amazing ! Took a while to get our food after ordering . But worth the wait . Will be back soon ."}
{"text":"Went to this spot with some friends. Had a party of eight (4 adults and 4 children). It was only a 39 minute wait on a Friday night. They sat us in a back portion of the restaurant which was great. Our server \"Jonathan\" was great. The order arrived within 20 minutes of us ordering. The food was good, which appeared to be fresh. The interior was clean and spotless. I liked the fact that the kids received play dough instead of crayons to play with. Good spot!!!"}
{"text":"SERVICE was GREAT

ATMOSPHERE was GREAT....patio dining with a nice breeze on a warm day.  

Deep Dish PIZZA was the best i've ever had.  Keep in mind that it takes 35 - 45 minutes to cook but well worth the wait.  

Wish they had one in CALI.....  : ("}
{"text":"Love this place lunch or dinner however especially love their lunch specials! Surprise location is great addition to our town! I have alway received great service with everyone genuinely kind and you can tell they enjoy their job! Shout out to Charlie - or Chucks Baby our server who brought us spice and entertainment with our food!"}
{"text":"We ate at Oregano's when I came down for Spring Training. This place is awesome. Sometimes it is hard to get in as it is so crowded though. Highly recommended and worth the wait, if you have to wait. Although we have little kids so if the wait is 30 minutes plus we usually go elsewhere and come back another day."}
{"text":"We ate here the night before the Phoenix Rock & Roll Marathon. Even though we went early, it was packed. We were told about 20-30 min wait. We found seat at an outdoor bar area and ordered a drink. After we asked, the person taking care of our drink order said we could order food as long as we did not mind sitting where we were. This was fine with us. It is a large place with covered seating, but still a lot of the eating area is outside. I got the Coop De Ville Jumbo chicken parm. My wife got the King Parmesan Eggplant. Each item came on a bed of pasta of your choice and two pieces of baked garlic bread. The amount of food on each plate was tremendous. Everything was cooked and seasoned just right. Their sauce was not to heavy, not overly spiced and a very generous portion was given. We had a very positive experience from start to finish and would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is great and so was our waiter.However your business is not code compliant.You have 2 handicapped spots and one of which always has someone picking up an order.The parking lot is not accessible for wheel chairs and you need to smooth it out so we do not fall."}
{"text":"Good service, awesome food, great atmosphere. 
This is our new favorite Italian restaurant"}
{"text":"Yummy food! Great casual atmosphere! Awesome service!"}
{"text":"The food is soooo yummy! I recomend the zany zeti. They give the kids dough to play with. What a great idea!"}
{"text":"Always a wait, but food above average and wine reasonably priced. Nice location in the middle of Cave Creek. Staff and service above average."}
{"text":"Sometimes you go to a restaurant and just eat. When you come to Oregano's, you walk into a place with warm welcome, courteous servers, and EPIC food! 

When you are greeted, there usually is a wait. However, it is worth it. They give you samples of pizza and even offer drinks while you wait! How amazing is that? 

Once you sit down, you realize you're in another place. You're not in AZ, you feel like you're in a whole different city! 

Our server was Rhys. Not only does Rhys have an amazing name, but his conversation skills and ability to make the table laugh was making our occasion at dinner fun, exciting and delicious. 

He always refilled our drinks without even asking and wasn't over the top. He was SO good, that we gave him a hefty tip knowing we would come back and ask for him specifically. At one point, I dropped my wallet without even knowing it and he nicely notified me! 

This couldn't have been a better place to spend a Thursday dinner or even any lunch or dinner, to spend at Oregano's. 

For the Horde!"}
{"text":"First visit to this location have been to tempe, mesa, and Scottsdale locations.  Very consistent no matter the location.  Always order Italian gold wings, very good! Thin style pizza is great. Good pizza place never a let down!"}
{"text":"We usually dine in or take out about once a month. Went there last weekend for a large take out order. The young lady behind the counter could not have been more professional. ( I think her name was Colleen) she told me up front that it was peak time and the deep dish takes a while. Her friendly demeanor made the extra wait a bit less stressful. She offered me some ice water while I waited. As I was paying, she noticed my military hat and asked if I was a veteran. When I said yes, retired, she said if you show me your ID, I can offer you a discount. She then had to call a manager over to override the key for the discount. The manager shook my hand, thanked me for my service and proceeded with the discount. While I was waiting, I was observing Colleen give other customers superb service. When the food was finally ready, Colleen saw it was too much for me to carry at once, so she volunteered to carry the remaining bags to my car. It is CS like this that will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just enjoyed dinner here and I'm still stuffed but I wanted to let you all know that I have been to 5 or 6 Oregano's locations and all are excellent but the experience tonight was really over the top. 

We arrived at around 6pm and were told it would be a 25-30 minute wait. No problem, there's always a wait at Oreganos and it's worth it. After putting our name on the list we were immediately greeted by Kevin who offered to bring us a cold beer while we wait. Yes please! He brought us our beer promptly and then showed us to some seats on the patio where we could enjoy the lovely September evening while we waited. Who does that?! 

We were seated in about 15 minutes and were greeted by the lovely Kelley who took great care of us with a smile. She was on top of everything! We enjoyed our dinner salads and pizza with as much parmesan as she could pile on. Our usual is the XL thin crust with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. We like to have leftovers for the next day. The pizza arrived more quickly than promised and arrived piping hot with loads of cheese. Yum! Love this place! 

Parking is at a premium here but we were able to park at the Cigna next door so no problem. 

Oregano's has always been one of our favorites and our experience was outstanding. I hope our servers Kevin and Kelley will be rewarded for their fantastic job."}
{"text":"My family and I went to dinner here tonight. Our waiters name was Jorge. He was the best waiter we have ever had at any restaurant. The customer service was amazing! Better than fancy steak houses! The alfredo after dark is my favorite thing on the menu it's always on point! If you stop in ask for Jorge we gave him a 50% tip he was very sweet and polite!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food each and every time.  Austin rocks the service every time.  Best Italian food on the west side."}
{"text":"I usually love Oreganos...but today not so much. They changed the toasted raviolis and the new kind is not good. The service was mediocre only checked on us once in an hour and a half...just disappointed. And Oreganos needs to bring back the Veggie Wedgie."}
{"text":"Had a half great half not so great experience last night, here. 
The appetizer and salad came out quickly and were delicious. 
Pizza came out next (45 min after ordering it) and it wasn't what we had ordered. Typically I will mention it's not the right order and just eat it anyway to avoid wasting food. The group decided we should get what we ordered, so we ended up talking to another server who wasn't ours and getting the problem solved. 

The right pizza took another 50 minutes to come out and the drinks took quite some time too. Our server seemed nice but also seemed to avoid us a little bit. 

Finally the right pizza came out but was over-cooked to the groups liking. 

We asked to speak to a manager and Tammy came out and was great! She appreciated our honesty, apologized for the negative parts of our experience and was even gracious enough to buy our appetizer, pizza and offer a gift card. We so appreciate her demeanor and appreciative attitude toward us. Thank you, Tammy! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For most of my visits I'd rate this location as a 3-4. The wait times are fairly long and the wait staff are hit or miss but the food is always solid. And the portions are crazy.

We went for my dad's birthday tonight and it was a bit of a disaster. We had a party of 7 with 4 people over the age of 60. We waited an hour and were seated in the back of the patio. It was 99 degrees at that hour and we were seated where there were no misters. We asked if we could be reseated inside or in the main part of the patio. The woman who was the manager told us we'd have to wait for 90 mins for either. She claimed there was a party of 15 that was waiting ahead of us. As it turns out, that was a party of 10 and they showed up an hour after we did. After unnecessary back and forth, they moved the not so powerful portable AC in our direction so we stayed.

The food, as usual, was solid but the service was bad. Our waitress dropped multiple comments throughout our dinner about how other guests under the covered patio with misters were annoyed that the direction of the portable AC changed. She didn't come check on us very much so we had empty water glasses for a lot of the night. 

Overall, the way they dealt with the seating was unprofessional and difficult. This could have been avoided if they had asked us if we were ok with being seated in that part of the patio prior to placing us there. I don't think I'll be back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Luckily we got seated right away.  Service today was just ok.  This was my 2nd time at this location.  I'm not a biggest fan of their pizza.  I'm a pizza snob since I'm from Brooklyn.  

Next time I'll go with raviolis and a cookie desert."}
{"text":"Oregano's has been one of my go to places!  Why... they offer consistency, delicious Italian recipes, great sauce, huge portions, great staff and easy for pick up. 

The salads are huge and always fresh.  I love the Pablo Picasso Mexican salad add avocado.  It's my favorite!!  Boom dip to start is a great way to start.  I also like their Calamari appetizer with their spicy red sauce, it wonderful.  

The pizza is great depending on what type you are in the mood for, thick crust or thin.  The pasta dishes like the Big Rig or the Alfredo the Dark with Chicken are outstanding. I love their buttery garlic bread.  I've also had a few sandwiches over the years of visiting here and they are pretty decent.  I love the meatball grinder.  You will need a to-go box for sure!!  

Dessert, usually this doesn't happen often, however if you have enough people with you I recommend having the cookie with ice cream.  Fresh baked... you choose!  Chocolate chip, macadamia nut, peanut butter, and it's served piping hot!!  Very good!!  

Consistency goes a long way in my book... especially since I've been to multiple locations of Oregano's for lunches and dinners over the last 10 years.  They really have it together!!"}
{"text":"So this location has a chill patio surrounded by two indoor dining areas and a bar. Very nice indeed. Unfortunately they only have a few mixed drinks, beers, and wines - no full bar. Oh, btw the food here is very very good!"}
{"text":"Really good place for some fun food. Everything is in huge portions...semi-family style. The pan pizzas take a while so keep that in mind, and the salads and sandwiches are amazing. Love the Wedge and oreganos favorite salad. Killer meatballs too!"}
{"text":"OBSESSED! We have loved Oreganos and have been coming here even before moving to AZ almost 14 years ago! Everyone is always super friendly and are knowledgeable about every menu item. The atmosphere is fun and upbeat... always worth the wait! Oh and the food - AMAZING! Perfection every single time and you'll never leave hungry... but you'll usually leave with a box or two!"}
{"text":"I have both eaten here and carried out pizza. Being from chicago i have high standards for my pies and oreganos does a good job. Its not outstanding, just good the service is good, and the only drawback is the parking and crowds, which usually translates into long waits for ok food. oh, and the salads are good too. give it a try, im sure you'll like it."}
{"text":"As far as chain restaurants go, this one is top notch. It has everything you could want in a food venue. Great appetizers, huge portions, great drink selections, and more.

I like the fact that they make \"strong\" mixed drinks, and they usually have some great local and seasonal beers on tap. The Guac-a-Tony appetizer is by far my favorite. I even know a guy who, the first thing he does when he comes in from out of town is orders this. Just make sure you have more than two people in your group before trying this appetizer otherwise you won't be able to eat anything else.

Indeed, they make great pizza, but there is so much more to this restaurant than their pizza. In fact, I don't remember the last time I actually got a pizza from them."}
{"text":"The Big rig pasta is by far the tastiest Italian dish around. I would put it up against any Italian restaurant specialty. The Pablo Picasso salad is quite tasty as well. Come to think of it, I have yet to eat something there that wasn't good."}
{"text":"If I had to eat at one place every day (and had to pay for it), this would be it. Great food, cheap prices, friendly staff. The wait for a table is always long--oh well. Have another cold one."}
{"text":"Save room for the pizza cookie!!  Food here is delicious but its big portions!  I've always had great service at any of their locations.  Great Italian atmosphere.  Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"We love coming to Oreganos!  My son gets the bottomless Bowl a Pasta with two huge meatballs.  He likes it better than homemade.  My salad was delish.  Oreganos always goes big with everything on their menu.  Place is loud and fun.  You could bring a screaming baby here and I doubt anyone would notice."}
{"text":"Great location, clean restaurant, and friendly staff that are efficient, caring and accommodating. Stuffed, deep and thin crust pizzas are A Plus! Wings, fries, sandwiches, pasta and Pizza Cookie dessert are also delicious! Sigh up to their rewards club to get special offers and to earn a free pizza cookie for your birthday!"}
{"text":"I love Oregano's and they seem to know how to hire nice and happy people at all locations. The servers here are attentive and accommodating. My favorite appetizer is the garlic bread with cheese, entree is the numero uno stuffed pizza and all of the pizza cookie desserts are awesome!"}
{"text":"First time here was not bad like others have documented on Yelp. We decided to come at opening to avoid a potential rush later in the day. The store opened 3 minutes early which is a plus. Within a few minutes of opening, this place was packed! The staff greeted us warmly and seemed genuine. We were seated quickly and our orders were taken soon after. Our waiter was knowledgeable, courteous and accommodating. We also got samples of thin crust pizza! I've never been to an Oregano's that has given pizza samples. Awesome! 

My girl ordered the lunch portion of the Alfredo in the dark and said it was consistent with how other locations make it which means to her it was delicious. I ordered the lunch portion Stuffed Pizza. Today's variety was be the Numero Uno which contains pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers and onions. It was delicious as it was baked well and the flavors blended well together. The food took longer than we're used to waiting at Oregano's but that's ok since this a brand new location with newly trained  also ordered the pizza cookie which we got for free as a member of the Oregano's club. I got an email for a free cookie to celebrate their anniversary. I also get those for my birthdays and other occasions determined by Oregano's. the cookie was baked well as it was soft and chewy (good thing). We'll be coming back"}

{"text":"Pizza and appetizers are awesome. The garlic bread and wings are good. The pizza cookie dessert is great. You can split the flavor on the cookie dessert with chocolate chip, macadamia nut, or peanut butter."}
{"text":"Very very good pizza!  The food here is really unbeatable and the layout of the restaurant is cozy and friendly.  There is almost always a wait around dinner time, so be prepared for that.
Don't forget the fresh baked cookie for dessert. :D"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong when you eat here and order the thin crust pizza, I've never tried a flavor I didn't like.  If you want the chicago-style pizza, be prepared to wait, they take about 45 mins to cook.  Also, the desert cookie is really good, big enough to split between 4 people I would say."}
{"text":"my wife have been there about 5-6 times since we moved here from just south of Chicago. they have some of the best pizza around and we have a great time every time we go there"}
{"text":"It's not often that you go to a place and everything you are served is A+ Amazing!!! It was our first time there and although the wait time could put black Friday lines to shame....the food made up for it. The Boom Dip, BBQ wings, BBQ Chicken pizza, a Dirty Monkey and one Bellini later:  HAPPY FAMILY.  Definitely a great place to eat and drink!"}
{"text":"I know Oregano's doesn't normally do call ahead seating, but we thought we'd give it a try since it's a new location. Nope. First come, first serve, they said. My friend headed over to put our name on the list to save some time as I was leaving work. They quoted him an 1 hour 25 min. It ended up being around 45 minutes. Not bad! It was a very nice evening to eat on the patio. Our server was nice but said he was \"under the weather\". Hope it's not contagious... We ordered the garlic cheese bread with marinara (it's a must!) as we decided on the main course. It was delicious, as always.
As my friend finished his glass of water, I noticed there was an empty pink sweetener packet in his cup.... What is THAT doing in there? Did they give him a dirty cup? Kind of disturbing. He asked our server for another glass. So weird! We knew it was going to be a wait, but we ended up ordering the 10\" stuffed pizza with pepperoni and meatball, since I don't think I'd ever had it before. It took another 45 minutes to get.
The pizza was EXTREMELY cheesy. Too much cheese, really. Made me a little sick to my stomach. And I think it was overcooked because the crust was really crunchy. What a disappointment! I definitely won't be ordering that again... But I'll be back for the garlic bread and pizookie."}
{"text":"Went to Oregano's for dinner on New Year's Day to start the year out right. They were really busy, as they always are. The hostess quoted our wait to be 1 hr to 1 hr 10 min. It was very cold outside, but I was dressed warmly and they had the heaters on so it wasn't too bad. A guy brought out pizza samples a couple of times for the people waiting. Always appreciated. My friend went inside to get me a glass of water from the bar. Our wait only ended up being 45-50 min. It's amazing the crowds that Oregano's brings in and how many people are willing to wait. I really wish they operated in bigger buildings. I'm sure they do it for the ambiance (and maybe cost of the space), but they would be successful in a larger space too. I know I would eat here more often if the wait times were shorter.
When we got to our table, I had to switch chairs because the one looked like it had grease on it... then my chair wobbled--I think the tiles were uneven. Small annoyances. Also the lighting was very dim and I used my phone to light up the menu. We ordered the garlic cheese bread with marinara... that is a must for a visit at Oregano's. When it came out, it was really garlicky! It always is, but I think this one was at another level. Very tasty though. For my entree, I ordered the Bollo Pasta (angel hair) with meatballs. This dish is actually unlimited but I can never get through one bowl after the garlic bread and still save a little room for Pizookie! I love the peanut butter chocolate chip they have now, but we got the original chocolate chip. Didn't even finish it... I was so full! Looking forward to the opening of the Goodyear location.
One other comment I have is about the Zany Ziti... now I'm not a pasta expert, but I know the pasta they use for this dish is diagonal cut, not square cut as I know ziti to be. Not sure why they call it ziti if it's actually penne?"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a friend. Fortunately the place was not packed as Oregano's usually are. But even though there were plenty of open tables, we were still told there would be a 5-10 minute wait. Okay. It was closer to 10 min, but not a big deal. We ordered the garlic cheese bread with marinara, which is a must when I come to Oregano's. It's probably my favorite thing. For my entree, I went with the Zany Ziti (which is actually penne) and since it's supposed to have meat sauce, I decided against paying extra for meatballs. But when I received it, it was not meat sauce, just marinara. That was a disappointment! The pasta was also overcooked and falling apart. Not the best. For dessert we got the chocolate chip pizookie since they are always tasty. Wish I could give a higher rating, but the pasta was a big fail."}
{"text":"Not my first time to Oregano's or to this location. Never had a bad experience here or any of the locations.  Staff is always very accommodating and friendly.  And whats notable is all the staff is ready to help serve you and not just your server.  Which may not seem like a big deal, but seems to be rare at other places these days.  So I feel they deserve all five stars. 

Tip 1:  I would recommend the Kaboom Dip as a starter and maybe ask for extra or more bread.  Tried that for the first time last night, pretty sure I will be ordering that every time here on out. 

Tip 2: Its a very popular place, so expect there to be a longer wait, and a longer time for your food to come out.  So sit back, order something cold and an starter to share and relax while you wait.  

We sat out at the patio and had great service.  Ordered way to much food but loved it. 
We had three young kids with us, and the service was great even through the patio was packed with large groups.  - Also somewhat rare these days. 

Thank you to Makenna for the excellent service. 

**Would request/Suggest they buy more high chairs.  They were all used when we were there for most of the evening.  But the staff was very accommodating and helpful with it."}
{"text":"Good food but the wait really wasn't worth it. We were told it would be 25-30 min and we ended up waiting for over an hour. Nothing drives me crazy like front staff incompetence. I would have definitely gone somewhere else, just not worth 2.5 hours of my night."}
{"text":"I love love love their Boom Dip!!! It is to die for!!! Every time I just want one all to myself! They also have Excellent Salads! If you are wondering whether or not to go  here.... The answer is yes!!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Chandler and went to yelp to find some good dinner for takeout. I found oreganos and I ordered their big rig pasta to go. It was amazing!!! The food was great and the people there were also very nice.  Great food and great customer service, highly recommend this oreganos!"}
{"text":"Went last Friday night with family that was in town. 18 people total!  Knowing I was bringing in a large crew, I called and spoke with Joanie, the manager, earlier in the day.  When we showed up that evening, they couldn't have been more accommodating to us.  They had a great location for us, and we got a great server.  I feel horrible I can't remember her name, but she was great!!!!  Joanie even came by a few times to check on us.  

I've been there a few other times and they never disappoint. From the atmosphere, to the service, to the food.  Always a great time!  Always worth the drive.  Even though they are opening up one close by in a few months, we'll still be coming back to Old Town!  

Thanks for everything!!!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! I enjoyed everything about it, the food, the service and the atmosphere.

It was a million degrees outside so I sat inside at the bar. Extremely friendly bartender, friendly locals sitting next to me who totally wanted me to have some of their salad and fabulous food.

I ordered the Grandma's chicken/potato/gorgonzola pizza. It was the St. Louis/flat style. It was to die for. My dining companion had a sandwich. I was told to get the deep dish cookie but, people people, there was no room for cookie. Next time. Had to send the left overs home with the friendly locals sitting next to me. Wow, were they ever so lucky to be sitting next to me that day?"}
{"text":"Oregano's is an overpriced cafeteria, and their food tastes like something served to prisons of war. Do you remember that half frozen French bread pizza you had as a child in elementary school? Well, that pizza is better than the pizza Oregano's serves so, don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"Had the chicken lasagna, and the bottom was burnt so bad I couldn't cut with my fork. Order a pizza to go more like a cheese crisp. If you enjoy Italian food, try toco bell instead of this place."}
{"text":"Phenomenal meal and selections ! For starters the garlic bread is a true garlic fans dream ! Continue to dinner for the garlic chicken lasagna. Absolutely delicious. Freshly prepared , well portioned mouth watering meal. Very pleasant and knowledgeable staff.comfortable seating and lots to look at on the walls and ceilings. Music was comfortably set. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food. Its not as heavy as the authentic italian food, its more of a light spin on the classics. Service is and has always been wonderful including the take out process. Def worth a try if your in the area, but make sure to call ahead on weekends because it gets packed"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and if you dont mind waiting hours for a table then you shoudl be fine. Service is usually great and they always make sure you go home with more then one meal. The place is very cramped and even when you finally get a table you feel like your sitting on strangers laps. If they could use some of there profit to make the place bigger with more tables then i would rate it a 5 star."}
{"text":"Ok I am not proud of this but during our recent trip to Phoenix, we ate at Oregano's.......twice......in three days. We left absolutely stuffed. The pizza is amazing but the half baked cookie with ice cream.....that is what I want my last meal to be. I only wish we lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food but awful service by our waitress while five staff stood up in a corner and chatted for over one hour. Is there a manager somewhere??"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Food quality was great and tasted amazing. The environment of the restaurant is very italy and old school and i loved it. It does get packed very fast so make sure you get in early or expect long wait times! 4 Stars was given only because our waitress wasnt very attentive with the drinks. My glass stayed empty about 10 minutes during the meal."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday afternoon and got a table right away, a nice change.  EXTREMELY frat/sorority atmosphere among the waitstaff, in that they spent a lot more time socializing with each other than dealing with patrons.  To put it bluntly, the service sucked.  Our waiter brought our drinks to us, took our order, then completely forgot about us.  When I went to find him he was deep in conversation with some dude at the bar.  Food was OK, but I would never waste my time here again and I would definitely not wait for an hour so that I could be shoved into a booth and forgotten."}
{"text":"My girlfriend was craving pasta and I've never been here before so we decided to grab dinner here. The entrance to this place is confusing. It's on the side of the building & is located outside. When we first got there we walked in the wrong door and got lost. We decided to sit inside. It's really small in there, feels kind of cramp to me. 

I ordered the big rig & she ordered Alfredo the dark. HUGE portions for such a great price. I added 2 meatballs to my big rig. The pasta was really bland, nothing a little bit of salt couldn't fix. The meatballs didn't taste homemade. It felt like they were just frozen meatballs that they heated up. The Alfredo on the other hand was really good. It had a nice smokey flavor to it. But the toast that came with the Alfredo was so burnt. Why would you put burnt unedible toast on the plate? I didn't think it would be that hard to just retoast 2 new pieces of bread. 

Service was really slow that night and it wasn't even busy. Drinks didn't get refilled. Took about 15 mins for our waiter to take our order after sitting down. Took 10 mins to get us To go boxes and get the bill. I wasn't too impressed with this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Oregano's in Old Town , Scottsdale on Tuesday at around 4:30. We were told there would be a 5 to 10 minute wait. We walked in and there were several tables that were available in the bar area. The waiter told us we need the hostess to sit us in the bar area. So in about 10 minutes she finally seated us at the table we were sitting at anyway. Then our waiter finally came back stating his was not our waiter but will be taking our drink order, we just ordered water. We order a salad we were thinking of splitting the large and ask the waiter, he stated that the salad was large enough to feed all three of us  which included him.  He then staed we should just orde two small dinner salads which would have been around 6. 50 so we opted for the large sald for 5.99. It was good and fresh and the Chipolte dressing was good and spicy. The pizza took over 45 mins thin crust we ordered half Lawrence and half Número Ono it came out Luke warm, the crust was paper thin and burnt black on the edges and skimpy toppings. My boyfriend said his side had good flavor, but I could not taste much of anything, the fresh Parmesan was a good touch. When we inquired about the pizza crust being burnt the waitress stated that it was our fault for ordering 2 different sides on the pizza, never had a problem like this at other places Grazies, or Grimaldi 's. We thought that she was rude and full of herself, we also noticed that the music was so loud we had a hard time hearing ourselves. Oregano's use to be my favorite place , but the last few times I have been there food , service is not very good, I think oregano's need to focus on good customer service and food quality control. I doubt we will be back, Grazies is still number one on our list, great food and service."}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Our waitress and bartender were attentive and concerned with our orders and happiness. The food is delicious, nicely priced and big portions. We live out of state and enjoy visiting everyone we visit."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for service. Staff is great, especially with kids. Great for out of town visitors. Salads are good, but massive. Boom dip a must. Just had the potato, rosemary and gorgonzola pizza. Very good. Brussel sprouts on menu!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would, I called 3 times to make an order for pick-up. I was put On hold 3 times and then when the girl answered she laughed at me and hung up. One of them was named Suzy. I have been a long time Oreganos fan and recommend it to everyone but stay away from this location. They are rude and never busy."}
{"text":"Quite frankly its not worth the wait. Oreganos isn't bad but by no means should anyone wait 45+ minutes for a table to eat here. If I drive in and see a mass of people sitting outside waiting for a table I keep driving. At least they expanded their parking a few years ago, that was a major plus. If it isnt busy, lol, I know its always busy, then check it out, otherwise there are many other better options in Tempe."}
{"text":"We ate her last night and it was awesome as always! I just wanted to say the staff is always exceptional as well. Last night we left our Maui Jim sunglasses on the table and just walked out on accident. Behold or waiter was such a gem, he chased after us to return the sunglasses to us! Seriously, who would do that these days!!? They we men sunglasses and this guy was an fan of the same style of sunglasses. It really struck home to me. If I couHands down the best, really struck home with me. How warm and genuine the staff is. We had the beef spicy salad (not the name of it) and a deep dish mushroom and sausage pizza and finished with a half chocolate chip and macadamia nut pizza cookie with ice cream!! So good! We get it pretty much every single time we visit!!"}
{"text":"Last time my husband and I went here the service was great! I think the recent management changes have overall made this place much better. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Visiting my son and daughter-in-law in Mesa over Christmas and we went to Oregano's to eat. It's a quaint little restaurant with a nice atmosphere. I had their traditional lasagna which is totally different from any traditional lasagna I have ever eaten in North Carolina. I will not be getting that again. But I did like the restaurant and I'll try something different next time. Our server was really good and she checked on us often.

{"text":"Service is amazing. Truly amazing. I was with my cousins and normally servers are more indifferent to groups in their teens/early twenties but not at oreganos.  The waiters were all very much on top of it and worked together so when my fork fell, someone else grabbed one for me immediately.
That being said, the food left something to be desired. The bruschetta was difficult to eat and has way too much raw garlic. The garlic bread with cheese was basically bread with a ton of cheese on top and nonexistent garlic. We got a dinner salad too which was what one would expect- lots of lettuce, a sliced tomato, boring. The pizza was ok but not great and the crust was really, really greasy. The pizzookie or whatever they call it was, however, really, really good.
And just know, it takes a while (40 minutes at around 3pm for us) for the pizza to come."}
{"text":"Love this place for pasta and pizza! When family comes to visit I always bring them here, it is close to home, has a large menu and you always leave stuffed plus enough for lunch the next day. MUST GET THE GARLIC BREAD. It is addicting and wonderful. The pizza cookie is also worth it, sign up with your email and get a free one on your birthday and first visit. Personal favorite is Mamas sausage and peppers pasta. Be aware of long wait on weekend nights and if you decide to order the deep dish that it will take 30-45 minites. Go and order BEFORE you're starving or you'll get super cranky. It is worth the wait though. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Our friendly, knowledgeable and super server made this family meal a 5-star experience. We had a thin crust and a deep dish pizza. You can play bean bag toss outside while waiting for your table. Be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THEIR STUFFED PIZZA.

This pizza is not good.  Someone who works there needs to intern for a few weeks in Chicago and learn the stuffed pizza trade. Too cheesy and my intuition says it is not a blend of cheeses (just mozz) making for a oily one-dimensional pie.  Crust is week, without flavor and cannot hold up to the amount of cheese on the pie.  Sauce is unremarkable.

If you are used to Chicago stuffed pizza (My Pie, Gino's, Lou's, Burt's etc) you will be VERY disappointed.  I hear that the thin crust is better."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch at the Mesa location on 4/11.  Spinach artichoke dip and a thin crust pizza.   When we got home we both spent the next couple of hours in the bathroom with explosive diarrhea.   Called the restaurant in between bouts, they said they would investigate and get back to me.   They called within 24 hours to tell me their investigation found nothing that should have made us sick,  but thanks for letting them know.   No offer to refund the price of the meal, no gifts cards, nada.  So if you don't mind shelling out nearly $50 bucks for so so service and mediocre pizza that will give you the runs, then this is the place for you.  Hurry to tell your friends and bon apetite!"}
{"text":"PLEASE TELL ME OREGANOS DIDN'T CHANGE THE WINGS!  We have loved the wings for 15 years.  Medium or medium gold.  The wings used to be smaller and cooked perfectly with a crisp skin.  The wings now are larger with more fat and the sauce is not the same.  What the frick?  I won't order them again if these are the new norm..."}
{"text":"This is a newer location, having taken the place that was once occupied by both an UNO pizzeria and Old Chicago. We have been here a few times since they opened and it seems to be more crowded than either of those had been in the past. 

This time, our server, Valerie, was very nice and took good care of us. We ordered two pizzas (one deep dish and another thin). Note that the deep dish pizzas are filling and may take up to 45 minutes to cook, so plan accordingly. 

Our drinks were kept full and the pizzas were very tasty. Our table of 4 had enough left over from our 2-pizza lunch to have some for dinner that night.

They have a variety of pastas and salads that I have always had good experiences with -- the salads are HUGE -- and the Golden wings are worth a try if you're into wings and want something a little different.

Tip: get the \"kick-butt garlic bread... with cheese\"

Tip2: if you join their email list, you get a free pizza cookie dessert."}
{"text":"Friday night and Oregonos seemed to be the hotspot. Parking lot was full and lines out the door.   Good thing we ordered our food to go.  It was hot fresh and ready to go.   

We ordered 
Chicken wings.  Spicy. With chips.  Chicken wings were delicious. But my gosh were they spicy.  I love all things spicy. But this was on another level.  My mouth was on fire.   Beware lol

Chips were crispy and homemade.  Delicious. 

Southwestern salad with roasted chicken was delicious.  Very good salad. 

Spaghetti and meatballs.  Meatballs were juicy and moist.  

Next time we're in az will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The restaurant hostess is the first employee to interact with arriving guests as they enter the restaurant.  Get rid of yours they do nothing to positively represent your restaurant. They are rude and don't care about your guest one bit. Let the waitress seat your guest.  Our waitress was great and the food was good. But because of your hostesses, I'll get take out next time."}
{"text":"Came into town for a conference and was looking for something delicious to eat. I fired up Yelp and ended up here at Oregano's. The food, amazing. The atmosphere, relaxed. The decor, home-y. (Think Buca Di Bepo lite) The staff is friendly and ready to offer suggestions. Phil was our server and was unbelievably friendly and helpful. He even offered us soft drinks for the road. When my girlfriend spilled it on the way out (she's so cute), he rushed to grab her another! Food, staff and atmosphere all get a 5s!"}
{"text":"Years ago I tried an Oregano's location when it first opened in Gilbert and was not impressed. This all changed a few weekends ago when my family decided to meet at this location for lunch. The menu had so many options I was torn on what to order between a pizza or a sandwich. I ended up ordering the Chicago Italian Sausage. It was huge, tasty, and easily was two meals on its own including the sides. I also must report that I loved their coleslaw which is odd because I have never liked coleslaw before. A few people at our table ordered salads and a pizza. The salads were huge and the pizza looked amazing. We had 10 people in our party total and the service was one the best I have ever experienced. Their food is amazing as well as their employees. What else is needed? I will return many times in the future."}
{"text":"Great food and a great vibe! This pizza joint never disappoints. The sausage sandwich will knock your socks off. (Don't forget to add peppers and onions.) Servers are always friendly with a great attitude. Its the little things this place does that sets it apart from the other local restaurants in the area. The wait time is a little long but its a small price we have to pay to enjoy delicious food."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza should not take 48 minutes to cook neither should angel hair pasta. When speaking to the mgr she states that is normal.... wait most pizza places can get it done in 20 minutes. Very disappointed we expected more from Oregenos"}
{"text":"The portions are GIANT and delicious. The staff is quick and friendly. I wish so badly that I didn't live in another state because I would eat here all the time!!"}
{"text":"Oregano's always a good place to check out when craving carb delights! This weekend, we were feeling pizza. At 6pm on the weekend there were lots of people there is some outdoor seating. This location is more spacious than the University location and the wait wasn't too long only ten minutes. 

We learned last time that deep dish can take 40 min to make fresh in their ovens. When waiting in line you can put in your order.  Our 12\" deep dish we decided to top with sausage, green pepper and mushrooms.
 When our Deep dish pizza in the pan was served to us it had plenty of cheese and marinara. I really enjoyed the crust in the pan (you don't  have to be shy about dipping the crust in your sauce because this pizza place is that good!) Our server was also very nice and attentive. They deserve all the stars for great food memories! We will be back to visit this location."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I've ever had.  Gotta get the cookie desserts too...zookies? skookies?  Whatever they're called, I need one.  Come to UTAH!"}
{"text":"Went in Nov of 2013 and I must admit this place is addicting! I've always wanted to try a Chicago style deep dish Pizza since I first learned about it on Travel Channel back in 2005! During visit in Phoenix some friends took me to try this place out. They swore up and down that it was good. Reason for being adamant was because I've been to other places and have been majorly disappointed by claims of being so called deep dish when in reality is was bread fluffed up with smeared tomato sauce. I can attest, none of that was evident here. Ordered a pie... LOL... PIE! Kept is simple with Pepperoni and sausage and it was amazing! I felt like every other pizza was blasphemy compared to eating this! Puts everyone else to utter shame! So if your in market for deep dish and happen to be in the city of Phoenix, this is the place! Aside from being in Pizza Heaven, service was great. Our waiter along with other staff worked as a team and made our visit enjoyable. Wait times wasn't horrible as we waited about 15 minutes on a Saturday night and mind you the place was packed. Overall, gave this place a 5 star rating, would most definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go to Oregano's all the time! We love the place! We tend to order either the meatball or Italian sandwich, thin crust pizza (because it doesnt take 45 minutes to make), gold wings, or the vino bambino salad. (just depending on our mood) The biggest upside is that the food is great! They have a wide variety of options so its easy to please everyone. The down side is if you dont get there before the rush you will wait 2 hours for a table. Now I love the food there, but I wont wait 2 hours anywhere to eat!"}
{"text":"This was fantastic.  Been trying to eat at the Flagstaff location for years but it's always too busy.  Found this location.  The Ziti was great,  ask for extra meat sauce and get it with the sausage links cut up, trust me.  The Alfredo in the dark was excellent as well. Thin crust pizza could use more sauce but still great.  

The amount of food for the money was also excellent.  Way better than some other chain Italian places.  Our waiter Jake was awesome. Be back next weekend!"}
{"text":"Been here more than a few tomes and we do enjoy the food and atmosphere. We only order pizza on the thin crust crust. Tip; never order the other crust or you will be waiting an hour to eat. Not good if you have a toddler.  Salads are great. Pizza is so delicious even if it's just a cheese. They use Wisconsin cheese only if I'm not mistaken. Anyway, great food and great service. We will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Love the vibe here, it's so kitschy & fun- reminds me of a Chicago spot. For a Monday night there was a 30 min wait for a table as they don't take reservations, a good sign at any restaurant when it's busy on a weekday! As we were waiting we enjoyed very reasonably priced wine from the bar, and they even had little pieces of pizza at the host stand while we waited for our table - cute idea & very delicious. 

We had a \"Waiter-in-training\" last night (which is always fun for me, being in the industry I like to give my waiters a hard time & test their skills/knowledge of the menu). He did a great job at keeping the dinner fun (even after initially spilling an entire glass of water on my guests)

The food we ordered was so good... and the entrees were HUGE!  So much food, wine, and a great time at Oregano's- excited to come back soon

Oh yea... and the warm cookie pizza with ice cream was the BEST cap to our dinner

Thanks Oregano's!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Oregano's since it first opened in it's original location in old town.
This time was my last...
We ordered a Big house salad, pesto bruschetta and an order of wings (we like to mix the wings of gold and medium sauces together). We told our server we would like to start with the salad and enjoy the other items as they come out.  After about 20 minutes everything we ordered came out together. We told the food runner to just remove the salad and he apologized. The wings were very small and very dry, hardly any sauce. Our server came back to check on us and we asked for some extra sauce. She brought some sauce that was straight out of the refrigerator. I asked to speak with a manager and he came over and we explained how disappointed we were and he explained that the sauce is always cold and they don't heat it because it will go bad. No other apologies, however he did comp the check.. Based on our experiemces over the years slowly declining, I think our journey with Oregano's is over."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to restaurants: Oregano's. This was our first visit to the Glendale location. 
I pride myself in my general knowledge of what to expect with the menu. Large portions. Good flavor. Knowledgeable staff. 
The good: the server was awesome. She did a good job making sure we got what we needed, wrote down the order, and was knowledgeable about the menu. 
Unfortunately the food is what merits the 3-stars. Let me just say normally this isn't the case. (Normally) we've had a service issue, not a food issue. First, the boneless wings were not that great. They were over-fried (too crispy, hard to cut with a knife even). I would say they were glorified chicken nuggets. What I liked was they came with plenty of sauce to dip, which helped cut through how tough the exterior was. Another con was the medium gold sauce was more spicy than I remember. 
Next, we shared the Big Beefstro salad. The cheese was what tasted like a shredded Provolone or even an aged motz. I didn't taste or look like the familiar cotija cheese it was supposed to be per the menu (maybe it was shredded cotija...?). Also, waaaaaay spicier than I remember (like I said we've been an Oreg fan for many years). Maybe this item has changed. In all fairness we were warned by the server that it was hot- so listen to your server if you order this item... it truly is HOT. 
Lastly, we got the Grandma G's pizza. Good flavors, but again something was off with this dish as well. I'm not sure if the chicken was not chopped as well or a little over-cooked or what, but it wasn't to the normal \"spec.\" 
The visit overall didn't turn us off forever, but for a $70 tab including tip it kind of sucked to spend that much and not feel satisfied by the meal. Service can suck, but when the food isn't good, that is harder to forgive."}
{"text":"Ordered a thin crust pizza tonight since I've heard a lot of good things about Oregano's and they're close to my office. The people I dealt with were friendly and the time I was given to pick up my pizza was accurate, I didn't have to wait at all. The pizza itself was pretty good. Nothing overwhelming but I will order from there again. Next time I'll try the pan since thin crust pizzas can be underwhelming in general."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend for my birthday ....Love the place excellent service ... Marcus make us feel so comfortable  good job Marcus ."}
{"text":"Tonight ... this place was HORRIBLE !!!  
Had 3 different wait staff ... 
We had not been sitting not 5 minutes when we were basically forced to order ... 
Ordered an appatizer ... salad and cheese bread ... the salad came out promply ... however the cheese bread did not come until AFTER the main dishes came ... and it was FREEZING cold ... could not even eat it ...
Speaking of cold ... the main dishes were cold as well when they came out ...
When something was said and the manager came over ... she made some excuse that her pasta maker tonight \"was working extremely fast\" ... and thats why we got the cold pasta before the cold bread ... 
She then offered us a free cookie due to it ... but why take it ? So it could come out hard as a rock with melted ice cream ... and still was charged for the bread and cold pasta ... 
It will be an EXTREMELY long time before we ever visit here again ... 
VERY DISAPPOINTING !!!"}
{"text":"We had a weekend visit to Phoenix to catch the Padres Spring training game in Peoria and also the Suns/Hornets game at American Airlines arena about a month ago. 

In any case, we ended up in Scottsdale on Friday afternoon and we all had decided to get something to eat. Pizza was the choice and we stopped off at Oregano's. Probably THE best choice that was made that day. The outdoor patio was the location for our afternoon meal. We had to start off with some drinks so beers and cocktails were ordered up and contemplated the menu selections while waiting. Now the food: 

Starters: Oregano's Favorite (salad) - Delicious honey vinaigrette dressing and we added some fresh Parmesan to boot. KickBUTT Garlic Bread topped with cheese and marinara on the side was actually KickASS. 

Main Course: Veggie Wedgie with Sweet potato fries (ordered by my girlfriend) ...couldn't have asked for anything better. The sandwich was quite large and the foccacia bread was a hit with her. The rest of us shared in the 18-inch pizza topped with pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs. The thin crust was amazing and crispy with the savory toppings to put it over the edge. 

Our server was nice and attentive, but our order for a pizza slice, salad, and a beer was incorrect the first time out. She made up for it by letting us keep the wrong order AND brought out the corrections. Now that is what I call customer service!! 

Added entertainment value: Seeing cars pull into the small parking lot (which holds about 7 cars max) and watching them maneuver to park and get out of the small lot. We could have sworn we were going to see a little bumper bump or similar but it never did happen. 

I wish there were one here in San Diego, but I know that if I find myself back in Arizona, I would definitely visit this place again. The pizza is flat out awesome and it was even better as a late night snack!! Definitely a can't miss dining option!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza, huge salads, nice Chicago ambience. Use the Yelp waiting list feature, as this place is jammed in peak hours"}
{"text":"I really enjoy oreganos food. They're super busy all the time so expect a wait. Well worth it. It's a great atmosphere and seriously good food."}
{"text":"I do enjoy Oregano's.

I haven't been to this location before but we recently met up with some friends for dinner and had a lovely experience.

The boom dip was pretty good and my gf and I split the carne taco pizza which was also tasty.  We finished everything off with the pizza cookie which is always a favorite.  If you haven't tried the pizza cookie, you need to do so asap.

The staff was friendly and attentive.  I would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Barbeque chicken thin crust pizza is best I've had. 18-inch costs about $24 and some change plus tip and it takes 15-20 to prepare. you can order by phone and pickup, or you can just enjoy inside, waitresses are very nice, atmosphere and seats are comfortable. enjoy"}
{"text":"I like oreganos. I like their food and pizza. I  comfortable bar and outside tables. It is not too loud, like you can hear person you want to talk. But is loud enough that other visitors couldn't eavesdrop your conversation. There is no smoking inside. Beer is pretty good as well. Prices are not bad, it usually cost me 20-30 dollars every time I go there. Oh yeah I love their Barbeque pizza


I think it is a good pass time place"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Oregano's! Been eating here for years and it's great every time. Each Oregano's has its own unique charm, including cool antique decor around the restaurant. This Oregano's has a great outdoor patio in between the two buildings which resemble old houses. If there is a wait-it's always worth waiting...and sometimes they will bring out pizza samples!
My favorites are the Pablo Picasso Salad, Big Beefstro Salad, cheese pizza, Guaca-Tony (a great spin on guacamole) and garlic bread with marinara. My husband loves the wings. The portions are always big enough to share. Trust me when I say this-share your meal and then you will have room for the Original Pizza Cookie! A family of 4 can share a pizza and an appetizer. Then finish with dessert. The prices are very reasonable. They have great kids meals too. 
Sullivan at the bar is amazing. He really has his act together and it shows. You'd think you were the only one at the bar because he is so attentive. My drink was full without having to ask. This place works for a business lunch, family dinner or date night. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Always great food and amazing service.. only reason 4 star is carry out wait time can be over an hour some evenings... the stuffed pizza is worth the 40 minute wait to cook- but typically prefer it for take out instead of waiting at the table for it... and you can never go wrong with a giant cookie and ice cream to top off your meal. One of my favorite locations!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I have tried several items and I can not figure out why people like it.  The pizza is yuck, the pasta is yuck and the only thing that I have tried here that was anything that I would ever want to order again is the garlic cheese bread with sauce.  That was fabulous!  The service was wayyyyyyyyyyyyy better than the food.  It is a successful chain so I thought I was ordering the wrong thing but I guess I just don't like it."}
{"text":"I will give the experience a FIVE because our kid had a blast. He was given pizza dough to play with while we were hanging out (last time I had to ask). We LOVE the ambiance! The decor is entertaining. The vibe is busy and the music plays at a comfortable 'loud' so we didn't have to keep our kid quiet!! Our server, Don / Donald was AMAZING!! He was super engaging and despite the fact that I'm not really into that, he was certainly the exception!! You could tell that he TRULY cared about our experience!! He is an asset to Oregano's, for sure!

I'm not crazy about the food...but we will likely go back. We had the crazy cheese bread which has been my favorite choice so far! It is super good and HUGE for only $5.00!! We ordered the shaved prime rib salad and while it is good, it just seems to us to need more substance, more ingredients or more meat. It seemed to us that the crispy onion topping was more like wimpy and greasy. We would have preferred actually crispy thin onion rings. We left most of them behind. We did really enjoy the fat free zingy dressing! I'm not at all a fan of their pizza as it is a super thin almost cracker type crust. 

They ONLY offer a slice of pizza or pasta for the kids!! No chicken strips or burgers. Our guy doesn't like pasta. One super thin crust pizza is not enough for our kid to get full!! Luckily, he ate some of our cheese bread to fill up or we would have had to order him more food! I do like that they offer a side of broccoli for kids and that was a good choice to offer at only 89 cents!!

The place was packed on on a Saturday night at 6:00!! There was a wait out the door, so apparently people enjoy the food more than we do! Lots and lots of people ordering pizza so it appears that others very much enjoy it, unlike us. 

Again, for us it was such a positive experience that we will likely go back periodically. Maybe we can find something on the menu that wows us if we keep trying!! We left satisfied but wanting it to be a bit better next time!"}
{"text":"The service was great. My waiter was very courteous, and even the owner  was kind enough to check on me to make sure my order was right. I am really glad this location had the calzones as well"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Oreganos. I occasionally get a craving for Spagheti and meatballs and this place has the best.  I love the old style Italian atmosphere.  Great place to spend an evening of dinner and drinks.  The service is excellent and it gets crazy busy.  Their pizzas are also very good.  Price is extremely affordable.  I had the Bollo pasta with meat sauce, Italian sausage and 2 huge delectable meatballs.  My wife had the eggplant pasta and our bill was just under 25 dollars. The portions are huge so be prepared too get a doggy bag!"}
{"text":"Great Chicago style and thin crust pies. Friendly  service,  but come early when the weather is mild,  or prepare to wait.  Huge guacatony is the perfect app while waiting for the deep dish to cook. It's summer and slower. ..so no long lines right now."}
{"text":"Finally made it here tonight after passing by the Scottsdale and Tempe locations on various occasions and commenting on how neat it looked.. Definitely very satisfied with our first of many visits to come.

We arrived around 8 pm on a Wednesday night and were surprised to find a wait.. Not a problem though as we found a spot at the bar to post up at. I ordered the Monosso Chianti while my fiancé ordered four peaks 8th ave. Coming from a wine snob, the wine was very reasonably priced for the quality of taste.

Our table was on the patio.. It was bit chilly outside but they also had the a/c blasting inside.. A lose/lose scenario for a cold-sensitive person such as myself. I requested the outside heater above our table to be turned on..Within about 5 minutes, the heater was running and we actually ended up being way more comfortable and warm than we were waiting inside at the bar under the a/c. I really appreciated the quickness of service in that regard!

I ordered the Kale Caesar salad while my fiancé ordered the chicken parm. My one complaint isn't even a true complaint but rather a personal preference and suggestion.. The size of my salad was so large it was falling off my plate. It took some serious work to eat from it and not make an absolute mess. I get that some restaurants go for the \"shock and awe\" of large portions, but it was a bit frustrating to eat and I wished that it had been placed within a bowl. Otherwise, everything was absolutely delicious and the service was great. 

Busy spot - Even late on a week night! As my fiancé always says.. \"All those people can't be wrong\" 

Superb pricing for great food and atmosphere - We loved the interior and exterior decor. It has a great retro 50's vibe complete with old movies playing on old styled tvs.

Can't wait to revisit! Thank you Oregano's!"}
{"text":"Yes, there are long lines at dinner time, and yes, it gets loud and busy - the place is hoppin', that's for sure. But Cody and Schuyler at the bar made sure we got the *best* *service* *ever*. You can usually snag a seat or at least standing room at the bar if it's busy - and these guys will take great care of you. (Even though I screwed up my order through a silly miscommunication - the guys made sure I got what I really wanted. That Fancy Dancy mushroom pizza cannot be beat.)  Thanks Schuyler!"}
{"text":"We always have a blast at Oregano's! Alfredo the Dark is a fav and is great with added chicken. The chicken wings in the gold sauce are yummy. My hubby is a Chicago native and says the deep dish or stuffed pizza is the closest thing to real Chicago style pizza he's had in Az!

If you want to have a good time in a really chill atmosphere this is a great place to be!"}
{"text":"Our first time at this location. Very impressed! Wait staff was very welcoming. The manager checked on us often and was very accessible. We beat the early afternoon crowd so we got a table right away. When we left there was a group waiting. First time having their thin crust pizza. It was great. Just the right amount of toppings. Good flavor and great crust! The zucchini sticks were hot and good! We will return to this location."}
{"text":"you cannot call this Chicago style pizza by polluting it with hot spicy sausage....the same sausage you used in your lasagna......mild, sweet Italian sausage is the prescribed and accepted method.....dump that horrible stuff you use,  and all is well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in to eat on a Friday night, which is always a chaotic time at oreganos. We chose to eat at the bar and ordered drinks and a very modified pizza (being previous employees at another location and regulars!). Our pizza did not come out as we asked, which was completely okay because I'm a diva and it was an annoying order, but Mika ensured that we were taken care of. She brought out garlic bread for me while we waited and the manager ensured we were served the pizza we wanted. I always recommend oreganos to my friends but will certainly continue to recommend the camelback oreganos from here on out."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza was ok, nothing to die over. I would have ordered the deep dish however I was so hungry and they warned us that it would take 45-50 minutes to cook. Waitress offered us several beer samples, that was nice. Beer selection wasn't great though. There has to be better pizza in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years with the family. This is a pretty cool location where they have lots of outdoor seating as well as outdoor entertainment to keep the kids busy while you wait. They have a good atmosphere and I very much enjoy going there. But there are tons of pizza places around and this one is just in the pretty good category. I like how all of the appetizers are Pizza style like Italian nachos and huge chunks of guacamole that you literally have your own pizza bread to dip in. Good service but you can definitely wait a while on evenings considering it's in a small touristy town."}
{"text":"I love this place! Been to a few different locations and the pizza is always excellent. Yesterday, my boyfriend stopped by the Camelback and 10th St. location and picked up pizzas to take home (he called in advance, as the pan pizza takes at least 30 min). I had a veggie, tomato, basil, garlic, and he had a meat combo-pepp and sausage. So delicious. The only complaint he had was the parking situation there. It is kind of tough, but well worth it. I absolutely recommend Oregano's!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch with some friends!

Didn't have a big appetite at the time so the lunch Menu was perfect.

The slice of pepperoni pizza for $3.89 good of choice for me.

It actually a really big slice, cut in half.

Can't beat that deal!"}
{"text":"Solid Salads and Pizza served by mostly hot young girls wearing tight shorts. Not sure how you can really go wrong. No wonder all the Mormon dads choose it as #1. (that was a joke about how horny mormons are)
 
Everything other than the pizza and salad here almost always dissapoints. Including the following which we have now tried on various occasions and its been quite unremarkable: Wings, Deep Dish, MEatballs, Pasta dishes, Appetizers

If you go here for the thin crust pizza and a pizookie you will be happy. Oh yea, solid beers on tap too."}
{"text":"Food, cleanliness, service,attitude, were all great! My wife and I visiting from Buffalo NY where pizza and spinach artichoke dips are to die for. Oregano's pizza and artichoke dips are very delicious! We are going back to Oregano's before we leave for home. Great job!!"}
{"text":"Great service, skimpy on the red gravy and the web site is the worst. Love the Chinese fortune cookies at the front but that web site are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Always very satisfied when I come here.  Great friendly and speedy service, best to come during non-peak hours as there is often a crowd waiting. They have a nice beer selection which I appreciate, great Italian style menu selection, and good atmosphere.  No complaints here!

Dishes I highly recommend: ALL OF THEM!"}
{"text":"What a super great place to eat! We went here after a visit to D.B.G. and we were starving. Luckily, we only had about a 20 minutes wait for a table. This place was packed. We got a great table on the patio. I loved the outdoor patio, plus those huge over head heaters kept us toast warm. Our server Heather was very perky and fun and friendly. We had food envy, checking out other people's tables to check out their food. Everything looked \"huge\" and yummy! 

We had the Big Rig Pasta and the Pasta Basta. The Big Rig was super yummy rigatoni covered with the best tomato-chipotle cream sauce. I loved it so much!!! Basta was penne, feta cheese, kalamata olives, pine nuts, and sun-dried tomatoes. These yummy dishes were both less than $9 and enough to eat for a couple days. B. J. really wanted to try the lasagna, but they warn you right on the menu that they take extra time and we couldn't wait! 

For dessert, we couldn't pass up on trying a pizza cookie. We picked the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut. It was SO good.  Who doesn't like a freshly baked hot, hot cookie topped with ice cream?  Oh, yum! 

The food here is very delicious and the atmosphere is very fun. I love Oregano's!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Came here from out of town and was blown away. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"My go to pizzeria in Phoenix. Reminds me of Lou Malnatis deep dish pie in Chicago. They use quality ingredients."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant now!!!  Everyone goes out of their way to welcome you with and enthusiastic smile! Food is fantastic with huge servings!  Yum-yum!  Chelsea, our waitress was a great waitress and went out of her way to make sure our needs were met!  They served our pizza but it wasn't exactly like we ordered so a different waitress who served the pizza  (sorry I didn't get her name) said we could munch on the pizza and they would make us a new one!  Then Roy the manager came out and apologized and said the kitchen was rushed and misread it. He said he would have a new one made for us right away and would box up the other one for us. Roy was a fantastic manger and excels in customer service.   Thank you Roy and Chelsie for above and beyond service!"}
{"text":"I love Oreganos! I work here and I know it may seem cliché to say I love everything about this place but I honestly do! My coworkers are the best, the food is DELICIOUS and the environment is uplifting and fun. I LOVE Oreganos and if you're a little iffy about trying it, I promise you will love it :)"}
{"text":"Best location of the bunch! Biggest store and friendliest staff! The good thing is they still have the same amazing food as all of the other locations. The wait may be long in the beginning but they always make the wait worth it! So happy that the west valley can finally enjoy their food."}
{"text":"We had the Chicago Stuffed Crust with pineapple and sausage. It was AWESOME!  The serving staff was excellent and just the right amount of attentive. My wife wanted to get one of the staff shits - \"Legalize Marinara\". We wanted to sit inside on a Friday night so it did take a bit to get seated."}
{"text":"Oregano's is always been one of my favorite pizza restaurants. As many of you know the wait lines can be very long. What has impressed me the last two times we were there, was that the hosts worked extremely hard to get us seated ASAP. I hadn't even received my drink order from the bar when the host came and got me and said they could seat me outside at a larger table. They showed me the table and asked if it was okay. We said yes. Then they sat another couple at the same table with us. It was a community table. How fun. We enjoyed the conversation with our new friends. The service was extremely fast and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. besides always having great food, the service was exceptional. That's why they get five stars is exceptional service."}
{"text":"I have been taking out of town guests/business associates here for their thin crust pizza and great salads! It is always a big hit and very reasonable. The biggest downside to this place is the wait but if you are in the mood to hang out at the bar and drink some chianti or a nice draft beer, the wait is not that long!
Favorite dishes: Bistro Classic pizza! This is a delicious White pizza, brushed with garlic butter, topped with roma tomatoes, diced red onion, thinly sliced basil, and four Italian cheeses. Yummy! It reminds me more of a margherita pizza and it is delicious!
Oregano's Favorite Salad: Romaine lettuce, sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives,  spiced feta cheese, roasted red peppers, (hold the) red onions, pine nuts and raisins tossed with our tasty honey vinaigrette dressing.
For Dessert! HAve the pizza-cookie (used to be called a pazookie)! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Visiting from New York and found this local Arizona gem. Great thin crust pizza and huge delicious salads. Sitting at the bar to eat was fun. The bartenders were friendly and treated us like locals. Service was awesome. Can't wait to go back. Who would have thought we'd find NY quality pizza out west. Other foods coming out of kitchen also looked wonderful."}
{"text":"Update:  We tried this location a couple of years ago and it was just OK. We went back this week and everything was fantastic! Our server Cody did a great job taking care of us. We had a Cesar salad, cheese garlic bread, stuffed mushroom ravioli and a thin crust veggie pizza. EVERYTHING was perfect and made just right! Amazing and complete opposite of our last experience. Forgot to mention the pizookie (freshly baked chocolate cookie and a mini pizza pan with your choice of ice cream scooped on top with syrup and fresh whipped cream :):):):) DELICIOUS!





Previous Review: We took out of town guests here tonight for drinks and dinner. While we were waiting for our table, our bartender Natalie started making our drinks and left them half made and took care of other customers. Pouring their drinks and taking their food order. After 10 minutes of our drinks sitting on the back counter, we were called to our table in the dining room. Natalie seemed to have forgotten about our half poured drinks :( and we asked her to just cancel our order. Food was average tonight and some of our appetizers were not hot but warm."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great family restaurant with excellent Chicago pizza, look no further than Oregano's.

Being a Chicago native, I am always looking for good authentic Windy City pizza. Oregano's has it! Whether you like my favorite thin crust, or traditional stuffed deep dish, this place has you covered.

We had the thin crust and it was very good. Cheese and sausage werve stellar. Only draw back was the crust. While it was good, it was a tad under cooked with no cornmeal on the bottom. That's the only reason I didn't rate it five stars.

They also have giant, dirt-cheap kids meals including pasta. My kids loved it and it's great for families on a budget.

Make sure you save room for dessert. Oregano's warm chocolate chip cookie dough served hot with vanilla bean ice cream, and chocolate chips, is one of the best desserts we've ever had.

Service was hands-down perfect from the entire staff. Jordan was our server and was attentive, friendly and did an excellent job

Whenever we're in Scottsdale, we'll be back to Oregano's. Great food, great people and great prices."}

We will be coming back here often. If you are looking for a great place to eat, with an awesome atmosphere, this is the place."}
{"text":"What what,,, years,,, I mean YEARS about seeing this place and deciding,, eh too busy and no place is worth that kind of wait.. even friends of ours said it was ehh ok,, as their fave is bucca de bepo.... But ok, finally been here and WILL be a regular.. 

Pizza was very good, fresh ingredients,, Not a top 5 pizza, but for casual dining with family, it does the trick.. Now the Pasta,,, the Mushroom whatever Pasta was BA // So great, i took the wife a couple days later and she loved it too.. There is NEVER leftover when we go now.. We just have to find time to try other items..."}
{"text":"This place is one of our faves... we live for the big rig pasta. Sooo good.  Second time now we ended up with the server Jenna.  She is amazing, she makes our experience even better and our daughter loves her.    Thank you.    thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hand down my favorite Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. I love the shrimp diablo pasta and the beef-tro salad. The portion is big enough with reasonable price. The thin crust pizza is another favorite, but it can takes long to order. That's the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Overall, the place worth the price and wait."}
{"text":"I've visited the Oreganos on 67th & Bell a hand full of times for lunch and dinner and I must say that you can't beat the value of the midway rush special from 11-3 M-F. I enjoy the chicken caesar and the many flavorful toppings on their famous pizza! The staff is friendly and the best server in my opinion is Kelly. She truly knows how to make Oreganos an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"I was a first-timer and went with a local from Phoenix. I give the Guaca-tony an exuberant 5. Tried a pizza and another pasta dish which I give a 3. The service was amazing even though it was a busy Saturday evening, so that makes a 4 in my book. Definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. Fast and friendly service. Generous portion sizes. They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal and good service. While we waited the service extended to waiting guests with complimentary garlic bread. Just beware of the El Diablo dish it is fire  . But tasty"}
{"text":"The food is good, very heavy, not many salad options. I have had there meatball sandwich and there calzone. There calzone does well even on the second day. The staff was as quick as possible, area was clean. Overall i'd return if that is where everyone wants to go."}
{"text":"Visited last Saturday. I had heard the pizza was really good. Originally from the Chicagoland area, I am always looking for a great pizza to remind me of home. Well I wasn't disappointed. The deep dish was so good. Perfect crust, and right amount of goodies.

 I didn't mind the wait for the pizza as other reviewers, as I know a good Chicago deep dish takes time to cook.

Only reason I didn't give the fifth star was for the wait to be seated, no call ahead or reservations. 

Can't wait to go back, just have to be prepared for the wait to be seated and sitting in the hot sun since there is no covering over the outside wait area."}
{"text":"Super annoyed with this place. I ordered for pickup a pesto pizza with chicken and artichoke and they put tomatoes on the top of it even though I didn't order them. They said that's the way pesto pizzas come and said I could wait for another one. Now I'm stuck with a pizza we didn't order and they wanted me to stay an extra 30 minutes to get the pizza we ordered. No thanks. Why not just listen to what people order instead of taking the liberty to add things to pizzas when people don't order it that way. Save yourself some dang tomatoes."}
{"text":"I really don't like giving low reviews but this place is just... not good. And the service is sloooooooooooooow. 

On this dinner visit we walked in and were promptly seated. Our waitress greeted us after a couple of minutes and was super friendly. We already knew what we wanted to order and she advised me the o'zone takes about 20 minutes. I was cool with that so we proceeded with our order. Then it all kind of went downhill. We waited much much longer than 20 minutes. Tables came and left in the time it took for us to receive our meal and pay quickly after. 

Our waitress was doing the best she could. She was constantly running from table to table and did check in on us, thanking us for our patience. She was clearly texting her best but it was a pretty steady night. The thing is, every time I've been dragged in here it's been the same situation. 

The reason this review goes to a two.. the food. It's not even that good. I'm sorry, I've tried to like it, I really have, but it's all pretty blah and never sits well with me either. With many other chain Italian restaurants around, this place just doesn't stand out."}
{"text":"Over an hour wait- asked for a comp- they comped my dish only not the table (we all waited more than an hour). The lime parm wings gave me diarrhea (literally- very soon after eating them). Their food is mediocre and the wait is not just bad it is way beyond reasonable. It should be VERY easy to find a better Italian place. I am suspicious of these 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"Food is great every time along with excellent customer service. Everyone is so enviting, polite, and prompt. I mainly go there for a one of a kind pizza, the BBQ chicken is a good choice it's my favorite, the spinach artichoke dip is to die for with the garlic bread, and of course the famous cookie pizza with a choice of any cookie."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group (6 adults and 6 kids).  We ordered the wings, the Big Beefstro salad, the Pizza cookie and 4 pies.  Three pies were thin crust and the fourth pie was Chicago styled pizza.
The wings were the typical, but still good, wings you get in any decent pizza or bar.  The Big Beefstro salad was fantastic.  If you like a kick in your salad with hearty amounts of ribeye, I would highly recommend this.  It's the perfect mix of beef, sweet and spicy.
The thin crust pizzas were terrific - crunchy and very flavorful.  However, the Chicago style pizza was undercooked; thus it was doughy.  And we lived in Chicago and know what decent Chicago style should be.
The kids loved the Pizza cookie and devoured that in no time.
I thought this was a great place to get good pie and hang out with a big group.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is awful. An hour and half wait after the hostesses didn't enter in my contact information when put on the waiting list. Patio is disgusting. Roaches are everywhere, tables are sticky, misters make it like sitting underneath a shower. Not to mention, on top of the hour and half wait is another hour wait for pizza. Find a different pizza place for this mediocre restaurant!"}
{"text":"We have our weekly meeting here. Can't skip a week. The food is yummy. I've taken kids too and they love it! They give them pizza dough to play with. Kept them busy while we waited for food. My fav is deep dish, but my boss has me hooked on think crust too. The salads are huge so prob should share. I get the small they call big. They're not kidding... I've never made a dent in it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Oregano's locations around the valley, every time is a great time and great food! Some of these \"complaints\" I just don't understand. The staff is always so friendly. I feel like some of these reviews are just unhappy picky people who will never be pleased, and will pick apart anything to find a reason to complain."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to go here because the one in Denver was supposedly wonderful.  I was not impressed with the food at all.   The wait staff was nice.  The restaurant was just \"okay.\"  It wasn't horrible, but not good enough to eat there again.  Save your money and go to Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Super fast service and I love the misters outside! Wish the hostess area was inside especially in the hot Arizona heat. The waiting area for a table outside is a little tad bit too small especially when it's over 100 degrees and theres a bunch of other people waiting for a table. Love all their pasta here, service is super fast and all of the employees are all super nice and always have a smile on their face. The Pizookies here are to die for! Every time I come here I make sure I get one!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Especially because it is so close to my house! The service was alright when I went here, the waitress was nice and always was checking up on us to see if our food was good or if we needed anything else. The service for getting the food out was a little on the slow side which sucked because I was starving the whole time I had to wait for the food to come out! The misters are nice on the outside eating area especially in the heat of Arizona. Parking lot is huge since it is in the complex as same as Paradise Valley Mall."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant. We got the guaca-tony and it was amazing. It was really good guacamole served with super thin cheese crisps. Hard to describe but it was really good. I had the Alfredo After Dark. It was fine, I probably wouldn't get it again. I had a side of  sausage which was okay but I prefer the meatballs. My husband had the Shrimp Diablo which he liked (he said it was super spicy). For dessert we had the pizza cookie which was the best thing I have ever tasted. I could eat that pizza cookie every day for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"First time trying this place since moving from California.  We came on a Friday night and the wait was an hour and 30mins. Was a little disappointed but since it was our first time there we decided to stick out the long wait.  While we were waiting they brought out samples of cheese pizza which were fresh out of the oven and super yummy.  After being there for 40 mins they sat us down.  We wanted to try everything since it was our first time there. We ordered the garlic cheese bread, hot wings, antipasto salad, italian wedding soup, bbq chicken pizza, and the margharita pizza! Everything we ordered was soooo good. The salad was so refreshing. The garlic cheese bread was delicious!  The pizza was cooked perfect.  We got the thin crust and it was so tasty. We finished this meal off with the cookie pizza! It was better then the famous pazookie from BJs. This place was excellent!  We wil be back but probaly order take out if it's a weekend night."}
{"text":"Oregano's is the Bomb

When I posted that I was going to Oregano's for the first time, the post above was one of several very positive recommendations so I was encouraged...and fortunately.

From the very beginning, the staff was very friendly and attentive.

I had their thin crust pizza with tomatoes on top (forgot the name) which was excellent... a big deal coming from a NY pizza snob. Then my guest and I shared a delicious, giant and warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.

Our waitress was first class and even made sure our giant to go cups were filled to the top before we left.

I will be back with family, friends and business partners soon"}
{"text":"First time at this location. Brought in a baseball team and families. Total of 30 people at 430pm on a Saturday. Got all of us seated within 30 minutes on three tables. Service was outstanding and food was really good."}
{"text":"Cool place but holy smokes it's extremely slow service. Slow waiters and the kitchen is extremely slow."}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is awful. 30 minutes to get seated and 50 minutes for a pan pizza and 20 minutes to get a bill. Good luck. If you have all night it's a great place to go. If you're hungry right now don't go here!!!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving 4 stars not 5 because of the long wait for a table. Had family in town from Oregon and they wanted Italian food. We suggested Oregano's because it is a family friendly place with a great variety on the menu. We try to order different things and have yet to be disappointed! We love the gold wings and of course the pizza cookie!"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent salads (Pablo Picazzo) and service plus reasonable prices are a winner in my book. Sometimes there are waiters who are eye candy and that is a nice feature ! 

Tip: Go early at lunch time...it is a lot less busy than dinner time when you can often expect lines."}
{"text":"The take our server told us 35 minutes and when we arrived 5 minutes early she said it was actually an hour. She the accidentally gave our wings to the customer in front of us. We ordered a cold salad and wings. Yikes! Take out could use some refinements since busy is always standard so that is no excuse."}
{"text":"Excellent service, outstanding food and quality ingredients, will definitely be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"This place was great! We were referred by some friends to try it and so glad that we did. We went on a Friday night so there was about a 45 minute wait. Luckily for us, their waiting area was more like an outdoor lounge. We were able grab a drink at the bar and sit outside while we waited for our table. The wait actually went by pretty fast as we didn't even get to finish our drink before being seated. 

The waiter was great and super helpful. We got the antipasto salad to start, it was HUGE. We felt like we ate so much of it and it barely made a dent! Since we both like different pizzas, we were able to get half of each kind and they were both fabulous. We had the bbq chicken and the meat trio. Delish! We will definitely be back when we return to the Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"The wait is the only thing I hate. But it must be good food if you have to wait. We came in 8 deep and our waiter was nice and accommodating to my big loud family. We ordered sooo much food and I can everything was top notch."}
{"text":"Don't come here on a Friday night it's like a Olive Garden on Mother's Day  worst part is their waitlist time on yelp is completely inaccurate.
Joined the waitlist 30 min prior to arriving expecting a 10 min wait only to be crammed in a tight space like a heard of cattle and told the wait would be at least 30 min. Oregano's as a whole is descent but wouldn't recommend this location unless you don't care about waiting forever."}
{"text":"Disappointing,  ordered sausage pizza slice 1visit, excellent. Today, 2 slices, warm not hot on tin plate, burnt crust, no tomato sauce, stingy on cheese and thin slices of sausage falling off. Never again. Didn't complain because friend invited me and was paying, but never again."}
{"text":"This place is soo good! Authentic Italian at its finest and affordable prices to go with it! The bruschetta is a must have! The servings are literally ginormous so we had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day. Our server, Drew, was so sweet and attentive but not over bearing. We sat on the patio for dinner and it was beautiful. The misters were even perfect because they actually cooled you off but didn't soak you and spray in your face like some other places. Loved our time here."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, I have always hated Olive Garden and thought I finally found a place that would be a good replacement. The first time I came here was amazing I had not one complaint. The second, third and forth time was a whole different story. From the time I walked in I started getting dirty looks  almost a if I was a burden for them that I walked in. Once I was seated which took longer then needed given how slow it was, next we had the pleasure of waiting 10 mins before anyone even came in the direction of our table. When she decided to come she mentioned that they forgot about us, another 15 mins to get water, another 20 mins to get our appetizer(which was the wrong food), another 15 min to take our food order, another 20 mins to get our food, of which we had no silverware to eat the said food. I had to get up and find my own. Moral of story go to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"3 stars solely on Loudness; details in body.
Daughter loves Oregano's,  we don't even have to look at the menu as we know our order by memory. So we came in between Dorm shopping stores, and got our favs.
Location;  Very easy to find, parking little odd as actually location only has handful so you park in rear of restaurant. 
Restaurant;  Now we have been to this location many times and were seated on the east end of the restaurant that looks to be an add on and can convert into a more open patio once cooler. Oddly not sure if amount of people caused this, but the echo was extremely loud. The worst part was when the bus staff was cleaning tables and moving chairs, the chairs were dragged back under the table creating the loudest noise ever, at one point a large party was being set up and they moved tables and chairs to make a large table, the noise was so loud lost track of conversation and my entire table was startled. 
Food;  Food always on point; Alfredo the Dark with chicken is the best dish and my ultimate favorite.  The Boom dip is a must try and don't forget the dessert. YUMMY
Service;  Our service was amazing, she was so friendly and always making sure we were ok.
Will go again, but will never sit in same area again."}
{"text":"Yum! Really great tasting pizza! My friend introduced me to the Grandma G's and I will not order any other pizza again! This was so delicious that I can't put enough \"yums\" to it. It's a thin crust pizza with chicken, gorgonzola and havarti cheeses, roma tomatoes, rosemary, caramelized onions, and sliced potatoes...oh yes I said potatoes. Fantabulous! 4 day later I went back and took the hubby and ordered the same exact thing. haha!

I've taken the fam here before too and we had the typical \"everything\" pizza and also have tried their pasta which was good too. But if you're coming here, you've got to get the Grandma G's 18 inch and get a large house salad with their chipotle ranch dressing. Also you've got to try the calamari because that is delicious too! They are perfectly cooked, lightly breaded (so you can actually taste the squid) and it compliments both the pizza and the salad.

My friend said \"I will never leave Arizona because of this one pizza!\" You know...I probably would agree with her. Just try it =)

NOTE: Be prepared to wait if you're coming in for dinner, even if you think you're coming for an early one. The wait can be daunting and discouraging, so I would suggest you either call for a pick-up or go for a late lunch (maybe around 1-ish or 2). At least try this place once...you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Really looking forward to a pizza splurge! The restaurant smells like stale beer so I opted to sit at the bar outside. Ordered the simple salad and Mexigano thin slice. Salad was difficult to eat. The lettuce pieces were giant and the vegetables not bite size. Pizza was very good. The only good thing about the visit. Service was terrible. It took a long time to order even though there were only 3 other bar guests and 2 bartenders. I had to help myself to a plate and silverware. Good thing they were within reach. No one asked how my food was. No water refill. My cup sat empty next to my plate for 12 minutes. I finally asked someone dropping off a dirty glass for a box. Still no acknowledgment from the bartenders, offer of a dessert or a check. The man across the bar was twirling his credit card and his date finally asked for their check. Another 6 minutes go by. I ask for a check and am ignored. I give up. Threw cash on the bar to cover the food and tax. Next time I'll get takeout."}
{"text":"FOOD IS AMAZING!!!! 

Obviously you can't go wrong with their food, that's definitely never the issue. My boyfriend and I LOVE this place and have only been disappointed with their food once.

I usually have OK service (have never had great customer service here) but the last time I visited I was sooooo disappointed. 

We only get a 30min lunch break at my job, so we are always looking for places that will allow us to order take-out. Two weeks ago it was my friend's last day, and we wanted to go out to lunch as a group to wish her well and to spend time away from the office for lunch. My co-worker called this location a couple hours before we planned to eat to see if we could place our order ahead of time, but eat there and order drinks with a server. (We obviously planned to tip the server for our food purchase as well) Even though the girl said that would be fine over the phone, it was a nightmare when we got there. 

We were scolded by some blonde woman (I'm assuming a manager?) because they \"don't normally do this\", even though we were ok'd by the girl who took our orders over the phone. Everyone treated us terribly as if we were being high maintenance, even though we were advised by the staff that this would be ok. We were not trying to make trouble for anyone, and were treated poorly because of the new girl's mistake. Not to mention she tried to close us out ahead of time, even though the bartender advised her that she should not \"close us out\"; to which she said \"I'm not closing them out, I'm having them pay for it.\" (Clearly she was brand new to the industry).

5 stars for food but the service at this location is terribleeeee! Such a shame."}
{"text":"I live near this establishment and have enjoyed their food from time to time but unfortunately the service is poor nearly every time I have been there. Don't get me wrong, the actual servers have been good. But the lack of organization and courteous service that one would expect from the manager is solely lacking. Our family, a rather large group had checked in about 2hrs before even some of us began to be seated. The front entry was packed with customers as some of us held our small children in arms. As more time passed people kept being seated ahead of us with no consideration from the manager even letting us know when the rest of us could be seated, we were just ignored. So I asked the manager if we were going to be seated anytime soon, with total frustration she gave us \"the look\" and said \"well you told us six for this party and it turns out to now be only four and that's not our fault\". So we ended up in a seating area the establishment refers to as \"no mans land\" and had to listen to the manager politely apologizing to the couple next to us for their long wait while she offered them a cold drink and an appetizer on the house. Well...I don't know exactly what we did, but she sure made it seem as if we were not wanted in her establishment. My advice to the management is, if you can't deal with the pressure don't take it out on the patrons."}
{"text":"Oregano's Shmeragono's... the juggernaut Italian restaurant chain in Phoenix has people waiting in line seven days a week. Must be amazing?! Must be soooo tastey?! Must have fantastic service and ambience?! No. No. And no. Most of the staff is definitely professional, speedy and fun. My take out gal the other day \"scolded\" me for arriving too early. 
\"I said 25 minutes...whyd you get here too early?\"
\"To spend time with you, you prickly ass pear\"
Anyway I hung out and waited my full alloted time. No biggie. I ordered 3 apps and 1 medium pizza. 
\"That'll be $47 dollars please.\" says miss prickly ass pear.
I  arrive home to my $22 medium BBQ pizza. Thin crust. Nice sauce. Tastey all around. The stuffed mushrooms. Not so great. More salt then Salt Lake City. And at least a pound of crumbled Italian sausage. Portabellos were too slimy. Like bad canned fruit. Garlic cheese bread...well, come on how can you screw that up. My dog can make garlice bread (and it's not bad by the way). 
All in all. I'd rather get take out than sit inside at this location. Not a big fan of the cluttered look. There are pictures and knick knack crap everywhere. It looks like an Italian flea market threw up everywhere!"}
{"text":"They have Chicago style deep dish pizza and garlic bread that is at least three feet long. How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Ordered for take out and the time quoted was exact. The pizza was hot even by the time we got home. The thin crust is my personally favorite and the antipasto salad is a must! Amazing customer service and nothing but the best food from this restaurant."}
{"text":"The brusehetta is great. I went to Italy a few years ago and this is the best I have had sense.  The beer is cold and reasonable priced."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't, love everything about this place, but I do.

That's why I have to show restraint and not eat here as often as I'd like; because if I did, I'd weigh a lot more than I already do. 

When you walk up to be seated, you're sure to be greeted with friendly smile.  In fact, if a waiter happens to walk by with a tray full of food, he'll probably say hello too.  Even the bartender might wave to you.  Obviously, the management here places a huge emphasis on attentive service in a friendly environment.  The wait staff wears t-shirts with clever sayings on the back, such as \"Legalize Marinara\" and \"Size Matters.\"

You have a choice whether to sit inside our on the patio.  If the weather is good, I opt for the patio.   It has more action and great people watching.

The menu is insane and offers too much temptation.  Anything I've ever eaten here has been great.  So I'll focus on my favorites.  My favorite appetizer is the stuffed mushrooms, filled with Italian sausage and covered with marinara sauce and cheese.  My favorite salad is the Pablo Picasso: Romaine lettuce with fajita chicken, cheese, tomatoes, onion and cilantro, then topped with tortilla strips.  The dressing is some sort of spicy jalapeno dressing.  The best pizza, in my opinion of course, is their Double Stuffed, like a deep dish pizza on steroids.  It takes 40 minutes to bake, so sit back and enjoy a couple of beers and wait for the grand entrance of your crusty cheesy tomato treasure.  Not that you'll have any more room in your tummy, but if you do, go for their Pizza Cookie.  It's a half pound of chocolate chip cookie dough, slightly baked and then topped with ice cream.  

Try to visit Oregano's at \"off times\" so the wait will be shorter.  When it's busy, the wait time can be more than one hour.  But if it is, a server is likely to come out to the waiting area and serve you nibbles of thin crust pizza.  Is this place a slice of heaven, or what?"}
{"text":"Only giving it 4 stars because of the wait. The wait can be ridiculous but the food is delicious! Their wings are awesome (which I didn't expect) and their spinach dip is the best! Absolutely love their food."}
{"text":"+ Great /Large Menu
+ Good Food
+ Very Large Portions (I always like to take some home)
+ Surprisingly good prices
+ Good place for family and friends
+ Cute waitresses

---

- Can get busy w/wait times (but NYPD Pizza is right next door if you cant wait)
- Small place. They should buy the building next to it and expand, people cant seem to get enough of Oregano's but they are always a bit small inside. Even cramped. 
- Long cook times (upwards to 50 minutes) but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"My sister has it right. This is like the dutch bros of italian foods. I feel like the joy is forced and they probably all hate working there, what a damper on the mood. All we ordered was a pazookie and it took like 20 mins to get it lol. People after us got their food. 

They probably just had a busy day, but this was our experience. Also, who's architectural genius was it to have just two bar stools facing the open crowd loft style??

This is weird."}
{"text":"Wow...waited over an hour for our pizza to come. Granted - they took care of our appetizer and a dessert, but a small credit doesn't mean much. It's really loud inside, has a weird smell and the food is only decent. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wow. I love this place. #1 the staff is GREAT! They are always so nice and attentive. 

#2 the food is always good! The first time I had it, I thought it was a small family owned restaurant. I was blown away when I found out there were more. 

I'm vegetarian and I have got the eggplant parmigiana, SO good. 
Also, the big rig pasta! Delicious!
And even the simple Bowl O' Pasta. That was good as well!

Eat here!"}
{"text":"Mediocre dinner salad with warm, un-appealing dressing. Entree salad was fair. Shrimp diablo was too hot. I love spices food but this was ridiculous. Starchy cream sauce with only three or four shrimp. No bargains here on lunch entree costs. Choose another restaurant if you truly love Italian food."}
{"text":"I've been aching for Oregano's to come to Surprise just so I could have tasteless brussel sprouts and oily mac and cheese!...said no one ever.

Oregano's first graced my tongue 14 years ago when I was inducted to its awesomeness in Scottsdale.  Since that day, I went to several locations all over the Phoenix metro area, and have always had a stellar yummy in my tummy experience.

So imagine my excitement when I found out an Oregano's was opening just 3 minutes away from my house.  It was like the clouds parted and angels singing above me.  I know enough not to rate a place when it first opens...I didn't even want to go until they had time to work out the kinks because I didn't want to ruin the ghosts of Oregano's past.  So when the decision was made last week to FINALLY go, I was rubbing my hands in anticipation fast enough to start a campfire without flint.

My meal mate ordered the roasted Brussel Sprouts and Mom's Mac and Cheese. The brussel sprouts smelled amazing.  Even more amazing was apparently it comes unsalted.  At all.  And without flavor.  I usually find it sacrilegious to use a salt shaker on food and can probably count on one hand the times I've ever had to use one.  I am accustomed to food with little salt.  But this time I had to wipe away a tear as I reached for the salt shaker cheering on the sidelines.  The positive note is it did make the dish edible.  Unfortunately the Mac and Cheese had no such knight in shining armor.  I need a whole paragraph for this one.

When you think of Mac and Cheese, you think of an ooey gooey sinfully luscious cheesegasmic experience.  Am I right?  Why else would you get mac and cheese?  Oregano's menu sells it like this:  \"Mom makes hers with spiral pasta, Alfredo sauce, cheddar cheese, chipotle pesto and topped with cotija cheese, bread crumbs and baked in a skillet.\"  I took the liberty of rewriting the description to more accurately describe the dish for any of you thinking of ordering it.  \"Mom makes hers with spiral pasta, dripping with oil, three pieces of cheddar cheese flakes, five pieces of cotija cheese bits, sprinkled with chili powder\".  'Cuz yeah, that's what it looked like.  

After two bites, the bowl was pushed away.  There's no amount of salt that can fix that.  

The only positive part of our experience was the graciousness of our server.  She immediately wanted to make it right and despite our reassurances that we really were ok, she had them remake the dish to see if it would be better.  IT WASN'T!  Second time around had a little more flavor, but it was just exactly the same.  And it didn't seem like anyone understood why we didn't like it.  Where am I?  Mac and Cheese bizarro world?!?  Again our awesome server took the bowl, apologized and took it off our bill.  We didn't ask her to, but she was being fair and I appreciate that.

My own dish, the roasted garlic lasagna with chicken was so un-special I forgot about it already.  Except for the fact that the noodles were burnt to a crisp on all four sides.  I needed a steak knife to eat that.

On the plus side my water with lemon was just right, so icy and watery!

So maybe just maybe I'm hoping the pizza is still stellar at this location, and some might think \" serves your right for getting something other than pizza, that's what Oregano's is good for\"...but why have it on your menu if you can't make it taste good?  I will try once more to see if the pizza is on par with my other Oregano's experience.  But I will say that if the Pizzookie is F-ed up, you WILL be hearing from me.  Seriously.  Don't mess with my Pizzookie.  EVER."}
{"text":"Oregano's has always been mine and my family's favorite restaurant. The service is always impeccable and the food never disappoints. This location is quite small compared to the other ones in the valley. It can get pretty busy on the weekend, but if you put your name on the waitlist the wait isn't too bad. If you are not dining with a large party you can always find a spot in the bar to eat. Tonight I got the Stuffed Rigatoni it was delicious. It comes with meat sauce and a piece of garlic bread. The portion is a decent size, you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We love this Oreganos location! The food is always fresh and delicious. The service is awesome! We have tried other locations in Scottsdale, Camelback and Glendale but this one is the best! We come here at least twice a month."}
{"text":"3.5***
this oregano's is located in the quaint downtown area in gilbert which is part of the heritage district.  nice patio in between the restaurant and the dedicated take out area. 

the customer service is friendly and quality of food is consistent. we have dined here only once (in the bar) because the lines normally wrap around the building and i refuse to wait for over 30 minutes for a table. 

last sunday we ordered two oregano's favorite chicken salad from the dedicated take out area of the restaurant. my favorites are the fresh salads, soup and generous sandwiches but the pizza is just average in my opinion.

overall i think it's a relaxed spot for date night or to call in some takeout.  even though it is a chain..its a decent one!"}
{"text":"I don't get what all the hype is about. The portions are huge. Too huge. The wait for a table is always crazy. Even if they don't seem busy it will take forever to give your order, get your order, get a refill or get a check. The food is OK - not great, not good, just OK."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best places my wife and I have eaten at. The food was amazing, the atmosphere was super fun, and our server Adam was incredible. I would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I still gave 5 stars due to the great service atmosphere and customer service,,, but at 8pm out of egg plants :/ not cool.
Drove quiet a bit to get here for the egg plants :$
May be next time :)"}
{"text":"This is just about my favorite restaurant in Phoenix for casual dining. The salads are large and the best I've had anywhere. The Southwest Caesar Shrimp Salad is nearly orgasmic. The meatball sub and sausage sub are huge and delicious. The pazookie desert is just about the best thing I've ever had, and might be my last meal request on death row. The only downside is the wait, it gets REALLY busy every lunch hour and evening. No call-ahead seating either, so I tend to drive up, put my name on the list, then go shopping nearby for an hour before returning for the final ten minute wait. But yeah, it's just hard to go wrong here, everything I've had ranges from good to wow..."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. What was once a delicious salad (Oregano's Favorite) is now tired, the iceberg lettuce having been cut hours earlier. The pizza crust was dry, like a cracker, not moist and flexible like it was in previous visits. We usually visit on Friday nights, so being busy isn't an excuse for the drop in quality we experienced. Still decent pizza experience, but there are better alternatives. It's certainly no longer our first choice for a pizzeria."}
{"text":"If you don't like Oreganos you are not human... 

Boom Dip, Pablo Picasso Salad, Big Rig w/ chicken finished with a Pazooki

Only things you will ever need in your life"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! Lots of choices on the menu. It takes at least 10 minutes to read through all of it. I recommend the thin crust pizza. It is to die for. Lots of options to choose from no matter what you are craving. Outdoor seating is nice as well."}
{"text":"Oregano's is always a solid place to go for pizza, especially if you like your crust very thin as I do. 

It's also great for kids. They're presented with a wad of pizza dough to keep them busy for what can be a pretty long wait for food. If you order the kids pizza, you can get them started eating ahead of the adults. For about $3, the kids can opt for a simple pepperoni, diamond cut, while the adults can select something more flavorful. For dessert a warm panned cookie with ice cream to share for just five bucks.

This location, in a building originally built to be a restaurant, is not as unique as some more creative converted locations, either a plus or a minus depending on your perspective. There is an outdoor patio with a very effective heating system if it's cold outside. 

The only problem, really, is that wait times can be long. We arrived at 5:15 p.m. on a Wednesday and still couldn't be seated immediately. That's Oregano's, I guess."}
{"text":"This would be a 5 star review if it weren't for the frequently long wait times. 

Once you are in,  the food is simply excellent and the staff is wonderful.   We've yet to have a bad experience or a bad meal. 

Same can be said for the to go process.   It's definitely not fast food convenient,  but the food is simply fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! Must save room and have the cookie. Be prepared for a wait time, though. Great food + great service = high demand but was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Oreganos is the best Italian food place I've ever been too. After moving to phoenix three years ago, we were taken to Oregano's in Goodyear. All we could say was wow. We since eaten at almost all of the locations in the valley. The Cave Creek spot is one of our favorites. We highly recommend this place for the best food in the valley."}
{"text":"First of all. Parking sucks bad!! Smh. Took me almost 45 minutes to fine parking. My goodness..

They don't do reservation here. So waited for an hour to be seated.
Over all.. this is a Great place for date night, girls night and of course family night. Anddddd make sure you share. Geez. Huge ass plates.
I always get there antipasto salad, vegetarian. :) andddd it's a must to get a chocolate chip pizzookie! Heaven!!!l"}
{"text":"I'm a little iffy about my true feelings for Oreganos, so as of right now they get three stars. I plan to give them another shot and dine in, since the order i got was to-go. Anywho, stopped in here and we checked out the menu ordered an order of the golden wings ( I believe they are called) hot/sweet flavor... these were very good. Also some on the meatiest wings I have ever had to be honest, hormone injected wings up in this joint is what you will get and they are very tasty. the boyfriend ordered the lasagna and the girl told us it would take 45 min alone for the lasagna..luckily we had a few errands to run so it was cool to come back and get our food but i  think that would have sucked if we had been eating there and having to wait ( especially if you were starving). Then again it's nice to know its cooked fresh. I had the Pesto pasta which came in a nice scooped out bread bowl with my choice of meat.. I got the Italian sausage. 

Everything was o.k, I went with high expectations and was let down a little, will try one of their pizzas next maybe that's the winner dish to have here..

p.s staff is very helpful/friendly and it is a nice atmosphere inside and out on the patio as well."}
{"text":"Walking in, I felt very welcomed.  My friend and I came in for lunch and the service was very fast and staff was friendly.  
Pizza was excellent, crust was just right!"}
{"text":"Love the Pablo Picasso salad!  Guacatoni appetizer was tasty and my daughter loved the wedding soup...warning HUGE bowl of soup!  Servers are always friendly but the wait is usually at least an hour no matter when we go..."}
{"text":"This location has the kindest bartender that has remembered my soft drink concoction for maybe three years now. I usually dine here during lunch. The bar area is usually the best bet for quick seating as it's seat yourself. I do quite enjoy their Pablo Picasso Salad and that they serve it with some presentation. The Salad is a meal portion in itself so be advised to bring your appetite."}
{"text":"The wait on a Saturday night was super long. I liked the Margherita pizza and the Cesar salad was really good as well. We also had a pazookie for dessert and that was delicious. It was pretty loud in the restaurant. Looks clean...didn't go into the restroom so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's Pizza, although the Cave Creek location has a lot to learn from their counterparts. I'm not sure if it is poor management or just hard to find good help in this area. It's not that their pizza is bad, it is actually great; the big problems are service and attitude of the staff. Please folks, change your ways, show great improvement because I would like to keep coming back, although you have to show us that you care by making these improvements!!"}
{"text":"Very yummy!! Their garlic cheese bread is awesome. I love their criss cut fries. And they seriously have the BEST beef sandwich ever. I know you wouldn't think so at a pizza/italian place but it's huge and awesome! Lots of cheese and meat and really good bread. Of course the staff is the nicest and most attentive. They are just super happy at that restaurant all the time. It must be a fun place to work at :)"}
{"text":"A friend told us to try Oregano's during our Spring Training visit. Friday evening we did. Our garlic cheesy bread was great and our Chicago pan pizza was absolutely outstanding. Our server, Kacy, took great care of us and her recommendations proved to be spot on. In fact, we were so happy with our meal and service, we took a group of friends there tonight, just so they could try it too. Our group had a Chicago pan pizza, a giant meatball sandwich, pasta and wings. Everyone enjoyed everything. (Oh and I also got a pizza to take home for tomorrow.)

We will happily drive every one of the 365 miles from Southern California to eat at this Oregano's again."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of pizza, way too much pizza. And Oregano's deep dish is, without a doubt, my favorite deep dish pizza outside of Chicago!"}
{"text":"We used to frequent more often but it has gone downhill since they opened. 
Went Monday night. No seating available so went to wait in the bar area. Since when is it okay that a mother with her two small children are sitting at the bar eating dinner?  Bad on mom, but bad in the restaurant. Minors at the bar while adults are being served alcohol?  Not in my day. Minors were never even allowed in the bar area!
Ok. So we get seated. Service was good. Food ok. Not great like it used to be. 
Christmas music playing loudly on speakers. Come on If I want to hear Christmas music I would do so at home or in the car (which I don't).  So I am paying for a meal & you are forcing me to hear this music?  No thanks. 
It is getting so annoying going out & having to fight the crowds for mediocre food & eh service & then I have to listen to loud Christmas music?  Guess I'm the grinch then. See you after the holidays & snowbirds go home. Also when you change your bar protocol. Really???"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Oregano's in town! Doesn't matter what dish you get its always great! Staff have to say are the friendliest and very attentive from hostes, waiters and management. Manager bald Mexican checks how was our service and food and always friemdly!!! I recommend try all the items on the menu can't go wrong!!!

We always get the same thing 
Big Rig Pasta
But this time we tried
ZUCCHINI STICKS 
OREGANO'S POWER GREENS
MOM'S SAUSAGE & PEPPERS

Delicious and my wife and I left full and happy and Cheese Cake was icing in the cake!!!

Thank you and look forward to our next visit!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience we waited over an hour to be seated and then when we were seated we were ignored the waiter wasn't very nice every time we ordered something he told us we didn't want to order it because it takes 45 minutes to cook , well we should of ordered what we wanted because it took him a half hour to come back and take our order then we waited another hour for our food and let me tell you the kids were starving by then !! So now to the food wasn't very good at all my grandson woke up at midnight throwing up what he ate so did Mom and Dad , will never go back to this location!!  Should of went to the Gilbert location it's soo much better and the workers are nicer and the food is 100% better. So I wanted to Thank the Chandler location for making my daughter's birthday the most unpleasant one ever!!"}
{"text":"Do you have to wait a long time for your food? Yes  Is it the best damn food you will ever eat?  Probability"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and our server was attentive! We sat outside and it was a bit chilly so it was really nice that they had overhead heaters. That really helped :)"}
{"text":"Terrible experience today at lunch. I usually love this place. Today I waited over 30 mins for my food while my co-workers were served although we asked for all of our food to come out together. By the time my food came, everyone was finished eating so I got it to go. The waitress didn't even acknowledge the wait time and really didn't check in other than quickly stating my food would be out \"in a minute\" 20 mins before it came out. Definitely not happy with today and to top it off, my food was burnt"}
{"text":"Other than the wait some days, what is there to not like about Oregano's? Consistent from location to location. Consistent over time. The chocolate chip cookie dessert is one of the best ways I know to put a cap on the end of a stressful day!"}
{"text":"Still 5 stars. Over and over and over, again. I'm here easily 2-3x/month. Still my favorite of their area locations.

Tonight's arrival was around 8. Still a 30 minute wait. 100 degrees outside. They have this awesome air conditioning version of a heat lamp outside. It, along with the misters worked amazingly well. Thank you.

Seated and quickly greeted by Alyssa. Beverages served quickly. Coupe D'ville chicken parm orders placed and served in a reasonable time. Chicken was a large portion, moist and tender. The pasta was steaming hot and plentiful. Alyssa did a great job. Very friendly. Orders handled correctly. Attentive when needed.

Consistent across the board. Friendly people. Clean dining room. Really good food that is an excellent value for the money. Unlike so many local restaurants, this one is worthy of the typical 30 minute wait for a table."}

{"text":"Always consistent. Great value. Can't go wrong with any of their locations. Chicken parm was very tender. Service a bit on the slow side tonight."}
{"text":"We had a team builder event at work today and before we did our charity work, we came here for lunch.  I have to say, the staff was awesome!   There were 17 of us and everything went very smooth.  Our server was on top of everything from drink refills, to clearing plates, to serving everybody's food at the same time, etc.  Excellent, excellent service!

For food, me and my buddy Jon split an 18 inch thin crust pizza with sausage and olives.  The 18 inch pizza looks like a behemoth, but it is almost paper thin, so you can eat a lot of it.  It was delicious!  I had only been to Oregano's one time before, and I got a sausage and onion stuffed pie.  I remember their sausage being really delicious, and today confirmed it!  This pizza had huge chunks of sausage all throughout the pizza.  It was awesome!  Everybody else ordered a wide variety of foods from lasagna, to salads, to pasta dishes etc and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Portions are HUGE!  To finish the meal, we ordered a couple pizza cookies to pass around the table.  A salted caramel one and a chocolate chip cookie one.  If you have a sweet tooth, this is a perfect dessert.....a huge cookie topped with 3 scoops of ice cream! 

I have to mention the excellent service once again!  Everyone in the restaurant worked as a team (getting refills, delivering food etc) and on the way out, every single person we walked by thanked us for coming in and wished us a good rest of our day.  I mean, EVERY. SINGLE. EMPLOYEE!  That is rare these days and it was nice to see.  I can't wait until they open the Oregano's out near my house in Surprise.  I know I will come here often.  The pizza is fantastic and the service has been 5 stars both the times I have been to an Oregano's.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I have tried about every single popular/famous pizza joint in Phoenix, but had never had Oregano's until the other day.  I'm usually a thin crust guy and if I am going to eat Chicago thin crust, I am probably going to Spinato's.  Have been since I moved here and will continue to until I leave.  I have had Spinato's \"thick\" crust pizza though and it is not good at all.  That brings us to Oregano's.  I was craving a thick pizza and had some options for either their \"pan pizza\" or their \"stuffed pizza\".  Reading the descriptions on their website, the stuffed pizza sounded mighty fine!  I placed my order for a 10 inch sausage and onions stuffed pizza.  

These stuffed pizzas take about 45 minutes to cook so the lady on the phone told me it would be ready in about an hour.  I waited for awhile and then went down to pick it up (I live in Surprise and it's only about a 15 minute drive down the 303.  It's definitely a lot closer to my house than some of my other favorite pizza joints in Phoenix and surrounding areas.)  I parked, walked in, paid the lady my money (Just over 21.00) and was on my way.  Customer service was excellent at the front counter.  Every employee in there said hi and they even apologized profusely for a slight delay of getting my order.  It wasn't even a delay...there was one dude in front of me ordering yet they still apologized for the wait.  It was sincere too.  It shows that they have excellent customer service standards.  I appreciated it even though it was not needed in the first place!  The girl grabbed my pizza from the warming oven and handed it over.  This thing weighed no less than 4 lbs.  No joke!  This was by far the heaviest pizza I have ever carried!  I drove home and dug in.  Here is how it was............

10 Inch Sausage and Onion Stuffed Pizza-  I opened the box and was immediately impressed!  This pizza looked amazing!  It was a sea of red sauce dusted with some parmesean cheese.  The crust was nice and thick and the whole thing was topped with a few thin slices of onion.  They do not cut this pizza.  If they did, the guts would spill out all over the place.  It had been about 30 minutes after I picked it up so it had some time to settle.  I cut this bad boy into 4 slices.  Each slice must have been at least a pound.  If you are looking for multiple meals, this is definitely your pizza.  A normal person could only eat about 1 slice.  If you are a fat ass and/or starving, you might be able to eat 2.  I grabbed a spatula and picked up a piece and put it on my plate and dug in.  Wow!  This pizza was delicious!  They use tons of Wisconsin cheese, they use a ton of sausage (kind of like a huge sausage patty) which you get some in every bite, and then some sliced up onions too.  The onions were a tad skimp and that is about the only bad thing I can say about this pizza.  The crust was nice and buttery and flaky.  It was damn near perfect.  I was stuffed after one slice and proceeded to eat the remaining 3 slices over the next few mornings for breakfast.  

If I ever want a deep dish pizza, I know where I'm coming!  It will be hard to stray away from the stuffed pizza.  It was pretty much perfection and the value was awesome because you can get so many meals out of it.  Pair that with great customer service, and this is a 5 star joint in my book.  I couldn't imagine a better stuffed pizza out there (at least in AZ...Chicago, maybe lol).  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I had been to a few other Oregano's before, and was always impressed.  The food is usually 4 star worthy, but the service itself has always been 5 stars.  I seriously cannot remember receiving such great service at a restaurant in a long time.  My wife, son, and buddy who was out here from Vegas, decided to come down to this location before we went to the Padre game.  We arrived at around 11:15 and were seated right away.  We placed our order for a large garden salad, an order of garlic bread, a small stuffed pizza with sausage and spinach and a small pepperoni pan pizza.  Here is how everything was............

Large Garden Salad-  Oregano's salads are massive!  They can feed a small army.  We each ate about 2 bowls full, and there were still leftovers.  Our waitress brought us our own individual dressings, too!  It was a pretty basic salad, but it gave us something to eat while waiting for the pizzas to cook (45 minutes or so).  The Italian dressing was very good!

Garlic Bread-  Solid!  About a 2 foot long loaf of garlic bread.  It had the perfect amount of butter/oil and garlic.  It tasted great!  I could have ate another loaf of it!  Everyone at the table thought it was great!

Stuffed Pizza-  I had only had Oregano's stuffed pizza once before, and it was fantastic!  My buddy is a huge sausage and spinach fan, so we went with those toppings.  Their stuffed pizza is a sight to see!  It's cut into 6 slices and each slice is about a pound.  Oregano's sausage is fantastic!  The spinach they use was pretty fresh, too.  It was a good combo of flavors.  We each ate 2 slices and were pretty much stuffed.  I took the other 2 slices home for leftovers.

Pan Pizza-  This was the first time I had experienced their pan pizza.  It was good, but not as good as their stuffed or thin crust Chicago style.  We got this one mostly for my wife, but it turns out she really didn't care for it.  She didn't like the sauce (Everyone that I have talked to that doesn't like Oregano's, doesn't like the sauce.)  I ate one slice and we took home about 4 slices.  Reheated the next day, it tasted fine.  I don't know if I would get the pan pizza again, but there was nothing wrong with it and it was pretty tasty.

On to why this place gets 5 stars.......THE SERVICE!  Our waitress was absolutely awesome!  She was very friendly, personable and happy.  She kept our drinks filled, plates cleared etc.  She even mentioned that we were the most easy going table she had all day and that she appreciated our laid back attitude.  Nice!  Every other employee I encountered was very welcoming, too.  That is 3 for 3 on different Oregano's, as far as receiving beyond excellent service.  That alone will keep me coming back!  Food is a solid 4, but the service always bumps it up to a 5 IMO."}
{"text":"We had the chicken wings with honey mustard BBQ sauce. That was awesome. the Caesar salad is awesome. On the chicken parm sandwich and pasta the chicken parm was very dry and the pasta sauce tasted a little weird. Not bad, just...weird. Too much oregano, and a hint of pepperoncini?  Don't know that we'll be back.

They also quoted us 25 minutes on the chicken wings, and they arrived at the table first!"}
{"text":"I did not get a chance to eat the food.  Let me say that up front.  We got there around 4:25 on a Monday with a party of 8.  We tried calling ahead around 1:00 and were told they don't take reservations.  Who doesn't take reservations???  The place didn't seem overly busy.  After a few of the hosts looked at each other and a discussion with a server ensued to see if she wanted an 8 top were were told they were on a 45min to 1 hour wait.  Basically because the server didn't want to be bothered we left and and tried Babbo.  Glad we did.  Babbo seemed just as busy...gave us great service and excellent food.  Glad they got the $200 sale.  Hopefully we can give this place a try on a future date...if they get around to finding a server to take an 8 top at 4:25 on a Monday."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to Oreganos and I was not disappointed! 
While we were waiting for a table we were offered samples of pizza that was really good! Once seated our server, Austin, greeted us promptly! He offered his advice about the menu and what he liked best which was greatly appreciated because we had no idea what we wanted! The food was AMAZING! It did take a while to get the pizza but it was worth the wait because the food was extremely fresh! We decided to add on the chocolate chip cookie pizza which was the best decision we ever made! Let me tell you, it was AMAZING!!! Definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I LOVE oregano's! The pizza and salad are great. Service is okay. 

The Big Beefstro Salad is awesome!! The ribeye is thinly sliced and they're pretty generous on portion. Everything tastes fresh. Note that the dressing is spicy, and sometimes may be even spicier than normal. There's jalapeños in the dressing. 

Pizza is great. It's like the perfect thin crust pizza. I love the Bistro Classic!"}
{"text":"I never go to Phoenix without a visit  (or two) to Oregano's. The Big Rig with a couple \"Bangers\" are a must. Portions are huge and consistent . The employees seem to love working there as the service is always great. Great pre game dinner place before the Blackhawks spank the Coyotes. Thanks Mark!"}
{"text":"I have been to Oregano's at least once a week for the past two months (since I moved to the Phoenix area). I have never had an issue finding parking, and since I do not mind the heat, I have never had to wait to get a seat (ample patio seating - if you do not mind friendly pigeons). The pastas and salads have been consistently tasty. For starters, I recommend a small Simple House Salad - it is plenty to split between two people.

Last night the Wings of Fire (medium) were not up to par. Previous orders of the wings have been outstanding, but last night was quite a disappointment. The sauce seemed different (runnier), the wings were small, and there was a rubbery texture on a few of them. I am hoping that it was just an off night for the quality of the wings and will be trying them one more time. Also, if you are a fan of the taste of calamari and traditional preparation of it, do not order the Bistro Calamari. The fried coating was way too thick and took away from the texture and taste of the calamari. 

Back to the positives! The Brussels Sprouts are delicious (note that they take about 20 minutes to cook). Both the Alfredo the Dark and the Big Rig Pasta (with meatballs) are delightful. They have a slight spice to them and the pasta is cooked perfectly (to my standards at least). The bread that accompanies the pastas adds a nice touch to the meal. 

If you have room, I suggest ending your meal with The Original Pizza Cookie - Chocolate Chip! My only complaint is that there is not an option of regular peanut butter flavor. Ask for a refill of your beverage in a to-go cup, it is refreshing for the drive home.

Of course I suggest trying Oregano's! :)"}
{"text":"So I'm a lil behind in writing reviews but here we go. I had heard about this \"stuffed pizza\" joint in Arizona and anyone who knows me knows i LOVE deep dish!! So when i hit AZ for Comic Con this was a must try. 

We started with the garlic parm lime wings which were cooked nicely and seasoned perfectly. they were fantastic. The lime added that extra lil zing to garlic parm that I haven't had before. 

Then I had the Italian Wedding Soup which came in a bread bowl (i think it was pizza dough shaped as the bowl). It was perfection, the seasoning, the balance, the ingredients. 

Then the main course, the stuffed pizza. A deepdish pizza topped by a thin crust top and the sauce ontop of that. It was PERFECTION. So much cheese and so filled with pepperoni. The crust had a nice crunch to it and the flavor of the dough was perfect to me.

Oregano's is now a must hit joint for me anytime I end up in Phoenix or near Phoenix. Go check it out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been there twice now and loved everything! We are always welcomed right away when u walk in which is great because I hate when hostesses ignore you. First time my fiancé and I came in and sat at the bar. The bartender was busy as it was New Year's Eve but she was very friendly and provided great service!! I ordered the chicken parm and it was so good. Came on noodles and a side piece of garlic toast. If was so good. My fiancé had some mushroom pasta dish and wasn't impressed. He got meatballs added and a side of toast and said that the meatballs saved the dish. The calamari was amazing!! The second time I went I offered the chicken Alfredo and that was really good too! The prices for what you get is perfect."}
{"text":"As a pizza savant, I am severely limited by both nature and nurture:)

I have been to the pinnacle (Bianco's Pizzeria)...a couple of times, in fact...and found it unfulfilling:(

I have looked into the pizza abyss (Chuck E Cheese or Totino's Frozen...too close to call), and come away scarred but stronger.

I suppose some of it is nurture...the cattle ranch was a hard place to grow up and I did not eat pizza until I left home at 15 for college...Shakey's in Corvallis, OR:)

Losing my pizza virginity was a revelation and a delight:)...I was forever altered...forever better:)

And there is, no doubt, some nature involved...I can only think of 2 things that I can't eat and neither one involves pizza of any sort:)

And that brings me to today...I will at least try anybody's pizza pie:)

Some are better than others, but very few are truly bad:)

So when the Beautiful Carin and I wandered over to Oregano's the other night, it was with the anticipation of a pretty good pizza and a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy it in:)

We were not disappointed:)

The entirely reasonable 20 minute wait went by quickly with free pizza slices to nibble and frequent refills for our drinks, while we sat comfortably and listened to the music:)

When we got our table...outside, under the mist...our server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable...but we already knew what we wanted:)

It's all pretty good at Oregano's:)

This time we had a deep dish pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and olive pie, along with a Mrs. Gibbilini's spinach salad...way too much for 2 people but the leftovers are great for lunches and dinner for 2 more days:)

We've had the thin crust, the Chicago style, sandwiches, and salad...even the wings, on occasion:)

The pies are well designed, well prepared, customizable and tasty!

The sauce isn't too sweet, the cheeses selected for the pies complement the sauce and the crusts are well made and have great \"tooth\"...the right mix of crunchy vs. chewy:)

I've seen the debates...oh yes, I read the reviews...\"Chicago pies rock\"...\"New York is the only real pizza\"...yada, yada, yada:)

Well, I am waiting for a pizza to rock my world the way that first slice of Shakey's pepperoni did, all those years ago...it may not ever happen...they say you never forget your first time:)

But Oregano's always serves up a good pie (regardless of whether I'm in the mood for Chicago, Thin crust, deep dish or whatever...along with all the accompaniments and alternatives I could ask for:)

Does Oregano's rock my world?...No, only the Beautiful Carin does that these days, but they do bake up a pretty decent pie:)"}
{"text":"I keep it simple with Oregano's.  I usually order the Bowl o' Pasta with extra marinara.  Lately I've also added the brussel sprouts as well.  I love the marinara!  It has a bit of spiciness to it, and the brussel sprouts have a hint of rosemary.  I usually order take out because there is often a wait when I finally decide that I'm ready for dinner.  Good service and the garlic bread that comes with the pasta is excellent!"}
{"text":"Consistent food and flavor. This Oregano's is bigger than some I've been too. 

They lost a star for me with their garlic bread portion. It was like a sliver of bread. A bit disappointing. The spaghetti I had was good sized, but the bread really lacked. Also we waited 25 minutes for our food, and it did not seem that busy. 

Get me a serious piece of garlic bread Oregano's, and we'll talk stars."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome pizza, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The salads are HUGE! Oh, and don't forget a pizookie!!"}
{"text":"Food is a solid 3.5 and service made it easy to round up to 4. 

Some friends were in town and we decided to meet here for a late lunch/early dinner on a Sunday.  I can see how parking would be a challenge but we found a spot in the main lot behind the restaurant. They were quite busy.  But we waited on the shady patio and had a drink at the bar.  There were 6 of us and we were easily seated at one of their large booths inside. 
We were hungry and looking back we admittedly had eyes bigger than our belly's.  We ordered the Bruschetta Authentico and the Lawrence's Stuffed 'Shrooms to start.  The fresh onions on the Bruschetta really added quite a bit of flavor, I didn't find the addition of the marinara provided necessary.  
The Stuffed mushrooms were 2 large portabella mushrooms stuffed full of sausage marinara and melted cheese.  It took a little effort to cut them up and share, but they were quite good. In fact they would make a great  main dish to share with a salad. 

Two in our party put in Lasagna orders for one of each variety at the same time as the app orders as it takes 30-45 min for Lasagna.  The rest of us took a while to decide on what we wanted.  The other 4 of us ordered the Aunt Margherita Pizza, 2 ordered the Alfredo The Dark and added broccoli and I ordered the Zainy Ziti and added sausage.  

All plates were extremely generous servings.  I personally made 3 meals out of my Ziti dish.  It was simple yet tasty and served in a baked thin crust bowl.  I sampled the Margherita pizza which I found to be lack luster.  The Alfredo dish was not as flavorful as I would have expected and was slightly rescued by the seasoning on the southwest bread that is served with the dish.  Had my dining companions not chosen to add the broccoli I would have considered this a little plain. It was not as creamy as expected (good and bad).  

I can see myself taking a trip back here. I look forward to trying some other menu items."}
{"text":"The hostesses got a bit confused and didn't communicate well with each other when we got there. They got our seating messed up and we had to wait a bit after they told us we'd be called. Not a problem! They got it all straightened out and everything was good, fast! 
As always the food was very good, served hot, orders were correct and service was prompt. All in all a nice meal with friends that have never been here before but they said they'll be back."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Oreganos and now there's one close to me!  I stopped with Sarah H last weekend and enjoyed a grilled veggie sandwich before our seemingly weekly trip to Costco.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have to say the lure of Oregano's is more the ambiance than the food. On a beautiful evening it's a lot of fun to sit outside with a glass of wine and some good friends and enjoy a meal here. We have friends that come in from Chico every year for the Spring training games and it's kind of a tradition to eat dinner one of the nights at Oregano's. When the toddler was born across the street, my husband walked over that night and got himself some lasagna take-out to come eat with me so now it's also a tradition for us to come here on the toddler's birthday (or thereabouts) to have some dinner and reminisce on that day so that's where we're headed tonight with our brand new three-year-old. 

It's probably me, but none of their pastas really do it for me - I just don't like them heavily sauced and their pizzas are what my husband likes - cracker thin or oily and thick. There's just no in between. I enjoy their salads a lot and the garlic bread and can eat an order of bruschetta on my own. My husband is also a big fan of the roasted garlic chicken lasagna and it seems we always order a pizza cookie for dessert, though we might get one on the house tonight being the toddler's birthday and all. 

The waiters and waitresses are always friendly and helpful. In fact once I guess our order was taking too long to come out (we hadn't even realized) and the manager came out and apologized and gave us some drinks and dessert for free. 

Though obviously not a fancy place at all, it's always proven to be a good place to bring out of town guests. The ambiance, food and service make for a unique experience and won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place to eat with family and Friends. This place hits all three: quality, quantity, and a really good price. One of my favorites in PHX"}
{"text":"So they have catered to my school before and I tried the pasta. But the other day we were passing by and I was like hey let's try it. So we did. 

I got the big slice (actually 2 slices) of cheese pizza and my man got 2 of the big slices of pepperoni. I also got the sweet potato fries. He got a cherry Pepsi and I got water. Holy monkeys everything about this place is huge! The booths, the cups, the pizza, the sweet potato fries.... and the Cookie Pizza... OMG. We got the peanut butter chocolate chip and omg was it amazing! It came out with ice cream on top. It was so good. 

All in all all our food plus tip was $30. A little on the more expensive side, but the quality, size, and service was all 5 star."}
{"text":"Great food as always. The Lady is a Scampi is the best!!  The service was good too. Sat outside and it was great!  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Great experience for my first time to this location! Amazing service, I believe our waitresses name was Danielle! Very attentive! Ice cold beer and delicious food!! Got the cookie, half chocolate chip and half white cholocalte macadamia nut. Me and my mom left full and happy!"}
{"text":"Back when I lived in Phoenix this was one of the only places I bothered with eating at. Started by a Chicagoan who moved to Phoenix, they get deep dish right and make just about everything else in the style of delicious. I was in town last week to hike the Grand Canyon and stopped in. Man, I miss their food. Thank God I live in Chicago and can get something similar! Be warned though. Their food is BIG."}
{"text":"I heard this place opened up in February and my parents and I decided to try it out for an early Father's Day lunch. We got there at noon and they said we would have to wait about 30min for a table- fine. 15 min or so we were seated. This feeling of this restaurant is kind of like chills or Applebee's. Very CASUAL. This is an Italian restaurant that doesn't serve bread with cheese and olive oil. The place was very busy and semi-loud. We got our entrees and I ordered angel hair pasta with Alfredo sauce and chicken. Mom got a shrimp with spiral pasta and dad got a lasagna. Dad loved his lasagna and devoured it, mom got a mushroom appetizer which she finished and since she is a slow eater she wasn't able to finish her whole meal, so she took it to go, but she said it was good, but they give you only 3 jumbo shrimp, apparently that's a 1/2ib of shrimp. My dish on the other hand was below average. I know my Italian dishes very well and this was disappointing. There was almost no Alfredo sauce in my pasta, which made my noodles very dry. I ate the middle which has the sauce, but couldn't finish the rest. It took me forever to hunt down our waitress and I even asked another waitress to find ours! When she finally came I asked her if she can bring me a cup of Alfredo sauce and just pop it in the microwave because the whole time I was looking for her my dish was cold. She said \"how about I just being you a new dish\" I was shocked, but said ok thank you. She didn't have to do that and I get kind of bad having them do that over. Anyways in 5 min they bring it out again and the dish is worse than the first one. The chicken instead of spliced was like pulled pork all over my plate and once again where the heck is the Alfredo. The worst part I had a black ladies hair in my dish. I took it out and didn't say anything because I didn't want to wait any longer I was hungry and both my parents were almost done eating. I ate it but trust me I have made better at home and I didn't enjoy it. I won't be back to this restaurant. When a customer is looking around trying to locate a waitress and 3-4 waitresses walk past noticing me staring why not come up and ask if I am ok instead of just walking past me? I realize you're not my waitress, but I thought this would be more like a team environment. Trust me I know it's tough and a lot of pressure to work at a restaurant, but try to smile and work together better. Like I said I won't be back. I miss my bread and olive oil with parmesan cheese. Not a true Italian restaurant. I'm from Chicago too and they have Chicago style stuff but I am too afraid to try it."}
{"text":"There must be something real special about this Oregano everyone is all upbeat and acting other worldly"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant to go too! Always great tasting and fantastic service. Good for a family outings or going out with friends! Does get packed but it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"Great place to eat with plenty of eye candy for guys...complete with shorts shorts and cute faces. 
Now the food was good...i actually am on a diet...and it actually had some good choices: wedding soup and Margarita pizza. The soup was filled with pebble pasta, some meat and a big meat ball...complete with a cheese breadstick. The pizza is a thin crust and not bad at all....you have to eat the whole pizza to be full. Great ambience and has an outside patio. Thumbs up for Italian food"}
{"text":"I love the beefstro salad !!! It's so amazing. Every bite has steak and the food is always fresh here"}
{"text":"It's always good here can't complain. Everyone is friendly ! Beefstro salad is the best ! No slices on the weekends is not a good idea. Kids have to order a 12\" but does feed two"}
{"text":"If you want the best thin crust pizza around this is the place to go. Great service. Staff is friendly. You can talk to the cooks as they make your pizza. All the other Italian dishes are also good. Casual bar area is great for indoor or outdoor relaxation. Bartenders are super nice and attentive. Good drink selection. Busy ever night but wait is short."}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!!

Ever since I discovered Oregano's I've never been back to Olive Garden. I think their food is fantastic and I've learned to try other things aside from their meatballs...ummm! Service is always, always, always fantastic! The servers are so helpful and friendly. I have nothing bad to say about this place. If you do come here...be sure to explore the menu.

One bad thing, but I can't knock a star off for it, is that the wait can be extremely long especially during lunch hours. I've waited an hour before and at other times, I've gotten lucky to get the last table available. 

Check out the pictures!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing which includes the food, the stuff, and the cleanliness of the restaurant. I was treated very well, so if your looking for solid sandwiches or the pizza, then look no further than this place. P.S get the pizzokie! Its delicious!"}
{"text":"It had been years since I ate there. I truly had forgotten had fantastic the food is there! The flavors are just amazing! The atmosphere is fun and upbeat. The staff was great! This was a business lunch.... I will definitely be returning for dinner and drinks!!"}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago its hard to compare our pizza to anyone elses, but this one comes pretty close to my favorite Lou Malnatti's in Chicago.  The large Oregano's salade had more lettuce then toppings which was disappointing.  The pan pizza only comes in two sizes, 10\" and 12\", and the large one really only feeds 2 people.  Not sure why they don't offer it in a 16\", but it would be a good idea.  It was delicious and the crust and sauce was tasty.   Last time I was in Glendale we didn't realize it was so popular and didn't call ahead to order a pizza.  Learned our lesson, and we ordered our take out an hour before we wanted to eat.  No reservations are taken and wait to be seated is very long.  Much easier and faster to take out here.  On line we found the menu and this too made it simple for us to get what we wanted, and to see all the items on the large menu.  Great pizza, but weird getting fortune cookies and mints thrown into the bag for dessert!  Must be an inside tradition locals understand?  I will ask next time we get pizza there which will be for sure not to far off into the future."}
{"text":"Amazing portions for a very reasonable price. The food is pretty good, servers are nice, and it is usually a busy, fun place. I've had great experiences here. One time my food was a little off and the manager came over himself, tasted it, and had a new plate brought over immediately. My favorite is the Big Rig - it's spicy, creamy, and HUGE portion."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great pizza, massive salads, amazing pasta, French bread is so so good and you just simply can't go wrong with the Huge Guacatoni it simply delicious. I would say the only issue with this place is trying to get in here on the weekends or evenings. The wait is usually crazy. Maybe a second location would be good. But usually with long lines comes good food and that's the case here for sure. Staff is always on lint and the joint is clean. The vibe inside with the old 50,60's style decor is a nice touch. Very comfy. I've tried so many things from here and I have really enjoyed it all. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"We ordered at 739pm today. The first thing we asked when we called in our pick up order was how long it would take...once we let them know the items we wanted we were told 15-20 mins. We got there 15 mins later and didn't leave with our food until 822pm. My wife wasn't offered a drink and there was no apology at all. When you screw up in the service industry at least apologize and make an effort to make it right! Your staff obviously don't care."}
{"text":"Service was good at fist but then it got super slow. We hardly saw the waitress. 
My second recommendation is to remove the Puerto Peñasco pizza it tastes nothing but cilantro, or at least put less cilantro on it for it to have a nice balance."}
{"text":"I like the food a lot. The service is a tad slow, but adequate. I have to warn you though! If you ask for anything extra, you will be charged for it! I asked for an extra side of marina sauce because the meatball sub has none on it. I was not told that I would be charged for it. This is really tacky in my opinion. At least tell people they will be charged. Perhaps if you put some sauce on the sandwich I wouldn't have to ask for it! Anyhow, I did end up getting a free pizza cookie for signing up for their loyalty program. We thoroughly enjoyed that. 
So, the cheesiness (no pun intended) is what is stopping a 5 star rating. That and the slow service. I guess that's just how they roll at Oregano's. We didn't even order pizza! The Queen Creek location is slow too. I did make my opinion known to the manager to which she apologized and blamed the minimum wage increase. Really? Excuses? Most employees in restaurants don't even make minimum wage so that excuse doesn't fly with me. 
I'll end up going back because I like the food, but tell me ahead of time if you're going to charge me extra. It's the point of the matter. It's not the cost."}
{"text":"All I have ever had was their thin crust pizza.  It is the bomb !!  I always try to pick one up when I'm working on that side of the valley, and have not been disappointed.  Sometimes it can take quite a while for the food to be made though, as they are always super busy.  Can't wait to dine in someday and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I give the food 5 stars but the service just a 2.5. We've been here an hour and a half. Food took at least half an hour for a lunch easy pasta bowl. They aren't that busy. We were seated right away. The server was really very nice and pleasant though!"}
{"text":"So the last time I was here there were a few things that didn't go well. This time, almost everything was great. C had just finished with his play and wanted pizza. He and K bantered back and forth, C wanted Oreganos, K wanted Rosati's. C wins. We were already heading home so instead of turning around and going to the Gilbert location, we headed for the dreaded Germann Rd. location. I say dreaded because I knew, I knew the parking would SUCK. And, it did. heck, it was a Saturday night and Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers was kickin it. The parking lot was packed but I drove around the back of the buildings and found a spot. Not the safest place you want to be on a dark night, but oh well.
We got sat right away. No doubt. It was almost 10 and there was no one waiting. Probably couldn't find parking. Scott was our server. He came up almost as soon as we were sat and took our drink order. We also tossed in an order of Cheese Bread with Marinara ($5.88). This stuff is soooo goood. Oooey Gooey melted cheese on an entire Baguette which ends up toasted just right. And with my favorite marinara, it's just the best cheese bread around.
As I always do, I ordered the Big Dinner Salad ($3.99) w/ dressing on the side. The lettuce is fresh although I do wish the prep cooks would tear it or cut it into smaller pieces. sometimes you can end up with a huge strip of Romaine which is just unruly.
We also ordered an 18\" Thin with sausage and caramelized onions ($19.87). The crust was almost perfect as were the toppings. A great job on a thin crust. 
Now comes why not 5 stars. Styrofoam to-go boxes. We had a good portion of pizza left and Scott brought out a Styrofoam box. Would someone at Oregano's please put a stop to this practice. Pizza belongs in a box. The layers of thin crust end up sticking together and really, you might as well just throw the whole thing away because it can be very difficult to re heat the leftovers. BUT, being an Oregano's regular, I have learned to keep the paper from the cheese bread and use it to separate the layers of leftover pizza. Shouldn't be my job though.
Crappy parking (again), yummy cheese bread, awesome marinara, very good thin crust pizza, fair prices, decent service. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"C wanted pizza and since his rehearsal was just down the street at the community center, what better place to go. We got here about a quarter to 5 and the inside dining room was almost full. For a Thursday night, I was impressed that it was that busy. There was plenty of seating outside however, and the two bar areas were also empty.
Our server was Andrea. She was very good. She was attentive, kept our drinks filled and made polite small talk when appropriate.
We ordered a 16\" Thin crust with sausage ($15.98) and a couple drinks ($2.59 ea). The pie came out hot and bubbly plus the crust wasn't burnt (as it has been at this and other locations). Winner winner pizza dinner. 
C was very happy and he knows his Oregano's. He's been a regular of the Oregano's chain since he was 8 weeks old (he's almost 10), has been to the opening of two locations (Chandler & Paradise Valley) and pretty much says Oregano's is his favorite restaurant. Now I've been going to Oregano's since they opened in Old Town in 1993, have been to every location except the newest in Goodyear and definitely have eaten at this chain more than anywhere else. This was a good experience. I don't know how it could have been better.
Great pizza, fair prices, nice attentive server. 5 Stars"}
{"text":"It's with great sadness that I have to give my old standby favorite restaurant a 2 star review but here it is. I've been coming here since they 1st opened. There was a time when 2+ hour waits were common on Fri & Sat nights & I was stopping in 3X a week. But after our experience today for lunch I would be shocked if anyone would wait at all. Our server Pedro was ok. I think he touched the table 6X. He didn't go above or beyond so he would be a 3 star. The kitchen however, was S L O W. No excuses for a Friday afternoon.
My friend S had the Pablo Picasso Mexico salad, Big $7.89. Should have had a good half handful of seasoned shredded chicken on it. Not so much. I would say it was worth the price though. My buddy S had the Big Meatball sandwich. $9.29. He said it was very good. Meatballs were moist & flavorful. He's a big time valley food blogger, food judge & all around good guy. I trust his palate. I would like to say that I remember the days when this sandwich came with 4 meatballs. Now it comes with 3. (Insert unhappy imoticon here)
I ordered the Bunch O Chicken. $4.99. It's suppossed to be 1/2 lb of their sauteed & seasoned chicken. Not so sure there's was 8 oz of chicken in the dish but since I left my scale at home I'll give them the benefit of doubt. I also ordered the Brussels Sprouts. $4.89. The menu says \"roasted the Italian way\". I'm pretty sure most Italians would never lay claim to this dish (see picture). I love roasted brussel sprouts & these were just wrong. Not a difficult dish to execute by any means so I'm amazed they did such a poor job and even more amazed that the kitchen mgr ALLOWED it to be sent out. Tsk tsk. Because of this, 2 stars."}
{"text":"C and I stopped in on a Wednesday night. As in the past we were pleasantly greeted by the host. He sat us outside by the fire pit as the place was hopin'. Being outside on a cold night didn't sound like a good idea but we were near the fire pit and the heat lamps were working fine. It was actually very comfortable.
Our server was Timothy. He was easily one of the best servers I've encountered in a long while. Kudos to Timothy.
C ordered Kids Pasta w/ Rigatoni. ($4.78) He loved it. He said the pasta was fine and the sauce was great.
I ordered the side of Brussels Sprouts ($4.89) and the side of Chicken ($4.99). The Brussels Sprouts were cooked almost perfectly. I didn't find one sprout that was under cooked. Yummy.
The chicken was seasoned nicely and tasted great. 
Awesome Service. Clean Facility. Reasonable prices. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"A++! Had a large party for dinner and the staff was so accommodating. We had 15 people and they sat us immediately. One of the party members was even gluten free and the waitress brought out a separate menu with several options. Love it! Don't forget to to order a pizookie - the best in town!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night with family and to sum up my experience: meh.

We ordered our food consisted of the baked pesto pasta (which was good, not spectacular spectacular) and the little cousins wanted the ridiculous 20 dollar holy-mother-of-pizza-pies and the server asked if this was our first time here and warned us that it would take 45 minutes. 

Why no, I did not know that, but thanks for pointing out that I am a certified noob here at Oreganos. 

My stomach almost screamed 'Ohnoyoudidnt' and my hand immediately snatched back the menu, going straight for the appetizers. The boom dip was pretty good, and for four people was enough. Probably my favorite dish of the night since I could actually taste chunks of artichoke unlike the usual artichoke dips that taste like I paid 10 bucks for 0.20 cents of straight melted mozzarella. For some reason, the server decided to torture us by serving both the pasta at the same time as the pizza even though we asked her not to. After an arduous hour of waiting where I was ready to part the crowd like Moses and run to Cherry Blossoms instead, the monster came and all I could see was a pile of cheese and oil dripping off the pan. I may be a fatty, but this goes beyond Paula Deen-'buttah'-level. The cousins and I all agreed that we could have gone to pizza hut, had the same delicious pizza, and eaten 5 more boxes in the time we waited.

Then, the little cousins wanted desert and they wanted the pizookie. I wish the waiter had warned us AHEAD of time that it was going to be another '15-esque minutes' but jk it's actually 25 minutes after ordering. By the time it got to our table, we were all too full and tired of being at a restaurant for so long. 

For a restaurant that's so small, you would think the food would come faster, or at least they would train their servers to be more careful about warning customers about the time it takes for certain foods to come out like other restaurants."}
{"text":"The frozen drinks were watered down, machine mix frozen beverages. The buffalo wings were pretty good but needed more sauce. The pizza was average at best and definitely too salty."}
{"text":"We had lunch today...First time there and Tylor was such an awesome waiter. The pizza was amazing and the guacamole was insane. This is our new fave pizza place."}
{"text":"Consistently slow and overpriced.  This has been our experience the two other times we have tried this place to some degree, but today takes the cake. We put in a carry out order around 5:20pm. When I placed our order (of two entrees and an app) they told me it would be 50 minutes before they could have it ready.  My husband went to pick it up at the time they provided.  Upon arriving he paid and waited...and waited...and finally asked them what was taking so long, which is when they informed him that they had forgotten to put our order in.  Third strike."}
{"text":"My husband's friends love this place and so does my husband - we came down to visit and this was one of the must-eat places.  

I have to admit it is pretty good, and the portions are huge.  I just got a turkey sandwich  - the bread was a little hard but it was massive and tasted pretty good.  I saved half of it for the next day and it was actually a bit better cos the bread had softened up.

The bellinis are strong and only $6.

Apparently they used to have this ravioli dish that was amazing but for some reason they took it off the menu which greatly disappointed my husband so I'm docking a star for that.

The best part is the pizookie of course - and it was that good.  I've had similar at BJ's but this one is much better."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants. I've eaten at the Tempe, Mesa, Old Town, and North Scottsdale locations and I've never been let down. The Tempe location was my first Oreganos experience and also the location I've been to the most. I have never had a bad meal at Oreganos and rarely had just ok meals. It literally has something everyone will like it just may take a few samples to get dialed in to your go to meal. The Pablo Picasso with chicken salad is my favorite salad that I have ever had and continues to be time and time again. The Big Rig Pasta with chicken is one of my favorite pastas anywhere as well. Both are slightly spicy but not to the point that it keeps my anti-spicy friends from enjoying it too. If I'm in a pizza mood a simple Oreganos thin crust pepperoni is delicious and always hits the spot! But my friends also rave about some of the more exotic pizza choices on the menu. Another friend favorite is the meatball sub which I've never heard a bad thing about. Finally, for dessert, the Pizza Cookie or Pizookie or whatever you call it is amazing! I am not a dessert person by any means but this thing is sooooo good! A perfectly slightly undercooked cookie topped with ice cream! Can't beat it! No matter how full you are from the enormous portions you can't leave without trying one of these masterpieces, you'll thank me after! Get one to share and it will disappear fast. I love the original chocolate chip cookie with vanilla but they also offer peanut butter and white chocolate macadamia. All my friends die for the white chocolate macadamia but I've never tried it because of my food allergy to macadamias. If you're thinking about eating here, go now!"}
{"text":"Pizza here was okay.. I ordered their wings and calamari for appetizers. Wings was decent and calamari was good. It's soft when you chew it unlike other calamari they're rubbery. I had their Puerto Penasco Carne Street Pie Pizza. I was really hungry after I finished the appetizers. I waited for at least half an hour till the pizza got to our table. I'll be honest I'm very impatient especially when it comes to food taking that long. No excuse. I had 2 small slices and after that I wasn't that hungry anymore cause the wait was too long. Pizza was okay and everything else. It didn't wow me especially the service. I'm not too sure if I will come back here."}
{"text":"Never had the pizza here, which is supposedly but they're known for, but I've had their alfredo. If you order the alfredo, you need to add the shredded chicken, it is amazing! Without the chicken, I think the alfredo would be your regular run of the mill alfredo. The chicken makes the dish a thousand times better and is so yummy! Their pizza cookie is the dessert to order. The negative is that they do not have frozen drinks. They have one frozen bellini but that is it as far as blended drinks go."}
{"text":"The guac-a-toni tho....

and don't get me started on pizooki's. 


Best place for a food baby."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza.  Tricked the kids into eating calamari by telling them they are squishy French fries.  Always a good place to come to."}
{"text":"Delicious food, tonight was my first visit and I will definitely be back. The pasta dishes are so good, I am excited to try their pizza next time. Quick service, and personable staff."}
{"text":"Really fun decorations.
Really sweet, high energy staff, fairly loud an upbeat atmosphere. 
Food is decent; large portions. Good pizza. 
Really good desert cookies!"}
{"text":"First time here ! Loved it for a quick snack! Yummy !it was a great place to stop and eat"}
{"text":"The top garlic death breath dining destination in the valley!  The bruschetta, garlic toast (with or without cheese), Italian flag lasagna, and pizzas... all get thumbs ups.  Some of the other pasta dishes are dry, come in stale bread bowls, or just lack cohesive flavors... so buyer beware - there are some landmines on the menu.  My suggestion... find your favorites and stick with them!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved the seating outdoors on the patio, the wonderful hostess and our waiter.  We felt welcome and invited.  We ended up having salads and pasta and we couldn't have asked for anything better!  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious! I had shrimp on my pasta and they were beautifully cooked and large shrimp, not the hunting for the seafood type.  We ended up splitting a Caesar salad between 3 people before our meal.  It was super fresh and a great start to our meal!  Hoping to return next October!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing and worth the wait! Pizza was divine and the staff was very friendly! We had the pasta, Big Rig and the shrimp dish. Can't remember name but the portions were huge! 4 to go boxes  and not because we didn't eat it, we were stuffed! Ordered a pan style pizza to go which looks amazing too! We waited about 20 minutes for a table on Friday night. Line out the entrance when we left so arrive early and hungry !"}
{"text":"I visit this location for lunch due to it being down the street from my work place.  It can be hit or miss but the misses tend to be frequent and consistent.  I LOVE their Caesar salad, mostly because they use anchovies in their dressing making it a true Caesar.  Their menu is not my jam, too much peppers and SW spice so I tend to stick to the same things on their menu which is the Caesar salad and pizza.  Their pizza cookie is a fav as well and it is a nice touch that they offer a complimentary one on your birthday.

The frequent and consistent problem I have is the freshness of the romaine lettuce.  Each time I get a salad there, I get old lettuce that is either so old it dried out and is crispy, or is so old it is on the verge of turning into slime.  They have a giant bin of lettuce that you can see in their kitchen so they are either not doing a good job of cleaning it, or are using old lettuce with the new.  I now go through my salad and pick out the old pieces so I don't get a surprise while I am eating."}
{"text":"Came for the wedding soup. The recipe changed and is thick and gelatinous and now served in a soggy pizza dough bowl. They tried to water down the soup for me and not serve it in the bread/dough bowl - what a joke. Still awful.  Bring back the old recipe- will not be back for the soup."}
{"text":"Am in town for my daughter's regionals gymnastics meet. 9 pm at night and we needed carbo loading for her to compete on next day. Hotel recommended Oregano's which was a pleasant surprise. We almost didn't stay as there was a 30 min wait and we needed to get the kid food and to bed, but as she was eagerly scrutinizing the menu selections, the hostess told us that 3 seats at the bar were opening up and we could order from full menu there. What a life saver! The hostesses were really friendly and nice.

Sat at bar and Matt served us. Gave us great and honest recommendations without being pushy. Was really friendly with good sense of humor. Was really efficient and on the ball too.  He made the experience so much better. From our seats, we could also see the Pit Crew making the pizza dough which was fun to watch.

The salads were wonderfully enormous as we eat a lot of salad! The three of us shared one large salad - can't remember name but was the special salad- really delicious. Then we got lasagna for kid and us parents ordered the Alfredo the Dark   
that Matt recommended which was very good, added sausage and chicken. Sizable  portions - still no room for dessert.

Overall, atmosphere was lovely, staff was friendly and terrific (esp Matt), food was filling and delicious, and we had a great time. We may go back tonight to try something else! :-)

Went back again tonight - ended up at the bar again.  Caitlyn served us and was fabulous - sense of humor, quick service, honesty - I think Oregano's is just great.  When I'm back in Phoenix, I'll be coming to this location.  FYI, ALL the staff are super-friendly."}
{"text":"Yummy we always get the dinner salad and sometimes the meatball sub!!!! Plus DUH a PAZOOKI!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza chain anywhere.  Always good, dependable and friendly service.  These guys know how to hire right.  Love the thin crust and a great selection of toppings.  Whenever in the Valley of the Sun we find a way to stop in to one of the locations."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch.  We were seated in a dark alcove right next to the noisy kitchen pick up station.  Ordered cocktails that were very weak.  Ordered sausage cheese pizza and were surprised when the sausage looked liked dried bacon bits from a jar."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Highly recommend the Numero ONE-O Stuffed Pizza:
A combo of homemade sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions & green peppers makes one incredible pizza!  Also Lawrence's Stuffed 'Shrooms
We take portobella mushrooms and stuff them with our Italian sausage, Oregano's marinara, thinly sliced basil, our 4 cheese blend, fresh diced roma tomatoes and a little bit of cilantro. Incredible! Atmosphere is casual and relaxed. Excellent wait staff at this location. Go check them out!"}
{"text":"This review corresponds to my first Check-In to Oregano's. 

Outside of the wait times, I've not had a bad experience @ Oreganos. The food was good, the people were friendly and I had a good time. This visit was no exception. Even when my wife got meat in her minestrone soup, the situation was handled impressively well. I've known for years that my wife is a VERY picky eater when dining out, she left all smiles and so did I.

It's one of few places I go to with \"stuff\" on the walls that I don't find obnoxious.  

Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We ordered a simple margarita thin pizza. What we got was a tasteless barely cheesy tomato pizza on  the thinnest piece of motza-like crust. This restaurant doesn't know what real pizza is. Holy cow! We put everything we could imagine on top of it to make it taste like something. We tried adding salt ,we tried oregano ,we tried crushed hot pepper. The salt helped a little bit.Never mind the half hour wait just to be seated and then another one hour to wait for the not so hot from the oven pizza to be delivered to our table. They were kind enough to comp us for the pizza. I would not go back again."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying it takes a lot for me to complain, but to me the little things that happen in a restaurant make the experience even better than just great tasting food. When I had first heard an oreganos opened up on the west I was super excited!!! After reading others reviews though I'll admit that I was hesitant about trying this location out but... I went for it anyways with my boyfriend and a couple of friends. Our friends had made it there first and called and informed us it would be an hour wait! But non of them had ever been there and I assured them it was completely worth the wait! Once we say down we waited a good 10-15 minutes to be greeted by a server ( working in the restaurant business, I found this very weird), while waiting for our server I noticed about 4 different staff meme era just standing and talking doing absolutely nothing! I'm more than positive they could have found something to do with how busy the restaurant was. 
   Once I waitress greeted us she was very nice and I thought okay she's gonna turn this experience around real quick, but she took our drink order and disappeared for 10 minutes! Once she she brought us our drinks she asked if we were ready to order, we said no and she looked kind of irritated I have a habit of reading peoples facial expressions so noticing this bothered me very much. 
    We eventually ordered and when we did she informed us that all the food would take about 1 hour and if we didn't mind, I. My mind I was thinking we waited an hour just to be seated then another 25 minutes to order, why wouldn't we wait. We had ordered a big Cesar salad and wings so she asked if we wanted that to come out first and we said yeah that would be amazing! But just for wings and a salad it took almost 30 mintues!!! 
    I could believe how long it took for all our food, I had never waited this long at the Phoenix location. Another thing that bothered me was a hostess asked a table next to us if they needed a high chair, they said yes. I watched this hostess grab a high chair proceed to drag, yes drag it loudly across the floor interrupting multiple tables conversations, three different tables including ours were starring yet she continued not to care and just drag the high chair across the floor!
    I would just have to say I was not impressed at all with anything at this location! The food was ehh, the staff was rude and looked like they didn't know what to do half the time, and just the time it took to prepare some wings, a salad, 11' pizza and pasta was ridiculous! This location has been open for months, and problems like this should be resolved! Sadly I will never go back to this location if rather drive the 1 hour out to Phoenix."}
{"text":"After having some poor experiences at this location  i spoke with Beth, managing partner, and expressed my concerns. I decided to give them another try and i'm really glad I did. The salads we ordered were fantastic. Piled high with fixings and had spot on flavors. If you have had a bad experience before i suggest politely expressing your concerns and giving them another try. I'm sure you wont be disappointed, i certainly was not. Thanks Beth!"}
{"text":"great patio at this location i must say. Coming in with a large party made things quite hectic but once we got seated we were getting service right away.

Food was excellent and service was mediocre. Food came out at different times and one sandwhich had something in it that was blue and spongy. I didnt have any problems with my food but the manager comp'd the other plate for the person who had an issue with it. Overall food was good but there was a lot of employees running around not knowing whats going on. You could tell the place had just opened and the employees werent in the groove of things yet."}
{"text":"The Chicken Lasagna was awful and left me gassy and burping for hours afterwards.  I thought I was going to be sick.  The worst.  Waste of money.  Get it off the menu--like frozen food.  I should have sent it back--would have had I knew what the after effects would be.

If pizza is what you are great for, make pizzas! and don't try to be all things to all people with a giant mediocre menu of other things because when I order food, I expect it to be very good to excellent. 

There is a large easy free parking lot, nice outdoor patio, very friendly attentive service. I sat at the bar and the bartender was the best.

Men's restroom was okay, not the cleanest, but okay for a casual meal restaurant. 

I think if I was coming here, I would stick with the pizza and don't get fancy with the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Best first time experience! The staff was extreme friendly and welcoming. The service was fast and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Oregano's used to be better. 
I used to love it... 
The atmosphere and the pizza were excellent, and now it seems like they are sub par. I've been there a handful of times this year, and every one of them have been disappointing. the service was lousy, and the food was mediocre at best. But on the bright side, they do have giant cups so I can drink a gallon of coke while I wait 45-1 hour for my pizza to come out."}
{"text":"Good food, usually get it to go, sometimes the staff manning the counter at the registers are a little clueless but not bad."}
{"text":"My family and I had high hopes for this place as we were looking for a nice \"new\" little lunch/dinner spot.  I know it is a chain and you should only expect so much, however this was quite the let down. Here are my points:
1) service was very slow. It took 30 min. for a cheese pizza to come to the table
2) the cheese pizza we ordered looked as if it was made on a tortilla or possibly some sort of flat bread.  A big salad and 12 inch pizza should have filled my family of four up, however I found self scavenging for pizza bones. I almost asked the guy in the booth just next to me if I could share some of his meal. 
Long and short of it is that the appeal is most likely to Chicago \"Transients\" who like deep dish pizza and I swore off \"Pizza Hut\" years ago.  I knew I should not have passed up a slice of pepperoni from Costco for the crackers and cheese from here."}
{"text":"If I could eat out somewhere everyday, this would be the place. The cheesy garlic bread appetizer is a large loaf that comes to the table and you rip off pieces and dip in marinara sauce. It's to die for! The pesto pasta bread bowl is my favorite! Everything I've tried off the menu has been amazing, Oregano's never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Okay I need to start my review of Oregano's with a few comments that I have read in other reviews here. Don't really know if some of these comments were made during the initial grand opening of the store when things can be challenging, but possibly so.

First of all these restaurants are very, very popular in the  the Phoenix area, and evidently Surprise is no exception. We went on a Friday night and yes it was mobbed. When many people walk in your door there at once of course will be a significant wait. Just a tip though you can get immediate seating in the bar if seats are open at anytime which is what we did. Add on to that wait if you do order the Oregano's pan pizza, this is Chicago deep dish style pizza and does take a lot longer to cook and does have a significantly higher amount of cheese and toppings on it. So to have to wait longer and pay more is only natural. Of couse if you want Papa John's style fast food pizza, this is not the place to come but if you want special Pizza then get the pan. You pay for what you get. We had the pan pizza with pepperoni sausage jalapenos and extra garlic. And it was delicious. When you order this they tell you how long it will take and it usually runs about 45 minutes depending on how busy and backed up the kitchen is. A good way to pass the time is to have a drink and one of their monster salads. Believe me the time will fly. We had \"Oregano's Favorite\" that was huge and very delicious. It had Romaine Lettuce, chicken breast, sliced kalamatta olives, pine nuts, red peppers, garlic croutons, and Bermuda onions, and it was covered with a great Honey Vinegarette dressing. They also sprinkle on all the fresh parmesan you want. Me and my wife had several servings each and still took half of it home in a box. 

And then the Pizza came. Ours was exceptional and I would recommend it highly. Beautiful new restaurant just built there recently and the service was amazing. And no I don't work there, lol."}
{"text":"Water- 0/10
Ice- 0/10

This place literally takes the cake as having the WORST water I've ever consumed. It's not even the normal shitty tap you expect at most places. Only took one sip and it felt like I had someone else's saliva in my mouth. 
And to make matters worse, the ice cubes were completely useless because the water was still warm.

Service was good. Food was delicious. Bring your own water."}
{"text":"My wife and I have made this place part of our routine Mesa haunts. We don't go there every week; but we go there enough to know that you wait for a table unless it is before 5 p.m. or a weekday. I usually gravitate to heartier fare, and since I LOVE pesto I could only recommend the Pesto Penne Bake; I usually get it with sausage. My better half always gets the \"Alfredo The Dark\" which is a spicy southern style alfredo; if you like heat and alfredo, this is a perfect marriage of the two!! We don't get drinks but half of the time we do get a Pizookie and the bill never makes it above $40.00. That being said, I almost forgot; if you like cookies than you better try the Pizookie!! This is the best fresh outta' the oven cookie with ice cream that not even your own Mom could ever replicate!!! I have seen Pizookie addicts, hell I married one!!! Let me tell you, once you have tried the pizookie you will understand the Cookie Monster's struggle!!"}
{"text":"Everything we get here is good. We love the jalepeno raviolis and pesto pizza, but it doesn't matter if it's the salad or deep dish. This is our regular Football Sunday food."}
{"text":"The Greatest Pizza served in a truly FUN atmosphere by staff with a most outstanding Customer Orientation.  You cannot help but really enjoy and become a fan of Oreganos!"}
{"text":"I had a delightful meal. Service was great. I love the casual atmosphere. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. I enjoyed the music and taped scenes of Sinatra. I hope you give this place a try once. If nothing else, you will walk out with a smile."}
{"text":"Got excited about trying this place. We're not big on Pizza but there are other entrees...  not many but some. We figured, well, not a huge selection but maybe they do those few things really great!!  NOOOOOOOOOO.... not the case. I can't say about the pizza... but, we started with a side salad which was excellent - I had such high hopes for dinner!  Shortly there after we received our  Bruschetta Authentico (hmmm... reverse order)...  these was a huge plate of bread and the bruschetta mix. It was bland & tasteless and way too oily.  I live for bruschetta when I go to Italian Restaurants but skip this in the future - we even reread the descriptions a number of times trying to figure out why it was so horrible..... tomatoes were not rip for starters but the spices were just not right.  

Now enter what they call Italian Flag Lasagna. It was simply the worst Lasagna we ever had. My dinner companion loves Lasagna and rarely complains about anything. He stopped eating it and pushed it aside as well and I had to ask him if his was as bad as mine was.  We both got it and neither of us could literally \"choke it down.\" The noodles were mush and the entire Lasagna had been obviously pre-cooked and microwaved. Costco frozen lasagna is better than this sorry excuse for an entree.  We basically asked the \"manager\" if anyone was looking at the items coming out of the kitchen because it simply shouldn't have been served. While they did not charge us for these items it is a sad state of affairs when an Italian place can't figure out lasagna.

We decided to strike Oregano's from our dinner list...."}
{"text":"My only wish would be that there was one of these in Huntington Beach, Ca. We were tired, hot and hungry after the Cubs/Angels spring training game, and searched on yelp for the best Pizza place nearby, we drove by a few, and being a little picky..we thank goodness waited til we saw Oregano's. I am so glad we did. The service was awesome, Meagan from Colorado, a senior at ASU was our waitress, and was so great!
2 managers walked by at different times asking how we were doing, as i said great service.
The food was excellent! the thin crust Pizza was the best i have had.
Just wish there was one closer so we could try more of the menu."}
{"text":"For the longest time I wouldn't eat at Oreganos because when I had it in the past, I did not like it. Decided to try it out again and was very happy with my meal. We had a Caesar Salad, Alfredo The  Dark Pasta, and a pizookie of course. The salad was great, I don't always like Caesar dressing. The pasta was really great too. Change my opinion of Oregano's."}
{"text":"This was from my 11 year-old son...as written for a school project:  (Grammer and spelling updates were made to make it readable).  

The time I went to Oreganos the food was fantastic.  The service was great because the food didn't take long to make.  They presented it like they meant it.  The atmosphere was really cool because they have little TV's that play the old black and white movies.  I would recommend it because the food is fantastic!"}

{"text":"When I lived in Arizona a million years ago, an Oregano's took over my favorite little local bar-ish place. I boycotted them for six months (which worked out fine - the place was packed all the time) until a friend insisted we go. Then I wanted to eat all the things on the menu. I never got their deep dish pie, though, having always had deep dish that is at least 1/3 bread, and not even good bread. Well, while back in the area for graduation I told my husband that Oregano's makes a deep dish that takes (and they're not lying) at least 45 minutes to make. He was insistent, so we got one. OMG, I deprived myself for so long! Why?? A piece is a meal into itself, but so worth it. With the toppings in the middle, a supporting center crust, and the sauce on top, you get a slab of deliciousness without a giant chunk of bread. Go. Go now. Wait your hour but know it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I am happy to update my review and raise a star on both service and food. We went in on our anniversary which also happened to be a graduation night. It was super packed with large parties but we were able to get a seat at the bar. The food was a huge improvement over our last visit ranking right up there with the other locations we have visited. Yes-there is still a huge wait but we have waited at the other locations too. It's a popular place. The only thing holding back a five star rating is the fact that they still seem a little understaffed. The poor bartender was running her butt off trying to take care of everyone and she just couldn't. Keep moving in the right direction! We are happy to have this restaurant in Goodyear b"}
{"text":"We have been in the Phoenix area for a couple years and I have wanted to try Oregano's for quite some time but we are never close to one. We have been watching the location in Goodyear being built and I couldn't wait any longer so we drove to Glendale specifically to eat here. I am happy to say that our experience totally exceeded our expectations. 
We had a bit of a wait when we arrived around 4pm. I was surprised at how busy it was at that time of day. I was hopeful that was a good sign. 
Once we were seated we were greeted by our awesome server Jeff. He was very welcoming and gave us some great suggestions. We ordered garlic cheese bread for our appetizer, pepperoni and olive pan style pizza and the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream for dessert. 
I honestly could have just had the garlic cheese bread and been totally satisfied. It was delicious and tasted so fresh. The pizza was amazing! I can't wait to try more of their pies! The dessert was soooo good. Even though I was full I couldn't resist the dessert. 
On top of the delicious food our server Jeff was fantastic. He could not have been any more friendly or attentive. If you decide to stop in ask for him and I am sure you will be delighted. I can't wait for the Goodyear location to open and I hope the service is as good as it was at this location."}
{"text":"Salads, pizza and pasta are all good choices.  The salads are huge and serve 2 adults easily.  Best bet for a couple is split a salad and pizza for a meal.

Always satisfying.  The dessert cookie is a great option, again, probably best when shared with a friend."}
{"text":"Cozy and truely italian!! This place took my amusement for an italian lunch to the next level. The interiors are so pretty and vintage. They have an old television playing near the bar and that makes you feel you are somewhere in the 60's. The food-mama mia!! Lip smacking and authentic italian."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner although the servings are always huge! I suggest a \" senior serving\" added to the menu.
Waiter and staff superb service ."}
{"text":"Server was awesome. Pizza, while extremely thin,  was tasty, though lacking the extra cheese I ordered. Sure was on the bill, though.  That one slice was $9!!!! Wth?!
Moscow mule - tastes like straight ginger ale.  Welp, satisfied my curiosity."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for lunch! My friend and I split a Big Rig with chicken and a Pizzookie. Slam dunk!"}
{"text":"Hands down...stack it up with the best pizza in AZ.  (Chicago style). First time and I tried the pan.   Sauce A. Crust A. Cheese A.  Incredible, but so filling!  

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If there are more than 4 people in your party, DO NOT GO HERE. I called at 4:30 on a Wed. to make reservations for a party of 7. They do not take reservations. We arrived at 5:20 and were told there would be a 45 minute to 1 hour wait. I figured that, in one hour, they could turn over almost every table in the restaurant. So we waited. And waited. Finally, we were seated after an hour and a half wait. It was so ridiculous that I checked the time when our food was served. 7:40 - 2 hours and 20 minutes after we arrived.  The food was fine, but the wait just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"We looked to Yelp for dinner ideas while we were in Chandler during Spring Break. Best decision of the trip! The pizza was fantastic (love thin crust pizzas) and the salad was amazing. Everyone was happy and full when we left. So good!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, the pizza zesty and delicious. The prices were reasonable. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love pizza. Seriously. Some of the best pizza and really everything. The wings are phenomenal! Wings are great and so is Oreganos. Seriously, go here, the price is great and so is the food"}
{"text":"My family has always received great service and food at the Superstition Springs location."}
{"text":"Very popular place. Had lunch today. Great service and food. Plan to be very hungry or take some home. We arrived a few minutes before noon and were seated immediately."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant I have ever been to. Mind you, I am not a picky eat whatsoever but this food was awful. We ordered two lasagna dishes and it looked like the food had been put in a blender and slapped on the plate. It was so soggy. Almost like eating meat flavored jello. There are way better restaurants out there."}
{"text":"I have had good experiences at this location (Tempe). Service is prompt, and the staff is extremely professional. Moreover, this location is open later at night -- when compared to other Oregano locations.

My four favorites are the \"Italian Gold wings,\" \"Numero One-O,\" \"Bistro Sweet Po's,\" and French Fries. 

The Italian Gold wings are chicken wings cooked with a honey mustard BBQ sauce. The Numero One-O is a stuffed pizza with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and green onions. 

The Bistro Sweet Po's are sweet potato fries. And as for the French Fries, they are crispy and ruffled! 

Oh yes, and DO try the dessert. I recommend the Chocolate Chip dessert, which is essentially a hot pizza cookie -- made entirely of chocolate chip. 

Prices from about $5 to $9 for appetizers. Pizza prices range from about $14 to $23. 

There are also lasagnas, pastas, and sandwiches -- all of which are good."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this particular Oregano's location (Scottsdale at Shea). Although the food was very good, the service was lacking. 

Initially, our waitress was prompt with bringing beverages out. However, after our meal was delivered, our waitress disappeared; we never see her again. We inquire to another waiter, who then lets us know that our waitress had taken a break. 

Nonetheless, the food was good. My four favorites are the \"Italian Gold wings,\" \"Numero One-O,\" \"Bistro Sweet Po's,\" and French Fries.

{"text":"Been to Oregano's multiple times- love the place overall- but today ordered the Vino Bambino. This was (from the menu description) supposed to be a mixture of multi color pasta w/black olives, romaine lettuce, scallions, chicken, red peppers and sun dried tomatoes. Asked for no scallions, the waitress came back and said the scallions were already in the pasta salad so I said that's ok then- fully expecting to get what I ordered- unfortunately I didn't. There was absolutely no pasta salad, no red peppers, no black olives. Definitely not what I ordered. Unfortunate :("}
{"text":"Amazing food! Authentic tasting Chicago style pizza. The wait time for your food is a lengthy, but totally normal for this style. Cute decor! Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The only thing I don't like about oreganos is the sticker price of a pizza. Because of that we only eat there a couple times a year. It's hard to justify $30+ bucks for a pie. We always get chicago style deep dish which does not disappoint. It's the real deal Chicago style."}
{"text":"Long wait. But worth it! Best food I have ever eaten. Friendly staff. Get the pesto penne pasta bread bowl! Enough food for two!"}
{"text":"CHEATERS!   ....i. Will not support a business that lies right to my face. Was going to go to oreganos for my birthday with Renae when I thought I'd have their Margarita, waitress says sorry were out of house tequila. I point out the fact that the menu clearly says in two different ways they use \"top shelf\" very nicely because I'm very confused. She leaves and a bartender returnes and leans down on the table over me and asks what the problem is? I explain and he says they \" talk them up to sell them, and if I want top shelf it's more $\" and then just stared down at me when I said that's clearly lying and actually had to tell him to move and get out of my face so we could leave.... was looking forward to eating there but I don't know if your going to lie about that what else are they doing...
Thanks El Cantos for a wonderful birthday dinner!!
Oregano's Pizza Bistro ... I hope you read this and fix it... and talk to. your bartender how to treat people."}
{"text":"GREAT place, AMAZING staff. Walked in and had some great dishes and an amazing server. Evan killed it. He helped us out, and really made us feel happy and at home! Even though we're lactose intolerant at an Italian restaurant, he did everything he could to help us find the best option for our needs. Mike also helped us out and didn't make us feel bad at all for needing some alternative options! They are there to help make the night great for the customer! And the food was delicious! The pesto pasta is to die for and the Big Rig dish is a must! (Both have cheese though, it was worth the risk) 
He helped us out with the cocktails and beer list, and definitely knows his way around beers in AZ! (As a San Diego native, that was a great plus!) again, food was great, and Evan and mike did an awesome job making us feel at home."}
{"text":"I think every Phoenix resident has been to oreganos. Pizza is good but not amazing. The pizza-cookie is hands down the best dessert ive ever had. 

I just dont understand how this place is 24/7 busy with people waiting crazy time periods to sit down. We went at 3:30! today and it was still busy as hell. I gusss its a good problem to have"}
{"text":"We went to this Oreganos on a weeknight. We had their \"big\" salad and had plenty to share between the two of us. The pizza was great! Nice thin crust and great flavor.  The beer selection is great too. Service was exceptional and the atmosphere is nice!"}
{"text":"This place was packed when we came here... And that was on a Sunday. So be prepared for a wait for a table, unless you do what we did and sit in the bar. The service is good- drinks were always refilled, etc. I did find it strange they didn't have any TVs in the bar so if you're going there to watch a game you will be disappointed. The deep dish pizza takes about 45 minutes to cook, so be prepared to wait. It's worth the wait though.  Very tasty. Just don't do what I did once- order the cheese bread and then be full when the pizza comes. The cheese bread is huge. One other thing to not about this location- parking sucks and getting in there can be difficult depending on which side of the street you come from."}
{"text":"I think I might have screwed up when we came here and we accidentally got the thin crust instead of the deep dish.  It was good, but if you have the time you should really order the deep dish from here. It's one of the few deep dish pizzas I like.  It does take a while to cook.  Also, it sometimes takes a while to get a table here so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Delicious! Very friendly, great service and food.

They get you seated as fast as possible and they use the \"skip the line\" feature on Yelp which is great.

Best restaurants in the valley!

This location is amazing inside as well as the patio."}
{"text":"Oregano's.... you know, everyone in Phoenix has probably been to Oregano's, it's like a Phoenix institution. I got take out from this location and it was tasty, nothing crazy, but just what I'd expect after years of eating at Oregano's. We had the hot wings ('of fire'), and they were a little weird tasting but certainly hot, the stuffed rigatoni (tasty pasta with even tastier garlic bread), and the chicken Caesar salad, which is, by far, my favorite item at Oregano's. The chicken Caesar is so good because the chicken is spicy and delicious...that's it. This is a must order. Will I be at Oregano's again? Of course I will. 


PS Pizza here isn't that great, you gotta know what to order."}
{"text":"Love Oregano's Pizza having eaten at the Tempe (University Drive) restaurant many a times. So I was hoping to expect the same service as I've always when I visited the Camelback restaurant. Unfortunately, it wasn't to be. 

Firstly, the hostess had us waiting unnecessarily, stating that our our outside table was being prepared. That wasn't the case as they only had one customer in the patio. When I asked the hostess how long it will be, she probably realised the pointless wait and directed us to 1 of 6 free tables. 

When we got to the table, it was dirty with specs of leftover pizza from the precious dining. Our waitress was not very helpful either when asked for recommending  vegetarian pizzas. The water which was brought to us was in filthy glasses and we had to send one of them back. The pizzas took more than 30 mins, which seemed a bit much for a couple of regular pizzas. We were told things are hectic between 3-5pm and that the oven was an old type which made things lesser efficient than the ones in Tempe. 

When the pizza finally arrived, it was ok. But by then it didn't really matter. 

So overall, pretty disappointed with the service. Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"First visit to this new Oregano's restaurant and we're so impressed with the outstanding service. Ordered the Picasso salad, a deep dish Uno pizza, a thin pizza and chocolate chip cookie with ice cream for dessert. All was so amazing we ate way too much.  The atmosphere and music were standard Oregano's style, charming. Continues to be our favorite pizza joint!"}
{"text":"The Margherita Pizza here is pretty good! Thin Crust and a lot of toppings. Just a little over cooked, but very delicious. Also I ordered the Pablo Picasso salad, and it's extremely delicious. Overall a family friendly restaurant and very friendly waiters. 4 out of 5 is my review."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here multiple times. We always have a wonderful meals. It's kid friendly and very fast and simple service. The only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is every time we are in. We feel rushed. Like eat it and beat it. I hate that. I don't want to be there all night either. But when you appetizers comes out with your main course, this will give that perception. I totally understand that waiters need to turn over tables, but I just got here. I want to relax and actually enjoy my food and my family's company."}
{"text":"1st time here Josh our waiter was nice, fast, and not a pest. told us our mushrooms would take a little while due to being baked ,good to know  Wife loved the sandwich, pizza was awesome and everything was great thanks again Josh  recommend to anyone that wants a great lunch ..."}
{"text":"6 PM Monday evening. Fairly busy. Ordered the Chicken Lasagna. A long wait for slightly warm food. Bread was cold and dry. Lasagna was dry, sauce was not well prepared. Tasted like tomato paste with a few dry herbs ground in with no prep involved for flavor."}
{"text":"Guaca-Tony. 

Full bar. 

SanTan on tap. 

Chain restaurant clutter on the walls. 

I actually really enjoy this restaurant and the location is clean. There was a wait so I checked in on Yelp and it worked out perfectly. 

I haven't had a bad experience at an Oreganos yet, so I recommend. Also it's my wife's favorite chain, and when she's happy, I'm happy."}
{"text":"This place is comparable to Buca di Beppo.

Definitely for the masses."}
{"text":"I am not sure what they did to my beloved Oregano's at this location but I do not like it at all. Not sure if they are playing with the recipe or what but the crust tastes like a board. Also, there was not as much sauce on the pizza as we usually get at other locations. We had the Italian gold wings as an appetizer and they were good but the pizza was a big thumbs down. We went in Tucson a few nights ago and it was great. This location is a different story."}
{"text":"The staff here is always freindly, kind and caring. We get the same food most all the time. Big beefstro salad is what we had. Always made right, always consistent. Big 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I love it here. the vibe here is pretty upbeat, the crew's T-shirts are great. \"Legalize Marinara.\"  I love it. Both times I've been in I was served by Anissa. Once co-served by John. The experience couldn't be better. The food was served piping hot, the service was absolutely wonderful. The servers seem genuine in their charisma, charm and joy of serving. 

My first trip, I had the Rig-a Tony. absolutely fabulous. The rigatoni was cooked al dente, the sauce was phenomenal, and the cheese melted and browned on top. Mmmm..mmm!

My second trip in, I had the angel hair pasta with meat sauce and a gigantic meatball. Again, the sauce was phenomenal. The pasta was cooked just right and the Meatball was crazy good. 

I love the display of old paintings and other old knick-knacks, it really reminds me of Grandma's house. I love that the recipes are the families own instead of a manufactured replica of a family tradition.

And finally, I love the management here. Cynthia has a smile that lights up the room. Her professionalism is unmatched, as I've seen her in action with an unsavory guest. Handling the situation with vigor and resolve, yet still hitting the floor, if you will, unscathed. 

 I would serious recommend anyone wanting GREAT Italian food and attentive, joyful service to come here. And always remember T I P S = To Insure Proper Service. Tip your server, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Oregano's numerous times in Phoenix (more than I can count), in Scottsdale, Flagstaff, and Tucson. I know what Oregano's is supposed to taste like. This location is just OK. I live out here and have been there five times now. The service is fine but the wait times are ludicrous. Many times, it seems contrived by the management. Open tables everywhere and more people standing outside than seated. The worst here is the Pizza Cookies. They consistently come out raw. I have sent them back several times to have them cooked more and inquired as to why they cannot get them right. They tell me they have a different oven than the other locations so they cannot get them crispy. Sounds like a quality control/consistency problem that senior management needs to look at!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows Oreganos has great food yadda, yadda...I wanted to write this review to highlight the excellent service we received from our waiter. We came in late last night, around 10 pm. We we're greeted right away, he was super friendly, he kept up on the refills, boxed our food up, offered us to go cups for our drinks, and he even assisted me in getting the wristband off me from an event we just went to! Great service! Here's the issue though...we didn't catch his name and my bf couldn't find the receipt. So if a manager is reading this he has close cropped dark hair and black glasses, young handsome guy, and he was working the little covey to the far right on 10/25. We actually tried to find a manager after we left but we were one of the last tables and I think everyone was in the back. He deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"The pizza (had the thin crust, bistro classic) was no better than what you can get from a CPK's frozen pizza.  They deep fried their chicken wings to death.  It was dry and hard to bite into the drumettes.  Waited for the pizza for 40 minutes upon ordering.  This place is old and run down.  This is my first and final visit to this joint.  

If you want real pizza, go to Pomo's Pizzeria, Cibo's, or Pizzeria Bianco."}
{"text":"the only thing that exceeds this staff's professionalism is their enthusiasm and fun!  

huge portions!   one meal can last one person 2 nights. 

The only thing I have to suggest is they get a larger draft beer selection.

Don't come for the chicken wings. stick with the PIZZA and PASTA! 

It will always be a repeat visit when I'm in scottsdale !"}
{"text":"Slow service when it wasn't busy, and pizza was average this time. I hadn't been back for 3 years, a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner!  The kids loved playing with the pizza dough.  We went early and got immediate seating, but the wait was an hour long when we left.  We'll definitely be back!  Fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Oh my friggin stars, this place is ridiculously good. After my first bite of Alfredo the Dark, I became angry at the entire valley for not forcing me to try this place earlier! But my anger was quickly overcome by my newfound love for diced tomatoes.

Seriously, I hate tomatoes in non-sauce form, but I love these tomatoes. They danced amid the noodles like little red morsels of pure joy.

I couldn't finish my meal. I'm a 300+ lb. man. But I had to save space, because I was about to be introduced to the Pazooki.

Me and my tiny female work friend shared the Pazooki. She devoured it as fast as I did. We tore that thing up. Usually I'd care about things like whether someone else's spoon touched a certain piece of food, but not today my friend. Not today."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would!! Tonight was my birthday and I was give a gift card for Oregano's. The service was so slow and it was not that busy!! The food was also horrible. Pizza was so dry and tasted funny. Even my kids wouldn't eat it. We told the waiter the cheese pizza was not good, clearly because we had not eaten any of it! He just said ok and never offered to replace it or refund my $$ for the pizza. We ordered an 18\" half cheese half numero-uno or some kind of weird name. Lol anyways the pizza cost $27 and my husband was the only person who ate some of it. Unfortunately the waiter only got an eighteen cent tip because I was so pissed!! I'm usually a great tipper but I was mad that I spent $50 on a crappy birthday dinner!! I will not be going back!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! Woah.. Woah.. WOah...Woah. WOW!! Oh my gosh!!

Great Pizza, great pasta! I had to take some home back to California!  
Next time my bf and I are in AZ, thats definitely one place we are going back to."}
{"text":"food was decent. server was nice. but, there were a lot of flies in the restaurant, and we had to take food to go, and ate at home. couldn't enjoy the food there with all the flies."}
{"text":"Antipasto salad is delicious and huge. Definitely makes 2 meals."}
{"text":"Oreganos, oh how I love thee!  I been going to Oreganos around the valley for at least 13 years- could be more.  I have made my hubby, the kids and my extended family fans.  When celebrating birthdays and we don't feel like cooking this is typically the family pick.  Ok so here is why I love you.  Salads yum, have tried most but currently stuck on the Pablo Picasso ( add avocado), your wings - medium gold yummy!!!  Pizza nom nom and of course the best half baked cookie ever!! Let's not forget the bellinis who must have crack in them because they are addictive.  Only complaint is the two drink minimum on them.  Yes really!!! 

Oh and lastly the service is always on point.  Never have we had a bad server and that says a whole lot."}
{"text":"After getting a cup of coffee at a local coffee shop in downtown Phoenix, my friend and I decided to visit a friend in tempe and got hungry on the way there so we all decided to grab pizza and someone suggested the oreganos on university Dr. So we went ahead and arrived and asked for a table at 7:05pm and were told there was a 25-30 mins wait but we didn't mind because there was a cool little thrift store 5 mins away so we went ahead and left. At 7:25 we got a txt saying our table was ready and got seated by 7:30ish, we didn't place our food order until 7:40pm and waited a very long time for our food to arrive, it wasn't packed or anything. At 8:55 we finally got our food! We were just praying it was the best goddang pasta in the world because we did wait an hour and 15 mins to arrive, we were joking and laughing and just having a good time catching up time went by fast. I ordered the bollo pasta and I couldn't eat more than 2 bites because it felt like I was chewing on rosemary,I asked the waiter to please exchange my food for something else and asked for the pizza cookie which by the way was really good but also took 25 mins to arrive at the table, bummer!! And lets not even mention the Anita Margarita  was just plain gross. We left at around 9:50-10pm and we dropped off our friend and 45 mins later he texted me saying he had gotten food poisoning and so did my other friend and I. So I don't know how exactly they prep their good but there was something in it that made us all sick. I'd recommend oreganos but definitely NOT this location. The service was poor and the food didn't taste like it was cooked right and on top of it, we all got food poisoning, I had to pull over to the side of the freeway to vomit the two bites of pasta I had for dinner and the pizza cookie I shared with my two other friends."}
{"text":"I love this location. The atmosphere is great and the staff is wonderful. While I'm not a huge fan of their pizzas as I'm a New York pizza type of person, the pasta and garlic bread is great. I recommend trying the penne bake and the bowlo pasta. Add meatballs to whatever you can because they are very delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Fun place to eat. Great bruschetta.
Casual atmosphere with a good portion is Italian decor.
Good bet for a family or travel guests meal."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  I have been traveling to Tempe for work for the last 4 weeks and this place has killed every meal I have had (4 so far).  

First, best chicken wings EVER!!!  Crispy, spicy, and all drummettes.  Lips are still on fire and cannot wait to go back for more.

Second, for those on a diet---Beefarito salad is sooooooo good. Filling, wonderful flavor, huge pieces of spinach and low fat dressing.  MMMMMmmmmm.

Third, the smell of pizza is overwhelming.  I caved the first time and got a stuffed Chicago pizza that was out of this world.  Now I get the above-mentioned salad and I feel beyond satiated.  I would love it if they did pizza by the slice...hint....hint....

Finally, the NICEST waitresses/waiters!!!  Helpful, friendly, cute and attentive.

Legalize Marinara!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Oregano's!  It's one of my favorite restaurants and my wife and I go there often.  The food is great, the service and staff are excellent!  My only complaint would be that they are often so busy that you have to wait for extended periods and they don't take reservations.  But the food is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Their patio was not open and could not seat me out there. I simply wanted to read a book and have some cocktails but, the offer to sit at the bar is a entirely too loud to read and relax.

The patio is all set up and light. I don't see why they could not seat someone there.

Meh, carabas down the street has an open patio though, I wish Oreganos was open though. Otherwise looks like a decent place."}
{"text":"I come to this location more than I care to admit, at least once a week. I love the food and love the fact that some of the staff members not only know my name but always stop what they are doing to come and say hi, always very nice people. Today was different, when I called to place my order, it took forever to get someone to answer the phone, then when they did all I could hear where females laughing and joking but not actually talking to me; finally a male took the call and I was able to place my order. Since I was only ordering an appetizer I was told it would be ready in 20 min, however, I asked if they could delay my order 10 min which they agreed. Once I went to pick up my order, 35 minutes after I placed it, my food was still not ready.... I figured, no big deal, I will wait. As I waited, the male employee who was helping me asked me if I wanted something to drink and gave me a to go cup of water since that is all I wanted. He was very pleasant even though I had to wait almost an extra 15 min for my food to be ready. I happen to live right across Oregano's, so as soon as I got home, I took the lid off my cup to take some of the ice out and to my dismay, there was a dead fly inside my cup!!! So this whole time I had been drinking contaminated water :(. I called Oregano's and asked to spoke to a manager, they connected me to Shelley (not sure of her name) and after I explained what had happened, she started laughing! She proceeded to say \"well, we all have had our share of accidents\". I asked her if she found it that funny and if she did not realize how dirty flies are and how much bacteria or illnesses they can carry. The manager proceeded to say \"oh I am sorry, I will take something off your ticket\", she than proceed to deduct $10 dlls of my $20 dlls bill.... You would think that for such health violation, not only would they have comped my meal but that she would have been a bit more concerned and more apologetic. Even though I looove this place and its food, they have just lost one of their most loyal customers. Oregano's should have better management who actually know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Love oreganos big beefy sandwich it has lot of veggies in it and comes with cheese I don't eat the veggies but it is to die for this sandwich is the ultimate sandwich it is a big full of beef ready to be eaten if you go there it is a must try that Alfredo after Dark with chicken have a great time there and enjoy the music"}
{"text":"Over an hour wait for table... over an hour wait for food... forgot one of the meals ordered... extremely dissatisfied with the lack of timely service and a disappearing waiter... manager had to visit multiple times to get refills, silverware, and sweetener."}
{"text":"Came here for a night out with my family. Atmosphere is great! Beautiful decorations, lively, and aromatics out of this world. Food flavorful and delicious. The portions are huge, we could not finish our food. Staff was friendly and informative, they would have have recieved five starts had it not be for their error in under charging my card and having to recharge my card which locked my card up. Bank though it was fraudulent being that I'm from Cali. So that was slightly irritating. Other than that, this will be one of my stops when im back in Arizona, but i will be hesitant to hand over my debit card...."}
{"text":"For what it is, it's one of the best, a Spaghetti and Pizza joint.

The food is always well prepared and tasty.  I especially like the thin crust pizza.  Everything I've had here has been very good, large portions and reasonably priced. 

The 5th star is for the attitude of the staff.  Everyone is always so damn happy, nice and helpful.  I've eaten at several of their locations and the story is always the same."}
{"text":"I've been to other Oregano's in the valley and have always enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. Sad to say I can't say the same about this one (located in Goodyear). Food and service were mediocre at best. This is really too bad- Goodyear needs lots of restaurants -  with good service and consistently good food."}
{"text":"Yesterday, we took my mom to Oregano's for a birthday lunch.  Not only was the food great, but our server, \"Sarah\", went above and beyond.  We eat out a lot and she was by far, one of the best and most attentive servers we have ever had. In fact, every worker we came in contact with was polite, professional and helpful.  I would like to give a shout out to Sarah for a great meal all the way around."}
{"text":"Brak love's Oregano's! I'm partial to the zany ziti, and sausage & peppers. Salads are awesome too. Crazy-huge portions, reasonable prices, good service. Just avoid the high-traffic times as the wait can be brutal."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza had the Clark street pizza. Some wings and the Caesar salad. Everything was great service was amazing even though it was busy. Don't let the reviews scare you"}
{"text":"Oh Oregano's, how shall I rate thee?

When my husband and I moved close by, we frequented this location. Or, at least tried to.

The parking is INSANE. This is no exaggeration. There is really, seriously no place to park. On several occasions we wanted to eat here and didn't because we had no place to leave the car. 

I was always very excited to eat here but disappointed once I was there. Everything I ordered was less than awesome. The Pablo Picasso salad was dry, with very little dressing, and way spicier than described in the menu. The Southwestern Shrimp salad is supposed to be on a \"bed of fried noddles.\" Sounds decadently delicious, right? It tasted like cooked and re-dried spaghetti. Literally inedible! The Big 'Ole Vedge sandwich sounds amazing but tastes totally bland, no flavor whatsoever. My husband has given the Italian Wedding soup a few different tries, but finds it is always way too salty. He gives their pasta the general description of \"bland\"; no matter which one he ordered, they all tasted the same. 

The only awesome food here is the pizookie cookie. A decadent, AMAZING dessert that, now that I think about it, I can easily make at home for half the cost and none of the hassle. 

Oh and the wait. An hour, minimum. No exceptions. You will always wait at Oregano's. My husband and I went so far as to CALL to put our names in, WALK to the restaurant, as parking is impossible, and we STILL had to wait nearly an hour! 

I keep wanting to give them another try, I'm not sure why, but my husband is having none of it."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had! No wonder the family who started Oreganos is from Chicago! Everything their pastas pizzas etc are amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for family-style Italian to round off our vacation on a hearty note, as drove by grazie, but it looked a little ambient for our four and two year old, if you know what I mean. 

So we stumbled upon Oregano's and what a  great find it was. The boom dip (I don't like that name), the Caesar, and the sproccoli thin crust pizza were notable. I want one of these in Orange County! They're expanding, but into Texas. Boo. 

My son had ordered a slice of kid's pepperoni and our server offered to bring him more and made his freaking day. 

And the pizza cookie is about ten times better than a BJ's pizookie (if that's even possible)!"}
{"text":"Been there twice. The first time I was alone so I opted to sit at the bar. Bar tender was excellent. He was pretty busy but attentive. He kept my drinks full and was helpful when ordering. I got the sausage sandwich and it was delicious. Recommend it if you like that sort of thing. 
Second visit was a Friday evening with my wife. Wait time was about 30 minutes, so not too bad. Our server wasn't the best. It took him a while to get to us and my drink was empty most of the time. He didn't know they offered Diet DP (I knew they did from my first visit). I finally had to walk to the bar to get my drink filled. Our food took a long time to get there. My wife ordered a pasta dish that we thought wasn't quite saucy enough so we asked for a bit more (which he charged us for). I got a pizza and it was amazing. We saw people who were sat after us that got their food before we did. 
So why 4 stars? We liked the food that much. We hate lowering the rating that much for one incompetent server. Next time we will sit at the bar. Almost forgot, portion sizes are quite big. Especially the salads. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went with the family during dinner time... (yes, I know full well they had a 35-45 min wait).  Here is where I get pissed... as I have children one needed to go the the restroom during this wait...  we go in and I see multiple tables throughout the restaurant that are empty (they don't do reservations I thought).  I go back out side and proceed to wait another 50 minutes for a table... yep over an hour wait with people standing outside and open (cleaned/bussed tables) inside.  The only thing I can think for this is they are trying to drive the hype of the restaurant by showing how many people a willing to wait outside.  The food was ok.  Not great but ok (don't believe the hype about \"home cooked\". It's not ) typical frozen chain meals.  Service was also ok.  Our server tried to make small talk conversation.  
TL;DR
It is ok if there is no line, but certainly NOT worth any exceptional wait"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, if I were a local it would most likely be a staple for me. Unfortunately we went 1.5 hrs before our flight home and somehow they managed to served everyone else but us. We had to get our food to go and rush to the airport, with 10mins to spare and eat our food out of styrofoam containers. I must admit that the meatball was pretty damn good, although I was really hungry and getting hankry at that point anything would have prbly tasted good .. Either way, I liked it."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's...90% of the time. But last night at this location I was soured. I ended up with food poisoning this morning. I won't go into details about the level of poisoning to save all who read this. 

I called the store this morning and spoke to a rude little manager named Natalie. I didn't want my money back or anything at all. When I told her what was going on two things happened that made me furious.

1. \"well, no one else has reported being sick so maybe it's just a bug you caught.\"
2. \"What do you want me to do about it? It's not like I can really do anything.\" She even went so far as to say that ALL good born illness takes at least 24 hours to come up. Really?! Do you have a food handler's card?!?! It doesn't take that long in most cases. At minimum she should have to take that test again! 

I used to work at the Scottsdale and Shea store. No manager who wanted to keep their job would ever be so snarky with a guest! And they would never try to blame said customer and blow them off. 

I simply tried to let them know and she was basically a word I can't  say here! 

I won't go back here. I was taught to take care of the guest. maybe she needs some lessons....

Emailed who I was told to email and I called
Corporate...No response."}
{"text":"Great service!  Food was hot and delicious.  
Would recommend the house  nacho chips as a table appetizer.  It's pretty big!"}
{"text":"It's our families go to restaurant when we visit Mesa. Love the thin crust pizza, the portions are really big but somehow they keep their prices very reasonable. Expect a little wait but the food usually arrives as expected"}
{"text":"it's next to my moms house...we always make one stop for pizza and pasta. Huge portions, nice service. I had the potato pizza with rosemary...it was good but I would not want more than a slice or two. My wifes pasta was great...and the baked cookie dessert was a huge hit and large enough to share."}
{"text":"Wait time is usually long here since it's the only one on the west side..but so worth it!! Calamari is delicious..not to mention the drinks too..gellini bellini you only need 1 bc it's deliciously strong. Good price for pizza and pastas are shareable!! Definitely love oreganos..legalize marinara!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We had wings, salad and calamari. Very very good. The service was also great. GREAT FOOD AND GREAT SERVICE= 5 STARS. We live in the west side and would drive to come to this place!!! The waiters Michael and Keith was were excellent!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service with good dependable food, we arrived late but they were very accomodating and our order was placed right away.  We love the Pesto Bruschetta, thanks for putting that back on the menu, it had gone away for awhile...we also love the Alfredo the Dark Pasta and the Pizza Cookie for dessert - DON'T MISS THAT.
Good service, great food, and the staff goes above and beyond.  What more could you want?  We love this place.
The only thing we would change is the VOLUME on the music - IT'S WAY TOO LOUD."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch today!! Young male server took care of us!! Forgot his name but great service!!!"}
{"text":"The salads are huge and delicious.  I go to two different Oregano's, the waitstaff is always nice at both places. I honestly can't say more since I never order anything but salads.  Try one, you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"This food was delicious and the ambiance was comforting. We went to celebrate a birthday and we were accommodated with a friendly smile and a free pazooki. However, the best part by far was the service. The service was exceptional and all the employees we encountered were kind and courteous. An especially outstanding member was a man named Bobby Murphy. What he lacked in height and age, he made up for with witty humor, kind assistance, and a smile that makes me want to live a better life."}
{"text":"Food - 5 stars (I had the Pablo Picasso Mexican Salad, btw, what is that name about? Pablo Picaasso is from SPAIN, in Europe).

Service - 2 stars. Our waiter was VERY nice, but not good. When the second waiter came over and said, \"Sorry for the delay. We did NOT lose your order,\" I was fairly certain that they had lost our order.

- Tables around us came, got their food, and left before we got our food, mostly ordering pizzas while the majority of our table had salads.
- I had to ask multiple times for a side of salad dressing.
- The waiter asked if we wanted boxes while we were still eating. We said yes, assuming he would bring boxes, but he instead took our plates mid meal. I had to take mine out of his hand and tell him I was still eating.
- A friend had to ask multiple times for a refill on tea.

I would probably go back, but I would make sure we have a different waiter next time!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time, my mix drink was good. The food is awesome, I got a Mexican pizza that is to die for. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've never posted before but need to comment on out experience. My wife and I worked in the restaurant business during college, So I understand that things happen. However, a 55 minute ticket time is too much for me. Service was good, but at the 40 minute mark when a member of management finally came to the table, the explanation was that there was a mix up. She offered to pay for our dinner, which was to be expected, but offers to have us come back were not made. Very disappointed. I will not be back."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout of the Greek salad.  You know I can make a salad but not as good as this one.  Some bread would have been nice. Chicken that comes with it was very good.  Missed out we didn't order the Pisooky which is  so awesome. No pizza either but the thing kind is just OK.  Healthy dinner from  Oreganos. Thanks."}
{"text":"A-MA-ZING! The Pablo Picasso salad is so flippin good. I can still taste it even as I write this a day later. Oreganos has so many delicious options to choose from that is makes it super difficult for me to decide on just one dish. I was there with a large group and we ordered an array of foods. The rosemary chicken potato pizza, the veggie wedgie, the boom dip, the pizzooki....all equals amazingness. The kids menu has several options and the portions are huge. We really enjoyed our experience there and we highly recommend it. Legalize marinara, lol!"}
{"text":"Another great meal at Oreganos. The Pablo Picasso salad is unstopable!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here. The WORST experience ever. Our 20 minute wait was close to an hour. No apology and definitely no better service. Even the food came out cold and stale/hard/coldish. What used to be out favorite place has gone to shit.  Avoid this location."}
{"text":"How any Oregano's location has only 3.5 stars is beyond me. We have NEVER had a bad experience at an oregano's. The food is always delicious and the portions are huge! The service is always very friendly and on the ball. They have great specialty drinks and a small but good selection of beer in draft. Some of the food can take a while to cook, but the server has always warned us if we ordered one of these dishes.

You won't be disappointed with what you order at Oregano's. I tend to favor the diablo shrimp pasta and any of the pizzas. Seriously, any of them. 

Save room for the pizza cookie! it truly is the best one out of all the other fakes that try and make it."}
{"text":"I understand new popular restaurants will have long wait times. To counter this, I'll go during off peak times or for lunch.  That being said, my office decided to check this place out for lunch. We arrived right at 11am and were the 6th group there. We had to wait 40 minutes just to be seated. They obviously aren't prepared to be open yet."}
{"text":"We were just traveling through and found this on yelp & pizza was delicious! Real cheese makes such a difference! Thank you for the spirit of excellence."}
{"text":"I asked our hotel who had the best Italian food in Tempe - they told me Oreganos.  I immediately followed with researching Yelp reviews.  I was a little uneasy about some of the more recent reviews I had seen so I called the restaurant to inquire.  I spoke with Ashley who just happened to be the GM.  Ashley gave me the perfect answer - they DO take Yelp reviews very seriously and actively train their employees based on what they find out on Yelp.  I decided to take my son and my best friend to try it out.  We arrived to see a significant amount of people waiting outside to be seated. After a short conversation, we parked and put our name in.  The hostess quoted us about 45 minutes.  During our wait, we were pleasantly surprised to see a plate of pizza brought out to satisfy those hungry souls that decided to wait. Waiting with some pizza in your hand is much easier than waiting with NADA.  Good Idea!!!
Once we were seated, we went through the menu and had a tough time deciding on what to eat.  They have so many enticing choices.  Since we had the pizza prior to being sat, we knew that was EPIC.  We went with the Julius Caesar Salad and 2 pizzas - one cheese and one BBQ chicken.  The salad came out first.  What would Julius Caesar have said if his life was not cut short that fateful day in March?  He would have said....yeeeaaaahhhh booooooyyyyyyyy - this salad ROCKS. Next was the PIE.  Oh man -  thin crust, right amount of topping, good amount of cheese, perfectly cooked - this was a good pie! 
Overall, we had an amazing experience at Oreganos.  The food, the staff, the atmosphere, all top-notch.  Ashleys experience and personality also resonated with us - she seemed to always be looking out for the guests and was VERY personable (not to mention, easy on the eyes, too). 
If you are in Tempe and want some delicious Italian food - this is the PLACE.  And, you get a fortune cookie afterwards....pretty cool.
Say HI to Ashley, too - you will know what I mean:)"}
{"text":"Don't tell anyone back East that I had a Chicago-style pizza last night!  I'll lose a pinky or end up buried in the Meadowlands.
What I like about Oregano's is the freshness.  We ordered the deep-dish, Chicago-style pizza and they warned us that it would take 45 minutes.  Hey, fine with me.  So, to bide the time, we got cheesy bread.  This thing was about 2 feet long!  It came out in a bread basket, but was hanging over the ends.  That's how long it was.  Hey, I'm single.  I pay attention to length.
There are a million different ingredients you can put on your pizza.  We had mushrooms (you can choose regular or portabella), onions (white, carmelized or red), green peppers and jalapenos.  It came out loaded with cheese and topped with sauce.  I like that.  It made the veggies and cheese all melted together and then topped with sauce.  I could only have one piece.  
I didn't stay for the pazookie.  One of these days, I will.  
The service was excellent.  We had a table outside (it had stopped raining) near the heaters.  The manager even gave me a blankie to put on my lap."}
{"text":"A man came over to my house last night with a bag of food.  Luckily, I knew he was coming.  OK, it was a \"dinner and a movie\" date and he brought a huge bag from Oregano's.  
As I started to get out plates and silverware, he mentioned that paper plates, plastic utensils and napkins were in the bag.  Well, he sprung for dinner, I can clean a few plates, right?  
HUGE portions!  He brought spaghetti with marinara.  It was angel hair.  I think there *could* have been more sauce.  
The lasagna was their \"Italian Flag\" lasagna and really good!  Ooey-gooey with sausage and meatballs stuffed inside.  The portion was enormous as well.  We both had a hunk and I had another one today for lunch.  
Both entrees had different kinds of garlic bread included in the container.  
The appetizer was something I'd never had before: Toasted Ravioli.  WTF???  Handmade ravioli, stuffed and fried with a side of marinara sauce to dip them in.  There was definitely some kick to it, as they were stuffed with cheese and jalapenos.
It was a very satisfying meal and I'm giving it three stars.  The portions were big, the prices were reasonable (looking at the website since he brought it to my place) and everything was full of flavor.    
This was no Harley's meal, but for something quick and Italian, it wasn't half bad!  Of course, eating a meal on the couch with a cute guy will always be a plus!"}
{"text":"People complain about the wait, but a half hour, to me, isn't much of a wait.
One thing I love about Oregano's is that they will make substitutions.  They have an awesome pasta dish with olives and sun-dried tomatoes.  It comes with feta, but I always have them substitute goat cheese.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm yumy!
I have no idea what a \"Pazookie\" is!
The outdoor patio in back is cute to eat at, too.  I love going to Oregano's with my whole family"}
{"text":"Good service. My macaroni and cheese sucked, the calamari sucked, the kids mac and cheese sucked but the salad was pretty good. Maybe I should have gotten pizza instead."}
{"text":"We're visiting from Los Angeles and were looking for a good place to eat so we came here and let me tell you that From beginning to end this experience was absolutely PERFECT!
The food was great and the service was flawless, our waitress \"Kelsey\" was very nice and knowledgeable.  My son says this has to be the best Pizza on earth!!!!
Great job.....we'll be back!
The Hernandez family from Los Angeles!
***GO DODGERS*** :-)"}
{"text":"Sooo Im a big pizza lover, and oreganos always has good pizza, but the service is horrid. I wont name names (mainly because she didnt give it to us), but the server was entirely unattentive, rude, and couldnt course a meal to save her life. Myself and  five others were seated for dinner on the patio. We waited roughly 15 minutes before our server decided to greet us. we placed our entire order drinks, apps, entree at once, not wanting to wait another 15 minutes to order. well the drinks took 15 minutes to get to the table anyway. Dinner came roughly a half hour later, all at once. No apps first or anything. I myself work in the business and know its really not that hard to course a meal. Anyway i was really disappointed as bad service can ruin a meal, and i was looking forward to this dinner. To be honest the food wasnt even that great. guess ive been having better pizza recently, as ive been sticking to the Family owned restaurants... If you want the combined Ambience,food, and service, try Brugos in Cave Creek, They're great!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great! 
 
Very laid back casual atmosphere, prompt service, clean bathrooms and friendly faces.

Started off with a Bloody Mary(comes with a pickle in it), Ordered the calamari and wings. I recommend the medium gold sauce! It's the medium spicy sauce with the gold sweet and spicy sauce mixed together! Absolutely the perfect mix. I've heard that you can also toss the calamari in the same sauce and it's absolutely divine!!! 

Can't talk enough about the amazing staff, super understanding and everyone makes sure your doing ok! 

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were regulars here.  I hate to give less than positive reviews but I need to share our experience.  Keep in mind I travel for business, so I always tip more than 20% and expect a little respect if I frequent your establishment.  We are always polite and friendly because we were raised that way; but heed my notes below: 

Pros: Food was always very good.  Unique items on menu. 
Cons: service is hit/miss and sometimes rude to downright disrespectful.  It's not the customer's fault or problem that you work as a waiter/waitress. 

Advice: Do not form relationships with any of the staff, because they began to take us for granted and started talking down to us, which I did not stand for.  

After about 8 months I went back tonight to see if things had improved, and to my disappointment they had not..."}
{"text":"Every time Im in Arizona its a requirement to have dinner hear at least one night! Cant get enough of this place!

Pablo Picasso salad is to die for!
The cheese bread... amazing!
Alfredo the Dark is my all time favorite!"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service, all I can say.  I went there yesterday for the first time.  Some overly confident little guy with blond spikey hair was in charge of taking reservations.   He said it was an hour wait -or- we could go sit anywhere in the bar where it is first come first serve open seating.  So we go and sit at the bar, get menus, are about to order.  Then a table opens up in the bar room.  We leave our seats at the bar, go to the table, and some other people take or seats at the bar.  A few minutes later spikey haired little guy comes over and says why are you sitting here?  I was taken by surprise and said you told us it was open seating.  He cut me off, raised his voice, told me I was a liar, then asked if my friends and I Iike to eat at dirty tables (they had not yet been cleared).  I said of course not, tried to explain, and he left in a huff after making a scene.  We were planning at that point on finishing our drinks, leaving the table, then just waiting the hour for a table.  Then, a waitress comes over two minutes later, looks at us, and says loud and as rude as she could:  are you going to get up or what?  I have NEVER been treated so rudely ANYWHERE.  We just left.  Who cares about the food, the servers/ spikey haired hostess are rude, will never go again."}
{"text":"LOVE the Pablo Picasso Salad!! It's got just the right amount of spice. My husband and I routinely go and split the salad - plenty big for two of us. Service is always great!"}
{"text":"After 3 years here in AZ, I finally went to Oregano's.  We had family in from OC and they were in the mood for Italian.

We had 3 boys-under age 9 with us and great-grandparents in their upper 80's.  There were food allergies, various needs and everyone was hungry!  Our group of 12 was wonderfully taken care of by a young man who was very vigilant about my dairy allergy, considerate about my mom's various dietary restrictions and made even our 2-yr old grandson very happy with a kid's pizza slice.  The food took a while to get to us, but that was okay-there were old movies playing on the TV (boys had never seen black and white!) and outside of that little glitch we were very happy.

Food was quite good and the portions were huge!"}
{"text":"Oregano's is one of our favorite restaurants. The food is always top notch and the service is usually great too. For starters, their wings are some of the best in the valley and if you like guacamole, you'll love their Guacatony. If you get a salad you have to try the Pablo Picasso, but all of them are delicious. We usually get the Alfredo the Dark with chicken when we order pasta, but you can't go wrong with any of their pastas. I'm not a big fan of thin crust pizza, but theirs is tasty. We used to love the Pizza Cookie for dessert, but they haven't been as good since they switched to aluminum pans instead of the traditional cast iron. The cookie just doesn't bake the same in the aluminum."}
{"text":"Love the food here, and great service. Often a wait time of 20-30 min but that is for a good reason. Everyone else loves the food too !"}
{"text":"Yelp... shame on you....All Denveriets...if you love Pizza and great crust, thin or thick...DO NOT ENTER these doors. It is not hand tossed, even when waiter told me it was and looked at me as if I had leprosy....could see the markings that I believe, one of the crust companies send you frozen.... manager came over and honestly said\" So you have a problem with our pizza\"? Dining alone . I said oh, no thank you and can I get the check.........as a food writer..if this is the best Scottsdale can do .... and it is 120 degrees outside, I say pass."}
{"text":"Why four out of five?  Because of all the waiting!  Other than that, I can't say enough about this place!  It's wonderful!  Everything I've eaten has been good not only the first time, but as a leftover as well.  Mmm!  The garlic bread with cheese makes for a great appetizer, and I confess I've also ordered it as my entre at least twice now.  Always get that homemade, meatless marinara too!  The salads are huge and delicious!  The pizza is thin and very West Coast, but it's alright.  I love the pasta dishes.  Also the Veggie Wedgie is a delightful vegetarian sandwich, truly unique and tasty.  The giant cookie dessert is worth it, if you make it to dessert and have someone to share it with.  The wine, beer, and cocktails available are also very nice and affordable at about $5 each.  They even sell shirts there for a reasonable price, if you're a huge fan like me!  There are many things on the menu that I haven't tried, I admit.  Some of that is due to the large amounts of meat in most dishes.  Otherwise, it's simply because I'm too hungry to wait for the 30-40 minute wait times many menu items incur.  I bring my out-of-town guests here when they're craving Italian.  This particular location seems busier than most, but you can't beat it.  And their slogans are right; garlic breath is sexy."}
{"text":"Seriously, I just clicked on \"two stars\" and the description couldn't have said it better. \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" I came here with my girlfriend at 8 on a Sunday night, and had a downright unpleasant experience. To sum it up; we waited for 45 mins, and then when I was seated I was told the deep dish would be an HOUR wait. WTF? I ordered the thin crust (which I hate) and got out of there in just under 2 hours. On the way out, I mentioned to the manager that they should really get thier act in gear and he told me, and I am quoting: \"The good news is we are opening up many locations all over the valley to cut down on your wait time and better accommodate.\" Really? I'm going to Grimaldi's. Next time I want shitty fake Italian food I'll go to Olive Garden..."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites EVER. Come here all the time. Awesome, friendly service always. 

My favorites to eat are: Alfredo the Dark, Sweet potato fries (w/ the aioli, it's BOMB), boom dip, big-rig pasta, pesto penne, and their garlic bread. OH and OF COURSE the white chocolate chip macadamia nut pizza cookies are a must. Seriously. You can't come here and not try one."}
{"text":"POOR SERVICE! Crystal, our server seemed to be more interested in talking with some guy in the corner booth than her guests. We had to ask her 3 times for some lemon wedges for my wife's water, which she asked for when we placed our drink orders. My pasta was ok, but my wife's gluten free pizza was mediocre at best. Waiting to get our check and Crystal is talking with boyfriend in corner booth. Finally I get the check with nothing more than a \" here you go\" from her and she hurries back to the corner booth. We felt like we were a bother to her. Well we won't be bothering you again."}
{"text":"Don't try to come here with more than 6 people. They won't let you call ahead unless you have 6 or less people. At least Bucca let's you make a reservation. The pizza is pretty good though."}
{"text":"This was my first time to an Oregano's and I will definitely be back with the family. The atmosphere is casual fun with an old world feel. Especially if you sit outside (weather permitting). The lunch specials are great. I tried the O'Zone (calzone) of the day the \"especial.\" Needless to say I had no leftovers. My dining companions got several other dishes that looked very impressive. The salad is definitely no joke. It was so big one person could only eat 1/3rd of hers. We also had a birthday at the table and the pizza cookie (peanut butter chocolate chip cookie) was amazing! I would highly recommend Oregano's."}
{"text":"Horrible service we waiting for an hour to be served our food even talked to manager and he didn't seem to care about it just brushed it off"}
{"text":"Nothing special , the food wasn't bad but wasn't great. Took a long time to come out of the kitchen . Very loud . Not a place I'd be likely to tryurn"}
{"text":"Love this place and the service. I haven't had anything I didn't like. My favorite...Picasso salad"}

{"text":"Food Portions are generous.  They feed you like an Italian family that never wants you to leave their house. Be ready to eat when you come here...with a cool 50s styling and really friendly atmosphere it lives up to the billing of a neighborhood joint.

Having come here more than a handful of times we have ordered pizza after pizza which is a solid choice.  This time we wanted to try to the pasta.

We ordered the Pesto Penne Bake and it is put in a bread bowl...delicious on so many levels we still couldn't finish it.  The pesto, mozzarella cheese and sundried tomatoes make for such a great meal."}
{"text":"My first time the food was great the hot wings omg hot! hot!  I think it the best restaurant in the Paradise Valley mall area by far.  though the prices were $$$$$ but omg the portions were extremely large so if you want good food and good service check this place out"}
{"text":"Had lunch with clients and friends here yesterday....been to all of the other Oreganos but this one did not live up to the sister properties...are they franchised?  Anyways, there were 4 of us, and 2 of us ordered the Oregano's favorite with chicken(salad)...neither of the salads came with chicken (and this was after he confirmed the order with us twice BEFORE putting the order in?...waiter was nice, but checked in with us at least 4 times before we got the order and then stopped by at least another 6 times.  When it came time to refill the drinks (3 teas were the same and one was a coke) instead of bringing a pitcher to refill everyone's glass, he told me they don't have pitchers and he took the glasses away to get refilled (not new ones).  We were all wondering how we would get the same glass back and of course we didn't.  The only way I knew mine was the same was because of the lipstick on the straw.  I considered this very unsanitary and think the manager needs to look into this.  We arrived at 11:20, food delivery was slow for Oregano's standards and I would not be interested in coming back here."}
{"text":"We had a party of 8. We were quoted 1 hour 45 minutes but it only ended up being 40 minutes. Meanwhile, we received samples while waiting. The pizza was incredible as always. They have Hatch Green Chile which was a wonderful add-on to our pie. The service was excellent.

I did notice quite a few empty tables and continual lines of people outside. Perhaps the staffing isn't quite calibrated with the demand. It's a new location and they will work the kinks out. A very great addition to this area."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Oregano's since the 1st location in Tempe opened up.  It's absolutely our favorite place.
The dough they give our kids to play with is a fun different change from other places.

The Boom Dip is fantastic!
Pasta Basta is my favorite.

We love the idea of a smallish restaurant with great patios.  The wait is an issue most of the time but what does that tell you?  There wouldn't be a wait if it wasn't any good.

We have now traveled to almost all the locations just for fun!
The ambiance is great at all we've been to.

We have out of town guests who always request a trip to Oregano's.

Here's a tip...there's a couple dishes that take 30-45 min. so order those while your waiting and it'll be ready once you get seated."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out with my parents while they were in town. 1 hour wait to get to the table and 45-50 mins to get out food. I basically ordered a turkey sandwich with cold cut turkey slices, my sister had a salad mom spaghetti dad meatball sandwich and girlfriend lasagna. 50 mins to cook pasta ? The server was so slow taking 10 mins in between times to check on us. Food was average nothing great !!!"}
{"text":"I got take out pizza. $40 for 2 pizzas (seems a little pricey, but I was still game) Both were burnt. I called and manager took cost of one of the pies off my order. That was nice of them. But I just wasn't impressed there was a lot of hype about this place....and I'm just eh. Kudos to management for fixing the problem but don't know that I'll go back."}
{"text":"The service is very very slow. Not your typical oreganos experience. 30 min to  get a salad, 45 min wait for our thin crust pizza. Our long wait for our food was acknowledged by the wait staff or manager until we asked about our food. They made no apologies for the long wait, just an excuse of \"yea we had a big to-go order, that's why it's taking so long\". Great food but really unprofessional staff and management. Disappointed by this location."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the staff is very friendly.   I personally love the Roasted Garlic Chicken Lasagna.  It is a twist on your average lasagna, and it is so delicious!   We will continue to come back and tell everybody we know about the wonderful experience and great food we have each time we come."}
{"text":"Just had this today. Order some calamari tossed in wing sauce. So good they should just add it to the menu."}
{"text":"Oreganos will always be exactly what you want from it. The wait to be seated can sometimes be long, but the food will always be great and very well portioned. More importantly, your wallet won't be hurting when you leave.

Not a big fan of Chicago-style pizza in general, but I crave their waffle fries and sandwiches regularly."}
{"text":"I love this pizza place! I went a few days ago after wanting to for months after I'd had Lou Manatí's.and I'd have to say while I do like Lou's crust better, Oreganos utilizes more spices for a more flavorful pizza. I would definitely recomend! the prices are affordable the pizza is great and the service is exceptional! the deep dish pizza may seem small but it will fill up at 3 people if you get an app"}
{"text":"We eat at this Oregano's location At Least 3 times a month, usually lunch, but sometimes for dinner since it's the closest location to our home. We also have eaten at the Scottsdale & Shea,  and in Phx. on Cactus, Glendale, and even the New one in Flagstaff, so we know the menu well & how the food should be. 
We arrived at 11:50AM, and they were out of stuffed pizzas?!? which is a midday special. The restaurant was not very busy either. So we changed our orders. My tree hugger skillet of vegetables looked very small on arrival compared to the other 2 times I've had it. Turns out it was totally missing the broccoli & not topped with the shredded cheese either. So they took it away to add the missing ingredients while I ate my husband's side salad. I've noticed there is just NO consistency at this location!!!
In the past, my eggplant parm. was tiny while other times normal size & the pasta was cold to boot, my chicken Caesar salad once had crumbled pieces of chicken on top, like tiny scraps while other imes you can see it is chicken, and the Oregano's Favorite salad was so over dressed with very wilted lettuce, the big hot chicken parm. sandwich sometimes isn't big, like you got a half of one  --- I let these things go until today, when my skillet arrived is when I finally voiced My disappointment to our server.
I couldn't understand why it looked so skimpy. It didn't even fill the skillet to the edges. It was the manager who noticed it was missing items. We still tipped our server very well, she did apologize profusely, it was of no fault of hers, it was the kitchen who goofed up. The manager who was sent over was very nice. We had a lengthy chat. He did take care of this goof up, but by the time my corrected skillet was finally about to come out, we had to leave -- so it was packed to go. So my lunch today was an iced tea & my husband's side salad.  :(   No one should leave a Lunch Out hungry!"}
{"text":"Went back to Oregano's with a friend yesterday.  Service was outstanding as usual.  Upon leaving the restaurant, our server, Lindsay, could see I was moving at a snail's pace trying to carry my 11 week old baby in his carrier out to my car.  You see, my baby and I were rear-ended a few weeks ago and I have a sprained/strained cervical and lumbar spine respectively along with a sprained knee, and was truthfully having great difficulty.  She offered to carry my baby in his carrier all the way out to my car for me.  I felt kind of guilty accepting her offer, but upon her insistence I did.  She even lifted him into the back seat of the car for me.  This is just another example of the kind of people you have on your extremely caring staff!!  Thank you SO MUCH!!!"}
{"text":"SULLIVAN IS A BADASS!!!!


The absolute best service.

He already knows my order, he gets us in & out quickly, with to go drinks & boxes . I'm always back to work with time to spare.

If you ever stop by, sit at the bar and ask for Sullivan aka Sullivan the badass!"}
{"text":"This by far my best experience ever!!! The staff is amazing and Cynthia Ogaz needs a raise she is Awesome!!! Greatest waitress ever and really Beautiful!!!! Great service and The manager Monica is the best!!! We coming back"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!  If you like thin crust and authentic style Italian, this is your place."}
{"text":"We love Oregano's and the one on Germann and Dobson lives up to their high standards. If you've never been to Oregano's try their wings of fire. Sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience at Oregano's but our last visit was super awesome due to our waiter. I wish I remembered his name! (Nice young guy that reminded me of David Archuleta) He asked just the right questions to help us with our order which I really appreciated! Because of this, my husband and I got exactly what we wanted. 

Just a little tip on the Pizza Cookie- it's best when served \"medium\". Sometimes it comes to us way too raw. We like it lightly cooked but still have that very soft center when you dig in. ;)"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Cold beer! Great menu!  The pizza 's are huge! The selection of sandwiches are great. The chicken parmigiana sandwich is what I'm going to be trying tonight. If you get here early there's no wait. But if come after 6. Forgettaboutit. A any how just got sandwich   Excellent. Made me change from 4 to 5 stars. Fries , not so good. But sandwich is awesome Bon appetite"}
{"text":"I am leaving two stars because of the lack of customer service, and the sheer folly that a pasta order Togo taking an hour and 15 minutes...(it's freaking pasta) I was told pizza would be 1.5 hours which for thin crust is crazy as well. Granted I know they were busy but I called 3 other oreganos locations whom also had a very long wait for pizza each was an hour or more. Ok then that makes sense however ALL 3 of the other locations told me 15-25 minutes for pasta max. And they had a 45 min to hour wait. Clearly this place has either incompetent employees or they are severely understaffed which speaks to the ineptitude of management. Seriously oreganos typically is awesome but the 3-4 trips to this location has been an utter disappointment. I hope the owners see this and do something about it because something is wrong at this location.  Get it together. (Or only go at lunch around open because that's the only time I have had a good experience at this location. 

Staff-friendly and polite
Good- good but takes way longer than ANY location I have ever been to. (Pizza both times under cooked seriously you undercook thin crust?)
Price- not worth the wait
To go orders- apparently if you want dinner at a decent hour you need to call hours in advance

I love oreganos but hate this location they have let this business down in my opinion"}
{"text":"Nice menu selections besides pizza.  I am thoroughly a fan of their beef sandwich.  Not quite a true Chicago Italian beef but very good.  The beef itself is super tender and tasty. The sweet potato fries are some of the best I've had.

Warning:  portions here are GIANORMOUS.  I ordered the jr. size beef and it was still too much food.

Awesome outdoor eating area!"}
{"text":"So I just visited oreganos a couple of days ago. I always get the Pablo Picasso salad, amazing. Unfortunately, I was disappointed this time. I ordered coleslaw and they changed the recipe. The old kind was made with wasabi mayo and green olives, and I loved it! Now, it's just blah. The cole slaw won't keep me from going back, but just miss the old stuff. Could I get the recipe?! Thanks! :-)"}
{"text":"I love the pizza cookie.  Such a simple concept, but so delicious!  As I scarfed one down this past weekend I told my dining companion \"I think this may be my favorite dessert ever.\"

The rest of the food is good, I've never ordered anything here that I didn't like.  It only gets 4 stars instead of 5 because I always feel like it's a little bit dirty - maybe because so many families come here and the kids make a mess on the floor."}
{"text":"I went into the Tempe location last night and had a great experience. The server was awesome he was funny timely and engaging. The food was good not great but good...the atmosphere the service and the value more then made up for it though. I will be going again!"}
{"text":"My friend David and I arrived at Oregano's around noon on a weekday. I was hoping there would be outdoor seating, as natural light is so much better than fluorescent lights for food photography! Luckily, there were open tables on the back patio, so we were showed immediately to a table protected from the sun by an umbrella. David was quite surprised by the fact that we didn't have to wait. In the past, he'd waited for anywhere from 45 minutes to over an hour to get a table. Oregano's is notoriously busy--and w/notoriously slow service.

Aside from being HUGE, the menu is packed full of dishes. Surprisingly, there are no mozzarella sticks listed under the appetizers. Instead, pick from items like stuffed mushrooms and Italian guacamole, each averaging around $5-6. We passed on the appetizers, going right for the heartier stuff.

David suggested we have pizza, as he'd had it in the past and really enjoyed it. We considered getting a whole pie, which is available in thin, pan, or deep-dish crusts. Specialty pizzas at Oregano's are particular inventive. Take the 'Frisco, for example (\"A tomato cream sauce covers this baby, topped with spiced feta cheese, bacon, diced roma tomatoes and cheddar cheese\"), or Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato (\"This family favorite is made with our red pepper pesto, Grandma's special roasted garlic chicken, diced roma tomatoes, gorgonzola, sliced potatoes, havarti, our four cheese blend, caramelized onions and fresh rosemary\"). 

David also ordered a small dinner salad ($2.99) for us to share. Our waiter explained that the salad would take longer than the pizza (huh?), so he said he'd have things timed so that the salad and the pizza would arrive at the same time.

After we put in our orders, I watched as other tables were served their food. A number of other diners ordered salads, each of which appeared to contain a serving of greens more suited for a giraffe.

Fewer tables ordered pastas, but a couple options there looked pretty good. I'm not such a ricotta fan, but if I were, I'd be ordering the Big 'Ol Ravioli for $9.29: \"A large 6\" ravioli (1/4 lb) stuffed with ricotta and other Italian cheeses, slathered with our meat sauce, then baked with cheese on top.\" Just thinking about it makes me want to play Frisbee...

If you're not hungry enough for a flying disk of stuffed pasta, go for some layers instead. Four different lasagnas, all priced at $9.29, seem like a good options for those who are willing to wait 30-45 minutes for a special dish. The chicken lasagna piques my interest, while the artichoke version combines an unusual ingredient in a very traditional dish. I wouldn't expect that sort of risk at a chain restaurant in Phoenix, of all places, but it's good to know that such options are available.

In addition to the pizzas and pastas, Oregano's covers another base w/sandwiches. The sandwiches seem pretty typical of what you'd find at your local college pizzeria: meatball and Italian subs. In terms of quality, though, these sandwiches appear to be a step or two above University Pizza and Wings, the likes of which deliver to drunk coeds until 3 a.m. Oregano's subs are served on 10\" rolls or focaccia. 

By the time I'd finished daydreaming and people watching--half an hour later--our food had arrived. The small salad was really anything but. The two of us still had leftovers, so the small salad would probably be a good side for three or so people. The fresh mixed greens contained nary a brown leaf. Topped w/tomatoes, red onion rings, and a surprisingly large portion of crumbled gorgonzola, the salad is a different take on the ho-hum house salad. 

I didn't fill up too much on salad, as I had pizza sitting in front of me. Each pizza turned out to be a quarter of a full pie, and each massive slice was served on a large, circular pizza tray. No matter how you eat the pizza, it's pretty darn good: the crust is very thin, but it's not crackery, and the bottom has a tad less char than I prefer; the cheese is mild, chewy, and a tad stringy; the toppings are fresh and plentiful. The amount of sauce may have been a tad much, and I also found it too sweet.

If the marinara sauce doesn't satisfy your sweet tooth, the one dessert at Oregano's will. The pizza cookie is a half-pound cookie topped with three scoops of vanilla ice cream. For $4.99, this dessert is easily enough for four people.

While Oregano's food is above average, the food is not worth the epic waits so common for a table at the restaurant. In a rush, Oregano's is the last place I'd want to eat. But on a leisurely night, when I don't mind waiting too long for a table or for my meal, I'll head back to Oregano's for its friendly service, reasonable prices, and above-average food."}
{"text":"One of my collegue have been raving about Oregano's Pizza and since I I'm in town, I wanted to check it out myself.  Can we say yum!!  Living in NYC for a while, I've became somewhat of a picky pizza eater, but Oregenos has nice spice and you can actually pick up the pizza and fold it.  The slices are HUGE, especially the lunch special, which by the way is only 2.99.  The greek favorite salad is a nice addition to the slice pizza.  It has a little bit of sweetness and pine nuts in the salad gives it a nice crunch.  

Server Brian was surburb!!  Spent a good 10 minute walking us through the choices.  Gotta also love their t-shirts, \"Legalize Marinera.\""}
{"text":"Great, awesome stuffed pizza.  Ordered to carry out, and they gave me a 1:15 wait time. Given that I wasn't super hungry, I decided it was worth the wait to try (had a bad pizza craving today).  Ordered it with sausage.  When I picked it up, I was surprised how heavy it was (ordered a medium). It was definitely the heaviest pizza I've ever carried.

Now on to the pizza.  I was surprised how much I liked it:  the tomato sauce was really good and it also had loads of cheese. The sausage was overpowered by the sauce, but it was good.  

Pomo is my favorite pizza place here, but, if you're in the mood for for a good 3000 calorie pizza that will feel like a load in your tummy, look no further.  This was well worth the calories!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Chicago style deep dish pizza. There was about 15 minute wait time on a Thursday evening. Once seated, we were served immediately. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. 
We decided on calamari appetizer. It was on the salty side and didn't have any tentacles, so I was little disappointed. We also ordered Brussel sprouts appetizer. It was seasoned perfectly, slightly over cooked, but loved the flavor.
The deep dish pan pizza took 35 minutes to bake, but definitely worth the wait. The crust was cooked perfectly, nice and crunchy. We ordered the 12 inch for 3 adults, but had plenty of leftovers. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this and all of their locations since they opened. The food is always fresh hot made to order and tastes very much like a homemade food. What's that this is a weird very helpful and friendly. All of the girls that work here are very pretty. Great place for chicago thin and stuffed crust pizzas."}
{"text":"In general I enjoy eating at  bistro, but every time I come to this location I leave disappointed in some way. This time service was very slow, our waiter couldn't wait to get to the next table, and the quality of the food was subpar. In the past it's been hair in food, poor service, and attitude from employees. The only reason I give 2 stars is for the pizza cookie which is really hard to screw up and quite delicious. Try Cafe Boa in mill, it's great."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Came here last night for my boyfriend's birthday and it was the quickest service we've had in awhile! Our server was absolutely amazing as well, and made our experience really fun and engaged with us the entire time. The manager (I believe) took over for the hostess and seated us without hesitation and made sure we were having a nice evening."}
{"text":"Uh oh!!  My favorite favorite favorite restaurant and two times in a row my Bollo Pasta has been a glob of sticky goopy glop.  One more strike and we might have a problem.  That said, their sauce is the best in town and their deep dish pizza untouchable."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food but don't come here hungry expecting quick service. I came here on a weekday evening with the place packed and service took the expected time, came here the next day early in the afternoon with the place almost empty and the service was slower than the night before. The thin crust pizza is great, awesome flavor and crust. Ingredients are fresh and perfectly cooked. Prices are fair and the amounts plentifully. It's really worth a try, just don't come in a rush."}
{"text":"I love Oregano's! Everything is big enough to share, they go above and beyond in service. The peanut butter dessert cookie is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few of the Oregano's locations, multiple times and they are very consistent in service and food quality.  I love the service! The wait staff is always really friendly, your drink is filled, and they almost always offer you a to go cup at the end. The food is delicious. The peanut butter cookie for dessert is always a must have.  I am in love with that cookie!  It is thin crispy crust pizza, which is not always my favorite but there are a ton of things on the menu to choose from and I've never had anything that I didn't like."}
{"text":"A good pizza is something the soul needs every now and then. We tried the Pesto Pizza and it was phenomenal! I'm not one for thin crust pizza but I was not disappointed with this one. The atmosphere was welcoming although it was loud-couldn't expect a private diner either though. The customer service was good and the waitresses were friendly for being so busy. The noise level was loud but besides that it was a great experience. The way they serve the pizza on the rack on the table was new and exciting to me! I would have loved to try other pizzas but one was enough for the two of us and we had to leave with no room for dessert."}
{"text":"Service suck, food is ok, Would I come back to this place? No There is better Italian restaurants in town which quality food and great service. I dont know why people go here and why they still in business."}
{"text":"I really dig this place.  I would give it five stars but the food is very good but never hits excellent.  Also my last trip there which was a few days ago, I had the pleasure of starring at some dudes ass crack who was sitting in front of me at the bar.  Not Oregano's fault.  But still there was some middle aged wanna be hipster with 1980's grunge greasy long hair. Anyway on to the food. 
Lately I have been ordering the Pablo Picasso Hispanic Orientated salad.  I have been dieting, a little on the \"fat\" side lately. Sometimes I get two bear claws wedged right in this spot.  After some research I found without the dressing and corn chips it is not to bad on the calorie intake.  Also the flavor really is excellent, the chicken is super well done.  It is fajita style but maybe better. 
Also note to one bartender stop charging me for soda water with a small amount of lemonade and I will tip much better.  
Oregano's I will see you soon."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time for lunch to get their mini deep dish pizzas that are limited in supply and you better get there early because they go quick...because they are sooo good and they can feed two people almost.  But went there with the family last night and  you know how it can be kinda difficult to satisfy 4 people with the same pizza?  So we often do half and half to make everybody happy...and we've never ran into this situation, they wanted to charge as if the whole pizza had all the toppings...meaning if you get 3 toppings on one side and 3 different toppings on the other side, you better be prepared to pay for a 6 topping pizza...about $8 extra.  So they are off the 'family friendly' list for me."}
{"text":"Service was great. I got the Alfredo and it was pretty bland even with the poblano pepper. My salad was decent. Portions are huge"}
{"text":"My take out order was missing items. Staff was inattentive. Management refused to help."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch with a girlfriend last Saturday on 7/27.  We had both been before but it had been years since we last frequented.  We were there around noon and it was still pretty dead.  We were seated right away, and quickly decided to splitsy the Jr Caesar salad and the meatball sub (is it me or can you tell who's a close friend if you can splitsy meals?!)  The JUNIOR salad was enormous, and we should have used our better judgement and got the Jr meatball as well...but our roaring stomachs got the better of us.  We each only got through half of our half, and left a lot of salad on the plate.  Food was good but not great - caesar is pretty generic and the meatball sub is as good as a meatball sub can be.  3 stars for consistency and large portions and reasonable prices - we got outta there with an $8 tab each."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Seated immediately; no wait for two people
- Appetizer came out fast
- the GuacaTony was pretty good
- Waiter was attentive about refilling our glasses

Cons:
- We walked in at 6pm and didn't get the main course until 650pm. 
- My boyfriend ordered a pizza Chicago style and got it regular. 
- The marinara sauce is LOADED with oregano. I mean, I get its the name of your establishment but calm it down. It's making the food unenjoyable because we CAN'T TASTE ANY OTHER FLAVORS
- When the waiter boxed our appetizer he used his hands
- The lettuce in the side salad was browned along the edges
- The Italian Meats stuffed \"calzone\" I got was sprinkle with small dices of pepperoni and packed full of five different cheeses. Which, I suppose is fine but I'd prefer to not eat a plate of just melted cheese.

Verdict: Won't be going back, probably won't be ordering food to go any more either. There are better places in the area worth your money than this."}
{"text":"Unacceptable, I ordered take out and waited 30 minutes to get two dishes that were \"mid day rush\" I never got a chance to eat it and these were simple orders. Midday rush did not happen. I had to drive back to work and get on the clock thanks for the lousy failed take out service and no lunch."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for 6 days and had Oregano's for dinner two of them.  That said, I really loved this joint!  

A friend has been going to Spring Training for a few years now and always comes home raving about Oregano's.  So when my husband and I were in Arizona last week, we had to give it a try.  

Here are my recommendations:
Alfredo in the Dark ----- sooo good!
Cheesy garlic bread
Baked Ziti
Baked Pesto with meatballs --- really awesome and I am not a huge meatball fan either. Everyone was stealing them from me.
Deep Dish pizza
Stuffed Mushrooms

The outdoor seating was great, but as I understand they are moving in a few weeks.  I am sure the next building will be even better.  I really want to remake Alfredo in the Dark at home.  I don't think I can wait until next year."}
{"text":"Such a pleasant place to visit. Decor very fun, digging on Sinatra and retro B/W tv. Loved our deep dish pepperoni pizza. A party of theee could not finish the 12 inch deep dish. Plenty to share later. The antipasto was the size of a football and packed with sliced Italian cold cuts. 
Very good service and waiter was polite and professional."}
{"text":"I've been going to this delicious renowned Gilbert pizza spot since I was a kid. They were here before all the development and served amazing pizza.. 

I'm not even sure where to start? If you're a deep dish fan, look no further. I couldn't even finish a slice of their mouth watering deep dish.. And even recently, my thin crust pepperoni didn't stand a chance against my friends and I.. 

The service is always great, the wait for food depends on how busy they are. 9/10 times they are fairly busy, but are well staffed. Be prepared to wait as they don't take reservations, so go have a good beer at their bar!

I always finish our pizza adventures off with one of their pazookis that are good for three+ people.

Hands don't a great atmosphere in downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I always love eating at Oreganos but this last time I went in was amazing. Denise was very friendly and so bubbly. She recommended menu items that I had not tired. She made my day with her happy mood and helpful service. I wish all servers were like her."}
{"text":"Do I seriously need to tell you how incredibly delicious Oregano's food is?! It's daydream material, people. I moved away from Phoenix almost ten years ago and I STILL think about this food. 

Granted, sometimes Oregano's can get packed - it is a popular place, after all - but I've almost always found it worth the wait. The ambience is really fun and kitschy, and the soundtrack they have playing really adds to the fun experience too. They offer a lot of different options for you, be it pizzas, pastas, salads, or sandwiches (I love just about anything with their Cajun chicken on it). Obviously you have to have a pizookie afterwards too (if you have to ask, just order one and find out what heaven tastes like). 

If I seem a little fanatic, so be it - this place is an all time favorite for many locals, myself included! If you're still wondering if you should check it out or not, just go - and could you bring me back a half peanut butter half chocolate chip pizookie while you're at it? :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the only places I crave every single day. From the salads to the wings, it's all delicious. Plus great atmosphere and family friendly."}
{"text":"Ugh. Maybe I've outgrown chain restaurants. My lasagna was super salty & spicy, why?? My son's pizza was burned to a crisp - twice! This Place was packed on a Wednesday but nothing to rave about. So sad :("}
{"text":"A friend took me here while I was visiting and it was pretty amazing. It was a Saturday evening, we waited about 20 mins, so not too bad. At first we sat out on the outside patio because it was kind of full inside (obviously it was hot) and they brought out ice water to everyone out there, without being asked for it. Then we moved inside after it cleared up a bit and they brought around samples of pizza for everyone to try! We were sat and ordered the cheesy breadsticks with the guacamole on top, sooooo good. I wasn't sure about it at first but it was amazing. I ordered the Mediterranean pizza and it was really good, I subbed the red sauce for pesto though. I had their frozen Bellini too, very good."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants I have ever been too. Ordered the boom dip as appetizer and the mexican salad with the ziti for our entrees. The portions are very generous and prices very reasonable. Will definitely be back on my next trip out to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Oreganos location in the valley. The Oreganos favorite salad is always on point! Just wish they would bring back Coke Instead of Pepsi seeing as how their water tastes like crap. Definitely do yourself a favor and have the cheesy garlic bread with the marinara sauce too!"}
{"text":"This is some solid pizza - recommended by friends and family when we moved to AZ, they do a very solid thin crust pizza with very tasty toppings.  I prefer thinner crusts, so they get my stars!"}
{"text":"I had some really great deep dish pizza here! It was just beautiful! It was not as good as Lou Malnati's, but it was still excellent. However, my girlfriend however couldn't stand her shrimp pasta, it tasted and smelled WAY too much like the sea and she loves seafood."}
{"text":"This appears to be a very popular local restaurant. It was very busy on a Wednesday night. We were originally told it would be a 45 minute wait. It actually was about 30 minutes.BUT we were seated at a long picnic table with another couple at the other end. That wasn't really that bad, there was quite a bit of space between us, but then some obtuse guy plopped drink then his body at our table while he talked to his friends. Incredibly rude on his part. Our waiter saw him and said nothing. I mentioned it to him and he was like \"sorry\" but didn't offer to ask him to move. It ruined our dinner. We had pizza. They said it was \"Chicago style\". I'm from Illinois and I'm pretty sure the only thing \"Chicago style\" was old time Dominos. The toppings were pretty good but the crust was cracker style on the edges and a bit soggy in the center.
We didn't try the deep dish pizza, so it might have qualified as Chicago style."}
{"text":"Based on comments posted, when you order an appetizer and a pizza or entree, let the waitress know that once your appetizer is delivered, then the entree should be placed.  As far as service goes, it is a busy restaurant.  Go there with the attitude that you are not in any hurry, then all will fall into place.  If it does not work for you, arrive before 5 or after 7:30."}
{"text":"This is a regular for us, and unfortunately we're stuck in a rut and order the same thing just about every time now.  But every time we think of ordering something different we feel like we'll miss our old favorites.  The Pablo Picasso salad is simply fantastic, and I'm not really a salad person.  The Cheesy Garlic Bread makes my mouth water and the Pesto pizza with added chicken is wonderful.  Plus, it's kid-friendly, as our kids love playing with dough while waiting for our meal.  My only complaint is that the wait can be quite long.  Two days ago we were waiting for outdoor seating and despite there really not being anyone else by the front door, we still waited a good half hour.  Guess that's the nature of wanting a specific area with a decent size group (which is why no star is docked...we understand!)  We have been countless times and will continue to go, though will probably stay away on the normal busy nights."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but I sure will take the time to write this one...I'll tell you a little later how Oregano's always serves me the TASTIEST Salad ever (Pablo Picasso) my favorite by far!! but first, let me tell you about how I met the world's nicest server this evening. I've been eating at oregano's for 3 years now and it's one of favorite restaurants because of its great food and friendly servers but I've never met a more amazing server ....Jordan made my my restaurant experience 1000x better! I believe I have a very good judgment in character and I honestly don't remember the last time I met a more genuine and nice person/server that really truly loves his job in my life. And at the end he offered to buy me and my friend a very yummy dessert..(pizzuki) as a nice gesture above his amazing attitude. So for everyone who goes to that place..just make sure to ask for Jordan to be ur server and enjoy a great meal with \"genuinely\" nice service."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The boom dip was delicious. I would highly recommend it to anyone. The salads are quite large. There were four of us, and we each had plenty. The Pablo Picasso and Oregano's Original are my two favorites.  Every pizza we've ever ordered there  has been so tasty. The cookie desserts are amazing. Travis was our server this past visit and was very attentive. My only complaint is my daughter had a $25.00 gift certificate she received for Christmas and it had already expired and the manager wouldn't let us use it. It would have been nice if the manager would have been more accommodating and let us use it.  We didn't realize it had an expiration date because it was in fine print."}
{"text":"You know, it's oreganos. Always great food at reasonable prices. We had 7 of us tonight and were seated promptly. 4 of us showed up 1st and told our server we wanted deep dish so could she put in this Numero Uno right away. She said yes and left. Came right back and we all ordered boom dip, always delicious, the antipasto salad, 1st time I tried this and it was awesome. My niece ordered a meatball sandwich with waffle fries and it came out with chips. Nephew ordered pasta which he liked. We had to ask for plates, silverware, napkins and every time we needed a refill. Pretty bad service. Then....our pizza came. Thin crust. So disappointed but she knew what she did because she never came back to the table. We told the food runner it was wrong but we didn't have time to wait. He could care less, he just put it down and walked away. Next time we saw our server, she was dropping off the bill. No offer for dessert, nothing, just the bill."}
{"text":"Something is going on here. The last 2 times Ive been here, the food has gone so far downhill! Last month, we had a 6 top and our food all came out cold and we all sent 4 dishes back and had to ask for more sauce on 3 of them. Yesterday, the same thing. The wings were great, boom dip is always on point but the mac and cheese was bland and not creamy or cheesy at all. The alfredo after dark was virtually sauceless. Very buttery and bland as hell. The same with the bollo pasta. No sauce. Maybe they are \"practicing safe marinara \"....so disappointed because I frequently come here. One thing that never seems to change is superb service. Thank you to Gretchen! She was a complete sweetheart. Maybe I'll just stick to bellinis and boom dip..."}
{"text":"I'm hooked! Seriously best pizza ever! Since first coming here I've been going back for my \"cheat days\" almost every weekend! Love their thick crust pizza with sausage and red jalapeño. Their pastas are also all good. The drinks are great and the servers are all really nice. Only problem is the wait time for a thicker crust pizza is 40 minutes. But that's what garlic knots and appetizers are for, right? ;)"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place one star because my dinner salad was pretty good (italian dressing had big chunks of tomato in it, which was strange), and my chicken parm sandwich was somewhat ok... The thin crust pizza was below average- absolutely no seasoning- just beyond boring blah pizza. Not good. The service was ok... And I'm being nice.  This was our first and last time here. I have no idea what all the hype is about this place- not impressed."}
{"text":"I actually like the food... but they have such huge portions that eating an app and meal is out of the question. The music they played was really loud horrible jazz. (Most people don't like free-form jazz!!) I had to stuggle to others speak. The waitress was nice, smiley... but so over-eager that she started boxing up our take home food while my friend was still eating it! (Hand still on it!) It's been years since I ate at am Oregano's, but I remember it being better before!"}
{"text":"I cannot tell you what the draw is to this place but it certainly isn't worth waiting for a table here. The pizza was the worst pizza we ever had, anywhere! It was bland, tasteless but with an occasional funky flavor mixed in. Very expensive pizza when you consider the poor quality ingredients it is made with. I can't complain about the service but they weren't overly busy when we were there. This was our first time going there and we will never go back."}
{"text":"My family and friends all love Oregano's. The food is always excellent and the servers are always super friendly. My all-time favorite dish is something that isn't even on the menu anymore but they still make it on request - the Pasta Basta. It's penne pasta, sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, toasted pine nuts and spicy feta. I always ask for a spoonful of pesto right on the top. Y-U-M-M-Y! It's a huge portion so I usually just eat half and get the other half boxed up. It makes for good leftovers the next day.

We don't usually get dessert at restaurants, but make an exception at Oregano's and always get the pizza cookie. My favorite is half chocolate chip, half white chocolate macadamia nut. I've tried to make it at home but it's just never as good as at Oregano's.

Other things we've had that are excellent: Guacatony, garlic cheese bread, wings, Bistro Classic pizza, baked ziti, Italian sausage sandwich.

All locations are almost always busy, so expect a bit of a wait. It's well worth it though."}
{"text":"So first off... parking here SUCKS! We ended up parking in the staples parking lot after driving around for 10 minutes and never seeing a spot open for parking. We were told 20 minutes when we got here after checking in with the Yelp Waitlist. We are on 40 minutes and counting  and still haven't been seated. The have a \"specific\" table picked out and they're waiting for them to leave. How about we get the first table instead of one you set aside 45 minutes ago? Oregano's food is not good enough to wait an hour WITH A RESERVATION. We ended up leaving after a hour and a half. You aren't Gordon Ramsey. You are a chain restaurant. Get it together."}
{"text":"We came here tonight after a long thought of we should cook or not cook. Miranda was our server and she was amazing. Our food was not as warm as we would have liked and she took charge and got another one made rt away. Then the manager came over to the table and gave us a cookie on the house. Everyone was helping each other. Others would come by and bring the to go boxes.l rt away also. They all were working together and the management is just amazing. One of our favorite spots."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite restaurant. Although wait time could be LONG... make sure you are not starving when coming here.  Service is great, sir at the bar if possible for quick service."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the wait list on today visit. I did this before and it worked exactly the way it was created on today's visit we waited waaaay beyond necessary with the wait list in place. Not sure if it was due to the staff at the hostess stand but highly disappointed"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going there for years (it is walking distance) and the service has always been slow but tonight it was extremely and painfully slow. Our server, Ian, was great but I really don't think we will be going back. It is convenient but this delay with our food was not much fun  especially with kids. Thank you Ian for being such a good sport but otherwise not a good time. I guess the kicker was when we arrived it was not very busy."}
{"text":"BY FAR THE BEST LOCATION !!! This is a wonderful location Aris the manager is always on point with the catering orders I place ! I come here at least 3 times a week for Catering. I was losing hope that oreganos would provide a good service but this location is beyond great! Aris and the staff always go beyond and above to make sure my order is perfect. His attention to detail and flawless execution with the orders make my job easier and I just pick up fast and go to my accounts.  All the team is absolutely great here congrats guys ! I go out of my way since I know my food is going to be good here ALL the time . This place actually does put enough sauce in the orders of pasta which is what matters and the pizza is always on point ."}
{"text":"I cater from oreganos 4 times a week for my accounts. This location is by far the worst for placing catering orderes. They take forever !!! and my pizzas were burnt the manager just said sorry, didn't offer me anything since I was already late by them !! this has happened  few times. The pasta isn't made the way I always get it. Please get together ! I will cater from oreganos but avoid this location and go to other branches now. So disappointed"}
{"text":"Very delicious pizza extremely recommend this place for a date night very lively and a great atom papers !/\" we ordered the antipasto salad it was amazing and a thin crust pizza number one ! Excellent !"}
{"text":"I've been to Oregano's at least twice a year for the past 12 years.  I will not shy away from saying that the original location was BETTER.  Outdoor seating, same crappy parking.  

My rosemary/potato thin crust pizza was burnt!

Not a good experience.  I will try it ONE MORE TIME....."}
{"text":"Love the deep dish pies...only pace that does it as good as Chicago.  Caesar salads are also awesome.  Get there early for lunch.  I got the last deep dish when I was there at about 12:45."}
{"text":"The eclectic atmosphere of sleighs, planes, and other 40's era memorabilia add a nice backdrop to a casual dining experience. 

Came here with 2 coworkers and we enjoyed a generously portioned Mexican salad. The pesto Penni bake was savory and the bread complimented the well. The deep dish pizza is a fine representation of a Chicago style pie. 

Would recommend for a relaxed night out with family and friends."}
{"text":"Food Use to be great but has fallen-still decent but not great.  Service very weak at this location."}
{"text":"Love Oregano's, been coming for years, gonna keep coming back. I always have the thin crust pepperoni, plus occasionally the kick-butt garlic bread & the chocolate chip pizzookie. The food is always fantastic, the service has always been friendly, and the price has always been reasonable."}
{"text":"Oregano's never disappoints, no matter which location I visit. I personally prefer this PV location bc it's less than 2 miles from my house and it's where Richard is the bartender! Over the past couple years I've been coming here he's been so friendly, remembers my name, what I like to eat and drink, and provides the hospitality that Oregano's is famous for.  He has other regulars who visit him as well. Food's always delicious, too! Hot items always come out hot, cold items nice and fresh. I never sit at a table so I can't comment on that experience but the service I receive at the bar is always spot on."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't written a review for this place. This is hands down one of my favorite places on the planet earth. I think they're menu is great!
I love at least one item on every single one of their categories and here they are:
Appetizers:
-boom dip- the real reason I come to this place! It is so delicious. 
-wings: they are huge! And soooo flavorful. 

Salads:
-Caesar: it might sound simple and super common but this one is delicious. Make sure to get it with chicken
- Picasso: what an interesting salad! So good! Salad with a kick! 

Entree:
-Zin City: HUGE! And delicious! You get this and you get food for three days ;)

Pizza:
-Rocky Point: OMG! So delicious! It's like the a taco-pizza and is freaking scrumptious
-Numero One-O: Stuffed gorgeousness! I wish I could put in words how good this is, so since I can't, just get it! It's delicious!

Dessert:
-Pizza Cookie: oh lord! Also one of the main reasons I visit this place! Its gooey deliciousness, topped with ice cream. You get to choose one or two flavors and it is just the best way to end your meal.

Service is great! People are super friendly and their sayings and theme are hilarious! Definitely stop by if you get the chance!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic but very difficult to get fast service-especially at lunch time when you have to go back to work."}
{"text":"Great spinach and artichoke dip.The pizza is ok not to happy with the crumbled sausage :( I rather have the sausage chunks. They had a great cheap lunch menu that I really enjoyed. $5.00 can't beat it with a salad. The unlimited bowls of pasta looked great too. When I come into Arizona next time I'm going to be sure to come on in and enjoy their lunch specials."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. We decided to try it because I've heard good things about their pizza, which definitely did not disappoint. Great outdoor atmosphere. 

We ordered a large pizza and had to wait what seemed like an hour or more for our pizza. In the meantime, people arrived, were served and left. The manager finally came out and explained to us that there had been a mishap in the kitchen and they were working on our pizza now. I'm still not sure what happened but they offered to bring us a free appetizer and to comp our pizza. We politely said no thanks to the extra food, but a manager still brought us a sausage sandwich that they had an \"extra\" of. Though its not something we would have ordered on our own, we still appreciated the gesture.

I just wanted to say that though we ended up spending an extra hour at lunch waiting for our food, the service was great. We appreciated that they took full responsibility for the problem. The pizza was great and well worth the wait.  I recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, waiter joked around with us, and the kitchen will even sub pasta for broccoli! (I was very excited about this, although I'm sure most reading this will think I'm a nut case)
VERY good value especially for the price. They give you plenty of food for a reasonable price, and the patio is great!"}
{"text":"Love this place and have been a consistent customer for 15+ years. I regularly visit with family and friends, especially when entertaining out-of-state visitors (because they always ask to go back)! Unfortunately all good things must come to an end... 

Tonight we were celebrating a recent high school graduate and birthday, neighborhood kinda stuff! This location was more focused on serving the Mystery Dinner Theater than it was its tried and true customers, truly a disappointment..."}
{"text":"Love the food. Service not so much. An hour for thin crust pizza and a salad. Really?

Update: Stephanie from Oregano's reached out to me. She was generally concerned about my experience. Thanks for following up."}
{"text":"Food is good but service stunk on our first visit to this location. Girl asked for drink orders, we asked for water all around, my wife asked for lemonade and then the girl left  without asking anyone else and i wanted a beer. Plus we were starving and we were ready to order. When she came back i ordered the Bol O Pasta with meat sauce. It's free refills so I figured I'd have two bowls and maybe take part of a third bowl home.   It came with marinara so they had to take it back and bring the right order. Then my wife ran out of lemonade and the girl was nowhere to be found . Nobody else came by to even check how our food was or if we needed anything. When I finished my plate I asked for a refill and the girl came back 15 minutes later and asked if we wanted to-go boxes. I asked if my second was still coming and she said it was on its way. It's basic spaghetti with sauce. How long does that take?  By the time she finally brought with the to go containers the rest of the family was ready to go and antsy and I still had half a beer left. So instead of sitting there and enjoying it I had to chug my beer and get my pasta to go. Definitely not a great customer service experience"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my family. Huge portions and great food and service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We've only tried the pizza and garlic bread (with cheese!) here, but they've been delicious.  Our favorite is the pan pizza, which is like deep dish, and has a lightly crispy crust that's still soft and chewy beyond the edge and base.  They're generous with their toppings, and the pizza has a good balance between cheese, sauce, and toppings.  

Their customer service is also tops - we made an order via Postmates, and there was an error made when Postmates placed our order, and despite it not being Oregano's fault, they re-made our item at no charge and we picked it up ourselves."}
{"text":"Im updating my review and adding a star because the waiter and the food were AMAZING. However, they really should ask is you would like to sit outside or inside BEFORE putting your name in the list, and why cant you make a reservation? Also i would ratger sit at a table (because there were A LOT open) and let you wait till a server was available. Since their waiting are is small and hardly there. I also found it annoying that there were many waiters or bussers just wandering around the restaurant lookong bored. 

Hopefully they will get better! Im rooting for them! The Oregeno's in Phoenix is awesome eventhough they sometimes have a long wait time."}
{"text":"We dined there last week, the place was so loud several people complained. The service was poor, forgot to add ingredients to the salad so had to ask for them. The pizza took over an hour, however others around us who sat down 15-20min after us got their meal before us. The pizza was also mediocre and forgot to add the extra toppings we asked for."}
{"text":"I had been a loyal client to Oreganos for many years; today our relationship ended. I had noticed a steady decline over the past couple years based on some menu changes all geared toward bottom line profit. I get it, and have no problem with it, IF, the service and product remains consistent. For instance, you used to get all drummies when you ordered wings, now you get a mix and only 10. They've started using chips and now up-charge for waffle fries. The quality in the food product continues to decline while demanding more from the consumer. 

I made a to go order and after driving 20 minutes to get it and get back home I find that it's wrong (wrong type of wings) and one of the items was horribly made. I called and commented on the experience and although they reversed the charges (what they should do) I have decided that there are too many options with more consistency and care for the client. Putting profits before people is a poor model and Oreganos used to be an establishment where great food paired with great value was served by incredible people; that is no longer the case in my opinion. 

I bid you farewell and truly hope you get it back on track, I absolutely loved this place."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment after our first visit was great. Waitress was very poorly prepared and trained. Not worth the money. We waited 45 minutes before getting food and we had to send our spinich back since they put cheese. The manager did her best but we will be hesitant to go back. Pizza dough is good and atmosphere is pleasant but pricing is too high. Brussel sprouts are quite good. Hope they get it together since there are not a ton of choices around."}
{"text":"Parking is a joke, limited seating (especially inside) is among the worst of all popular restaurants in Arizona, and the crowd of college kids and self-styled Mill Ave. area business professional types makes for one annoying dining experience.  I've wondered why the owners bother to choose these locations, especially in areas that have horrible street parking when the daily event of overflowing parking occurs.  You have to realize this ruins the whole experience from the start.   It's all fabricated hype - excessively limit the seating and parking, always have a waitlist, and viola you've created the appearance of overflowing demand.

If you go immediately when they open you can often get a seat at the bar and then things are tolerable - just get the individual slices with beer and they'll get you in and out of there fast.  You won't have to listen to complicated explanations for why their pizza takes so long.  They also haven't adjusted the music volume up louder and louder yet either, so again... go when they open.  The fried spicy ravioli are tasty, but I'm struggling to say something positive here."}
{"text":"This restaurant chain location is special because it is one of the few with adequate parking.  I'm sure it must have been an accident.  Just go to the Camelback, Scottsdale Rd, or Tempe locations to see the norm for this.

This location has run out of the Four Peaks draft beer on several occasions that I have arrived.  They offer their own house brew and their servers are completely ignorant concerning what style it is.  Their impromptu attempts at describing it are often contradictory, and nobody here knows this difference between an ale and a lager.

The wall paintings aren't as nice at the Shea location as others, but they seem to have a better turnaround and slightly less wait time than some of the other locations.  Maybe it is because people give up on the wait list and go next door to the other pizzaria?

This place is all about the image - the atmosphere, colorful menu, and silly T-shirts.  Food is pretty much average and bears little resemblance to genuine Chicago fare."}
{"text":"Fabricated hype is the theme for this restaurant chain in Arizona - they intentionally select (nearly) all locations with insufficient parking and insufficient building size to accommodate their customers.  Once you're on the lengthy waitlist along with a small crowd of others, they want you to think.... wow, this is a happening place!

But the pain doesn't stop here.  The hostess has strict but unreasonable seating rules.  Example: she wouldn't seat my party of 4 at a 4 top table because 2 people were parking the car.  Not even 30 seconds later, she seats a party of 2 at that last remaining 4 top table.  Then, of course, my 2 missing people walk right up and we have to wait 25 minutes for the next available 4 top table.  Great policy, Oreganos!

This self-styled Chicago theme restaurant offers deep dish pizza, but they're quick to point out how long the wait is for the pizza (likely after you've waited a long time just to get a seat) and so the vast majority of their pizza sales are thin crust.  Not bad, but the reputation for great Chicago pizza isn't exactly \"Chicago thin crust\".

Wall murals are entertaining, as are the self-deprecating T-shirts worn by the staff.  Food is very average, and the menu is quite decorative.

On the whole though, it's all hype and little in way of substance."}
{"text":"Fried Raviolis were ice cold in the middle (pulled from frier too soon).  Replacement order had raviolis with no cheese in them at all because they bubbled out (too long in the deep frier).  They just can't get it right.  And at the end of it all, the entrees came before the fixed appetizer came, yet I was never offered a comp, dessert, etc. for the major PITA.  

Parking is insufficient here at the location itself, but if you rely on the huge mall parking then things aren't too bad.  It's just a miracle how this chain finds so many places with insufficient parking relative to the seating size inside.

Hit the Shea location if you want their tasty food without all of the problems that this place has."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Oreganos location for parking.  Back in the 1990's they just had the one small building with a handful of spots, and everyone else was forced onto find a spot outside on one of the busiest streets in Scottsdale (Scottsdale Rd.).  The place always had long lines and a long waitlist, and even a decade ago they knew it was a problem.

To remedy the problem, they added on a small shack sized structure that is adjacent to the original building.  Great!  It's as if they didn't get the memo, and decided to add on something provided little relief to the problem they already have.

The atmosphere with painted wall murals is probably one of the better locations in Arizona, because the limited parking area is painted as well.  Wait times are on par with the other locations.

Decorative menu is the same (Oreganos is an Arizona chain restaurant).  Food quality is the same as the other locations, and bears little resemblance to authentic Chicago pizza and Italian fare.  Service is inconsistent, and usually poor.

This place is a snowbird trap, so you're better off to avoid it in the winter months."}
{"text":"Just when it looked like a normal parking lot I drove back and found a plethora of open parking spots... but then they all said reserved for such and such business (not Oreganos).  They managed to do it again - find a location with inadequate parking, except this one's in mesa.  Restaurant size was better than the others, but it is plagued with Millennial college kids from across the street.  

Food & menu are no different than the other locations as far as I can tell, and thankfully I was in and out rather quickly with my 2 slices and Hefe-Weizen.  Service was a little slow which is frustrating when you're at the bar and you see the bartender having personal conversations with other staff."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. We were prepared for a mediocre experience from a chain restaurant. We were very pleasantly surprised. The staff were super friendly. We were waiting on friends so we sat at the bar for an hour. The bartender let us sample an amazing drink, the Bellini, that we saw someone else with. The carne asada pizza was absolutely fantastic. My wife said it was the best pizza she'd ever had. We look forward to trying a location closer to home."}
{"text":"Drove 5 1/2 hours from Covina and  waited 1 1/2 to get. Seated.  Ordered a deep dish and said another 1 1/2 wait.  Ridiculous won't come baxk."}
{"text":"best Italian food hands down!!! biggest portion you get your moneys worth and top quality food. Employees are great and food is amazing like i said best Italian food in az! hands down"}
{"text":"I traveled to Arizona for work and was told to expect amazing food. Oreganos was the last restaurant I went to on my last day in town, I had been unimpressed for two straight weeks but oreganos wipes the bitter taste right out of my mouth! We sat on their gorgeous patio and enjoyed two pizzas (a thin crust and a thick Chicago style pizza) stuffed mushrooms and fries. Every single item that touched my tongue was perfect. Delicious food all seasoned to perfection and worth the wait. The wine list was a nice touch too. Nothing worse than a restaurant that gives you a teensy tiny glass of wine - oreganos did not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"I guess, in Tempe, this is the place with the most interesting ambience. Its traditional vintage Italian restaurant and there is always something interesting anywhere you look, from vintage motorcycle to amazingly graphic menu booklets. The customer service is pretty good and its usually quite busy on Fridays and weekend. You may have to wait for hours if you don't reserve. About the food, I am not a connoisseur when it comes to Italian, but I liked it and my friends did too. But this place deserves a visit atleast for tasting its ambience."}
{"text":"We just held out annual Holiday party here and at first I was unsure of how good the party would be but let me just say...wow! First of all we had about 40 of us and 3 waiters all of which were phenomenal. Not once did I even have a moment to question where one was because they were always there grabbing orders or requests. To top it all of one of our waiters Christian granted the wish of a coworker by confidently strutting down the runway which really topped the night off!! Staff, food and drinks were incredible. I was extremely impressed"}
{"text":"The wait to get seated was very short. The food was great. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food. One of our favorite things to do is add buffalo sauce to the Caesar dressing before we add it to our salad. It's surprisingly good. Pretty much anything you get here will be delicious. It would definitely be a mistake not to get a pizookie before you head out."}
{"text":"this is our usual first stop for happy hour on Fridays. We love the staff! and the 3 dollar heck of a slice ain't too shabby either! 
ps Beth is the best hostess ever!"}
{"text":"I want to start out by saying my daughters favorite restaurant is Oreganos and we have visited many locations. All of them I have received excellent service and chow.. This is the first place I've thought deserves less then 4 stars. 

I brought my daughter in around 330pm on a Friday afternoon to get a quick bite before a concert we were going to. Walking in is just like any other Oreganos. We were on a time crunch (1hr) to get some chow and be back on the road. We ordered some drinks from the waitress who was totally on the order and friendly. After we got our drinks and placed our order, another waiter told us he was taking over since our waitress had gotten off of work. No worries I thought. I ordered a Small Pizza, and my daughter got Pasta. 30 minutes after I ordered I was thinking ok, now we are having a issue because we got to go. The place was empty except for a few tables, however food seemed to slowly... I repeat... Slowly drizzle out of the kitchen. I told our waiter we had to go and got our check and paid ahead of time. Another 10 min went by and our food finally came out. Seriously, 40 minutes... He had a few minutes to eat and get going so we weren't late for our meet and greet with the band. Aside from just being slow with food, the waiter seemed to not really care all. Ill mark this location down as one to not visit."}
{"text":"Why do I feel like Oreganos is losing their vibe and friendliness.... We came to this ocation before the Dierks Bentleys concert because my daughter LOOOVES Oreganos. We did the call ahead on Yelp and arrived within the time frame. The place seemed really slow, so they led us right in to sit. My first problem of the afternoon is they led us to a back shack looking thing that had no AC, flies were everywhere and well.... It had NO AC! It honestly looks like MR. Oregano walked in and said \"we don't need this storage area, in order to make more money lets empty this shack out and sit idiots in here\"... I had to suck it in in order to get into my booth. Now, anyone who knows me knows im a big dude as in weightlifting... Not overweight.... As I sat uncomfortably the chipper waiter walked up and asked what he can get us for drinks. Before anyone could say anything, I asked him if he can get us a table in the main dining area, where they have AC, no flies, and im not feeling like im in a old storage facility. He walked off annoyed saying he would check... Came back a min later and said they were completely full in there, and what could he get us to drink... I didn't let it go, I asked him how it was slammed if the parking lot was dead. At this point my wife reeled me in and I just dropped it. I asked for a water with lemon and a Dos Equis with 2 limes... At this point im annoyed, sweaty, swapping flies, and wanting to order to go to sit in the car and eat. The waiter brings us our waters and my beer, drops it off and takes, he didn't even wait for me to tell him my limes were brown and old (old, brown limes give beer a nasty flavor). He came back about 15 min later asking if we were ready to order... Uh, yeah bro its been forever in restaurant time, Jon Taffer would have shut your ass down by now... I let the beer thing go again and just ordered pizza... We didn't see him for another 30 minutes when our pizza came out and he quickly delivered it and took off again... I had to get up and stop him to ask for my check and boxes for our pizza. He said \"Right away\"... Well, right away truned into another r15 minutes of waiting till I finally asked a busser for boxes. This was the first time I have left 0 In tip. I did not feel bad at all... Slowly, Oreganos has been going from a top, fun, vibey place to a dud... Honestly, I would have rather ordered to go and eaten in my car then to deal with this guy, or the seating."}
{"text":"I know its valentines day... Places are slammed.... However, oreganos online wait list shows 39-45 for seating... So i figure if i get it to go it should be,much quicker since they are much bussier on the weekends. So I call.... Ringing and commercials for 11 minutes i get... When the guy finally answers i explained 11 minutes without a simple greeting is excessive to say the least. Is the most condescending way he states \"dont know if you know this, but we are very popular\".... I guess that was his explanations... I just get to it, \"let me place a order\"... He states next pickup will be in a hour and a half.... So seating is only 39-45 minutes but to pick up food i have to wait till 8pm? This makes no sense... Again he explained \"you must not know, bit we are very popular\"... Poor customer service skills, poor service overall if they are making people wait a hour and a half for phone in orders..... Unacceptable, since this conversation was with Jason the manager.."}
{"text":"Great time with good friends.  We all enjoy our meals at Oregano's but our Russian speaking waitress, Veronica, made this visit even more special.  The food was good, service was better, could not have asked for more!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to this Oregano's and it was just like the other Oregano's that we've been to, AWESOME!  Always get service that is as good as the food that they serve us.  It was our good fortune to have Robin take care of us today.  She did you good Oregano's!"}
{"text":"All kinds of options up and down Bell Rd but we chose Oregano's because the service is always so good.  Today was no exception.  Alyssa took very good care of us, helped us to make some great choices and the Big Beefstro Salad paired with the Flag Lasagna was just right!  Thank you for yet another fine dining experience!"}
{"text":"Finally!!! A yummy pizza joint in our 'hood.  Happy dance.  Super crispy crust, fresh toppings and good cheese.  Did take out so next time should dm in restaurant to try full menu."}
{"text":"Second time coming in and it was great. Our Server, Sarah was awesome. She knew the menu more than enough to explain to myself all of my many questions and hesitations and recommended an amazing pasta bowl which was A+. Always on top of our refills and ready/eager to answer our novice questions. Definitely will be returning again in the future"}
{"text":"Worse experience I ever had here. I waited for almost 30min to get seated and it was so hot in the lobby by the time my family and I got a table I was too hot to eat and felt like I was going to pass out.

{"text":"Can go wrong with this place I love it. Food is always great. Been dining at this restaurant for more than 15 years. Too bad they don't have the personalized beer cups anymore, please bring them back I need the new locations cups Tucson's, Elliot location and the one on the west side I have been to all of them."}
{"text":"We have been to several other Oregano's but this was our first time here, and we were not disappointed.  We ordered the calamari and it was very tasty and not rubbery. We had the thin crust pizza and it was perfect.

{"text":"Took all my kids here for dinner.  They could not believe the portions that were given.  I had the endless angel-hair pasta with meat sauce.  One ordered a chicken dish and the other a pizza.  What splendid food.  Very reasonable priced.  Will definetly be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for lunch with business friends. Service is usually excellent, and their lunch specials are outstanding. The antipasto salad, and calzone are favorites."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get pizza and beer with friends in Tempe. This place has a tendency to get busy and parking is terrible, though, so try to go during not peak times, and definitely carpool or ride share."}
{"text":"great place to go for a wide range of Italian cuisine. my daughter's and I came to this location for a late night dinner. initial wait time was 25 minutes but we got in around 15 minutes later. my gurls ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and buffalo wings, I got the extra large chicken caesar salad, drinks and water with refills. the staff was nice, our waiter was awesome and prompt. and the atmosphere was just what you would expect at an Italian restaurant. this is my gurls favorite Italian place and we'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service!!!  Price was reasonable as well.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  The atmosphere is always awesome, the Bellini's are fabulous must have drinks and the food is wonderful.  Everyone must try the Mama's Chicken Rosemary Pizza... and if your a pasta lover, try the big rig with angel hair and chicken (its a spicy alfredo sauce dish of yummy goodness that just makes me happy every time I eat it).  Last off, never forget to get a pizza cookie...nothing, and i mean nothing beats this dessert.  This place will never be anything but a favorite of mine, even if we do have to wait 1.5 hrs for a table on busy weekend nights... just means more time to have a drink and chat with friends on the patio.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love the food here but this location is just not up to par with the rest. The bathroom was disgusting and our pizza took 45 minutes (just a plain thin crust). Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Awesome Clark Street Meat pizza with wonderful dinner salads to accompany it.  Ask for Taylor to serve you. She is as good a waitress as the food is. You won't leave disappointed. Like Arnold says, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has medicore ratings. I thought it was great. I came here with my fiancee and a couple of family friends that we were visiting in town. We all split a \"big\" Picasso salad (the smallest size) and between four of us, we couldn't finish it. That being said, it was delicious!

The pizza was also great. The crust was nice and crispy and the toppings were great. Bonus points for bringing out a plate of real parmesan. Calamari was great also. I would definitely come back the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"I eat at oreganos a lot, dine in and take out and they're always fabulous. I love their salads and wings and yum yum EVERYTHING!!! 

Order the peach Bellini and the guacatoni to get started, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Yeah the pasta and the pizza is good we all know that.

What really gets me though are the clever innuendo based phrases on the backs of the employee's shirts.

\"Legalize Marinara\" 

Pretty clever.

I want to challenge oregano's to push the envelope and start doing famous movie quotes riddled with their Italian food puns!

\"I love scamp(i).\"

Side Note: I would also like to see some pastafarian jokes.

Where is the giant spaghetti monster??"}
{"text":"When you first get here the first thing you notice is the great atmosphere. The nights starts out good by being in a nice place then you have the food that is amazing."}
{"text":"Even better than I remember! Parking was easy even on Friday night. Short wait to eat inside or we could have been seated immediately outside. We chose inside seating. The calamari was amazing and even the 9 and 6 year old ate some! We had the Puerto Penasco Carne Street Pie on thin crust and it was AWESOME. The kids ate their noodles with various toppings. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating for our family of 5. It was great to come back to Phoenix and get enjoy one of our favorite places that's still rocking it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! We went recently to celebrate my friends bday and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and friendly service. My favorite pizza is the rosemary chicken potato with a side ranch :)"}
{"text":"So delicious!!! Had the Bowl o pasta! Talk about a killer deal great price and you get to take some home! Bomb garlic bread! Pizza is great, Italian gold wings! Wow!! They are flavorful!"}
{"text":"We love Oreganos, are usual location is on Bell Rd but we moved to Tolleson and had no idea of this location until we googled it. We went on a Saturday evening so naturally it was busy especially being the weekend before Valentine's day. Our wait was long, about 45 mins and honestly we never wait that long anywhere but we did hoping that it would go faster which it didn't but it was ok. We finally got a table and our waiter was Andrew let me say he was great! Very friendly and attentive great waiter! We had never ordered the meat pizza I can't remember the actual name of it but it was so dang good, ordered our usual of medium wings, and the gold, and the Pablo Picasso. Everything was excellent... This will be our new location."}
{"text":"Went here with my carpool buddy after work last Thursday. We realized that we were driving into the haboob so we decided to pull over and duck into the nearest place we could find. I was in great despair at where we found ourselves since I had just started a new low-carb diet and also wasn't drinking. But I ended up having a great meal anyway. 

We sat in the bar since all the tables in the restaurant area were full. But this worked out great since the bar has a big window overlooking Scottsdale Road so we were able to monitor the storm's progress. The place was packed but had a good, lively vibe since all the servers were very friendly and seemed to be having a good time in spite of being at work. I was all set to order one of the sandwiches without bread but the bartender suggested ordering just a side of some meatballs and sauce. This is considered an add-on to the pasta dishes and so it was only $3.99. Such a great deal for a really yummy dinner! My companion got some kind of chicken sandwich and a glass of wine which she really enjoyed. The sand which came with sweet potato fries and she said that she didn't care for them but I managed to stay strong and not sample any so I can't really comment on how good they are. Overall, a pleasurable evening, in spite of the storm and the place being very crowded. 

PS: An added perk that made the visit even more enjoyable (well, at least for my friend who is a reality TV junkie) is that one of the servers was Alex from Real World Denver."}
{"text":"Excellent meal we did have an hour wait but the food was worth it. We sat outside by the swamp cooler and that made it bearable to be outside in the Arizona heat. Garlic cheese bread with marinara was still good, the garlic o salt and cheese ratio on this cooked to perfection bread was on point. The salads we ordered, 1 could have feed all 5 adults. The ranch and Italian dressing were both very good. Chicago pepperoni pizza was really good very close to Chiicago pizza very close. Hubby got a chipotle pasta with shrimp said it was excellent chile lime wings were very good too. Mushroom bacon pizza hey said it was very good. Service was excellent this is a must try when in Arizona."}
{"text":"Doesn't get better than this. Service is usually amazing, haven't had many issues with the staff, if any. 
Their deep dish is to die for! Usually I'm not a thin crust gal but even their thin crust is great!
Cheesy garlic bread is an amazing starter! The \"KaBoom Dip\" wasn't impressive.
Their \"original pizza cookie\" (aka pizookie) is the best around. BJ's has NOTHING on this desert. The cookie dough is lightly baked so it feels like you're eating raw cookie dough and ice cream.
Biggest plus? AMAZING PRICES!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service as well as food! Their deep dish (pan) pizza takes a little while to make so its best to call ahead if you want the pan so they can start it while you're on your way."}
{"text":"How could you ever go bad with Oregano's?  The only complaint I have is that ALL the food has some sort of spice in it...!"}
{"text":"The wait was 40 minutes with an early check in app but the food is always amazing. This was the best gluten free pizza (with bacon) that I have had and that includes some famous pizza places in the valley. The server was great and personable and the random waiter that walked by got my pregnant wife some gsrlic bread since she was getting hungry and needed to etc. They were very understanding and cut my pie into small pieces to help me with my braces."}
{"text":"I have been to Gilbert location many times and have always been pleased.  This location,  not so much.  I live in Gilbert but work in Tempe.  I have taken two orders to go.  The meatball sandwich was very dry and hardly any marinara.  The big rig pasta was way overcooked and was mushy. Not sure why the two restaurants are so different in the way its prepared.  Bottom line is I love oreganos but if you get disappointed here,  hit the downtown Gilbert location to see what it should taste like."}
{"text":"Love this place! Only once had I gotten poor service (out of the many times we've gone), other than that fluke the whole staff is great. The food is amazing (though the pasta could use a little extra sauce), and well priced. Though if you go on peak hours, expect to wait, they can get very busy!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza joint. Zack, our server, was extremely friendly and laughed when i called him Adam all during lunch. The wings were good and the thin crust pizza was excellent. A good value for your money.  Another wonderful place in Gilbert and we shall be back!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here from the pizza to the pasta to the Cesar salad to the cocktails!  My favorite is the Dirty Monkey and put that with the stuffed rigatoni.  Must be prepared to wait to eat here but man it's worth the wait!  Kinda wish you could call ahead and put your name on the waiting list butt hey usually bring little snacks to everyone while you wait ."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is soooo worth going!

First of all, I don't like cheese pizza OR thin crust, but theirs is amazing. For their \"Midday Rush\" deals, we were able to get a huge slice of cheese pizza for only $2.99! (These slices are a bit larger than a sams club \"slice\" of pizza...the image I attached will give you an idea).

We also got some Italian Gold wings which were okay.... the Garlic Parmesan are wayyyy better and came with a side of chips. Also, their side of fries were waffle style and are delicious and crispy. PS, their salads are HUGE. For $9, you can feed two people right there with just that one dish. My husband really like their Arnold Palmers too, you can tell it's not cheap watered down lemonade. 

Lastly, I really appreciated their fresh parmesan that was available for the food. You don't get the fake powdered stuff, you get the REAL cheese!

All in all, I had a wonderful experience here and will be back! I must warn that their Tempe location is a 1 star review (and that's being nice). But THIS ONE had great customer service and left a great impression."}
{"text":"My friend and I went into the Surprise location yesterday and we ordered 3 things and a small pizza. We received our three items fairly fast but our pizza never did come out and after an hour and watching others who came in after us get their pizza we finally kept asking the bar tender and after not getting anywhere I requested the manager. When he finally came over we explained our frustration and that we had to leave and he said that he could credit us the $14.95 but would we take a gift card. Really? We spent over $100 with our three wine orders each and that was it? We paid tip and tax on that and he proceeded to try and tell us that the timer on our order was only 10 minutes ago and on about what had happened. He was the worst and most unprofessional manager I have ever dealt with. We told him things happen and we all have experiences and we were good until he didn't offer us anything else and then tried to tell us that it was basically was our fault as the order just got in. By this time we had been there over 90 minutes. His name by the way is Roy. Oregano's, who is doing your hiring? He also was asking what we would like to do of which I said you should not ask us, you should had gave us some options on how you should remedy this and not just with taking that off our bill and not adding the tax back in was wrong as well. This was my 4th time there as I have a home here but live in Seattle. This was my friends first time and she was also appalled by this guys handing of this. The food though is awesome!"}
{"text":"Fifty minute wait for our order during lunch when it wasn't busy at all.  The waitress didn't seem to want to pay much attention to us or offer any kind of information as to what the status of our order was.  The food was alright but the customer service was poor.  Will not be coming back and wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place, been going for years and have never had a bad experience.  There have been a few, less than the usual best, but never bad.

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Wings, cheesy garlic bread, pizza (stuffed or thin), salads, sandwiches.  Everything is consistently great and the staff is friendly and accommodating. 

There's generally a wait during the weekends, but you can usually find a drink at the bar while you wait.

I do miss the original Scottsdale location..."}
{"text":"Great place to have a family dinner. Outdoor seating is great to get some fresh air while enjoying their delicious menu items. I wish they had this chain in California! I have to stop in everyone I'm visiting Arizona. The food is great, the customer service is wonderful and the atmosphere is very family oriented."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure coming into this establishment. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is great. Can't ask for much more than that. I'm definitely going to be a regular here once I move to Arizona in a couple of weeks."}
{"text":"The food was great and the portions were HUGE!  Plenty to bring home for left-overs.  But more importantly was the service we received.  Alyssa R was totally awesome.  Not only was she attentive in our needs, but what a personality.  Nobody likes a grouchy server.  Alyssa was far from that.  Always a pleasant smile and very pleasant on concerned with our needs."}
{"text":"We called at 4:15 to order two dinner salads.  The person on the phone said that \"the next time she could get something out of the kitchen\" for takeout was 7:20.  That's right... a 3 hour and 5 minute wait for two dinner salads... for takeout.

Even better, the person on the phone was shocked, just shocked, that we had a problem with waiting over three hours for a takeout order."}
{"text":"I wanted to put a rebuttal on here for the dude who thinks it's \"idiotic\" to complain about wait times for a new restaurant. 

I've gone by 3 times for lunch.  Each time, I've been told there's over an hour wait.  Each time, I wandered through the restaurant only to find open tables, bored looking wait staff and zero sense of urgency.  I left all three times and went across the street to competitors and sat down immediately. 

While the location is new, the chain is not. 

What is \"idiotic\" is opening up a popular chain restaurant in an area that's dying for one and have piss poor planning when it turns out that it actually has customers. 

I'm not sure if the management of this place is inept or apathetic....but one thing is for sure....they surely don't appreciate your time or business. 

Stay far away."}
{"text":"The best ever pizza sausage and meatballs and I drank a dirty monkey I definitely recommend will be back next year"}
{"text":"If I were ever to be grossly obese and it were due to the fact that I stuffed myself with Oregano's on a daily basis, I think I'd be willing to set my vanity aside and be quite content with that fact. 

Needless to say, this is not a place to go while you are on a diet. This is the place to go when you want a good ol' fashioned carb overload Italian style. I consume more carbs in one meal here than I do in a month of eating at home. And I love every gluten filled bite of it. 

Notable items: 

Cheesy bread - two foot long loaf of soft wonderful white bread slathered in garlic butter with oodles of melty cheddar cheese blend. GAWD. This is my favorite thing on the menu. I don't even try to pretend I'm not a gluttonous pig when it comes to this stuff and I always help myself to the last piece. 

Wings- BIG FAT drumsticks. All of them. Honey hot is delish along with the buffalo. 

Caesar salad - holy crap their salads are huge. They have three sizes. The full (or whatever they call it) is big enough for four or five people to eat from if it isn't the main dish. 

Bollo Pasta - with meatballs - Angel hair pasta and marinara with two huge meatballs, oh and the pasta is never ending. I have yet to see anyone get more than halfway through the first round though. *note angel hair being so thin sometimes the pasta has come out mushy(overcooked), all I've had to do was mention it and the problem was remedied in a very timely manner usually followed up by a manager visit, they don't mess around with customer service. 

Pizookie - Obvi. 

No, it isn't the best Italian I've EVER had but it is solid and consistent and really hits the spot when you want your fix. And the pricing is awesome. Lisa E, Nydia A and I binged at the one on Shea a couple of months ago, had the cheesy bread, wings and pizookie and our bill was $20. We sat there staring at the bill and each other dumbfounded for a couple of minutes. 

If you don't like this place, all I have to say is \"Wanna PIZZA me?!\" ;)"}
{"text":"Read great reviews but was very disappointed in our pizza and breadsticks. We got the pesto pizza with chicken as recommended and garlic cheese bread. Also was charged for 2oz side of ranch."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at Oregano's. My friend and I were going there about once a month for a year and a half while we were in school. I had never been here so she introduced me. I have now been there several times and this is my favorite of the locations. The tasters I've tried are the toasted ravioli espaniol, boom dip, guaca tony, and Lawrence's stuffed mushrooms.  The ravioli is divine with a nice kick in the cheese and the marinara is my favorite of all of the the marinaras I have tasted.  The boom dip is rich and creamy and the chips are actually a thin crust pizza with cheese on top, there are no words to describe how absolutely wonderful it is.  The guaca tony has the same thin crust pizza to smear guac on and from what I hear the guac is phenomenal, stupid allergies prohibit me tasting.  The stuffed mushrooms are more of a meal than a taster and are a lot meatier than I had imagined but was rich and delicious.  If you get tasters just know that they are huge and that if you plan on dessert it is important to have plenty of people to share with unless you plan on not eating lunch/dinner. 
In regards to the wings my husband has thoroughly enjoyed the wings of fire and says that they are a different kind of hot more black pepper than hot sauce hot.  He says that they were surprising but that they were a good change.  
The salads are like everything else on the menu huge and a little different.  The Julius Caesar has a dressing that is Caesar with a little bit of a different kick.  I normally ask for extra dressing but there was flavor in every bite.  When you add chicken it is finally sliced and you can never get a bite without the chicken, I usually share this with my daughter because it is just to big for one person.  My husband has said that the big beefstro and the antipasto thing are both the best salads he has ever had.  This is high praise since he tends to not like going out.  Every time we have gone out since he compares every salad he comes in contact with the salads from Oregano's and so his taste for other salads has become ruined.  My father-in-law says that the southwestern shrimp caesar is better than he ever imagined.  The shrimp was so tasty that even I liked it and my daughter started trying to steal salad.  
We have tried two of the sandwiches sort of on accident.  The Italian stuffed and the fresh grilled Italian sausage.  My mother-in-law meant to order the fresh grilled Italian sausage but accidentally said the Italian stuffed and when it came out she said it was delicious but that she wanted the sausage and mentioned it to the waitress.  The waitress reordered the sausage sandwich and wrapped it up for her to take home and didn't even charge us for it.  I think this really says something about the level of customer service that I have seen every time we go.  We all tasted both and my mother-in-law who is rarely impressed has suggested this place numerous times based on this, oh and dessert. 
The pizzas are great. I normally don't like the thin crust but feel that they pack a lot in. I read in a review that the Aunt Margarita had no flavor which I thought was odd. It definitely isn't as greasy as some of the pizzas but it has some darn good flavor. The tomatoes are always done just right to give you that juicy tomato quality.
My daughter always gets the pasta with the pesto sauce.  She loves the pesto and enjoys the pesto penne bake.  I truly love the ziti since it is flavorful and huge enough for three meals.  I don't really like their Alfredo the dark but it isn't the worst alfredo that I have had.  
For dessert I have only ever had their pizza cookie and don't see any reason to change this in the future.  I have had pizza cookie at many places but non that are even close to as yummy as the ones her at Oregano's.  
You will definitely find me at an Oregano's again soon."}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted! On one hand, we were able to get seated in under five minutes of arriving. On the other hand, the food didn't sing to me, but rather just hummed along to a common theme. 

Evidently, not drinking alcohol has either effected my taste buds or my perception of food, because I cannot honestly say I was impressed with last night's meal. The Boom Dip appetizer was okay, after adding red pepper flakes. But the Alfredo The Dark with chicken was such a limp noodle for me. Was that really chicken lunch meat sliced thick in my pasta? The cheese wasn't melted, and I couldn't find any alfredo sauce in my pasta bowl. Par for the course, I ended up getting full and bringing about half of the dish home. If, at lunch, I decide this was a good meal and I was just misguided by not having alcohol with my food, I shall update my review."}
{"text":"Best Stuffed pizza in Phoenix hands down. Way better then their competition on Camelback"}
{"text":"We have been frequenting Oregano restaurants for years and were ecstatic when Glendale finally opened. It might not be the most authentic Italian food but it's always been consistent and good. We love the friendly staff and atmosphere. As long as you go right when they open at 11am or for an early dinner there typically is no wait. #lovethepizzacookie"}
{"text":"Usually when I come here the service is spectacular, however today when I had come in they where on a wait, which is okay, however she had told us it would be right around 15 to 20 minutes and we waited near 40 minutes. We got sat, ordered our drinks immediately took another 30 to get our drinks (non alcoholic came out instantly.) right after I got my alcoholic drink the food came out. There where 4 people standing around the bar when I had went to the bathroom, I saw my drink sitting there and about 20 other drinks sitting there as well, KEEP IN MIND FOUR PEOPLE WHERE STANDING THERE TALKING, AND LAUGHING HAVING A GRAND OL TIME ONE BEING THE MANAGER. Our server came to check up on our table about 2 times... over all not a great experience this time around."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and our friends raved about the pizza here...we were quite disappointed. For starters, we understand waiting a while to get seated on a busy night, bur several of the female waitresses seemed to have friends who they sat ahead of us an many other guests who had been waiting a long time. Our order was taken quickly, but the food took forever to arrive! And the food was just ok, nothing exciting. Also, my wife ordered a water along with her margarita, and never got it until we flagged down our waitress to remind her. The waitress didn't follow up with us after delivering the food. We also finished off with the ice cream cookie and that was super mushy."}
{"text":"This place is so very nearly a 4/5. The flavor here is very specific and fairly unique. It's definitely good eats. 

The place is too packed most of the time for my liking, but it's only packed because it's popular - and it's mainly popular because it's good.

It's a great place for lunch - as long as you don't have anywhere to be afterward. The primary reason for this not being a 4 start joint is that there are just too many pizza places I'd rather eat at before this one. However, now that I've decided to finally write a review for it, I kinda feel like having it again. It's been awhile. Guess that says something.

When the weather is nice - spring and fall - sitting outside on the patio is a good time."}
{"text":"Went to Oreganos with my boyfriend tonight - had the Lady is a Scampi and a pazookie (you've gotta try it!) Food was great as always, but the service was what really stood out - Luana was our server, and she was fantastic! :)"}
{"text":"Finally had oreganos for the first time and I absolutely loved it! The food was amazing! We had the bruschetta authentico with pesto as an appetizer and oh my gosh! It was so good! I wanted to eat it all but I ordered dinner as well and didn't want to fill up on bread. For dinner I had the El Diablo shrimp pasta and my room mate had the chicken parmesan sandwich. The sandwich was to die for, the chicken was flavorful and crispy and the coleslaw and fries were just perfect. I know this because I ate half of his sandwich due to the fact that I could not eat my pasta! It was way too spicy for me. (I love spicy, and we both agreed that it was pretty Damn spicy) I'm only giving four stars because we also ordered wings as an appetizer as well and we received them after we got our dinner. We only ate one because we were full and over it so we packed them togo. We did order alot of food but I'd rather have microwaved pasta than reheated wings. But other than that everything was great.

Oh! And whoever was bartending that night, kudos to ya because those Moscow mules were on point! So delish and refreshing! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night with a group of 20 people. We called in about an hour ahead to let them know we were coming with a large group, and we're told that they would be able to accommodate us. When we arrived, it took some time to set the table, but we were seated in about 15 minutes. 

Everyone sat down, pursued the menu and our waitress took our drink orders. After returning with our drinks, she took our food orders. This is where the trouble begins. 

We are still here, 1.5 hours AFTER we placed our food orders, and still NO food for the majority of our party. Several other tables that were seated had after us have already received their orders.  The food that was delivered to the table after 1.5 hours was luke warm at best.  

A member of our party finally asked for the manager and we were told the kitchen \"forgot\" our order.  To which I ask, how does the kitchen \"forget\" a 20 person order?  I understand that the food takes a while to cook, especially for a large group, but 1.5 hours is completely ridiculous. 

We all were very excited to try this restaurant as it came highly recommended by someone in our party, but we will not be returning to this restaurant due to this incident."}
{"text":"After having gone to multiple locations (including this one last night) I've come to the conclusion that Oregano's rates nothing more than a really big meh.

I ordered two small pizzas and a salad last night and I came to just shy of $40.  Salad was good and the pizzas were way to salty (and I like salt).

I don't think they'll miss me as a customer since just about everyone of these I've ever been to has been packed (regardless of the time) but for the life of me,  I can't figure out how or why people keep coming...its just not that good."}
{"text":"Apparently, the list of things I don't seem to get continues to grow longer.

I ended up here for a group event...16 folks at 5 PM.  Put name on list and the wait started. At 5:45 PM hostess came out and asked us if we'd take a back to back table that should be ready in 20 minutes or so.  The other option was to wait for a larger outside table but it wouldn't be ready until 6:50 PM or so.  Yeah right I think I'll take what's behind door number 1.

20 minutes comes and goes...no table.  6:30 PM comes...they seat a table of 18, that arrived after us at an outside table.  WTF??!!!

6:55 PM they seat us at the back to back table.  WTF???!!!!

Ok so I waited for close to 2 hours to be seated.  Let me get right to the point...the food here isn't worth a 2 hour wait.  Its not worth a 1 hour wait.    Its not worth a 1/2 hour wait.

A word about the pesto.  Unscrew the top off a salt shaker and dump the contents in your mouth.  Same flavor as the pesto...albeit no basil.

NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Another case of \"I just don't get it.\"  Also, another case of there isn't a 2.5, so it's not really a 3 nor is it a 2.

I've been to at least three different locations...not bad, just not worth the wait or the hype.

For a multitude of reasons I can't always have tomato sauce on my pizza so I'm limited \"white\" or pesto pizza.  They don't have a white pizza, so I'm left with pesto.  In short, the pesto is too salty.

As for everything else I've had (salads, sandwiches)...ok.  However, and heres the thing I don't get...what's up with the waffle fries?  Waaaayyyy too heavy.  How about just fries?

So in summary, not bad, just not great.  And here's they key if there's a wait (like any time after 5:45) It's just not worth it.  Why wait for 30+ minutes to have slightly better than middle of the road food?  Again, maybe I just don't get it."}
{"text":"I call it Chicago deep dish pizza.. They call it Chicago stuffed pizza. Either way it is the closest to the Windy City pizzas I love found in the Valley of the Sun. They have gotten a little more expensive, since I first started enjoying this pizza a decade ago. 
I either go with the Numero-Uno (a reference to the famous pizza at Unos and Dues found downtown Chicago)  the spicy chicken stuffed pizza has also been delicious when in the mood for variety.
This is still a wonderful destination for tourists, locals and anyone craving a delicious, stomach filling meal."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews brought me to eat lunch here.   Food was pretty good and a good value.  Pan pizza was disappointing if your expecting a true Chicago pizza.   Lots of sauce that lacked flavor and crust was pretty average.   Fun theme but we all felt it was a bit overdone.    You'll feel like your at a Disney park.  If your looking for Average Italian meal, huge portion at great prices it's a perfect choice.   Small kids would love it!"}
{"text":"Oreganos! Let's be honest, anything less than 5 stars is an outright lie! I make a visit to this location maybe once a month or so and love every minute of the visit. My only \"complaint\" is no reflection on the establishment itself, just the parents in need of a refresher course on how to raise their children; unruly or running around the patio as if this was a playground, but again, this is on the parents...not Oreganos.

I'm not one to try new menu items, I tend to play it safe, but I recently transitioned from the Bollo Pasta to the Rigatoni and OMG! To DIE FOR! Dylan is a great server! We look forward to seeming him each time we visit!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Our server, Christine, was nice and attentive, especially to our 4 yr old. Our wings took a long time to come out and voluntarily, the manager came out and apologized and comp'd our wings. Nice gesture instead of waiting for us to get mad before they did anything."}
{"text":"Picasso salad= great flavor, spicy

Thin crust pepperoni pizza= good, but cheese was a bit too salty

Red pepper lasagna= probably wouldn't order again due to red pepper pasta taste, just not my thing

Turkey sandwich= okay, but too much cheese."}
{"text":"This was probably our best experience to date at this Oregano's Pizza. Our waitress Kiana really was fantastic, she loves her job.... and it SHOWS!
The salad was huge (wish they had a smaller size) and the pizza was served hot and fresh!
The overall experience was great, and did I mention Kiana rocks!"}
{"text":"Oregano's was able to seat our party of six with no wait on a Sunday after church.  That makes it A-ok in my book.  I hadn't eaten breakfast and at 12:30, I was pretty famished.  

I ordered the hot wings.  EEEEEE-gads!  Those things were spicy!  I had ordered wings from Oregano's before, but I must have ordered the Medium wings because I don't remember them having chunks of chili peppers all over them like these did.  They were pretty good in an uncomfortable sort of way.  :)

The service was adequate, but I would not call it friendly service.  

The pizza got rave reviews by all the adults who tried it.  
The garlic bread was pretty tasty.  
The kiddo's meal of cheese pizza was not well-received.  She thought it was terrible and ignored it in favor of the garlic bread.  I didn't try it, but it looked like ultra thin crust with extra greasy cheese on it.  In other words, kids should love it.  Of course, my kiddo tried the Margherita pizza at Pizzeria Bianco (which I was prepared for her to hate) and she called it \"the best pizza ever.\"  Yes, I am raising a little foodie.

Oregano's is a really good alternative to other chains.  I eat there about once every year or so.  It is not really a destination restaurant, but the food is good and not having to wait to eat on a Sunday afternoon is priceless."}
{"text":"Great service, great selection, and amazing service. I saw the reviews and wanted to try it. I was not disappointed! Highly recommend the BBQ Chicken Pizza. It's like CPK's but substantially better. If you're graduating from ASU like I did, then stop in here before you go :-)"}
{"text":"Was checking through Yelp as to what time the restaurant closed and noticed that it listed a wait time and gave me an option to use \"Nowait wait list\" so I tried it and was impressed  that we did not have to wait as we arrived.

Started off as we sat down by ordering the 12\" stuffed pizza with Sausage and Pepperoni as was told it would take 45 to 50 minutes.

Also ordered Pene Pasta which came with a good slice of Italian Bread.

Finally ordered deep fried zucchini. 

After reading the Azcentral review that listed as one of the best deep dish or stuffed pizza and oregano was listed, had to try it. Was totally in disagreement to this stuffed pizza being top five. Pizza was very wet and soggy and on top of that did not taste very much if any sausage or pepperoni. The outer crust was not bad but it was just too soggy with alot of tomato sauce and cheese which is not a good combination for my stomach. 

The pasta was ordered with butter and that is what we got because my daughter had her 4 wisdom teeth removed 5 days prior. The deep fried zucchini was also not the best I have had and borderlined being frozen not fresh tasting. 

Overall was very disappointed and l would not recommended the stuffed pizza as azcentral did"}
{"text":"The food was very good however the wait time and service was lacking. Oh yes, they need to add a bit more sauce with their dishes, a few of their dishes were a bit dry. I asked for more honey mustard dressing for my salad and I was charged $.75 for a plastic cup. Waiting more than 15 minutes for a meal was inexcusable."}
{"text":"Customer service on point as usual! If you go, try to get one of Anna's table! My favorite food is Alfredo the Dark with chicken and EXTRA sauce. She was the first server to get me the amount of extra sauce I like!"}
{"text":"after a long day of laying out by the pool, napping, and drinking - we were on vacation, damn it - oregano's was exactly the kind of place what we were looking for.  casual.  fun.  outdoor seating on a warm evening.  mellow but not dead, crowded but not overwhelming.  

perfect.

though the food was great - huge, tasty portions - the service just outshone everything.  pierre (the manager?) is super friendly, and mikey, the hostess, is just about the sweetest person ever.  she went out of her way to accomodate us, chatted it up with us, and recommended us some of her favorite places to go out at in scottsdale.  above and beyond service like this just takes the overall dining experience to a whole new level.

oh and the baseball player sightings *ahem, barry zito, ahem* don't hurt, either :)"}
{"text":"I love the menu items..especially the Fettuccine Alfredo! The waiters are very social and the atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"The food was great! But I was a bit confused and disappointed when we tried to order a regular crust pizza and we were told it would be 45 min to an hour. So he suggested we order the thin crust as it was only 25 min."}
{"text":"Better pizza can be had at other places, but where else can you get the Pizza Cookie!  (One of my top 10 all-time favorite desserts) Oregano's also has good meal-sized salads.  Parking isn't as bad as people make it sound.  So what if you can't park right in their tiny lot.  There is plenty of parking on the street within walking distance."}
{"text":"The servers are just fabulous.
The pizza is very tasty and cooked to perfection over all a great place to eat."}
{"text":"You can always count of Oreganos for good, food and loud jazz music!
  We lived in Sedona for 14 years so the Fkagstaff location was the one we would visit when we were up there for some Kickbutt Garlic Bread. and some Boom Dip. Add a side of giant meatballs and both of us had a meal   
  We noticed at this location that the giant meatballs were not so giant anymore, we had to order 2 in order to fill up for a day of shopping.  Maybe that holds true for all of them - a way to not have to raise the price.  Still a good deal and they are delish
  Their salads are still huge and the original pizza cookie is ridiculous!!!!!
  Service is always attentive and my puppy loves getting a fortune cookie when we get home."}
{"text":"I drove by this place many times and figured I would finally give it a try.

For main entrée, we ordered a pizza and a traditional spaghetti with meatballs. Portion is generous. The garlic bread that came with the spaghetti was tasty. Service was good and the general seating areas are clean and organized. I'll definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Thin crust pizza is thin all the way around. Not much bang for the buck. Purchased the extra large cheese and a medium mushroom. The mushroom pizza had a nice flavor if you could ignore the saltiness. The cheese just wasn't enough food for the size and the price. There must be something else here that makes this such a popular chain."}
{"text":"So very upset. I have used this for this location twice and they 'didn't get my check in' and I show them on here and they won't honor it knowing and seeing it is the correct location and everything. 
Then to top it off have to send my food back multiple time. Very upset with this service. After I leave tonight this is the last time I will ever use this location."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food! 1 star for the service. We came here on a Tuesday night for a birthday party. We waited an hour and a half to be seated (a bit long but acceptable considering there were 10 of us) only to end up at three different booths that weren't even in the same section. This place has good food but it's not worth the hassle and wait you have to go through. We will order take out but we wont dine in anymore..."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly even on a weekend night. The staff were friendly and attentive and the majority of whom were females wearing somewhat provocative white shirts bearing slogans such as \"legalize marinara\" and \"tastes like garlic.\" It kind of reminded me of the Italian food version of Hooters. 

Food and drinks arrived quickly and were good. Prices are a bit high for pizza and pasta, but the atmosphere made it enjoyable. They have a good selection of menu items which gives you lots of options. For dessert they have a pizza cookie topped with ice cream which is one of my favorites and reason enough to come here."}
{"text":"We came July 1st. It was hot out but not over 100 degrees so the management wouldn't put the misters on because \"it wasn't hot enough\" it was at least 95 degrees. But since it wasn't over 100 the said there could be an issue with \"someone slipping\". Why not put some signs out warning they could slip? I feel bad for the servers who have to serve all night in this heat with no relief."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Perfect amount of spices and it def was filling. The service was great as well and I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"The BEST Italian in town.  The decor is adorable, fun and can keep you occupied for hours just looking around!  The food takes a while because they make it to order, but IT IS AMAZING!  I LOVE their guacamole appetizer and all of their entrees are wonderful!  Belinis will change your life!  YUM!"}
{"text":"We dined for dinner recently. Orders were taken promptly. Drinks were slow to get refilled. My entrée was advertised as \"huge\" but in actuality was just normally sized. The prices were decent, and the food tasted good. We will return again."}
{"text":"Mmm, lovely salads and sandwiches - I've been to other locations, but this was my first time here. My favorite sandwich used to be the veggie wedgie, but over the years the franchise has changed the bread, now it's too hard for me - so this time, I ordered the Pablo Picasso Mexican salad. Very yummy! But also incredibly massive! Luckily I was hungry. Also, we ordered the fried zucchini - OMG, this was amazing!! Deliciousness!! I definitely recommend. 
Oregano's is always busy, though, and also is on the cluttered side, just the general design and atmosphere. I don't mind it too much, but if you are planning to go, plan ahead - this location is across from a theater and near a mall, so you may find yourself facing a line and a considerable wait time. We only had to sit fifteen minutes, but we also went earlier."}
{"text":"Dig into the suffed pizza is the reason why we come here and they always have fun and professional servers. We've been going to the various locations ever since we started going to spring training back in 2002 and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Like all Oregano's restaurants (I think I've been to all of the ones in AZ), I think the food is A-OK.  I have my favorites (pasta and golden wings) and my least favorite (all of their pizzas are pretty bad...wannabe fancy but quite can't make it).  I don't particularly like sitting inside because it is loud.  And I appreciate the clean-cut, very friendly staff.  So I gave the 4th stars because:
1) My husband looooooves Oregano's portions.  Yes, \"typical American\" portions.  You could feed a whole third-world village with one of their plates.  So the 4th star goes for my husband who doesn't Yelp.  Yes, I know, how can I be with him?
2) PATIO.  Living in a state with the most awesome Fall/Winter weather in the world, I often wonder why more restaurants don't have appealing patios.  I come from the land of \"terrazas\", which means that all bars and restaurants put tables and chairs practically on the street to attract patrons.  And they are always full.  I love sitting outside, and with some well-placed misters you can extend the life of a patio for a couple more months.  Yet in Chandler I don't find many, sadly.  Patio sitting is also the perfect solution for those of us that have children, I don't know, it makes dining with them more relaxing.  And Oregano's patios rock.  This particular location has a huge one with a giant fireplace and firepits."}
{"text":"I love love the food but after we were seated, it took 15 minutes to get someone to serve us after I went up and asked if we had a server. Notnsiormer vusy and has some empty tables maybe short staffed but with a hungry kid 15 minutes waiting for water and a chance to order is way too long."}
{"text":"Oregano's is a very suitable upgrade to Olive Garden. Having branched out and tried even more Italian places I still feel confident that this is a \"pretty good\" Italian joint, not super authentic but good. The pasta sauces are pretty bland, though my wife and I always get a Pablo Picasso Salad (Very Big serving) to share and then something else to share. 

Their pizzas are pretty good. I love the Carne Asada Street Pizza, very fun fusion pizza. 

It is a bit of a long wait during dinner rush and weekends, but we are in and out in about an hour before 7 on weekdays. Good value for the food as well."}
{"text":"What a wonderful Chicago style place for pizza and garlic bread and meatball sandwiches and I could just go on and on! Renee was just fantastic withthe service recommendations and even gave us drinks to go l. Ozzie and Harriet on the tv was great!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first visit.  It started out a little sketchy.  They were busy and our service started out a little slow.  However, by divine intervention they had a shift change and Marcus became our server.  He was great.  Our service was first class and then some.  Marcus and the whole crew were on top of it.  
Our food and drinks were delivered with a song. (Literally) I can admit my soft drink refills (Diet Pepsi) may have bordered on excessive, but Marcus's response was...\"You keep knocking em down I'll keep setting em up.\" ...and he did. 
The portions were huge.  We took boxes of extra food home.  The food was very good and the prices were very reasonable.  This was everybody in my groups first visit and we will be back.  
Even though they were busy everything turned out great.  
The staff made suggestions that were spot on.  
Definitely, this is place is worth a try. 
BTW-they have Calzones that were not on the regular menu. My cousin thought his was very good.  We all took bites of it and he was right.  The pizza cookies were sinful."}
{"text":"Decent pizza.  Needed more sauce.  Great wings, great meatballs, great drinks, great dessert.  We might have indulged a bit that night."}
{"text":"Worst service experience in awhile. I usually love Oreganos, but I won't be visiting this location again. The hostess wasn't there when we arrived and after standing awkwardly at the hostess station for over 5 minutes, the hostess came and asked us if \"we were ready to be seated\"!? No apologies.\"Yes, we're ready.\" Then the bartender couldn't make the drink I wanted because he would have had to go to the kitchen to get jalapeños. 
I ordered the stuffed Riga Tony . It came with almost no sauce. I asked the waitress for more sauce  and she came back with it about 10 minutes later. I also requested a Diet Pepsi which never did make it. Dinner's not over yet, but I'm totally over it."}
