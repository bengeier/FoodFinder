{"text":"Our hotel mistakenly sent us here but we were vegetarians. Don't go here if you're a vegetarian. They were accommodating however over charged us for veggies and chips."}
{"text":"Best food in town..always great service. .I definitely recommend to all..try the pork shank..or the Carne asada. .the hoppers poppers are perfect.."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place for a while and finally did today for lunch. The mahi mahi tacos were really good with a great portion of fish for the taco size. My husband got a pasta dish that was also very good.  When I think of Mexican food, I always assume there will be chips and salsa served. I understand lots of places charge for them, but I'm always disappointed when they do so. But, nice staff all around and quick service."}
{"text":"The food is good, the wine is good, the drinks are good. What is the problem? The servers, especially the two male bartenders! The have NO PEOPLE SKILLS!  The female bartender was great, once she came on shift!  If they improved on this, we'd give them a 5."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for dinner.  I had been here once before when it first opened and had not been back since.  What a great menu, so many pork choices that I was overwhelmed and trying to hide my drool.  I asked the waitress to help me choose which pork dish would satisfy my carnivorous craving and she pointed me to the tenderloin.  I have to admit at first the description with chocolate espresso rub and vanilla bean butter sauce sounded a bit too fussy for me but she did not steer me wrong.  It was very good and I like that they do not give you too much food, well portioned.  Including some dishes offer a full or half-size order.  We topped of our wonderful conversation with some chocolate dessert, Mexican Chocolate Torte.  I loved it.  My friend ate the ice cream being that I don't eat dairy and she said it was good."}
{"text":"The setting was nicely lit with a nice mix of mood lighting and candle light to set the evening into motion. The epicurean delight then started with bacon stuffed jalapeños that were delicious enough to convert any vegetarian to being a a purveyor of the fat back. Next came entrees of carne asada, short ribs with a hint of green chilie to remind you what defines great Mexican food. For the Pesci lovers the special of the evening u had to sample just for the Halibut! To finish of the explosions that were detonating in my mouth, I had to gently settle down my taste buds with carmel glazed bread pudding that hit my sugar meter and finished me off as I slipped into my food coma.... a great treat for all ages! All that was left is for me to leave was just the tip!"}
{"text":"Carne asada with excellent flavor and meaty, not tough or chewy like some places.  Stacked enchiladas great and extremely filling.  Flavors dance in your mouth! Ask for extra pico de gallo, it is awesome. Divine meal in a casual friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is one our favorite restaurants in the valley. The food is always fresh and every dish we've tried has been delicious. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is courteous. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Perhaps the problem was it was New Year's Day.  But our experience was not a good - and I likely wouldn't go back to try again!   First - the service -- slow - inattentive and at times just missing.   Second - the food.  Start with the chips.  $9 for some guacamole and chips?  The dip and salsa were good but 25 chips?  Come on!!  You ask why didn't I request more:   I WOULD have done if our server ever returned!    The entree I had was fish, clams and mussels.  OK -- but someone dropped the red pepper in there!  I LOVE hot food -- but this hot in a fish dish?  The other two entrees were OK -- not exceptional.  The waitress came by fleetingly just after the food arrived and asked if all was well.  As we hadn't even taken a bite, there was not much to say.  But she didn't come back until the entrees were finished.  She then refilled my drink which had been empty for 10 minutes.    Then we were asked would you like to see the desert menu --to which I replied \"yes please\"  It was delivered in 5 minutes - but it was at LEAST another 10 minutes before she returned to take our orders.  At that point, I just wanted to leave!  So marginal food and poor service.  Either one I might have given it a second chance - but with both of those in one meal - and so many other good places to spend $110 for dinner for three (no wine) -- I think not!"}
{"text":"Tucked away on the corner of Glendale and 7th St, the restaurant is a great little find in the neighborhood. The dining area is intimate and is southwest themed, with a rustic wood ceiling and cowboy pictures/artwork throughout. A patio is available as well. For dinner we ordered the mini quesadillas as the appetizer and they were quite tasty. The salmon was very good and the chicken pasta was well presented and appropriately spiced. All in all, it was a very nice dining experience. I look forward to trying the southwest breakfast menu sometime. The poblano eggs benedict sounds intriguing. Sierra Bonita should definitely be placed on a \"must try it out\" list for people looking for a new dining spot."}
{"text":"I eat here once or twice a month. Never been disappointed by the food or the service. The place is on the smaller side and more intimate than most restaurants.   Appetizers I have had and recommend:  Stuffed Jalapenos  Enchiladas Verde-I typically eat this as an entree   Lighter fare:  Burgers are good  Cowboy stew was good and comforting   Main Meals  Buttermilk Chicken with sweet potato mash-excellent  Red Chili over rice and beans-nice  Central Chicken was very nice   Desserts  Buttermilk pie-worth going for by itself  Bread Pudding-Best in the Valley hands down  Chocolate Souffle-nicely done, has a little chili in it for a nice kick   Service:  Typically all have been excellent  Kelton is the perfect mix of friendly but not overpowering   The place is very casual and friendly in feel. Someplace you can drop in for a nice meal and not break the bank. Better food that the Roaring Fork at a fraction of the price and much friendlier."}
{"text":"I felt like I was missing something here.  Perhaps as a vegetarian, though one who eats seafood occasionally, I didn't find enough on the menu that I could eat.  The salad with strawberries and blue cheese was fine, but I could get something like that anywhere. The margarita was passable, nothing special.  The corn tamale was the highlight of my meal -- I wanted the chilaquiles, but for some reason they couldn't be made without meat (sounds like the sauce was premade in a big vat that morning).  If I'd ordered about three of the tamales I might have given Sierra Bonita 4 stars. I might still have gone with 4 stars because my waitress was excellent, but when the buttermilk pie, which is incredibly sugary and rich so split it two or three ways, came out and one of the raspberries used as garnish was moldy...yuck.  I walked out of this place thinking 2 stars, but on reflection am giving it three for the tamale and the good service."}
{"text":"This was my first visit but not my last. I had the jalapeño poppers and the buttermilk chicken. Both were delicious. I have marked this location as a definite return."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place for lunch and dinner.  Never disappointed.  Parking can be a bit of a problem.  The menu is varied and interesting.  Not your standard fare. Tried happy hour there with the guys, and the value wasn't there.  However, lunch and dinner are always a pleasure.  Service is consistently excellent and friendly.  If you like Southwestern flair dining, we understand why it is so popular."}
{"text":"Always great to find a place that serves a great Green Chile Cheeseburger!   Service was also great, only thing not great about the experience was that the chairs in the dining area were slightly uncomfortable by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I love their regular menu, but their Sunday Brunch is the reason I head to Sierra Bonita. My favorite is the Buttermilk Chicken if its a regular night. If you go for brunch, please try the Atole Pinon Hotcakes. You will not be disappointed. They have a great sweetness without being overpowering. Perfect!"}
{"text":"You've gotta love any place that puts margaritas on happy hour!  $6 drinks and appetizers - guacamole and tacos were what I expected.  Drinks were mixed well.  Cute, southwestern decor with a modern twist.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Have been back a few times since this post and this restaurant is still one of my faves...I got to experience their brunch menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago...and...wow! My veggie omelette was delicious as was my boyfriend's meal-the breakfast enchiladas..we split a glass of wine because I believe brunch isn't brunch without a little alchohol and it was a generous pour/split...keep doin' yo thing Sierra Bonita!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant. We have always loved the food and ambiance.   I recently gave a baby shower here and they helped me to make it a great success!  We were given a private room with a great table setting.  We had an extra table for all the gifts.  The food was delicious, the service was excellent.  Everyone had a wonder time.  I cannot thank the staff enough!  I know this event will be remembered for a long time by all who attended.  Thank you!  When you eat dinner here, don't miss the bread pudding.  It is \"to die for!\""}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever been here. I went because I was given a gift certificate. We went for dinner. Expensive. Quality. Upscale but very casual dress.  Large wine selection. Bring your wallets.   Dinner - I ordered Pork Osso Busco - $25.00. It was served on cheddar mashed potatoes with well flavored zuccini, squash, carrots, and cooked vidalia onions, and a southwestern spicy green sauce all over it. My dinner was large, and the food was fantastic. The meals here have a southwestern flair and are upscale.   My husband ordered Carne Asada Quesadillas served with rice & beans $23. He thought it was very good. The portion size was average.   We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer. It was $14.00. You only get 4 shrimp. Although very tasty, far overpriced for 4 shrimp.   All salads & soups are extra money. A dinner salad, alone, is $7.00. Dinner prices are $18 (the lowest) - $25. Average price is $23. Again, soup & salads aren't included in any meal.   The ambiance was nice. Very appealing. Casual. I thought it was loud. It was busy.   Sandwiches are roughly $15. I noticed most people in the restaurant ordered sandwiches. Definitely cheaper than dinner.    The food very good. My portion size was large. My husband's very average. The 4 shrimp very good, but way overpriced for $14. Most of the appetizers were around $9. The food here is unique, flavorful, upscale, but you are also paying more $$. We ordered the chocolate multan lava cake. $9. Good, but very small.   I didn't have to pay for anything, since someone gave me a gift certificate. Personally, I couldn't afford $25 dinners, $14 appetizers, $7 salads......  If you don't care about the cost, it's a very quality place for food & ambiance.   They have a good happy hour in the bar, only. a variety of $6 unique appetizers. $3 bottled beer, $6 wine.   Nice restaurant for a romantic date, or go during happy hour for quality appetizer for $6. Happy hour is in the bar, only."}
{"text":"So happy this place is in the hood.   We have been regulars for brunch, lunch, dinner or cocktails since the place opened and enjoy how they are always trying to get better.  The relatively recent menu change is a good example.  Great Arizona ambiance!  Enjoy the dining room, the \"patio\" area or sit at one of the many tables in the bar and let Miguel, Kenny, Thomas, Mike or Emily serve you a margarita.  And don't translate \"margarita\" into a standard Mexican food restaurant - that is NOT what you will find at Sierra Bonita.  They serve great and unique southwestern fare."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food. Long story short I've worked in many fine dining restaurants where the fresh ingredients, plate preperation, and perfect mix of flavors are required. This place is clearly competition with the best of the best. Even after working at many 5 star restaurants with 4 'dollar bills' I was amazed at this menu and food. Service was fantastic, prices clearly affordable and the plates obviously took much time and thought into creating well balanced taste and beautiful presentation. Though it should go without saying, I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for some southwestern food with a different flare. A little expensive, but we had good service and our dishes were delicious. Celebrated Fathers Day for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a landmark place in Phoenix.  Have been many times, and mentioned to one of the wait staff how much we always enjoy the place.  She brought one of the owners, Nate, over and I had a lovely chat with him. His professionalism carries over to his employees.  The food/service/ambiance were EXCELLENT, as always!"}
{"text":"As native Arizonans, we often prefer hole-in-wall Mexican restaurants with great authentic food.  That said, we also enjoy a variety of other cuisines, gourmet restaurants and many things in between.  This was a very good blend of the many things we enjoy.  The green chili was great, as was the sangria.  The prime rib sandwich special with sautéed onions was excellent and filling.  I shared part of it with my husband.  The bread/bun for the sandwich tasted home baked by a real pro.  Skinny fries were crisp and not greasy.  My husband's Southwestern Cobb salad with Poblano Ranch dressing was very fresh and included avocado, carne asada, bacon, spinach, and assorted greens....among other treats. It was served with the biscuit of the day which was a green chili biscuit.  The salad was so large that I finished my meal before he did......a 25 year first.  I glanced at the dessert menu (just so I could tell you what they had, of course) but could not pass up the Buttermilk Pie with caramel sauce.  It was wonderful unless you are a supertaster who dislikes anything too sweet.  They had several other goodies including Bread pudding and Gelato Trio.  The green chili pasta was good, but not quite as good as The Roaring Fork had the last time I was there.  Charming fellow was our server in the \"patio.\"  This was a great idea in hot or cold climates.  It is fully enclosed and air conditioned, but has the feel of an old, Mexican outside ramada.  Everyone should try Sierra Bonita Grill at least once."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a good dinner last evening; the salmon was superb, our meal was served hot and the mixture of spices and Southwest fusion was interesting. This is a well run restaurant and attention to detail above reproach.  Nicely done!!!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch at SBG yesterday.    Having been almost a year since I've dined there.  This place seems to have lost all of the style it once had.  The service was second-rate despite the dining area not being busy at all.    The menu has changed drastically.  Instead of taking the time to explain changes and offer suggestions for the new menu and allowing us a few moments to adjust to the menu changes our waitress seemed to want to rush us into an order.  After taking our order our waitress brought our drinks: ( a room temperature cup of coffee for my companion and  a glass of iced tea for me).  Neither of which would ever be refilled.  The mediocre food was dropped off at the table by a bus boy and no one ever bothered to ask how it was.    The yummy Enchiladas Suizas (Chicken Enchiladas in Tomatillo-Cream Sauce) that  was my favorite item on the old menu are no longer on the new menu -- and most  of what is on the new menu are unoriginal and uninspiring dishes that are easy to find,  at better prices, at many nearby restaurants.   If you think that serving $9 chips-and-salsa or offering a side of beans with a mediocre burger or turkey sandwich is clever southwestern cuisine this place is probably going to impress you -- if you are seeking a stronger and truer version of authentic southwestern style of cooking you'll need to go someplace else."}
{"text":"I will not be returning to this restaurant due to atrocious customer service by Nate, the Owner/manager.   My family and I went to this restaurant as part of a celebration of my husband's birthday.  The reason we selected this location was due to gift certificate for $25 which we had purchased through restaurant.com.  We thought that we would try it out.  The certificate was valid until the end of August and we were there on August 13.  It was late afternoon and few people were there.  The service was lackluster at best and the food mediocre, in particular the meat was not cooked as specified.  When it came time to pay, we presented the certificate and the server left.  He returned and said that due to a disagreement with restaurant.com, they would not accept it.  Not wanting to make a scene and surprised that the manager did not relay the information (after spending over $80), we paid the bill and left.  When I got home I called and asked to speak to the manager.  Nate who identified himself as the owner answered and was very rude and discourteous - he never once offered to make any amends and just kept repeating that he had a disagreement with restaurant.com and had stopped accepting these although there was no signage to that effect.  He said that he had purchased the business in December and I pointed out that he bought it with these coupon commitments attached.  He has no clue about customer service.  Also, there was no sign posted warning that restaurant.com certificates were no longer being accepted."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to go, either for a special date night or a nice lunch with a special friend. My suggested appetizer is the chips and salsa that also comes with a really good guacamole. The salads are phenomenal and pretty much everything is equally great. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mediocre - best thing that happened to them was Richardson's fire, perhaps they can get over flow from Dick's while Rich Brown rebuilds.   The place is decent inside, has a patio where you can't smoke and a bar and more parking than you would think given the awkward lot it was shoehorned into. My issues are food and service. Food is average & inconsistent and service is typically light on attention to detail. God forbid you go in for a late dinner. They bang stuff around, move chairs and stare while you are trying to finish. If you f8ckers want to close at 8, do it, but change the sign on the door and stop taking orders at 7."}
{"text":"I give this place a 5 star, because of the service... and the Fresh squeezed Margarita...OMG, the best.  Our waiter, all I remember that he was Black and puerto rican... funny, gives excellent service, friendly...   We ordered soups, and the fresh bread sandwich...and all of it was delish... price was okay . but nothing like Fuego del Mar...(don't go there).    I'm going back for sure... my family and I agree this was a great place to visit."}
{"text":"We selected this place for a Saturday evening after reading other reviews. It was a terrific event. Parking could be a little tight, but an employee (with flashlight) was there to assist. We had some Mojitos (not bad, but not the best ever). The food was fabulous. We narrowed down an appetizer to three possibilities. Our attentive waiter recommended the guacamole. Good choice! We ordered the buttermilk chicken and carne asada, so I got to sample a little of both. I couldn't tell you which one was better. If I lived in Phoenix, I'd be a regular at this place."}
{"text":"I've had consistently good stuff here. Frankly, I usually shun \"Mexican\" places that are anything but traditional, and consider \"southwestern\" style as death knell for my tastebuds... but Sierra Bonita has overcome all that. Items I really like are the guacamole (very chunky avocado), fish tacos, bacon wrapped beef (they had achieved the elusive goal of getting the bacon crispy without overcooking the shrimp), the pork lion enchiladas (offered sometimes as specials) and burgers. No culinary breakthroughs here, but always pleasing.   My colleague commented that his pork enchiladas were $11, came with no sides, and still left him hungry. While I think prices are reasonable for the quality, those with a large appetite may be looking at $15.00 or more for a meal."}
{"text":"The place is casual, very clean and awesome food.  A lot of dishes with green chili on the menu"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here with friends on a Saturday night.  I was in town for a chiropractic conference and went to this restaurant with about eight of my friends for dinner one Saturday night. It's always a bonus in my experience when you can get a good-sized table and have great service. The other good thing about this group of friends as they tend to share what they ordered off the menu, so we all get to get a taste of various meals.  Jalapenos that we got during appetizers were amazing, and I was quite happy with the margaritas I got served. Meat was spectacular and everything I tasted off of other's plates was worthy of a return trip.  Parking wasn't an issue, staff was exceptionally friendly and attentive to our table, and the general manager stopped by to check on us and make sure we were having a great evening, which indeed we were.  I'm looking forward to in other conference nearby just so we can eat there again."}
{"text":"I love that my friend suggested this place because it was a great find! I came for happy hour and we shared some of the small plates. We got the corn, the red Chile mac and cheese, and the carne asada tacos. all of the dishes we delicious...my favorite was the red Chile mac and cheese...so freaking good!!!!! The restaurant had a great feel and would be perfect for dates:) The bartenders we awesome very nice and attentive! The only reason I gave it four star was the price....we paid 6 dollars for a ear of corn with cheese on it!!! at happy hour too!!! I admit we should have never ordered it but after a glass of wine I forgot to check for prices!!! The bread pudding here is so mouth- watering good....a must if you come here!"}
{"text":"The Sierra Bonita salad was really good but their Bloody Mary was quite possibly the dullest and flavorless I've ever had :/   Service was good. Nice lunch atmosphere. Over priced a tad.   Otro Cafe is better."}
{"text":"Passed by the Grill many times but had never eaten there until buying an online coupon.  Since I had a large amount on the coupon and no friends available, I was able to taste a few items for takeout.  The SB salad with chicken was excellent with all the right assortment of greens, onions, fruit in season and grilled chicken.  I did not get a dressing because I forgot to order it and they didn't ask.  My only ding on the food except perhaps for the pecans in the salad didn't quite \"go\".  Had wanted to try the prickly pear dressing but that will have to wait.  The North Central Chicken was excellent.  Perfectly seasoned and cooked and the corn was out of this world as well as the potatoes and asparagus.    Beef Tenderloin was tender and so flavorful that I started eating it after eating the chicken dinner.  The onion and potatoes were also delicious.  The icing on the cake for me was the bread pudding.  I've tried many others where available and nobody has come close to White Chocolate Grill's in my opinion.  This is on-par with theirs.  Delicious."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in town!!!!!.never a bad meal.the poppers are awesome.the buttermilk chicken never disappoints. I would highly recommend you try everything."}
{"text":"Excellent appetizers, main courses, atmosphere, lighting, music, service, drinks, desserts and coffee. One of my favorite restaurants overall! Thanks Sierra Bonita!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal. Just this week had the halibut ceviche special and as always the best guacamole (especially if you like garlic). The green chile stew was good, although I would have liked a bit more kick. Dined in the patio for the first time and it was great atmosphere. However it was a bit humid. Still a great experience."}
{"text":"There ain't much for vegetarians here. Fortunately I eat fish, but if didn't, I suppose I could have had... what, a salad? Of course I can get a salad anywhere, so that ain't sayin' much. The food was pretty good, nothing mind-blowing but not bad by any means. My group snacked on a variety of appetizers - ahi tacos, carne tacos and quesadillas. Ahi tacos were pretty tasty, and contained quite the generous helping of ahi. About the size of a chicken breast, actually. Quite impressive. I don't eat meat, so I didn't try the carne tacos, but my friends said they were pretty good. And the quesadillas, well, they were pretty good too, but not enough cheese to qualify as quesadillas in my opinion. My biggest problem with this place, aside from from the lackluster service, was the lack of veggie options. I mean, come on people, almost every other Mexican restaurant in the  valley at least has mushroom or spinach enchiladas on the menu. Would it kill you to put something on a plate you didn't have to kill? Not judging, just saying.."}
{"text":"I've been to Sierra Bonita a couple times in the past, but most recently last week for lunch. My bro & dad go here once a week for lunch & I happened to join them on their weekly visit. They both ordered the smoked turkey club sandwich, 1 with a side of beans & 1 with a side of asparagus. I opted for the buttermilk chicken which comes with sides of mashed chipotle sweet potatoes & asparagus. My dad & bro enjoyed their sandwiches & all was devoured. My chicken & sides were very tasty & at a smaller lunch portion I almost cleaned my plate. I can't comment on the total since I didn't foot the bill, but I believe it was under $50, including drinks but not including tip."}
{"text":"...ok this is a continuation of my search for a decent HH after being sorely disappointed in Dicks Hideaway. The HH iat Sierra Bonita fit the bill perfectly ...my husband and I decided to give Kenny's \"special\" margarita a try. Good Lord...that was a GREAT drink and only $6.00 in a big glass. All of their specialty margaritas are $6.00 along with $2.00 domestic bottles... specials on draft and well drink and they have a couple of wines on special as well. All of their appetizers are 1/2 price and you can easily make a meal out of them. Kenny and Miguel are great bartenders and the bar is full of regulars that they know by first name. If you decide to stick around for dinner their fish specials are alway a favorite of mine and my husband loves their carne asada. Nate the owner was busy smoking a brisket outside that smelled divine and will be todays lunch special.....mmmmm......we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Set aside my three star rating for a moment.   The atmosphere of the Sierra Bonita Grill gets 5 stars in my book!  It's a cute little \"cantina\"-like atmosphere with the dark hardwood throughout.  It's very unassuming.  The service we had on our first visit was outstanding and I have to say we were a challenging group.   The waitress did a great job managing a group of 20 -- all orders came out together, no mistakes, and drinks were filled consistently.  It was all very impressive.  The food was good too, but here's where my disappointment begins.   I ordered a green chile cheeseburger.  The burger was way overcooked and, while I understand the spice of the green chiles is a personal taste, there really was no flavor to the green chiles.  A friend of mine ordered the Carne Asada which was seasoned and grilled to perfection.  And another friend ordered Green Chile Pozole (which I think may be seasonal on the menu) which flavoral - I've never had green chile Pozole so it was a first for me.    I think I'll give this place another try!"}
{"text":"SBG is a great place to have unique food and super Margaritas! We have been going since the first week it was open. I have had two larger parties down stairs. It is very private and they will dedicate servers for your party. Prices are med to expensive, so bring your money if you want to have a blow out! Try the Buttermilk Pie it's to die for!"}
{"text":"One of my long time favorite places to eat in Phoenix. Generous portion size - I love that you can do the half sizes, too! Obsessed with the buttermilk chicken."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! The staff was attentive and the food was delicious. Got the house red wine and tasted like the expensive stuff. Best new restaurant, I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"New happy hour menu is delicious! Lots of new items that only offered from 3-6pm. But you can't get it on the weekends so make sure you find time during your week to check out the new menu!! Beers on tap always changing and always good!! Good job Sierra!"}
{"text":"There were five of us who came for dinner. We were told it was a thirty minute wait for a table, so we decided to wait in the bar area. There were three bartenders working and none of them acknowledged us when we sat at the bar. Fifteen minutes passed and none of them took our drink order. It wasn't until I asked loudly if we could order a drink did a bartender serve us.  A couple minutes after receiving our drinks the hostess came and told us a table was ready and to close out our tab at the bar. We waited a couple minutes for our bar bill, and got nothing. I asked loudly for our bill and all three bartenders ignore me. Me and the group went to the table. If the bar wanted our money they could come to us. Sure enough five minutes later a bartender ran over with our tab. We have a zero dollar tip for the awful bar service.  Our waiter on the other hand was phenomenal. He provided us first class service and was great.  My recommendation for this restaurant: either seriously retrain your bar staff or fire them and start anew. None of them should be in the food service industry they way they currently act."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love Sierra Bonita Grill. Very unassuming restaurant at the Southeast Corner of 7th Street and Glendale Avenue. The food is incredible, with many dishes leaning towards the Southwestern and Mexican influences that are prevalent here in the Phoenix Metro Area. I personally can't live with out the Carne Asada Dinner. The skirt steak is seasoned and cooked to perfection, the traditional beans and rice are wonderful supports, and the fresh tortillas and guacamole make the dish a masterpiece. For appetizers, the spinach and oxaca cheese quesadilla is great, the hand-hacked guacamole and salsa that comes with fresh warm chips is a can't miss, and the margaritas are perfect. Sierra Bonita is owned by the same proprietor as Phoenix City Grill, and is a excellent complement to the Valley scene and the the 7th Street corridor."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! - new to the area and friend took me here for brunch one day. LOVED IT!  OMG the baked beans are delicious! Service was great and love the atmosphere. I'm a pretty picky eater and this is one of my new favourite go to spots!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch this week. We made reservations, which I highly suggest, becuase its so popular and a lot of people frequent it for a business lunch The atmosphere is a cool, Western ranch with wooden booths and high celiings. It does get a little loud but its all on good fun. When I went the host at the front was smoking HOT so that was a major plus. I order the Santa Cruz pasta and it was pretty good. I got the small and I wish I'd gotten the large because frankly the small was small. My co worker ordered the veggie burger and LOVED it and another co worker ordered the southwest ceasar salad and that looked to die for! If I go back I will def get that."}
{"text":"\"Home! Home on the range!\" When I hear that American folk song I usually think of sweating at the stovetop cooking. I'm not so \"at home\" on that range. That's when I gallop over to the Sierra Bonita Grill, the namesake of the historic hacienda. It is the first, largest--and oldest--American cattle ranch in Arizona, (and the nation) near Willcox. Whites, American Indians and Mexicans lived and worked side by side as equals. Billy the Kid worked there as a ranch hand. (It didn't work out.)   The classy and comfy Sierra Bonita Grill pays tribute to the history and hospitality of that venerable ranch 'n' range, offering a uniquely western menu with spicy influences from South of the Border. For 12 years they've been a North Central favorite. \"We're not trendy or 'hipster.' We offer quality food at a good price,\" said owner Nate Hopper. 'Nuff said, pardner! Nate helped create the unique menu after a culinary immersion foray in Oaxaca, southern Mexico.   When the dinner bell rang, we ordered the piquant starter Hopper's Poppers. They serve up a sizzling cast iron platter of broiled, halved, mild jalapeños stuffed with a blend of four cheeses that's a rootin'-tootin' favorite. Eight for $14.  A chuck wagon fave is the Green Chile Mac 'n' Cheese with al dente penne pasta, green chiles, Cheddar and tangy Menonita cheeses all for a sawbuck. (That's $10.)  Sierra Bonita has tweaked their menu for summer, putting away some of the classic cold weather rations--like Cowboy Chili--in the back pantry 'til the next cold snap. You'll have your choice of other summer favorites, like the Pan-Seared Red Trout, presenting a generous, flaky, mild filet (no bones) with a seasoned crust you'll flip over. Mild, without any \"fishiness,\" it's served with green beans, roasted peppers, baby spinach, tomatoes all sautéed in brown butter. There's plenty of vittles and well-worth the $23 price tag.   If you got a cattle driver's appetite, you'll be hankerin' for the Pork Osso Bucco. The Grand Canyon-sized shank is carefully braised and served with green chile mashed potatoes, roasted baby carrots, cipollini onions, zucchini, and doused with Hatch green chile sauce. You'll have plenty to chow down on for just $27.  The Buttermilk Chicken is comfort foo. This is the Number One best-selling item on the menu. Breaded, lightly fried and finished in the oven, it comes with Oaxacan chile mashed sweet potatoes, giving it a \"Thanksgiving\" kick, asparagus and cracked black pepper gravy. Tasty and traditional, sure, but try treating yourself to a few of the other incredible comestibles. $15 lunch/$25 dinner. They purchase locally when possible. All beef served is from Arizona.  Sierra Bonita offers more fine fare: choose from five different salads, or three kinds of soup, including Green Chile Pork Pozole. Six other entrées, lkike Stacked Enchiladas ($16) and Santa Cruz Pasta ($21) are enough to have us set up a wagon train and go back for more. Best of all, you get a full plate of rations that'll fill your belly without emptying your knapsack.    Sierra Bonita's saloon offers more than 19 Arizona wines as well as many Arizona craft beers. There are three private dining rooms downstairs that don't cost anything to book. Perfect for a special jamboree with kith and kinfolk.  Saddle up your cayuse, put on your petticoats, put away your pistols, y'all, and mosey on over to the Sierra Bonita Grill for a heapin' helpin' of their hospitality."}
{"text":"Live in the neighborhood and have been wanting to try it. Went in for lunch on valentines day and were seated immediately. All the staff was professional and friendly. We were also impressed with how fast the food was ready.   Food had good flavors and definitely had its own \"style\" and flare.  I had the pasta dish and my wife had the Mahi Mahi fish tacos. Not traditional Mexican and wish they had some chips and salsa but a great experience over all."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. We had the sizzling peppers for an appetizer, it was simple but very flavorful. The entrees were cooked perfectly. The desert of bread pudding with warm carmel sauce just topped of the meal."}
{"text":"I'm just back from my 1st trip to SBG and I have to say I'm impressed.  A word of warning tho, it's not really all that Mexican.  It's more South West which is fine with me.  There are plenty of good Mexican places but finding a good SW restuarant in Phx can be a challenge.  We started with the Green Chile Tamale appetizer which was topped with chunks of seasoned roast pork and fresh salsa.  For an entree' I had the Pan Seared Red Trout which was served on a bed of green beans with fresh spinach, and fire roasted tomatos & peppers.  The it was all covered with some magical sauce that makes it all come alive in your mouth.  My companion had the North Central Chicken which had a glaze that's very close to a molle' and served with mashed potatos and asparagras.  We topped it off with Butter Milk Pie which takes sweet to a whole new level. All this and 2 drinks for less than $60 and excellent service.  Let me be clear, there's nothing here that really wows me, but it's a big step up from every Mexican/SW chain in town.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Insert more stars here...  Love this place.  The atmosphere, the food, the staff, you name it, it all great! Top picks for me would be the Sergio's Pork Tenderloin, the Buttermilk Chicken and the Santa Cruz Pasta, in no particular order.  But, I've tried quite a few different things there and have never been disappointed.   They finished the basement into a private party area and a wine tasting room.  Very cool.  In fact, we love this place so much we got married there!  Word of caution though, they have changed the parking in front, so you need to approach this place from the south on 7th St so you can be turning right (east) into the front parking lot.  If it's during the week rush hour it is a PITA to turn left if you're southbound on 7th."}
{"text":"Came here with very high expectations after reading that this was the BEST South western food in Phoenix. It was OK.. but did not reach my expectations. I was not happy with the fact that the chips were charged.., 1st time I see this.  I had a chile relleno which was prepared in a different way to the other 10+ restaurants I have been to - pricey too. it was so so..; my wife asked for fish and chips... she was not amazed..; my kids quesadilla was good.  Service was not the best and dishware was dirty/smelly..., asked for it to be changed and it was.  There are definitively much better options in the valley for southwestern food.  This was my 1st and last visit to this place."}
{"text":"Simply put, this place is the bees knees.  I've eaten here for years and even had my wedding rehearsal dinner here so I am intimately familiar with the restaurant.  First off, the food.  It's excellent.  The buttermilk chicken may be my favorite dish of all time.  I don't know what's in that gravy, but I suspect it's cocaine because I always need more as soon as I finish it.  This was the first place I ever had Ossobucco.  I loved it right away and have had the dish elsewhere many times...Sierra's is the best I've had so far.  This place is very well represented by their staff.  I've never had a negative experience with any wait or bar staff.  Lastly, the bread pudding.  GET ...THE...BREAD...PUDDING!"}
{"text":"Good food. Quesadilla with huitlacoche, Oaxacan pork, rubbed in chocolate and spices, guacamole made in a mocajete, and coriander rubbed mahi mahi tacos."}
{"text":"Outstanding food nice atmosphere good service the tortilla soup is some of the best I've ever had I would highly recommend this restaurant to anybody. My friend had the green enchiladas and we also had a  a side of Green Chile mac and cheese everything was outstanding"}
{"text":"Great food. Great ambiance. I met my parents and fiance for dinner here after work. We had missed happy hour but still indulged in the margaritas ($8) and wine as well as appetizers. The stuffed peppers and guacamole were delicious. So simple, so good. I've had \"upscale\" Mexican food at other restaurants (ones that try to turn burritos and quesadillas into 5 courses) and this is actually a great example of what upscale Mexican food should be. It isn't just tacos and burritos, but if that is what you are in the mood for, they have it.   Everyone at my table had something different, Buttermilk Chicken, North Central Chicken, Sergio's Pork Tenderloin (espresso chocolate rubbed :) ) and the Chicken Enchiladas. It was all delicious and we all loved ours but my personal favs were Sergio's Pork Tenderloin and the Chicken Enchiladas. Yum Yum. My meal, the Chicken Enchiladas was technically an appetizer but it was SO much food, overflowing with sauce and cheese, I don't know how you would split this as an app and my recommendation is take it as an entree. We also finished the meal with the famous bread pudding which is made using a croissant base rather than regular bread. Yes, this helps explain why it is so fantastic.   Only negative on the evening was the house wine ended up being $13/glass (and no we didn't have just one). I had looked over the wine list before ordering my marg (good choice) and they had glasses starting at $6 so it is surprising the house wine was over twice that. Maybe the waitress hustled us. Overall, besides that little blemish, service was very good even with the place bustling on a Tuesday evening.   Parking--I wasn't fortunate enough to make it in the parking lot, but the street did the job fine and wasn't more than a minute walk.   Will definitely be again (and we recommend reviewing the wine list before ordering :)  If your going to spend $13/glass, it may as well be something you love)"}
{"text":"The staff was very attentive and I thought the ambience, as well as the atmosphere was great.  The food was good, as well. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"If I could give a Higher star rating, I would!!  My stepmom had a Living Social deal, which lead us to this AMAZING place.  It was my last night in town and the parents decided to try this new (to them) spot.  My parents eat out a lot and to find out we were trying a 'new' place was exciting.  I was heading back to California, and I wish I would have eaten here my first night because I would have liked to visit it again before I left.  I live in a region of Northern California that highlights fresh, farm-raised, local, organic ingredients.  This exceeded any expectations that I am used to in my neck of the woods.  Every item we order was EXCEPTIONAL!!  We started with the Guac, chips and salsa trio.  Every salsa was fresh, bright and very tasty!!  Next was the bacon wrapped shrimp, the carne asada tacos starter, and the green chile starter.  I had the Enchiladas Suizas.  Of course we all tasted each others dishes and none of them dissappointed.  This is a great aproach to the traditional Mexican food I am used to (Garcia's de las Avenidas, Manuel's, La Perla).  Everything was super fresh, very bright, and all the flavors OUTSTANDING!! Oh and how could I forget to mention the dessert....Whiskey Bread Pudding!!!  We shared one, but I could have easily eaten one by myself.  And lastly the service was stellar!!  Our server, seemed to be also the bartender, didn't catch his name (server #88)....but bartending did not detract from his great service.  He was attentive, but just the perfect amount.  His input was helpful, and comments insightful!!  You have a great team and the formula you've devised to run this well oiled machine is just about perfect!!!  Thanks for a great experience, GREETINGS from the Mendocino Coast!!!  Can't wait to come visit again..."}
{"text":"High quality, tasty food.  Loved the house salad.  My guest raved about his beef dish."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times and it gets better with every visit. Great ambience and terrific quick service! Well worth every dime!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. This is a great local eatery! The bar is fun and lively, its a great place to come with or without the kids. The food is an excellent interpretation of great south western cuisine. Service is spot on by a team of young fresh pros..... Cant wait til we visit next."}
{"text":"My goodness, what a meal. This was our second time here. We couldn't wait to get back to Phoenix and eat here again.  When you go in look above the hostess stand at the chalk board. They list several bottles of wine that are on close-out specials. We have scored nice bottles at a great price on both visits.  Their guacamole, chips and salsa are very good. I had the Red chili pork roast for dinne. It was probably the best south western dish I have ever had. The meat was flavorful, the rice was good and the beans were cooked to perfection. The flavors all blended together very well. I hate to fall into a rut but I would order this every time I go back.  The last time we were here I had the fish taco's. Those were good and I almost ordered them again. I'm glad I didn't.  They also have a nice private table in the wine cellar for 8-10 people."}
{"text":"This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I've been many times and it's always fabulous. I LOVE their Mahi Mahi Tacos - they are so good! I also highly recommend the Pork Osco Bucco, Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast, and the Cowboy Beef Stew. The nightly specials are often very creative and delicious. This place is also good for Sunday brunch. Good bartender too - drinks are never too weak."}
{"text":"In town for work, eating solo...this place was great. Good atmosphere, bustling, and I didn't feel weird about eating alone. I sat at the bar. Friendly and attentive bartenders, very helpful when I asked for suggestions.  Sizzling poppers - Yeah I ate a plate of those cheese stuffed jalapenos. Not throat burning spicy, although the bartender warned that sometimes they are really hot. Great start with a cold beer. I had the Kilt Lifter, tasty.  Sergios pork tenderloin - Oaxacan and espresso rubbed tenderloin with vanilla bean sauce. The sauce sounds sketchy but I tell you, it worked. That piece o' pig was delightful. The roasted veggies were pretty good too, not mushy or old. Excellent recommendation.   Croissant bread pudding - Yes, I kept eating. Don't judge. Big portion, tasty. The bourbon sauce makes this dish.  Look at a map before you try to find it. The side of the building faces the road so it's easy to miss. There's free valet parking so don't freak out when you don't see any open spots.   It's the sort of place that would have been fun with people I love, but equally as nice by myself on the road."}
{"text":"Look it upsets me that you have to give even one star.   I can read the other reviews and I have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner.   Yes, we were the table of 7 people at about 8pm, yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together. You would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1/2 of a waiter. It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch.   You know what sucks more than working 2 shifts? How about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts, it was so nice of the manager to let him leave, but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders?   Simply the food was not good and you are over priced.  But the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job, THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring."}
{"text":"Great decor, good staff, BUT I have been disapointed the two times I ordered their burger.   The meat patty appears to be formed with a press leaving the burger with little personality and the taste was a bit on the dry side with limited flavor..    The burger should be hand-formed with the fat ratio high enough to prevent dryness and enhance the flavor.  I felt the price was high for the quality received."}
{"text":"This place not only has delicious food but wonderful service. We've been here multiple times before but we ended up here last Sunday after being ambushed out of another restaurant for their awful service. How silly we felt for not coming here first. Our waitress was very kind and accommodating considering our party of 5 and a small child came with no reservation. The food is always delicious, specifically the Carne asada. The bread pudding is a wonderful treat along side an old fashioned. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Oh boy,,, I was so so excited to try this place.   I guess I should know better than to have my hopes up, eh but you live an learn right. So I will spare you the gore like details and sum it all up for you,, with a line from Billy Madison..\"Don't go,,, Stay as long as you can!\"  Bad food, Bad service, and I'm outie 5000"}
{"text":"Sierra Bonita Grill is one of my husband's and my regular restaurants we visit. The food is excellent! Many times we share the Carne Asada Dinner which is a delicious blend of spices complete with the best home made tortillas!! If we are feeling particularly decadent we order the buttermilk pie for dessert! Yummy!!   We love the atmosphere! First off the mesquite grill gives off the most appetizing aroma, the lighting is soft, and you can sit at a private booth and actually have a conversation without yelling at each other because you can't hear over the noise.   I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I love Sierra Boninta Grill as much as I love warm jammies out of the dryer.  It's a staple in my family.  Good wine selection and fabulous food.  My friend and I enjoyed our lunch next to the roaring fireplace.  Service has never let us down.  This place is small but lovely and cozy.  Get the Buttermilk Chicken and thank me later."}
{"text":"Our new favorite TexMex place. Today we sampled some of their appetizers: chips & signature sauces, Azteca soup & Hopper's Poppers...& freshly squeezed margaritas, of course. DELISH, we will definitely return to try other menu selections. Excellent service."}
{"text":"You like beef, chorizo, cheese, and eggs? Well, you can get all of them rolled into a single package at Sierra Bonita.   The SBG Signature burger is off the hook good. The classic tasty of a burger mixed with the distinctive flavor of chorizo. The fries were nice and crispy as well.  Vibe was good, portions were good, and the service was fast and friendly.   Check it out...."}
{"text":"Very pleasant, service was great, food was good, prices reasonable. I will go there again when I go to Phoenix. Enjoyed the chips, the tacos and the enchiladas."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously amazing! The food is consistent with the taste. Great place for the family, date nights or just because. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We took some friends here last night for a birthday.  I will start by saying $8.00 WELL vodka.  Ketel One you ask, NO!  I am pretty sure it came from a plastic bottle that reads rubbing alcohol.    Moving on.  Food was good but the kitchen has major plating  inconsistencies.  My friend's husband and I both got the salmon special.  The food was great but his dish had 90% more veggies on it than mine did.  Funny thing, he hates veggies and I love them.  This may be a little OCD of me but I counted them.  My plate had 3 small cauliflower florets, and 3 1/4 pieces of purple potato (this does not even equal a whole purple potato).   Our friend's plate had a mound of veggies and he was nice enough to share.  I understand that kitchens are busy on a Friday night but quality control should be there, if not from the kitchen then the server.  When you pay the kind of money we did ($50 pp), you expect consistency.  Safe to say we will not go back."}
{"text":"The service is extremely slow.  From taking our order, bringing the food out (my taco meat was barely warm), and even getting someone to take our payment.  Ridiculously slow!!!!  Place is cute, clean and cozy.  Server was nice.  Guacamole app was delicious!    It was a first time here and because of the wait I don't think we'll come back again!"}
{"text":"First timer, was impressed. Had the Cowboy stew, very good.  Great place for casual dinner with guests, quiet enough for conversation.  Excellent menu choices. Service was just right."}
{"text":"Cool local spot but there are definitely better options for the ambiance and price point."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for my birthday dinner and it was SO GOOD!  The service was outstanding and our food was soooo tasty!   We ate ceviche, chicken enchiladas, and their carne asada.  The Ceviche was great, with lots of shrimp but our absolute fave was the carne asada.   I also had a sangria, which was a great way to top off our meal.  This would be a great place to take out of town guests, or clients, the ambiance is a cozy southwestern feel.   We are going back for their brunch for sure!!  We highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"if you are planning a private party or event, this is the best place in town!!  amazing amazing food, and kindest, caring staff and management.  i had the good fortune of hosting an event here tonight, in which they had a private room for us with a screen and projection for my presentation. everything was just perfect throughout our entire event. this place is sheer perfection.!!! am so impressed with sierra bonita!!  loved loved loved it!!!!  thank you nate, tony and debbie for making our event spectacular!!!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Perfect.  PROS: 1. Amazingly tasty food with a great selection of menu options 2. Great drinks 3. Fair prices 4. Nice and comfortable rustic-elegant decor."}
{"text":"Came in at lunchtime, first thing very noisy! Margarita was good if you want tacos go to filobertos . Enjoyed the carne asada lunch bit was lacking that certain something overall good service food was good but not fantastic"}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to the 5th star but the good news is that there's room for improvement.  The decor is great, charming and comfortable.  The food was really good. Nice guacamole, crispy chips, tasteful salsas.  I had the shrimp cocktail which worth the visit, seriously was delicious. For me, the best shrimp cocktail I've ever had in AZ.  I also tried the carne asada tacos and the tomato soup. They were pretty tasteful.  The rocky mountain desert was also awesome (but be careful, it's a pretty large serving, you might be better off sharing it).   My only two concerns would be that we had 2 extra green salsas and one of them seemed to be from a different batch, kind of right out of the fridge and it didn't taste as fresh as the previous one.  The other concern was that the beans (side of the tacos) were a little too salty.  BTW, we had a minor incident (an unforeseen kitchen issue) which was managed in a super professional way which also speaks great of this place. I mean, accidents or small things always happen in restaurants but the difference is made by the way they handle them. And this place did great!  Certainly will go back to try more of their delicious dishes!  Cheers"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Me and my friend came here for lunch and both of us couldn't have been more pleased with our meals and the service. The restaurant is clean and open, the wait staff were all extremely friendly and attentive. We wondered if we got free chips and salsa with our lunch and they said not usually but told us one minute and came out with a huge platter of chips as well as four different salsas! Needless to say, we were very impressed. I have the Azteca soup and it was delicious also very refreshing. My friend had the buttermilk chicken, which you think would be a weird choice for a traditional Mexican restaurant however it was so amazing this is what I'd want to get next time I come here! Overall great experience and I can't wait to come here again."}
{"text":"Sierra Bonita scored another big hit with my husband and I last night. Couldn't have been more perfect, from the hostess greeting us, updating us about our reservation status, making she knew where we were, etc. Bartender makes a perfect martini, and our favorite waiter recommended a new, very good wine. My husband tried the Sea Bass special, with tiny pieces of sausage, apples, roast corn and green beans; the fish melted in your mouth. I had Sergio's Roast Pork Loin which is rubbed with a Chocolate-Espresso blend and served on a light vanilla reduced butter sauce, with spinach and roasted baby potatoes. Now I see what everyone's been talking about.   Nate the owner is a perfect manager, socializing with the guests at the right moment while keeping one eye on everything going on around him. I hope this restaurant is here for many years to come because it's my favorite in all of metropolitan Phoenix."}
{"text":"Saturday Brunch anyone!?  This has been a favorite spot for a few years. When I was looking for some place to take a friend for a Saturday ride and lunch, Sierra Bonita popped in my head. Little did I know they have an AWESOME Saturday Brunch!  My #1 go to if you are dining at SB is the South West Benedict. I am in for any Eggs Benedict, and when you find a place that truly kicks it up a notch, I'm in! Panko crusted eggs atop chile beer biscuits with cure 81 ham (another favorite) with roasted poblano hollandaise! \"YES PLEASE!\"  eeling like the traditional southwest flare? You must try the Breakfast Enchiladas, enchiladas done right. Scrambled eggs, carne asada, chorizo (another favorite) and Manchego cheese. What don't forget the side of charro beans (WOW)!  The Cowboy Hash and Chile Relleno are also great at the SB.  The staff is stellar and our bar tender was fun and extremely knowledgeable of the menu, even had suggestions on what to get. The entire staff at the SB are great and I found another place to give a great F.A.S.T. review on the staff because they are that good."}
{"text":"So Mr. Hottie and I were grabbing a quick lunch. The place I wanted to go was closed on Mondays. So after thinking a bit, he suggested trying Sierra Bonita. We walked into a Southwestern style restaurant complete with all the typical decorations. We were seated in a booth and our drink order was taken. We were left to review the menu. I was happy that they had dinner and lunch specials that were not offered on the regular menu. I chose one of the specials which was a pasta made with scallops and sauteed brussel sprouts, and sauteed cherry tomatoes. The food did take quite a while to come out. Considering we were about the 3rd or 4th occupied table in the entire place, the kitchen was very slow.  When the food was served, it looked great! I took a bite of my pasta. The noodles (thin spaghetti) were a little too al dente. I love al dente pasta, but those noodles could have used maybe 3-4 more minutes of boiling. The dish was great other than the slightly undercooked pasta. It was a nice, light dish with great flavor! The scallops were cooked perfectly and tasted fresh and sweet. The sprouts and tomatoes were sauteed well. They still had the freshness and burst of flavor and were not overcooked to a mush. Mr. Hottie enjoyed his 5 Chile Spiced Chicken Sandwich. I stole a bite. The chicken was very well seasoned and the pesto mayo lent a lot of flavor to the sandwich. On our way out, I noticed the cute patio with a fireplace. I think I would like to arrange a possible UYE to see what everyone else thinks of this place. I look forward to trying Sierra Bonita's other offerings, and maybe awarding another star!"}
{"text":"Great local eatery - I've been a few times and love to get the chips & salsa with guacamole; it's so good! The burgers are amazing as are the street tacos and the chicken enchiladas my husband got were excellent - the desserts are all great and you can never go wrong with the specials such as the salmon they feature frequently!"}
{"text":"Met up with some locals who took me here as its their favorite restaurant.  Now its mine too!  Nice atmosphere and the menu goes from $$ to $$$ (interesting burgers up to filet mignon with chilies).  I had the sea bass cooked in a corn husk with asparagus.  It was fantastic.  The chilie poppers and guac as appetizers were also excellent.  The margaritas were top notch (both the basic and the next one up).  We took a short tour and saw a nice private room downstairs (wine bottle theme) that would hold 10 people and another two rooms that would hold more.  Excellent place for a corporate dinner.  All in all, I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time to Sierra Bonita, and wont be the last.  After a long day for both my wife and I, it had the perfect setting/atmosphere for a nice meal.  The bacon wrapped shrimp were awesome.  We each had the fish tacos and carne asada tacos. Both were delicious as well. Will recommend and return soon!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a while, and I've always been impressed with the food, service, and drinks. Last Friday night was no exception. Another stellar night with the Sierra Bonita staff. We had a private party of 20 people and the service was second to none. There was only one server, but she was on the spot with everything, my hat off to her. The food was exceptional, especially the special of rib rib. The guacamole is some of the best I have ever tasted.  What can I say, I continue to go back here for a reason. This place is a special place and the staff, and food make it GREAT! P.S. The bartenders are some of the best in town!"}
{"text":"this place was pretty good had the fish tacos one was salmon witch never had in a taco before and the other was a Maui Maui I think that one was OK came with mix veggies rather then rice and beans witch I like the place inside would be a cool place to come and hang out looks like they have good drink specials the server was nice and she knew the menu very well because I don't eat pork she knew was dishes and sauce that had it in it because most place don't that the only this I didn't like was most if the menu contained pork I will be back soon with the wife for some drinks and gub"}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at Sierra Bonita since they first opened. They keep getting better. One primary differentiator I can point out about this place is that they do not skimp on the veggies. A lot of the time, eating out means carbs with a side-o-carbs, featuring one protein ingredient and maybe some cheese. They don't just do vegetables as an afterthought, they use delicious and unusual ones. Their mix has green and purple romanesco, rainbow carrots, broccoli, squash, green beans, spinach and usually sauteed with butter and rosemary. Sometimes choyote is in the mix too - at brunch, order Cowboy Hash. And then all too often, at other places beans are \"just beans\" and don't have much flavor (or my least favorite, are honey-like and sugary). Sierra Bonita's beans are totally rich and flavorful, they're whole beans, not refried and are super savory, elevated far above the ordinary \"side of beans.\" They have a Moscow Mule that comes in a copper cup and tastes super refreshing in the summertime (plus you can rest the cup on the inside of your wrists to cool down from your drive there). I love their Southwestern Cobb salad for lunch. Their Carne Asada is super filling, even the half-size. Same goes for the Buttermilk Chicken, and it's nice to get mashed sweet potatoes instead of just mashed potatoes. Lots of good, rich flavors and intensity here. They have a new dinner appetizer, butter-braised mushrooms. OMG these are to die for. There's gorgonzola cheese in there, and maybe a little bit of heaven. I've had the Albondigas soup, the green chile posole and the Azteca soup and they're all rich and deliciously filling.  Then the most out-there sounding dinner entree: chocolate and espresso-rubbed pork tenderloin. It says all this but the taste that pops out the most is the vanilla. It's like Holy Crap, how did anyone think this up and how does it actually work so well? Gah ... I just ate there for dinner and writing all this makes me hungry all over again. They just added salmon tacos to their menu. Totally heart-healthy, what a good excuse to go. Super juicy and delicious.  Everyone who works there is nice and relaxed and a lot of them have been there for years. Happy hour is fun. There are always people from the neighborhood there and their jalapeno poppers are super delicious - not fried with ranch dressing like a pub would have. Their jalapenos are sliced and filled with seriously flavorful cheese and served on a skillet with a tomato wedge sizzling in between each pepper. I could go on, but if you do a ctrl-f search on my review for the word \"super\" you'll find a word count that's high enough to show what I think of this place."}
{"text":"I visit Sierra Bonita about 4-5 times each year, Their happy hour is an exceptionally good value when you take into account the consistent quality of their appetizers.  However, I do eat a full dinner occasionally, as I did last Friday night which was a great disappointment.  We rolled in around 6 pm, and I was glad to see they had prime rib special. When it came time to order it, however, it was already gone.  The waiter explained 12 people had already ordered it -  how can a special only serve 12 people when it is a busy night (and they do get busy there)? So I opted for one of my favorite dishes there, the pork green chili Osso Bucco. I remember the great flavor and presentation of the dish. Big mistake.  It looked nothing like the times before.  It was this mound of cornstarchy, green chili sauce with little flavor drowning the cheddar mash and pork in such quantity you couldn't even tell or taste what you were eating. The pork was fatty and there was an overabudance of undercooked onions. Terrible. Even worse when you consider the $28 price tag. My husband ordered the Oaxacan chocolate rubbed tenderloin served with mixed vegetables and a vanilla bean butter sauce. It was nicely presented but very little flavor considering the description of such exotic  ingredients, although the meat was nicely cooked.  Our dinner partner ordered her favorite, the buttermilk chicken dish with mashed chili sweet potatoes, which she described as delicious. They must have a new cook or two because there wasn't any consistency with the food. Also, it was so busy we didn't get a water refill until our meals were over.  The lesson learned: go to the happy hour - that is always good and affordable for the price.  And weekdays give you a better chance for quality service - and, hopefully, access to the special of the night."}
{"text":"Hosted a bridal shower last weekend in the private banquet room downstairs for 21 women.   It was awesome.  Food was great - service was impeccable.  Tony and Nate were both great to work with and the bride couldn't have been happier. It's a special place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service!! We come here at least once a week!   I highly recommend any fish they offer as a special.  They never disappoint! There is a perfect balance of sauce and sides-- Every time I order, I think how can they get better than the last time-- but they do!!!!! The grilled Cesar is awesome// if you've never had a grilled salad- try it here."}
{"text":"One of our regular spots to eat! Love the Sierra Bonita salad and the Posole soup is fantastic. Really everything on the menu is great and food is spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"One of my \"go to\" restaurants! Discretely tucked away just south of 7th Street and Glendale. High quality food. Great happy hour options. Recommend that you check out one of Phoenix's hidden gems!"}
{"text":"Labor Day was my first visit to SBG. First impressions are big for me and walking in the door I was very impressed! The look and feel of the bar and restaurant is very inviting, well designed and very comfortable. We met another couple there who had never been as well. Two of us had the Pork Osso Bucco , another had the steak special and the other the trout. Everyone agreed the food was wonderful! Two of us are into dessert so we tried the croissant bread pudding. OMG! Out of this world good! We will definately be back to SBG! The only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars was the server didn't greet us very timely, I think the host staff didn;t inform her she had a table. After she got started though the service was excellent! The Martinis were awesome as well!! ;-)"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a fellow colleague.  My first visit and I was impressed.  The service was fast and courteous.  I ordered the carne asada and my friend had the green chili pork.  The carne asada was fantastic. It was very tender and had a nice spice to it.  My friend said his chili pork was very good.  I would like to try their happy hour as they have a number of wine choices to choose from and the restaurant has a classy vibe to it."}
{"text":"I have never given five stars before.   But, everything was perfect.   Great atmosphere.   Wonderful happy hour.   Great service.   Green chili pork was excellent.     Buttermilk chicken also delicious.      Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Went for brunch last Saturday and had breakfast enchiladas.  They were great.  This is one of our favorites in Phx"}
{"text":"Been coming here for several years now.  The food and drinks are always excellent.  The past two times we were in, the service was terrible.  We came in this past weekend and were ignored for at least five minutes.  We finally ordered and our food came quickly - too quickly, in fact.  Our entrees were brought out at the exact same time as our appetizers.  After our food was delivered, we were ignored once again.  And again.  And again.  Our wine glasses remained empty and our server was nowhere in sight.  We were never even offered water.  Someone else finally came over and offered another round of drinks after we had finished our meal.  We declined.  The last time we were in, our server was downright hostile and rude for no apparent reason.  I'm not sure what is going on with the wait staff these days.  We've always had good experiences prior to the last two times.  I love the food and atmosphere, but I'm not sure we will be returning."}
{"text":"The outside of the building is deceptive. Inside is an elegant, cozy, comfortable restaurant. Owned and operated by a trained chef, the menu offers a great interpretation of southwestern food. Local craft beers and a good wine selection is available."}
{"text":"Great meal- love the private dinning room down stairs. Great guac burger. Starters a must."}
{"text":"We had our business Christmas celebration at Sierra Bonita. The food was Amazing! The service was disappointing. We were a large group (12 or so ) but I ordered the carne asada  with out the pesto mayo the waiter understood but still got the mayo. The tacos were still good and I didn't say anything but bummed. The waiter didn't refill drinks or clear plates very well. I didn't let bother me but we spent $500 bucks we deserve more drink refills at least. Again the food was great but service OK not great"}
{"text":"My mother and I eat here on a weekly basis, and it's the first place we think to take any friends when they come to town. There isn't one thing on the menu I wouldn't recommend, but the Buttermilk Chicken is incredible, lick-your-plate good, and the Azteca soup is staple in my diet.   They are also VERY vegan/vegetarian friendly and are willing to make you whatever you need. My mother is a vegan and regularly orders a variety of delicious items. The kitchen NEVER serves boring steamed vegetables and the waitresses never simply direct her to a salad. Sometimes, her little inventions are my personal favorites!  Make sure to hit the place up on the weekend, when the roll out a fantastic and unique brunch menu.  Whatever you do, get yourself a never-ending plate of chips, guacamole, and salsa."}
{"text":"The buttermilk chicken was amazing.   Liked the ambiance.  We will be back. A little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious food! I really enjoyed everything and the signature margarita is a must have! The atmosphere was very relaxing- we sat on the patio. Everyone was very friendly and the service was really good. This was my first time there, very good first impression. I'm going back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love SB.  I eat there at least once a week and find that the menu has a good variety.  I like the daily menu with different seafood items.  Jessica is the best!!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for brunch. The restaurant is quite dark, and smells of smoked wood, which I got excited about - as I love smoked meats.  Suffice to say, I didn't find anything on the menu to indicate anything was smoked. I am quite confused by this. I'm not really sure about the brunch menu - it's really just a variation of a dinner menu with a fried egg on top.   Our waitress came 4 times to the table before taking our order. (Once to say hello, once to get the bloody mary, once to send the bloody mary back, once to order guacamole and then our order.)   First - I got a bloody mary. It's brunch after all. Lesson: don't do this. It was a thin, watery concoction with an abundance of lime juice (and I like lime juice in my bloodys in the right proportion). It really just had no flavor in the mix and the consistency of Clamato. There was little to no seasoning in it (Worchester? Tabasco? Salt? Pepper?) and forget the celery. I will not get another of these.   I did, however have a margarita instead. It was pleasantly good - lime juice, triple sec, agave nectar and tequila. Perfect. Not too sweet and no sweet & sour pucker afterward.   We ordered the guacamole after balking at the $9 price. It says it was made in what I think is like a mortar and pestle, but presented in a small bowl. I have to say for $9 in Arizona - it should be presented better and you should get a lot more of it. It came with three small salsas - a tomatillo, roasted tomato and pico de gallo. The guacamole, and salsas were good - but for what you get is very over priced.  After trying to figure out what I wanted (after the disappointment of nothing being smoked meat) I decided to go with the burger route - thinking there might be something special about the burger. Nope. Just your average burger. Again, I'm not so much of a burger fan - so I'm not sure why I order them occasionally - but I think this time I was hoping to taste some of the smoky goodness in the air. I didn't get that.   Overall, I won't be back. But I can't say it was sub-par. Just average."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Always friendly waitress Jes & always great food.  We have a wonderful lunch every time. I enjoy the southwestern cobb it has just the right amount of everything in it & flavorful steak to top it off. Jessica's smiling face makes the lunch even sweeter, but also the gelato hits the spot."}
{"text":"My experience with Sierra Bonita Grill today has inspired me to sign up for a yelp account so I can forewarn others about planning a party at this establishment. I have been using Yelp for years but never felt motivated enough to actually get an account until today.   About 1 1/2 weeks ago a friend and I were enjoying happy hour and I thought, hey they have a great patio I should do my going away happy hour here. I have lived in the Valley for 13 years and wanted a low key place in mid-town to see my friends one last time. I spoke with the hostess who said the manager would give me a call to finalize the details. A week and a helf went by... no call. After I had posted this location on facebook, and had 20 RSVPs, I called Sierra Bonita and spoke with a manager (who shall remain nameless but if I were the owner I would fire).    This is when I was informed that in order to use the patio you need to spend $600. That's a lot of happy hour drinks! I said that I could not guarantee this. I asked if a group of people just came to happy hour with out a reservation, and we did not have the patio exclusively for us is that was ok. This is when I was told that I would still have to pay the $600 to use the patio. I was told, and I quote, \"Well most people don't show up in a group that big and if they did we would not allow you to come in\". WTF???? I then asked, \"So you would rather have an empty patio on a Friday night, than have 20 people who would be buying food and drinks for 2 hours?\"   I was then told that if we showed up in a group that big with no reservation, we would be turned away!!! I then said kindly \"Ok, thank you. I think I will choose another location for my party.\" I know there are lots of options in Phoenix for happy hour, and although Sierra Bonita does not want our patronage, any other location would be welcoming...  In this economy I cannot believe that a small independently owned establishment would turn away a group of 20+."}
{"text":"I didn't really enjoy this place as much as I though I would menu was a bit bleh..or maybe it.just wasn't my day."}
{"text":"At the risk of repeating myself, this has quickly become my go-to for so many reasons:  Frst of all, the staff are ALWAYS happy, welcoming, and creative!  My oldest friend and I went for brunch today as we do at least once a month.  I am burned out on mexican/southwestern for the time being so was having trouble deciding on a restaurant in general.  SB won out for the reasons above plus more.  We sat in the back room to take advantage of the sunshine and relative quiet; I enjoyed meeting the folks at the next table, who were definitely happy about their circumstances as well.  The first order of the day was breakfast cocktails.  Couldn't make my mind up there either so our fabulous waiter asked us about our preferences, then surprised us with some fabulous coffees with bourbon in them.  OMG, perfect!  We finished up on those and started in on margueritas.  They were also perfect and custom made for us.  When it came time to order, I was not quite ready to choose.  As usual, our server had some great recommendations for us.  We split the Benedict; we both dig the panko-crusted egg and the hollandaise.  We also split a relleno with the requisite fried egg on it; I hadn't had one there before and it totally hit the spot!  So, SB, the good company, service, and food really set the tone for the day.  As usual, it was perfect.  Thanks for getting my day started right!!  NOW: get those breakfast plantains on the menu already!  Maybe tortilla crepes stuffed with them?"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for awhile. The service was great. Food was nothing great, in my opinion. A little pricey for what it is. I got stacked enchiladas and it tasted like they used canned chicken. I may be wrong, but it tasted like it. I wouldn't go again. Wasn't horrible, just not worth a 50 dollar bill."}
{"text":"We went here because we had a gift card. We will definitely be back. We had the bacon  wrapped shrimp and carne asada, both excellent! Service was spot on and atmosphere was charming. Will recommend to friends! Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is another great place to hit in the central phoenix area.   We went on a Saturday night, wait for a table was 20 minutes but, we found two seats at the bar and decided to forgo the table.  Bar staff was fast and super friendly - always checking in on us. We ordered the Green chile mac n cheese and it was fantastic! Creamy, cheesy and perfect hit of heat!  We followed that up with the five spice chicken sandwich. It was a large portion, perfect to share, topped with bacon, cheese and pesto mayo. Chicken was very tender and packed with flavor. Fries were fresh and crisp.  Overall, this is an excellent choice for a meal with a fresh spin on some classics. Price points were a little high but, food was awesome. So, maybe happy hour is more budget friendly option..."}
{"text":"Words can't really express how great this place is.  Probably the best quest dip I've ever had and I don't normally even like quest dip.  Ceviche is great as well.  But the burger the BGB 'or something like that', burger might be the best burger I have ever had.  It has chorizo meat patty with green chili and an egg on top.  You won't have success picking this burger up and eating it, so get that fork ready!"}
{"text":"I feel bad giving this restaurant only 2 stars, but my experience here was not as positive as the previous reviewers.  We sat at the bar and was admiring the atmosphere. It was warm and cozy and I can tell there were a lot of regulars, like a southwestern version of \"Cheers\", where everybody knows your name. Across the way, a few staff members took a shot with a \"regular\" laughing and just having a good ol' time. So back to my 2 stars, the service was great; it was the food that was lacking. My husband and I shared the sizzlin' peppers, which the cheese slid right off of the pepper. The peppers and cheese had no taste to them. My husbands chicken enchiladas was bland too. The texture of the chicken was moist, it just didn't have any flavor at all. I had the signature burger which had a mixture of beef and chorizo on ciabatta bun w/ cheese, green pepper and a fried egg. The description made me salivate, but to my dismay, the whole thing feel apart and the fries tasted like a bag of frozen fries from Costco (I'm not knockin' Costco, but I'd enjoy at home, not at a restaurant). I think a burger should be judged by how it can stick together too, but maybe that's just me. The actual meat patty was tasty, but the whole thing was just a mess and I couldn't enjoy it. Tried it the next day as leftovers, which validated my disappointment. It also made me realize, the pepper had no flavor and the beef was the only thing that was tasty. I wanted to like this place, but will not be going back. :("}
{"text":"Mmmmm.... I love Sierra Bonita! Just a great restaurant with a carefully thought-out menu and great service. Their weekend brunch is amazing."}
{"text":"Great Spot!  Wonderful food and excellent service!  This is a long distance from our home but worth the journey.  It is located on the southeast corner of East Glendale Avenue and 7th Street.  There is construction on Glendale Avenue making it tough to get here.  A better alternative is to take Northern to 7th Street and then go south. We ate there with dear friends and we all loved what we were served.  They serve half portions of many dishes and the half portions are large enough to make a meal.  By the way, try Hopper's Poppers as an appetizer!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Service beyond exceptional! Be sure to ask for Keely. She's dynamite - so personable and SO  good. Of course, we enjoyed the food,but Keely;s outstanding service made the meal even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! Great venue, and clean. Exceptional service, will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Very comfy ambiance and great food. Try the guacamole app, it comes with a trio of fresh salsa and it's very good.   SB has some great drinks as well, the house margarita Which is the red-headed step child at most places, is done very well at SB.   For dinner I had the carne asada plate. The meat was very good, served on a bed of tasty rice. The tortillas were very good- and were a pleasant surprise.   Service was warm, fast, and friendly. Jessica was great and the bussers also worked very hard and kept everything moving.   SB is a great place to have a fresh and delicious dinner. The service, value, and food are all great and you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Sierra Bonita is almost false advertisement.  Apparently this was named after a ranch and I was under the impression it was a form of Mexican food.  This was further confused by the large amount of Mexican food options on the menu.    Warning: this is not a Mexican restaurant.  Don't let the name or menu fool you.  This is a cowboy ranch style food that has a lot of Mexican dishes or at least attempts of it.  Let's start with the decor.  There are a bunch of cowboys on the wall and most of them look like George Dubbya.  Not what I'm looking for when I go to a spot named Sierra Bonita.  It would be much more accurate and non misleading if you named it Pretty Mountain Range Ranch Restaurant.  Guess it doesn't have the same ring to it.  The reason I bring this up is because the same theme is reflected in the cuisine.  Non-authentic doesn't even say enough.  I swear the guacamole tasted like the guacamole live you buy in a bag from Costco.  I would put money on it.  The salsas were very basic and boring.  No spice or heat whatsoever.    After the weak guac and salsas I instinctively stayed away from other Mexican imitations and ordered Sergio's pork tenderloin.  Chocolate and espresso rubbed pork tenderloin with a butter vanilla sauce with some roasted vegetables and potatoes.   The pork tenderloin was very tasty.  The sweetness of the sauce and the coffee/chocolate rub worked very well together and was fun on the taste buds.  The vegetables unfortunately were not roasted nor were the potatoes.  The chef chopped up some huge chunks of bell pepper and some other vegetables, barely cooked them for a couple minutes with some oil then threw them on a plate.  Even if they were roasted they didn't compliment the tenderloin.  A small amount of roasted vegetables and some mashed potatoes would have been a better pair for the dish.  My wife ordered the enchiladas.  They were just okay for me.  They were covered in a tomatillo sauce that had too much lime.  While the flavor was good again there was zero heat or spice and very non authentic.  The rice and beans that came with her enchiladas were the highlight of the meal.  The rice and beans backed up the cowboy ranch theme on the walls.  I know this place doesn't claim to be Mexican food but if you are going to name yourself Sierra Bonita and serve guac, salsa, enchiladas, carne asada, etc etc then you better know how to prepare it and get with the program.  Based on the taste of the tenderloin, Sierra Bonita would do itself a favor by adding Ranch Cowboy Style and perhaps even drop all the Mexican fare and stick to what they do best.    If you are looking for guac, salsa, enchiladas, aka Mexican food then look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a tasty pork tenderloin, cowboy rice and beans come here."}
{"text":"We ventured in for lunch hoping for the same kind of experience we have always had at dinner.  The special was fish but at noon they were already out of it.  Then I say....erase it from the board.  I continued to hear other customers ask for it after us and hear the same excuse that they ran out.  So I ordered my usual, the carne asada tacos. Two tacos for $12 did seem expensive.  It was until later when I was home and still hungry, that my husband said, \"Why didn't you at least get beans with that?\" The service was sketchy.   It helped if we waved our arms to get her attention."}
{"text":"Sierra Bonita has an absolutely killer happy hour.  You can get yourself  an amazingly strong Pomegranate margarita and a sampling of some of the tastiest (and cheapest) appetizers around town.  The scallops and bacon wrapped shrimp and divine, and the tamale is one of the best in the valley.    The restaurant has a great dark and cozy feel... perfect for a date night out.  The outdoor patio is well shaded, and is one of my favorite spots to sit.  They also have a couple of fantastic private rooms on the lower level, if you need that kind of thing.  Though this is a frequent happy hour stop for me, I haven't actually had dinner there... I should probably check out the main menu and enjoy Sierra Bonita in all its glory!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night with my husband and 11 month old. They were great with the baby, our server immediately asked if they could get started on something for him while my husband and I pursued the menu. We ordered a kids' quesadilla but I asked to have some spinach thrown in there for the kiddo, no problem, the server said they could make anything. Well, we get the quesadilla (delivered by another server) and there was no spinach in it. Before I even had a chance to send it back, our regular server came and apologized as I guess he checked with the kitchen staff, for the lack of spinach. Amazing service all around - proactive, attentive and accommodating. When you're out with a small child, these things mean so much more during a dining experience. The food was okay, we just smacked on small plates and shared a burger. The Azteca soup was awesome, guacamole could have used some more flavor (maybe some lime, salt, and a pinch of spice), chips were stale. Burger was decent, but I ordered well done - probably would have been better cooked medium - and they were happy to add a green chili. Bacon wrapped shrimp, meh, the BBQ sauce drizzled on the side had to have been the kind you buy at Safeway, the dipping sauce was just awful. We'll give this place another try and go for regular entrees. 2 stars for food, and add 1 star for exceptional service all around."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't try Sierra Bonita sooner, it was just a great place to have lunch today!  You knew it was going to be good before you even got served anything because of the great attention to details.  Phenomenally clean, not so much as a stray tortilla chip on the floor.  And, this is probably just me, but the washroom has good smelling soap (I absolutely loathe when places use the cheap ass pink junk). The guacamole (though nine dollars) was quite good, it came accompanied by a trio of salsas which were also good.  I had citrus grilled chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables, my buddy had the five spice chicken sandwich with some nice crispy fries.  There was not a loser in the bunch, everything was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. I'll definitely go here again, though the steep prices make happy hour that much more appealing.  And $2 beers too!!  :)"}
{"text":"Had a going away party here for 20 of our close friends and WOW we had amazing food, spectacular service and privacy in the beautiful wine cellar rooms downstairs. They have an elevator for guests, too.   Anyone looking for a place for a private party should definitely check out Sierra Bonita Grill!   We will miss their delicious food and great customer service when we move out of state!"}
{"text":"Had a Wednesday dinner with my wife at SBG. My experience was mixed. I ordered a Rob Roy(Manhattan with Scotch instead of Rye) from the bar. The bartender omitted the bitters which irked me a bit. A high end bar should make the drink with bitters. This is basic bartending 101. We ordered the green chile Mac & Cheese. It was excellent...mild chili flavor and al dente pasta. For an entrée, I ordered the SBG signature burger. This burger was executed fine, but the design is just terrible. The amount of chorizo in the grind is way too much. All you can taste is the chorizo so you cannot enjoy the egg, green chile, cheddar and brioche. I could not eat the burger. It was that bad. Fries were fine, but not memorable. The bartenders never came back to our table to see if we were happy with our meals which really made the evening a miss."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is spectacular. Had cowboy hash. Yum, but service from this bartender when you're a couple & not 2 women was less than satisfactory."}
{"text":"This is a cool place and a somewhat unexpected location. I've been here three times and the food has been great every time. I love the look and feel - rustic/retro and interesting menu choices. Get the green chili beef stew!"}
{"text":"I have to fess up to something... I have been here several times and have only ordered on entree on the menu. I know I need to branch out, but when you have had a tough day and all you crave is good solid comfort food, why switch it up (there is always next time!) The only negative is the tight parking where I always end up in a dark alley.  So the one menu item that has me all worked up? The Roasted \"Free Range\" Chicken. It is AMAZING... A-MAZ-ING. It is good for my soul. It comes with what the menu states is \"creamy\" polenta, which is serious like the best mash ever. Along with the veggies and an entire half of a chicken that is seasoned to perfection, you can't go wrong. I always leave stuffed and satisfied.  I guess I will have to branch out and try other menu items and report back to my yelping friends of course."}
{"text":"I visited a couple of times without being terribly impressed - the prices are pretty high compared to similar restaurants in the area.  But then I discovered their carne asada taco, and now I can't wait to go back.  There really are no words for how good it is."}
{"text":"Always love the food at Sierra Bonita but recently placed an order for pickup and did not receive one of our ordered items... dessert! Unfortunately, we didn't notice until we were home but the food was filling enough anyway."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. I gave it a 5 for the stacked enchiladas. My partner stretched his rating up to a 1 because they had egg whites for his $12.00 breakfast. His potatoes and bacon were previously cooked and then added to the plate cold. They had no jam to spread on the lard-buttered toast. Service was fast."}
{"text":"I posted a 5 star prior and now am down grading my review. I was there today for lunch, and the power went out. Their computer was not working, and the place was pretty empty. We asked about paying cash or card and they new the prices of the two cokes and two sandwiches.. but they were going to run the ticket later so they could calculate and add the tax to the credit card ( here is a hint, when things go wrong, you just make the customers a deal, or offer a gift card). The music was way too loud, felt the old Hard Rock Café. I just feel like money comes first and customer relationships come 2nd. I will give it another at some point, but there are too many Four star places to eat it will take time before we go back."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Sierra Bonita- ordered the pork chile, salmon, and mac and cheese. I asked our server for extra spicy and he took care of everything. He made sure we had everything we needed and the food was impeccable.   Thank you! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Delish!  Can't say enough about their BUTTERMILK PIE!  Yum!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally tried this place for dinner and we are both so glad we did!    We sat at the bar, which had an adequate number of seats and a few high top tables. It is clear this joint is well loved by their regulars! Everyone at the bar knew the staff and were all generous. The bartenders were great! They knew the menu, had suggestions and were super nice.   This place has fantastic happy hour! Delicious margaritas and a bunch of yummy appetizers such as the Guacamole with salsa and chips and the street tacos. For an entree, I had the southern salad served with poblano ranch...sooo good!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm going to do a 2 for 1 review. I went here last Friday for lunch and had the steak sandwich special and it was really good. So I thought why not go back today for lunch. I ordered the guacamole burger and my lunch date ordered the beef stew. First they served me a moldy piece of lettuce on the burger and the burger tasted like shit. Second the beef stew looked and was actually worse than dog food. The meat was so tough that when I tried it it took me at least a minute to swallow one piece. So I guess this place is gonna be one of those hit or miss type restaurants. If the food was more consistent I would probably eat here at least once a week, now I'll probably avoid Sierra Bonita like the plague. $40 for lunch and crap food is unacceptable!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for at least  2 years .. we love  the food and always enjoy the atmosphere. I bring all my family anytime they are in town. We were here last weekend trying to celebrate a friends bday. They used to have bottomless mimosas and we were so happy! Then they stopped it... then we asked and they accommodated us. We went again and they had the bottomless mimosa back on! We live 30 minutes away by freeway ... we looked it up and then we called and were told yes ... we lyfted there because we don't drink and drive .... We got there and were rudely told no bottomless. we then asked someone else and were told yes .... our waiter seemed annoyed and like a kid went and told his manager . The manager then interrupted our conversation and without an apology told us no. if it hadn't been because we had lyfted here and were still waiting on another friend ,we would have got up and left. When our food arrived - two of us had ordered carne asada tacos and the meat was cold. I ordered the special which was the monte cristo which I was expecting to be crispy but was very soggy. our waiter seemed just unfriendly and annoyed that we were even there, if it wasn't for us putting our plates in a pile he would have never picked them up. I love Chelsea but sadly we will not be coming  here nor suggesting this place again. Also maybe they should change their advertisement ."}
{"text":"All i can say is DELICIOUS!! Everything i have had here is so good. they have a great selection of drinks and a variety of menu items for what ever you may be in the mood for. you cant beat their happy hour of 1/2 off apps and drink specials. their jalapeno app is amazing. the bartender makes great drinks including the \"Kenny Margarita\" this is to die for. it states on the menu \"limit is two\" that should give you an idea of how potent they are. the service is always friendly and quick.   I recently went for dinner and had their carne asada entree and it became my new favorite thing on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. If the guys I was riding with didnt point it out I think I would have missed it. Its right on the corner of 7th street and glendale just shy of the light.   We ordered the guacamole/chips appetizer and it was very good. It was gone within minutes...  I had the green chili burger since I have never had one. I know Im a native and I have never tried this before? Whhhaaaa? It was very good. Everything was cooker perfectly and tasty. I do like green chilis so this was just something I had to jump in and try. Around the table we had the mahi mahi tacos, and the suaza enchilladas, and a cup of the azteca soup. Everything came out good and everyone liked what they ate.  Waitresses were on the spot. Originally I thought they kept checking us out, but unfortunately they were after refills on our drinks. You can see their heads pop up and stare over at the table for a minute... It was kind of amusing for a few minutes...   Someone told me this place is owned by the Phoenix City grill as well. ..  I would go back again. It was about $60 with tax/tip/drink for 3 at lunch."}
{"text":"Got lunch with my buddy ... Food was good just lacked customer service... Place was empty and so you would think you going to get service... I guess you need a polo or collar shirt... Well what ever I'll be back .."}
{"text":"There is an extensive  menu. Prices are high for lunch. Place is larger than it looks. Staff was friendly. We were seated on the left side of the restaurant. I tried the green chili stew.  It could have been a lot hotter. Also tried the Mac and cheese .and the quesadilla.  Food was good"}
{"text":"The prices here have gone up and the portion sizes and food quality have suffered.  That compared with increased competition makes this place lower on the list.  $26 buttermilk chicken was a rip off today.  One breast with mushy breading, some gravy/sauce, a mashed sweet potato and 5 or 6 asparagus spears is too much.  My $14 old fashioned tasted mostly of ginger ale.  The staff is still very good, but we have been coming less and will continue to decrease our patronage.  This used to be our once or two per week go to."}
{"text":"Working in the Hayden Ferry Lakeside biz complex on Tempe Town Lake, there is no shortage of people trying to sell us lunch. We have options on Mill, the cafe in the complex, food trucks, pop-ups, and all the usual delivery services. Still, it is always welcome when the company decides to buy us some food.  Today, we were the lucky recipients of Sierra Bonita Grill's new(ish) catering service. They showed up early and were set up on time. The buffet line was well-organized (which is helpful when attracting a herd of hungry co-workers) and the food was warm (noteworthy, because not everyone seems to be able to pull this off) and the staff was friendly. The succulents they used as table decorations were a nice touch!  Our buffet had tomatillo chicken, smoked red chile pork, charro beans, charred tomato rice, and what-tasted-like-homemade tortillas. A beautiful display of probably the most decadent fudge brownies you might ever taste rounded out the line (word to the wise -- take small bites).  All of the food was good, but seriously, when I die, please put a take-out container of the smoked red chile pork in my coffin with me - you know, just in case. It was THAT GOOD.   We're already bugging our managers to order from them again. As soon as possible."}
{"text":"I have driven by Sierra Bonita a million times while doing business in Central Phoenix and kept saying to myself: \"Self: -gotta try it.\"  Now I am pretty upset with myself that it took so long. Note to other reviewers: this is not a Mexican restaurant. It is not fast food. It's a Southwestern dinner house......warm, welcoming, and comfortable. We are still talking about our evening and intend to take the entire family back for an event soon. (cant wait).  Our service was stellar, and I am sorry I don't remember her name. She was so friendly and had a great personality....never acted like she was in a hurry. She had great drink and Tequila suggestions. The drinks were fresh and strong. We ordered the red chili Mac and cheese appetizer - which was a very liberal portion for two people. My husband's eyes rolled back in his head and he not only polished off every bite....his finger finished off the sauce left in the pan. For my entree, I ordered the stuffed Poblano - also an appetizer, but it was perfect. It is served in a small skillet on very flavorful refried beans and really GOOD homemade tortillas......nice, large, and stretchy......just like Abuelita made them. My husband had the red chili pork roast and loved it.....great, smoky flavor. We had such a nice dinner that we stepped over to compliment the gentleman at the door, who turned out to be the owner......really a nice, charming guy. I love it when the owner of the place acts like he is hosting a party and having a good time himself  - and that was my impression. When we told him where we live, he was surprised. Heck, we would drive twice the distance.....and we will as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"First timer to S.M. and proud to say I will return! Very nice atmosphere, really enjoyed the ambiance and friendly staff. Food was hot and delicious, and prices were decent. Overall a very pleasant time and would recommend it  Recommendations: chips and guac are a must! They are also known for the \"butter milk chicken\""}
{"text":"Dinner has always been terrific.  Been here a 1/2 dozen times.  Always have a good time at dinner.  Happy hour thought?  Had a puzzling poor happy hour experience, drinks and food weren't good.  Can't figure out if it was an off day or they just phone it in during happy hour."}
{"text":"Good afternoon all,   We had a really good time at Sierra Bonita.  It truly lived up to its name of being a Southwestern experience.  It is a medium sized restaurant, very intimate and cozy.  The lighting is inviting, the people were friendly and the food was really delicious.  We also had a really great turn out for the event as well.     My Review of Sierra Bonita Grill   Sierra Bonita Grill really impressed me.  They have original menu items and have a lot of great choices on their HH menu.  Our 2 favorites were their Frito pie and their Green Chile pork.  Both were truly flavorful and delicious.  So much so that we ordered them twice.  The Guacamole and Queso dip were close seconds.  The drinks were good, not as good as other places I've been, but still enjoyable.  They actually have a really great house red wine on their HH menu which is rare considering most wines on HH menus aren't the best.  I had their margarita, but I found it to be too sweet for my taste, although others who love sweet drinks (Nina) probably would love it.  After they re-made it with less agave, it was more tart which is more to my style.  I generally try to avoid sugar and prefer more natural sweet flavor from fresh squeezed fruits.  Their pomegranate margarita also got great comments from Shara and that their Sangria was also really good.  I would definitely recommend going back there for a meal or HH.  I like trying out places before bringing Anthony, because he can be less open for experimenting.  This place made the list, I'll definitely bring him there for one of our date nights."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The carne asada is amazing. Get a mojito while you're here they are seriously the best in the city. Parking can be tight but trust me it's worth it. 10/10 would recommend and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The service was impeccable. Fron the hostess to Jose, our waiter and everyone in between they made sure we had everything we needed. The food was delicious and plenty. Will be back."}
{"text":"I have been going to SBG since they opened in 2005.  They have changed the menu a little bit, but it is still an awesome place to dine.  I was on yelp and decided to use their reservation option and it was so easy.  When we got there, we had no problem, however we decided we wanted to sit at the bar, we always like to chat with the bartenders.  Tom was really nice and very personable.  He recommended a great red blend and my hubby of course had his margarita on the rocks.  We started with the quesadillas to share as our appetizer, very nice.  I had the Enchiladas Suizas as my entree and my hubby had a chile relleno and the Azteca Soup.  Of course, he had some of my dish, too.  The guests sitting next to us tempted us with the dessert, so we ordered the bread pudding, wow, just like I like it.  SO YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Great atmosphere and nice place to gather with a small group of people. Excellent appetizers and the Mexican food was top notch."}
{"text":"Tonight I tasted the second best stake My tastebuds have ever had the pleasure to enjoy, the name of the dish,Cowboy Steak most flavorful Ribeye  you will ever enjoy.  Pan Seared Grouper dos not fail to top the charts itself. Both dishes came with sautéed vegetables and were laid out very elegantly for ones viewing pleasure before devouring the yummyness which awaits them."}
{"text":"Took my wife on a surprise date here! We loved this place. The food was extremely delicious. The green Chile Mac and cheese is one of the best dishes I've had in forever and I strongly recommend! Only thing was, our particular waitress was not the best, but the other employees were fantastic! Will be back!"}
{"text":"One of our go-tos. Chips and trio of salsa-- yum. Fish tacos are great for lunch and so is the vegetable sandwich. Mac and cheese is a great app.  Margs are tasty. Outdoor patio is perfect for a warm spring night. Service is always good. Never had a meal we didn't like."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the bomb.   We had an awesome meal.  Didn't care for waiting 30 minutes to get a table, but it was well worth it.   We will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Tried SBG last weekend for brunch and have been thinking about that meal ever since. Two words come to mind: absolutely delicious. Started off with an agua fresca (pineapple-mint), an iced tea and the mini quesadillas. The quesadillas were a fabulous start to the meal; followed that with the veggie omelet. OMG that thing was huge! Inside there was a delicious mix of calabacitas, veggies and cheese. The veggie hash that was served alongside was a great compliment. My dining partner had the huevos rancheros and loved it as it wasn't served the traditional way. SBG uses fried tortillas as the base and loads them up with eggs, guac, etc. making a sort of \"huevos tostada\" so to speak. Anyways, definitely worth checking out sometime if you haven't stopped in yet!"}
{"text":"Great find Via the yelp app.  Are server/bartender was awesome.  The food was great and I recommend the carne asada tacos and the pork ossobucco."}
{"text":"First time dining here and all I have to say is WOW! This is hands down best restaurant I have ate in the valley so far.  The buttermilk chicken entree will melt in your mouth.  The queso fundido dip is very delicious along with the mouth watering fish tacos.  In addition to the outstanding food, the service was top notch as well! I highly recommend Sierra Bonita and will make a return trip very soon."}
{"text":"Sooooo good and a great find for New Mexico Chile! Pomegranate margaritas were amazing and the green Chile Mac and cheese was everything we imagined. Recommend the stacked enchiladas with an egg on top. Service was prompt and extremely friendly. Thanks!"}
{"text":"If you come inside you think they must specialize in fancy street tacos or fajitas, but I am telling you that the absolute best thing on the menu is the Buttermilk Chicken. Fried Chicken, mashed sweet potatoes, and a pepper-y gravy. I would say that it tastes like Thanksgiving but I've never had anything that good on Thanksgiving before. That is the dish that keeps me coming back and back again."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my husband, my parents, and my in-laws last night! We were fortunate to have dinner in there wine cellar in the basement. It was very intimate with all the wine bottles around our table and candles lit around the room. Four of us ordered the famous Chocolate Espresso rubbed pork tenderloin which definitely lived up to its reputation. Very flavorful and savory! My mother ordered the Buttermilk Chicken with sweet potatoes and it was a great down home cooking, stick to your ribs dish that you would remember from home. The green chile stew was my husbands favorite. It had a slight kick to it, but was very tender with the perfect blend of spices.   Our server was fantastic and had great wine and menu recommendations. Which we followed and were not disappointed. If you are looking for authentic Southwestern cuisine this is the place!"}
{"text":"I forgot just how amazing this place is!  I had visited for dinner nearly 10 years ago and hadn't been back since...what was I thinking?  We stopped in for Sunday brunch and love the rustic and relaxed atmosphere, fantastic service and amazingly flavorful food.  I enjoyed the stacked enchilada special with red chile pork and a pineapple agua fresca...seriously amazing way to start the morning!"}
{"text":"Awesome weekend brunch, best bloody marys, wonderful staff & service. They have a really good happy hour during the week too. This is my \"Cheers.\""}
{"text":"Just dined at Sierra Bonita again, and felt the need to jot a few notes.  First, Liz has been my server the last three times I've been there.  Keep up the good work, and note to manangement:  Keep Liz!  but you already know that.  she has the rare ability to make you feel well attended to, yet doesn't overdo it.  she has a genuine unfaked warmth and remembers everyone's names! today I tried the green corn tamale appetizer and the Five Spice Chicken sandwich, with a side salad.  the tamale is very good, hearty, moist and flavorful with a green chile sauce.  it is much better than its boring tex-mex counterpart you'd get at your typical Mexican place.  the sandwich is a very flavorful, marinated chicken breast, seared to crispiness, with bacon and some Mexican cheese over the top, with a flavored mayo not only adding a lot of savor to the sandwich but keeping it moist as well.  I'm too full to finish it but finish it I do, because it's that tasty.  Try Sierra Bonita, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Tried this place as we live near here.  I'm a Pozole connessueir and addict, so naturally, I ordered the Pozole.  It was not good.  I would say of all the Pozoles I've ever had, this is last on the list, it was bland, not spicy, no condiments or tortilla. Here is my list of top 3 best Pozoles in order: 1. Arribas 2. Richardsons 3. Barrio Urbano"}
{"text":"I recently went to Sierra Bonita for a really delicious brunch. I've been in the mood lately for biscuits and gravy and this place made my afternoon with a fantastic southwestern version named Verde Vaqueros. The salty sausage gravy was just about perfect and generously poured over each biscuit. The biscuits were also served with some scrambled eggs and a couple strips of bacon that were light and tasted very fresh.   I also got to try the guacamole, tamale app and a few bites of the stacked enchiladas. They were all very very good. The guac was a perfect blend of ripe avocados, diced onion, cilantro and a little lime juice; the serving size wasn't to shabby either. The tamale app was just a single tamale, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that is really hungry and would like to spend $5 more wisely. Finally, the enchilada... It was wonderful and with a fried egg nest on top, it was perfecto. The chicken, the tortillas, the beans and the cheese came together to make an excellent southwestern flavor.  Sierra Bonita was great for brunch and I'm excited to go back at another time of day to hopefully have a similar experience."}
{"text":"The portions have gotten way smaller ,, not the best waiter ,, not sure I would go back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, decent atmosphere, good location, food was good, prices a tad high for lunch, service was good. I'll be back...four stars."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Happy Hour places. The best Margaritas in Phoenix hands down and the Sangria is great as well. The Green Chile is amazing, as are the Street Tacos, Fried Chicken and pretty much everything on the menu. Great ambiance and excellent service."}
{"text":"The food is awesome!!!!  Love the buttermilk chicken and mashed sweet potatoes!  One of the best places to eat in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have been here at least a dozen times and will keep coming back.  The last time i was there I had the Cowboy Stew and it was delicious.  The Margarita Chingon also packs a punch if that's your thing, i enjoyed it as well as the Azteca soup.  I also recommend going for brunch.  The brunch menu offers a number of unique choices that will keep you busy for a while.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Good food, some really good...  Very cool place.  Outstanding buttermilk pie for dessert.  I've heard the brunch is great, but haven't been yet, but will soon.  Had a great green chili burger the other day."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I always get the pozole. It's so flavorful and even having plenty of mexican dishes in my family Sierras is my fave!! All the food is really tasty & the vibe here is nice too. Even a little eye candy I won't complain. The male servers are quite attractive"}
{"text":"Special tonight was $38 prime rib with green Chile mashed potatoes. Potato's were awesome, with a small kick, but the prime rib was half fat...seriously, it was so full of fat, I could only eat half. I've hear some good things, totally not impressed. The service was very good and the atmosphere was nice...a solid 3."}
{"text":"Happy Hour - Should be Nominated for WORST in Phoenix Business/Upscale Lunch - Good Upscale Dinner - Good to Great Brunch - Great to Fabulous  Happy Hour:  In a town of outstanding Happy Hours, this one sucks.  Small plates, too high of prices not discounted much from full price, expensive drinks, small portions.    I couldn't believe it when I ordered a $4 draft beer for Happy Hour and it came in a 8 ounce cup.  Maybe 10 ounces.  What the hell?  I mean, seriously.  Everyone serves beer in pints nowadays, don't they?  My second happy hour here... won't be fooled again.  Meet me at St. Francis, down the road, any day of the week.  Lunch:  Much like their dinner, but understandably smaller portions on many sizes, but fair prices for upscale lunch.  This is a great business lunch spot if you want to share with someone from out of town the southwest, but not Mexican food experience.  Or a ladies lunch.  Or a date lunch.  Whatever... you get my point.  Expect to talk out with a bill around $20 with tip for typical entree and iced tea.  Dinner:  In a age when every restaurant is lowering prices or at least staying current, the owner jacked up the prices recently on everything on the menu.  The fact that it's still packed every weekend night with long lines says that he's doing something right, and who can blame him for trying to coin it?  Outstanding dishes you can't go wrong with:  Jalepenos with Cheese Baked Appetizer ($10)- as long as you can stand just a little heat, this will be a crowd pleaser.  Even my older kids love them.    Stuffed Pepper Appetizer ($7) - kind of hard to share... Giant home made tortilla, with a large baked pepper in a bed of \"canned\" like refried beans.  But inside the pepper, delicious blend of meat, potato and cheese.  Could be  dinner item fro someone with a very, very light appetite.  Chicken Sandwich ($13) - honestly, this is the best chicken sandwhich I've ever had, at any restaurant, anywhere.  Grilled marinated chicken has just the right heat, bun is tasty, loaded with fresh toppings.  I get the chile mashed potatoes as a side, to die for.  But you can also get the Azteca soup, another standout, as your side.  Also available on Lunch menu.  Signature Pork Loin ($21) - not a ton of food, just right to finish your plate, but the meat is to die for, and the veggies in butter sauce are terrific.  Just one of those meals you could have 2x per week for the rest of your life.    Trout ($23) - see above - if you like fish, try the above.  Dessert - Bread Pudding ($7) - easily enough to share among 2, 3 if you you show restraint.  Rich, filling dessert that tastes great.  Bread pudding made from croissants or some such, with creamy sugar sauce poured over it.  Dishes to avoid:  Ceviche (not worth the price), Guacamole (chips suck, Gauc is bland, salsas just okay, $9), fish tacos (they flatly suck).  Brunch - It's cheap, still outstandingly great food, few crowds.  I'm sure they'll jack up the prices when it gets busy, but this is the way to enjoy this restaurant if you are on a budget.  You can easily get away with $15 after tip if you are careful, and get to soak up the great ambiance, good food, etc.   Service - Service can be slightly poor here.  Just lower your expectations in advance, and you'll then be pleasantly surprised.   I could easily have rated this 4 stars.  I've eaten here 20-25 times over the last 3 years.  I like it... but it does have some flaws, per above.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing!    We arrived 15 minutes before they opened and the host happily opened the door, got us seated and invited us to water and a menu while the kitchen finished setting up.  The wait staff is fantastic!  Friendly, knowledgable and patient.  Food was amazing!  I had the pozole and it was out of this world with flavor.  My friend had Cowboy Hash and was in love!  We had to order a side of the biscuits and gravy (a special order - not the full order just 2 biscuits and gravy - the waitress was friendly and accommodating!).  Since it was Sunday morning . . . we were daring and had the bloody Mary's!  OMG!  Very tasty - not all tomato juice or spicy - just perfectly flavored!  We'll be back again this week!    Spread the word about this local gem!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we dined at SBG and decided we will not wait so long between visits. The food is consistently delicious and the staff is friendly and attentive, but not hovering. We started with a round of drinks (nice variety of options) and an appetizer of the bacon wrapped shrimp - beautifully presently and perfect portion size for a party of four.   All of the entree's were wonderful. The burgers are huge, juicy and cooked to perfections. The Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast garnered 5 stars in and of itself as did the chocolate-espresso rubbed pork tenderloin. Yum! The red chile glazed chicken was also a hit. All of the dishes are wonderfully prepared and pleasantly presented.  SBG used to be owned by the same owners of Phoenix City Grille. Great to find out that the split didn't impact the quality of food or service. If you've been thinking about trying SBG, don't hesitate. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food , good service, buttermilk chicken is really good. Little pricy for what you get but overall three stars"}
{"text":"Hate to rate this on the lower end but margaritas were weak and served in cheap plastic but glass looking cups and even with happy hour price not worth it....the 3 tacos i had were decent but the meat was rubbery, felt like i was chewing forever. The nachos we ordered barely had beans and no cheese i guess..the drizzle of beans were like from a can of baked beans or something sweeter. Idk. Glad we didnt decide to pay oustide of happy hour prices. The ambiance is nice but  akward layout i imagine it gets really crowded on a busy evening..i would come back but only for happy hour and only if i was in the area and only if i was entertaining some visitors as it a quaint nastalgic overprised little spot, in my opinion anyway."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out.  Nice atmosphere...service was good...but the food wasn't really my taste.  I had the Red Chile Pork.  The spices seemed off.  It is a simple dish by appearance, but the taste doesn't deserve the best selling dish label that the bartender said it had.  To add...it's $27.00?!?!  I'll try coming back again as I have friends say this is a great place to eat.  Maybe just cocktails and happy hour food next time"}
{"text":"I can handle bad service on a busy night... I can deal with bad service when the wait staff is new... I can deal with it when the place first opens... but when the place is dead and the waiter has been around for a while.... (record scratch) turn down the Katy Perry music... I get mad!  The food was AWESOME and I love the ambiance at Sierra Bonita but the Waiter could have cared less that we were there. I have news for him and the other employees he was sitting with when we left... NOT IN THIS ECONOMY buddy!  I'll go back because of the other reviews and I did enjoy the food but no thanks to our waiter."}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday brunch. This place had some pretty incredible dishes. Very unique mixture of classic American brunch items and the Southwestern influence.   This place I could see would be a great neighborhood gathering place. It's not pretentious in anyway, and if I lived in Phoenix, I could see myself here a couple of times a month.   I ordered the Cowboy hash and it did not disappoint. It was a rather large dish and If I had not come in starving there definitely would have been leftovers. I really enjoyed the vegetables in the dish and of course the fried eggs on top were a great addition. Nothing better than runny yolk over a smattering of vegetables and chorizo. I tried my friends Azteca soup as well and wished I would ordered it myself! I doubt I would have had room though in my stomach."}
{"text":"Biggest complaint first.  No chips and Salsa.  Ok.  So I agree to pay $9.00 for guacamole.  \"Made in Molcajete\" ... maybe so - don't know because it's not served that way.  I DO know that when the bowl came out, there was some liquid forming around the bottom of the scoop of flavorless guacamole - perhaps from the thawing from the costco bag?  I don't know - but I do know - the replacement scoop didn't have the liquid at first, but as time progressed - it collected.  Yuk.  It wasn't flavorful at all.  If you pay $9 for Guacamole... It best be FRESH FRESH FRESH.  FLAVORFUL!  PLEASE.  The three \"salsas\" on the side were SMALL little ramekins - so small a chip can't dip into it .. you have to break the chip up and just dip - not scoop - the salsa (one of which is Pico de Gallo)  They were ok, but nothing to write home about.  Sorry - but I expect a lot more from these two items at this kind of restaurant.  It's not hard to wow me with salsa and guacamole.  FAIL.  The rest of the meal was pretty good for all three of us, but this just left a bad taste in my mouth.  Bummer."}
{"text":"We happened to run across this place before the Electric Light Parade last week. And I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Atmosphere was awesome. Are server was so sweet the food, out is this world. Carne Assad tacos and my husband had the chorizo burger. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We usually have a great experience at Sierra Bonita. Tonight the service was horrible. Our waitress abandoned us. 30 minutes after delivering the food she came back to see if everything was OK,...a little late...The restaurant was mostly empty, so there really was no excuse. We ordered dessert and waited another half hour...After calling the manager, who did try to comp the meal for us ( but we paid anyway)...the waitress did show up and had the nerve to say the service was fine...it was the kitchen's fault....hopefully they will fire her, because she is a major blemish on an otherwise good restaurant."}
{"text":"Im writing this review for a friend who doesn't get on the internet! He went there the other night with his partner and when he received his food he found a 1 inch bolt in his dish!! He informed the waiter and all they did was give him a new meal and said that it was on the house! They brought a pudding out thinking it made everything better and charged  them for everything else!"}
{"text":"The venue has a lovely mystic and very friendly atmosphere!  Our server was attentive and knew her wines well.    The food was fresh and delicious.  I enjoyed the bacon wrapped shrimp, as my starter, and shared the grilled North Central chicken.  All very good.    Atmosphere great for a cozy meal with good friends, delicious  food (Tad bit spicy) and excellent service!  Would highly recommend it to any foody!"}
{"text":"Get the fundito"}
{"text":"I know I love a place when I immediately start planning my next visit and  planning who I am bringing there, when I am walking to the parking lot.  For my dear good friend's birthday  I wanted to bring her somewhere  she would find memorable.  And the night was. From the moment we walked up the aromas engaged the senses. We all smiled at each other knowing we had come to the right place.  The hostess was very friendly, nice and picked up that we were celebrating a bday. She even remembered the birthday as we walked out , nice touch.   We were seated promptly and quickly got drinks and chips with guacamole started . The guacamole was super yummy and hit the spot and  chips were fresh. After much deliberation we all ended up ordering the same thing --  buttermilk chicken .  I had remembered Iain 's description and I  wanted to try it .  It did not disappoint . Moist, unique tasting , like a fried chicken but not . It tasted like something a really hip Texas grandma might make if she had gone to culinary school.  The sauce served along was over top yummy. Served with it was a generous  peppered mashed sweet potato which was good but was a bit too peppery in some tastes .  I would love it again just toned down a smidgen.  The waitress brought a nice chocolate  brownieish \"cup\" with ice cream for the birthday girl . Sweet.  Just a note that parking can be tricky , you may have to park on the street o drive around to find a spot. But it's so worth it."}
{"text":"Found something in my food here. No one apologized and the manager actually told me that it wasn't a big deal. We had to fight to not pay for our food. Seems to me like this happens often here. I will not be returning and would never recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I don't think my experience was typical, and they were having an off night at Sierra Bonita Grill.  Normally cuisine is very well prepared, but when I got my enchiladas they were cold and watery.  The guac was already kinda browning after a minute or two at the table, which made it unpaletable.  For the price, I would expect better.  I will still give them another shot, their service is always great."}
{"text":"The food here is always excellent.  One of our favorite places to go for special occasions."}
{"text":"The insider scoop is they have Happy Hour 7 days a week. Yes, even on Sundays. Hoegarden on tap and on special. The jalapeno poppers are very unique and are a MUST. They come on like a cool molten hot fajita cast iron skillet thing....just get em."}
{"text":"What a great find on my last visit to phoenix.  Searched from somthing close to the hotel and BAM .....here it is. My wife had chicken pasta and I was in a mood for a burger. My wife simply loved the pasta and I had one of the best burgers of my life. Service was exceptional without compare. If you get a chance you must stop and try it."}
{"text":"went here for dinner Saturday night - was the least crowded I've ever seen it and got right in for a late bite. Delicious trout. That's right - trout. It was yummy and healthy."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE FOOD.  The service is amazing, the fresh-squeezed margarita is my favorite, and the atmosphere is cozy.  Sierra Bonita accommodated a huge group of us and everything was perfect.  It's a wonderful spot, you won't regret going."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise. Was not expecting much but the staff was friendly and the food was good. Very much a mexican style southwest cafe. Not a huge amount to eat for kids or vegetarians but overall a good option when nearby."}
{"text":"Happy Hour, Happy Hour, Happy Hour!   I cannot stress this point enough! A friend and I got 5 appetizers, 2 sangrias, and a slice of buttermilk pie for $35!   Menu highlights:   The chips and guacamole: This appetizer comes with three side salsas and a big helping of the smoothest guac ever! The chips are perfect as well!   Buttermilk Pie: You will die when you taste this, I literally want to lick the plate after I've finished the pie.   The mac and cheese (the actual name escapes me): Green chili cheese and noodles, need I say more?   Sangria: I consider myself a bit of a sangria connoisseur, and they have some of the best I've tasted.   The atmosphere isn't bad with the dim lighting and all, but I could do without all the Arizona nature porn on the wall. But for cowboy chic food what can you expect?"}
{"text":"I've ordered food to go, a margarita on the rocks at the bar, and had brunch on a Sunday. Each experience was well above average.  When I stopped in for a drink, it was a Friday during happy hour and packed! Still got my drink promptly, and I enjoyed it so much I had to repeatedly remind myself I had plans that I would not be able to show up to in a cab.  I ordered the chicken sandwich and tortilla soup to go and I would definitely get it again.  When I went for brunch with the bf, I got the enchilada stack with chicken, my egg was perfectly cooked over medium, and the Desert Blossom iced tea really hit the spot. My bf had the burger with cheddar cheese and fries. It was so good I wanted to trade even though mine was delicious. Just the right amount of salt on the fries, and the burger was as good as I'd heard!  Our waitress was attentive, always bringing us more iced tea and anything else we needed, she was personable and really made our whole experience a very positive one. We look forward to going back again and again. There are many more menu items I am dying to try!! I really like the ambiance- dark and relaxing at night, bright and cozy during the day.  Thanks Kari M. for telling me about this great restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Sierra Bonita Grill after only one visit.  We went during restaurant week, so I could try more things.  And let me tell you, the amount of food we got for the price was ridiculous.  Ridiculous in a good way.  My starter was the chips & guacamole with 3 salsas.  I judge heavily by chips & salsa and theirs passed with flying colors.  My husband had the shrimp ceviche.  I should say \"we\" had the shrimp ceviche as there was easily enough for two.  It, too, was delicious.  HIs entree was the carne asada.  I did not try, but he commented the steak was seasoned nicely and not overdone for a change.  I had the green chile pork roast which was chucks of perfectly tender pork in a spicy, but not too hot, green chile sauce.  For dessert he had the buttermilk pie, and I can't remember mine, because his was better.  I hate when that happens.  And I almost forgot the best part....the tortillas!!!  While not Carolina's, these are a little thicker and really, really good with the little toasty brown spots from being warmed over an open flame.  It was so good, I purposely saved half to eat with my leftovers.  But our server was so awesome that when he boxed up my food and I asked him to please include my tortilla, he gave me a brand new one, too!  Yeah, he got an extra big tip for that.  If I were closer, SBG would be a weekly destination, but it's definitely on my return list.  And did I tell you I LOVE it?"}
{"text":"We had a party of 12 on a Saturday night. Seating was quick. Service not so much. My wife ordered the $36 steak, pretty pricey for this place. Completely unseasoned. Just bland. We only had one person waiting on the whole table. Poor girl was overwhelmed. She did her best, that was the most positive thing from this experience. After getting the bill, of course the gratuity was already added on. We know thats expected in a large group, so we asked to speak to a manager. Not one working on a Saturday night. Really? The person in charge came from behind the bar and gave us some uncalled for attitude. We had to ask her to leave our table. Very unprofessional. We asked for a card for the manager, called and couldn't reach anybody. We won't be going back ever. Good luck to the rest of you going there."}
{"text":"Run for your life!!!  Much better choice,  Phoenix City Grille!!  Big difference on how you are treated and respected."}
{"text":"Have driven past this place a thousand times (give or take) so when I saw a living social deal, I snapped it up.  Came to dinner on a Sunday night.  I ordered the Miguel's something-or-other. Like a moscow mule, but... not? Any rate, it was quite good. We started with the Hoppers, which were really tasty and not crazy hot jalapenos with cheese on a hot skillet then broiled.  Bf had the burger, which he loved. They mix their chuck with chorizo.  I had the trout which was really good, though I normally do not order farm raised fish.  For dessert we shared the croissant bread pudding, which was really good. I'd give this place more stars but our server was really not at all friendly. I'd tell you his name, but he never told us, and I never asked. Service was FINE. not bad by any means. Attentive. But seriously. Customers like it when you have a smile on your face and dont look like you hate life. I'd blame it on the Living Social voucher (aaaand I never forget to tip on the full amount!) , but I never mentioned I had one until he dropped off the check, I left it in the book with my credit card."}
{"text":"We both tried the pozole and thought it was so-so.  Decent.  3-stars.  The guacamole dip was very good though."}
{"text":"When growing up I loved to watch TV.  I was the chubby kid so going outside and playing wasn't much in my vocabulary as I was always taken away to a fantasyland of programming that would appeal to me so.  Inevitably you'd see reruns of all the beloved favorites, I Dream of Jeanie, Bewitched and Wild Wild West.  But there was one rerun that really caught my eye, Bonanza.  It's not that I liked Westerns or anything like that; it was because I loved looking at the cast.  Those tight jeans clad Cartwright brothers were the dreams of young raging hormones and many afternoons of happy time.    After happy time I would always be ready for something to eat.  Food would almost certainly ease the loneliness of growing up the chubby kid, where is that wall of man Hoss Cartwright when a kid needs a hug?  I know where he was at; probably back up at the ranch house making something to eat! Sierra Bonita Grill, it's like that ranch house.  Low hanging ceilings with exposed wooden rafters and a wonderfully smoky just used fireplace smell, you'd think those Cartwright brothers would saunter in at any moment.   Sierra Bonita is the sister restaurant of the fantastic Phoenix City Grille, which also seems to pay homage to Arizona and the old west with its styling and menu selections.  Sierra is just more into the cowboy thing with the sort of cowboy chic and down home friendliness but not enough to be cheesy and contrived.  Outdoors there is a wonderfully cozy patio area for complete with fans for the warmer evenings.  I'm looking forward to cooler temperatures later this year so I can bask in the glowing heat of their gorgeous fireplace.   There isn't much of a better way to get settled into your evening than with one of Sierra Bonita Fresh Squeezed Margaritas ($8).  These tart and heavily liquored versions will take the edge off of any bad day you might have been having.  I make a mean margarita at home so when I say I love these margaritas it really means a whole lot, it's the fresh juice!   After easing into your margarita, looking over the menu will be more of a challenge since everything sounds pretty good.  Like those Cartwright brothers, they sure make them big at Sierra Bonita. The portions are pretty large so be warned when ordering, big eaters will rejoice as I did when the first plates went down.   Fresh seems to be more of a way of life than simply a word.  The Guacamole ($9) embodies the word in its wonderful bright green color and just smashed taste.  If you've never had fresh guacamole before this version is a great way to bust your cherry, so to speak.  The accompanied 3 salsas were all very flavorful including a roasted chile flecked smoky salsa, a fresh chopped pico de gallo and a tangy tomatillo.  The large salty thick cut tortilla chips were sturdy and crisp enough to hold up to scooping chunks of avocado and tomato, scrumptious.   Mini Quesadillas ($7) are a plate of 3 small corn tortillas filled with spinach, cheese and huitlacoche.  The huitlacoche aka corn smut, is actually a fungus that grows on corn and is widely viewed as a delicacy, I think you either love or hate it.  The taste is earthy in a good mushroom kind of way but can tend to be slightly pungent.  In the case of the quesadillas, the flavor was indeed earthy and meshed very well with the other flavors.  Instead of salsa with the quesadilla, they have chosen to serve a delicious black bean and hominy relish.  It's the little choices that seem to make a difference when we're talking about food.   Tacos seem to be on pretty much every menu these days.  They are simple, tasty and easy to make, however all aren't created the same way.  Take the Carne Asada Tacos ($10) for example; the beef is prime and extremely tender though the real difference is the use of pesto mayo, salsa fresca, shredded cabbage and penela cheese for an interesting play on flavors.   When I took my first bite of the Buttermilk Chicken ($17) I was taken back to the time of being a kid and loving my mothers cooking.  Generously seasoned and sublimely tender this is some great chicken.  They lightly pan fry it then finish it in the oven so it's ever so lightly crispy but ever so heavenly.  Included is a pile of mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus spears all slathered in cracked peppercorn gravy just dreamy.     What's a cowboy place without something sweet to finish it all off?  Naturally there is Bread Pudding ($6) but the Buttermilk Pie ($7) seemed like the most unusual choice.  This gamble paid of in spades, the pie was choice! The texture reminded me of a cross between cheesecake and flan with the flavor being something like the later.  The pie is wadding in a pool of caramel sauce that tasted house made and with being so sweet, is meant to be shared.  One bite of the flaky crust and that may not happen.  If you ever have a hunkin' hankerin' for some down home cowboy chow, Sierra Bonita Grill will induce a feeling like happy time with the Cartwright brothers."}
{"text":"Disgusting. People rave about this place and I have never understood why... Last time I was there I got a side of vegetables with my dish and they weren't cooked. Really???"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a Friday with an old boss and boy am I glad we decided on Sierra Bonita! We both had the 5 spice chicken sandwich and fries. While I am not a huge chicken sandwich eater this was perfect! I even went home and talked about this sandwich! It was very juicy (which sometimes can be tricky and can be VERY dry)...the flavor was great. The fries were cooked to a perfect crisp too. It was a great lunch to wrap up a busy work week!"}
{"text":"Went here for Lunch for the 1st time, with a group of people from work, & was thoroughly impressed!  The decor is very nice, but the food was truly unique & delicious! I would like to come here for dinner sometime.  :)"}
{"text":"This is one of our go to, tried and true places. It is a great mix of Tex-mex and comfort food.  We love to sit at the bar for the fantastic happy hour or have a nice dinner at a table. Waitstaff is always great. The food is terrific! The is osso bucco is the best I've had. Tender and so flavorful. The beef stew is fantastic as well as the stacked enchiladas. We love the Hoppers Poppers and bacon wrapped shrimp. The Aztec soup is so flavorful and light. A great light meal with a salad. They have a terrific brunch with bloody Mary's and mimosas. Miguel's Mule, the Paloma and the sangria are all delicious!"}
{"text":"Kim and her staff did an excellent job at our March 21, 2015 wedding. Her staff went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs in our backyard wedding including keeping the candles lit, and the drinks flowing! I received endless comments on how great the food and drinks were---- and I would have to agree.  Thanks again for helping us create such a special, memorable night!  I will 100% plan on using your catering services again and of course we will remain loyal customers at the restaurant!  --Laurie & Bill"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak.  Had a long chat the concierge about the local restaurants.  My favorite North Phoenix restaurants happened to be the same is his (Hana for Sushi, etc).  We wanted top notch meat but are very picky. We refuse to eat grain fed or medicated meat.  He was excited to tell us about Sierra Bonita.  Grass fed, local beef, exceptional flavor, tex-mex etc.    It is a definite top of list choice for anyone visiting Phoneix.  Close to Biltmore and the Pointe hotels.  Close to Downtown.    Everything was excellent.  Service, Food, appetizers, cocktails. Desert-  Bread pudding and chocolate something to die for."}
{"text":"This place never fails to give excellent and friendly service along with unique and quality menu items.    Sierra Bonita remains our favorite and is perfect for and intimate dinner for two or to meet with friends in town and especially out of town visitors. Puts a friendly and welcoming face on Phoenix - in a more traditional and earnest way."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly delicious! When it comes to true authentic mexican taste this place has it!  I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food because I come from a family who's been in the restaurant business for more than 30yrs and I can honestly say this place is everything and more.  The carne asada melts in your mouth, the fundido queso dip is to die for.  My boyfriend ordered the salmon which he thought was average but I tasted the salmon and it was perfect.  I hAd the carne asada tacos A M A Z I N G especially the homemade tortilla.   For dessert we had the chocolate soufflé and it was alright.   Oh and their traditional margarita is awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Customer service is great...   CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My office held their Christmas dinner here and the experience was great from start to finish. Service was efficient and friendly, and the food was outstanding. We all enjoyed a great selection of appetizers, then on to the entrees. Several of us ordered the smoked prime rib with mashed potatoes. I requested shrimp on the side and was more than happy with the four huge grilled shrimp that I received. Others seemed equally happy with their choices and the plates all looked great. The pomegranate margaritas I enjoyed were fantastic as were the desserts we tried. Bread pudding, sorbets and an excellent chocolate soufflé. Next time I will be back on my own dime, but I believe it will be worth every penny !"}
{"text":"where do I start...I have been there now a dozen times and am never disappointed.  Great food-great portions.  We tend to always order the Red Chile Roast even if it's not a dinner entree, it's taken home and mixed with eggs for tasty breakfast burros...seriously 4 meals.  The ceviche is light and fresh, the North Central Chicken is dee-lish, the Pork Osso Buco totally awesome.  Cute patio, great service, kick ass food...and I just heard there is a brunch menu on the weekends...all around win"}
{"text":"Nothing here that will make your tongue tingle with spice.  However I'm updating my update simply to rave about the crossaint bread pudding.  Oh my goodnes, is this incredible.  I love bread pudding and bread pudding made from crossaints is beyond decadent.  (For those of you who visit Luci's try the Wicked Bread pudding which is a great take hom option).  This time I made a meal of small starters.  Scallops were delicious in a bed of quinoa salad (could have used a little more oomph on the salad but good).  The green chili mac and cheese is delicious although I would have preferred more spice.  The huitlacoche quesadillas are delcious and filling.  Overall, a solid four stars."}
{"text":"Great service and quality food. I love the burger or the fish tacos. Guac is also good :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many, many times, esp. since I have the Passport Unlimited card, which gives me the two/one deals.  I've taken out-of-town guests there as well as I've gone with family and friends.  This place cannot be beat.  It isn't what I would consider a Mexican food restaurant, which is what I like about it.    I have never been disappointed in any of the dishes I've tried.  The wait staff is friendly and professional.  The ambience is perfect in the fact one can actually have a conversation without having to talk louder over the din of other diners."}
{"text":"I would double check your reservation just to make sure all is well. Food - service and atmosphere perfect"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Sierra Bonita , I meet 3 other friends there for lunch. The restaurant has a nice feel about it , not noisy like many restaurants I have been in recently. The tables had linens on which was a nice touch. I had a ham sandwich and my friends all had tacos. My sandwich had a nice amount of ham as well as pepper jack cheese. It was nicely grilled and came with fries. I sampled my friends tacos (steak and pork) and they were very good. The steak taco was very tender and the pork has a nice seasoning on it. The prices are a little pricey but well worth it if you want a special night out!"}
{"text":"I have to give HUGE props for the trout here. I am a proud consumer of red meat and do not order fish unless it's shrimp, crab or lobster. That said, I tried the trout here, and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Next time I come here, the Carne Asada be damned (though it too is pretty damn good) I am getting the trout."}
{"text":"Third time here...Many more to come! Had the pork osso bucco, excellent! The pork tenderloin is a must try, unique, super tasty! Parking can be a bit challenging,  complimentary valet a huge plus."}
{"text":"A JUMBO Shrimp with cheese wrapped in bacon. I wish I was eating it right now.   Oh yeah. and all their other food is great too. I love this place."}
{"text":"I was in here this week to meet a client for lunch.  The pozole to start was great.  Fantastic flavors and plenty of chunks of meat.  I was talking so much I didn't get a chance to finish it which was a bummer.  The smoked turkey club was delicious as well.  Turkey breast, green chiles and bacon.  Yum. Yum. Yum.  This cute place really impressed me!"}
{"text":"So we had a wonderful dinner and the wait staff was awesome. The pork osso bucco was huge and everyone at the table thought it was great. Green Chilie Mac and cheese was very awesome too. Both very taste!!!  We will be going back more frequently."}
{"text":"A friend recommended we try Sierra Bonita since it is close to our house, so we decided to stop in for Mother's Day dinner. I first checked Open Table to make reservations and it showed plenty of open tables so I didn't bother to make a reservation and it was only 5:45 pm. When we walked in it didn't appear to be busy and there were at least 7 open tables. There were just 3 of us, but the hostess said that they were booked and we would not be able to be seated until 6:30. When we inquired about eating in the bar area she said we couldn't because we had a kid with us. So I open my Open Table app and I am able to book a reservation on the spot for 6:00.  The hostess still said we couldn't be seated until 6:30. Does this make sense????? Now completely irritated we said it would've been our 1st time and definitely will be our last!!! It is too bad because you just lost a potential \"regular\" customer since we live so close. So we drove down the street to The Yard where oddly enough we were able to sit at the bar and order food with our son and enjoy our Mother's Day..."}
{"text":"i have eten at Sierra Bonita several times.  The food is ALWAYS consistent, and some of the best eating in Phoenix.  The atmosphere is amazing and service is always top notch.  SB has figured out how to be a great neighborhood restaurant with world class food.  The style is southwestern with Mexico City influences - truly amazing."}
{"text":"We were here once before when my friend turned 50 and the gathering was great and the chips/salsa and guacamole were delicious.  So we decided to go back for a meal.  The service was decent but not great.  We sat in the bar on the Sunday during the Masters golf tournament so I asked the bartender to turn it from a movie to the Masters and it took a couple of reminders to have them change it.   Once we got our wine, chips and salsa were delivered and the mild was a lot hotter than we remember but it was still good.  My wife ordered the Stacked Enchiladas and requested Manchego cheese only since it is sheeps milk and she cannot have any cow dairy.  When the food was delivered, it had other cheese all over so they had to take it back and get her another one.  When the new plate came out, it was missing the egg on top.  Needless to say, the meal want sideways and we couldn't wait to get out of there fast enough.  Did they really expect me to start eating when my wife didn't have her food yet?  By the time it came, mine was cold.  I had the tacos and they were okay but I think I was already influenced by the lack of attention and the food not coming out the right way.  I hate to say it but we won't be going back.   Maybe we just caught them in a bad day."}
{"text":"Went here for Dining Out for Life a couple of days ago. I heard that the Pork Osso Bucco is awesome, but it's a large entree and ALOT of food, so I decided to order the Beef Tenderloin Filet instead. The chorizo, potato and menonita cheese stuffed poblano was tasty, the filet was overdone, so was a bit on the dry side.  Don't get me wrong, it was still edible, however, there was not nearly enough sauce to battle the dryness *sigh*.   Hubby and one of our friends ordered the Sergio's Pork Tenderloin, said both of their entrees were overdone and (again) not enough sauce.   The pomegranate margarita was good, but nothing extra special.   Our waitress was pleasant, but didn't know anything about the items on the menu, read through the list of specials like she was actually an auctioneer and forgot how to breath, couldn't make any recommendations, and well, seemed to be more of a hostess than a member of the wait staff.   Based on intel from diners at a couple of other tables, it seems like I was there on an off night, so maybe sometime in the future I'll give it another try. Nothing was bad, but I was far from 'Wow'd'."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I had driven by Sierra Bonita about a million times before finally being formally introduced to their delicious menu. I had no clue this little gem of a place was hidden here. In fact, I seriously thought it was going to be some kind of cheesy, chain restaurant. No no, my friends, it is not.   In fact, this is much more of an upscale restaurant than I would typically visit. Which is exactly why I always sit in the bar and order from the appetizer section of the menu. And oh my, there are so many delicious options just in that little section. However, my favorite by far has got to be their mac and cheese. It is definitely not your traditional, American mac and cheese...but the green chiles and unique pasta make it so very tasty. I find that it's plenty of food for a main course (and much more affordable too!). If you're looking for other less expensive options, the queso and guacamole are great too. The adult beverages are always good, but they do seem a bit overpriced.   Overall though, I think it's Sierra Bonita's atmosphere that keeps bringing me back. It offers a lot of variety: from dark and sexy, to comfy bar tops, to a cozy patio that exudes ambiance. It's definitely different from your typical Phoenix restaurant which is a big lure.   The only drawbacks to this place? The service is questionable and the price is rather steep. I've been here four or five times now and I've mostly been served by unfriendly, snooty characters. I'm not sure what the deal is with that. Maybe because I'm too busy trying to save money and prefer to order appetizers. Is there a secret monetary amount that's supposed to be spent when you dine here? Or maybe it's just a too-cool-for-school vibe. Either way, I do not enjoy a server who isn't polite. Take your attitude elsewhere buddy.   All in all, Sierra Bonita is a great, local restaurant. It's a nice place for happy hour or a date night out. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I decided a few months back to check this place out after another Yelper posted a check in picture of that weeks lunch specials on a day I was eating 200 feet away at a burger place. Now I have been 5 times. On the fourth trip the owner came over and introduced himself as he remembered seeing my there before. Next time I went in he greeted me like an old friend and asked if I wanted my usual table. Mind you, these trips were spread out at about once a month.   I've had several lunch specials and the SB signature burger. The food has always been good and I never have walked away hungry. Don't let the fact it is a bit pricey for every day lunch scare you away.  The service has always been excellent except for one item. Consistently when you are done and pushed your plate to the side it takes a while to get your check and then a while more to get it picked up. Part of that may be I get there right at the opening bell and it gets busier as lunch rolls on and the second waiter/waitress doesn't start right away.  This place is definitely in my lunch rotation when I am in that part of town."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the service is wonderful. I love this place. Cozy ambience."}
{"text":"Wow! OK. I already love this place and the people that work there but now, now there is BRUNCH. Yes, there was brunch before, but not this brunch. The new menu selections made my stomach roar as I tried to narrow down my choices. My dining companion had no problem though.  He zeroed in on the Verde Vaqueros with scrambled eggs. As if biscuits and gravy aren't a good enough concept on their own. These things are huge. Beer batted biscuits with green chilies and a marvelous loft. Smothered in a decadent sausage gravy. I had to have a bite. Then OK., another bite. I could never eat this big of a plate in the morning but if you like lots of great food to get you going on the weekend this is the ticket.   I had the vegetable omelet and it was fabulous. A beautiful mixture of grilled seasonal vegetables and just enough wonderful cheese to hold it all together. Not heavy, not greasy, nice and light but bursting with fresh summer flavor and plenty of food. It was served with a great roasted root vegetable side that was much tastier than your run of the mill has browns.  The service was attentive and friendly as always. I also suggest the sangria if you are looking for a little hair-of-the-dog. It goes good with the south western flavors of the cuisine.   I can't wait until my next Sunday morning visit so I can work my way through the entire brunch menu. I am wanting to try out the chocolate almond muffin. Will definitely have to ride my bike there to make up for it.  This is a neighborhood gem that is worth the drive from any where. I just happen to have it in my neighborhood! Thanks Sierra."}
{"text":"I had the Southwest Cobb Salad again. It was just delicious. My only suggestion is to have them mix the ingredients. I am sure the presentation would not be as nice but I think it would be easier to eat.   I had it mixed today. I prefer it unmixed. I am sure it is psychological but it tastes better without mixing it together."}
{"text":"I went with a party of seven last night. It was awesome. The service was perfect and never obtrusive. The food was fantastic (my salmon is pictured). There was a lot of great diversity in the food and drink options. The atmosphere was great. Kind of dark and quiet. If I'm ever close by again I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have to give Sierra Bonita a series of third and fourth chances because really and truly, I want to love it.  People that I love and respect love it.  I love the people working there.  I love the potent margaritas.  I adore the decor.  And the menu is sexy and inviting.  But...  I blatantly, completely order wrong when I come here.  To the point that I decided that I might actually hate it.  Like get up and leave mid-bite.  My $16 Cowboy Stew was flavorless and sad - like church potluck beef stew with hominy and soggy fried parsnips as an afterthought.  A sea bass special was described with such a litany of delicious adjectives (saffron, chorizo, porcini mushrooms and poblanos) that one would think that the food would literally sing.  No dice - it tasted like absolutely nothing.  As in not a single taste sensation whatsover - I think I have food in my mouth but I'm not sure...What the heck, Sierra Bonita?  This was approved as a special?  At subsequent visits, I've had the carne asada (toothsome) and the red chile pork (flavorful and tender) and have felt a little better about the place.  Like 3 stars as opposed to 2.  But I don't want you to be just a bunch of hype - I want every single dish on your menu to be a winner so that I can visit your establishment fortnightly (with friends in tow), order fearlessly, and love you forever.  Can you make that happen?"}
{"text":"I completely loooooved the carne asada tacos. Tender, marinated, Strips of steak, I squeeze lime juice on them and add sour cream. They're addicting! Cool atmosphere, and a fun grown up playground. It's not really set up for small children, but ours are grown! The food bursts with flavor and is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"So we went here for lunch and was happpy,. I did not even expect to eat here but we saw it on the way to another place and decided to try it out. The inside is a cozy new Mexico western kinda feel to it. We had the pork dish we had is unreal. Smoked pork, rice and beans, and a couple tortillas. This dish made this a 4 star review rather than a 3 star. The girlfriend and I decided to split that and a sandwich. We tried the turkey sandwich and it was just OK, came with fries. On the turkey sandwich it came with pablano peppers which sounded good but it was one really big pepper and it was to thick for the sandwich. Mabey if they cut it into smaller pieces we would have liked it better. The waitstaff and host were very friendly and the prices are good. Lunch specials for as cheap as $10 and somethings ranging in the $20 area. I want to come here for happy hour, and that pork dish. This place is worth a try for sure!"}
{"text":"The service here was EXCELLENT...hostesses were really friendly, and Jessica S #118 knew all the beers on draft (surprisingly, many servers don't), and was friendly and efficient.  We had the cup of posole ($7; it's a big cup!), which was good.  We liked the broth, but thought the meat was kinda flavorless.  We also shared the Queso Fundido appetizer ($10), my first time trying this dish anywhere, and it was delicious!  The ambiance wasn't there for my husband, but it was quiet and a bit dark and pleasant IMO.  We would return here if there weren't so many other places to try during our visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Helping a friend move the last remnants out of his swanky bachelor pad... and he turned me onto this gem. Apparently owned by the same people who do PHX City Grille, about which I've heard very mixed and non-exciting feedback.  BUT... I loved this place. Had instant charm. The rustic but clean and modernish decor, the friendly staff and attentive service had me before the food.  And a patio. Goddamit I want a patio like this in my neighborhood.  Knowing how much I love to cook and knowing what a foodie I am, Greggy seemed a little concerned that I would be underwhelmed.Then the dishes came out and that concern was put to rest.   Was my first trip, so I had to try the Posole as a benchmark - lean chunks of tasty pork, perfectly firm hominy. Nice thinnish broth. The cabbage and lime was a perfect topper. My culinary companion got a dish with a chicken stuffed blue corn tortilla, a buncha yummy stuff on top and topped with a fried egg (check my pics)!   Very good. Not knock your socks off gourmet or \"muy autentico homemade at gramma's house\". But quality, flavorful stuff. Lots of choices. Lots of specials. Excited to work my way through the menu.  If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"We decided to hit Sierra Bonita for dinner. Luckily, there was no wait and it wasn't too busy so that was good. Our server was nice and friendly so nothing to complain about there.   We ordered the queso fundido starter and me and the future hubby shared the SBG burger - Fresh ground chuck, chorizo, cheddar cheese, roasted green chiles, fried egg. Sounds good, doesn't it?  What was nice is that they split the burger for us and the burger came with fries. The food was just okay. I wasn't blown away, but it did its purpose which was to get me full."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  I thought the prices were a LIL bit high for the grub.  But overall...GREAT atmosphere.  Tasty food.  Good portions.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Brunch, Lunch, Dinner or Happy Hour - Sierra Bonita Grill does EVERYTHING well!  Among my favorite items:  Fresh Squeezed Margarita - served in a martini glass, this is really something special.  No icky sweet pre-made mix here - just a wonderful blend of Reposado tequila, orange liqueur, fresh lime juice and agave nectar.    Bacon wrapped shrimp - among the very best I have tasted, the four large shrimp make a gorgeous presentation atop the plate drizzled with barbecue sauce along with a side of a slightly spicy remoulade.  Amazing.   Southwestern Benedict - there is no better reason to have brunch.  Two green chile beer biscuits are topped with savory ham, panko crusted poached eggs (sounds weird, they are delicious!) and roasted poblano hollandaise.    I can't stay away from Sierra Bonita - the friendly staff and fantastic food never disappoints.  Ever!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience overall. Good wine selection, and their carne asada was excellent."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food was just okay. Cast iron pan that was used to serve appetizer was rusty. I own my own cast iron and it never looks like that. I'd never cook in my cast iron if it looked like that. Just sayin. I think they need to learn how to better care for cast iron if they are gonna use it. Cast iron needs to be dried thoroughly after each use to avoid rust. Light coat of oil should be applied before storing."}
{"text":"I like Sierra Bonita because it's something different. They present a new take on what is typically cheese drenched, heavy Mexican food in Phoenix's north central corridor for a healthier, more upscale version.   Good for a date or, even better, the perfect place to bring Mom to let her know you took some of her nutritional babble to heart and are eating at places like this in your young adulthood.   There are good specialty drinks like mojitos and cadillac margaritas and the beer selection is nothing to shake a stick at, either."}
{"text":"Pretty good place.  Good beer and wine selection plus great cocktails.  My grilled pork chop was delicious, and the bread pudding was amazing.  We will come again"}
{"text":"amazing dishes, good prices, great service. Oh, and they have some insanely good microbrews on tap.   I had the roast chicken, which was really really good. My friend had the pork osso buccco, which I tasted and was blown away.  The guac appetizer was excellently done. Geoffrey was our server and gave us excellent service. We'll definitely be back soon.. Loved it!"}
{"text":"First time going to the restaurant, the food was ok. Not authentic Mexican restaurant, more like south eastern wannabe Mexican food. Waiter only came around once and we had to ask for her and tell her we needed the check. She also took forever to take the payment and when she came back she gave me $2 change in quarters... what kind of shit is that?! I asked if I can have them changed to dollars and she stated they have no dollar bills. What the??? I should of told her to give me one of her dollar bill tips she probably had in exchange for the change..... oh wait she probably didn't have any because of the bad customer service she provides. By the way her name is (Michelle) beeeeeeeeeeeeeee."}
{"text":"I love the building, music choices (\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" soundtrack!), and we got amazing service but the prices vs. size of plates leaves something to be desired. This place is definitely a little too upscale for my wallet.  That being said, the breakfast banana walnut muffin was definitely worth the $3. It came with a thing of really great butter and the muffin itself was warm, moist, fresh with actual chunks of banana and chocolate and  was SO good. But then the carne taco plate disappointed. Two \"street\" style tacos (but with flour tortillas) with sub-par beans and rice (that were a little too gringo-style for my tastes) for $13?? I think not. A sample of my friend's french toast egg sandwich was good as well as the guacamole (but also ridiculously up-priced). The panko-covered eggs Benedict ($14-15) was really different and also looked good. The muffin was definitely the highlight for my meal.  I would come back for the breakfast menu or maybe Happy Hour but other than that, there are better choices in the area for someone like me."}
{"text":"My first time here from a groupon and really enjoyed an elegant mexican meal with a southwester twist....service was just okay, but at least willing."}
{"text":"I love osso bucco, they have really good mexi-style osso bucco, so I love them.  I prefer to sit on the patio or in the bar.  But keep in mind, parking sucks if you go on a busy night."}
{"text":"Loved it here. I came for happy hour with a few friends, and we ordered many drinks and food items from the menu. While the food was amazing and tasted great, in fact a few of the happy hour dishes we ordered twice, the drinks were not up to standard for me. The Moscow mule that they call 'Miguel's mule\" was very weak and barely had any ginger beer in it. I then ordered ciroc and club soda, and that was a bit better. For apps our table ordered the poppers which were delicious ( so we ordered a second time) the green chili that was out of this world ( so we ordered it again) and some quack and chips.   Finally, one last note about happy hour, I wish they extend it to at least 7, as most of us got there at 5:15 after work and we only got to enjoy it for 45 minutes (until 6:00 0"}
{"text":"Sierra Bonita is great.  The staff couldn't be more wonderful; the friendly, neighborhood atmosphere makes every experience a good one; the cocktails (and sangria) are top notch and so is the food.  I recommend the stuffed jalapeno appetizers and the Santa Cruz pasta."}
{"text":"I only go there for happy hour--$2 beer and half off small plates and apps make it one of the better (and cheaper) HHs in the North-Central corridor."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour menu/drinks, great food, cool patio setting next to the bar and the private rooms downstairs are great for business meetings.  This would be a 5*, but the parking isn't very easy to deal with.  Highly recommended though!"}
{"text":"First of all I cant believe I haven't review Sierra Bonita yet. Our family loves this place! The buttermilk chicken is always a crowd pleaser so is their signature salad, so yum!   The past Sunday I hosted a baby shower in their private rooms. PEOPLE LISTEN UP if you need an event space they do not charge a room fee or make you meet a minimum!!! AMAZING!   Nate the owner, Maria the event coordinator and Michelle our waitress were all just fabulous! When I had a minor freak out that the linens were going to be tan and not white Maria pulled some strings and at no extra cost to me had white linens for my event!   The food was fabulous, all the guests enjoyed their meals. We went during the brunch. And for 16 people with nonalcoholic drinks, tax AND tip my bill was only $280!! That's a damn deal folks!!!   I encourage you to not only go here for dinner but host any party you might want some privacy and exceptional service! P.S. the private rooms are underground and your guests get to ride down via elevator, so it kinda makes it really cool!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with some friends Sunday night.  Atmosphere is awesome and service was very good, not overbearing, but attentive. Food was fantastic, everyone loved their choices. This is one of our go to places for a super meal!"}
{"text":"Went back for Happy Hour last week.. It was so much better than I remember, and the service was fantastic! The half priced appetizers at happy hour really hit the spot, and the guacamole was first rate... we will put this back on our rotation for sure."}
{"text":"The food here was very tasty and authentic. The guacamole and three salsas were delicious.  The main dish was spicier than I thought it would e but I could not stop eating it because it was so good! It was the Smoke red pork roast. The service was friendly and fast. I would definitely come back here again.  The setting is casual, semiprivate, a good date night spot."}
{"text":"Even though it has been a couple of months since I first visited Sierra Bonita- my meal is still fresh on my mind, I cannot wait to go back!  I started my meal with the green corn tamale-amazing! Seriously, I could of eaten 5 of these. The sauce made the whole experience. I followed it up with the Atole Pinon Hotcakes and was not disappointed.  The hotcake was lighter than I thought it would be but full of flavor. The husband the swordfish which was a catch of the day special.   Our service was prompt and the atmosphere allowed us to occupy a table for an extended period of time and catch up with friends in between bites."}
{"text":"What an awesome surprise is Sierra Bonita. The pomegranate margarita is beyond scrumptious. We had guacamole (superb); carne asada street tacos and green chile pork (served in a skillet with a tortilla big enough to shelter a small family) over received beans and Serrano peppers. Yum, yum, yum."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I kind of went in here with the expectation that it would be more of a slightly upscale Mexican dining experience. Only after looking at the menu did I realize that it's more of the Southwestern variety. Is there a difference? Sort of, I guess. They seem to be more liberal with their creativity and bending traditional rules that would probably make your abuelita shake her finger in anger. Not that I would necessarily consider that a bad thing.  It's very easy to miss this place if you're not careful. If I didn't know beforehand that it was located near a Wells Fargo, I would have easily passed it. I actually really like the interior.  The restaurant is very heavy on the wood, including the ceilings. There's a scent that kind of reminds me of being in a Southwestern-influenced hotel - which might be a good or bad thing depending on how nostrils are wired to your brain. I like it!  We started with the guacamole and had very high expectations. I mean, who wouldn't for nine dollars? The salsas were not too bad, but the guacamole was essentially just your standard guacamole that was no better than any other run of the mill restaurant. It's one of those things that we wanted to like, but just found it to be a letdown. You want great guacamole? Go to Asi Es La Vida and then you'll understand.  I went with the carne asada tacos, which came with some very good rice and spicy beans. The asada had good flavor, although I much prefer being able to mix up my taco options so I can try a variety. The pesto mayonnaise might have been a little too extreme for my usual tastes, but it was by no means bad. My girlfriend, on the other hand, ordered the stacked enchiladas which she was pretty neutral about. She also found kind of unusual that they looked a little different than other examples posted on Yelp. Southwestern restaurants kind of make up their own rules, so who knows what that was about.  For dessert, we debated between the buttermilk cake and the croissant pudding, ultimately deciding on the latter. We instantly regretted it. Maybe it's just personal preference, but I don't really see a standard bakery-like croissant as a legitimate dessert - regardless of what you drizzle on top. That's like calling someone a wizard just because they grew a beard. I'm very familiar with bread pudding, but this was essentially just bread. And I can assure you, the last thing we want for dessert is just plain ole' bread. The sauce did very little to hide this fact. It has since achieved notoriety of being one of the few desserts that we did NOT finish out of sheer boredom.    I don't want to be too harsh, because nothing was really offensively bad. We just didn't feel that it was worthy of all of the praise it currently receives. Perhaps if we return, I'll experiment with some of their campanelle pasta or breakfast options.    I recommend going at least once to see if it fits your tastes, but we found our experience to be pretty average."}
{"text":"My friends have been raving about this place for years so we decided to check them out during happy hour. The interior is beautiful. I normally detest southwest decorating but they pulled it off. The atmosphere was classy yet casual. I had a couple cocktails. The margarita was excellent. Strong and not too sweet. Definitely not a mix. We split the chips, guacamole and salsa. The variety of salsas were great. My husband had the green chili pork and I had the green chili mac and cheese. Both were excellent and large portions for being on the happy hour menu. Service was excellent too. Although it is out of our neighborhood, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with this place.   The service was just alright and in general, i felt like it was overpriced for the food that i got.   I know they're trying to do some sort of \"mexican fusion\", but it wasn't really mexican or fusion.   I felt like for the price of the entrees, they should at least give you bread or chips as an appetizer.  The filet was more like prime rib and the flavors were pretty dull.  The one good point of the restaurant was the drinks. They had awesome mixed drinks and the bar atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"A highly recommended restaurant from separate concierges at the Hilton Pointe Squaw Peak Resort. To their reco's, the Sierra Bonita did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the bacon covered shrimp and I loved the buttermilk chicken with asparagus.  I was pleasantly surprised when our waitress brought a complimentary 's'mores' dessert for my colleague who was celebrating his birthday that night.  Our waitress was ultra-sweet and fun; despite telling us we were welcome to stay as late as she wanted, we could tell when the chairs were on the tables and the lights were being turned off that our time there was coming to an end."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Sierra Bonita fairly regularly since it's opening day. We like sitting at the bar and chatting with friends and the great bartenders and staff. I can honestly say that I have had nearly everything on the menu. Last night I finally tried the Pork Osso Buco and can now say without question, it was one of the best things I have ever had, anywhere. A huge and delicious pork shank on a bed of cheddar mashed spuds, veggies, and these incredible caramelized cipolini onions, covered in a hatch chile sauce that is making my mouth water right now. And I am full!  Every time we come in, if Nate one of the owners is around, he makes a point to come up and chat a bit with us. This place has a unique yet traditional southwestern style and identity that Nate has carefully maintained over the years. It's our \"local\" and will continue to be so.   Last night the food and atmosphere was so exceptional, I had to \"Yelp it.\" Thanks!"}
{"text":"The foods good..the place is nice and the servers friendly. Would recommend the buttermilk chicken and the mashed sweet potato is a welcome side.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Love the jalapeño poppers and the nachos were great. Love meeting the family here for drinks to catch up"}
{"text":"First time although I live just down the street. Great chips and salsa is always a plus. The food was excellent. It really made for a nice Valentines date. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wowza, what a place to dine.  Lovely atmosphere, great service, friendly staff.  Now the food: YUMMY! I wish I could have stayed and tasted each item.  From the hamburger to the benedict plate I got.  We were in foodie heaven.  This is a must for lunch or dinner.  Great cocktails.  Price was very reasonable for the portions and yummy food.  Highly recommend. Thank you Sierra Bonita Grill for a wonderful Phoenix culinary experience."}
{"text":"My family had lunch here while vacationing in Phoenix.  Although a bit pricey, the food was very good.  I had the carne asada, which was a nice quality cut of steak with a pink center, and my wife had the red enchiladas suizas which she really enjoyed.  Both meals had their charro beans on the side, which were the most delicious beans I have ever tasted.  Amazing!  My son had the wood grilled burger, which was very tender and juicy on a nice soft (but not too soft) roll, while my daughter enjoyed the carne asada tacos.  Both kids ate well, which is high praise from them.  The only reason I'm not giving Sierra Bonita Grill five stars is the somewhat high prices.  But after such a nice meal, I paid the check without complaint!"}
{"text":"Does anyone else think this place has gone downhill?  From the ever decreasing portion of guacamole, to the tired salads?  I used to love this neighborhood spot. Buttermilk chicken is my favorite- but tonight, not only was the portion tiny (lots of mashed potatoes to compensate for the sparse protein), but I'm pretty sure my chicken was a reheat!  Bland, dry and sparse. My husband was also disappointed in the portion size of the stuffed chicken, which he described as\"ok\". Let's hope this restaurant gets back on track. It seems as if other people have noticed- one used to have to wait for a seat, which is no longer the case."}
{"text":"Don't skip this place.  It may be a bit hard to find but it's worth every U-turn.  Go for happy hour and chat with the bartenders as you enjoy these amazing tacos and some of the best salsas around.  They aren't stingy with the guacamole chips either yay!  I didn't have it this time, but their chicken sandwich is AMAZING- so if you're hungry - you won't be sorry!  Great happy hour specials.  Just go already!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Sierra Bonita! Here is my list of reasons to love this place:   1. Happy Hour- 1/2 off apps and awesome drink specials   2.  Mini Quesadillas. I am addicted to these things!! I had never had huitlacoche (a fungus that grows on ears of corn) until now. Try them, you will not be disappointed! The bacon wrapped shrimp are awesome as well. Honestly, there is nothing that I have had here that I did not like.   3. Great drinks! The sangria is very tasty and Kenny's margaritas are the among the best I've ever had.   4. Fabulous patio complete with cozy fireplace. I wish I could open my slider door and walk out to this everyday. The inside is dimly lit and intimate; great for a date night or an evening with friends.   5. The hottest server in the Valley works there- Kelton!  If you show up and Kelton is not working, leave immediately!!  I say this with a disclaimer- the absolute hottest server, my Nico, did work there, but sadly for many Valley women, quit some time ago.  So Kelton, the title now belongs to you my friend.  6.  The service is supreme!  When we aren't honored with Kelton's presence, we are treated to great service by Julie, Kenny, Nate and all the other great  peeps at SB.  We frequent Sierra Bonita almost weekly and for good reasons.  If you have wanted to try it and haven't, I encourage you to go this weekend!  This place will soon be your home away from home...it's certainly ours!"}
{"text":"We were blown away with both the food and the service.  We ordered the Buttermilk Chicken and the Pork Tenderloin; both were outta this world!  The Green Corn Tamale was incredible.  Amazing customer service!!!  Can't wait to try their weekend brunch.  We will definitely come back her often."}
{"text":"Since I just hit 100 check ins at this restaurant, I felt I should update my review.  This is probably one of my favorite places in town to eat.  I have never had a bad experience.  Always excellent service and excellent food. Buttermilk Chicken with sweet potatoes is out of this world. Also the Jack Daniel's Bread Pudding is to die for."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not remarkable in any particular way.  Last minute decision to pop up to the bar for dinner last night.   Love that they have Dos Equis Amber on draft (most places only have lager).  Chips & guac were a little diappointing....  tasted like the bottom of a bag of store-bought chips... but the guac itself not too shabby.   Salsas were unique and I did enjoy their flavor.  Had the carne asada plate which comes with rice, beans, and a really delicious authentic thin tortilla.  The beef had good seasoning and flavor, but a little dry and chewy.  Fish tacos were fine, but again nothing remarkable.  Dark atmosphere, nice bartenders.  Good pinots by the glass."}
{"text":"Visited on a Tuesday night at the end of June - place was pretty packed for a Tuesday.  I had the North Central Chicken, which is apparently a new menu item and wonderful.  Almost like a spicy BBQ sauce on the chicken and some sort of corn/green chile sauce that was fantasic.  The corn was cut off the cob and you could tell it was super fresh.  Came with mashed red potatoes.  The smaller portion option was a perfect amount of food.  Paired with a glass of white wine, a perfect hot summer meal that I didn't have to cook!  Oh - and you have to get the guacamole.  I don't think you can eat a meal there without having the guacamole first."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and have wonderful food.  There are a few things that stand out on this menu...one of them being the wonderful Pinot Nior's that they offer...and the 2nd, is the guacamole.  I know, I know...not the best pairing in the world, but when a girl needs a glass of vino, there are worse things in the world to pair with! ;) Great Carne Asada (my man's favorite) and I LOVE the Green Chile Posole.  Good amount of spice and isn't too hot, if you're not a spicy girl like me!  It's super cute inside and we love going during the week, there's rarely a wait!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family tonight & it was some of the best Mexican food we've ever had. We started off wth The queso with chorizo & it was amazing! Everything we had was amazing, even the margaritas & the portions are huge.  Great place, staff & ambiance as well! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The atmosphere is great- like old Phoenix but with style. The food is really different and flavorfull. They have amazing margaritas. Every time I have been there, the service has been great. I wish they had a kids menu but other than that, I love it!"}
{"text":"This is a place we will return to frequently!  Met some friends here on a Friday afternoon and were easily seated for dinner on the patio.  Thought it might be too hot at 5:30Pm, but the patio is chilled....probably with evap.  It was perfectly comfortable.  We both started with margaritas...of course!  Jeannie slurped down her pomegranate margarita and my house version was well received.  Guacamole was our natural choice and we it was a good start to an enjoyable meal.  The fish tacos were some of the best we have ever had ( Jeannie shared hers with me:) and I went with the $12 smoked red chile pork roast. If I could have picked up my plate and licked all of the pork and chile residue off it, I would have!  The menu promises lots of tasty return visits. Course, more margaritas will have to be part of the experience.  As an important side note, the service here was fantastic! Everyone was super attentive.  This place seems to be working on all cylinders"}
{"text":"Really just okay.  From the reviews I expected something great.  The bacon wrapped shrimp was over cooked and very chewy, the peppers were good (not a lot of flavor, but good).  The carne asada was not that great, meat was tough and they gave us only 1 stale tortilla. The service was awful! Matt was anything but welcoming, I felt like I was imposing on him to even be there."}
{"text":"Started off strong with the appetizers (green chili mac & stuffed jalapeños) and failed to deliver on the entrees.  How can you call that albóndigas soup? It was a twisted version of something reminiscent of Indianan cuisine. The green chili pork has officially turned me off to Southwestern food and the short ribs were flat out disappointing. Location completely out of the city center. Not worth your time or money. This place was all hype. Don't believe the reviews!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp dinner special last night.  What an amazing creation!  Jumbo shrimp, (and these were huge!!) cooked perfectly with wonderful polenta & vegetables.  Service at Sierra Bonita is always great!  Treat yourself to a fantastic experience!!"}
{"text":"Im obsessed with this place!  I found it randomly when I was driving around and realized jt was almost 3pm and I hadn't eaten all day.... I ordered the gluten free fish tacos and it was so good. The staff is great and the place is really nice.  I took my friend there yesterday and ordered the gluten free southwestern Cobb salad and she had the Carne Asada tacos. We are picky, super picky. Making both of us happy at the same time when it comes to food is not easy. But my big beautiful salad was perfect. And she enjoyed her food too. I have been craving this salad all day, so right now my hubby is on his way down to pick it up for me. Awesome husband, thanks baby ;) I'm excited for him to try the food, because this is my new go-to restaurant. I highly recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"Someone at work mentions there is a place that has a signature burger made of ground chuck and chorizo and the next thing you know, you're there for dinner by the weekend. I went with some friends and I have to say, everything just sort of clicked. The service was good but not overly obtrusive (no one coming around every 5 minutes to ask how the meal is going, which I appreciate). We started with the ceviche, which was a mix of shrimp and fish, with avocado and lime juice, and the guacamole, which was a little bit too smooth for my taste (yes, I like it a little chunky) but quite good. The chips are a bit thicker than most but that also means they don't fall apart. I think they would benefit with some of the chip spicing they do at Mucho Gusto in Tempe but nothing to complain about.  For dinner, I really wanted to try some of the main items but I'd come for the signature burger (ground chuck and chorizo) with roasted green peppers and a fried egg. I will say that the meat was delicious but so juicy that it was almost impossible to hold the b urger together. I finally just took off the top and ate it like an open faced sandwich. So, while good, the bottom bun should not be soaked with au jus if it really is a burger. I thought it was interesting but probably would not get it again, but it was an experience. Now, an unexpected treat, I got sauteed veggies as a side and these were fresh and to be honest, delicious. It is always nice when you expect the side dish to be blah but you see that the establishment pays attention to detail at that level. The one thing I noticed, relative to service, is that there could be a bit more focus in clearing off used dishes and glasses when food or new drinks is dropped off. I had to sort of start handing items to the waitress but then she got the idea and got all the used items away from the eating experience.  As my friends are all about the full dining experience, we got desert and coffee. We all shared a slice of buttermilk pie with a caramel drizzle and it was..OMG....amazing! As with side veggies I often think deserts at many places don't get the full attention of the kitchen but this slide of pie was the best buttermilk pie I've ever eaten and I've had my fair share. We also had coffee and it was good premium coffee and the waitress even asked if we wanted a refill so even though I could see the place was popular it was nice to see they did not try to rush us out but let our meal have its own pacing.  Bottom line, I want to come back again and after two or three times, if I still have the same quality experience, I think this will be five stars and after the summer is over would love to come check out the patio seating. Bottom line, worth a visit, chances are greatly in favor of you not only NOT being disappointed but being delighted with your dining experience."}
{"text":"I am most definitely a fan.  My friend was taking me out to dinner the other night and it was my choice.  I have been to Sierra Bonita a long time ago and I remember that I loved my experience there before.  This time it was just as memorable.  For starters we had the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Oh boy was that pleasure in my mouth! I had the buttermilk chicken with the side of mashed chipotle sweet potatoes.  It was amazing....and I made sure I left room for dessert!  I told myself I would only have a bite of the bread pudding and save the rest for later.    Yeah....that didn't happen.  I devoured that amazing dessert with spectacular speed.    I can't wait to go back to try something new!!!"}
{"text":"Went back last night and had the pork tenderloin. WOW. Chocolate espresso rubbed pork with a vanilla reduction. Try this dish, it is awesome!"}
{"text":"After 5 days of Phoenix and some pretty good food, this was the best. I had the pasta with poblano cream sauce, chicken, pine nuts and tomatoes. It was great. Other folks in my party had the enchiladas, the buttermilk chicken, and some soup. Everyone reported good things and our plates were taken away empty. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast! I love how they blend the Mexican Influence with the Classic Breakfast. Anything with the green chile is recommended and the Monte Cristo was solid. I will be back for more amazing eats!"}
{"text":"This is a Solid great place to rest a while eat some great food. Best in Tacos (Carne steak) yum yum. Bread pudding Desert is way up there. Great Guacamole. Great pork green Chile roast with soft flour tortillas."}
{"text":"I continue to love this place after all these years and continue to come here because of the Azteca Soup.  We finally tried brunch here and it was absolutely delicious!  The dishes were creative and sounded so interesting we had a hard time choosing.  Everything was flavorful and had a good spice.  I had breakfast enchiladas - egg, carne asada, chorizo, red chile sauce and hubby had a dish of root vegetables, sausage and green chile sauce.   Needless to say, we cleaned our plates.  The service was great too.  Also, one of things I love here, they let you substitute your side for anything - including a cup of Azteca soup!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to brunch spot! Tom the bartender (whos super cute) hooks it up! Let him have his way with you(r drinks) and he won't steer you wrong. First beverage he brought me was a blackberry champagne mojito super light and refreshing. The second was also a champagne cocktail of sorts, I believe it had some sort of peach puree in it. It was absolutely delightful!  The coolest thing about it was it had a sphere of ice in it that looked like a crystal ball. Magical!  As for the food it also didn't disappoint. Tom suggested we start with cheese stuffed jalapenos not fried. Oohy gooey and oh so tasty. My entree was the huevous rancheros pretty straight forward but lighter and crispier than I've had before served with roasted root veggies. Surely palate pleasing!"}
{"text":"I am new to the Phoenix area and when my parents flew in for a visit, I was desperately looking on Yelp for someplace close by to take them to for dinner. Boy were the reviews on this place right! We had a LOVELY dinner, were treated wonderfully by the staff, and 2 of us ordered that evening's special, were so impressed with the dish, the chef himself came out and talked to us, and gave us the recipe! (which we then tried to recreate that weekend at home) The lighting was a little dark, but didn't take away from the experience at all. Decorated with Western art, excellent staff, reasonable prices, great specials, and a good variety on the menu."}
{"text":"We came at lunchtime and they were making only lunch specials and I was a little skeptical.   We ordered all of them and they were absolutely delicious!  Staff had a bit of an attitude.   They could of been more accepting that regular menu items not BEING available is at first confusing.   But, \"tude\" aside, so good!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here last Friday evening. She, Elizabeth S., already has contributed a two star review to this site. She was answered by a cold-shouldered \"you should have told the manager\" response. Thank you! I had no idea that your failings were our fault. I will keep this in mind. However, I might add that this was a special occasion that none of us wished to tarnish with a complaint about the food. Further, because it was so hard to get our waiter's attention, he was obviously pained when asked about the specials, causing him to seek out the \"cheat sheet,\" and he never returned to inquire about our meals, it was ridiculous to assume that a manager would prove more responsive. As to the meal, the pork shank was a poor piece of meat from which a revoltingly globulus protuberance of fat had not been trimmed. The pork and the substance underneath were so lathered and saturated with an alleged green chili sauce that they resembled nothing so much as a bony, beige hillock in a culinary wasteland. The sauce itself resembled a congealant. As to the presentation, to say it was \"inartful\" would mistakenly suggest that the responsible party had some sense of art. Rather, it was dumped upon the plate in an uniquely unappetizing manner. As to the pork tenderloin, the meat was excellent and well cooked, impeded only by a tasteless coating of chocolate or coffee or some unidentifiable brown substance. The meat and \"sauce\" were unseasoned, and the mysteriously glistening \"sauce\" might have been outdone by a prison cook working with corn starch, hot water and a bouillon cube. The most startling aspect of this \"presentation\" was the mass of vegetable matter consisting of three or four dessicated cubes of potato and random, undressed greens that might have  been harvested from a five day old \"bag o'greens\" available at a $.99 discount food store. The chicken was soggy and forcefully continued the beige motif begun by the pork shank. We have no objection to paying a steep price for excellent food. However, we do object to the not inconsiderable cost of this barely middling dinner. You may now assume that we have informed the manager.."}
{"text":"On the weekends this place gets packed so make a reservation.  My wife and me ordered a app, soup and an entree.  Got the guac that was tasty but small portion.  Then we were served the entree. When asked about the posole soup we had ordered they said they'd have it right out.  Was almost done with the entree by the time it came. The waiter said he would be right back with the cabbage and lime that was supposed to be with the soup. Well it never came until we asked 2 other times. Horrible service-props for tasty food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very pleasant and different. The food is fabulous and different. The chicken dish is out of this world. You have to have some Hoppers Poppers that are delicious  not firey. The bacon wrapped shrimp is wonderful!! A while back I had the Osso bucco that was to die for. I anticipate going back many times so we can try out the rest of the meals."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for brunch and it's great! My carnivorous son got the steak and eggs and it looked pretty high quality. My girl likes the Chilaquiles and I've enjoyed the vegetarian omelet and I totally vouch for the Huevos Rancheros.  I'm excited to head there for lunch or dinner to try the margaritas and something that's not on the brunch menu."}
{"text":"Roasted red chile pork something  Great musical variety, including Willie Nelson and local boy Glen Campbell"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Flavors were amazing!!! Chips are warm and wonderful!!! This cheat meal didn't disappoint! We ordered the salmon and a burger. So yummy"}
{"text":"Before last weekend, it had been years since my last visit to Sierra Bonita. I remembered they had really good fried chicken, and I was glad to see it was just as delicious as I remembered! It was not at all greasy and was perfectly seasoned. The side of chipotle sweet mashed potatoes are so good! It's the perfect combination of sweet and spicy, and the gravy on the plate is just the right consistency and flavor. I also had a glass of wine and felt like they gave a very generous pour.  My boyfriend ordered the SBG burger. The combination of chorizo and ground chuck sounded great, but it was a little dry and I felt like something was missing.  The rest of the menu sounded great, and there are plenty more things I want to go back and try. Plus, they have 1/2 off bottles of wine on Tuesday nights. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to have modern Mexican cuisine! We ordered queso fundido, sopa de albóndigas, carne asada! Todo estuvo delicioso!!!!!"}
{"text":"When looking for a good southwestern restaurant we came across Sierra Bonita.  First time visitors, and very happy.  Good service; good food.   Especially liked the chovolate-rubbed porkloin.  We'll come back again soon."}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch or happy hour.  The place is always packed and has a nice atmosphere where you feel like you can kind of tuck away into a booth for private conversation...OR you can sit up closer by the bar where more of the action is.  I had the delicious jalapeno appetizer and the even better mac&cheese meal.  The owner is a great guy too."}
{"text":"My wife and I usually have a nice time here, but last night was a mess.  So much so I wanted to contact the owner but couldn't even find a way to contact anyone on their Web Site. We would probably go back because of the food, but definitely not the service.  It started off with a long wait when there were empty tables, I get it no reservation.  Then we are seated for over 10 minutes to get water, another 10 to get our drinks.  We order, the server was knowledgable, however after a long wait our food arrived, they had forgotten our appetizer.  We were given a free desert, so I will call that even.  When we got the bill it was correct, however, when we got the credit card receipt it was for someone else's table ( 3 times our bill).  That was quickly corrected and when I went to the greeter for some reassurance that the $173 card was not going to appear on our CC statement, she attempted to direct us to the bartender, which at that point I just wanted to leave and not deal with another person.  Anyone of these \"incidents\" alone is not a big deal but in concert along with a server that kept referring to me as \"brother\" and a greeter that calls my wife and I \"guys\" (I am not stuffy, however, unearned familiarity along with poor service is a bad combination) made for an overall poor experience on a rare night out without the kids."}
{"text":"Really enjoy Sierra Bonita Grill! They have supported the M.S. Society of Phoenix and their event Cooks & Chords for several years. I've enjoyed tasting their macaroni and cheese with green chilies, their amazing posole, enchiladas, santa cruz pasta and beans are amazing. Bartenders are attentive, knowledgeable and consistent. Check it out if you're in the area, small parking lot out front but enough parking out back. Cool ambiance inside, great date night spot!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the fish tacos and hamburger.  We enjoyed, but we had to take part of the burger home.  I ate before coming back to Atlanta.  The guacamole dip really was delicious."}
{"text":"We love this place!! Been several times for Sunday brunch and enjoyed our food each time. I have never been for dinner but I would like to try it!!"}
{"text":"great place, great staff and owner is wonderful the food is the best charro beans the pork and everything."}
{"text":"Wonderful! My friends in Phoenix had not tried this spot but it was close and the menu looked good.  The wine list is impressive: Peter Franus, Caduceus (AZ winery owned by Tool lead singer Maynard Keenan), Orin Swift and DeLille! I had a glass of Peter Franus cab, recently well rated by Wine Spectator. I think the waiter thought i Was a bit weird when I went on about how great the list was. :)  For dinner, I had the North Central Chicken, grilled red chile glazed chicken  with roasted poblano creamed corn, mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. The meal was delicious. I wouldn't have expected that mashed potatoes would pair well with the chile glaze but the chili flavor was mild.   My only regret was that I had to leave Phoenix with only one meal at Sierra Bonita - I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a great spot. I've been coming here for years and have always had 5 star visits. The interior is classy cowboy. Great bar with fun margarita options. Some things I have had that I would love to recommend are the guacamole and salsa trio, carne asada dinner, cheeseburger, and most importantly BREAD PUDDING.  Sometimes I come here just for this. Literally the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Nice hidden restaurant that has lot of fish dishes. The main area is dark and intimate but the other area has natural light and a fireplace They always have a special dish or dishes of the week."}
{"text":"I've been here over a dozen times and each time they're 5 stars.  I try something new each time and it's always unbelievably mouth watering and delicious!  The queso dip is the best in the city!  The portion size is bigger than avg. The prices are spot on for what your get and definitely worth it. Not cheap, not expensive.  Service is always fast and friendly.  Not hipster, not trendy. Just awesome food and great service."}
{"text":"Apparently I'm late to the party on this one, but my first visit to Sierra Bonita Grill was last weekend for brunch. I'm hesitant to add another good review of this great place because I didn't have to fight anyone for a table, and I would like to be able get one in the future.  Anyway... I'm a huge fan of brunch (and especially of Mexican/Latin American-type brunches), so I was thrilled to try this place. My friend ordered the Verde Vaqueros, which are their verison of biscuits and gravy. But the biscuits are no ordinary biscuits, they're Green chile beer biscuits (!) with smoked sausage gravy from Schreiners. The biscuits were delicious. I could eat them with anything... or really without anything else. My friend cleaned his plate. I got the stacked chicken enchiladas because I'm a sucker for anything with hatch chiles, and they did not disappoint. The sauce was flavorful, and the crispy tortillas were a nice texture contrast to the rest of the dish.  Will definitely be back, and would definitely recommend that people check this place out for brunch... just don't take my table."}
{"text":"First time diner, but already planning future visits! Have nothing but praise for this place thus far. Food, drinks, service, and atmosphere was fantastic! Dessert was divine too, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place a real surprise.  Excellent menu.  Excellent service and a very nice, telluride type of decor.  We will be back!  Btw, one of the best flavored burgers I have had in a very, very long time."}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite family restaurant! The Pork Ossu Buco is amazing, the meat falls off the bone. The buttermilk chicken is the perfect blend of sweet potatoes, gravy and chicken.   Not to mention they have a cool bar and a great patio. They have plenty of margaritas and Mexican beers to choose from, my favorite is the \"Margarita Chingon\" made by Kenny.   Nobody in the neighborhood can beat this place, nobody!!"}
{"text":"We went to Phoenix for spring break from Michigan, this is where we had the best food by far! The entire experience was amazing it was so good we went a second time before we left! We recommend everything!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant for an Independence Day pre-fireworks dinner. The whole dining experience was delightful. We had the pork roast, the chicken and the trout. The pork was melt in your mouth  yummy. The asparagus with the chicken was absolutely exquisite. The trout had wonderful flavor. Add to that the $4 specials on drinks and dessert, and we all left the restaurant well satisfied. The waitress was very pleasant and efficient. Overall, this was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband a few times and tried several small plates and entrees including the green and red chile pork. All items were delicious including the carne asada tacos. But that queso dip and the Frito pork pie appetizers are just slammin'! Try the margaritas--they are so fresh!"}
{"text":"I'd driven by this place a few times and wanted to try it.  When my adorable uncle and his partner came to town, I jumped at the chance to give it a go.  I made a reservation on opentable (it being a Friday night and all) and was glad I did.  The parking lot was full and people were milling about out front.  We were sat right away.  The place seems a little small but has a great layout and decor.  The menu was small and unique.  I can't remember what everyone had but my uncle had a dish with an espresso and vanilla bean sauce on the protein.  It sounded weird but he raved over it.  I had the pork loin and cleaned my plate.  We started out with guac and when we ran out of chips, they offered more.  For dessert, the chocolate torte was super yummy.  The gelato trio was good too.  I'm so happy to live near such a great restaurant!  We'd been having really bad luck with restaurants lately...thank you to Sierra Bonita for breaking the streak!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun place but can be a pain to find parking!  That kept me from eating there a couple of times.  Great Southwest food.  Their brunch is better than most.  They also have 2 very nice conference rooms downstairs if you need a place to have a meeting.  They are also much more reasonable than those places in Scottsdale.    The staff is great and the bartenders have a sense of humor."}
{"text":"This place is always a great dining experience . The three types of salsa and chips w guacamole was outstanding . The buttermilk chicken is my favorite and I love the sweet mashed potatoes  ; , and of course the buttermilk pie for dessert . My friends had carne asada and loved it .  This is a quaint , friendly place. Treat yourself to a great meal here and leave happy ! Never had anything but   excellent service here !"}
{"text":"Yelp leads me to another hot spot.    1st course: Sizzlin'  Peppers: Jalapenos stuffed with panela cheese, goat cheese and Menonita cheese  So good yet so simple.  The variety of cheeses were great flavor to the grilled jalapeno.  2nd course: Sergio's Pork Tenderloin: Chocolate-espresso rubbed served with vegetables and roasted potatoes. Finished with a vanilla bean serrano butter sauce  This was due to the high reviews from other yelpers and I thank you because it was amazing.  The sauce was great and complimented the veggies and pork so well.  The tenderloin was cooked perfectly fork tender and the chocolate-espresso rub was a nice flavor.  3rd course: Croissant Bread Pudding Jack Daniels whiskey lime / caramel sauce  I was looking for a reason to be full and not order dessert but one specific review was just due to this dessert so I had to try it.  It was a different twist to bread pudding due to the pastry vs. soaked bread but it was tender and tasted wonderful.  I totally recommend it.    Overall Sierra Bonita grill was a great restaurant and I will totally be coming back for happy hour as they have appetizer discounts and drink specials."}
{"text":"Brunch? I had no idea they served brunch! I can't remember the name of the brunch item I ordered, but I've been trying to emulate it at home without success ever since. Anyway, it involved two fried corn tortillas smothered with refried beans, green chili sauce, and a fried egg. I ordered a cup of pozole to start because it was a little cold outside and a spicy cup of soup sounded good and it did not disappoint. All components of my meal were great and so was the service. I will not let a year pass between visits next time."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Had the buttermilk fried chicken with the mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus and it is to die for. Comfort food for sure. Not too crazy about their brunch menu because you must order off of that and not the regular menu. Their guacamole and warm chips are also a yummy must! This is a great place to take out of town guests because there is nothing like it anywhere else."}
{"text":"WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?! I was here 1 year ago and I LOVED this place!! What one short year can do in the quality of their food!! I fell in love with their chicken tortilla soup, which is named the Aztec Soup here 1 year ago, and I was so excited to come back and have it again, just to find ONE BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!  Food:  1) Aztec soup: WAY TOOO SALTY!!! I could barely finish half the soup, I was downing so much water in attempts to wash out all the salt I was ingesting! Why was the soup so salty?!?! Do they even taste the soup? My friends ordered the same soup and they felt it was WAY TOO SALTY too, so it wasn't just me! Not only was it too salty, but it was in a smaller bowl, there were less ingredients, it was just all wrong and SO different from what I remembered 1 year ago! Major disappointment! 2) Pan seared fish (forgot what type of fish): This dish was pretty good, but for the price, the portions could have been a little more generous. 3) Cobb salad: pretty decent, ingredients tasted pretty fresh 4) Guacamole and chips: good guacamole, chunky, just how I like it.   Service:  Nice and friendly waitress. Not very attentive to refill my water, but that's just probably because I needed so much water from the intensely salty soup.  Ambiance:  It's a dimly lit, romantic ambiance type place. It feels like a fancier, fine dining type place. Overall, very neat and clean, comfortable place to dine in.   Price:  Our meal cost us ~$90, which I think was NOT WORTH it, considering the highlight of my meal was supposed to be the soup and it was such a big let down.   Overall:  I was actually planning on coming here TWICE during my trip here, but after coming here ONCE and tasting that awful salty soup, I decided not to come here a second time during my short trip to Phoenix. I think the soup is forever ruined for me, I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I cant believe Sierra hasn't gotten more 5stars (Lauren, how dare you?) This place is great. Strong drinks, good wine, Kiltlifter on tap. No joke, I like every appetizer,but honey child, it dont stop there. Azteca soup? BOMB. Yummy burgers, carna asada, and so many of my friends favorite, buttermilk chicken with mashed sweet potatoes! I tired scallops for the first time at this place, and was not disappointed, i crave them all the time now. Everyone who works here is friendly and very helpful. I always sit at the bar, (cause I'm that kind of people,) and I notice that there are always alot of regulars who keep coming back ,which is a good sign. I work down the street from the restaurant, and whenever a client ask where to go for lunch,dinner, or happy hour I only, and always, suggest Sierra Bonita."}
{"text":"Very good food!  We all enjoyed our meals tremendously!  I have 4 stars instead of 5 only because once we got our food our server wasn't around much.  She was a lot more attentive at the beginning."}
{"text":"I can't believe I lice down the street and this was my first visit.  This place has a great abeyance well decorated and very comfortable.  The food was on point, I had brunch which I really enjoyed  ! The staff was very friendly and the owner stopped over to greet us to assure we we happy. I will most definitely return, my new home to spot when I'm not at my restaurant.  Keep up standards,  see you again soon."}
{"text":"I cannot put into words how impressed I was with Sierra Bonita! Absolutely everything about this place is epic! We went in on a Saturday night and were seated almost immediately which was a relief since it's such a busy night for restaurants. Our waiter promptly came over to our table and was super polite, well-spoken, and knew the entire menu off of memory. My husband and I brought another couple with us and we all had different dishes. We all tried each other's and were in food heaven. Everything was perfection. I had the buttermilk chicken which is one of their most popular items. It has a bit of a kick to it so be for warned. The sweet potatoes are the icing on the cake for this dish. Another if us had the carne asada and it was too notch quality meat! It burst with flavor. We always enjoyed their black tea and some wine. The prices are fantastic for the quality you get here. The ambiance is candles and soft lighting with light background music. The wood decor throughout the restaurant finishes setting the scene and makes you feel at home and comfortable. I recommend geting the smaller portions being that it's still a lot of food! I can't wait to go back here ago. And bring new friends! It is a MUST go!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good.  Appetizers a little bit expensive for what you get- tiny cup of guacamole, 4 shrimp wrapped in bacon.  They were excellent though.  Fish tacos made with your choice from the fresh fish list- halibut was really good.  My plate was made gluten free by using corn tortillas and vegetables instead of beans.  We had not wait on a Wed night and service was great. Oh and the cadillac margarita was really good too!"}
{"text":"The Buttermilk Chicken was so amazing! It comes with mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus. It has a lot of great and unique flavors and the texture of the chicken was perfect! We also had a quesadilla and the Green Chili Mac n cheese for appetizers and they were amazing! Can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"I can not even explain how much I love this place.  Their carne asada is the most amazing I have ever had.  Their guacamole/salsa trio is sooooo good.  The cowboy stew is to die for.  Even their buttermilk fried chicken with chipotle mashed sweet potatoes is wonderful.  I've moved to California in the past year and I miss this place sooooo much."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience! The stuffed jalapeno appetizers were amazing, we had four of us for dinner, we all ordered 4 different main dishes and they were amazing! The bread pudding was a great way to end the night! I must say the owner of this establishment was a very nice guy, he came by the table to see how we were doing! We will return for sure."}
{"text":"I went to Sierra Bonita for brunch yesterday and must say it was pretty good. I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, checked out their menu online and decided to go. One disappointment....the prices they show on the website are not reflective of the real prices at all.... it showed 6$ for pancakes, but in the restaurant they are 10$...this is not an unreasonable price or anything, but I wish they would update their site so I wouldn't have been surprised. Anyway, the husband and I ate on the 'patio,' which is more like an Arizona room...it's indoors and has a fireplace, pretty cute set up. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly. The coffee was good and our waiter, seeing that the husband looked a little sickly (sunday morning...you do the math), he brought him a complimentary coffee drink...very nice! He got the pancakes, which were a nice balance of sweet and savory. They are blue corn pancakes with pine nuts and strawberry butter. I got the chile relleno, which was very tasty. The pepper was spicy and the filling consisted of cheese, chorizo, onion and potato...it had a creamy sauce and some pico on top along with over medium eggs....was tasty, but I wish the eggs were more runny (the yolks were almost hard). The flavor was good, though. Overall, I thought the food was good, the service was good, but it was a bit overpriced. I would go back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Best food in town. I  their brunch. Bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's on Sundays, the service is on point, Sarah, Chelsea, and Robert are amazing, and on point. Monte Cristo, carne asada tacos, hoppers poppers! All amazing."}
{"text":"This is really sad for me.  I wrote a glowing review earlier and they really deserved it.  But today it was as if it was not the same place at all.  Apparently because I requested a male server we where treated rudely.  WOW.  Write a great review and them be treated in a way that clearly said \"don't come back.\"   I am still a bit shocked."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. (However my first was with a group & limited to 3 choices for lunch. It was very good.) This visit was even better. I tried the daily special of blackened grouper with some type of corn cakes. WOW! Good wine list and accommodating server to let me try a taste before choosing a glass.  My husband had the carne asada tacos which were perfectly cooked sliced steak. He couldn't even finish but brought it home. They also have a beautiful room downstairs available to reserve (party of 8) with no room charge. This place will certainly be added to our favorites on the rotation when going out (lunch or dinner). Great food, great service in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada plate that came with beans and rice, very tasty but not worth it for the price they're a little pricey there. The atmosphere  of the place was very calm, service was great."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago for brunch because of a coupon we had from a playing card deck with restaurant discounts. We had never been before but the menu looked delicious. We got there pretty much when they opened on a Sunday and sat at a table in their \"outside\" patio. It is enclosed but very sunny and airy. I ordered the stacked chicken enchiladas with a fried egg on top. It was AMAZING! Somehow I managed to eat the entire plate without any hesitation. Uh, it was so good. The balance of sauce and cheese was just perfect and felt light despite that it was enchiladas.   We ordered the cinnamon roll for my daughter and that was fantastic, too. She didn't enjoy it as much as we did, though, but we didn't mind finishing it for her. The cream cheese frosting was melt in your mouth yummy. I also had a sangria but as I recall, it was just okay. But no matter, as we were there to try the food.   The service was great, too. As we were leaving, it began getting packed. Clear sign that this was the place to be on a Sunday morning...."}
{"text":"We showed up at 6 pm on a Saturday night, party of 8, no reservation. It was busy, but no one waiting for a seat. They were able to clean a couple tables and quickly put them together for us. Service was great, as was the food - trout, salmon, osso bucco, etc. Great mix of flavors and we enjoyed how the food was cooked although some might find it more on the well done side."}
{"text":"Horrible experience altogether. It started from the Valet! They were not there when we arrived, so we parked and then they showed up as we were walking in (and no, they were not anywhere parking any cars, they were simply MIA) and demanded we handed them our keys (and no we were not blocking anyone). Glasses the wines were served in reeked of stains and lipsticks!!!! Fajita was served in a cast iron pan but was at room temperature! I warned them about food being cold, they took it back and returned it with the cast iron pan sizzling.....and the food remained COLD! SERIOUSLY???!!!!! It was a complete waste of time and $$$!"}
{"text":"fantastic food, especially the chile cream corn. Had fish tacos"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to breakfast when visiting Phoenix, but I swear things have changed recently. The most recent time I went the dishes weren't as flavorful as I remember. The service was still great, but really I come for the food! I'll give it another try soon and update if anything changes."}
{"text":"Well as promised I have an update... Sierra Bonita customer service reached out after I posted my review. I provided my phone number and received a call from the owner Nate. He was very apologetic and offered a free lunch or dinner for myself and a friend  if I wanted. I decided on the Verde macaroni and cheese, osso bucco, and bread pudding. When I arrived he also threw in a pozole to replace my original order. Nate seemed very sincere in his apology and displayed outstanding customer service. The macaroni was great but what made it amazing was the Verde salsa! I could almost eat that by itself! The osso bucco was so tender and flavour filled I will definitely need to try that again. They also have one of the best bread pudding that I have ever had!... and the Posole was great!"}
{"text":"I loved it. Sierra Bonita is a must try. We invited our family and everyone raved about how great the food is and they want to come back and bring others. I like the fact the chips are optional. We ordered chips and Guac and the chips were perfectly crisp and the guacamole was so fresh and yummy. My husband can't stop raving about the Smoked Red Chili Pork Roast . Reminded me of a dish my mom used to make and was one of my favorites growing up. I was boring and ordered a salad and tamale, but the salad and tamale was light and delicious.  I will for sure come back again."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Devoured Phoenix!! We learned about this place last spring at the food festival and couldn't be happier. This is probably, most definitely, my new favorite place in all of Phoenix. The food.... the service... the ambience... all of it. Hubs and I stopped in for brunch and enjoyed the griddled cinnamon roll spiced delicately with a great smear of creamy topping; the homestyle posole with tender chunks of pork and a green broth that will bring me back again and again; the pork tamale - I cannot say enough good things about this delicacy; and the breakfast enchiladas - yum!!! BTW, restrooms were super clean too. Don't dilly dally about, get there as quick as possible and enjoy their menu. I dare you not to love them."}
{"text":"Love this bbq place and love that it's local.  Sometimes you can smell the meat cooking as you drive by.  The carne asada is really good and it's nice to be able to use Open Table for reservations.  Nice atmosphere and some really good grill."}
{"text":"Food 4 stars Parking 1 star Atmosphere 4 stars Close to my pad 5 stars  How else do you fine tune the star system? But let's focus on food which gets a high rating. Guests and I only had appetizers and drinks last night, so we'll focus on that. Guacamole Dip with Chips:  Pura Vida....the pure life. Let the \"Guac\" talk, pure and simple, just right, not too much onion, garlic very well spiced and a healthy portion served with 3 yum-liscious salsas. I liked the green one. Quesadillas   I was expecting the usual flour tortillas and cheese but no. These were absolutely delightful! Corn not flour, lightly stuffed with two types of cheese, spinach and served with 3 salsas. I loved them and hogged them by eating 2 of the 3 on the plate.  We sat outdoors and it was a bit chilly but there was a fireplace and it made things pleasant. Atmosphere is great there.   Best part....friends picked up the tab! All the best"}
{"text":"I had heard and read so many good things about Sierra Bonita I was excited to finally get a chance to go with my brother & sis in law for her birthday. A first glance the place is impressive. It's quaint with a cowboy, southwestern style interior. When arriving everyone was nice and pleasant. It kinda of goes downhill from there.  My husband asked if he could have chips and salsa. Waitress informs us they only have guacamole, it comes with chips and a salsa trio. Husband didn't want guacamole..only chips and salsa. She brings chips and salsa, but still charges us $9..same price as the guac with the chips and salsa.  I ordered the Wild Salmon. If I could base this review on just the sides it would have gotten 5 stars. The poblano creamed corn was amazing but there wasn't enough of it, maybe a tablespoon, 2 at best. The roasted yukon gold potatoes were roasted perfectly, the only thing they were missing was salt. Easy fix though, right? The salmon was a nice thick piece of fish ever so slightly overcooked, it was supposed to have a red chile glaze, but the glaze had a very floral taste that just didn't work with the fish, at least not for me.   The husband had the Enchiladas Suiza, with carne instead of chicken. They looked good, he said they were ok. Wished he could have that meat in a Filibertos burrito..would be heaven. His words not mine.  The child had kid's mac & cheese. Was an order of oily penne pasta with a sprinkle of some sort of cheese on top..he didn't eat it.   When our bill arrived we asked if it could be split. Gratuity was already added to the total, thats ok there were several of us,but my problem is when she split the ticket 3 ways she added gratuity again..double the tip...I don't think so.  The poblano creamed corn was the highlight of my meal and I would have been a happy camper with a large bowl of it, but the $80 price tag for enchiladas, salmon, chips & salsa, oily penne and 3 non-alcoholic drinks, plus the tax & tip was a little too much for our liking.  Not sure if we will return to Sierra Bonita."}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere and the service. The food was very good. More of a place to go with friends and not just a Saturday night family dinner."}
{"text":"I hosted a small baby shower brunch in their downstairs room. Everything was perfect. I made arrangements with Tony who was super professional and accommodating. Every staff member from the host to our server and bartender was friendly and helpful. The food was amazing and the atmosphere perfection. This restaurant is a small gem of Phoenix and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Bumped into John Shadegg here Friday night, but this is still a reputable restaurant. The southwest cuisine has some zip and is broadly well executed. Table service is efficient,  but can be cool.     Dinner entrees and specials lean pricey, so I usually go for a green chile burger with a side of Azteca soup.  Conventional, but both elements are sizable, delicious and a relative steal at $11. The burger is a half pound of chuck, well dressed with a spongy roll. The soup is a spicy chicken tortilla variation with some subtle hints.  It's a satisfying plate for about the cost of my wife's 4 oz glass of vino.   If they had interesting beer on draught, like a really nice IPA, and more charming servers, this might be five star territory.  p.s. - sunday brunch is not a buffet, but the menu's inventive, elegant and delicious. Recommended."}
