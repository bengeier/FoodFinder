{"text":"This new donburi place is amazing! The buta fire is a perfect combination of flavours and this was indeed the best donburi I had so far in Toronto. It tasted like there was a lot of thoughts put into the bowl to create the perfect mix of flavours and I enjoyed every part of my meal. My boyfiend got sakedon which was also very nice, they give generous amount of salmon pieces that were very fresh. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves Japanese cuisine and is looking to experience high quality donburis. So excited to try out the other menus on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I decided to come here due to the high ratings on yelp and the great pictures but I was disappointed. I got the sake lover and while the food looked good visually, the sashimi was a bit lacking. The pieces were pretty thin and it was stringey which is not what you want from your sashimi. I couldn't bite into the sashimi because it was tough."}
{"text":"Hidden gem near yonge and bloor. Great lunch spot! I love the open kitchen concept of this restaurant.  Food 4.5/5 (sauce and pickles were abit too sweet for my taste but overall very well balanced flavors with fresh ingredients).  Portion 5/5 (size of salmon pieces were big and overall portion was very good for lunch)  Price 4.5/5 average price for lunch.   Service 5/5 (quick service and waitresses were very attentive)  Waittime 5/5 (was able to sit right away with no wait time)  Menu 4/5 (wish they have more additional 1 or 2 types of donburi since their specialty is 'donburi')  Will I come back? Yeah definitely."}
{"text":"Had the sake lover don and karaage for a quick lunch today and definitely the hype lives up to its name.  Salmon was melt in your mouth with a slight seat with the heat from the rice which added a nice texture. Karaage was crispy on the outside with a soft meaty texture inside.  Overall, an amazing food experience in the Yorkville area (note water is self serve during lunch)"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to check this place out for a long time and we finally got to check it out over the lunch hour on a Friday.  We arrived around 12:40pm  and there were a few people ahead of us and we waited ~10 minutes to be seated.  It's a pretty casual joint and the seating is either facing the open kitchen or the side wall with bar stools.  Tip: if you want tap water just help yourself from the counter toward the front of the restaurant on the left hand side.   I ordered the Buta Fire donburi.  The pork belly was grilled really well and marinated perfectly.   The tartness from the pickled vegetables paired perfectly with the hearty pork belly.  It was a great portion size - there was actually quite a number of pork belly pieces and there wasn't too much rice.  Would definitely make a return visit to try the other donburis."}
{"text":"I was tricked by the lovely lit food photos, the cute bowls, and the minimalist interior design. I had the Sake bowl, and Ebi Fry. The salmon in the Sake bowl was fine, it's the accoutrements that has me incensed. The Japanese rice was still a bit hot, and they combined it with too much vinegar that it was soggy. Also threw some soy sauce on it to increase the soggy-ness of the rice. Then topped it with cold mayo (!!?!??) and thinly sliced raw white onions (super weird, trying to mask the fish?). Then salmon on top, and also sliced pickles (not the Japanese kind, more like dill pickle kind), pink ginger, tempura bits and red tobiko. So so disappointed and confused about this.  The ebi fry was nothing to write home about. They again drizzled mayo on top. Adding Japanese mayo to food doesn't make it authentic."}
{"text":"Onnki is a very open concept, intimate restaurant with limited seating. Unfortunately, when I visited, they were doing kitchen maintenance, so all they had available was the sake lover (fortunately, I am a huge salmon sashimi lover) which was fresh salmon sashimi on a bed of white rice topped with wasabi mayo, pickles, pickled ginger, wasabi and green onion. The flavours paired so well together, as I would never think to put pickles with my salmon bowl, however the portion was quite small for me, as I was still hungry after.  Gladly, I will visit again to try other dishes I have heard so many great reviews on.    @eatingwithv"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try out this place out for a while and it did not disappoint! Onnki Donburi is a bit hidden, it was down an alleyway, but it was not difficult to find!   My friend and I arrived around 12:30pm, it looked full upon arrival. However, we were seated fairly quickly. I would not recommend here for large groups of people, since there were just bar seating. The inside of the restaurant is clean and minimal, with an open kitchen.   The menu is very straightforward, as they didn't have a large menu. My friend ordered the buta fire and I had the salmon sake, along with a side of karaage. Everything was delicious! The salmon sake had a great amount of salmon, I felt like there was a higher ratio of salmon to rice. The salmon was fresh and didn't taste fishy. The rice was cooked and seasoned perfectly. However, the ginger was a bit overpowering for me, I would had preferred less ginger. Also I just removed the wasabi, since I can't handle it. The karaage was crispy and the chicken was soft and succulent on the inside.   The portions are pretty standard, it was filling, but it won't make you feel stuffed. Just don't come here starving like I did, I definitely had more room for more food.   Overall, I had a great experience here, I would definitely recommend Onnki Donburi to others!"}
{"text":"This cute hidden place on Hayden Street was really good. Their menu is quite limited though. I ordered the unagi rice bowl with egg and it was bomb. The price was high for a small bowl but it comes with a lot of unagi which made up for it. The order came up to around 20$ It's a good place to grab a quick bite on your own. Can't wait to come back and try the pork belly."}
{"text":"Onnki Donburi is really a Korean-Japanese fusion restaurant. I had the buta red fire donburi and found it to be exactly like the spicy pork dishes at typical Korean restaurants. I was really hoping for a more authentic Japanese-style donburi so I was a bit disappointed. Other than that, I thought the portions and overall flavour were good."}
{"text":"The food had great presentation in unique donburi bowls. The food would've been better if the rice wasn't undercooked. It was a busy restaurant with a high turnover of customers so I am guessing they were running behind on cooked rice. It was otherwise a pleasant experience. Fast service, friendly and clean environment. I would give it another visit."}
{"text":"For a place that supposedly specializes in \"rice bowls\", their rice was inedibly bad. It was totally hard and undercooked. The flavours were okay but that hardly matters when the rice taste like rocks. There were also bones in the salmon. The prices are too high considering what you actually get, especially the for the shrimp bowl, three tiny shrimps with some rice and it's $14? This entire experience was so disappointing for a restaurant that claims to serve the \"ultimate donburi\", I am cringing so hard at all these false claims on their social media pages. Definitely would not recommend.  --EDIT-- I love how two 5-star reviews showed up within 15 minutes of each other after my review, and both of them praised the quality of the rice, something that is usually not worth mentioning but they had to try to discredit my claims. Both of those 5-star reviews are also the first reviews left by those two accounts. It would appear that both of those accounts were created today as well. Not fishy at all..."}
{"text":"Seaweed was excellent. We started with miso soup and ordered Ebi Don and Buta Fire as main dishes."}
{"text":"I don't review often usually because places already have a bunch of reviews but this place deserves some props. I got the galbi and although the price seems a bit high, there's a generous amount of meat given. Tastes great too!"}
{"text":"We came here on a weekend for lunch. The space is small, casual and cute. There weren't any other customers there, but they were quite busy with online orders. Despite that, service was good and prompt. Prices were between 10-12 per dish.  I had the salmon bowl, which I enjoyed. The sausage curry comes with one of those big oscar mayer sausages with cheese inside, but they score so it has many small cubes, and then they fry that to a crisp. I thought that it could have been better with a regular pork/chicken katsu, but my husband enjoyed the sausage.   We'd definitely come back, or order from here."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch was pretty quiet.  Got the sake Don which is raw salmon was pretty good but portion was small.  Quality of fish was fresh thou.  Not sure if I will come back as I was still hungry after."}
{"text":"A neat place in downtown with good food! It would be even better if there were more choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Quietly tucked away in Hayden Street, this don place is perfect for lunch and dinner in the Yonge/Bloor area! Simple white and natural wood colour décor with gray flooring keeps it modern and clean. Since discovering the spot, it seems they've picked up fast on Ritual. Miso soups and don bowls were flying into their takeout boxes and crowds of people came in to pick up their orders. The open concept kitchen lets you see everything, and the bar stool benches for dining in provide a hybrid of intimacy and community unique to small shops such as these (think ramen shop, but modern décor). What brings us back is definitely the convenience and so far, the no-complaints about the menu items.   We were craving dons and this spot popped up. It was a late weeknight, activity was slow, the place was quiet and calm. We picked out the Japanese curry don (update: not on the menu currently in Jan 2018) and their signature Buta Fire don. We also got their karaage to top up the meal. It was a bit of a wait, but we did see the kitchen progressing and felt reassured. The karaage is crunch and flavourful, moist and served hot - no complaints. The curry don I got vegetarian, which was more than sufficient as we had the karaage as well. The curry sauce was flavourful and just the right level of spice for me (basically mild kick) which meant I could still taste the other flavours. The Buta Fire comes topped with tons of pork, and also has a small kick of spice to round out its flavour. Both dons were satisfying and immediately made it on the roster of go-to meals near the office.  Recent visit rotated out the curry don and was replaced by the sake lover - salmon and wasabi, a deconstructed salmon maki roll almost. Lots of salmon sashimi, a good amount of wasabi (more than I needed) and rice with cabbage, crisps, and mayo. It wasn't as refreshing as expected, but satisfied the \"I want sushi\" craving while still being a filling meal."}
{"text":"A coworker had recommended this place so we came here for the lunch. It's a small restaurant with a bright clean vibe with wooden table and chair's where you dine at the bar and open concept so you see the chefs preparing food. The menu was small the size of a long sheet/shopping list with about 10 types of donburi to choose from. I ordered something like a beef donburi and my friend a salmon sashimi rice bowl. Both were nicely presented and tasted yummy. Just the perfect portion. I would come back."}
{"text":"Small place with only a few options but definitely still worth trying. Food tasted pretty good and was presented very nicely. Exceeded my overall expectations."}
{"text":"Very delicious Sake Lover. Salmon was super fresh and it melts in my mouth. Sake Lover contains fresh salmon sashimi, onion, and wasabi. Onion were raw but it's very good when eaten together with rice and salmon. This was my first time here and I had a great experience. The waitress was patient and explained the menu thoroughly. I also ordered Onnki Karaage which is super tasty as well. The price of the Karaage was not expensive at all ($4.9) and it comes in 6 pieces. Seatings are a bit limited and water was self serve. There were no coat racks. I have to place my jacket on the seat next to me. Overall, the food was above expectation. Price is low to moderate. Store atmosphere was bright and welcoming."}
{"text":"This small Japanese restaurant tucked away in a quiet street. I love the vibe and decor here! I'm in love with their sake lover dish as well. I've been here twice, and I usually get their takoyaki ($7.5) and sake lover ($13.5). If you like their Facebook page, you get a free pop as well. The service is good, and the food is fresh and is quick to come."}
{"text":"It is a decent fast casual place. Food is good no matter what you order but I wish portion was larger."}
{"text":"Two star is for the taste of the curry. Ordered a kare don (curry rice) to go, by the time I get to my work place the rice is soaked with the curry.   So what I got for $10 white rice and curry. Make sure to add chicken for $3 cause if you don't read carefully u end up eating the rice with curry. That guy should have asked all customer if they want to add the chicken.   Not worth it if is $10 lunch.I feel like I got scam.Should have get the sake lover for 12.99.  The taste of the curry is ok but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a couple of friends. It is located on a very quiet street, but is easy to find. Seems like it is already quite popular as a takeout spot because when we were there, there was a small crowd waiting for their takeout. We were seated right away however, but since there were so many orders for takeout, we waited for a while. The decor in the restaurant is minimalistic but I love the wooden trays and chopsticks they have! When the food finally came, we definitely found it was worth the wait! I got the Sake Lover, and my friends got the Galbi Don and the Buta Fire (pork belly) ones. We all loved our bowls and the portions were a good size for lunch. The only thing is that they put a lot of raw onions in my salmon bowl, and I personally don't like raw onions much, so I was trying to avoid them. Ask for no onions if you are like me! Overall, I had a very pleasant experience, and I will definitely come again, but it was a bit pricey for somewhere to visit regularly."}
{"text":"As mentioned in the previous review, the rice was indeed so undercooked and hard that I did not enjoy the meal at all. Hope this place can do something about that and improve in the future for the sake of their business being successful."}
{"text":"I went onkki donburi yesterday with my friend. I had galbi don and my friend had salmon don. Both meals are very delicious and fresh. I know there are not many good donburi house in toronto But you can have real donburi here. Just luv it"}
{"text":"They had a fire buta bowl on special during Ritual's eats week and I jumped on the deal. I picked it up from the restaurant and saved it for lunch next days it was delicious! The sauce complimented the dish very well and the pork belly was absolutely delightful. Though it was quite delicious, I would not have paid full price for it..."}
{"text":"Onki Donburi is a little difficult to find.  Trust me, don't go by your Google maps, as there is construction and it will tell you to traverse several buildings.  Loop around church and follow the narrow path called Hayden until you see a spa parlour. Onki Donburi is next to it.   However, once you do find it, you'll enjoy the interior design.  The white and brown colour palette creates a chic yet minimalistic impression. For all you fellow clean freaks, the washrooms are spotless and organized as well. They even have an open kitchen, which is refreshing.  Just don't expect any performances, so I wouldn't encourage you to scramble to get a seat in front of the  kitchen.   In terms of seating, you will only have the option of high top seating in rows. Since you won't be able to sit across from your party members, Onki is not suitable for medium to large sized parties that enjoy lively conversation among multiple members across the table. The best you will be able to do is speak to the person on either side of you, so this establishment is perfect for a date or a 2-3 person party.  Now, in terms of the food, don't set a high bar even though Onki Donburi is trending. Last Friday, my friend and I were a little disappointed with our meals. The dishes were not terrible; they were just decent.  For example, we ordered the Onki Karaage and I found the breading to be thicker than average, which took away from the potential juiciness of the chicken flesh. Also, we ordered the Buta Fire and the Buta Red Fire to compare the two since we were told that the Buta Red Fire was the spicy version of the other.  Unfortunately, the sauce that differentiated the fire one from the other was sweet, not spicy, so I was crestfallen. On the bright side, there was a good ratio of meat to carbs, which is something to appreciate since a lot of establishments tend to be less generous with their portions of meat. Overall, however, the rice bowls were flavourful, but their flavours weren't complex and by all means they weren't  memorable.  I wouldn't say you should go ham over this restaurant if you're out of the area because there are better alternatives out there.  However, if you're in the area, Onki Donburi is a pleasant spot to hit up with a friend or date if you're craving for Japanese grub that isn't sushi or ramen. At least try it once, I say."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sake Lover through Ritual for pick-up. There was a generous amount of salmon on top of cooked onions and rice. It was tasty and satisfying - I definitely want to try the Galbi and Buta options eventually."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite in Yorkville that's affordable and tasty. The menu is limited, but don't let the limited options detract you. There's a variety of protein options from fresh salmon to pork belly. You can also get Japanese curry if you want something hearty. Everything is cooked to order, even the kaarage is battered and fried fresh on the spot.   There's limited seating, despite the large waiting area. You could easily grab your food to go. A great option for lunch or dinner, if you're feeling some Japanese food."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say ! Had the buta fire (pork belly) and ordered the chicken appetizer and shrimp appetizer.  Service was fast and friendly. Can't wait to visit again"}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious Japanese bowls at a reasonable price! Friendly staff, and you get to watch the chef in action at a counter facing the kitchen."}
{"text":"We got the buta fire and the sake lover for takeout and the wait wasn't too bad at 6pm on a Thursday evening. Both were pretty tasty, though the Buta Fire was more flavourful in comparison to the salmon sashimi bowl. The pork belly were well seasoned and there was a good meat to rice ratio. However, for the portion size, the prices were kind of high - but to be expected in any fast food restaurant downtown.   If I lived closer, would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the decor is aesthetically simple, and the service was friendly. I tried the sakedon and it was very tasty, plus the portion was generous. The karage was great too!"}
{"text":"Great place! I came here with two friends on a Thursday evening, and thankfully it wasn't busy - we were seated right away.  All the seats are bar seats, no tables, so it's a little uncomfortable for a group larger than 3 to have a conversation, if not impossible. But why talk when you're busy eating good food?!  We ordered the karaage, fried shrimp, and sake lover.  The karaage was actually one of the juiciest karaage I've had in a looooong time. It was crispy and seasoned well too.  The fried shrimps were also good, a little crispy, a little sticky too from the sauce. The shrimp chips were a great touch - added extra crispness and flavor! You could say it's a gimmick since without the shrimp chips it wasn't a remarkable dish but I still enjoyed the combination nonetheless.  The sake lover was great. The salmon tasted fresh, and the pickled ginger and cucumber went well to balance the fattiness of the shrimp - typical combination but still good :') overall very wholesome and filling.  The atmosphere was nice and the service was very friendly too. I recommend!"}
{"text":"I want to live here. I love this place.   Onnki is a very elongated but tiny place. Every seat is a bar seat. There are no tables. I thought it's really cute of them to adopt the Japanese fast food culture so well. They blast top 40 from their speakers.   I had a katsu don (fried pork cutlet on rice with fried egg) and my dude had an ebi don (garlic butter shrimp on rice with egg).   OOOOOOMG the katsu had the PERFECT ratio of batter and meat. The batter didn't fall or peel away. It stuck onto the meat and the meat was juicy. The way they seasoned the egg with nori was amazing too. Not too salty, a hint of pepper, and the nori elevates the taste to a complexity that can only be described as \"sublime\".  The shrimp was really good too! I mean, you can't go wrong with garlic butter, but it wasn't oily and you didn't feel like you had a coat of oil after eating. The egg was sunny side up, so mixing the egg in the rice really made it great because this egg was seasoned the same way.   DEF recommend this place. It's tiny and a little hidden in an alley, but it's great. Be ready to squeeze in next to a stranger and make a new friend because this place is tiny."}
{"text":"To start off, I just absolute love donburi bowls. Or maybe I just love rice. It's such a versatile base to eat anything with, and almost everything works wonderfully well with it. Onnki Donburi does Donburi super well. The mixture of toppings in terms of flavours and textures hits the spot. It warms your soul and makes you happy. I'm super glad we stumbled into this gem of a place.   Came here with my partner in crime on a Friday night before Friday Night Live ROM, and lucked out because we beat the rush at around 6:30 before the massive waves of people started to arrive.  The first thing you see when you step in is the incredibly simple, clean, and minimalistic aesthetic with an open kitchen with no tables at all. Enjoying your food being made in front of you was a joy to watch and stimulates all those salivary glands. Everything about this place was cute; especially their colourful ceramic bowls.   We went with the karaage, their buta red fire, and sake lover don all which were delightful. The karaage was super crispy and was drizzled with a creamy mayo. I personally loved the extra crunch while my partner found it so crispy that it was on the hard side. The chicken was still very much juicy and that's all I could ever ask for in karaage; juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The sake don is an absolute must order if you enjoy salmon sashimi. There's crunchiness from the tempura bits and a whole lot of sweetness and creaminess from their sauces here. For good measure, there's even pickled ginger and wasabi; it's a very complete dish. However, I would add it might be almost too sweet since all the individual components are sweet themselves. The buta red fire was equally as excellent. Their juicy pork belly (grilled right in front of our faces) was coated with a gochujang based sauce with a nice, mild kick while the abundance of sweetened onions added a nice crispness and extra sweetness. There was also a mayo base on the rice, the extra creaminess is always a welcome addition.   Portions were just right and the excellent ratio of proteins to rice here ensured you would have just enough rice to go with your proteins. Typically other donburi restaurants would load up on the rice while cutting back on the rest of the toppings."}
{"text":"Onnki Donburi has been on my to try list for a while. While I am glad I got to try it, I don't think this place is the type of place I'd come back for very often. Bowls are around $15 with taxes and tips. While they are tasty, portions are on the smaller side and the meat bowls are on the oilier side.   We tried the salmon and the pork bowls, the salmon bowl was composed of rice topped with salmon sashimi, pickled ginger and pickled cucumber, wasabi and tempura bits. It really felt like eating an expensive (but pretty) bowl of deconstructed crunchy salmon sushi. The pork bowl on the other hand was essentially just marinated pork and rice with a couple edamame and daikon.  I would have liked to see more acidity in the bowls for a bigger punch of flavours."}
{"text":"Smaller portions than I expected for how expensive it is. I got the eel bowl and it tastes just like the pre-made frozen packs of unagi with sauce that you can buy at any Asian supermarkets."}
{"text":"I've been here twice to try the sake lover and the buta fire dons. The food arrived quite quickly (around 10-15 minutes) and the presentation looked adorable in little Japanese bowls.  The salmon lover was great, with lots of salmon on top of warm sushi rice, and the buta fire is also delicious pork on rice with some cabbage. The buta fire, however, was quite oily and was mainly pork fat. One big thing about both bowls, though, is that the portion was too little for me! The meat to rice ratio was great, but both of them were too little for me for the price (around $15 after tax). My friend had the miso soup and thought the soup was too salty.   Final verdict: I would come here if I was really craving the food, but if I wanted a full meal I'll have to go somewhere else (unless there's an extra option for upgrading my portion!)"}
{"text":"Buta Fire and Sake Lover are must try. The service was nice, but the place is not very clean. Our table smelled...And it was gross...I think next time I'll come to take out."}
{"text":"I liked the food and thought it was a decent portion for the price. It was really clean, but it's all bar seating. So, it gets packed very quickly and I noticed that a lot of the people who were coming were doing take out.  I'd go to this place if I were going with a friend and looking for some nice soul food. The meat to rice ratio was quite satisfying.  Food: 3.5/5 Service: 4/5 Price Point: 4/5 Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great ppl! Absolutely loved their sake don and ebi mayo! Their place is clean with an open kitchen! Quick-paced eatery worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Calling all pork belly lovers! This place is for you!!  For me, however, I am not a big pork belly person. But since the menu was so limited (especially during lunch time), I still opted for the pork belly don since it seemed like their signature dish. I wish they would have more options such as beef ribs or pork shoulder, etc.  The meat is cooked/seared to order in the open kitchen. The meat was flavourful and seasoned well. Very tasty. For the pork belly lovers, you'd also be satisfied with the fattiness and the portion. The don had some garnishes of marinated onion and cabbage. I wish they had a bit more of those garnishes to cut into the fattiness from the meat.   The lemon water was a nice touch to help with digesting and cleaning your palette.   Very attentive servers too!"}
{"text":"Onnki is a small little restaurant on Hayden street (just south of Yonge and Bloor).  The place is a has a wide open area and the seating is consisted of tables against the wall and seats at the bar. You can say that it wouldn't seat a large amount of people, but I think people tend to do takeout from here anyway.  I ordered the Sake Lover. It cam with salmon on a bed of rice, served with ginger and the perfect amount of wasabi. Every bite was amazing and kept me wanting more of this delicious bowl. The order came quick and was worth every penny I spent on it.  I like this place also because it gives the vibe of an eatery in Japan (as much as it can, anyway), where you sit at a bar-like setting around the kitchen and the cooks, albeit much larger than you would find in Japan.  Overall, a very good place for a quick meal with a couple friends after shopping around Bloor street."}
{"text":"No hot water, no much options, and the waitress does not listen to customer's needs properly. Food looks good, but a restaurant cannot be ran well with only few options of r"}
{"text":"Had a really good experience at this place. The kaarage was so soft and tasteful. Could use a bit more sauceeee on it tho. The Japanese curry was probably one of the best I've had in Toronto. I think if they put the kaarage on top of the curry, would've been bomb"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in a span of three weeks (with two different friends on Nov 21 and Dec 08).  The first time I tried Onnki Donburi, it was for dinner and the waitress explained that their  weekly donburi changed every week, so I opted for the Gal-B one (Korean Kalbi).  It was super tasty, but probably a bit salty because I remember being pretty thirsty afterwards.  Overall, it was good and I didn't expect any less.  The second time I went was for lunch and I really wanted to try the Salmon Lovers bowl... but... they just sold out right when I was going to order.  I went with the Buta Fire bowl and, while it was good, I think they added too much seasoning because an hour or two afterwards, I was extremely thirsty (can't tell if it's because it was a bit salty or just the fact it was a spicy dish -- I did have about a cup and a half of water while eating).  The heat is just right -- it's one of those bowls where it slowly gets hotter with the more you eat.  Just some comments: - It's a bit more spacious inside than I thought but seating is still a bit limited (you either sit at the bar and watch them build your bowls or at the back with bar stools).  There's a coat rack near the bathroom for you to hang your jacket. - The first time I went, the waitresses would refill our cups with water.  The second time I went, I was informed that water was self-serve near the entrance.  Not sure what happened with that to make them change to self-serve, but it's no biggy."}
{"text":"Can here for dinner on a Friday night.  Was about 35% full and all seating was bar style.  Was interesting sitting in front of the kitchen and watching them cook.  I would recommend them to add some tables for groups of 4 or more as bar style  For food I shared a salmon and beef rib bowl with a friend.   The salmon bowl is pretty salmon sashimi, tempera bits, letttuce, ginger, wasabi on rice. After a few bites if it I got bored with flavours and would have preferred a poke bowl which has many more textures and flavours.  The beef rib bowl was better as it contained onions, lettuce, ginger, and egg on rice.  The beef was marinated well, tender and moist."}
{"text":"I don't know why every time we come to Onnki Donburi, it is Sunday. (It is closed on Sunday...).  Finally, we go there on Tuesday night this time. We ordered Buta Fire (pork belly with soy sauce) and Sake Lover (Salmon). Sake Lover is ok but the buta fire is awesome! Although the portion is small for male, the price is lower than other restaurants and it is the best Donburi in Toronto. I am sorry to move Goshi (Dundas West & Barthurst) to the 2nd because the tenderness and sweetness of Buta Fire at Onnki Donburi are just perfect! Hope this restaurant runs its business longer!"}
{"text":"Cute grab and go or sit down spot for delicious Japanese rice bowls (Donburi). Service was bright and friendly and we were able to sit close to the kitchen to watch the action go down. This restaurant has a very focused menu. The menu options include pork belly, salmon, eel and shrimp on rice. We grabbed the pork belly and eel. The pork belly was grilled and had a nice charred taste. It was coated with soy sauce and perfectly complimented the cabbage slaw and picked vegetables. The eel was grilled, still had a fishy taste though. Perhaps I just like the charred flavour profile too much.  The portion was generous. We also tried their spicy fried chicken. It's not very spicy, had more black pepper flavouring with a sweet note. Overall the food was good!"}
{"text":"The decor was very simple and traditional of a Japanese restaurant. I tried the unamatata dish (eel), which was quite different than other eel dishes I had at other Japanese restaurants. Nevertheless, it was delicious and filling. I also tried their karaabe (like popcorn chicken), which was very appetizing. I would recommend to go here once in awhile."}
{"text":"The hands down best donburi I've ever had in my entire life here in Toronto. No freaking joke. We ordered two Sake Lover salmon donburis and...just insert the profanities. So, that's how I feel about the food, but the attention to detail in the servingware is so appreciated. The bowls are minimal and lovely, the woodgrain chopsticks are natural and light. The space itself is narrow and meant for quick eating, but there's no pressure to leave from the servers. They were, in fact, attentive and gentle in making sure we were comfortable.   Even without all the other elements, the flavour, quality, and presentation of the food speaks for itself and holds it's own. Had Onnki had a crummy interior, served the food in sad disposable plates with cheap plastic cutlery, and had the sassiest waitresses...I'd still give the place a 5 star rating just for the donburi alone. Waah, please please visit!"}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem in Toronto core !  Excellent food and great friendly staff ! Highly recommended to anyone looking for authentic Japanese Donburi"}
{"text":"I just had this pork belly rice bowl for dinner. My order came and an appetizer size mostly rice bowl arrived. It was barely filling. The few chunks of meat tasted like home made stir fry with extra soy sauce, and my bill for all that is 13$.   The restaurant is really small, I feel like they had to hire a waitress just to rack up tips. For an empty place there were too many staff in the kitchen too.   TLDR avoid this wallet rip off"}
{"text":"Was super excited to visit after seeing 4 star reviews. However, I didn't have a good experience. Given the hype, we needed to wait a good 30 minutes to be seated. We then were told at ordering that there was no sake lover donburi. I was quite disappointed that they only said that upon ordering because honestly I only wanted that donburi. We ended up ordering katsu to start, the buta and the magic chasu donburis. The food came slow and the waitress forgot to put in our karrage order which we had to follow up on since we saw other people who came after us with their karrage. When it finally came, it was nicely presented but I found the breading to be too heavy. As for the donburi, the magic chasu was the better of the two. The buta is more flavourful but the magic chasu is more refined. Overall, the service, disorganization ruined my experience even though my donburi dish was delicious."}
{"text":"Saw this place on blogto cheap eats website. The sake bowl in the picture is around $15 after tax. The size is decent although I wouldn't consider it to be cheap eats. The salmon was really fresh and the service is super quick during weekday lunch. The place is very small but most people come for order pick up, so there's always seats. Will come back sometime during dinner to try eel on rice. Is only available during dinner."}
{"text":"they have really great good. Although the selection range was not big, every dish on the menu is really tasty! The services are great as well. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really good golbi with a generous portion of meat. I forgot about the semi cooked egg on golbi. Next time I would ask for it a little more done as I like the whites fully cooked. Also tried the chicken karage and it was quite good with the chicken tender and not too much batter. I would come back again when I'm next in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Quick and easy! Clean bathroom! Good karaage!! Trendy and fun. Def a good find in the city! Portion is larger than expected and it was def filling! Def would rec'd to others and come back if/when I visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"Used to come here at least once a week last year since they opened. Unfortunately the past couple of weeks have been very disappointing.   My coworkers and I used to love coming here because of their Buta Fire (pork belly on rice). It used to blow everyone away because the pork belly was sliced perfectly and was blow torched on the stove. It had the perfect charred exterior and the meat was always tender and juicy. Buta red fire and kaarage was also a popular choice!  However, onnki donburi lost my interest over the last couple of weeks when they started changing up the quality of the meat and how they prepared the dish. For a while, they switched it to meat cubes which didn't taste good because of the meat to \"charred\" ratio. I know a couple of folks were not impressed so we were all happy when they reverted it back to thick rectangular slices of meat. That happiness only lasted for a little. Before we knew it, onnki stopped blow torching the meat (so no more charred texture) and the meat is as tough as a rubber glove!   Unless they go back to the original meat and cooking quality, I doubt I'd ever return."}
{"text":"THE HYPE IS REAL.  I found Onnki Donburi through a recent BlogTO post and thought I better visit before all the yuppies (like myself) come through.  Onnki Donburi is very clean and elegant - all the seating is bar style with stools so it is more of a \"fast casual\" type of restaurant. A waiter will seat you and take your order, but you can also get take out at the counter.  The food is simple, yet so delicious. Reasonable prices and generous amounts!  Sake Lover: - Generous portion of salmon sashimi - Tempura bits on top adds a nice crunch - The rice has a vinegar dressing on it, which I really enjoyed when mixed in with the salmon   Galbi Don: - Also a generous portion of meat - Well-marinated and good flavour - It comes with a poached egg to be mixed in  Onnki Karaage - Not oily inside, yet still juicy - It is drizzled with mayo and topped with green onions - a slice of lemon would have been a good touch  I will definitely be back to try the other ones (the Ebi Triple and the Buta Red Fire) next time!"}
{"text":"Onnki Donburi is great if you just want a simple rice bowl with protein. Actually, their Spicy Pork and their Salmon Donburis are delicious but I can't justify the price for each bowl when I can get similar or better options at other locations. Still worth a visit but I wouldn't be returning"}
{"text":"My experience with Onki Donburi was pleasurable. Highly recommend Onki Karaage and pork donburi dish. Chicken donburi was also very delicious and was unique to the pork one."}
{"text":"I have really mixed feelings about this place. I have only been here once, admittedly - however, the wait times were absurdly slow. I thought this would be a quick and easy place to eat before a movie. Total opposite!   Our food took an hour to arrive. It wasn't a complicated order by any means, we were only a group of three and the restaurant was buzzing with little groups of people but not slammed. The server came by to apologize multiple times for how long it was taking - and even brought us salmon sashimi to make up for it (that was nice of her). The kitchen is visible (you literally sit bar style around the kitchen) - and nothing appeared to be wrong. Just slow cooks.   Despite being super hungry, frustrated and running late for our movie however - the food was delicious and I can't deny it. It was guilty pleasure, Japanese comfort food goodness.   I would say, if you are fine with having to spend a couple of hours in a restaurant that basically only serves rice bowls and should have these orders down to a science...then go for it, you certainly wouldn't be let down by the taste!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a little while and my group chanced upon it after bailing on waiting on seating for sushi and okonomiyaki. The place looks sleek, simple, and clean, with seating arranged single-sided along the kitchen and the wall. I spied an Anova immersion circulator, gas stove, Cuckoo pressure/induction rice cooker, grill station, and a plating/garnish/torching station tucked out of sight---all manned by a team running like a well-oiled machine. The menu was small, presumably composed of only well thought-out and refined creations. I went for the the ebi triple and it was delicious. Every bite was flavourful, with a crispy exterior and succulent core on the shrimp, and a balanced sauce to rice ratio and generous garnish (onions, scallions, pickled ginger, nori strips, mayo-based sauce drizzle). Served in Japanese-style patterned donburi bowls, the portions were deceptively large and filling. Pricepoint seems fair given the quality and portion size, as well as in comparison to uptown donburi counterparts (which I'll say now are decidedly inferior in quality but have a greater variety). I'll be back to try the sake bowl. Recommended"}
{"text":"Good good, good portion size, good service.  Not very spacious tho, and not so good for group settings  The food is a bit too oily. I ordered the pork don, and tried the shrimp. They're both oily but taste fine"}
{"text":"Quality has declined ... The first few times I had the Buta Fire, the pork slices were nicely grilled and charred. The recent few times, the port slices did not taste like they were grilled or charred at all. They almost taste like they were just poach cooked. And worse, the slices were mostly fat instead of meat. That does not taste anywhere as good as before! I hope they can change it back to the earlier taste and quality!"}
{"text":"Great dishes and very very tasty food. I wish there were a few more sides to choose from.  When I went I wanted to try the kalbi bowl but they had run out for that day so that was disappointing.   It's a bit pricy but really very tasty."}
{"text":"First time coming here after I saw good reviews online. We weren't disappointed! We both got Buta Fire $10.9 - grilled pork belly on rice! It was cool that the kitchen was open-concept so we could all watch them in action.  For the pork belly, they first grilled it, then pan fried it over high heat, then finished by torching. Each cook in the kitchen seemed very focused and organized - one does the pork belly, one does sashimi, one cooks rice and finishing touches.    Buta Fire was delicious! The pork belly was amazing. It was a generous portion of meat on top of a bed of nicely cooked japanese rice. I just wished it had some vegetables to balance as I'm not a big meat eater.   Since we sit at the bar, it would be great if the restaurant installed hangers underneath for lady's purses so we don't need to put it on the ground (it's great you have a coat rack at the back already).   We waited around 10 minutes to get our orders in, so you may need to expect that. The waitresses were very kind and busy, and I entertained myself by watching the kitchen staff, so it was okay.   Overall, we had a great time dining here. We'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fairly new place. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if I could, but since I can't, I am going to round up. Lots of other better places to eat, but a good local spot for when you are hungry and looking for some karaage or katsu with curry. Overall satisfied and will eat there again, but wouldn't travel across town for it."}
{"text":"Amazing food with great service. By having only Donburi on the menu it is specialized on this great Japanese food. The place is clean, organized and you eat looking at the kitchen working on full throttle. They have a menu for lunch and another on for dinner. I'll suggest the chicken Katsu and the buta fire. Both great options. Also check the karaage chicken. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"A little expensive for the quality and portion size. The taste is decent. Would recommend only if it's on your way and you just want something quick."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday with a friend and it wasn't too busy! Hidden away from the hustle and bustle of nearby Bloor and Yonge, the restaurant has a quiet ambience that compliments the simplicity of its menu. They specialize in Japanese rice bowls.  We started with the agedashi tofu to share. The texture of the tofu was deliciously crunchy and was topped with a house made ginger/vegetable spread and served in a bowl of a sauce. This dish is a little small so if you're hungry, I'd recommend getting one per person.  Both of us ordered the Buta Fire bowl, which came with pork shoulder, cabbage and a soy sauce to tie the dish together. The bowl seemed small but packs a lot of substance with a large layer of meat and vegetables over a hearty serving of rice. The saltiness of the pork melded well with the rice and definitely seemed to have a unique personality from the other rice bowls that they offered.  Had a great experience here and will definitely be back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Like an earlier review mentioned, it seems like something has changed. When I first started going here regularly, the portions were huge and the pork belly was cooked perfectly. The last 2 times I've ordered takeout, the pork has been way fattier, thicker, and not really rendered enough. Excluding those last 2 times, this place would be a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Get the galbi (Korean BBQ short ribs) don - for $12.9 they give a generous potion of meat to the point where we had more meat than rice leftover! It's definitely worth it for both lunch or dinner. It tasted amazing and only around for a limited time (hoping they make this a permanent addition tho!).    There are only 4 items on the menu, but what they offer is really good. My boyfriend and I got the galbi don (Korean BBQ short ribs) and sake don (salmon) and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. To my surprise too, they also gave lots of sashimi slices and offered me soy sauce on the side (I like things saltier but the rice is already marinated).  The lovely part is that their decor is very minimalistic and open concept so you can see the chef preparing the food with a lot of love and care. It's a great place to dine alone because all their seating are up against the wall or toward the kitchen like bar seating.  It's a little hidden down one street from Bloor but it's worth the trip. I'll definitely be back to try the other options! We hope they'll add more items in the future."}
{"text":"A nice spot tucked away. The different \"don\" are really tasty and priced nicely too. Only thing I'll say is that apps seem to cost (when considered telative to don) and the place can get overwhelmed quite easily."}
{"text":"Waiter recommended their salmon sashimi Donburi, did not disappoint! The rice was cooked perfectly, served warm. Salmon was super fresh, the added pickles was a perfect contrast to the salmon's texture and adds just enough acidity to cut through the fattiness. Overall a great Donburi experience."}
{"text":"A small little restaurant tucked away in a quiet street on Hayden street by Yonge. This place gets busy super fast so expect long lineups during peak hours. Note: they don't serve water during lunch time, it's a bit strange and they're very limited in seats so come early. They have an open kitchen and it's cool sitting at the counter to watch all the variety of meats getting grilled. Really sets the bar higher for your hunger meter, feel your mouth water!  There's very few meals on the menu, not a lot of variety but it's rice bowls so they have all the popular dishes people are normally used to. I just wished they had a mixture of meats combined, but I guess that would take away the authenticity of the dish.   I came here for dinner with the group, we ordered much of everything. Orders ranged from the galbi don, sake lover, ebi triple, katsu curry, and buta fire. I personally ordered the galbi don and it was delicious. The serving of meat was surprisingly decent; note, it doesn't say the meal comes with onions on the menu but it does get included in your meal so for all the onion haters out there like me, let your server know ahead of time. Anyway, the pickled radishes that came with the meal was really good and I wish they gave us some more of that.   The other bowls were complimented by my friends so I can only assume they were good.   There's a little table near the front that has water with cups, my friends were confused thinking water was self-serve but turns out the waiters will serve water during dinner. I think the self-serve is only during lunch.   Overall a neat little shop and I'll definitely drop by if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Tucked in a small street just a few minutes away from the busy yonge-bloor intersection, this place is attracting a lot of customers! Went on a Saturday and had to wait for 15 mins for 2 seats. Another 10-15 min wait for food after we ordered. The pork belly bowl was delicious. We ordered both the spicy and original, but the spicy version was just the original sauce with gochujang, which is not spicy at all. So dont spend the extra dollar for the spicy bowl! As delicious as it was though, I found the whole meal greasy. I guess thats what you get with pork belly :) It's an open concept kitchen so be prepared to smell like grilled meat!!  Tips: dont order the kaarage. Small and mediocre."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night. Long wait. Bar setting place. No coat hanger. Customer has to hold their coat which is bit ridiculous. Had curry chicken katsu Don. $9.99 + $3 for chicken. Small portion with such high price. Not worth to go second time. Just normal instant curry taste that you can buy at metro. Chicken katsu is just regular katsu that you can find in any korean resturant. Plus Quite smoky inside. Simple menu hope they can do better in the future."}
{"text":"They don't have much choices on their menu but it makes no difference for them to make the donburi superb and amazing. The shogayaki pork is very very delicious. It's a magic for ginger lover such as me! It seems like they change and replace items on the menu sometimes. Come regularly to check what they have changed for the menus."}
{"text":"A hidden gem located at a small street. The place is clean and tidy. Limited seating but very cozy. It's an open kitchen where you can watch the chef make your food while you wait. Everyone was really nice and attentive. Food was really good. We had a buta fire, karaage and sake lover. The poor belly in the buta fire was really good. The sauce was just perfect. Not too much not too little. The sale love was very fresh and both had lots of rice to fill your tummy. Karaage was crispy and piping hot. Would coke back again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the bowls here in this cute, nondescript spot tucked away on Hayden St. It's a no frills joint with an open kitchen and bar seating only. We came here on a Friday night and it was relatively busy but we were able to get seated right away.   The menu is simple: you get your choice of don with either pork belly, unagi, salmon or shrimp and then a few appetizers to choose from.   My friend and I both decided to get the Sake Lover since we were both craving salmon along with karaage as an appetizer. I expected the bowl to be on a bit on the bland side but it was very flavorful. The salmon sashimi was fresh and slightly warm from the vinegar rice underneath. It was topped with a bit of tempura and fish eggs for texture and pickles. Who would have thought of adding pickles to sashimi, but hey, it works! The karaage was delicious. Crispy on the outside and super moist on the inside.    Although the bowls look small, I was full after and my friend had trouble finishing hers. Would definitely come back! It's more on the pricy side but you can definitely tell that the quality is there."}
{"text":"Tonkatsu and salmon bowls are delicious. I have been here twice on work days during dinner hour, both times were busy but was seated immediately and food came in a reasonable time. It is a small place, bar style seating with people right next to each other. You can see the chefs cook behind the bar, which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Really excellent place, had the salmon don, and miso soup, both excellent. Will have to go back for the pork belly, and some of the other dishes. Very reasonable prices as well. Will be back for more."}
