{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Saturday evening for dinner. The service was terrible. It was our first visit, no one said a word to us when we walked in the door. We stood there for a few minutes, then decided we must be supposed to seat ourselves. We sat down at a booth and waited a good 5 minutes or so before we were even acknowledged.   The waitress was pretty rude, and didn't have much personality, even though my husband and I always try to be very nice and courteous. They were also not busy at all (she only had one other table). We both built our own burgers. My husband ordered a pretzel bun and I ordered the normal hamburger bun. When our food arrived the buns were switched, which the waitress acknowledged when she dropped it off. She didn't suggest a solution, just \"oh, they switched your buns\". So we had to swap our buns ourselves. We also both ordered our burgers medium rare, and they were both cooked well.  We both ordered onion straws (as listed on the menu) and received one greasy onion ring on the bottom of our burger. Gross.   Fries were good.   We will not be back and would not recommend this restaurant unless you were just going for a beer and to watch a game."}
{"text":"We just left Cleats.....we won't be back.  My husband ordered a burger done MEDIUM...it came out RARE.  Now, just so you know, I have worked in restaurants many times and I know the difference between Rare and Medium.   I ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich.  The meat on the sandwich we think may have been really ground up cube steak...?  Either way it was not the thin cut sandwich steak that is usually on a Philly.   We had onion rings and fries.  It is pretty hard to mess up fries, so they were okay.  The onion rings had a weird after taste and were greasy between the breading and onion....eeh So all in all Yelpers....Stay away!  Maybe..it would b okay just for a beer and nachos...?  But if you want food - head on down the road. Thankfully I had a Groupon so I don't feel so bad about using my money here."}
{"text":"We went here on the advice of friends after our first choice of restaurants ended up being closed.  I was a little put off by the appearance at first -- kinda looked like a dive from the outside, but it was a real treat.  Servers were prompt in greeting us and getting drinks.  She was very patient when I couldn't decide what I wanted -- the menu is full of great choices of pub food, including multple types of tacos, sandwiches, etc.  Food was delivered to our table quickly.  I ordered steak tacos, which were light and yummy.  I am, however, a real wimp with spicy food, and found that although they didn't taste spicy going down, there was a real kick afterward and my stomach was on fire for a while afterward.  That being said, I REALLY can't handle spicy food, so it was probably just something I shouldn't have ordered.  The onion rings were really good as well, and the tuna sandwich looked wonderful.  I ordered a margarita, which tasted great, except that they used regular salt instead of sea salt, so that was a little off.  Great atmosphere, nice music and the staff were really friendly.  Don't miss this hidden gem.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Mostly this is your typical sports bar place with bar food.  The wings are awesome and the drinks are fairly priced.  My friends and I are in love with the one waitress here who treats us like one of her best friends.  We make sure to check in here at least twice a month if not for the great wings, to check in with our favorite waitress, Geneka."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, its a new menu.  The service still sucks, but now the food does too.  We ordered wings and they were full of sauce but very bland.  The onion rings were good, but we only got 7, three large rings and four small ones.  The waitress gave us a small container of a different sauce to pour over the wings cause we didn't eat the wings they were so bad.  It was bad, and now everyone in my party sad they don't want to come here anymore."}
{"text":"This bar has the best garlic parmesan wings I've had in the area.  The staff is nice and the food is generous and I always go there for their wings.  The place is sometimes quite silent which makes it a little awkward to eat when it's only you and maybe 2 other tables but I've gotten used to it.  The parking tight but manageable.  Their food is priced very well and I only have 2 issues with this place.   Although small which I don't mind, but don't advertise it is their sauce for their wings.  On the menu it says X amount of wings comes with X amount of sauce.  So when I order X amount of wings I'm expecting X amount of sauce, but they charge you for it.  It's only like 25-30 cents but at least let it state clearly that it's extra instead of saying it comes with the wings.  Secondly I've ordered one of their house special drinks which is called something like the \"lake erie monster\" or \"great lakes monster\" which is green.  I expected great things from this drink but unfortunately was a bit disappointed.  But for a good dim lit time this place is somewhere worth checking out!  TRY THE WINGS!"}
{"text":"Strange odor coming from bathroom . Other than that and the food was cold , not a bad place"}
{"text":"Such a great place to chill out at. Food is good and drinks are always cold. I am never alone when here"}
{"text":"I've been going to the cleats restaurants for over a decade. I love the good and have probably tried every item on the menu. When a new item, flavor or style is added or changed I typically try them. It's safe to say that we order the \"beer cheese pretzels\" every visit. Today we ordered them for the table as usual and they appeared twice as dark colored as normal. They were not far off from blackish/brown. I told our waitress and she insisted that they weren't burnt but \"we changed our bread\"! They were clearly burnt! I told her that they taste burnt as well and she told me that they weren't and walked away! - I would have been happy if she would of simply brought a new order or simply apologized!"}
{"text":"Holed up in a conference room in Cleveland for the past month (don't you wish you had my job?) I'm now a self-declared expert on all places within 30 miles that will deliver food to our downtown office.   That said, I now officially refuse to eat food that arrives from Cleats Club.   As this was delivery, I cannot comment on locale or decor, but the food is dismal. We don't have a wealth of choices when it comes to delivery food, so we've had Cleats three times.   The first time, I had a salad. Approximately 80% of said salad was the white spiny-part of iceberg lettuce that I generally chuck in the trash. Bleh. Even the diced tomatoes looked embarrassed to be resting upon a bed of such unappetizing lettuce.   Second time around... I had another salad (I'm trying to be healthy, yo!) and I suppose Cleats helped that goal as I threw it away, again.   Third strike: Buffalo chicken strips. OK, I ditched the diet and went with something I though most \"bar & grille\" places could do with ease. False. Five strips of breaded chicken with buffalo sauce splashed randomly across the top. The \"grilled vegetables\" on the side were primarily broccoli stems. Why are you constantly trying to feed me refuse, Cleats??   After the aforementioned buffalo chicken affront, I went back into our conference room and wrote on the white-erase board (in big letters) \"NO MORE FOOD FROM CLEATS OR I WILL GO ON A HUNGER STRIKE!\"   Hunger. Strike.  Just like Gandhi."}
{"text":"Nice little bar close to where I used to work.   Only went a couple of times but the drink prices were reasonable, the selection of beers was surprisingly good and the menu items I've tried were prepared competently if not artistically.  I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Food is usually good and the bartenders are super nice. Big complaint today though... a guy was sitting at the bar cussing out some customer using really foul language. I mean it was getting very awkward and in these days who knows what people will do. So a bit scary... Yes, it's a bar. That's besides the point. I couldn't understand why the MANAGER didn't say a word to this guy. She was standing right there!!  Come to find out he's an employee! Acting a fool and walking in and out of the kitchen with his beer.  Sorry that's just not cool. I've worked in restaurants. Allowing your employee to cuss out some dude at the bar is trash.  Way to keep it classy Cleats. Done."}
{"text":"wings were pretty good. Salads could use improvement. Would go again for carry out. Booths uncomfortable"}
{"text":"Jerk pulled pork tacos were good, so was the jalapeno cheese stuffed pretzel app. Great place to watch a game with adequate beer selection. Bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for late night food. Cleanest bar/restaurant I've been to. The bathroom was super clean. Tons of seating. Our waitress was really nice.  Food was really good.  I got the black and blue burger. I was skeptical of coming here. The outside of the restaurant is not appealing but its worth it."}
{"text":"Great service. Very friendly. Food is great every time I come here. Chill place. I loveee the potato skins and the wings and the mozzarella planks! Best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Looks like I got food that was made yesterday :/  Cheese looks old and stale  Ingredients all tasted stale and like warmed up in a microwave"}
{"text":"My husband and son love the wings.  We also often get their salads, burgers and chicken sandwiches.  Everything is very good...and the fries are okay.  They used to make their own...but  whatever they are now using have very little taste.  Ambiance is cool..either a game on the TV or sometimes too loud rock and roll."}
{"text":"** Review update: I was contacted by management with an apology and offer to make it right by coming in for another meal. I appreciated the gesture and have updated my stars accordingly. **  Just moved to the area, and decided to give Cleats a try for dinner via UberEATS. I was hoping for some decent bar food, but what a mistake. I ordered a burger cooked medium well, and it instead came so rare I'm not convinced it touched a grill or pan at all before being served up. Entirely pink through and through, I couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"I order delivery very often. The spicy garlic parmesan wings are amazing! Burgers are fantastic. I switch between the buffalo chicken quesadilla and the spicy chicken tacos. Always on point. This is my number one go to for delivery!!!"}
{"text":"One the best go to sports bars in Cleveland, period! Been going to this Cleats for the last 12 years, for lunch & dinner. Food, service and overall experience is always top notch!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and super close to Tremont.  Real low key.  Decent food and beer specials.  Dont ask for wings well done..they wont do it..no matter how many times ya have to send em back..."}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago for fish fry. It was overcooked and beer was warm. Mentioned warm beer to waitress. No offer for another beer. Will not go back again."}
{"text":"We used an UberEATS coupon and ordered from this joint one night and wow we were surprised. We picked it because it was close by and the food looked inexpensive.  I ordered wings which were super crunchy breaded wings with great flavor. My boyfriend ordered the melt and it was all so freaking good and not bad in price either. The food was hot when it got here and we were super happy with the service as a whole.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is a family friendly place with about 40 seats at the bar. Although it was too cool to sit outside, I can't wait to come back to enjoy the patio. There are about 10 tables for 4 on the brick patio with beautiful hanging flowers. The service was outstanding, the food hot and the place clean. Lots of TV's to watch the Cavs playoff games."}
{"text":"I like all of the Cleats restaurants! Great salads and especially great chicken!  The sandwiches are great too, I've been a customer for over 15 years!"}
{"text":"Came to catch the end of the cavs game and we ended up ordering food. We got the beer cheese sliders, kalua tacos, and jalapeño pretzel. The sliders were great. Kalua tacos pulled pork was dry but very well seasoned, had a little kick to it. The pretzel was my favorite it had jalapeño cheese on the inside and came with nacho cheese for dipping. Don't forget to check in, free app with 2 entree purchase. I recommend the jalapeño pretzel!!!"}
{"text":"I don't go to Cleats expecting a quiet atmosphere, low key/sober clientele, or even the best food in town. I go for the wings, the potato skins, and even sometimes for the basketball. But, my list trip to Cleats will really be my LAST.   My friend and I went in, sat down- it was a reasonably steady Wednesday night. But, nothing too crazy, so we ordered. Few waters and looked at our menus. 20 minutes later, our waters came. Our server apologized for the delay and took our order. The server than came back and indicated what I ordered wasnt available, they didn't offer shrimp on their salad. I showed her where in the menu I selected the item from- and she indicated she would \"try\" to have it made. We ordered 2 salads, 6 wings, and potato skins. 40 minutes later, our food arrived. In total we had already been at the resteraunt an hour, and had only received water. When our waitress came she expressed her thankfulness that we were \"patient\". After receiving our food (some of which was hardened and cool at this point) we were never checked on, our server returned to the table 25 minutes later with the bill, which didn't include any acknowledgement of our excessive wait.   Ive been a server for years. There are so many ways to handle high volume, long waits, and customer satisfaction. Clearts didn't utilize a single one."}
{"text":"I've been there 3-4 times to watch the cavs playoff games since my last review.  The service was fine except on one occasion, on a very slow Friday night, my friends and I watched as our bucket of beers [$8 for 4 domestics] sat at the bar, unattended for 5 minutes, when our server [a guy, no glasses] finally returned with them. They now have summer shanty on tap."}
{"text":"The other night I placed an order for pickup around 11 pm. One of the things that I ordered was a turkey reuben, which i've gotten numerous times before and enjoyed. When they repeated my order back to me when I was placing it, they said turkey reuben, so I know that they definitely heard me correctly. Once I got back home, I realized that they made the wrong thing (a turkey club). I know they realized that they made the mistake, because they threw in a container of sauerkraut (although the turkey reuben doesn't even have sauerkraut on it, it's cole slaw instead). So instead of fixing the mistake, they just made a half assed attempt to \"fix\" it, and they didn't even do that correctly. I understand that mistakes happen, but the thing that I find inexcusable is that they clearly knew that they messed up but didn't care. Another mistake they made is that they didn't include any condiments. If they have given me thousand island, I could've just made it work even though it wouldn't quite have been what i ordered, buuut they didn't. Not any ketchup or mayo, either. I couldn't even call to complain or to get the order fixed because they closed soon after I picked up my order. Definitely will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"You come to Cleats for wings, and they're criminally underrated wings at that. You come to Cleats on Tuesday/Wednesday, because you can get said wings for 49 cents, whether they're boneless, bone-in, or even not wings at all (shrimp). Or you come to Cleats to be unimpressed by the other menu options that always seem to fall a bit short. But that's not what my review is about. My review is about Cleats signature item, the wings.  I've been a big fan of Cleats wings ever since taking my first bite of them at the former Hooters location in Mentor on 306. And it was that day I was introduced to things I can only talk about in a wing restaurant... dry rubs. The best of the dry rub bunch come in the forms of their signature flavors, the Six Pepper Blend and the Erie Island Smoke. The spicy and sauce-free flavors pop in your mouth, and can be washed down with one of the cheap daily domestics to enhance the flavor. Some other non-dry rub favorites include the house BBQ (Memphis Belle) and the Buffalo Ranch. If you're feeling adventurous, jump aboard the Sweet Heat, and have a pint on the ready.  Cleats is not trying to be flashy. It's trying to be a break from the hipster lifestyle up the street. It delivers on that, and is my go-to spot on Tuesday/Wednesday night. It should be yours, too."}
{"text":"I go here just for wings at lunch. The wings are always incredible. Shi* one day I had to double back with friends that's how good they were. That's also when I tried \"The Lake Erie Monster\" it tastes just like a popcicle on a hot summer's day!! The place is a wing diamond in the rough.. All of the bartenders are nice... Howeverrrr the manager is not very welcoming.. in fact she's quite unpleasant..she serviced us rude, sharp, and short with an awkward disposition that made us feel uncomfortable.. if you'd ever been you'd know just what I mean. I would def recommend this place because the food is fresh and awesome and the bartenders are great!"}
{"text":"This is right down the road from work, so it's a great choice for a beer and wings for my fellow steel workers.   The wings are great and probably the only thing you should really be ordering from the menu. The sandwiches are fine and the appetizers are good."}
{"text":"A good place to go when you just want a sports bar and some bar grub close to Tremont.  They have daily food and beer specials, and actually a pretty great menu for bar food.  I'm always happy with my meals here, even though I get wings most of the time.    The service has always been good, even as an annoying party of 8 for the superbowl.  There were a couple issues with the drafts lacking any carbonation, but it was solved effortlessly.    I like this hidden little sports bar."}
{"text":"This place is still good. When i was in my 20s this was the pregame spot. Now its a nice bar/grill to hang out with a couple friends and catch the games and grab a bite to eat. They are always running specials on drafts just depends on when you go. A friend and myself stopped in the other day when the cavs game was on...they had the cavs and indians games playing on the tvs.. Great to be able to catch both. The staff at this location is very friendly laid back and remembers all there customers. I do have to say the food that i get from there is great. I went on a wednesday and got the $0.55 wings and the loaded tots... True game food. It was awesome. You definatly have to check out the Kentucky bourbon sauce. SPOT ON WINNER, I think better than any of the bw3 sauces.. thanks gor the great service and good food. Ill be back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have been to other Cleats restaurants and had great experiences. This was hands down one of the worst bars I have ever had the misfortune of entering.  Walking in my boyfriend and I are not even greeted. I would understand if they were busy but the place was dead. So we decide to sit in a booth and a waitress finally notices us. We ordered drinks, salad, and 24 wings (extra crispy).  I ordered a Lake Erie Monster, which was average only if you like super sugary kool aid like drinks. Don't blame that on them because the menu states whats in in and I still picked it.    So we get our food; salad and wings come out and the same time. Salads not dressed so we save that for last so our wings don't get soggy in the sauce. We ordered two dry rubs and two sauces. The dry rub is perfectly coated. The sauce on the other hand? Glopped on. So we start with the dry rubs obvs!  I had the five pepper with was soooo salty I think it should be 5 salts! He had the cajun which was good. After getting through about half of the first wing we notice it is still really pink inside!! The outside was crispy so we figured maybe to cook raised the temperature to get them crispy faster. We open a few more wings just to check and sure enough they are all pink.  After waiting about 5 mins for our server to check on us we tell her about them so she brings over the manager. The manager apologizes but then starts making excuses and tries to convince us that they are ok to eat. Um no honey, I'm not eating pink chicken. She tells us that they bake the chicken first and then fry them so theres NO WAY that they aren't cooked thoroughly. Upon asking her why they are so pink then she says that theres no way to cook the wings to get all the pink out without over-scorching them. WHAT?!?! So all the other twice cooked wings that I've had in my lifetime were a figment of my imagination I guess. Theres no way we are eating bloody wings so she takes them away and doesn't even offer to recook them.  She asks us if we would like to get something else and we say sure. While looking through the menu we decide to start on our chicken cobb salad. We decided to stop looking at the menu because the salad was so gross. How do you even mess up a salad. I was picking at it going around the chicken because it was so gross tasting which is unlike me because I am a huge carnivore!   So we ended up getting our check and getting the hell out of there. I wouldn't recommend this place...ever."}
{"text":"A good place to go when you just want to chill and grab a drink.   Didn't eat anything.  Bartender was super nice.  Prices were good.  Great after work or after a game spot."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and there wasn't much of a crowd. But it's also a holiday weekend. We got the nachos with grilled chicken which were pretty good. They had a corn salsa on them which was nice surprise. I got Garlic Parmesan wings and my sister got the chicken club sandwich. I originally went here because my credit card had a promotion on it for this restaurant and I'll go back again."}
{"text":"The food, drinks. bartenders and servers are awesome. Too bad the management is mean, inept, rude and over reaching. Ruined the entire experience. There is no reason to visit this establishment."}
