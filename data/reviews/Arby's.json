{"text":"HORRIBLE!

We got a late night dinner there and everything was horrible. First, it looked like it was closed. I am sure that the employees do this so people just drive away (I wish we did). Our order was wrong. Cold and super greasy fries. 

and the chicken sandwich was RAW! If you think it's a pain to cook chicken late at night because it takes awhile SAY YOU ARE ALL OUT! But never rush it.

This place needs to either be under new management or torn down. Start over with a place that gives a damn."}
{"text":"This location is awesome. Juan & Lily work hard to provide an enjoyable visit and go the extra mile. The Chicken Salad wrap is the very best  :-)  :-) but then again it is all so good."}
{"text":"I waited for my order for over 10 minutes. I ordered two chicken finger kids meals and two adult meals. Had to pull forward and wait another ten minutes for food. When I got home they didn't give me my kids meals."}
{"text":"Extremely rude especially miles and the girl who worked the window and shut it in my face when I asked for arby sauce. I proceed to call and ask for corporates number and she said to look it up online and hung up the phone. Corporate was notified and I advised for action to be taken and they need to review everyone elses experience noted about the same people I had to encounter.I ended up going to McDonald's due to unsure of how my food was prepped"}
{"text":"As usual they slop a whole bunch of secret sauce so you can't taste the beef or the rest of the sandwich.  I had the new advertised Rueben and sure wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Not sure what management is doing but it seems like this location is always understaffed and they are super slow with orders."}
{"text":"I love this Arby's now!  They changed the Interior to hip but didn't change their great food!  I always loved this Arby's because they made great Roast Beef Sandwiches and great Curley Fries, but now it has an updated atmosphere.  Everything is modern, but comfy.  For those of you that liked the TVs, they are gone, but everything else is great!  5 stars!  A Winner!  Best Arby's around!"}
{"text":"Great service. Gave me a Pepsi while I waited. Chicken sandwiches were nice and fresh. I'd rather wait than get what's been under a hot light."}
{"text":"Waited in line for twenty minuets while the lady's behind the counter talked and giggled. I was the only in line and I wasn't even given the courtesy of eye contact. I took my money and left and won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is always consistently good.  Customer services is so-so but who cares im not dating them lol."}
{"text":"Gotta love the Horsey sauce and curly fries.  I get a craving for the roast beef sandwiches every once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"One of the better places to eat in the Eaton Centre (extra star is awarded for being an Arby's).  But, alas, that's where my compliments end.  The food itself is pretty standard, and really not worth a second trip.  The Arby's in New York and in the Southern US are much better, but the quality does vary depending on the location."}
{"text":"Love Arby's. However a medium curly fries is allegedly 600(!) calories. So worth it though. 1 star off for their shakes being mediocre. They always seem to be pretty thin."}
{"text":"Some Arby's don't have regular fries anymore, this one does. Like the other Arby's I reviewed, 1 star off for having thin shakes. Also, check your order here, as they've forgotten an item a couple times."}
{"text":"Amon the crappiest of all Arby's, stale bread, poorly made sandwiches and unfriendly service."}
{"text":"Well, I tried the Brown Sugar BLT because I like bacon and brown sugar and the picture looked really good. It was not good, at all.  It looked nothing like the picture, the bacon was totally crispy and crumbled all over the table, there was a thick layer of brown sugar coating the bacon which was so sweet it was like eating spoon fulls of brown sugar right out of the box.  You have to try it to believe it, but i wouldn't waste the money.  Now, their smokehouse sandwitches are good.  So are their club sandwitches."}
{"text":"Waited at the counter for 10 minutes before someone took our order. There are 4 employees here and they are moving slower than snails. 75% off the tables are filthy. No straws in the lobby. Had to wait 3 minutes before someone grabbed someone, but of course they had to fill drive thru first. How hard is it to hand me 4 straws before you refill the empty container(s)?!? Usually this place is awesome. Right now it feels like a retirement center."}
{"text":"Horrible just horrible! Service is shit. Girls that work here are super unprofessional shouting at each other in front of guest. Took a good 30 minutes to get our food"}
{"text":"I just went to Arbys and tried 3 different sandwhiches.  The mushroom swiss roastbeef was amazingly awesome, but the roastbeef chedder was disappointing.  The cheese was runny and a real let down."}
{"text":"Haters gonna hate! No crying in fast food be specific if y'all got a problem!!! No mad about your orders but didn't do anything about it"}
{"text":"I understand that you can't cook good after a certian time of night but cold hard food??? Really? I spent 13 dollars of my hard earned money & I didn't expect to get cold food! This is not a good first experience & I WILL NEVER eat at this establishment again!"}
{"text":"Man! How is this place so consistently bad? Is there a manager working during any shift? I ordered 4 roast beef and cheddar meals through the drive thru and received 4 with no cheddar. I wasn't told ahead of time that they were out of the correct bun and the staff is so slow it's as if they don't want to sell food. The fries were reheated so they became spongy and no surprise, they just put cheddar on the original sandwich so it was cold when I got home. Do yourself a favor and avoid this location. Due to the numerous times I've dealt with similar issues it was time to complain unfortunately."}
{"text":"I wish I cold give no stars but I had a horrible experience do not recommend going to this Arby's ever, the service and food quality is become nasty!!! I was greeted by a girl with a mouth full of food chewing away and the oil dripping from her lips and she was doing everything she could do to turn me away because she wanted to get back to her conversation she was having with her girlfriend about what party to goto tonight."}
{"text":"I actually used to work here & it was my first job. It taught me a lot about customer service and I feel that it is particle why I am so great at my bar tending job now. However, I came into the drive-thru not to long ago and although I came 6 min before close, they told me they won't make food & when I told them the time, they turned off the head set. 1 star rating."}
{"text":"Horrible. Went thru the drive thru at lunch, ordered a \"roasted turkey\" salad for$4.99. 

What I got was a half of a bowl of salad with shredded turkey lunch meat on the top. Most of the lettuce was dirty/rotted/past its due date. Don't waste your money here folks."}
{"text":"The people who work here are awesome. The manager makes sure everyone gets what they ordered and how they want it.  For a fast food restaurant, they go above and beyond for customer service."}
{"text":"I will never be back to this Arby's. I've been there twice over the last 3 months.  Both times the associates walked back and forth several times before acknowledging me at the counter.  I had a simple order.  The kitchen staff had all walked out of the kitchen and the girl at the counter had to call someone back in to make my sandwich.  They were all back there when I placed my order.  I was given old mozzarella sticks and a cold Ruben that had no sauce and no sauerkraut.  All the meat was on one side of the bread."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this particular Arby's they mess my order up. I'm always missing a fries, sandwich, or my soda is not the one I ordered. Last time I went they didn't not give me my sandwich and I didn't notice until I had gotten home and everyone else had their dinner but me. So I called and the manager told me \" next time you come tell them your name and you'll get your sandwich.\" Ok. So I show up there and order my sandwich, tell them the story, and they kept trying to make me pay, saying I needed a coupon? But I never got a coupon. Then they tried to say if you want your free sandwich you need to buy one first... No I already paid for my sandwich and never got it. After a battle the manager rolled her eyes at me and said \"whatever just give her the sandwich\" I like Arby's but I have never been treated so rude after THEY messed up my order! I'm never going to that location again. 

I also wish I would have just gotten my money back because the sandwich was poorly made and was falling apart."}
{"text":"Really great service! Very nice employees! Great fresh delishous food! I had the french dip. Yummy!!! I would recommend this Arbys location to anyone."}
{"text":"Hey arbys explain this to me.... 
I went through the drive thru... mistake.  When I ordered 6 meals and request a big handful of arby sauce (love that stuff) I get 4.  What's the difference with 4 and a big handful? A lot!  We use it on our sandwiches and fries. I use more than 4 myself. I ask for more and they give me about 4 more. He gave me this irritated look like I was bothering him. IT'S YOUR JOB! If you hate it, leave it.  He informs me that I can only get 3 per sandwich (3 x 6 =18 right?). 
If I want more, he'll have to charge me. I just spent over $40 at ARBYS!
   The last time we ate there, we had to search for a table that didn't have garbage on it.  I went to the register to ask for a rag so I could wipe off the table, the girl gave me the rag... that was a hint. All the tables are dirty. Someone who \"works\" there should clean them.
  Anyway.... if I order the same meal inside, I can get as much sauce as I want from the pumper.  Why charge me for sauce when I'm messing up my own table?
   Terrible service.  Terrible eating conditions. Terrible policy on sauce...
-SAUCE NAZIS-"}
{"text":"They put at least 1/2 a cup of mayonnaise on a turkey club, possibly to mask the dryness of the very stale and crumbling bun. The sliced tomatoes were way past their sell by date, and the club had only enough turkey for half a sandwich. The jalapeno bites were good,  but would have been much better If they were hot, they were barely warm. The drink was all ice. That's what you get when you order their 2 dinners for $10 special - really bad food. If you go inside, you will be treated to the rudest employees you'll ever encounter, anywhere. They said I should have ordered it without mayonnaise. I said you're right. And I also should have ordered it a week ago, when the bun was fresh. I would never recommend this restaurant, and I will never take my family there again."}
{"text":"This has got to be the nices Arby's I've ever been in. Most of them are spaced strangely like the one close to Baseline and 7th St. in Phoenix.

The service was great. Food made fresh and they call out to you with a smile on their face. They say goodbye! when you're leaving. Food itself was your typical Arby's. I gotta figure out where I can buy my own Arby's Sauce though."}
{"text":"One of the best Arbys i visit.Staff is very friendly and quick with getting food out."}
{"text":"I don't know about the other locations but this one needs to get their sh*t together. Last night i waited over 15 minutes to get one fish sandwich that i ordered. They did offer me a free milkshake while i waited, which i took & drank right there but it was all foamy & almost completely melted. Not enjoyable. Most of the staff looked like it was their first day on the job. What a clusterfu*k of confusion. Absolutely pathetic it was. I will still go to this store, just for the convenience of close proximity to my workplace but seriously Arby's - you need to start hiring  better quality people."}
{"text":"This is a great Arby's. We went 30 min before closing and we're greeted in the drive thru by a very upbeat and pleasant woman. She took our order very accurately. Similar customer service to Chick-fil-A which is rare in the Tempe area for fast food!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service and food!  Never will eat there again.  Tell everyone to avoid couldn't be any cheaper there sandwiches and side orders are 60% bun (bread) I think there's going out of business.  Sucks!  Avoid. Total rip off!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today and decidedly to try the gyro, which is one of my favorite sandwiches. This  sandwich tasted ok, but it is not a gyro. It isn't gyro meat with the correct Greek seasoning, but rather their regular roast beef meat. Again, I like their roast beef, but it was way out of place on a gyro. Also, for a dollar more I can a gyro at Greek Pita with three times of actual meat.

3 stars because the sandwich tasted good, a little skimpy on the meat. Also, 3 stars because a gyro must have gyro meat, not regular roast beef."}
{"text":"I go here every week and this is a good Arby's--clean, very friendly people, fast service, and staff that go that extra mile (offering to bring your food to your table, to clear your tray, etc). My only complaint: the teeny-bopper radio selection. The food is standard Arby's fare, good. A good value for the money."}
{"text":"We don't have an Arby's near us and it has been years since I've had their roast beef and horsey sauce. But we were in the area and we decided to stop in.   It is as good as I remember.   My son had the Reel big filet fish sandwich which he absolutely loved.  It had a lot of tartar sauce but it really was very good. The curly fries were just ok but I was happy to have something else to dip in the horsey sauce which I couldn't get enough of.   I was debating between 4 and 5 stars but my son pushed me over the edge to the 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I don't not recommended this restaurant due to I gave the lady at the speaker my order three times and then again at the window.  When got the food back to my grandmother not only did they give us the wrong sandwich but instead of tea they gave us coke.  Then when I tried to call about the mistakes with the order I could not get them to answer I have never had a problem with Arby's but after this experience it will make me rethink going back to another Arby's ever.  Please do not go here."}
{"text":"Usually good, but the last 2 times, 1-2 star max. Both times, they forgot the sauces for side items and this time completely forgot the fork and salad dressing for the salad, despite having clarified 2x what kind I wanted. Kind of annoying to drive home and find that, as you pass item out, things you paid for are missing.   Gyro pita was mushy and salad had maaayyybe 2 slices of tomato and all else was all lettuce. 

Off of Arby's for a while"}
{"text":"They always get something wrong.  In my most recent event, I handed them a coupon when making my purchase and didn't think to check it until I got home (I went thru the drive thru) and they charged me regular price"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times now and it has been great! I always go through the drive thru. Food has always been hot, wait times aren't bad, and they always put the sauces I ask for in the bag! Service has been super friendly as well! Will continue to come here for sure."}
{"text":"The sliders in place of the junior roast beef sandwich is a horrible idea.  The bread is to thick and the swiss cheese is overpowering. The sandwich is supposed to be about sesame seeds, roast beef and arbys sauce!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and a clean restaurant. Best Arby's I've been to in the cleveland area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while in town scouting the area. Clean restaurant and awesomely friendly staff."}
{"text":"Overall I love a good Arby's roast beef sandwich but sadly the customer service or cleanliness suffers.  I pull in at a little after 8pm on a Friday night.  When I pull up there are three employees out on smoke break at the first for seater table outside and to the right of the entrance.  I had to get out my car and walk past them getting quite the huff of cigarette smoke.  Yuck!  I'm shocked the main store manager allows this to happen!  Normally smoking areas for employees are out of sight and far from the front entrance.  I walk in and use the bathroom first.  It was dirty but not so bad I wouldn't use the restroom.  Three employees are inside handling orders while the other three were on break.  They were just keeping up.  The dining room floor is filthy!  Dirt and black spots are everywhere!  About a third of the dining room tables were dirty where you could tell someone sat there and ate their meal.  I don't know when the dining room was last cleaned, and when the employees on break came back, no one made it a priority to clean the dining room.  I saw a lot of standing around talking (some business,  some pleasure) and one person in the kitchen area cleaning.  Sadly,  you can't really see into the kitchen to tell if it's reasonably clean.  The food was good; especially considering the time of day.  The ambiance was not great.  Not inviting to eat there with the dirty dining room and the loud music that was playing.  The music is just a local radio station and when commercials come on it's super loud and annoying. The young girl on the register was extremely polite  (thanks Employee 15; I couldn't read her name tag). I'm also super impressed,  when she had to sneeze,  she covered her nose/mouth with her elbow!  Hurrah for proper form!  Just wished she also covered her mouth, when she coughed,  using her elbow too.  Being hygienic is important when you are the one customers see representing your store."}
{"text":"if could I wouldn't give any stars! drive thru takes too long to get an order I've watched 4 to 5 people inside that have gotten their orders before I did...wasting fuel while waiting...situation is unacceptable especially paying 10 dollars for a meal..."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Arbys I've been to. Friendlies staff and a very good Manager that keeps it going. They seem to really take pride in their place."}
{"text":"I visited this location today and was more than disappointed. I used the drive-thru, which took quite some time. I ordered a beef and cheddar sandwich meal. When I got home I took two bites and then I saw mold on the bottom of my sandwich. Unfortunately I didn't have time to return the tainted bun, but I did get to snap some pics and will be sending it to their corporate office. It's completely unsanitary and is also a health hazard. I strongly advise to avoid this location, or at least inspect your food prior to consumption."}
{"text":"I decided to stop here after having a taste for Mexican food. Arby's was across the street. So I decided to give my service to this establishment instead. I haven't had Arby's in a lite bit. 
After placing my order of their \"New\" Bacon Swiss  Chicken sandwich. He said it would be a 5min wait. I sad nah. I'll just take the brisket sandwich. I pull up and wait 10mins. Behind the car in front of me. Once I pulled up to the window and paid for my food. I then waited another 7mins for my food to be brought to me. I just wasn't happy with the service I received here. Yet I'm an Arby's fan. I'll just be hesitant to ever visit this one again even though it's closes in proximity."}
{"text":"I have gone to other Arby's and they were so busy and so rude to everyone. This Arby's was busy and they were so nice to each and every customer and was so nice to be treated like an equal human being instead of an animal. I would totally recommend it."}

{"text":"I came to Arby`s via the drive thru on my way to work yesterday. The young lady working the drive thru was so pleasant that she actually made my day. This young lady is a fine example of GREAT customer service. She should be commended. I truly hope her manager knows what a gem she is. Oh...the food was good too!!!"}
{"text":"Alright so I'm not a huge fan of Arby's. I mean, I'll eat it if it's put in front of me, but generally I find everything to be a little gooey. Weird. 

BUT, I gave this particular Arby's four stars for the radicalist (as in the most radical, not like a radicalist who overthrows governments and stuff) sign ever to grace the Arcadia hood. It's right up there with the great Courtesy Chevrolet sign on Camelback.

Also: they have a bell you can ring for good service! I think every Arby's has it, but I love it because people will only ring it literally AS they are running out the door."}
{"text":"Awesome fish sandwiches!...good friendly service, recommended.  Clean place, including restrooms."}
{"text":"At 9:50 AM I walked in, and ordered a chicken biscuit. The girl at the register walked around for a second, came back and said \"we're out.\" So I asked what time they stop serving breakfast and she said 10:30 AM. She then said that the girl who's cooking would \"have to make it.\" So I asked if that was going to happen. She walks over to three people standing around in the kitchen, asks the cook if she'll be making any more, and the cook looks up at me, makes a rude face and says no. The woman cook then proceeded to go back to talking to the other cooks while leaning on the oven. At that point I would've just taken a plain biscuit! It's disgusting that there are people who have jobs and then go to work and stand around and get paid to do nothing. I mean, how do you tell a customer 45 minutes before breakfast ends that you're \"just not going to make any more biscuits.\" A complete lack of work ethic, it's disgusting. I looked at the girl and said, so you're just not going to make any then? Laughed, and walked out. My advice? Hire someone who would be grateful to have a job and who would take pride in it. Those people do exist. You don't have to have people in the kitchen who act like that."}
{"text":"Skimpy on the beef, and they add requirements to coupons. Do NOT go there if you want free cookie with ANY full-price purchase, like coupon says; the young shift leader directs staff to require SANDWICH purchase at full price. MA'AM, PLEASE READ THE COUPON!"}
{"text":"Skimpy on the beef and won't honor FREE COOKIE coupon. All it takes is to READ IT - it says free with ANY full-price purchase, NOT free with any full-price SANDWICH. GEEZE !"}
{"text":"This establishment is childish. The amount of wait time has been at a frozen snails pace. Professionalism by the staff has been ...to say it's been sub-par would be an insult to sub-par service. It's ridiculous. You can't help but empathize for the patrons who were there before you who are waiting for food reparations. It appears time management is the curse that killed this place. The cooks don't have it, and the front line don't have the initiative to help out when things are moving slowly. Is it generational?"}
{"text":"I like Arby's food. However, probably the biggest component of eating out is the service. This location has some of the rudest people working for it. I can understand a bad day or two, but even some of the management is consistently and incredibly rude. I would highly recommend another location or something else."}
{"text":"Never had issues here and love their service and food. Had 1 slow time here and it was because the new guy was kinda sluggish and seemed like he did not wanna be there."}
{"text":"I was desperately hungry late one night with no other options. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich meal and now I have food poisoning. My guess is that it was that suspect sauce you put on that sandwich. Or maybe its the fact that you are Arby's. Why don't you do us all a favor and set the place on fire and collect the insurance money and be on your way."}
{"text":"Needs some improvement. Employees out in lobby with manager instead of with trainee. One girl in back fixing all food no help from others as well as girl in Drive thru by herself. Manager needs to get it together. Lobby nasty needs cleaning"}
{"text":"Great food, even better service! One of my pet peeves getting old fries with my food, they dropped fries fresh just for my order.  Also I dropped my drink and spilled it all over, the kid smiled and said \"no problems, that's what a mop is for.\" I was happly surprised with their great attitudes."}
{"text":"my garlic parmesan chips were under cooked, not crispy AT ALL, and way over seasoned. Over all gross and a waste of money."}
{"text":"Fast drive through just before 5pm! Got everything hot or cold( shake) and with a smile!"}
{"text":"I am appalled at the service I received tonight at store #7168 on Craig Road and Martin Luther King Jr Blvd. I place my order at the drive through speaker, which consisted of two \"beef and cheddar classics\", one \"French dip\", one \"brown sugar blt \" and three large curly fries. The man at the window was very quick to take my money at 19:21 (7:21pm) in the amount of $24.60, but from there we were made to wait 14 minutes before he even came back to let us know that he was \"sorry for the delay\". In this time there were three employees standing at the counter looking in our bags trying to figure out what was happening, two of which were opening the boxes of the French dip and the blt without gloves. There hands, which I saw handling money from in store customers, was then touching the inside of the boxes of my food. This is not only unprofessional but also extremely unsanitary! I will be calling the Southern Nevada Health Department as soon as I conclude this very dissatisfied letter. 

My grandparents took me to Arby's as a treat when I was a child, and now I am disgusted by once treasured memory. 
 

Sincerely,
A very irate former customer"}
{"text":"It seems like everytime my Fiance and I go there they mess up our orders. This one doesn't serve breakfast."}
{"text":"I haven't even gotten my food yet, but I'm sure that part is fine. However, I just wanted to say that Cody, the cashier here, strikes me as one of those guys that won't say \"thank you\" when you hold the door open for him. He probably also won't hold the door open for older people or anyone, really. The constant gum chewing was obnoxious. He was rude, brah. If I owned this place, he wouldn't have a job. Just sayin."}
{"text":"This location always turns out to be really convenient because it's attached to a BP gas station.  It's really cool when you can fill up your tank, buy a few snacks and pick up lunch or dinner.  The location is very clean and the staff is professional and always courteous.  The only confusing thing about the setup, is that the condiments are located around the corner in the dining room near the soda machine.

One note for chocolate lovers:  If you're a big fan of the chocolate turnovers like I am; you'll want to get there before 9:30 pm, because they have a tendency to run out of those pretty early."}
{"text":"I ordered a roast beef, fries, and drink. The food was cold and looked like it wasn't cooked all the way. I got it to-go and didn't want to go back and complain."}
{"text":"Back again many times.  Always the food is made fresh, always get out orders right, always honor our coupons.  Always hire nice, polite kids, never a problem with my daughter's gluten allergy.  Our order is always special order (no buns, etc) but they make our meals with a smile on their faces.  

Great arby's location."}
{"text":"Stopped here for the first time on a Friday around 6pm. Place was spotless. While waiting for my order I noticed something I've never seen in a fast food restaurant: Excellent customer service. Cashier was smiling and was very pleasant. The MOD wasn't standing around barking orders, instead she was working as hard as everyone else. Drive through was 20 cars deep so I chose to go inside and, for the first time ever, I'm glad I did. That crew should be a model for every other Arby's in the nation."}
{"text":"I went to this Arby's to get dinner for my family a couple weeks ago.. I went thru the drive thru and ordered a smokehouse brisket sandwich and onion rings for myself .. the sandwich was ok..no where near as tasty as it looked on tv.. my onion rings were so soggy and they tasted like they'd been sitting there all day..gross! My husband had the french dip with au jus and potato cakes.. his sandwich looked like it had been stepped on and the au jus was so salty it was completely inedible .. his potato cakes were soggy but he enjoyed them anyhow.. my son had the ruben and curly fries.. his sandwich was skimpy and soggy.. he liked his fries..we live closeby this Arby's so the food should not have been as sogged out as it was.. also the worker shoved all six items into a relatively small bag.. it's a shame because we love the food at other Arby's in our area..this particular Arby's will no longer receive our business.. there are tons of tastier fast food places to go around here!"}
{"text":"The worst Arby's I have ever eaten at. If you want a good one, visit the one on Park. 
So, here is why it is bad.
1) the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered. Four different sandwiches. This is compared to other Arby's I've eaten at.
2) they say they don't have any monthly deals. I was told they belong to the same owner as the one on Park and they have monthly deals.
3) tried it twice and both times they messed up our order. We paid but did not get things.
4) their customer service is awful
I don't expect much in life but when I go somewhere to give them my money , I expect better than what I got here."}
{"text":"They are great. Service is always friendly. They take an order and fill it right the first time. I go there more often because they do it right. You may think \"how hard is it to fill an order?\" Through out my life, it seems that filling an order correctly is getting harder and harder. Maybe because they don't take time to listen to the order being placed.
In my opinion, the two best fast food places in the area are 1) this Arby's and 2)Popeyes on Fish Hatchery."}
{"text":"I just want to say that for a fast good restaurant the customer service is excellent. The food is always ok (but I don't expect if to be wonderful for $7). I went Monday 12/10 and the young man working the drive thru window was very pleasant. Asked if here was anything else I needed and had a friendly demeanor. I would go back to a place like Arbys to be treated with respect before I went to a different fast food restaurant! Good Customer service always makes you come back!"}
{"text":"Food is fine. Be careful in the drive through. Every time I go through there I curb my tires on the curb by the window. It is not marked very well. I forget about it almost every time then,bam! I have ruined the white letters on my tires and scratched my rims because of this drive through."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for lunch, today.  It was the worst service I've ever experienced.  Seriously.  First, the girl taking our order at the counter showed more interest in her coworker and what he was saying (not work related), then taking our order and receiving our payment.  In fact. she gave us a view of the back of her head so she could better hear what the plans of her coworker was.  Once that part was over, we walked away to look for  table.  The tables were dirty.  We had to clean one in order to sit down  We waited and waited for our order.  When we looked over, the employees (all 3 of them)  were huddled together, one leaning on the prep counter, to talk about who knows what.  I heard several times from the girl about her \"office\" and meeting up to chat.  
We finally received our order.  The curly fries tasted like cardboard, the fried onions on our brisket sandwich were stale.  Just gross!.  I'll never go back  Ever.
The restaurant was not busy at all.  No excuse!"}
{"text":"You get zero (0)...  Since when did Arby's start putting unchewable ingredients into it's already quasi-roast beef?  What was the red crap dripping out of the beef and cheddar?  When did you begin to slice the roast beef 2 or 3 times as thick as you used to?  Maybe that's why it's so f'in hard to chew...  A clear waste of time and money to be thrown out.   I'm hoping it's only this location.   Never again to this store.   -Consumer Geek..."}
{"text":"Plenty of people working but they just stare. Don't take your order, sit in the office, stand around in back or wait for another drive thru to come in. Don't even say I'll be right with you."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes, Arby's is up there in terms of quality and taste. I love their chicken sandwiches and their curly fries are definitely something that I crave. It's also nice that they have a wide selection of sauces available."}
{"text":"Arby's in general can serve good tasting food so don't think poorly of the Arby's brand.

This specific store, on the other hand, has a history of serving undercooked or otherwise poor quality food.

I've ordered here every so often, and a majority of the time I have received under-cooked chicken, or under-cooked fries, the only good thing is that they sell pepsi and it's hard to mess that one up.

I'd avoid this specific restaurant."}
{"text":"Dropped by to pick up 8 sandwiches, staff was courteous & helpful. A good experience, and the roast beef was great."}
{"text":"What can be said? An Arby's is an Arby's as far as fast food went.  The service was friendly and warmly given on a day that had me stressed out. I found it pleasant there, and will eat there again before I leave the area."}
{"text":"If you're under 50, or older with a poor memory, you likely don't know that in the early 1970s Arby's was known as \"Arby's Real Roast Beef\", and it was real. The 'real\" part was actually on the bottom of their outdoor sign, and perhaps even underlined.  You won't find ANY reference to this on the company website or under their Wikipedia \"history\" page - strange?  Back then, the restaurants intentionally placed their slicer containing a huge chunk of genuine roast beef where everyone could see it.  Their sandwiches were, as you would guess, superb.  

I can't remember exactly when the chain made the 'conversion' to pressed and formed imitation roast beef, but the current product is nothing more than a poor man's lunch meat ala Subway.  Several years ago, it occurred to me to ask a store manager why they had stopped selling genuine roast beef and he gave me some fairy tale story about a shortage of \"quality\" beef.  I do on rare occasion fool myself into buying one of their \"roast beef\" sandwiches, but more than one visit every few years reminds you of why you stopped eating them.  The dead-gray flaps of \"roast beef\" under the bun are quite unappetizing, so it goes down a little easier if you don't look.  

I couldn't - in good conscience  - recommend eating these faux roast beef sandwiches to anyone.  It is a shame some entrepreneur hasn't opened a chain of restaurants replicating the real roast beef sandwiches of back when.  I would pay $6 - $7 for the real thing. But I can still choke down one of the current Arby's offerings - about once every Leap Year."}
{"text":"I went to this Arby's on a Thursday night around 9pm. I don't know what the manager on duty's name was, but he was super friendly and very nice. Got my food out quick and just a genuinely nice person."}
{"text":"I left my purse and these kind souls held it for me. Oh and the food was great as always."}
{"text":"Place is really kept clean and looking good. Staff very friendly and fast ! I would have to say it's the best managed fast food place   downtown."}
{"text":"Although I'm a great fan of Arby's roast beef I have to honestly say that the apple crisp was one of the worst tasting things I have ever eaten at Arby's."}
{"text":"I enjoy Arby's. the food isn't half bad. What I don't like is constantly having items left out of my order in the drive thru. This is a normal practice here in belmont for these drive thru places. None are good a couple are decent.  This Arby's gets this two stars because the last few times I've come here after work around 10:30pm (they close at 11pm) they have forgotten stuff from my order. Now, I obviously can't call since by the time I leave and get home they are now closed and won't care to answer a phone.  Of course nobody would believe me if I went on my next trip there and explained I'm owed a few sandwiches either. So I have to accept that i overpaid for half our order. Another thing, to the owner if you care at all about your franchise, maybe don't have your people turn everyone single light off except the kitchen lights by 10:30.  If I wasn't a local, maybe a person off the highway hungry I'd think the place was close. Of course the employees want customers to think that anyway that's why they turn off all the lights. God forbid you have to microwave some food 30 minutes before close. You need $15 am hour for that right? Everything would change then. They might even offer to make yo food after hours even when the big bucks are being made . 

TL:DR avoid belmont area drive thrus.  If possible order inside and don't leave until all items have been taken out of bag and accounted for."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice when you walk in the dining room door is that the floor is filthy everywhere you look.  With the dining room trashcans filled to overflowing, I was resolved not to check the restroom!  The noise is so loud that it's virtually impossible to hear the cashier,  but with the rude way the manager on duty was talking to the employees I wasn't anxious to hear anything else once we got our order in.

We sat down to wait for our order to be filled and I realized that they were preparing sandwiches and fried potatoes (of several types) over greatly overflowing garbage cans!!  I can see if they get busy that the dining room cans might suffer for attention for a minute, but if you're endangering my food by stuffing it into a bag while holding the bag over a can literally flowing over with food garbage then I have to wonder at the standards of this place. What puzzles me is why there was an OPEN trashcan piled up so high right at the sandwich prep area AND the potato station - why have trash right where you are putting folks' food into bags? I'd bet the folks who have only ever come thru the drive lane didn't know their food was being prepped in a virtual garbage dump,  and that's why WE didn't use the drive thru!!! 

The back door had over-full trash bags piled up waist high, and the flattened (and unflattened) cardboard boxes piled up over those served to cover more than half the floor in the storage room (at the back of the kitchen). If anyone had to use that door to get out in the event of a fire, they would have to wade through 4 feet of trash and garbage just to get to the danged door - how safe can it be???  

For a new location, they've really set a low standard. We've been in twice, and will not go back. In fact, this time we made a point of going to the dining get room because the last time we were here it was similarly dirty and neither of us fancied having our food made in a place whose standards of cleanliness are clearly not what they are supposed to be. Given that there has been absolutely ZERO improvement, we won't return.  If I wanted food prepared in such a garbage-laden environment....well.....I've never been in a *restaurant* so dirty, so I can't even make a comparison. Suffice to say, if the health inspector had showed up while we were there they would have CLOSED THE DOORS. 

Having staff so surly and rude doesn't help either, and it's downright embarrassing to have to listen to a manager call out an employee for doing exactly what they've been taught to do.  The woman who was the manager on duty today wasn't shy about addressing the other workers as subordinates, and their responses to being asked to do things that they should *know* to do (like emptying the trash, for pet's sake!) doesn't speak well for their pride in their job. The last time we came in the whole lot stopped to turn and watch every customer come in, including us. This time, the music was very loud and they didn't slow down long enough to even speak, much less be polite (or anything else).  Not a very welcoming place, no matter how you cut it.

Arby's is our favorite fast food, but not at THIS location! We will continue to go out of our way to Pineville, Lancaster, or even uptown Charlotte before we will patronize this place again.  I'm so flabbergasted by the filth that I can't even see straight - I have NEVER been in a fast food place that was this carelessly kept and that hadn't changed an iota from what it was the last time we came here, over a month ago.  The staff hasn't improved, either, so I guess the quality of the staff sorta matches the cleanliness of the store,  sad as I am to say it.  This is a good location, and Arby's has a great menu, too; too bad that's the only generalized reputation this location can maintain because it certainly doesn't meet the standards of any other Arby's I've ever been in!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Arbys in Pittsburgh!Food is always good and fresh.Customer service is excellent! Met my fiance here 4 years ago while I was working at the TXRH across the street. And were still together to this day! Keep up the good work baby your staff loves you and so do I!"}
{"text":"I eat here a lot it's close to my house and been eating here for years. With that said... the last year this place is gone way down hill. I ordered a grand turkey club cold no tomatoes X2 and few other items of no importance. I repeated to the girl taking my order total of 4 or 5 times and reminded her to let the guys in the back know to make cold no tomatoes. She walked back there and when my order was complete she said to me everything I asked for verbatim. I told her thank you and sorry if I sound like a jerks but I don't want to pay for something I don't want. I was very thankful thinking I received good service until I went home and found one hot with tomato and the other cold and not editable due to old dry bun. So I returned and spoke to manager. He asked if he could remake the sandwich and I agreed and said cold no tomatoes he said he was personally going to make my sandwich. I had the receipt and my bad sandwich which another employee asked if I wanted it.... being a bit perplexed I said no throw it away that's why I'm here complaining. When the sandwich was finished the manager had another employee hand me the bag. Not very good customer service.
The kicker is I got home and it was a carved turkey sandwich! HOT even! Totally different sandwich.  I called back and contacting general manager tomorrow. This place sucks save your money and eat else where."}
{"text":"After our flight into Mesa, our friends decided to grab a quick lunch to go from Arby's.  I chose the specialty on the flyer found at a my friend's house--a pastrami sandwich with curly fries.

Nothing beats hunger from:
1. Waking up at 5 a.m., 
2. Being holed up in a plane for nearly 2 hours with LOUD, obnoxious baseball fans coming to watch Spring Training, 
3. And being blasted by 90-degree weather at 10:30 a.m.

..Except, of course, pastrami on rye, with melted cheese on sauerkraut with a handful of curly fries, Diet Dr. Pepper, and Jalapeno poppers with raspberry sauce!  I must say, this is some good junk food, my friends, good junk food!!"}
{"text":"The general manager Becky at this location is very rude! I showed her an online coupon that did not state one per customer (clearly Arby's fault! ) and she was clearly pissed off at me. Slamming stuff around an yelling to the other workers \"I knew this was going to happen\" I do not normally eat here and this was their one shot at potentially gaining me as a regular customer but no thanks to Becky I won't be returning even for free food! Horrible customer service training Arby's!! This is your management???"}
{"text":"This place is the worst fucking drive thru ever. Damn so slow. Been waiting for freaking 20mins. The fuck! Why they call it fast food if it's damn slow. Don't come here u wasting your time and gas."}
{"text":"I believe \" Matt\"was his name at the register and let me just say that is customer service!!! He was really nice on recommending what was good and very patient... Good employee thumbs up for him!"}
{"text":"This is the closest Arby's to our house unfortunately. I have given it three tries and I won't be back. There is no management visible. It is run by teenagers, not adults. It takes a very long time, like 20 minutes to get the food. It is NOT fast food. The food sits on the trays because it is poorly staffed so it is cold when we get it. The last two times I got home and was missing food and had to go back. This time I will check. Not impressed and we like Arby's, but we will choose a different food from now on."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Went here at 9:35 and the guy ignored me completely.  (Closes at 10).  Even blew off the next guy in line to prove my point. Fast food is guaranteed a death sentence. Good bye."}
{"text":"I went to this Arby's last night placed an order for 14 people and unfortunately they ran out of the standard buns for my sandwich and unlike most fast food places they gave me a good variety of options to replace even offering to give my money back and tell me where the next closest Arby's was. They were apologetic and truly sorry I felt like they actually cared that I was inconvenienced I will be going back just because although the food was great the service was phenomenal"}
{"text":"This Arby's sucks. They've given me cold sandwiches two separate times and they're poorly slapped together..it's literally bread and a chunk of meat idk how u can screw that up"}
{"text":"A few moments ago my girlfriend and I encountered what had to be the most disgusting chicken sandwich known to fricken mankind! I wasn't even able to choke down a single bite, it felt as if I was chewing on a chunk of rubber. My girlfriend however was able to find eatable morsels around the edges, where the breading overpowers the rubber. After overcoming my urge to vomit, I went on to try to feed the chicken to my dog, who favored licking his asshole over trying to eat the hunk of grissle being passed off as a chicken sandwich. Please don't waste five bucks on this poor excuse of a restaurant! I mean I wasn't expecting much but its honestly surprising how they screwed up a
 piece of meat this bad! Even the frozen chicken shelled out by the grocery stores puts this crap to shame!"}
{"text":"Walked into this arbys today and to start off they are super friendly they greet you and are all happy with positive attitudes! They offer ice cold water right in the front. Also was well organized and clean! I ordered a couple of things and they were all fresh. For sure coming back."}
{"text":"None of my co-workers enjoy Arby's like I do, and I'm starting to see why. I go here often for lunch/dinner, only to be continuously disappointed with the lack of meat on the sandwiches. I ordered 4 Classic Roast Beef sandwiches (over $3 per sandwich) expecting to save some for an afternoon snack. I later found out, that I would have needed 6 just to satisfy my lunch appetite (which is rather average). There were MAYBE 2 slabs of roast beef on each sandwich. Pathetic. Might as well just eat the bread. There was no line in the drive through but yet the service was still slow. Then when I asked for bbq and horseradish sauce (for 4 sandwiches) she gave me a pinch of each. Please stop being so jewish. And please do something about the awful bump at the entrance of the parking lot from Monroe street. It's way too high for average sedans to get over without scraping or bottom-ing out. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because the little amount of food I got was, indeed, tasty."}
{"text":"I went to the Drive Thur this afternoon. There were 4 cars in front of me and it took 20 minutes to get my food. Donna, who was working the drive thur, poorly I might add, was also lacking in ANY customer service skills what so ever. If I owned this business, I would Not want someone like her representing my brand. 

The food was okay, but because of the way I was treated, I will never go back."}
{"text":"Very nice Arby's. The employees are polite and provide fast and accurate service. The restaurant is comfortable and clean. The food was fresh and warm."}
{"text":"Service was slow. I've been here before and its always been slow. No one in like in front of me but it took them a long time because the fries weren't ready. Diet soda extremely foamy. Had to keep pouring the foam off to fill. Ketchup dispenser was also out of ketchup. They had a sign up to give them feedback, but they didn't give me a receipt so I couldn't even give them feedback. Beyond that, typical Arby's. At least the food tasted good."}
{"text":"Though it is just a fast food restaurant I was very impressed with their customer service. The place it self is always clean, and the employees are super friendly. I was with my mom, and she didn't order a soda but she wanted a sip of mine. The employee (Carl), hearing this gave us a small soda free of charge. He even gave us 2 extra jalapeño poppers! Thanks Carl!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give Arby's a chance for lunch. The food was as good as ever. It's been a while.  Only three stars. Minus one for the wait.  Minus one for no WiFi. Where do you go today that doesn't offer free WiFi?"}
{"text":"It's a fairly new Arby's near downtown. It's right across the street from the new Best Buy, which is next to the new Target and Home Depot. 

I know people like to hate on Arby's, but for some reason they are the only fast food place that doesn't make my stomach hurt. I usually get the French Dip, which for the price is actually pretty decent. Service is usually quick and friendly, and the store is never crowded. 

It's a good option if you're downtown and wanting a quick fast food run."}
{"text":"Arbys is so much better now that a new manager works there.I give big props to Adam! He keeps everyone happy like any manger would. I just want to know why isnt he the GM???..Scott hes just a sweet guy hes fast ,clean and friendly!arby looks clean! Everyones friendly and the environment feels good now that Adam is working here! I love coming into a good manager and facility.I dont like Arlette so much I see how she works and shes always in her office.the  performance of the workers  at its best with Scott and Adam leading the team! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I found nothing wrong. Nice staff. Food was fine. No complients here :) mananger was super cool.!"}
{"text":"Order a coke something tasted funny about it .. I ask to return it and looked like I asked to much .. the doctor pepper was no better ..
Ordered a chicken walnut that was ok and the  cheese n beef was good .."}
{"text":"Just got the new Pork Belly Sandwich...Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Showed up 30 mins before they close and sure enough already closed. Not to mention the entire stall was already gone. Kinda crazy especially for it being the holiday season. If you're going to close at 9:30 then you should change your hours."}
{"text":"I second that - excellent customer service! By far the best I've experienced in a long time. Every employee treated each customer with respect...from the moment they walked in, during their meal, and right as they walked out the door. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! And I even witnessed a couple times where an employee helped another employee out - true teamwork. Oh yeah, the food was good too :) thank you, Arby's! I will be back."}
{"text":"Its been years since I've eaten at an Arby's but I will say the Aliante Arby's has to be one of the best. Staff was courteous and the drive thru was fast. Overall very pleased and will return when back in that area."}
{"text":"It has the same food as any other Arby's, but the lunch crew is remarkably friendly and helpful.  When a frozen icy snow pile blocked my wheelchair's path in, the manager showed up with a shovel and dug a path right away.

Pretty damn alert and responsive for a bunch of teens and twenty-somethings. This owner's hiring the right people."}
{"text":"The best Arby's and fast food restaurant around. Excellent customer service. Employees are friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant is clean and food is hot and fresh. I go to this restaurant very often and highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Love the beef and cheddar, and the potatoes cakes are to die for, The girl that waiting on me was very friendly, and made me feel important to them, I would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"soooooooooooooo disappointed.  This location has good times and really bad times, last night around 7:00 pm was a really bad time.  As you can see in the picture the places was almost empty, stuff stacked all over the counter and signs saying they are out of lots of things like arby sauce?  we ordered four things and all were wrong.  Tried new brisket sandwich waited 15 minutes it came out cold, in a box the top of the bun was half off the sandwich there was only the equivalent of 4 pieces of meat a little dab of bbq sauce and four tiny little pieces of fried onion ring. OMG are you kidding me for almost 6$!  Not anywhere near the representation of the picture advertised I would say this is false advertisement! It was cold too!  The other sandwich was their new big brisket with belly bacon, it also was cold, it was greasy, it was very cold yukkkkkk!  Most of it went in the garbage.  We had a classic supreme medium size, they must have been short on meat because it was not more then a classic size of meat, terrible piece of lettuce leaf shoved in it, the meat was warm but the sandwich was cold.  Super disappointing for my favorite arby sandwich.  Did I say the lettuce omg it was so bad, inedible big leafy thing!  We had an order of potatoe cakes they must have been sitting someplace for 20 minutes, they were also cold, limp and uneatable.  I went to complain at the counter. nobody was there after standing there ten minutes we left.  I will not go back to this location again.  20$ spent on something not worth eating most of which we threw away.  I want my money back!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to go, you don't get your food that you ordered and  then they charge you for someone else bill.  I called the manager, at least he said he was and he couldn't even communicate.. Oh haha I just told someone I left your food out and then told me he can't watch everything.....no more chances this is like 5 times....nothing changes....not even 1 star"}
{"text":"It's an Arby's, so no need to go into decor or menu selection and the such.  I eat at several different Arby's though, and this one has its good and bad.  First the good:

Food's always been hot, fresh, and delivered quicklly.  More quickly than at most Arby's I go to.  Not sure if I keep lucking out at this location or if everyone notices this, but it's been true on SEVERAL occasions.  Speedy service & nice enough.

The bad:

The music is horrible crap that my great-grandparents probably listened to growing up, and I'm 40.  Seriously - it's not \"classic\" by any stretch, not even just \"old\" - it's downright ancient.  ALWAYS.  They never change it, doesn't matter who's working or when you go.  You won't recognize a single tune unless you're 120 years old, and if that were the case you probably wouldn't remember it anyway.  I love classic rock and even old school Mowtown and the such, but this is beyond anything I've ever heard in a public place.  And it's annoying, especially when you're trying to enjoy a large Beef-n-Cheddar.  I had to literally throw the sandwich down my throat as fast as I could just to try to avoid getting a headache from the awful crooning coming through the cheesy Muzak machine, and even that didn't work.  I'm getting a headache just thinking about it now! 

It's either the drive-thru or a trip to the Sonic, Wendy's or Jack in the Box right next to this Arby's next time.  I've given them at least a half a dozen chances to change their tunes, but they keep playing it.  No more dining room eating in this location for me!

Oh yea - one more bad thing - there's a manager who likes to belittle her staff in front of customers sometimes.  At least I've heard it once or twice, and that's just not cool.  Minus 1/2 for occasional management actions, minus 1 1/2 for being too stupid to play music that is more universally acceptable in a public place.  Who makes that decision anyway?  Rap, Country, Death Metal - there's a reason businesses don't pipe this kind of music through their places.  It's annoying to most people who aren't part of that niche of listeners.  Same goes for anything that was old enough to be recorded on 8-tracks but not popular enough to be recorded onto CD's!

You've got good food Arby's Henderson - now get a clue!  Change the music."}
{"text":"I have to begin this review by admitting that Every time I pass this Arby's, I wonder who actually eats here. Apparently me. So, why was I not surprised when even though I was the only car in the drive-through, I waited for over eight minutes for my food. At least it was hot. Well, part of it was. It was crunch time, and next time it's crunch time I think I'll just reach for the granola bars I keep underneath my car seat and keep driving. Not fast, not great."}
{"text":"Rated 2nd cleanest Arby's in the United States! Excellent facility, service and good!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have eaten at this Arby's 3 times in the last 2 weeks. We keep going back because it is just that good. The French Dip sandwich is really wonderful and I have been unable to try anything else because it really is that good. The staff is friendly, the place is clean and all the food including the sweet tea tastes just great. This Arby's has become our new go to fast food place."}
{"text":"Super fast and cold AC! New chicken sandwiches are pretty dang good, especially the buffalo one. Genuine staff"}
{"text":"Service was good, friendly.  Prices for the food seem to be getting a lot more expensive but the food is still good.  I tried the smokehouse brisket sandwich for the first time and it was phenomenal.  I'd definitely recommend it..........and will order it again."}
{"text":"I was on my way to the grocery store, which is about a 3mile walk for me, and I walked into Arby's to get a drink, because Arizona is a swirling hellfire, and the girl behind the register was so sweet and gave me a soft drink for free after seeing how hot and sweaty I was from walking outside. Really nice people."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through and they didn't have sweet or unsweetened tea, nor did they have the chocolate milkshake, all of which are on the menu, so requested ice water instead.  Then was charged for combo with a small drink of Pepsi.  Total came to $8.96.   Ridiculous.  Terrible service."}
{"text":"The new sliders are good. But when we went there today they were out of mozzarella sticks."}
{"text":"I'm really craving a Philly sand which so i pull up to the drive Thru to order, I want to see if they have anything new and as I'm telling the person that's on the mic to give me a few second they say that he isn't rushing me but i need to order within the next 4 min because his register automatically closes on its own, Ive never heard that in my entire life. I think that is the worst excuse to tell someone, First off you never rush a costumer second if you dint close until a 10pm or whenever you close you have to take the costumer no matter what. I wouldn't even give this place 1 star but i had to because it says so. i believe that this is not good quality costumer service its not like I'm ordering something that's going to take 45min. i will not ever be going back here because that kind of service is not inviting."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to come to this location. Management is excellent and the service is fast. The food is always hot and tasty. For a quick meal and great service, come here."}
{"text":"Great drive up service,the gentleman actually counted back my change,with a smile.You just don't get that in fast food any more."}
{"text":"Who taste good like always very poor customer service went through the drive-through Took 15 minutes to get my food The girl working the drive-through was very rude and said my truck smells like gasand I already realize I have car issues LOL"}
{"text":"Service is sub-rate at this Arby's I was locked in the drive thru for 35 minutes of  total disrespect to clientele. When I asked why I was told walk in customers were more important. I'll never return to this location which is sad because it's in my area."}
{"text":"Nothing over the top , but they always get it right. For fast food the quality of the food is more than acceptable and the value is good. The service is what stands out to me. The store is clean and we'll kept , the staff is friendly with a smile and my food has NEVER been wrong."}
{"text":"I love there roast beef, always Will! Tried their \"special limited time\" sandwich, WOW WHAT A JOKE!! No wonder every Arbys on Yelp are either CLOSED DOWN OR 2 STAR...I don't think JOKE is a biggest enough Insult. $10.00 for a combo that is ridiculously thrown together with old products. You have officially lost a loyal customer. I WAS loyal, 2 combos $25  for SLOP is last draw!! Here is pics, you judge this noscence for yourself, u decide if this slop worth $10 to you, me, I'm done"}
{"text":"HI,
 I think Arby's Restaurant in Chardon on Water St. should go out of Business. There not Really making any Money nor Business. I happen to go by there & see that there parking lot is not producing any Customers. Very Few if any. This is on a everyday occurrence. Day, afternoon, & evening. 7 days a week during weekdays. I happen to live not that far from there & Notice this. Weather it's there Restaurant or Drive Thru. I still think they should \"GO\" out of \"Business\". The only places that see that are making Business is Taco Bell, Mcdonalds, & Burger King. Arby's is not. I hope to see something done about this really soon so they do go out of Business. 
                                           Thank you!
                                                   Jim!"}
{"text":"So today I thought I would give this arbys location another shot since I haven't been there in over four years . The reason being last time I was there I spent 30 in in the drive thru and they still screwed my order up . Today was no exception except I went inside to the counter . And again I had to wait 25 min to receive my order . They only had 3 employees working for a Friday night . One counter person , one drive thru person and one cook . After the individual in front of me gave his order , the employee stepped away from the counter to fill orders for ten minutes . Well once again I will not go back to arbys . Food sucks , over priced and under staffed ."}
{"text":"Once again, another fast food place strives for sub-par service.  I should have known there would be a problem when I had to repeat my order 4 times at the drive through. After I pay for it, I'm told to \"pull around front, we'll bring your food out to you when it's ready\".  I hate it when they say that. Well, I pull up front....and wait...and wait...and wait. 

  Enough of this already, so I get out of my car and go inside. After explaining everything to what looked like a 16 year old \"manager\", she proclaims \"oh, your fries are done now, here you go\".  I go through the bag inspecting the order. What do you know? They messed it up, of course! After that was fixed, I'm totally pissed off at them, so I just take the bag and leave.  

  Well, I get home and discover there were more fubars with the order. The sandwich I wanted was not the one I got. I ordered a plain roast beef...I got the one swimming in that nasty cheese and watered down BBQ sauce. I'm not going to waste my gas taking it back to complain (perhaps they count on that). Couldn't even eat it by hand. The bottom of the bun was so drenched in that horrible sauce, it fell apart as I picked it up. Had to eat the meat with a fork! 

  Arby's, you suck!! I hate you and I hope you choke to death on your own crappy food prepared by your own narcissistic brain dead moronic employees!!!"}
{"text":"Delish curly fries and Pepsi soda selection. The Arby BBQ sauce compliments the fries. Certainly faster service than other nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"Tonight I went there for the first time. I asked for extra ranch dressing. I guess extra ranch means no ranch. Customer service is very important to me and if you can't remember to put in a sauce, that's a one and done. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I have to tell you guys. Arby's is my equivalent to a personal lord and savior. Some people may say that it's not real beef but honestly, have you tried their Beef and Cheddars!?!  It would barely affect me if they said it was roadkill off I80 in Nebraska. 

Mix that with their perfectly crispy potato cakes and really, why go anywhere else?

The location is clean. The people are nice. No one judges me as I inhale cheddar covered beef doused in Arby sauce. Thank you for that.

Five stars for everything. ONE STAR DEDUCTION for not allowing me to buy my Arby's beef in bulk size. Come on guys, help a sister out."}
{"text":"Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!"}
{"text":"One on my worst fast food experiences in years! Honestly cold food to the touch; it's illegal and needs to be fixed. My order was incorrect, and missing items. The phone never gets answered. Probably from the amount of complaints they get per day. What's the point? Or, just their embarrasement to how bad they serve their guests. I really don't care, I just want people to beware this location! I will defiantly never return to this very Arby's location myself. Truly horrible!"}
{"text":"Very good staff and they made my sandwich well done which is the way I like it. I have been trying to get all Arbys to do this ."}
{"text":"Very slow and very backed up. The drive thru was slow so I went into the lobby, they weren't even busy, it took over 10 minutes to get a just a simple sandwich.  Maybe just inadequately staffed?"}
{"text":"The Sun Prairie Arby's gives  new definition to fast food - if fast means waiting 13 minutes after I placed my order and I still did not have my food.  They should ask people to park to the side as similar chains do if their food is going to take a while to prepare.I finally said to heck with it and drove off.  My comparison is based on my experiences with the Abrams Arby's which we stop at 20 plus times a year when we go north.  It has never been more than 4 minutes from the time we walk in the door to the time we have our food and they are truly busy."}
{"text":"I only had 1 issue 1 time and that was when my husband and I decided to sit indoors to eat and our order somehow got erased.  The manager apologized, gave my husband a shake while we had to wait longer and all was made good.  Food is always hot when going through drive-through, so no complaints there.  I guess nobody notices that there is parking by the drive-thry window which is also pretty cool."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Food was ready in a timely fashion and employees went above and beyond to be friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I've been to many Arby's and this was by far this worst I've ever been to. I ordered through the drive-thru and elected to wait for a chicken sandwich to be cooked however, it was in fact not cooked all the way through and I nearly puked biting into the middle of raw chicken. The fries were the burnt leftovers sitting for hours I'm sure. I will never be returning to this location."}
{"text":"well last night i go through the drive through got home order was not right went back tonight to get my order the workers and the worker that called the night manger in few words your lieing we get poeple in here all the time trying to get free food. wtf arby coustermer services sucks staff lies out of about 25 for food that right down steling from me azzholes"}
{"text":"Arby's may have the meat but they also have your receipt after you place your order.  This is violation of fare and simple business ethics to a customer.  Twice now I have asked Walter for my receipt after purchasing food, only to be told It would come with my order.  Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.  Walter has about as much charm and customer service as a cadaver.  Customers should be entitled to a receipt at the time of purchase and upon request.  Arby's prints two receipts, one goes in the drawer and the other might come on your tray.  Arby's writes your name on the receipt and calls your name when the order is ready.  This generates confusion when two or more same name customers walk up and start pawing the food, or when a customer returns your food because it wasn't theirs.  A numerical system is smarter than a name system.  Customers are entitled proof of purchase and how much they spent at the time of purchase and not later.  I dine out often and find it easier to correct mistakes at that time instead of having to call my bank or return to a business.  I don't appreciate this inconvenience for my business.  How about figuring out a better system Arby's."}
{"text":"The Philly sandwhich was not at all what it looks like on tv. It was tiny and barely anything on it at all. The service drive thru was rude and didnt want to be bothered. I won't be there again for sure."}
{"text":"Dinning room was not impressive and needs renovating. Between order counter and condiment table floor needed serious cleaning. Sandwich looked barely thrown together compared to other locations. This Arbys did not offer pepper sauce which I have seen at all other locations. Did not offer ANY military discount which all other locations have offered even if only slight. The only good thing about this place is that the food came fast although I think that he quality of the sandwich and the lack of other customers during the height of lunch hour was the only reason it did come fast."}
{"text":"Personally the best Arby's I've ever been to. I don't see how some people say it is slow, eating in is always quick and easy and drive through is of course fast. The food there is high quality for it being fast food and they have never messed up an order of mine."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a one star because of the wait in the drive through and that this is the second time they have gotten my order wrong. Ordered grand turkey club, drove home and discovered a large roast beef sandwich in the bag instead. My receipt had what I requested so not sure how they messed it up. Just skip this place."}
{"text":"Expect to be in the drive through for quite a while (20 min for us). Came through right after work around five. Ordered for my whole family and when I came home the order wasn't correct,  even though the receipt was correct. Very disappointed since we don't get to go food often and the fact that it's so expensive."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon about 1:45 PM and I just saw Norma the cashier here at the Arby's restaurant on Stephanie I wanted to order a salad and on the menu the salad stated that there's only chicken and the turkey for the meat on the salad however when I looked at their ad there was a Gyro salad and I would've ordered that salad so I'm so disappointed that Norma I did not I provide me the option of ordering the Gyro salad service is so poor and she did not look like she was so interested in serving me and yet she was employee of the month I sometime this year terrible I'm never coming back never ever and I am a loyal customer for Arby's"}
{"text":"The manager Amanda can not get her shit together does not care about the customers. I will be calling in to report this."}
{"text":"This doesn't even taste like a beef n cheddar. What really sucks is I drove all the way home to discover the fries aren't even done. The meat looks old and greasy and nobody will answer the phone."}
{"text":"I think if you go to Arby's you know what you are getting into and compared to some of the other Arby's it's pretty good. Granted, it's never going to be perfect, this is fast good not fine dining.  I have received under cooked fried foods, and some dishes are overly spicy. Limit menu, i'd rather go else where, but for what it is, this place is decent."}
{"text":"Had the most delicious meal here. Excellent customer service, very clean and we'll kept. You just don't have this kind of experience much anymore. I will be definitely be back. Thank you Arby's."}
{"text":"This is a terrible location.the restaurant was full of people holding tickets waiting for their orders.there was also a line of people waiting to order .there was an employee yelling at another.a guests should never hear this, especially when the one yelling is wrong.i wouldn't suggest this Arby's for awhile until they get it together"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for over 15 minutes for 2 fish sandwiches...... this is the first time I've had an issue here after multiple visits."}
{"text":"I will not visit your location again.  You do not honor your coupons.  There were two times I gave the register worker a coupon and they were not applied to a drive thru order.  Both times valid coupons were used, and one instance was greeted with negativity and the response that I did not need to use a coupon.  The price on the menu does not include the coupon.  I will not bring my money to your establishment if you do not honor your own advertising."}
{"text":"Great job to the whole team on the grand opening today! Everyone was very helpful and lots of smiles from the staff. The decor is really up to date and its easy to get in and out. We had a classic and King Hawaiian combo that was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this Arby's, given the 5 star rating. Now I understand the error of my ways.

Roast beef was delectable and the fries were perfectly cooked. Service was phenomenal. 5 stars"}
{"text":"I've never left a review anywhere before but after that experience here we are... the guy at the front super friendly and charismatic. However I'm assuming she was the manager was hands down the most unprofessional disrespectful women I've ever had to witness supervise other people. She was maybe late 20s early 30s in a different shirt than all the employees all black dark brown hair. I felt really bad for the employee and wanted to complain but who do you bring a concern to when that's the manager? I'm impressed you are a manager much less have a with your level of discourtesy and unprofessionalism.  To the young man up front props your great especially in that hostile environment! To the manager maybe you should consider a profession not dealing with people."}
{"text":"Had good service here today. Not sure what people are talking about. People were friendly. Got my food fast. Nice and hot. Pretty tasty. Please remember that this is fast food, this ain't fine dining!  And from that perspective, they do a pretty dang good job here. Go to the McDonalds in the hood where I live, then you'll know bad service."}
{"text":"Horrible. .. out of soda... messed up our order... employees complaining about wanting to go on break and to leave their shift.... not going back. .. :/"}
{"text":"Worst run business Ive ever seen.  The owner either needs to get hands on or sell it.  Gave this place a second chance after the first try of sitting in the drive thru for 15 minutes ended when i finally got to the order menu and they told me the system went down and couldnt take any more orders.

This time sat only 10 minutes in the drive thru ( dripping with sarcasm), only to find out after driving away, my order was filled wrong, didnt give a straw, didnt give me any arbys sauce and the wrong sandwiches were cold.  Try McDonalds across the street at least they will get your order correct in less than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I have gone to this Arby's a couple times and the last two times I have had issues when trying to use coupons. This last time, I tried to use our local Memorial HS football coupon card when going through the \"drive thru\" where you can get 10% off your purchase.  The worker said,  \"We don't accept those cards at this location. \" Of course,  I was surprised considering this is the closest Arby's to the HS (only 1/2mi down the road). She continued saying,  \"this restaurant is owned separately and we dont accept many coupons.\" So considering the food looks flattened when recieving it and as if they just threw it all together in a wrapper, I wont be going back to this location in the near future."}
{"text":"Food was good as usual but the customer service was impeccable.   Cashier Matthew was awesome!   Great service and personality.   Thanks Matt, and it was nice to meet you as well."}
{"text":"Everytime I eat at this location I end up with a sick stomach.  I don't have that problem at other Arby's.  The dining area is clean and everything else seems ok but I always get a sick stomach.  Maybe they should relook at their food prep."}
{"text":"The King's Hawaiian fish sandwich is a world class sandwich. Extra tarter sauce and added jalopenos make it even better. So when you're in the mood for a great fish sandwich, this is the place."}
{"text":"They had a good inspection score, but the food was meh. I tried the sliders and I'm over it now. Should have gone to Cookout for fast food. For a few dollars more could've had a large tea and two sides!....remember when McD, BKs, Wendy's and Arby's were great?! Eh"}
{"text":"I live a few minutes away from Arby's and I was walking to the bank when an earthquake occurred and the ground beneath me started to split. In my mind, my death was inevitable. But something happened that I did not expect. Just as I accepted my inevitable death, I felt somebody's warm calming hand grab hold of my shivering forearm. I opened my eyes to see it was an Arby's employee who's name tag read Daniel. He had a warm caring smile. I can still hear the words that he spoke, \"It's alright. I got you. Just like Arby's has got the meats.\" So I went into Arby's and bought a delicious Orange Cream shake."}
{"text":"I'm weary of this place.. I only came here since it's one of the few drive thru's that offer Pepsi products. I ordered a meal and everything went down fine... It wasn't till a few hours later that I started having stomach pains and everything came back up. I know myself well enough to know what eating bad food does to me - I feel worlds better after the fact & there was a huge time gap to know it wasn't my breakfast. This has me question the cleanliness of this establishment. Needless to say, I will never be returning..."}
{"text":"I like this Arbys. It is near my house. I like to eat inside they are fast at making your food. beef n cheddar rules. that is all."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so bad. The management is horrible and the employees are even worse, I would not work here if I was anyone reading this. I got fired because I didn't have the right shoes on and I got assumed of having a bad attitude. They take forever to make the food and to serve customers, the drive thru is the worst they hate speaking to customers. I got criticized every time I walked into that place. If you want to save money and time I recommend you go to mcdonald's or burger king for fast food."}
{"text":"Ordered pecan chicken salad. Got it ate it and thought \"that was the blandest chicken salad ever\". Just happened to look at my receipt and see it was supposed to be PECAN chicken salad; I did not have a single piece of pecan in the entire salad! I took my receipt up to the counter and the manager was standing there when the cashier asked if he could assist me. When I explained the situation the manager just turned around and started asking who made it and totally ignored me. I walked out spending almost $8 on the salad and drink with bad customer service from management. I'll never go back :("}
{"text":"Horribly mismanaged and very slow. Don't get trapped in the drive-through lane. Never enough employees, but oodles of unhappy customers."}
{"text":"This Arby's was completely empty and quiet when I stopped by. It was 11:30?
The person who attended me, was stale, not real inviting, by managed to keep it strictly business.
The dining area was as dull and drab as it could be; and considering no one was there, should have had clean tables. There was no Arby's sauce in the dispensor.
When I got my cheddar and beef combo and sat down; I looked at the poster (a plump juicy, cheddar and beef) and my order (very thin slices, little cheese, and pathetic bun). The curley fries were the size of my pinky.

Save your money on a restaurant worthy of your service."}
{"text":"We went in about 5:40pm today. There wasn't a single customer in the store and no employees were anywhere to be seen behind the counter. This included the drive thru cashier or kitchen. We waited a couple of minutes. Another customer came in. They waited about a minute. We all left together after not being served. It was as if the place was closed. If the people that own the place want to know why sales are down, you might start at actually having someone take orders."}
{"text":"Their food was okay but the place was so dirty and beyond horrible and has dust mites and breadcrumbs on the floor"}
{"text":"We stopped in while on the road trip. Excellent ~ friendly, courteous and professional ~ customer service. Management had added 
 many extra touches in the dining area that made it a very nice experience"}
{"text":"Ok its Arbys.  So you know what's up.  I usually go through the Drive-thru, since its super quick and open late.  Good food, good service.  I love those curly fries!!   Sometimes late-nite drive thru food can be risky, because places like Mcdonald's or Burger King sometmes give you stuff that's like 4hrs old! but you don't have to worry about that here!"}
{"text":"They should have 0 stars here! Let's just start with the cashier who is new she has no idea what she's ringing in at all. How do you just throw an employee on 1st day on the register with no help what so ever, what a way to set someone up to fail. 2nd, they messed up on our order. Brisket with no mayo and french dip. I got a brisket with mayo and french dip without cheese. We waited half an hour for everything. I asked for a manager, his name is Brian. He said he just transferred to this location so he has no business cards so he wrote it in a piece of paper his name, number, and 2 free combos. It's no wonder why this place is only two stars. I was so sad to watch a place that we enjoy visiting so often. Hope someone from corporate can find the time to give Brian the tools and resorces to succeed."}
{"text":"Slow service and they charge for a drink of water! Arbys has always been overpriced for what they sell and now the food is mediocre at best, at least at the Concord,  NC location. Many other better options for fast food in this area. Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"Good food....but SLOWEST service EVERRRRR!!! Their drive through wait is a joke. I'm pretty sure I could cut my own roast beef and make my own sandwich faster than they can here. Almost not worth the wait for fast food."}
{"text":"Every time we come it is over a 10 min wait to get our food. Doesn't matter that no one else is in lobby or drive thru. Half the staff is rude while the other half work. Wish there were other locations closer..."}
{"text":"Haven't had Arby's in awhile so decided to have it for lunch. Experience was average. The outside of the box container was extremely oily. The roast beef was very good though. It wasn't too salty, just the way I like it. They were really stingy with their condiments. We asked for ranch and only one was given for two people. I heard a few other customers inside complaining about the same thing. All in all, it was a mediocre experience, nothing really worth bragging about."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 French dips and a Jamoca shake on Thursday....My 15 year old daughter and I both end up puking our guts out 7 hours later.  My other daughter who didn't touch the shake didn't get sick.  I will NEVER eat here again and advise anyone in this area to go elsewhere.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you have a long time to wait, especially during lunch & dinner on the weekends. A lot of orders get messed up too, I had to catch them a couple of times from trying to give me the incorrect order. Expect to wait at least 15-20 min if you're coming here with your family. The only reason why they get 2 stars instead of 1 is because the manager at the counter is so great. He's always pretty helpful and sympathetic to the situation and makes up for the issues by offering some additional items at no cost. This place definitely needs help. The food is good though."}
{"text":"Making my way to Saint Louis, MO and exited the 218 to use the restroom here. We pulled up here to use the restrooms and the door was locked. Staff noticed us outside and came to open the door.  

Let me just say, the restrooms were spotless, so thankful for that! I know they just opened but I can't believe how clean it was.  Spacious, fully equipped with a baby station and a chair if you walk in with a child. 

Ordered the smokehouse brisket sandwich with cheese and BBQ sauce, for a fast food place, my tastebuds are pleasantly surprised. I haven't had Arby's in forever but loved it!

 Staff was super friendly, very welcoming. Would come here again."}
{"text":"Today was my first day back at the office after the holidays and I needed a treat for lunch.  So, what anybody in their right mind does in this situation...I decided to head to my all-time favorite establishment-Arby's!

Let me tell you about the flavor explosion that I was able to negotiate for surprisingly under $7.00:

1.  My Chicken/bacon/Swiss sandwich was exactly as described and advertised .   The deep fried crunchy patty melted on my tongue as the yellow gloopy sauce they use was just enough to cool the pallet.  But wait, what was that extra crunch?  Was it....bacon?!?!  You bet it was!  Bacon gave the sandwich enough zing to meld with the protein and gourmet bun so even the elitists would zeal at this modern day masterpiece creation.  Chef Gordon Ramsey would be proud.

2.  Crispity crunchity Curley fried potato dreams!  Ooooohh, the secret blend of spices and oils used for this treat can never be matched.  I have a repeated calling for the taste and aroma of these treats and today did not disappoint!

3.  Zero calorie lemonade.  Of course it's a new year and like everyone, I'm on a diet.  What a better way to have a guilt free meal than to wash it down with this tasty beverage.  The best part is you can serve yourself in your own paper cup!  Next time I will bring a brown bag and wrap it around my cup so I look cool like any self respecting Clevelander would.

Lastly, I was a little sad about the plating as they put it in a paper bag for me to take back to the office.  I was able to unpack it though and build a secret castle with my fries and used the sandwich as the gun turret temporarily."}
{"text":"This chain review is brought to you by the \"proximity to 300\" clause.

My husband had a medical procedure performed this summer which required him to be knocked out with narcotics. It took him a bit to regain clarity, but we had to be on our way well before he was lucid enough to drive.

He hadnt eaten anything all day prior to the procedure. The nurse said I should take him to get something to eat. The conversation went something like this:

Me: What do you wanna eat?
Him: mmmmm..?
Me: FOOD. What do you want?
Him: (Stares off into space)
Me: Well?
Him: Jamocha....Shake.

So off to Arby's we went. (He also got a \"grossed beef\" sandwich with cheese and some curly fries. But he enjoyed the shake most of all.) Keep in mind that we had never been to Arby's together before,and have never been since. 

I guess when you're doped up on painkillers, sometimes the only thing that can really make you feel okay is a Jamocha shake."}
{"text":"I like eating here but the prices are just too high.  Long gone are the days of 3 for $5 beef n cheddars and 4 for $5 roast beef sandwiches.  I only eat here now with a coupon.  My favorite being buy 1 get 1 free chicken sanwiches.  The food is good here.  The dining area is clean.  I haven't had a long wait yet.  I have been eyeing their cookies but haven't had one yet.  Arby's is good for one or two people.  Any more than that, you should probably just cook at home."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever experienced at an Arby's. Maybe they were having a bad day?




Food was still good. Mountain Dew sucked though."}
{"text":"Excellent and fast service. Came in after 5.30 and still was fast. Food was fresh and place was very clean. They were very friendly and for once I didn't feel like I was bothering the employees Like other fast food places. It was great to see the employees having fun while working. Exactly what I want to see when I come to a place to eat. Not annoyed people or rude people. And even got an enthusiastic goodbye have a good day. So A+ Arby's Great pick on employees."}
{"text":"I really like Arby's but I can't recommend this location.  Took the family for lunch this week and when we walked in we immediately lost our appetite.  The smell was so overpower of 'airport latrine' that we lost our appetites.  We moved from the front area to see if it was any better in the dining room and then we were confronted with crazy bad carpet smell.  I guess stick to the drive thru if you want to still have an appetite for Arby's at this location."}
{"text":"I know... it's arby's - do we really need a yelp review?   The food is about what you would expect... but the staff here!   They were just so nice.   It's busy at lunchtime on a Thursday, probably peak time,  but everyone was just so polite and kind."}
{"text":"The furnishings were clean & updated. Had greasy smell when walked in door, but I expect that from fast food establishment. Everything we ordered was exceptionally fresh. The bread was fresh, staff sliced the roast beef fresh. The cooking area appears clean and the staff was friendly. I'm glad we stopped in. $15 for two to eat (drank water) and one yummy Salty Caramel shake. 
Almost didnt stop in because of last review. And, they play American country music if anyone is interested (im not fond of it, but it is different for Phoenix, AZ)."}
{"text":"when I got there today, no service at the drive through... I waited and someone speaks Spanish to me on the microphone,,! I am American! they couldn't understand enough English to take my order so I drove off.."}
{"text":"My husband and I hadn't been to an Arby's in decades, but did a takeout for a picnic a couple of weeks ago. Thought it was fairly good. However today ordered a takeout and were very disappointed. Husbands roast beef sandwich was fine. I ordered a turkey and Swiss wrap on a pita with no mayo. What I got was a very small amount of turkey, even less Swiss, a quarter size piece of unripe tomato, a tiny dot of onion on some unknown bread with no mustard. Basically a lettuce and bread sandwich. Service was extremely slow. I'm being kind when I say the D team was at 12:30 pm today. If we should give them another chance, I will insist on seeing the order before I leave. The owner and manager should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"Surprised I am the first reviewer... or am I surprised...? I rarely see people at this location.

Which is surprising because of all of the Arby's locations I'd say it is the best by far. Great service, quick and polite. The food is always piping hot and very fresh/tasty.

I'd definitely recommend to check this place out and order anything, it's all good."}
{"text":"Terrible service and undercooked chicken.  

Was ordering for 10 people and asked for 9 chicken sandwiches and 2 Beef sandwiches..  as I oulled up to the window to pay the drive through employee looked at me and said \"are you sure you want 9 chicken sandwiches?\"  I told him why wouldn't I , I have a can full of people.   He looked very confused.  After waiting 20 min in parking lot to have food brought to us we drove off because we were in a rush and learned the beef sandwiches were not put in the bag.    2 people who bit into the chicken found theirs chewy like rubber and cold.   

I called to explain the situation since I couldn't return immediately, and was met with rude customer service again as if it was my fault.   I just hung up when I realized I was speaking to deaf ears.  

60 bucks down the drain."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else. Long wait at the drive thru. After they take your order. They make you pull up and make you wait for a long time for your order.  Like I said. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"About the best you can expect from a fast food restaurant. I had to grab a quick dinner here with a couple co-workers before heading to a work function. It was clean, the food was good for fast food, and the staff was friendly and quick. Let me pre-solve a mystery for you, though - the straws are hidden in a cutout in the walls on the opposite side of the counter from the drink lids. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I just needed a quick stop to grab a bite between errands and they were way under staffed. The employees were nice and apologetic, but the manager needs to get hiring. Waiting 30 minutes for a couple sandwiches is unacceptable for a \"fast food\" chain."}
{"text":"Parking lot of doom! Getting in and out is a PITA! You literally drive over a curb to enter. The whole lot is uneven and bumpy and turning into the drive through can be a struggle if you have a wide turning radius. Foods always fresh though!"}
{"text":"Five star reviews. Wow. It's definitely a step up from the one that used to be around the corner. Food is considerably more expensive than Mcdonalds. Much cleaner than Mcdonalds bit the floor was sticky. The one manager was telling the kid to mop the floor and make sure he gets the sticky messes on the floor from where the trash was. Leads me to believe the floor wasn't mopped last night. I came in on a Dundas afternoon so that's kind of gross.

Got a roast beef slider. Comes with cheese on it. That plus horsey sauce costs you about a buck fiddy. Tasted good. Steelers on the tv. Oh all the employees were very friendly."}
{"text":"I ate there the other night on my way home from work. I got the French Dip Combo. Not only did it make me sick, but when I went home, all I did was watch a porno and go to sleep exhausted. I normally manage to stay up at least 4 or 5 hours after I get home from work. It was horrible.

The service the other night was good. This skinny ginger with freckles was super nice. But several other times, I've gone in there and received awful service. 

I have about 5-10 minutes between when my bus drops me off and when my bus picks me up and I have either McDonalds or Arbys to choose from for a quick bite to eat before work. I was in one line waiting for about 4 minutes for the counter girl who was slow. The manager then opens up a second line and the lady behind me steps up to make her order. I say \"Hey, I've been waiting her longer than she has.\" And the manager told me \"Your cashier will be with you shortly.\" I wasn't going to wait around so I took off. That was the last time I went to that Arbys before work.

After Tuesday's experience, its going to be the last time I go after work, too. I like the variety of Arbys but they're much more expensive than McDonalds and I've had too many bad experiences both with the food and the service."}
{"text":"Well....I'm sitting here and the lady running the front is screaming at everyone in the back. It is stressful to listen to. Not an enjoyable experience. She needs to calm down."}
{"text":"I'm here sitting right now and I'm just dumbfounded by all the screaming and hollering by the ghetto crew members behind the counter. You can everything. Foods overpriced. Like I said getto hood rats run this place."}
{"text":"I'm so upset by what I just experienced here today. They were obviously very very busy. They had a brand new guy at the cashier counter inside all by himself. He was very very nice and kept apologizing for the wait. He was very polite and kept a smile on his face. There was a lady with light reddish blonde hair who was running around everywhere like a chicken with her head cut off. She kept coming up to him frustrated and telling him why didn't you do this that or the other thing. He would give a very reasonable answer and she was just throw her arms up and yell at him in front of us (made me very uncomfortable). He would apologize to her and say he would remember for next time. When they yelled out what I thought was my order since my receipt didn't have my order number on it, I walked up to inquire. I said I think this might be my order and tried to show her my receipt. She completely ignored it and said okay this is your order. I said but there is no fries... She told me \"he didn't ring you up for fries.\" I tried to explain to her that he did and that it came with the meal that I had ordered and that I even watched him press the button for them. Before I could explain that he did and did a good job she was like \"WHAT SIZE!\" I was baffled and couldn't get out what size in the time she wanted and she yelled it again \"WHAT SIZE!\" Seemingly very annoyed. I said medium and she picked up a cup of them and threw them on the platter. She was so rude to me and was so rude to all of her employees. Other customers in my general area were commenting on how rude she was to the young man behind the counter and just in general. She shouldn't be training anyone. I've worked in fast food and if your don't have the composure to handle the big rushes then you shouldn't be a manager. Absolutely horrible. I guess the food was good at least."}
{"text":"I just had the roast turkey Farmhouse salad and I thought it was great!!  It's simple.  Lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese and pepper bacon.  I have my suspicions that the pepper bacon is what made this salad but I will try to ignore that.  The ranch dressing is made by Mazettis and that helps too.  On the web site it claims to only have 230 calories in the Farmhouse salad.  I am sure that is without the salad dressing but who cares!!!"}
{"text":"Why they need to take down the to Arby's listings on East Tropicana and South Maryland Parkway they are both closed down"}
{"text":"This location is right down the street from my job which is convenient, but what's not is the fact that I have to wait AT LEAST 15min every time I'm in their drive-thru, even if there's just one other car in front of me. The service is always so slow, and it's definitely a deal breaker for someone who is on their lunch break."}
{"text":"Very outdone with their chicken pecan sandwich. It was mostly bread than anything else."}
{"text":"Hit the drive through at 12:15 PM today. I was surprised that I didnt have to wait long and was no line either!  I am a fan of their sliders baby!   This happened to be the one time I didn't check the bag and pulled out after getting what I thought was my complete order.. and of course my order was incorrect.  oh but I had the receipt - which was helpful so I turned around (chapped of course) and went back now BUT the drive thru line was long... I wasn't about to wait now.. I was all ready late.. so I went inside.  There was nobody waiting to be waited on which was great but funny there was about 15 people behind that counter!!  How on earth do you get a small simple order wrong with that many people working?  So the young woman who waited on me - I gave her the receipt told her the issue and without even a change of expression (no apologizes) she fixed the order.   It was clear this happens all the time.  Thumbs down to this Arby's location."}
{"text":"Going through drive thru, cashier is the rudest ever. Enough for me not to come back. Been coming for for years. Not anymore.."}
{"text":"Today I ordered the side chopped salad.  What exactly is a chopped salad?  I presume it is a salad that is chopped.  What I got was a regular salad with regular iceberg lettuce that needed to be cut up before I could eat it.  I do not consider that a chopped salad but apparently that is what a chopped salad is to Arby's.  I am not basing my latest update solely on their non-chopped salad that they call a chopped salad.  Also, on that non-chopped salad were rotten tomatoes & rusty lettuce.  So I had a non-chopped, rotten tomato with rusty lettuce salad.  Doesn't that sound awful??  I threw it away."}
{"text":"I am not wild about fast food but I do eat it.  I wonder, is Arby's a healthier alternative to other fast food places?  I really doubt it.  This Arbys is better than the one on Neil in my opinion.  

I have been hearing their new commercials about the sliced turkey.  I have tried the The turkey classic, the Grand turkey club and the three cheese and bacon.  I like the turkey club the best.  But once you put bacon on something I think that puts it on the unhealthy side.  This sandwich has 490 calories but a whooping 1440 sodium.  It comes on a harvest wheat roll with turkey, bacon, tomatoes, Swiss cheese, lettuce & mayo and it is good.  The three cheese has Swiss, shredded cheddar, pepper bacon & a Parmesan peppercorn ranch sauce.  I did not care for ti much.  The sauce did not taste right and it needed some vegetables on it.

One of my all time favorite sandwiches is the Super Arby.  It's a simple sandwich with Arby's roast beef, lettuce tomato & french dressing.  I consider it my \"go to\" sandwich when I am in hurry and can't decide on anything else;."}
{"text":"I'm a Arby's fan, but I dont eat there much. When your roast beef has a rainbow it not fresh. Also I typically like eating at busy locations since the food rotates more often. Went to this location several times I love the Ruben but the last two times I got an attitude from the workers and my bread was wet and soggy. A slapped together sandwich. I loved this place and wish they set higher standards for their food and employees."}
{"text":"Its an Arbys,  but then not all locations are equal.  This one did job at maintaing a better then average  level of quality and service for las vegas locations."}
{"text":"Desire argued my order with me and kept saying its all there when I was checking to make sure as she was trying to rush me thru the drive thru and I was missing 2meals instead of apologizing, after I showed her the recipient, she said her name is Desire and to call the # on the recipient"}
{"text":"I have given up on this Arby's location. I keep going there multiple times because it's right near my work but almost every time they screw something up. First time they wouldn't take my card I kept telling them you need to slide it the chip does not work they refuse to slide it. The next time I ordered their brisket sandwich all it was was brisket in between two pieces of bread there was no sauce no onions no nothing did it said it's supposed to have on it. Then tonight I went there another time I ordered a medium mint chocolate chip shake you know what they gave me mint ice cream in a small cup they did not put it through their shake machine there was not a single chocolate chip in there there was no whipped cream and it was the wrong size. I had to complain to the guy at the drive-thru and ask to speak to the manager before they agree to fix it. The other two times they refused to fix it flat out. I give them some credit for trying to fix it this time  but one time out of 3 is not a good ratio I keep going here because it's close to work but you know what I've given up I'm not going to go there anymore because every time I do they fucking screw something up. And only rarely rarely do they admit they're wrong and fix it. It's just not worth it. They can't do their jobs right and thus they shouldn't have them at all"}
{"text":"I just witnessed the manager yell at a lady because her child was in a wheelchair. I'm never going to Arby's again."}
{"text":"What separates this Arby's from the rest is the employees here.  They are all super friendly.  They always smile and look like they actually enjoy working there which is nice.

Arby's has great roast beef, what can I say?  Get yourself a giant roast beef sandwich and load it up with Horsey sauce.

Overall this is a good restaurant.  They are friendly and it is clean.

I go here a lot!"}
{"text":"The staff are always amazing!  The food is traditional Arby's.....the restrooms and eating area are always immaculate!   Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"I wish I would have gotten her name but the cashier went above and beyond for an elderly gentleman that was in line just after me.  he appeared to be a little confused and pretty  slow, the time she took with him without getting upset and frustrated was memorable and a perfect example how we should all treat one another.  He was ordering a few different sandwiches and then at end he was questioning why so much, she was confused and proceeded to go over the order and amounts, that is when he said he didn't want all that just a brisket sandwich.  Without so mush as a roll of her eyes, she deleted everything except the brisket.  I will try to stop back in when I am back in the area so I can get her name and give her the recognition she deserves.  Now as for the food everything was fantastic and i LOVED the fish!  Not greasy at all and very tasty! I will definitely know where to come now when I want fish!"}
{"text":"The map location is wrong.   It's north Durango Dr not south Durango Dr.  It is mapped on the wrong end of town."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Went through drive through. As in pulling away I grab my slider take a bite and make eye contact with this guy (large bug) . I did not ask for \"extra protein\" - gross"}
{"text":"Husband and I love Arby's although it's far from home, but this time was even better with the service and attention we got from an employee. Thanks so much for brightening up our day Elliott!!!!"}
{"text":"I really thought the customer experience with Bianca was outstanding.  She was very professional and patient as we placed our confusing order.  She got the order right. =)

I really enjoyed the food today and it was served in a prompt time. 

The restaurant was very clean and quite.  

I had a very positive experience here today."}
{"text":"The most polite and well mannered cashier \"Guy\" food was less then but great but his upbeat attitude and manners made our lunch. I can not tell you how nice it is to have someone greet you. Vegas is not known for this."}
{"text":"This place has turned to crap over the last couple months. I use to go there for a sandwich regularly when I didn't feel like eating much or cooking because of its close proximity....the staff has become ghetto. There are a couple lingerers there still but even the managers I've seen (especially the pot-bellied dirty white man in his 20's/30's) are a-holes.  

If you don't want to be  overly nice, just don't be! Just don't be blatantly fake with your interactions with your customers. Its clear these folks are on a downward spiral. I wouldn't trust the food safety at this point."}
{"text":"I'm not a regular fast food eater, but after a day of shopping I needed a quick fix and the kids needed a bathroom. When I walked in there was trash on tables and the bathroom was out of paper towels. We ordered a few roast beef sandwiches and I had a ham and swiss. The food was fresh and the staff was friendly enough, but I couldn't get past the condition the restaurant was in and we took our food to go. If i decide on a return visit I'll opt for the drive-thru."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to Arby's, but every time I eat here I get sick. It hasn't been just me either. I know multiple people who have gotten sick from eating at Arby's. Which saddens me because it still tastes pretty good, just not like it use to."}
{"text":"I hadn't been back to this Arby's for a long time because of the slow service, but I had a craving for a Market Fresh sandwich. I was very pleasantly surprised by the efficient and quick service! Much improved!"}
{"text":"Got the new brisket sandwich, which was pretty good.  Nice smokey flavor to the meat.  I gave Arby's 3 stars because of the employees.  Apparently the manager doesnt care about the noise and playung around the employees make.  Granted it was a little slow but the employees were playing grab ass and really really loud, laughing and such.  You would figure a manager woyld stop this but no they continued the whole time I was eating my sandwich.  Grab a broom and a rag I am sure there is some cleaning thats needs to be comoleted before the end if your shift."}
{"text":"My grams and I have been coming here since I was a very young girl. She likes sharing this Arby's with me when she is on this side of town. When I was little a woman named Penny worked here and she we always so polite. Now as an adult people come and go. Today my grams heard someone ask for a senior discount right after she ordered and paid. They were granted the discount. She asked if it was too late if she could get one and they told her yes it was too late. That is very disappointing. When I worked in food service we would have gladly refunded and then redid the order with the senior discount applied."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, very confused workers gave me the wrong order numerous times. They have also charged me for things I didn't get."}
{"text":"Excellent fast and accurate service.   Much better than the Arby's in Pineville , that you should avoid like the plague ."}
{"text":"Worst Arby's in the planet.   Waited 15 minutes for food, when asked were it was \"coming right out they said\".   Another 10 minutes later I asked for a refund and the manager was very rude and never even offered an apology.   There were only two orders ahead of me, utterly ridiculous .   Left and went to the Arby's on S tryon and had the same order in 60 seconds."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years.   Never again. We went last evening and it was FILTHY. Roaches and bugs all over the counter. ALL OVER IT. Over a dozen.  Some little kid playing with boxes of condiments, guy working there completely ignored us. But the bug situation was awful. Health inspector need to pay a visit soon"}
{"text":"Food typical for Arby's. Decently friendly staff. 

Bathroom was disgusting like it hadn't been cleaned in a month. Outdoor area could've been awesome but they never clean it or at least it seems."}
{"text":"I must say... Arby's is one if the only \"fast food\" joints I go to and my favorite. I live within two blocks. HOWEVER. EVERY time I've been to this location, it's the WORST Arby's experience ever. I get the sand thing every time. Ultimate blt market fresh meal with curly fries and tea. Seems easy, right? Not so easy. Every time I've come here (again it's within one minute) I'm disappointed. Either tiny bacon bits instead of bacon strips, minimal bacon, or tonight !!!!! They had the nerve to serve my market fresh blt sandwich on a regular bun with roast beef. Roast beef!!!! I understand it was probably a new girl, but come on!!!! I didn't even eat it. My boyfriends onion rings were so hard they were worse than a Funyun, but not as tasty. I guess I may have to drive next door to jack in the box instead and risk the gut rot the next day. I believe it will be worth it."}
{"text":"This Arby's is conveniently located near the corner of Woodlawn and South Boulevard, so I stop occasionally on the way home when I've had to work late. However, rarely have I been here that there are not several homeless people begging for money in the parking lot, and several times I've been approached inside. The manager seemed to not be bothered by the solicitation going on in the establishment. Also, all winter long, when I've come here late in the evening, the place is like an ice box. Evidently they are too cheap to heat the place for their customers. Bring a heavy coat if you want to eat inside! I spoke to the manager, and was told there was nothing he could do. Plenty of other places to eat, good bye Arby's."}
{"text":"We have been staying at Motel waiting for home to be finished. The male with blonde long hair, I believe a manager is always super nice. Wonderful customer service skills."}
{"text":"I normally don't stop at Arby's too often but I was craving curly fries!! I live only 3 miles from this location and when I got home my fries were cold. Not even lukewarm just completely cold. Now I know to check before I leave. The only reason I gave this location 2 stars was because the woman at the window (my receipt says Jamie) was super nice!"}
{"text":"This Arby's is absolutely trash! I showed up at 9:10pm when their hours are posted til 10pm when they close. I get there and all the lights are off and one car at the window, there is a female employee there. I sit st the drive through for 5 minutes shouting \"hello!?\" With no response. I pull forward and the vehicle is still at the window with the employee standing right there. I will NEVER return to this pathetic excuse of a restaurant"}
{"text":"I have to say that I wold have given this place a 2 star rating before, but now I have to change that. 
About two weeks ago my girlfriend & I went through the drive through of Arby's to get 2 roast beef sandwiches & a large fries.. 
The PA system must have been screwy that day or the person inside had his volume turned way down (for whatever reason they do that!). So there we are yelling at the guy, almost screaming at the top of our lungs, the both of us. I am instantly annoyed by this because I cared not to scream since I had been sick from my throat that day. This only made it worse. 
Then we get to the window, pay and drive a few feet only to find that we were missing a whole roast beef sandwich. I backed up, and tried to get the employees attention, but the place looked deserted. 
We drive around, get off, and walk into the restaurant. Turns out we weren't even charged for the second one. I also notice that the fries were stone cold. The person who helped us at the drive through take the fries, dumps them, and gets more out of the exact same bin of cold fries from before. My girlfriend by this time is irate. She asks for a fresh batch of fries so that they won't be the same temperature as the previous ones. 
We get new ones & we leave. 

We don't go there for 2 weeks. This time we walk in and pay for our stuff and eat there for a change. The service was way better, food temperature, 100 times better, and there is noting missing from our order. The guy who helped us the previous time even remembered us and apologized for the last time we were there. He offered to give us a shake or something else from the dessert menu, but we were so satisfied we said that wouldn't be necessary and we were fine. This Arby's is A-Okay in my book.  We forgot to suggest that they replace the PA system or adjust the volume for their end.  Next time.

As usual the Roast Beef Sandwiches were top notch."}
{"text":"It's 11pm and I'm exhausted after a double shift.  It was great to stop in the drive thru and get great service! I can't remember the gentleman's name,  but he's awesome! I had a pretty big order but it was all good. And you can tell he really enjoys his job.  I'll definitely stop in again! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff. After insulting us about our food choices, they tried to throw on a tax for us to dine in even though we never said we were going to. Simple inquiries were greeted with death stares. The food was old and tasted like it had been under lights for the entire day. All of the employees looked like they were having the worst days of their lives. No emotion from anybody. This location honestly just feels dead. It is also in dire need of a remodel. When you walk in it feels like you just went back in time to 1950. I won't be back to this location. There are plenty of other Arby's and fast food places elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Staff is not friendly at all, Not once never smiled it shocks me to see every single employee be like this. Espically being my first time to Arby's in Medina."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place doesn't have better reviews. I find myself here a lot. It's never that busy, the place is clean, and the food is delicious. I'm not a fast food person, but Arby's is one place I'll go to. So much better than other fast food out there!"}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru ever... just for 2 shakes. Seriously unbelievable my shake is probably melted by now. And I'm sitting in their drive thru right now... still waiting. As I'm taking 5 minutes to write this.."}
{"text":"I ordered a French dip meal. The curly fries were so hard I could not bite into them. The woman who was at the drive thru window was a very unhappy person. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The inside was pretty dreary and outdated, as far as fast food goes I suppose. But for what it's worth, you're not really coming to Arby's looking for a fine dining experience. The food was solid, consistent, and was done in ample time. Employees were cordial, overall not a bad experience. But also nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Awesome service at this location each time I come in. It's a treat as this is the closest Arby's and its over an hour away."}
{"text":"Food was greasy and gross, couldn't eat the grease-soaked potato cakes, sandwich had dry bread and hardly any beef-the employees don't seem to care, this place blows!"}
{"text":"I just wanna say this Arby's SUCKS!! My Texas Toast brisket sandwich wasn't toasted  the meat cold the fries cold the onion rings cold I didn't get the the shoestring onions it didn't look anything like the picture. I will not go back to this Arby's ever"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. We asked the 'cashier' about the new Bourbon Steak sandwich, specifically if the meat was tender (we could not see the picture so had no idea how the meat was presented).  She repeatedly ask what, with a feigned perplexed look on her face. She did not understand 'TENDER'   Playing dumb and not understanding or speaking the ENGLISH LANGUAGE while working with the public in THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is totally unacceptable. 
She then went to ask the good preparer, came back with the answer, 'No'. I replied, 'No, what? No, it's not tender?\"  She agreed. 
I voiced that I could not understand serving a meat saying it wasn't tender. My friend decided to order it and said if not good, we could take it back. I pointed to a man behind the counter stating he was probably the manager (older). Then little young Miss 'I don't understand what you are saying' spoke in reasonable English now, 'I AM the manager'.  I swear that I did not laugh out loud, but did proclaim my disbelief that she was the the manger and didn't know about the foods products of her store.  
Missy became irate, called me rude and stated she wasn't going to talk to me anymore. I think I then did laugh verifying that she wasn't  going to talk to me anymore, at which she repeated her statement again, and again. I then logically explained to her that is she didn't want to speak to me anymore, then she must not want my business.   That was more than missy could comprehend. She then retrieved 'the man' exclaiming various non-understandable comments, after which 'the man', now known as the assistant manager came to politely take my order.  
Aren't there kind, intelligent, respectful people looking for jobs, so that we, the paying public, do not have to put up with hired help such as this 'too young and inexperienced to be a manager' person? Who trained her? Who even thought that she would be manager material?  What appropriate person doesn't have a job because this missy has it?  
The assistant manager was, by far, a more viable candidate for the position. 

I am waiting out the evening hoping I do not become ill, from possible food tampering retaliation."}
{"text":"The best way to describe this Arby's is dead. The food is dead. The staff is dead. And, it's decor is dead. The food was lukewarm and tasted like it had been sitting for a while. The staff wasn't very welcoming. They lacked ant vigor until carrying on conversation amongst each other. The decor was dated and had a dirty feel. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Jan 8, 2018, bit into the top of a condiment package in my fish sandwich. It had to have come from the trash. I'll never eat at any Arby's again ... ever."}
{"text":"This is one of the worse customer service fast food place ever!!!!!!! I ordered 4 items and a drink.   Didn't hand me my drink and shut the window.    When I got home 1 item were missing after u reminded him (big belly guy).  Find another location!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This review isn't for food quality or service in general. This review is for an act of shadiness by the person working drive-thru on 11/29/15 at approx. 1pm. I've visited this Arby's drive-thru before within the last two weeks and have spent about $10-$15 that last time, used my credit card and never had to sign for it. This time, they handed me a slip that had no signature line on it and stated \"Signature not Required\". I let the person know and they said \"Your bank doesn't require it, but it's company policy to sign.\" As I've stated there is nowhere to sign on this slip that looked like a normal receipt. Needless to say I will be eyeballing my account for weeks to come for fraudulent charges."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!! No ice in drinks, missing my sliders, young girl that took our order seemed like she hated her job!!! Thank god we're just passing through."}
{"text":"VERY disappointing! Arby's finally offered a sandwich we loved, The French Dip,at a fair price, 2 for $5. Went to order today and the price for 2 sandwiches was DOUBLE!  Are they INSANE??? 
Still will buy at 2 for $5, but doubling the price in this economy could be the end of Arby's.
Fast food just does not get it. People are not buying drinks and just getting water which COSTS them money. Their bottom line would increase if they offered their drinks,any size, for just a dollar, like McDonalds. This company must have IDIOTS in their marketing department."}
{"text":"Sorry to say but this location closed recently.  I just moved to Fountain Hills and was excited to have an Arby's close to me now.  But no longer.  What a bummer."}
{"text":"It's okay, nothing fancy.  Restaurant was super clean and everyone that works there are super friendly.  I only go there when there's coupons and special promotions as their regular prices are kinda expensive for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Amazing 
Clean, even the bathroom clean! Friendly not snotty like most fast food places. Courteous and quick service! Food was prepared correctly !"}
{"text":"Visit this location several times before.
Food was fresh, prepared quickly. Service was friendly and helpful.
Dinning room...all the tables were dirty.
Food better than the normal burger chain so understand the slightly higher price.
Will come back"}
{"text":"Hardly  go to Arby's ..Ordered thru drive thru  tried the Ang 3 Chz meal. Service good up sold meal . Sandwich was very tasty but the roll is very dry and curly fries was very good n Hot .!!!

Recommend to shop for different roll or maybe it's just rotation or over ordering . 
There are many Bakery that will deliver fresh daily like Great Buns ..
Thanks"}
{"text":"Cold fries, warm iced tea, and I waited for almost 10 minutes to order my food and another 10 minutes for them to get my order together.. Staff stood around looking like they didn't know what they were doing.."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice.  First time I waited forever in the drive thru for a mini $1.49 sandwich.   Second time I went we went inside and once again waited longer than usual for fast food.  There was someone complaining about a sandwich to a disinterested manager.  I felt the staff was not well trained when asking questions about different sandwiches and when they asked the manager he seems bothered.  I do not intend to return to this location."}
{"text":"I get coupons in the mail for Arby's so I like eating here when I have those. Some sort of deal is usually going on like 2 for $5 or 2 for $6 on the more popular sandwiches. I saw a new \"snack 'n save\" menu where certain menu items like jr bacon cheddar melt, mighty minis, jalapeno bites and several other things that all ranged from $1 - $2.99. I like the reuben w/o kraut when it is on special but usually order between the beef n cheddar with a sesame seed bun or the French dip and swiss. No matter what I order I always ask for a side of au jus to dip my sandwich in and it is killer good. My wife loves the arbys sauce but I think it is so nasty. Just give me the roast beef and some liquid cheese and some au jus and I'm good. this location has a drive thru and the employees are always nice. The inside is clean and roomy."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. The only thing I find odd about this fast food restaurant is they make you sign the receipt when using a debit card?!?! The receipt even says no signature required. By the way they don't check your ID to match the debit/credit card but make you sign the receipt. This is obviously a clueless manager or owner who thinks signing a \"no signature required receipt\" protects them some way...while not checking ID with the use of credit/debit cards is not protecting them or their customers. Get with the times Arbys on Flamingo."}
{"text":"I went to Arby's for there latest special. Two for six. I wanted to tried there latest item on the menu, the \"Loaded Curly Fries\". I don't like ranch dressing so I asked the cashier if I could have it without it and she said sure. She rang it up, the shift manager knew about the special order, and it was also on my receipt. I got my meal and what to my surprise? Ranch Dressing on the fries. Everyone knew about except the lady filling out the order. I take it she don't fully read the orders. It is not the fault of the cashier or the shift manager it is the lady filling the orders. I did get my money back for the mess up but they lost a customer. To bad the lady filling the orders make more work for everyone else."}
{"text":"This Arby's has never been just your average fast food place. Going to CSU across the street, I was here a lot and every time I was there the staff always went above and beyond by offering extra sauces or a cup for water. They were always smiling and would strike up a conversation for small talk."}
{"text":"It's f****** Arby's! What's there to say about it. It's roast beef or it's not this is food to put in your stomach. Better than McDonald's or any other fast food joint. What is fast food so what are you really want for it. Not a whole lot to say for the place except again it's better than McDonald's but not really better than Wendy's. LOL"}
{"text":"We have the meats! I have always enjoyed Arby's, my friend and I would go there in our high school days. Curly fries and beef n cheddar sandwiches were the best. I recently tried their Reuben sandwich and I really enjoyed it. Look for coupons in the ads."}
{"text":"Food could not have possibly tasted worse. It was fine from a perspective that it was warm, no bugs, clean, etc. It just tasted so absolutely terrible that I questioned my decisions as whole after I chose to eat here. I've eaten at Arby's plenty of times when I was a teen. Now that I'm in my early twenties this is the first time I have been back and they have sacrificed the taste for what I assume are cheap, fake, disgusting tasting ingredients. I wouldn't eat here if I was starving."}
{"text":"We stopped in to Arby's (Charlotte)on our way to VA. Thank you Mr.  Gregory Williams for  good food and great service. We appreciate your hospitality."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for a fast food restaurant.  Make sure you bring coupons to use.  They have a big neon sign out front so it's very easy to spot.  Never a fan with drive-thru service because I don't know if they really put what you order in the bag, I always have to double check everything.  If you dine-in and really enjoy their service, there's a bell by the door that you can ring, pretty neat."}
{"text":"Wow. I REALLY wanted to like going back here, but after the last 3 visits, the food was so terrible. Dry & stale sandwich buns are unacceptable. Sorry."}
{"text":"No one tought them how to make shakes or use a register. Took 3 people to take my order and complete the transaction."}
{"text":"We are huge Arby's lovers and used to go to the one on Boulder. We went to this one and were very surprised at how TERRIBLE the customer service was from Miles. If you come and see the name tag say, Miles. TURN AROUND. Go spend your money somewhere else. We were deciding on something and he kept saying, \"Your total is $10.81.\" As my husband and I were speaking to each other about if we should add another curly fry. He said it about 4 times as he is doing the \"hand it over\" hand signal with his hand trying to hurry us and get my husband to give his credit card to him. Like excuse me? Hang on, we're trying to discuss something very quickly. Keep in mind there was NO ONE in line behind us. I am very courteous and would have stepped out of line if there was even 1 guest behind us, but there wasn't. VERY RUDE. I will NOT be returning unless he no longer works there. MANAGEMENT PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. Here some photos of the location and our order..."}
{"text":"Numerous visits to this location and have never been disappointed. Friendly and fast service. Tried the new bacon Bly. Guys in the gym were raving about this sandwich. Couldn't believe how much bacon was included between two buns. It was good but a little sweet for my taste. Will always go back b"}
{"text":"Decent service and food is about par with other Arby's - either you like it or you don't.  I liked their curly fries."}
{"text":"June3Today I went to Arby's to get a Buffalo Chicken Slider to try out, and as I was getting my food. My radiator explodes, shutting off my car, I panicked, and was truly grateful for what followed. The staff at this Arby's location offer to help push my car out off the way to a parking spot. They saw me struggle to figure out my situation, and offered to help me in any way they could. I specifically remember Cathy (Sorry if I spelled your name wrong), she helped me figure out the problem, her and other staff helped me put water in my car. Her and all the amazing staff gave me great advice. I made it home, and no tow truck necessary! The staff was amazing and so helpful. I'll never forget these Great Samaritans, and will be coming back soon. Thank you for the help, and the Buffalo Chicken Sliders are delicious!"}
{"text":"This is our second time at Arby's for the King's Hawaiian sandwiches, we typically don't frequent Arby's very often but these sandwiches have brought us back twice in a month which is unheard of. 

The service was okay, the food was good, the fries were hot. Would I drive across town for Arby's? No, but just down the street is fine with me. 

4 stars because this happens to be a location with competent staff, fresh curly fries, and a soda machine that was well stocked. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Floor outside Men's Room was wet and I slipped, nearly falling. Told this to Katrina the manager who responded with a totally uncaring, dismissive, and even suspicious attitude. Didn't tell anyone to clean up. 

Sliders are tasty, though...."}
{"text":"I'm not very picky when it comes to fast food places . I love Arby's roast beef and today I stopped in to get a sandwich to go, the girl at the counter was not looking at me but something behind me. I don't know if it was the people or staring out into space but she did not say hello she just stood there waiting for me to speak. I ordered my sandwich paid for it, she asked my name, I told her, when the sandwich came out, a young man came up called my name smiled and said have a nice day, the gal who served me put some kind of flyer into my bag, as I was walking out I pulled it out and noticed it said something about inspiring a smile. I thought it was funny since she basically didn't even acknowledge me if it weren't for the kid handing me my food I would have basically been just a number. 
If you want to know about customer service actually have some to offer."}
{"text":"They gave me disgusting fries. I'm very disappointed. I was looking forward to a nice hot sandwich, curly fries, and a drink --- by I couldn't even eat the fries. I called the restaurant 3 times with no answer. I'm going to keep calling. Hopefully they can replace my fries. 

My advice to you: Ask for fresh fries."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I stopped in for a quick lunch Saturday and was pleasantly surprised by the food and service from this location.

We walked in and the place was pretty empty but very clean. We were immediately greeted by Christina who ended up taking our order and giving excellent customer service.

We were starving and a lot of the newer items on the menu seemed very tempting! Christina went over several items and we settled on the turkey bacon and ranch wrap, fish sandwich and regular roast beef sandwich.

We waited because they had to prepare everything after we order, but I don't mind waiting for hot food! And Christina brought everything out to us and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal. 

My friend let me try some of her wrap. It was delicious the ranch dressing has a bit of a kick and it comes with a good amount of turkey, lettuce and tomatoes. 

I ordered the fish sandwich was really good, crispy on the outside pretty good with a little ketchup and lettuce. I love the seasoned fries, especially when they are hot and fresh! 

I didn't try the roast beef, but from what my friend said it was pretty delicious! 

I was pleasantly surprised with how the service was at this location. And hot food is always a winner in my book. So I'm sure to stop in again!"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours. Really, it's pretty much the only place still open on this side of town after the bars close -- which happens to also be the only time that Arby's tastes good."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff with a fairly clean place. One of my go to places for bad for you food. Not over the top or anything but really juicy. Curley fries are addictive. I really really really wish they would bring back a milk shake called the \"black cow\" root beer flavored. Soo good,  I still remember it like it was yesterday."}
{"text":"Worst Arby's I've been to, staff always out by the drive through smoking and chatting with friends, then act put out when you ask them to make a sandwich."}
{"text":"My family and I always come to this Arby's and we always leave happy! But, unfortunately today, that wasn't the case. The food was great but the guy who took my order at the drive thru was really rude! I had coupons that I received in the mail and asked if I should just read them to him or pull up to the window and hand them to him and before I could finish, he cut me off and said \"No. Just read them to me.\" With a bit of a tone but I just ignored it. He then told me that I can only use 3 coupons at a time (I had 4) so I asked if I can do 2 separate orders and he took a long breath and said \"suuuree\". I then pull up and the girl in the background was asking what was my order again, which they mixed up at first, so I asked if they wanted to see the coupons and he again, cut me off and said \"no. I've seen way too many of those today.\" with a nasty tone. He then handed me my bag and I was simply checking it and he said \"If you're going to check it, then move forward because you're making my time run.\" A simple please would have been better but this experience was just overall horrible! I really hope he doesn't treat anybody else like that because it wasn't very nice!"}
{"text":"It would be more stars except for portion size! Still delish! Had the new brisket meal (with a coupon of course) delish!"}
{"text":"Arrived at CLE to stay at Hampton Inn. Noticed this Arby's across the street. It was 10:30p so I checked the website to see if they were still open and the site said they were open until midnight. I walked over and found only the drive thru was open. I called to ask if I could order a to go through the drive thru, they said no. I asked if I could pay cash for a to go order at the door and they said no. I asked if there was anything I could do and they said try back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Great team.    Staff very friendly.   Food delish!   Love the cherry turnover and gyros.  Staff goes out of way to make customer feel safe important.  Restaurant ver clean."}
{"text":"Good service and polite staff.  The sliders were killer.  Forgot my sauces for my chicken fingers. How is a man supposed to cope with chicken fingers with no sauce.  It was very tough but I preserved! There is always next time"}
{"text":"I recently moved about 5 minutes from this location, and Arby's is my fast food of choice when I don't feel like cooking. Unfortunately, my experience was less than pleasant today. I had been in the car for 12 hours on my way home from a vacation and stopped to grab something to eat before I got home. My buffalo chicken slider came almost totally plain. My side of cheddar sauce for my fries came a fourth of the way full. Not what I expect from you Arby's, and not worth my money."}
{"text":"This place has definitely been cleaned up since its bad reviews a few years back. The seating area was neat and clean, my order came out super quickly, and it met my expectations (I mean, it's cheap fast food).

To push it up to a 5-star review, they need to work with their employees about customer service: smile, greet the customers, look like I'm not bothering you by wanting to order! The cashier just stood behind the counter not saying anything to me, so I wasn't sure if she was ready to take my order or what. Her friend was also visiting with her at the counter, and that was clearly of more interest to the cashier than my order. Finally, I just went up to the counter and just said my order out loud which she eventually took down. My roast beef was pretty good, I just wish it had been warmer; it had clearly been sitting under the heat lamp for a while.

Basically, you get what you pay for, people!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this Arby's location for years. I think this restaurant has the best dining experience of any fast food restaurant I have ever seen. It is always clean and the atmosphere is enjoyable. It's multilevel seating, live plants and high ceilings make it stand out from other restaurants. The Arby's roast beef and jamocha shakes are welcomed old favorites. They also have new menu items that are worth trying and could become classics as well. Their staff is always friendly and excellent. I can't believe this store isn't busier than it is. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 gyros with no onions (wasn't sure if they had any on them) and extra sauce. Get home, no sauce at all. Well, that teaches me to go to a fast food place. I blame myself as much as them. 1 star for me too."}
{"text":"I was there last week where the door to the inside restaurant was just locked. I don't remember the name of the guy that allowed me to order through the drive thru as I was on foot just getting off the bus and going home. ( I live near by). But I wanted a rueben, and I got my rueben. Great caring customer service!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a little Arbys. Their window is probably one of the slowest around... but who cares. Are you really needing your food in 3 seconds?

Nah...

PS - I dream about the loaded potato bites!"}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at this Arby's. The staff are polite and the food is hot. My order is always correct. I have been going to this location on and off for the past two years."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru ever! How hard is it to get four items right? First time I came here the cashier run me up for an extra mozzarella and didn't put any ranch in the bag like I asked for. Didn't realize it until I got home! Second time I came here, I had to repeat my order because she added items on I didn't even say!"}
{"text":"Super, super, nice, friendly, and apologetic staff for the long wait. I just think they are under staffed for one reason or another, and have been for the past couple years I have been coming here. Gyros are great, so that is why I wait, but the manager/owner needs to get their you know what together, because I don't have time to wait this long, and will think twice before stopping by again. This time the drive thru was so busy when I pulled up, I decided to go inside because I thought it would be faster. Nope! I don't frequent fast food often, but will look for a different option next time. Too bad, the staff that helped me was amazing, and offered me a free drink or turnover, other...maybe I will come back, the lady was so nice. The third star is just for the awesome lady at the register, who worked to keep me engaged, and kept the energy up with her team. If she is the manager, she could use some support from her boss/owner. It's a grind, give your people the support they need to make your Arby's great!"}
{"text":"Too SLOW! Drive thru is a pain, if I didn't Love the Fajita Spicy Flatbread, I would just go across the street to KFC. Good Food, Very Slow service :("}
{"text":"I love sandwiches! They so tasty and good. I usually get extra turkey extra lettuce. This last time bad experience with customer service. They really mixed up order and said they would fix but I not been back yet."}
{"text":"Just don't bother going here. Honestly. 
Terrible customer service. 
The gentleman Trayvon can't hardly speak up and almost seems incompetent. 

Walked in and stood there for 5 minutes while two employees made eye contact and did not even stutter out a single word, but continued to slouch off. Literally surprised that I got rang out at all"}
{"text":"There is a coupon for Arbys roasted classic 3 for $5, limited to 5 orders. Cashier agreed with the coupon and my daughter wanted the 5 orders which is 15 sandwiches for 20 bucks for the b day party for the kids. Manager stepped in and said no, limit my daughter just 9. Wow!!! Six kids no Arby, how sad, Bad Manager."}
{"text":"Place is a mess Very bad service tryed to pay cash&card girl said we don't do that its 1 or the other"}
{"text":"This place needs to be shut down!! They served me blood on a chicken slifer and when i called to complain the manager gave me the run around.. So i spoke to the DM ruth and same thing .  then spok to the owner jay johnson and he dont seem to care..... Beware"}
{"text":"Today the were having problems at this Arby's.  We've been there when the service was so good that we rang the bell 2 times on the way out. But not today.

We were the only people in the restaurant, and they had 5 or 6 lined up at the drive-through. They decided to help those people first, which annoyed us, because we were inside waiting for our food.  

We think possibly they have a new man \"cooking\" because he kept making mistakes and the ladies in the front had to wait for him. They were loud about it, too, even complaining about not being able to multi-task.

Will we go back? Probably. It's convenient and usually it's fast.  The food stays with us for a few hours and the iced tea is great! The shakes aren't thick enough for our liking, and they come out of machine that way so there's no control by the staff."}
{"text":"It should not take 25 minutes in the drive-through with only one car ahead of you. The sandwich did not look anything like the pictures. A total fail"}
{"text":"Yeah yeah this is just a fast food place but hey, it's one in a million that a fast food place offer such great service! 

The inside was very clean and there is a ton of tables to pick from. All the employees were friendly and they made us feel welcomed. 

First Arby's I've ever been to where the employees look happy to be working there. Definitely will return when in the area."}
{"text":"I'd rather drive to c3 or castle Shannon to hit the drive threw. Fast food isn't fast when u have to walk in. Desperately needs a remodel."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place a three just because the food is good but the customer service I just received was not all that great the girl is talking to you like she doesn't want to be there or having a bad day. But your in customer service you have to be cheery when it comes to customers at least that's my point of view. And I have been to this place before this is my 4th or 5th time here and never had a problem with customer service. I just think the girl has to work on her Attitude."}
{"text":"My order was $10.23. Give the guy $15. He hands me back the $5 and tells me to come up with 23¢. I asked if he didn't have changed and he just gave me a confused look. Ok?... Also, did you guys run out of sauerkraut for the Rubens? Just give a person a heads up. (PS- I know I'm being ridiculous writing a yelp review on a fast food restaurant but \"come up with 23¢\" is aggressive lol. Really? It was like 845p and what's your deal bro."}
{"text":"Don't go here...Had food poisoning last night from eating their food. Cashier can't take orders properly and there's a bum next to the entrance. Those I can understand, but getting me sick from the actual purchase I made...Can't forgive that.

Wish I can give Zero Stars."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at this place today. She even offered me a water cup for while I waited on my food. Everyone was so nice! Love it!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff. Random craving for arbys and really wanted a shake. The machine was down and the guy was so sorry he insisted I chose a turn over for free.  Great customer service from all the staff"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! More specifically the service from Keith. He displayed a very professional and attentive service. He made the experience above expectation."}
{"text":"Olivia the store manager went above and beyond to accommodate my potato request! This is my Arby's now because of her exceptional customer service and smile!"}
{"text":"Well this location is CLOSED. Guess it could not survive in a ritzy area. Too bad, we will probably get a giant frozen yogurt stand now or a Culver's or In and Out would be nice actually. Stay tuned"}
{"text":"The staff @ the Brunswick Arby's are so very nice. They really go out if there way to help someone out and really seem to like working @ Arby's!

I ring the \"Yelp\" bell for you. Thank you for the pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"The service here gets worse every time.

We stop for fast food about once a month, usually when we are in a rush to be somewhere. Arby's has recently become my \"go to\" fast food spot, on account of the selection. Honestly, most of the sandwiches I get do not feel like fast food.

On this stop, it occurred to me that, every time we come to this Arby's (about once every 2 months), something happens that leaves us sitting in the car for 5+ minutes waiting for our food. They may as well close the drive through option at that point. While I do not expect the attendants to be the standard of professionalism, they do some ignorant things, like take the money before mentioning the \"5-8 minute wait\" and rush me while ordering. Also, be aware that the speaker box faces Durango, so it can be difficult to hear clearly, even when the attendant does attempt to speak properly. 

On this particular stop, the wait ended with a bag stuffed with napkins, 2 fresh sandwiches and rock hard, cold fries... I imagine that even your typical stoner drive through attendant would think the heat up some fresh fries after initiating the unexplained waiting period.

Do not stop at this Arby's if you want to be in and out or if you want a constantly prepared meal. We have not eaten inside, but I would guess that the tables are sticky and none of the salt shakers are full."}
{"text":"I thought the staff were fun (We shared a volley of 3 jokes with each other,) and the sandwiches were a'ight. I got a grand turkey, but had some sammich jealousy for my bro who got a Reuben sandwich. curly fries were a win. (of course.)"}
{"text":"Well, I placed my order at the drive through speaker.
Drove to the window.  A car in front of me had pulled up, presumably waiting for their order.
No one ever came to the window to greet me.  I saw one person walk by.
After several minutes I drove out past the person still waiting for her order
  As I looked back,.still no one at the window!"}
{"text":"Our service in the drive thru last night was the best customer service I've ever received in any drive thru window!! The employee was very friendly!
Our food was really good which consisted of a turkey bacon sandwich and the curly fries tasted fresh!"}
{"text":"Frustrated after sitting idle for 10 minutes at drive thru, i parked and went in. At least 8 people were standing around waiting for their orders to cone up. I walked right up to place my order but waited while other 8 to be filled before getting mine. Ridiculous!!!! It's 2:00 in the afternoon not lunch or dinner hour! I don't know if this is a common situation here but if it is I won't wait again!"}
{"text":"Drive Thru was a little slow.  Chips instead of fries sounded interesting, as did a Boylans Ginger Ale in a bottle instead of the same old same old.  All in all it was OK."}
{"text":"There's usually no wait here. Nice place to stop and grab some good Roast Beef Sandwiches! Tonight I'm trying out the number 12. Roast Beef, Bacon, and Cheddar!! Curly fries as always..."}
{"text":"so disappointed. The service was so slow. They couldn't get our order right and gave us the wrong order. We ask for beef n cheedar and got beef and the bun. :-( Also the manager was so rude amd threatened her employee that if they couldn't make order right that she'll be sending them home. I won't be coming back for a very long time."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Terrible drive through microphone. Terrible very long wait. Terrible value/portion. Terrible prices: 10 bucks for a fast food meal!???? All around terrible. I will not return to this location. I miss Rax."}
{"text":"The girl at the counter was friendly and she got our order right. 
The place is clean but dated. Which seems to be changing as they have signs up warning about some contruction work.
I have gone to this location many times as it is super close toy home. I have never had the experience the last reviewer had. 
This is a food chain I feel bad for as they never seem to be very busy. But the food is different and good. Not just a McDonald's clone"}
{"text":"So, I really don't like complaining, but, only having two people run the joint in the early evening is definitely not enough. My husband and I first attempted to go through the drive though and after a few minutes, we weren't even sure if the place was open so we pulled around to try to go inside. By the time we parked, someone else was already in the drive through being helped. It was slightly annoying but still laughable at this point. When we went inside, we quietly waited for the guy in front of us to finish his order. However, as soon as he was done, they told us to wait and started helping all of the drive through customers. Either we have extremely bad luck or they definitely need to get their act together and hire more people. They made up for at least two stars by being friendly when they finally helped us and giving us fresh, hot fries. I don't think we'll ever have time to come to this location again."}
{"text":"What I like best about this location are the friendly people that work there. Very clean inside and out. Good location, good food served quickly with a smile. And they take gift cards :)"}
{"text":"So bummed this restaurant is closing. I've been to Arby's all over the valley and this one is by far the best. Staff is always super nice and the food is really fresh. The food is better here than half of the \"nice\" restaurants I go to. Bummer"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches even without sauce.. service has always been friendly and when the order came out wrong recently, I was handed the correct order with a sincere apology. Fast food restaurants rarely have staff who care enough to even offer an insincere apology, much less one that is sincere.. kudos!"}
{"text":"Screw you Arbys. I'm done with you for good. Your slow service, frequent order mistakes & best of all, your stupid clipboard receipt holder that I have to sign every time I don't use cash. How the fuck did this shitty chain get enough money to bye Buffalo Wild Wings? A cool happening establishment. You know they're gonna fuck that up as well. Whoever BWW's competition is gotta be laughing their ass off about now. Arbys? Really"}
{"text":"The absolute worst Arbys. They shorted me 2 deluxe sandwhiches and when i called after driving 10 minutes home. The manager pretended not speak english. Not worth driving back over there. Stay away!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the kindest staff and quick good service.  They saw me coming with a stroller and rushed to get the door, very kind and friendly!"}
{"text":"I went to this Arby's for lunch today, and there was a problem with my order. It was moderately busy, though not packed. I placed an order at 11:50am, and sat down waiting for my name to be called. After 25 minutes, it never was. I went back to the counter and spoke with Tom (Management team member), I could see right away he was sorry and apologized. He immediately re-entered my order and asked if I would like a turnover on the house, which I declined. When he gave me my order, he had placed the original $10.40 charge back on the tray, again appologized and said \"Please have this lunch on us\". Wow! Accidents happen, no business is perfect. I wasn't asking for a free lunch but that's exactly what I got. That's customer service perfected. I will definately go back the next time \"I'm thinking Arby's\"!"}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is great. Kate the manager was very helpful and considerate. My smoke mountain sandwich was delicious, and the curly fries were hot . This Arbys does look like a funeral home tho."}
{"text":"The Arby's at Whitehall Commons is better than the average Arby's location in decor and presentation; it is one of the few I know where all employees where white dress shirts.  The location is clean, with stations not messy and tables typically cleaned in a timely manner.

The food though is typical for an Arby's; the quality is no different from this one with any other location.  I typically never have an issue with orders at the front or drive-thru areas.  They also accept coupons that locals receive in mailers.  

Overall, it's an okay location, though I believe that people never plan to go to Arby's, they just happen to go on a whim.  Whatever the case may be, it should be alright."}
{"text":"About 18 years ago I worked at Arby's and quickly climbed the ranks to assistant manager. I worked with a dedicated, goal oriented crew who strived to meet company values. We always had a clean restaurant, kitchen, dining room, even the parking lot. Above all customer service was the number one priority.

What I have seen at this location is not what Arby's corporate would like to see. Filthy restaurant, the drink station specifically is disgusting, the floor is always sticky and gross, and the staff really don't give a shit.

I've seen buns that are not toasted fully, wrappers not folded correctly, wilted lettuce, and just sandwiches slopped together.

Y'all either need to fire the manager or just replace the entire staff."}
{"text":"Bad  service and dirty  tables and  esting area.    Wil not come back  lazy workers.    Tht woud.  Not fly at my store and im a manger"}
{"text":"You can expect most fast food restaurants to be predictable, however I've received incorrect orders on more than one occasion. Food is always Arby's-esque, and I would venture to say it's good for what can be expected form Arby's. Staff is generally friendly and drive through service is prompt."}
{"text":"I love the burgers because they are tasty and very different than every other fast food joint; however they are SO darn expensive.  It cost me 10 bucks to get a good sized burger combo which is insane.  I can get a much cheaper meal at an actual resturant.  I also really love the Arby's sauce and always have.  I wish I could bottle it up and take it home.  Does Arby's sell this stuff in stores because I would consider buying some?  Anyways, food is great, prices are too high...that's about all you need to know."}
{"text":"Been in the drive through line 20 minutes now. Not one employee has apologized. There there was 1 car ahead of me with a small bag and I'm still waiting on my food."}
{"text":"Ok, the brisket is out and the new Smoked Chicken sandwich has arrived to many commercials during sporting events. It really is a decent sandwich for a fast food place. The white meat chicken is clearly smoky and the sandwich is enhanced with gouda cheese, crispy onions and a bakery style bun. At about 5 bucks, it is a good option if you want a change from normal fast food, but as usual it is limited time only. Oh yeah, the mozzarella sticks here are also the best fast food sticks available."}
{"text":"This is a 5 star for fast food. I was never an Arby's hater, but not a lover either, until recently.  I love some of their sandwiches. Particularly the ones that are not roast beef, such as their turkey and triple thick bacon, and their loaded and smoked Italian.  If you haven't been to Arby's in a while and think they are just roast beef and you aren't crazy about their roast beef, then I recommend that you give one or more of their other sandwiches a try."}
{"text":"Ate at this Arby's on Sunday 7/06.  They were so focused on taking care of the drive through that it took them 30 minutes to prepare our simple order to eat in their dining room.  When we finally received the sandwiches they tasted like they were made 30 minutes earlier and left under a heat lamp.  They were a little above room temperature.  The fries were hot but over cooked.  We asked for our money back and left."}
{"text":"This place is long gone, but this review is long over due. 

Absolutely nothing stands out on this menu. Are you craving a 2 pound roast beef sandwich covered in cheese whiz? If so, just save yourself the money and eat straight from your green composting bins. 

I read a review that \"quality varies\", and after having been to different Arby's throughout the States (I apparently hate my digestive system), it's apparent that quality does not exist in these stores. 

So in closing, I'm not a fan of Arby's."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly slow both times I have been there.  We visited yesterday evening through the drive thru.  There were not very many visitors inside.

Judging by the sheer volume of the employees, it's no wonder the service is slow.  They were loud and rambunctious.  Maybe they should put that effort into serving their customers.

My husband asked twice for horsey sauce, and still had to end up going inside afterwards for some as they put none in the bag.

After he asked for some inside, the young man waiting on us mocked my husband to his coworkers as my husband left.

Very unprofessional.  Will not be visiting ever again.  I suggest you don't either."}
{"text":"\"Where the Beef ?\"
Drove 6.8 miles to get an internet promotion, thats open to anyone who walks in 
Deception!
The worst is you get a sandwich not like the promotion picture ; but a salad in a pita with bits of meat 
I showed the girl she went to another person in the back and came sorry gave me another sandwich 
Still little bits of lamb"}
{"text":"My wife and I split a beef and cheddar that did us in something fierce. We ate around 8pm and the stomach pains started around 2am. I was awakened by the pain of my butthole being burned by the escaping fumes of your caustic cheese fermenting inside my gut. That's about the time my wife woke up. She was in so much pain she tried to army crawl to the bathroom, sensing she was in trouble I grabbed her ankles and wheel barrowed her to the guest bathroom as fast as I could with a flambe'd cheerio . I then turned for the master bathroom where I spent most the night. I curled around the toilet on the nice cool linoleum floor and sucked on a wet wipe for sustenance. I tried going to work this morning but puked and got sent home. You owe me a work day and 2 new buttholes."}
{"text":"Stickler for customer service. Food was average. It's fast food. Pretty much tastes the same everywhere. Clogs your arteries same everywhere as well. But the one thing these establishments can do individually is customer service. And though it's not terrible here, it certainly is far from a five star rating."}
{"text":"Consistently clean restaurant, fast service, and of course great food. I am a regular at this location. Not enough good things to be said about this place."}
{"text":"I did drive through . The staff were polite and nice. The service was quick. I ordered a turkey ranch bacon sandwich. Didn't look at the order before I left, my bad. I received a roast beef something. I HATE roast beef, but being already home just had to dispose of it. The curly fries were good."}
{"text":"So I'm not a big Arby's fan to begin with, but they are OK in a pinch.   Went to order a bunch of sandwiches and the kid asked if we had a coupon.   We didn't but he mentioned it so I asked if we could get it.  He said he would get in trouble with his manager so we asked for the manager.   The manager came out and we explained we were told there was a coupon and asked if we could get it.   He said not without the coupon with an attitude.   I don't know what kind of customer service Arby's is supposed to have, but this manager has no idea about customer service.   Any other place will give you the coupon if they mention they have one.   So here is the idea, if you're not going to give the coupon out, then don't mention it.   Either that or just give it to everyone."}
{"text":"One of the better Arby's franchises. Always clean, friendly staff and food is fresh, hot, and fried things are nice a crispy. 

Arby's original is always my go-to and beef n cheddar is a close second. Love Arby's sauce and their horsey sauce. Apple turnovers!  Seasoned curly fries, Fried jalapeño poppers with buckelberry sauce!  I always get too many sides when I go here. 

Recently had the venison and it was surprisingly good!  I hope they bring it back next year!  

I only wish Arby's would bring back the Arby-q!"}
{"text":"Went there this morning thru drive thru I ordered 4 classic beef and cheddars I get home and there 4 classic roast beef sandwiches. Then they said that I needed to bring in the receipt & sandwiches, but they never gave me a receipt. They said bring everything back including the receipt and they would take care of us . I told them I only have 30 minutes for lunch and I don't have time to run and take it back . I won't be going back anytime soon ."}
{"text":"Had a free meal coupon and used it on the new limited time only Pepperoni mozzarella buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich. This was surprisingly tasty fast food. It contained about 6 very large circles of pepperoni and a thinner than the commercial slice of fresh mozzarella. The chicken was lightly covered in good marinara and was all white meat with no fat involved. The exterior was crunchy, but then it was of a soft bite through the chicken.. Free was better, but only $6.99 for meal."}
{"text":"This Arby's is ridiculous, there was no car in drive thru, nor anyone inside the restaurant. Yet the floors have food and marks all on them.  The tables had crumbs, ketchup dispenser broken and all over the counter. Certain sodas being out. Plus the manager came in from outside and went straight to the back to start dropping fries and helping with orders before washing her hands. I can guarantee that I will not come back to this location. Should have went to in n out instead!"}
{"text":"Been eating at Arbys 4 many years.Last 3 experiences have left me in amazement. In a bad way.

Normally, I don't waste time reviewing fast food.Its Fast food after all.

Ive got no issues w/prices going up. But I do have a problem w/horrible customer service added in with prices that have gone thru the roof, w/food that is subpar at best.

OK 1st, A month or so ago I had a coupon for 2 gryos for $6. Also saw the commercial saying the same that exact day.Even checked their website& it was there.But, I called 1st. The girl who answered put me on hold as she asked her manager if this deal was still available. She came back & said 'yes, it is'.

Upon arrival, in rush hour traffic, pressed for time, with hungry kids& adults, all waiting on me & Im told 'we no longer have this deal'...

I asked for the manager & got the asst manager, the highest available there at that time. Explained the above in detail.He could care less. Literally, no matter what I said, he didnt care. In a hurry w/others waiting on me & now knowing I will have to make another stop to grab a couple pizzas for others, I ordered 2 sandwiches for myself (admittedly, they were fair..Ive had worse, but still nothing gr8. For the $10, I would have been happy with a couple of burgers from almost anywhere).Left, stopped & got 2 pizzas. 

Completely unsatisfied at the asst managers lack of customer service, the fact I spent $10 for 2 sandwiches for myself that were ok, but at $10, I could have gotten 2 MONSTER burgers/sandwiches elsewhere. &then wasting more time to stop & grab 2 pizzas for another $25, I was not happy.

I contacted corporate with my complaints. I received a voice mail from the Manger, Dawn XXXX. Her Voice Mail stated that she was sorry for the issue I encountered, apologized for the asst manager on duty not doing his job properly & then told me if I come back in the next week & ask for her, she would honor the 2 for $6 Gyro's (I was going to get 5 of them originally.The ad, commercial, website all said I could do 5---10 gyros- $30+I would have been buying drinks/fries etc in addition..they even confirmed this when I called).

I did not even bother to call her back to take her up on her 'generous offer', cough, gurgle.

Really? All that and her offer was simply to 'allow me' (I guess im privileged to be allowed!) to get what they should have honored ASAP. I ended up spending $10 right then & their for 2 sandwiches, which again, were ok, but were more on par with competitors dollar/value menu stuff.They were not even close to being $4/$5 each sandwiches. 

So, her Voice Mail offering me such wonderful compensation, was honestly a slap in the face. I dont spend my life scamming fast food places for free food. But her 'offer' was an insult to be honest, so I decided to not call...not take her up on such a generous offer and forget it &take my families biz elsewhere where its appreciated. 

Its fast food....stuff happens.....I know that, accept it and rarely ever complain when it comes to fast food.Yet prior to this fiasco, my previous order a week earlier was not a good experience. 4pm. Thankfully the order was small...only for me..But, to keep it short, it was laughable. 2 Classic Roast Beef Sandwiches, drink & 1 French fry. Over $11& as stated earlier, I know & accept prices go up. Thats life. No problem. But the Classic RB's used to be a lot cheaper & actually had a fair amount of meat on them. These were twice the price & half the meat.& loving their fries, I know what to expect..A fair portion..not huge, but fair.I should have taken a picture then, of both sandwiches & the fries, with my receipt..But I didnt.

Ok, so im done w/arby's after the last 2 experiences.No problem, plenty of places willing to take my families $/business.

But yes, there is a problem. My kids (& yep, myself as well admittedly), luv arby's Curly Fries. My kids & I agree, best fries of any fast food place. As the adult, I was willing to send a clear message to arby's that they lost me & my family as regular customers...I can find good fries I am happy with elsewhere while sending a message that they lost my biz due to awful customer service (that offer from Dawn, the manager of 'allowing me to come in the next week & she will honor the gyro deal', was literally an insult) & that while I accept higher pricing, I still expect a halfway decent product, but do not insult me.

Normally, the 3rd time is the charm.2 Awful experiences in a row (again, its fast food so acceptable to a point), only 1 of which I brought to their attention only to be insulted as stated.

Kid wanted arbys chick tenders& fries. I relented. Got a 1/2lb french dip for me & chick tenders& fries 4him. I've never taken a pic of food. I did this time. Chick tenders were 3 measly pieces of batter.Fries wouldnt fill up a bird.The 1/2lb Fr.Dip, laughable. Look at the pics!Pics dont lie.They speak loudly! If U work for arbys, look at the pics & dont question why u lost a regular customer. Pathetic."}
{"text":"The worst service. Living up to the first part of her name. And no napkins; this is my biggest pet peeve with drive throughs. No common sense!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place but they have let their quality slip. My family has experienced stale bread on their sandwiches. I have had stale buns on my roast beef more times than I want to count. Their potato cakes are not good anymore. I didn't even enjoy the curly fries which I got this time. Even the roast beef isn't as good anymore. I guess I'm done with this place for a while."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hotel next door and this was the closest meal option. Im not a fast food fan but their turkey and Swiss sandwich was tasty and fairly healthy. The ingredients were very fresh. The assistant manager took my order and she was very kind as was the other worker. Super fast service as well. I took it to go as it is in a truck stop and does have a different type of vibe as the previous reviewer mentioned. Not a big deal tho. Typical truck stop."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch and while that's exactly what I got, there were 'issues.'  In my struggle to find healthy food on the go, I ordered a turkey wrap and soda.  The turkey was actually frozen. I assume they must make them ahead of time? I have no idea, but the end result was a VERY COLD wrap.  Also, they filled the soda cup so full of ice I couldn't even get a straw inside.  Serious.  I had to pull the lid off and sip diet pepsi...the 4-5oz that actually made it in the cup."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Customer service use improvement.  The staff did not seem happy."}
{"text":"I actually don't mind the Arby's chain; I certainly don't go to one on a regular basis, but when I do I usually enjoy the treat that is a so-not-good-for-me fast food type of sandwich and a side of curly fries. Usually what I get from an Arby's is an a-ok fast food variety sandwich that, while greasy, is still very tasty and doesn't leave me feeling sick to my stomach.

That said, I never truly enjoy the food I pick up from this particular Arby's. Firstly, often when I've placed an order in their drive-thru I've found that I've had to sit and wait for my \"fast food\" for 10 to 15 minutes. After waiting for my food - on the days that I didn't leave the line in frustration before placing an order at all because I couldn't even do so in a reasonable amount of time - I've found that what I've gotten has been mediocre compared to what I've experienced at other Arby's. Common issues I've come across include the lack of sauces when I've asked for them, overcooked food, and so much grease that the sandwich begins coming apart, AND after eating I begin to feel sick to my stomach.
 
Sorry, guys. I may not expect a lot from a fast food joint, but this Arby's just doesn't impress me."}
{"text":"Jamocha Shakes are usually five-star amazing! However the one that my daughter got this time was just okay. It didn't have enough of the Jamocha coffee-chocolate flavors. Our whipped cream was a little sad looking but we did like the drizzle of chocolate syrup. 

I won't give up on Jamocha shakes. I might try this Arby's again. Maybe it was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Jamocha shakes and curly fries, yes! Driving home with a van full of kids, we decided to get a snack and got these delicious snacks from the drive-through. 3 small Jamocha shakes, 1 small vanilla shake, one tall specialty orange cream shake and 2 large curly fries rang up under $20. 4 hungry kids and one hungry mom made short work of it all."}
{"text":"Jamocha shakes, yeah! Our family was hungry and looking for something fast but a little different. We turned into this Arby's off Peoria. I knew we were going to get Jamocha shakes, but we also picked up 2 crispy chicken clubs. The bacon was lovely and the chicken was crispy and flavored acceptably. My son enjoyed his chicken cordon bleu very much. Of course, we devoured our deliciously seasoned fries. Although the bill was pricier than other fast food joints, we enjoyed our meal. Jamoch shakes are still 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Clean dining room and bathrooms.  Food was fresh and hot. Man who took our order suggested some of his new favorites on the menu and let us know about the happy hour specials. While we went with a classic roast beef and beef and cheddar with curly fries everything was made fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"Listen it was 11:01 coming from a concert up the road. (Not knowing you were closing) next time please say we're closed everything was wrong tasted like crap and totally rude employee! 
Just want to let you know also your sprite machine was just soda water! As you slammed the window shut in my face!"}
{"text":"Recently tried their new gyros, seriously good for fast food, been back 3 times in past 10 days. Took a break from Arby's for a while as it was getting too expensive and boring, this has been a nice change though and brought me back. Potato cakes are tasty."}
{"text":"Came here tonight and was very pleased with my service. I feel bad for fast food employees because people never notice good service since they are only there a minute, but are outraged when something goes wrong. I got my food fast and the girls at the window were nice and pleasant. Without asking for it, one girl said she threw in some bronco berry sauce for my jalapeño poppers and said to let her know how it is. It was good, thanks!"}
{"text":"After a long day of fishing with my dog, i got extremely hungry. We drove around looking for places that were open. I gave up and asked Siri what was open and it led me here... i have to say... $13 down the drain. I know that it's fast food and not a five star restaurant. But... there are some things you do and some things you don't. I ordered some new sandwich. I forget the name of it though, sadly i couldn't stomach it. I open the sandwich to see what was even inside of it and low and behold... BANG! 
Guess what i found.. THE CHEESE WRAPPER WAS STILL ON THE DAMN CHEESE!!! 
I do not know how that went unnoticed?? I could understand if it was busy but i was literally the only car there! I got grossed out because if they didn't notice that, God only knows what else they do. I will not be back. 


AVOID THIS ARBYS"}
{"text":"Yari is the rudest little girl I have ever met. I will not return to the restaurant until this girl is fired.  Refused to take my order. Turned away a paying customer. Great Manager, turn down $ and get blown up for horrible attitude and service.  My best friend owns a fast food place. This type of attitude would never be acceptable."}
{"text":"I love how clean it is. Burger King, McDonalds and Chick Fil A need to take notes. The guy at the counter was so nice and sweet. He was a big black guy but I didn't catch his name. I felt welcome and the hospitality of those who work there and also the one next to Target in Midtown will keep me coming back"}
{"text":"This is not my usual Arby's. When we came it it was busy. It is in these moments that the staff can really shine and that was definitely the case tonight."}
{"text":"Great Arby's location. Food is good, staff is friendly, and the dining room is clean... what more can you ask."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero I would.  I have always loved Arby's since I was a little girl.  This last experience at this Arby's turned my stomach.  I got my usual Arby's roast beef combo with poppers.  Poppers were cold, which really didn't bother me,  What turned my stomach was when I opened my soda lid and saw slug and crap in the bottom of my cup.  My husband called the manager and explained what had happen.  The manager said he would send out coupons for me to re-visit, (I could use at another Arby's if I was to disgusted to re-visit the one on 7 th st.)  never received any coupons in the mail.   Arby's has just gone down hill.  To bad, only fast food I ever ate."}
{"text":"I would agree with Jacob as well since Arby's is reliable, tasty and has different items than other FF places.   Ah, they have tasty Roast Beef along with those curly fries / Arby sauce (also like the Chicken CordonBlue)."}
{"text":"Arby's is my favorite cheat meal, usually. Yesterday I ordered my usual- beef and cheddar mid. The guy that took my order was very nice, completely different from the girl that did not say a single word to me the whole time I was at the window. I said hi, handed her my money, she handed me my food, I said thank you, and didn't even get a smile or head nod. Then I open my sandwich and didn't see any cheese or Arby's sauce like usual so I open it up to find a quarter size dab of cheese in the middle and a single small ring of Arby's sauce. My one sandwich was 5.40 and that was what I got? Won't be back to that location."}
{"text":"Your mozzarella sticks are without peer. 
As is your jalapeño poppers bathed in the blood of broncoberry.
When I leave this mortal coil I wish to have a giant onion roll fashioned into my casket.
Better yet please give me a Viking funeral into a river of Arby's sauce.

You have unlocked a poetry in my black heart.

I could go on but I fear pushing you away with how I truly feel.

(I know you feel it too though)"}
{"text":"Kinda pricier than other Arby's I have been too. The lady here is really nice and has been here since 1988!!! Good food, clean restaurant, clean bathrooms, nice people, can't complain! Yum yum Arby's!"}
{"text":"Arby's is a lot different from your traditional fast food restaurant. You won't find any burgers on the menu. What you will find are roast beef sandwiches, potato cakes and apple turnovers. My favorite thing on the menu is the Beef n' Cheddar. It is Arby's roast beef piled on top of a warm onion bun with hot cheese sauce and red ranch, which is kind of like a sweet ketchup. If you have never had one, do yourself a favor and try this sandwich. My last visit, they had 2 french dip sandwiches for $6, so I got that and had one for lunch and took the other home for dinner. 

This location is cute, they have these cute wooden benches as seats at some of the tables. The staff are always friendly and my food comes out quickly. I have yet to receive anything wrong with my orders. You can tell they take the time to check and make sure everything is correct, whether you are dining in or hitting the drive thru.

Yelp 2015 Review #22"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch destinations. The food is just as good (and frequently better) than any other fast food place and the service is always great. A couple of the ladies behind the counter even remember our names."}
{"text":"That was by far the worst sandwich I've ever paid for and tried to eat. The Bourbon brisket sandwich was way too salty and dry. Horrible. I'm toilet ready. I feel dirty for spending $8+ on this disgusting value meal. Thank goodness the potato cakes were decent and they couldn't screw up the small bottle water I paid $1.50 for (why?) which I totally don't understand. Never going to another Arby's again. No wonder this place is going under. Sucks."}
{"text":"Suuuuuuuper!! Slow!! No fast food restaurant runs efficiently as a Chic-fil-a and that includes this Arby's. Such a shame to wait 20+ minutes for 2 roast beef sandwiches and a fry. Last time here."}
{"text":"Yuck. I've been an arby's fan for a long time, but this particular arby's is bad. Curly fries were mushy, stale and cold. Chicken sandwich was soggy and microwaved. Servers were unprofessional and yelling at each other. Just won't go back here again"}
{"text":"F#%k yeah Arby's!  This is a really clean one and pretty fast service - great for a quick fix before or between matches at Pinburgh at Replay F/X this past weekend.  Hurray!"}
{"text":"For a \"bus stop fast food\" stop, it's a little better than what you would expect. Some dodgy clientele, but the staff were friendly and the food was equal to any other Arby's. 

The tabes were acceptably clean and the bathrooms weren't too bad either. I mean, it's an Arby's people!

I'm giving them four stars because I was pretty much expecting a 2-3 star experience, but was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Maybe it's nostalgia, but I remember Arby's being better as a kid. Soggy buns, deli meet, and the cheese sauce is runny and lacking in flavor. I think the gas station nacho cheese from a pump is a higher quality. We gave them a chance thanks to some mailer coupons and I wish we paid full price at the sub shop across the street. The only thing saving this review from 1 star is the service. No wait (obviously, it was dead) but the two folks working were all smiles and friendly, even giving me a side of Red Ranch for no charge."}
{"text":"Going here on Stephanie St. 8 years and as any fast food restaurant has its share of turnover with the entry level positions but right now they have Mike as the evening manager and GREAT customer service with his staff right now Joshua and Miles do everything they can to provide an OUTSTANDING Experience. Yes you do have to wait for the food here sometimes,  especially slow times to get it fresh and perfect but it's well worth it to Us!"}
{"text":"I fully understand that when you get food through the drive thru that it's good to check your bag to make sure that it looks like everything is in there. However, one would think that it wouldn't actually require opening up the containers while sitting in your car before pulling away from the window. I ordered a Grand Turkey Club only to get home, open up the box, and realize it's a Max roast beef in the box. Totally different item and of course I'm not driving all the way back. Glad I wasted money on a sandwich that is NOT cheap to begin with and then don't get to enjoy it at all."}
{"text":"While our cashier Beth I believe was nice the woman who had come fix the order Amy was not very nice. She was rude about it and I didn't appreciate it. I think she needs retrained on customer manners. Being rude when one wasn't rude in first place isn't quite kind."}
{"text":"RUDE ! Especially the female manager. I feel sorry for the people who have to work with her. I believe the older gentleman should be the manager he's been their for years and never gives you attitude. The food comes out a mess and barely any cheese and the cheddar. It's like they're rationing CHEESE ! every other Arby's makes them right except for this one."}
{"text":"Well, I went to Arby's today to get a chicken sandwich and mozzarella sticks, both of which I was craving. Went through drive through, and still waited a while to get my food. Thought this was a drive through of a fast food restaurant. I get my food and start eating it. At first I thought it was just a very fatty chicken sandwich. After eating nearly half of this sandwich, I take it apart to get the fat out. Turns out, I was eating RAW chicken!! The outside was barely cooked, just the fried breading, and the rest was completely RAW. I turned around and went back, spoke to the manager and demanded my money back. First thing she asked me? \"Can I get you a new one?\" No, you already fed me a raw chicken sandwich, no way will I let you feed me something else equally or more harmful to me. Now, 12 hours later. I am still very nauseous, struggling to keep my little bit of dinner down. All I've been able to eat today is a little bit of dinner. I can't even drink without almost losing it all. And I've had a fever for over 9 hours now. Definitely will never eat at Arby's again. Especially at this place. Can't believe they gave me raw chicken. Salmonella poisoning anyone?"}
{"text":"Service here is always good, and there's very little wait even though they are at a busy intersection.

good food.  I love that Jamocha shake"}
{"text":"Ah curly fries, I've loved you since I was about  10yrs old. Hot fresh seasoned curly potatoes, such perfection. And now let's add the hot cheddar cup of cheese to dip them in!!! And that's just one of their sides potato cakes, mozzarella sticks, they also have onion rings, but I've never had them.
As for the sandwiches the hubby always gets the french dip (pretty good choice) sometimes he'll surprise me and go with the beef n cheddar. I love the onion roll it comes on.
Overall even the chicken cordon bleu is also very tasty.
I think of Arby's as the upper level of fast food. If you have enough room in your belly try a turnover! 
Maybe I'll have to try a mega meat stack next visit."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know...I'm one of THOSE Yelpers: always reviewing fast food places. 

I can't help myself. I love me some damn sliders. 

This particular Arby's location has consistently (and when I say consistently, I basically mean an shamefully constant number of visits) perfect in service and food quality. My items are ALWAYS hot and fresh, no matter the time. The employees always have a smile on their faces, are super polite, and even strike up a convo with me from time to time. Everything is fast, also. Can't say enough great things about this Arby's.  

Visit this location if you're thinkin' Arby's!"}
{"text":"i simply love Arby's.  Now this place is cool.  The staff is great, and they make a nice jamocha shake, like with fresh milk."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh why do I do it? Drawn to this place by a coupon I got the beef and cheese with bacon and side salad. Absolutely tasteless, yuck!! The side salad was good, pretty basic. I asked for Italian but I should have gotten Ranch because they had shredded cheddar on this salad. Anyway if you order make sure you ask for an extra pack of dressing because mine only lasted for half a salad and I wound up throwing the other half out. Maybe it's a bad thing they don't have the goth girl who would look at you with disgust and actually throw your food at you at this place anymore. I mean she kept me away"}
{"text":"Stopped off for a bite to eat and I was pretty pleased.  I ordered a half pound French dip and asked them to wrap in lettuce and remove bun.  They were more than happy to and it was delicious.  The two staff members were quite friendly and I would come back.  My wife ordered a chicken cordon Bleu and she was very pleased with the level of sauce and overall flavor."}
{"text":"Nice clean, new Arby's location. Drive through line was quite long at 1:30. I went in to order to go and was in and out before the car I would have been behind had even ordered. 

The service was friendly, dining room very clean, and order was hot, fresh, and ready quickly. 

The new limited time Pizza Slider is defined worth trying if you like spicy Italian sandwiches."}
{"text":"My experience was not good at this particular arbys I had to wait a the drive thru to place my order for what seemed like forever and then I had to wait what seemed like forever at the window for my food Will not come back here again"}
{"text":"This is the best Arby's around! The wait is a little long sometimes, but the always get your order right and your food is always fresh. They often send coupons out in the mail and in the Centennial View, also they usually have other rotating deals in house. Nothing really to complain about there, they make sure the food on your tray if in your bag really is Good Mood Food! ;-)"}
{"text":"The staff at this Arby's location are friendly and the food at this establishment is really good. I have no huge complaints about my experience at this restaurant. Yes, my food did take a while, but it was a busy day and they were genuinely working to make everyone happy. The only complaint that I really have is just that they could use a good remodeling."}
{"text":"Walked in and had to wait a few minutes before anyone came to help. 

The employee that did come was nice though. Had to wait 3-4 minutes to get my food with no other customers around. They didn't have any fries but when they made them least they were fresh!! As for the roast beef sandwich it tasted old  and not fresh whatsoever. 

Also I could see the employee in the back using a machine to slice tomatoes with only wearing one glove and after she cut them she used her hand without the glove to put them in a container. Absolutely disgusting. This is why people get sick because employees are lazy to stay clean and use gloves.  I may or may not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"One of the best arbys location I've been to. Been here for lunch a few times and always gotten a good meal. My sandwich tastes nice and warm and juicy, as well as do my fries!  If you want Arbys then this is the place to go to get it."}
{"text":"I just got a new job near here and I can't believe who BLOWN away by this place I've become.... It's ARBY'S for goodness sake!

I've been about six times in about a month and a half and the sandwiches have been STACKED with meat. All I get is just the sandwich, no 'meal deal' and there has yet to be a time I walk away hungry. The bread has taste. The service is super friendly....

Please, don't change!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean, Dujuan was very friendly and helpful. I had the buffalo chicken sliders and natural fries with a chocolate shake, my wife had the French dip.  Both meals were excellent, but Duran made it a 5 star visit."}
{"text":"Love having an Arby's in Cornelius and LOVE how well this place has run since the day it opened. The staff is super friendly and really quick - even when they had just opened up. I was expecting the normal kinks in a new restaurant (even chains experience them) but this location has been awesome since the start. The staff there rocks!"}
{"text":"Had a pretty interesting experience at this location. I ordered, received my food, and was very much satisfied with the staff as well as the order. They were all friendly and quick just as expected. What i did not expect was the disheveled homeless man that came in screaming as well as swinging at the staff and customers. The manager came out in a matter of seconds to escort the man off the property. The man started swinging fists and threatening customers as they pushed him out. When the manager came back, she made sure all the customers were ok and not shook up. Personally i thought the entire experience was entertaining, but bless that woman for taking the time to care for every person in the restaurant and having such a fast reaction time! I definitely wouldn't want to mess with her!!"}
{"text":"I'm actually really upset they forgot my mozzarella sticks that I paid for and my lemonade tasted like shit. :/"}
{"text":"Sat in the drive thru for 35 minutes!! Only 2 cars ahead of us and zero people inside. Wtf???!!!! Horrible customer service. We stopped coming to this location due to same reason. After a year or two we decided to try again. Big mistake. Go to a different location or skip it altogether !!!"}
{"text":"Michael was an outstanding order taker he is pretty uplifted our food came out pretty quickly to. The place is overall a nice and clean environment and it's nice being a college student in between classes to be able to stop by and get your food quickly and have good service. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I just had to comment on how nice the staff is! Every time I eat here the drive thru attendants are friendly and efficient. I appreciate that so much! You should do your best no matter what it is you do and I very much appreciate the good customer service!"}
{"text":"Arby's has to be worst of the worst of fast foods. The meat tastes unreal like it came from a polyester cow or something. I have yet to get anything at Arby's that I like. It is one of those places one goes with the crowd not because you want too."}
{"text":"Your basic run of the mill Arby's nothing really stood out for me. The service was good, the food was hot and delicious. I wasn't disappointed, just wasn't wow'd by any aspect. 

Pros: Close to my home, good service, food was hot and fresh. 

can't say anything for the interior of the restaurant as I went through the drive through.

NOTE: They are giving 15% off military discount for an undetermined amount of time"}
{"text":"I always get great service and food here, today who ever was making the sandwiches clearly did not know the difference between jalapeño and green bell peppers, my jalapeño roast beef slider had no jalapeños, but strips of green pepper, and my chicken cordon blue sandwich seriously had to have 1/4 cup of mayo on it.  Didn't eat much of either sandwich, probably should've threw $9 out the window"}
{"text":"Arby's is definitely king of the fast food joints on the Blvd.  For that, I'd give it five stars.  However, it's still fast food, which explains the mediocre rating.  Do not go here without a coupon from the Sunday paper--there's a whole page of them at least once a month.  The staff here is very nice and very fast, and on the whole, the food is better than elsewhere by the river if you're stuck with a fast food choice."}
{"text":"Order the smokehouse brisket combo. When I got home they put in a French dip sandwich and forgot my curly fries. This is the second time Arby's messed up the order and they were two different locations. Upsetting because the food is good but service is terrible."}
{"text":"Worse place!  I ordered a crispy chicken salad and was told it would take 5 mins, no problem I waited.  I then get my salad and the chicken is RAW.  I went to return my salad to get money back and was told, \"But that is what you ordered\"  Really, I didn't know RAW chicken was on the menu.  After another 5 mins I finally received my refund, but no apology or anything.  Will NEVER GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the new brown sugar bacon sandwich because the picture advertised looked heavenly.  Well the sandwich I got could be best described as a lettuce sandwich with a hint of bacon. Total rip off for the price - would never order again"}
{"text":"Slow service I only gave 2 stars because I absolutely love their fries other than that food wasn't that great and took 15 min to make one sandwich"}
{"text":"They have a coupon for a 2 for $6 sandwich. We went and got the loaded Italian. Omg just the best sandwich ever at Arbys. Great flavor,just the right size. You leave wigh your mouth full of fabulous flavors. It's totally worth the try."}
{"text":"Accurate orders, great tasting food, friendly service. I highly recommend dining in as the atmosphere inside is warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"I've had quite a few issues with this particular restaurant. From uncompleted orders to a issue with a rude owner. Hopefully they take the time to improve on customer service and accuracy."}
{"text":"Ive come to this location on my work days because they are friendly and ive had no problems ordering a crispy chicken salad. Ive even waited 5min for them to cook the chicken. 

However this time, after i ordered and went back to work, i saw they didnt even put chicken in and there was one bacon strip. And i thought no big deal, i'll email them so for future reference they know. But now their website has an error and i cant send them anything. I even called and no response. Way to stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Ok, now i have to say I am a big Arby's fan.  Love this place normally just not this particular location.  The drive thru line is long.  Staff isn't exactly friendly and for some odd reason the food just tastes bland.  
I tried to get through the drive thru in the short amount of time I had for lunch and it was funny to watch the Del Taco next doors line move faster with more people in it than this Arby's."}
{"text":"Out of all the Arby's I've ever been to, this is by far the cleanest and nicest, and has best quality of food.

I always eat Arby's after proctoring for a large SAT tutoring company on a Saturday or Sunday morning. It's a secret tradition I've decided to keep to myself...shh don't tell anyone! ;) Post making students fall asleep to a standardized test, I came here for my routine late breakfast.

This location has fresh food with more flavor than other locations. The food was ready quickly without error. Better yet, the walls didn't smell like 5-year-old curly fry oil.

The place is immaculate compared to most Arby's, and it even meets my high standards for cleanliness that are usually way above what I actually get at a fast food place.

The people are nice and move quickly. I feel bad for them because the average age of the people rolling in here is about 71.6 years, so they have some picky, stubborn customers. They trend to be overly critical...don't believe a word they say. Luckily most of those fogies don't know how to Yelp, or what the internet is.

Also Tasha is new, but she is fabulous. She gives customer service with a smile and seems to be a genuinely nice person, concerned with making people happy. Give her a compliment for me if you read this, go to this location, and have her ring you up. :) #payingitforward"}
{"text":"It just isn't as good as it used to be. Even using a coupon, the quality of the beef and bun were just sub-par. I won't be wanting to go again for a long time, if ever."}
{"text":"I LOVE their French Dip!! I didn't wait long at all in the drive thru, great customer service with delicious food!"}
{"text":"We got the new philly steak sandwich.  It was very good, people were friendly, and the horsey sauce was plentiful.  Wish they had coke products,"}
{"text":"Took so long to get our food, 20 minutes is ridiculous. I get faster service at a sit down restaurant.

They messed up our order and the two people before us.

Problems? Large onion rings only half full. No cheese in the mozzarella sticks. 

The food is good but not good enough to justify the price vs wait time.

Thank goodness the beef and cheddar was delicious or it would be a one star"}
{"text":"I need to show this Arby's some Yelp love.  I've probably been there 2 dozen times in the past 3 years and the food is always fresh and fast, and the employees are always friendly.  I was a bit disappointed when they stopped serving breakfast because their bacon, egg, & cheese croissants are waaaaay better than those gut bomb croissanmiches that BK sells.  But, I don't need to eat that stuff very often anyway, so it's ok.

I've had the new smokehouse brisket sandwich twice now and it's really good.  I think they could put a few more of those fried onions on it because I think the two times I've had it there've been like two.  It's still a great sandwich.  The brisket is very tender and smoky and you can't beat smoked gouda.  

For years I used to crave a Beef and Cheddar, but once I lived in St. Louis and had roast beast sandwiches at Lion's Choice I could never go back to Arby's for that.  I do enjoy the roast turkey and swiss sandwich at Arby's and have found that to be a good option when I'm traveling and my only choices are an Arby's, a Sonic, or a gas station.  That's really a tasty sandwich too.  I'm not big on fries or soda, but they usually have decent tea so I get by."}
{"text":"Being a test market restaurant, do not expect everything that is advertised on Arby's commercials. Some food items are not included in the 2pm - 5pm time frame that are normally included in Arby's in other sections of the country. I discovered this to my dismay today.

1. Arby's in other states are offering the $1 value menu all month of July regardless of the time of day. I know this to be true since I have the receipt to prove it.
2. Arby's in other states include Shakes, cookies, turnovers, fries and sliders in their $1 deal. 

But this Arby's is a test market restaurant and does not feature everything you will see on a commercial.

With that being said, the service is awesome, the restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. I like the remodel job. This is my hometown and I'm glad to have one close to my house."}
{"text":"The girl working drive thru was the nicest and best customer service I've ever received at this location. It was on Monday October 9th at 5:30pm"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're in a hurry because it'll take forever just to get your order in. Not sure if it's just because this location looks like an old skool Arby's, but a lot of old people come here and take forever reading the menu and deciding on what to order even after they're up at the register...I think I waited like 10 min behind them just so they could have a discussion with each other and with the cashier about different menu items, trying to figure out if you can sub different kinds of meat or bread on stuff...why not just order it the way it comes! Whatever. My order was simple and still came out before theirs.

The food tastes fresh and is consistent with any other Arby's, although I don't frequent very often. I do enjoy their roast beef sandwiches and curly fries from time to time. Next time I'm not sure though if I'll pick this location..."}
{"text":"Going out of business. this place has been in Oakland for over 30 years. It will be missed. April 2 the last day."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Ordered 5 items through drive thru, and dear Lord it took 20 mins to get it food.  The server,  some young girl, stood leaning with no sense of urgency at all. Plus the order was not correct. This was horrible.  Never go there again."}
{"text":"Not sure why a fast food place takes 15 minutes in line after ordering to get food, but whatever.  Literally left Petsmart at 700pm as they were closing, drove out of line after receiving my food, with only 2 cars ahead of me when I entered the drive thru, at 715pm. Ordered a combo meal with cheese curly fries. Normally, in the past, the cheese comes in a plastic to-go container, since I'm in the Drive-Thru and it's to-go. Last night, the cheese was drizzled on top of the fries.?   For whatever I may have paid extra for the cheese, it was less than a teaspoon.  When I got home and took the fries out of the bag, yep, you guessed it, they tipped over and the cheese that was on the top of the fries fell onto the table and I no longer had cheese fries.  Won't be going to this location again."}
{"text":"Fourth in line at the drive-thru and it takes no less than 20 minutes to get my hand tossed Italian sub and cold curly fries...silly me for craving Arby's when I coulda had a Double Double just 100 feet away in less time. 

Are they still asking for $15 an hour?

smh..."}
{"text":"Not a very good experience. We stood there without being acknowledged for 10 minutes. Then when the food came, the bun on my sandwich was stale and the fries were cold. My husband ordered extra swiss and when his sandwich came, there wasn't extra swiss. The lady behind the counter fought with my husband saying it was on there. Why fight with the customer over a piece of cheese? I won't come back to this place."}
{"text":"They've got the MEATS! I like this location- conveniently on Monroe Road heading to Uptown.

I like the roast beef and/or turkey.

Love the curly fries and also the jalapeño poppers. 

They have some good deals running weekly/

Buy 2 fish sandwiches for $5. Buy 2 gyros for $6.

The inside is clean and they usually have some classic rock playing.

The drive thru is fast and they always say \"happy to help\".

Go have some hefty sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food is good but it's never crowded in their restaurant. Possibly the location partly could be the service.  I had to repeatedly ask the counter staff gal what she said and after the 3rd time I thought.... I hope she stays in school cause she is not capable of customer service..  I eventually gave up ... . In the end it cost me double as the counter staff double billed us on drinks and it took a Manager to undo what she charged us. Maybe she was new ? Maybe she was not ? Either way we could not understand her mumbling and it was to our disadvantage... 
we ordered 2 roast beef sandwiches which is their main staple / standard... and added a shake in place of a drink ( should have been an up charge not 3 drinks) . 
Anyway the food was good .... listening to the kitchen help banter the whole time over top of the music was unexpected and annoying. 
All in all it was just an overpriced meal with way too loud staff in an empty restaurant.  Would I recommend it?   Sure if you use the drive thru .... inside experience not so much."}
{"text":"We decided to grab something quick so we stopped into this Arby's.  OMG!!!! First the drive thru line was all the way to the front of the restaurant,  so we walked inside to order. BAD mistake! The line for walk up order was long as well. Every employee working looked like high school students with NO directions. They were obviously under staffed for a Saturday afternoon. It took us 15 minutes total  to order and receive our food. As a business owner myself I know better then to be under staffed on a busy Saturday lunch rush."}
{"text":"I'm giving this Arby's 4 stars based on comparisons to other Arby's or fastfood joints, not other restaurants. 

Anyways, basically here's what went down when I was here, Arby's  had some deal for a French dip value meal for $5 but I also wanted some beef & cheddar sandwiches and they were 2 for $5 as well. Basically I was a fat ass this day and ordered both deals, which I justified my gluttony by telling myself that I always spend $10 or more on lunch. 

This was an great lunch! I didn't eat it all but I got to eat all the stuff I wanted to. I have a strange Arby's guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"It's Arby's. The food is like the food at every other Arby's. What make this location get two stars is the unbelievable drive through times. I have never seen \"fast food\" operate so slowly. And there doesn't even have to be a rush! It's horrible."}
{"text":"Not a really busy place. But I like their chicken sandwich with the shredded lettuce. Their mozzarella sticks are amazing. Always get them when I visit. They have either 4pcs or 6 pcs for mozzarella sticks. 

They have some deals for 2 for $6. It is pricey here. 

They only have curly fries. 

They also have roast beef sandwiches."}
{"text":"This location isn't anything special.
Walked in and the guy behind the counter was not friendly and this place never has anyone here.
He grabbed our cups with his hands in it. Asked for another and called him out on it. They microwaved the sandwiches. Ahhh. The one by my house is better."}
{"text":"Arby's is a nice change of pace when you're in a fast food mood (or time compressed).  

The Beef'n'Cheddar is a comforting reminder of simpler times (make sure to ask for Horsey Sauce to go with it) and their curly fries are really good.  

Used to LOVE the jamocha shakes (back when my metabolism could support that...)"}
{"text":"I love the beef and cheddar. 
I've been going to this location for years.
They have always treated me very good and there have been times that they didn't have a special on the beef and Cheddar but they gave to me as a special.
They know me by name and treat me special.
I love this place.
Yes they could use a facelift to the site.
But this is fast food at its best.
They have the meat."}
{"text":"This Arby's is good. Brandy was super sweet(and cute) and very helpful. The service was quick and the food was hot and fresh. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Arby's is hands down my favorite fast food option. Pretty psyched a new location opened in Cornelius. It's across from tenders. Love their grilled chicken sandwich and when they have mint choc milkshakes stop the train are they good. 

We stopped in seeing their \"now open\" sign and they literally had just opened today. Super clean and friendly staff and very hot food. 

Since we were one of the first 50 customers the kids got to spin the opening day wheel and won a milkshake - you would have thought they had won the powerball. Now I really feel like I won the powerball because the first 50 customers got a free meal each week for a year!  That's right 52 meals!!  I mean seriously that's like over $400 of food!  So in a year from now if I've gained 50 pounds you'll know I didn't stick to the grilled chicken sandwich ;)

Overall glad a new option is in town and that it's away from all the traffic down by Sam fur. It's always weird getting in and out of the fast food area down there. 

Stop in and try that mint choc milkshake if they have them -crazy goodness."}
{"text":"Today was the 3rd visit to their drive-thru in the past 2 months that took over 15 minutes from start to finish. And today they outdid themselves with a whopping 23 minutes from pulling into line to driving away (with an incorrect order). The ordering speaker is so antiquated my husband was literally screaming at the box to get the cashier to repeat the order correctly. (Or maybe the cashier was just completely clueless...)

Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. I was slightly insane to return the 2nd and 3rd time after previous anything but fast food experiences. I'm not completely insane and will never return."}
{"text":"Horrible service via drive thru. Guy was completely rude. I love Arbys but this might make me not."}
{"text":"The wife and I were craving some Arby's.  It has been a couple of years since we have had it and the loaded curly fries in the commercials and Andies mint shake called us in.  The fries and shake did not disappoint.  I have always been a fan of the beef and cheddar also.  Food wise , it was the Arby's that we remembered.  

Now for the restaurant.  There were 4 people in the restaurant when we came in and a car in the drive thru.  The drink/condiment station was absolutely torn apart and there was trash and a stickiness on the floor.  As we searched for a table every one of them was dirty, crumbs, caked on stuff, ECT.  And the garbage bins had trays piled all over them.  I also used the men's room while here, and if we were not about to head into Phoenix, during Friday rush hour, to catch a Suns game I would've walked out.  Nasty is about the nicest way I can think to describe it.  

Having gone through that I cannot think that the food handling practices are good nor the cleanliness of the food prep area, which we could not see.  There seemed to be at least 7 people working and it was slow.  

I cannot eat at a place with the cleanliness standards such as this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"Today my family and I went in and they were super short staffed. Due to the issue the manager on duty Clara went above and beyond to make up for it. We didn't even realize it was an issue until they let us know we didn't mind waiting a bit. Because of the customer service we will definitely be back and the management is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was fine..it's Arby's. What I didn't like was lack of composure displayed by employees and a manager.
At the front registers, an employee asked another one...\"Why did you punch in a mocha shake?\" From the back, the manager yelled...\"Because we don't have a button for the orange cream shake!!! Act like you have been here before!!\". The employee gave the manager a cold stare then looked back at me. I acted like I missed all of that so that the situation didn't blow up. 
The original 2 employees didn't like the reply, you could tell they were irritated. A couple minutes later those 2 got into an argument at the register while about 4 or 5 people were in line waiting to order. Seems they were all pointing the finger about a messed up order. One of the original 2 employees (the one working the register) took off his headset and walked away. Definitely a toxic work place, but it shouldn't be shown to the customers like that. When things like that are going on, it will eventually spill over to the food quality and customers."}
{"text":"I have not been to an Arby's in over a decade.  I decided to stop by the one on Boulder Hwy, with my son, and oh, boy, was that a mistake.  There were 4 people in front of me.  20 minutes later, there were  still 4 people in front of me.  The manager, I think she was the manger, was yelling at one of the employees.  It was very demeaning, stating that if he could not do the job, to go sweep the lobby.  After that happened, I just took a picture of the telephone number they have to call about the restaurant, turned around and left.  That's probably the last time I will ever step foot in an Arby's.  All the people in the restaurant commented on how slow the service is and how rude that lady was.  I guess they only care about the drive-thru but not the customers standing in front of them."}
{"text":"I have a friend who insists we eat here when we get together. Sometimes he wins, sometimes I do. 

Arby's reminds me of the Roy Roger's chain, which I believe they bought a few decades ago, but without the cowboy stuff. The food is not bad now that they have updated their menus. 

But the old beef sandwiches which I do not believe either Geno's nor Pat's would serve in Philly is still on the menu. Ugh. 

Somethings do take a while to die I guess. I also need to get new friends. I'm feeling generous today, so I'll give them two stars for the new menu."}
{"text":"Can't believe this location is still around. Have went through both drive thru and inside to order and I must say going inside was an eye opener. The female voice in the back who was making sandwiches did nothing but complain about every drive thru order because they were having a promotion, 2 for $5, and every one was ordering them in multiples. This was awhile back, but on my most recent visit 2 nights ago it hasn't improved one bit. Ordered 2 French dips with curly fries. The girl handed me the bag of Au Jus and one of the containers was already on its side. ( good thing I checked before I drove forward). Got home and the curly fries were BURNT. So 2 combos with 2 junior ham and cheese came to  over $20... Waste of money, no wonder they never have any cars in their parking lot. Should have went to Sonic."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Arby's for 20 years but in our fatigued grief we at lunch here at 1030am (what were we thinking?).   The roast beef sandwiches, no surprise, taste the same as they did when I was a wee lad, I love that taste actually!   The fries were fries.   The outside speaker was quiet and tinny, it was hard to hear what they were saying.   We ate as I pumped gas next door, quintissential Americana."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent Arby's, and given the condition of the other fast food restaurants on this stretch of Ohio River, it practically reaches exceptional.  The dining room is clean and nicely modern.  The service is friendly.  I don't think I've ever had a bad experience."}
{"text":"We ordered our food and waited at the window for almost 20 minutes and once we got our food we didn't have 2 sandwiches. They have terrible service."}
{"text":"After I got home, I started to eat the fish sandwich, disgusting &... it came with the paper still on the cheese, extremely disappointed in general. Will be in soon for my full refund."}
{"text":"I frequent this Arby's and the most recent time, I got the Porchetta sandwich and Mount Italy sandwich. I spent $16.69 because I wanted to try something new. When I got home, I opened up my food, the product looked nothing like they did in the picture. The images showed it would have a mountain of meat, I opened up the food packages to find each item had two pieces of meat. I was so disappointed, I contacted the restaurant and they didn't respond. I emailed corporate and it has been over a month and still haven't heard back. I typically recommend Arby's to my friends and family when we want something quick to eat because of the food. Arby's you really disappointed me here. I could have spent $16.69 and gotten enough groceries to make each sandwich and been able to have enough for a week. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I always go through the drive through, had fish 2/$5.00. 1 in a regular bun, one on pita bread. I prefered the bun, it was good and hot but had too muvh tartar! Another time I had the french dip, they can keep the salty broth but the sandwich was better than i ever thought it would be. Yes, the service wad kinda slow but they're kids and the food was hot."}
{"text":"First time at Arby's in years. First time at this one though. I arrived at 11:40 AM on Black Friday and it was completely empty: not a good sign. 

I ordered the 'two-for-$5' deal and got beef and cheddars. I always get those since I love onion rolls. The sandwiches were very sloppily put together though. The meat was all on one side, the sauce on the other and the wrapper was so loose I could see the bread just by peeking into the bag. 

Too bad. Arby's can be good if just a couple of tweaks are made. This establishment obviously doesn't care. I guess that's why this one was empty?"}
{"text":"I know what your thinking, 4 stars for fast food?! LOL

The hotel I'm staying in put us in the area and I was ready to grub but didn't know what was down here until we went down a bit further and found Arbys, Jack in the Box, Wendy's and Sonics! 

We came in to catch our breath after a long day and I was ready to grub! We had such a friendly cashier, which is a bonus since with fast food employees tend to be crabby at times LOL

What I love the best is that my chicken slider wasn't overcooked like it was back home! It was cooked perfectly and super fresh and moist!

I must have been pretty hungry because I sniffed up most of my food! If I'm in the area again I'd come back! ^__^"}
{"text":"So, It is Arby's but----can't believe that they do the charity events and still give good service."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Arby's? I mean come on man, as far as fast food goes, this is as good as it gets. You'll pay a little more for a lot more flavor. It's only 4 stars because the wait at this location is a little long but otherwise a great experience.
I can't get enough of that classic roast beef. Even after inhaling the half pounder, I still wanted more. I love sauce in general and I think the combination of the horsey and Arby's sauce together on that soft warm bun could make a grown man cry. That stuff would make a rubber tire edible but on that succulent roast beef, I man come on man."}
{"text":"I come here quite often and only had a couple mishaps in those times. Each time the employees were very apologetic and rectified the situation. Great customer service from somewhere you wouldn't expect."}
{"text":"10/2/2015
You would think that my wife and I would eat at this location more often as our family lives in Mahomet. That and the amount of Arby's coupons that arrive in our mail box every month, it is affordable to eat there as a family. But, our experiences with this Arby's have varied from five stars to zero stars (if that was available.)  
My wife and I went in Friday night before 7 p.m. and noticed that the sitting area was clean but the men's room was another story. Even if the men's bathroom was clean, I still probably won't use it if possible. It needs to be updated seriously and the lock on the stall door is missing so they did a poor job putting a slide bolt on the door. The young man who took our order did a really good job, especially since we used coupons. Decent response time on getting our food, but we got an order of mozzarella sticks instead of the jalapeno poppers we ordered. That and we ordered 2 chocolate turnovers as late night snack but got one chocolate turnover and a cherry turnover with chocolate icing. 
The biggest disappointment we had was that the lobby did not have any iced tea. This seems to happen often after dinner rush. my wife had to go to the counter to get iced tea from the drive thru. The employee did not listen to my wife say that there was no iced tea left in the lobby and insisted that there was tea in the container. My wife had to stop the manager on duty and tell her that there was no tea in the lobby and she needed iced tea. The manager seemed put off that she had to actually stop helping drive thru and get my wife iced tea that we paid for. Sadly, this was the third time that this has happened in the last handful of times that we have been there. Overall, this experience was one of the worst we ever had and the only high light of this experience was the young man who took our order."}
{"text":"On a sunday, was in a mood for a chicken sandwich ,staff is very polite, but their crispy chicken sandwich sucks! Chick-fil-a kicks ass as their chicken sandwich is so much better."}
{"text":"Great for a quick RB fix.
They get at least one item wrong 1 out of 5 visits in drive-thru.
Leo Getz was right."}
{"text":"You suck you suck you really really do suck 
Your mozzarella cheese sticks for the last 4 times i had given you chances after chances after chances are always cold and no longer made fresh 
Your samwhich's a regular rost beef and a ruben 9.00 WOW and your shakes have been down for like a month now 
I wish i knew someone who cared to make the food for people who spend there hard earned money on it right you suck Arbys and who ever your management is they suck too for not checking on the way food is served anymore"}
{"text":"Good food , great service, nice atmosphere.lots of different meats not just roast beef. Even Greek gyros . This is a much bigger and better Arby's than most . If you enjoy your food don't forget to ring the bell on your way out."}
{"text":"My second time to a Arby's ever and my last. Saw the commercial for the Pork Belly sandwich and wanted to give it a try.  I don't do fast food only in extreme emergencies. I remember as I I was walking in saying hope I don't regret this. Well this was the saddest sandwich ever. I thought the pork was going to be crunchy and deep fried. !WRONG! Couldn't find the onion rings and the sandwich was soggy."}
{"text":"It's your basic Arby's.  Even the things that sound healthy are fattening, so get whatever you want!  I'm partial to the #4 (the roast beef with cheddar and that yummy sauce that no one knows exactly what it is).  I LOVE curly fries!  I always get a chocolate turnover at the end.  The reason that I like this location over the Cranberry one is that this location keeps their turnovers hot!  Yum!"}
{"text":"I love the beef and cheddar with horsey sauce. The bogo roast beef sandwich is a good deal. The curly fries are a little greasy for my. I love the cherry turnover. Plus they have good brewed ice tea."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see other peoples negative experiences at this location......I visited today to pick up lunches for a group of people and was actually really impressed......the place was very clean, the employees (all female from what I saw) were very nice- excellent customer service- and the order, even though large, was PERFECT.....when I left I literally thought \"Wow, that place is run like a ship!\".....As I have said in other reviews, I have 30 years in food, retail, customer service.....and I KNOW when a place is run by a competent owner/manager and staffed by well-trained employees......this was my first visit to this location, so maybe I just got lucky? I don't know, but my visit was perfect. Another review sited difficulty of getting in/out (onto Rt. 22) , that's understandable, but beyond control of the business and determined by external traffic conditions...."}
{"text":"I was here on 8/19/14 and had the pleasure to meet Keith Dorset who attended the drive through window.  I was quite impressed with his friendly demeanor and joy he displayed at the opportunity to assist with my order.   I must say that I have never been greeted so enthusiastically and with genuine pleasure.  I hope he is still employed here, if not - it would be a shame.   BTW - the food was fabulous as was the Orange Milkshake.  

The service was just totally outstanding!  So much so that I contacted their Corporate Office, acknowledged him on Trip Advisor and nominated him for Exceptional Service on Trip Advisor."}
{"text":"I always get super friendly service at Arbys, this location is no exception. Very happy staff that definitely works to please. I wish more places had service like Arbys. My dining experience(s) here are always pleasant."}
{"text":"I was a little worried about eating here with very little reviews and the ones they did have were not the best, however the food was good! Staff was friendly and food was out quick and both the eating area and restrooms were very clean. I don't think there is such a thing as a 5 star Arby's but this is about as good as it gets for them! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very clean. Fast and accurate orders. Friendly employees. Many new menu choices."}
{"text":"Real professional service. The staff was really nice and were very friendly. They were even kind enough to give extra sauce at no charge."}
{"text":"No way to give this horrible place 0 stars or I would. Does the owner even check how these places are managed? The current manager of this Arby's needs to be \"managed up\". Very rude. If this individual went through any type of training, he certainly missed the part on customer service. Hardly ever see cars at this place any more wonder why. Good  luck Arby's owner, hopefully this place closes real soon. Doubt you will see this or all the other 1 star reviews, maybe you need to be \"managed up\"."}
{"text":"Again, general fast food rules apply here for me once again, no fast food restaurant can receive five stars, there's just no way the food can be of quality enough to warrant five stars. That's my rating philosophy, it is what it is. 

For starters, considering the area this restaurant is in, it is definitely incredibly clean and well kept for a fast food restaurant. Many others in the area are nothing short of disgusting, so I was pleasantly surprised to see this. There was a guy there doing maintenance when I was there too, so someone clearly makes sure this place stays in good shape. 

The staff were attentive, not particularly friendly though. No one smiled. No one was necessarily rude, but the two employees I interacted with were just rather flat. 

The food wait was a bit long. After ordering it took about 5 minutes for my food to be called out, despite the fact that I saw it ready the entire time I was waiting. They were a little busy and a little understaffed, so this may have been why. 

Food itself was typical for Arby's. Not mind blowing, but decent. Huge homestyle fan myself, but not going to lie, I get excited when a few curly fries accidentally sneak in the fry box. I'd come back to this location if I was in the area.

{"text":"Good, quick food. A little pricey for fast food but still in range of current prices.  The New BBQ Beef Brisket was good but had no BBQ on it.  Good thing I got Arby's Sauce."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for lunch and it was pretty decent for a fast food quality. We were greeted really nicely as soon as they acknowledge us. I loved the loaded Curley fries. Pretty bomb"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. I came here around 7pm on a Tuesday night with my daughter and the place was slow and it was trashed. I told the manager politely to just to bring it to her attention and it took her about 20 minutes to get someone to tidy the place up. There was pop sprayed all over the floor by the registers so bad that my feet were sticking to the ground.. The sauce dispensers had hardened sauce all over them and sauce all over the counter.  I love Arby's and will not be returning back just because the poor costumer service and professionalism."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for a quick bite after a movie and found the service to be flat and the food very average.  

I hadn't been in an Arby's for a few years, but thought we would give them a try since Wendy's bought them a while ago.  UGH!  

I guess it will be a few more years before I come back.  Sorry, guys!"}
{"text":"I've been going to drive-thru restaurant since the mid 1960, and I'm here to say that this restaurant has the most incredibly consistent TERRIBLE SERVICE that I've ever encountered. 

Over the last five years, our family has used this Arby's restaurant simply because there are no other Arby's around to go to. Each and every time we drive thru, without question, an item is missing or the order is somehow wrong. Once again tonight, we drive thru and order three items, the person taking the order sounded like he had a sock crammed in his mouth while he spoke, it took 10 minutes to fill the order, we get home, and there's no bbq sauce or horseradish sauce in the bag. 

NEVER AGAIN! I WILL NEVER SPEND ONE MORE DIME IN THIS DUMP!"}
{"text":"I just had my arby's sandwich. Putting in this review quickly. So that I leave back a warning, in case I die!! 
Horrible food! The chicken is clearly stale. It's hard texture gives away. Curly fries have a bad bitter after taste, I'm guessing the oil has been in use since the discovery of oil. I have never thought in my life that a molten lava cake could taste bad, and voila, \"Welcome to Arby's\". Never going back!!! Strongly discouraged!!"}
{"text":"So, we don't eat at Arby's often, and when we do I'm *always* pleasantly surprised when we have amazing service. Drive through or eat in, doesn't matter! The staff is always friendly and accommodating to our needs!"}
{"text":"Tried their 2 for $5 fish sandwiches and their $1.89 side salad.  The fish sandwich had too much bread for my liking and the fish was just okay.  The salad was iceberg and not worth me getting again.  The service was excellent and the lady manager is doing a great job,  The place is nicely decorate but I didn't think the food was worth me coming back for,"}
{"text":"Waited in drive thru for 10 min. When I got to window my chicken still needed to cook so they asked me to pull around.  I smiled and said ok. I waited for 5-6 more min before the guy came out with my food. He said oh sorry, we ran out of beef. I didnt order any beef. .. I had two kids in the car one being 3 months old crying. And my chicken wasnt even hot! I am pretty sure that they forgot about me."}
{"text":"I always get fast and good service in the drive thru. The shift manager on duty yesterday was very nice."}
{"text":"Went thru the drive-thru and the Jamaican taking the orders was Extremely Rude. Tried to ask question and she had no time for question. The order was incorrect when I got to the window and I was told it was my fault.
Pretty disgusted at the quality and the service.
I'll vote with my dollar and not return."}
{"text":"Unlike the Arby's in Whiteville, NC this locations dining room was actually open. I finally got to enjoy the Reuben sandwich I've been craving. I nibbled on the new sliders, I don't like the Swiss cheese? that is on them, but those are the biggest sliders I've ever seen. A 2 slider combo meal could easily be filling. I've never dined inside this location but it was very clean and the cashier was friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered the Turkey Swiss market fresh sandwich. My sandwich was made fresh to order which impressed me and my curly fries were hot. It's hit or miss with this Arby's an it was a hit!  

I really enjoyed my lunch."}
{"text":"The food was great but the manager running around calling his employees inconpitant not so cool . Brian was his name if I'm not mistaken and the little red head kid delivering the orders was extremely rude. And after eating I waited 15 minutes to get a bag. I'll rather drive further to a different arbys or just drive past it to sonic in the future."}
{"text":"Really like the Roast Beef on King's Hawaiian Roll sandwich.  It costs about $6.50 though.

Child likes the jr. chicken sandwich.

French fries and curly fries are not good."}
{"text":"About once per year I'll get suckered into going back to Arby's to try something out because they have a coupon. Today I went in to try out their chicken sandwiches. Since it was a two for $5 deal I tried two different sandwiches. The Chicken bacon swiss, and the Cordon blue. Both were very bland, except for the nasty metallic taste in the chicken. Even the bacon was horrible, and that's hard to do. It was way over microwaved I think. 

I think this was my last visit to Darby's for good this time, since the last 3 visits have all been horrible!"}
{"text":"Great food as always, Arby's is number one in roste beef in the entire world honestly, Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We went to eat in the Arby on Stephenie on Sat. 12/09/17.  I will never return to eat at this location again. We could not find a clean table to eat on and had to wipe one off ourselves to use. The restrooms were very disgusting. They did not get our order right and we took it back and they then gave us the right one. The food was terrible and I ended up throwing it in the garbage. They really didn't even deserve the one star I gave them."}
{"text":"After a coworker came back from lunch with a roast beef sandwich on a King's Hawaiian roll from Arby's, I knew I had to go get one!

Located on South Blvd, near the Woodlawn intersection, in the same shopping complex as The Home Depot, Firehouse Subs and I think a TJ Maxx(?), the line at 12:50 on a bleh Wednesday was about 5 cars deep.  And of course I got behind the lady who didn't have windows that rolled down so she had to open her door, was placing separate orders for several people and I heard a lot of \"ummmmmmmmmm....\".  Go inside, fool!  The line did move fairly quickly up until her, so they don't play around at the drive thru here.  I ordered the aforementioned sandwich (LOVE King's Hawaiian rolls - that is a relationship that goes back a long time and it runs deep), mozzarella sticks and a cherry turnover.  The sandwich was quite good - I drown it in Arby's sauce, but there was plenty of meat on a large, soft bun.  The mozzarella sticks reminded me of McD's chicken nuggets for some reason - same kind of hard-ish coating instead of a crumby one, but they were as good as fast food mozz sticks are going to get.  Served with a small cup of marinara sauce, that was more flavorful than what I was expecting.  Cherry turnover was good - standard cherry pie filling in a flaky triangle of fluffy pastry with a drizzle of white icing across it.  

The employees are quite friendly.  I go to this Arby's every few months and they are always friendly and get my order correct (with plenty of Arby's sauce). 

My lunch was just under $9 and it will get me through to quitting time - good job, Arby's!"}
{"text":"If I could give this no stars, I would. Much like many of my other reviews, it is based on customer service. If you are in a position that requires said skill, you should have it. If you don't, maybe switch a position in the place or look elsewhere for a job. That being said, the drive thru lady (Carol) was completely rude and managed to mess up our simple order of one chocolate shake.  I tried to say hello and make small conversation while waiting, but she totally ignored me. She handed me the drink and didn't say anything. I told her to have a great day and she proceeded to walk away. I don't know if it's just a prerequisite to be a jerk to work at an Arby's, but it sure seems like it. Definitely will be the last time I come to this or any other Arby's."}
{"text":"Went to Arby's on February 13th the only good thing was the food was nice and hot, but the roast beef was sliced so thick it made it nasty also my total was $14.26 and I gave the girl $15.26 and she gave me $.74 back which I don't care about just funny"}
{"text":"I've never had an Arby's roast beef. The only time you'll even find me at an Arby's is when I want one of their delicious deli sandwiches! It's like a sandwich I would have made at home had I had the time. They really are just so good! If you've only had their beef you're missing out! And their staff is so friendly!"}
{"text":"They charged $45.29 to my card for a $5.29 meal. Good thing I caught the charge and brought it to their attention."}
{"text":"I rarely stop here for a quick bite to go and thought I'd give it a try. Well the service was fast and got my order to go, but upon reaching my destination and looking forward to grovel on the sandwich just waiting for me.... No Arby's sauce!!! They provided 4 packets of Horsey Sauce but no Arby's Sauce!!! I didn't realize I had to be specific with an order thru the drive thru. Disappointed..  :("}
{"text":"Arby's is something that I can only treat myself to every now and again because out of all the fast food places it is one of the most expensive. I went here to get one of their smoke brisket sandwiches because I love me some brisket and gouda is my favorite cheese. It was okay but I expected better. It wasn't too fresh. When I go back I'll definitely just stick to the usual beef n cheddar."}
{"text":"Sat in the drive thru for a good ten minutes waiting for my food. I was the only car too! Girl that took our order wasn't very friendly either."}
{"text":"The G and I were STARVING after winning another ballroom competition and pulled into this store's drive-thru at 12:01am. They had JUST turned off their \"open\" sign.  Sad. Having worked in the food industry, I was all, \"we outta here\", but he had already gotten to the box to order. The VERY nice lady told us not to worry, they were working on an order for a car before us and we should order. We waited only a tiny bit of time for fresh tasty fries and RB sammies and a woman working was super-cool. We tried to tip her and the other workers for being so gracious, but she refused and said she was happy we were happy. What?! Who does that? 
Thanks, random OH Arby's."}
{"text":"On Wednesday afternoon (2 days ago) we had lunch at our local Arby's.  We both had their French dip sandwich and we both thought them GREAT!  At the time we were there, when the counter wasn't busy, employees of Arby's were cleaning the tables, floor and outside work as well.  It was impressive to see that the employees didn't just stand around doing nothing just because there were no new customers in the restaurant.  The serves was fast and friendly - in fact, after ringing the bell on our way out, one of the employees coming back inside open the door for us and wish us a good day."}
{"text":"To the jerk who was working last night 4/11/13, try working until 11 pm like the hours indicate. I got to the drive thru at 10:35 and wanted to order giant roast beef sandwiches but this lazy @ didn't want to take any more orders. I waited 10 min, circled around again, saw 3 more cars get denied, then I finally left at 10:45.  I saw his ass inside too.  They are Supposed to close at 11pm.  As you can see, when I'm hungry, I want my dam food NOW."}
{"text":"I haven't had Arby's in a long time.  Was craving it though and reminiscing about eating it as a child.  Got a roast beef sandwich here and it was barely edible."}
{"text":"I really get tired of being sent away to wait for my order when there is no one behind me.
The timers are to let management know how long it takes to serve a customer. I see this as cheating!
This review is on service, but I still don't have my food."}
{"text":"This place is PACKED every weekday evening when we pick up a take-out order!!  I remember eating Arby's on occasion when I was a little girl but as an adult I didn't eat there much until recently.

I have to be honest... the booming jocular \"WE HAVE THE MEATS\" voice of Ving Rhames drove me to revisit the restaurant for a Classic Roast Beef Sandwich (Max), potato cakes, and a heavenly Jamocha Shake.  I never realized what I was missing!!  The bun on the Roast Beef Max sandwich is sweet and soft and chewy which enhances the saltiness of the roast beef... the hot crunchy (outside) tender fluffy potato cake (inside) is amazing!  Do I need to sing the praises of the delicious chocolatey coffee-flavored milk shake that is only found at Arby's?  I wish I could get a Jamocha Shake for breakfast!

The location on Graham Road is pretty busy... I've waited in the drive-thru line for 25 minutes (I was 4th in line) and we've also waited in line inside the restaurant for 15 minutes (they were training young summer staff) but we've ALWAYS had exceptional service (and the food is well worth the wait - believe me!)

My husband is more adventurous than I am and he has  ordered the brisket sandwiches, the market sandwiches, and the chicken sandwiches... all delicious!!!!

We LOVE Arby's (especially our hometown location on Graham Road)!!"}
{"text":"It is easy to overlook the commonplace, especially ubiquitous national fast food chains like Arby's. But it is important to congratulate who many may perceive as ordinary particularly when they consistently do an extraordinary job. Such is the case with the Arby's in Middleton out by the Costco. 

I and my family have been coming here since they opened a number of years ago. The store has always been clean and well lit with welcoming and courteous employees.  Indeed, we have tried their patience many a Friday night as various parts of our extended family get together there for dinner. Maybe 15 or so of us, with little kids to boot.  We can sometimes be like a plague of locusts decending upon the store--kids, wrappers, straws, chiding parents and grandma flying about. We always have to apologize for visiting our plague upon them. Yet they are always hospitable and tolerate our clan with grace and aplomb. (We do make extra efforts to clean up after ourselves though so that helps, I think).  While many other things have changed over the years in Madison, this hasn't. Admirable, hey?

I've always considered Arby's as a place for adult fast food. The menu does not particularly cater to children, although there are certainly many things children would like.  Chicken strips, ham and cheese sandwiches, fries, etc.  The menu is a little upscale with interesting sandwiches and salads, all at modest prices. They always seem to have interesting and fun specials.  Now, they are doing a Hawaiian fish sandwich special. \"Meat from the sea,\" is how they describe it.  Tasty breaded fish fillet, tomato, cheese, and tartar sauce sandwiched between a Kings Hawaiian sweet bread bun.  The bun was a little soft for my taste. But they were just like that when I have them growing up in Hawaii.. So all told, just as it should be. Tasty!   At under $7 including tax,  that's a good value!

Also, great curly fries and a fine selection of condiments (Arby's sauce, horseradish, hot sauce, and ketchup--all out of pump dispensers) and a nice selection of soft drinks.  They even have Diet Dr Pepper on their self serve fountain.  My favorite!

Finally, I love their selection of music that they play.  It is a nice mix just right for someone like me who just splits the line between Baby-Boomer and Generation Xer.  There have been a few times when they have played long-lost but much loved songs which I quickly put onto my Apple Music playlist never to be forgotten about again.  (Tom Tom Club anyone?)

I've been to other Arby's around town but this is by far the best. (Second place goes to the one on E. Washington Ave.--same solid menu and people. Just not quite as neatly kept). 

See you there! 

-----
Update - - thought I would try their new pork belly sandwich. I received an advertisement and have to say the picture was enticing. The pork belly is not too bad for fast food. It is served on a kaiser roll with some barbecue sauce and mayonnaise. Worth a try, especially with the coupon for a free drink and fries with purchase of the sandwich ($5.79).   I think it may have been better if my sandwich was warm. It and the curly fries were pretty cold and seemed just slapped together.  The fountain machine was also not functioning and then had no ice when they were able to start it up. There were also people hollering in the kitchen which startled me, even over the music in the store which they had blaring.  Still pretty good music though.

Management changed a number of months ago and I've noticed quality and service have declined noticeably, even for a fast food restaurant.  This has been true for my last three visits.   Sadly, it is definitely not the same store as when I wrote my first review."}
{"text":"Slow slow service I'm the only one here...been sitting In the drive thru for 7 plus minutes now"}
{"text":"I got the Buffalo Chicken sandwich thing and it was amazing! And the next time I got the beef n cheddar and the cheese was all on one side, so I had to mix it myself, but I also got a buffalo slider and it was amazing. So I know what to stick with there lol. 4 stars for the Buffalo Chicken, 3 for the Beef N Cheddar."}
{"text":"This is the best Arby's on the west side, bar none!  There's two reasons why this is true.  First, the blonde guy at the drive-thru (he's been there for a while... I always get him) has top notch customer service skills.  Very thoughtful and extremely helpful.  Second, the food here is made fresh and it would seem they follow the corporate ad picture of how it should look rather than just slop it together and squish it up like most fast food places do.  

Alas, I am biased.  I love the Arby's concept of roast beef and deli sandwiches (such a stark contrast to the usual burger/mexican options).  It's not just the concept/offerings that are great, but many of their preparations actually taste LIKE FOOD!  The smokehouse brisket is amazing, and at 6 bucks, it should be.  Arby's was my very first job, back when I was a wee lad, and at the time they really only served roast beef and potato cakes.  My, have they evolved.  I never had a fast food horror story when I worked there (am I blind or did they just do it right?)  Quality was always the focal point during meal rushes, and we never cut corners or served up the  nasty.  I take those positive memories forward when I order it today.  

I would put Arby's specialty sandwiches on par or better than your sit-down diner equivalents.  With lower prices and a drive-through, the price/convenience factor puts them a step ahead.  This location does it right.  The few times I actually went inside, the dining room was clean and the service very friendly.  If this is a franchise location, the owner should be commended.  If it's corporate, then it sets the standard for how all fast food joints should operate.  It doesn't get a 5th star, well, because jeeez it's still fast food."}
{"text":"Just fast food nothing great just cheap fast food y sodas.If you are casual outing never crowed . It's someplace to eat cheap y fast. Watch the calories! Happy Holidays Yelp readers."}
{"text":"So Arby's has revamped their marketing and I was sold to grab some chicken from a place I have almost forgotten about.

This location is a strange place because it almost seems tucked away and forgotten about. This was our second visit to this location and I'm surprised they are still open. Whenever we go, we are almost the only people in the restaurant. There was one couple and a homeless man who sat near the bathrooms.

We placed our order and the staff who work there seem bored out of their minds. I mean, if no one came to my restaurant, I might feel the same way.

I ordered the chicken nuggets and my husband ordered the new Pork Belly Sandwich. I also tried the Pumpkin cheesecake shake.

1st off, they literally have some of the best chicken I've had compared to most fast food places. I feel the same way about their fries. I rarely get fast food but their stuff is delicious. I tried a bite of the pork belly sandwich and although it was tasty, it was fatty. The shake was alright but not worth the caloric intake. 

We filled up and left. As I was leaving, the homeless man yelled something at me and kept staring. It was a little strange but I shrugged it off. I love Arbys but this location needs some advertising to get people in there. I'm surprised it's still open.

tip: Skip the inside and go through the Drive through for bomb chicken."}
{"text":"Absolute worst Arby's in existence. The old woman who I've seen a few times working here is SO rude."}
{"text":"In the area and stopped here on a whim for lunch. Service was decent at best. Cashier seemed unfamiliar with the menu and cash register. Kitchen was disorganized as no one seemed to know what job they were supposed to be in. Watched multiple people behind us get their order first. Food and fries were fresh."}
{"text":"The customer service just gets worse. Apparently the cashier dude ran out of pennies, for he asked if it was okay that he returned my change with one less cent than I was owed. I was like \"okay, whatever\", because it was clear that he couldn't be arsed to break open a new roll or get a penny out of his pocket or something, so I just wanted to get the transaction over with. I should have known better than to return here!"}
{"text":"Obviously no supervision on site. Soda station a disaster, dirty booth and tables, food all over the floor.  And this is at 7:30 in the evening."}
{"text":"We had excellent service while we were there yesterday. The guy taking orders was very polite."}
{"text":"Be sure to watch your food being made when you can.
The employee making my food had gloves on and while he was
making my food he turned to throw something in the trash and 
then used both hands to push the trash down father in the can, then 
turned back to finish my sandwiches.
I asked for the Manager and got my money back and the Manager
sent the employee to get new gloves.
YIKES!"}
{"text":"Didn't want to honor my coupon. Manager had the audacity to tell me my coupon came from California and that's why it wasn't any good. Coupon says all participating locations. I live in Las Vegas and they mailed it to me so it didn't come from California. I Took my business elsewhere. There's lots of great options all only a short walk away. Didn't even have to drive."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Arby's the food is fresh and relatively fast. The best part about this location is the warm and inviting staff."}
{"text":"Went through drive through, waited around 9 minutes at the window for one chicken sandwich combo, told by worker to pull forward and they would bring it out, waited 15 more minutes because I didn't want to stress out the crew or harass them and they had asked me to wait... before knocking on door to no response, as I was leaving someone came out to take the trash out and realized they had finished my order but no one had the sense to communicate with one another that it was finished and the customer was waiting outside as requested. Not sure who's dumber me for waiting almost a half hour or them for the terrible service. Obviously the food was trash, it was Arby's after all, but this was cold trash."}
{"text":"Arbys is one of the best fast food chains in America and I could eat there everyday. Service is top notch and the food made to order."}
{"text":"They took care of me and made me feel like family. Great food Daniella was awesome! Thanks"}
{"text":"The store manager Miriam can barely speak or understand English which is probably the reason my refund isn't on my debit card (5 days later)The assistant manager is rude, she just works the register and is miserable taking food orders. I told the assistant manager I wanted a refund and she's like \"there's no refunds! Why you want refund? Take too long?\" Had to literally yell at her just so the even worse manager would come refund my money. Wanted a refund after they gave me a pre made milkshake that was separated (must have been 2 days old) and looked like vomit! Also watched both managers throw onion rings and fries in the same basket and same oil and fry everything together. That's just gross. I don't want my fries tasting like onion because you're lazy. Even at mc Donald's they use separate oil for fries, chicken, fish , etc. I don't mind waiting long for something that's actually good. It's Arby's, shouldn't have to wait 20 min for sliced beef on bread and deal with every employees crappy attitude because they chose the wrong career path."}
{"text":"This Arbys in Castle Shannon is not clean and in addition to that, while debating on leaving, a young man working in the back came up front and was talking to a cashier while scratching the heck out of his head..while the cashier was rubbing her mouth.
i couldnt leave fast enough. The manager NEEDS to keep reminding his workers about hygiene.. it should be done at least.once a week..."}
{"text":"Its an Arby's, but its consistent. Never had a messed up order, never had bad service, and that is a lot to say in this day and age."}
{"text":"Tthis has to be the worst Arbys I've ever been to. Horrible customer service. Gave the clueless guy that was working the register a coupon, he had no clue what to do, so he gets the girl to come over I think was the manager?  she takes coupon and tells me the total. I say that's way more than the coupons she mumbles  \"the register doesn't take coupons\" I say \"you don't know how to do it?\" her response \"it does work that way\" pointing at the register ??  'Im blown away at this point.  I just pay the total &  take my coupon back.  Get my food orders and the order was wrong. They fix it, but then I say can I have some sour cream for my potato bites? she says \"we dont have any\" I just shake my head, my friend pull out the food and notice they put sour cream on the loaded fries !!! I will never go back to this location. Tables were dirty, drinks tasted like seltzer and the worst fast food workers. STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"The cleanest fast food restaurant I've been to in the US so far! This is what immediately drew my attention when I came in. This branch has done a great job is keeping this lace spotless! 
Prices are also great. Fast food should be fast and cheap and that's exactly what Arby's is. For a quick bite, this was perfect to keep me going till dinner time with family! Will come back again."}
{"text":"I come here a lot for lunch although today I was a little disappointed I got the brisket meal. And look nothing like the picture. It was so small it almost looks like a double cheeseburger from McDonalds."}

Anyways - I like my ruebans a certain way with extra sourcrout and they don't do that said the manager. That's BS since the other arbys around town make it happen. No Bueno arbys on pecos"}

{"text":"Terrible attitude with terrible service to match.  The only name I see on the receipt is Randy, so I'm going to assume he was the Manager on duty when I went through.  I ordered 3 kids meals and a #9.  Didn't get the fries or drink for the #9, only got 1 of the kids meals and only got charged for 2.   Then when I ask for them to fix it, the manager shakes his head and acts like I'm the one who forgot to push the button and failed to put the correct order out.  Then when they attempted to fix it, they completely forgot the chicken tenders in one bag, and the drink for the #9.  Seriously?"}
{"text":"Skip the Drive Through and Go In.

Stopped for lunch a few weeks ago and made the mistake of going through the drive through. Once you're in the line, you're essentially trapped and it moves at a snails pace. Took 20 minutes for serve six cars.

On the other hand, there is a large lot that you go through before you get to the Drive Through Line.  Park here and walk in because on a subsequent visit, I found that that was much faster.

Food is good but they still have a few start up issues to work out. They have only been open for less than a month now and they are learning."}
{"text":"As we sit in the drive thru, still waiting after 15-18 minutes, I ask myself...\"How high can they possibly be?\" Food is always good, very nice staff, but seriously...it's precooked roast beef. Wtf takes so long?"}
{"text":"I just found 4 hairs in my sandwich.  4.  I can't eat it.  So now I have no lunch.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Arby's and love their food. The location in Fountain Hills is very disappointing. The staff will not deviate slightly and make it your way (to steal Burger Kings saying). I just don;t know why they can't serve it the way I want it. Also, the sound system is shot and is all distorted. Very annoying just turn it off if it does not work right. I will still go to Arby's but when in Fountain Hills (where I live) I will hit the Wendy's next to Arby's for my cravings."}
{"text":"Weird to write a review for fast food? I don't think so, when it's deserved! The staff was crazy friendly, made us hot cakes fresh and told us why we were waiting! Love fresh cut roast beef too!"}
{"text":"Any one waiting on food now is because the guy taking your order is over here at sonic. Lol no wonder they are slow. I am at sonic next door again and the guy from Arby's is bringing food over to someone eating at sonic. You will be waiting on your food again."}
{"text":"Until yesterday, I had not been to an Arby's in awhile. Not that I dislike them, I just don't eat out much.

But let me tell you, the new slider sandwiches they have are delicious!. I purchased 2 of the jalapeno/roast beef sliders.  They were hot and steamy.  And man are the jalapenos HOT!. These will set your mouth on fire.  Just the way I like them.  If you don't care for jalapenos they have a very nice variety of other slider combinations that do not have jalapenos.

The dinner roll buns that the sliders are made on are so soft and fresh.  They melt in your mouth.  And don't forget to add a little of Arby's horsey sauce. Absolutely delightful.

Stop in to an Arby's and try one for yourself.  They're very inexpensive and just the right size for when you're feeling hungry but don't want to stuff yourself.

2 thumbs up for the nice people working at the Mentor Reynolds Rd location!"}
{"text":"Abysmal service. A couple weeks, my husband went through the drive thru and got two meals. He mentioned that the wait was at least 10 minutes. When he got home we realized they only gave us one thing of fries when he paid for two. I called the store and their solution was for us to drive back and they would give us a free turnover. I told him this would not work for us as my baby was asleep. I asked for coupons instead. He took down my information. No coupons were sent. No one from corporate nor a manager contacted me. I even did the phone survey and asked to be contacted and didnt receive a call back. We definitely not be back to this location (chronically understaffed with long wait times) and probably will find alternatives to Arbys in the future due to the lack of response from corporate."}
{"text":"Arby's is an old favorite. The market fresh sandwiches are awesome. But it's their curly fries that bring me back. If you want something different for fast food not the same old burger joint give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great new place! The decor is modern and fresh with plenty of seating. The staff was friendly and got my order out really quickly. I will definitely be telling my co-workers to take this quick walk for a decent well priced lunch! Look for coupons."}
{"text":"Seems kind of rediculous to write a review to a fast food chain, but this store is top-shelf. I'm in here all the time because I believe their delightful service and unbeatable food puts them above all other Arby stores. They really care about the everyday customer and treat us like Guests rather than consumers. The food has always come out fresh and hot every single time consecutively. Something I can't say about other Arbys. The food literally sells itself. The arby's sauce is to die for and the stations are super clean and well kept. I love getting my sauce from a clean counter, it really makes all the difference with my appetite. 

My favorite meal: Two 5 piece chicken tenders (yes, 10 tenders) with I kid you not 10 sides of Arby Sauce. One per tender. I'm in great shape and find that eating 10 tenders per visit will not hurt your body and provides perfect macros for a high protein high card low fat diet. Did i mention the sauce cancels any cravings for dessert? 

Arby's has blown me away, and I will always recommend this location over all others. They're a step ahead from the pack. Go here and be forever happy."}
{"text":"The absolute slowest fast food in Las Vegas!!!!! They are so rude here and extremely slow. It's worth the drive somewhere else. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I eat at Arby's a lot. I have been to a number of different locations and out of all the ones I have been to. This one has always come out on top on all counts food, customer service, accuracy and speed of service."}
{"text":"Food and service was much better then my last vist. Staff were very out going and frindly food was made right and was very fresh. I was very impressed on the change they did restore my fath."}
{"text":"Went thru drive thru and placed order with coupons. They wouldn't honor the coupon because it wasn't on the register. Ok so enter it manually. She didn't know how to do it. Ok so call the manager, umm, she doesn't know how to do it either. Ok, so we change our order, but they accepted the other coupon we had for the mozzarella sticks and jalapeño poppers. We were hungry and the coupon situation didn't stop us from ordering what we wanted but it's frustrating to know that even managers aren't trained appropriately. Arby's #7781 order #316 on September 8 at 18:25 on Reg 4, Merci."}
{"text":"A 15 minute wait to drive through window pretty much invalidates your status as \"fast food\" I could have been served at a sit down restaurant and be done eating by now."}
{"text":"WOW! I was first impressed with Arbys score which is a 99!  That's great for fast food!! My second impression was how clean this Arby's is... even the bathroom was clean! If I was not a such rush, I would have sat down and ate my lunch. 

The cashier was really nice. They use your first name, so when your food is done they will call the name you gave them. 

NOW.... the only thing was my fish sandwich was not fresh. You can tell by the bun and the cheese(which was melted like it was put in the microwave to make it hot again). The fries was fresh and hot"}
{"text":"I have been going to this Arby's for sometime now and have to say the customer service has been poor. But last night that changed for me. Me and my woman wanted to get some Arby's since we haven't gone Their for a bit due to the wait and customer server we get threw the drive threw. Scott took our order and answered every question I asked with great customer service skills. And the wait this time was very short we were really impressed by this young man and his great customer service skills. Will be back during this time more often."}
{"text":"The service and cleanliness of this location is always top notch, and food at this location is always great. When the ONE time I received a wrong order, they quickly corrected it. Thanks to the manager, Chris, and his staff!"}
{"text":"My favorite Arby's I have been going here for years and I never got a bad meal out of this spot and they're always friendly.  I tried the brisket sandwich for the first time and I was pleased with it. They make sure the sweet tea is on the money every time!  A must  spot that I have to hit whenever I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I was not going to review but I have to.   I rolled up to the window and saw the person making my phone with one hand making my food and another hand on his phone.  Then he went from his phone and touched the bread to make the sandwich with his bare hands.  I don't mind but that is a health code violation.
  I was not going to review that. But today I went to go order a buffalo chicken slider and onion rings.... and I tried asking for an iced tea but then I heard the guy laughing in the background. I waited for a good 30 seconds with no response after I said \"can I have an ice tea.\"
  Then he eventually says OK one onion ring and one jalapeño slider.!¿. 
  It was obvious he was not paying attention to my order so why have this guy at the cash register. Whoever does the training at this location is not doing a very good job.   Not only did he get my order wrong,but I had to repeat myself and said I wanted a nice tea multiple times because he was not paying attention.  I'm OK with laughing at work but this guy was being an immature douche bag.  Bad staff, bad customer service, bad training..

Go to Jack-in-the-Box across the street, they seem to have good managers and good training.  Much better health code rating too."}
{"text":"Would've rather marked this as zero stars, but I didn't have the option. Probably the rudest people in Chardon. We walked into the building, signs said they would close at 11pm. At this time, it was before 10pm. A guy rushed towards us from the counter area - before we were even fully in the building, he grabbed the door while we were still holding it open -- as if we walked in on them something wrong.. he yelled, \"we're closed!\".. we had stated that the door said 11pm.. it was still way early compared to that. He then stated \"yeah.. the drive through\". Okay... you could've approached the situation in a better way. Probably could've did a lot of things different.. Maybe taken our order anyways? Instead.. we left, while he muttered comments behind us, \"that's fine\". They rushed to lock all the doors and turn off the dining room lights while we got back in our cars. We will never return. As one of the few fast food chains in Chardon, this was one of our favorites. Never again. They should probably check their attitudes and put up signs or change their hours listed on the doors. Highly disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Poor Service. Drove up to the drive through and had to wait 3 minutes before they would even talk to me. Another 8 minutes just to get my food. Of course I came at 9 pm so everyone was tired and annoyed so I will probably come back just during the day."}
{"text":"Since they fixed the seating area up I like this location. Service seems quick and friendly ."}
{"text":"This location is being updated right now. The whole building is being re done. It is going no towards a modern look compared to its previous older style!"}
{"text":"What can I say, it's an Arby's?  Not my favorite fast food place to eat, but I can tolerate it.  After a long road trip back to the city I needed to find a place to grab a quick bite to eat.  After stopping and getting my other half, he suggested we come here.

I thought to myself, if anything else, I would get myself a double order of the curly fries and be done with it.  I knew I liked them.  Service was fast, we were like the only ones in here on a late Wednesday, so that made for fast, freshly made food.

I however did not just get the curly fries.  I got myself the turkey gyros.  It tasted fresh and wasn't as bad as a greasy burger from other nearby fast food places.  All in all, it wasn't as bad as I though it was going to be."}
{"text":"Worst arbys ever... not only do they never understand what you order they also mess up your food very frequently. On top of all that the drive thru is the slowest I have ever seen, even when there's only a couple cars it takes a good 15 minutes to get thru... avoid this one at all cost!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, the drive thru took over 20 minutes to get my food, they were out of turnovers and the staff seems like they can't handle pressure, just plain bad"}
{"text":"Their beef n cheddar melts yummmmmm! Plus I love how they never mess up my order. Nothing sadder than going home and finding you're missing something, or got the wrong item."}
{"text":"I'm at work, my friend ran to grab us lunch from your store.  The latest he would have arrived at your place was 10:30 am, you open at 10 am. He got 2 fish sandwiches, 1 a deluxe for me and a regular for him.  Not only did this Arby's say the deluxe wasn't included in the 2 for $5 offer ( I've gotten them at 3 other locations where they are included) but the cheese was dried out and friggin HARD like it had been sitting for HOURS!!!! You were only open a half hour, was this a sandwich from yesterday?
I've included a picture of this HORRABLE sandwich and I'm writing corporate too.
I paid for a product I couldn't....WOULDN'T feed my dog.  Bad form Arby's."}
{"text":"Worst Arby's. Don't come to this one!!!!! Cheese wasn't even melted, chicken was burnt. Was way too hard. Overall just bad. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It's just an arby's but I love how casual and comfortable the staff is;    makes me feel comfortable like I'm eating with friends.       Weird eh?   Fuck it,  five star arby's."}
{"text":"Love this Arby's. The food is always hot and fresh. The staff is very friendly and efficient. The inside is very clean and updated!"}
{"text":"Do yourselves a favor and stay away from this location. Horrible customer service the woman working the drive-through was obnoxious and nasty kept asking me if I was done ordering, which by the way it was only one meal plus a side I felt very rushed and her tone was extremely rude. I pulled around and parked went inside to speak to the manager and she just smirked at me and rolled her eyes! My blood was boiling at this point and the manager did not care whatsoever will never ever come back to this location and to the woman at that drive-through learn some respect do you even know what that means? And to the manager learn how to manage employees!"}
{"text":"I love Arby's. I really do. It wasn't my fav growing up but for some reason while I was deployed for a year to Iraq in 2004, I dreamed about roast beef & cheddar sandwiches constantly. When I got home, I think I ate there every day for 2 weeks - it may have been longer.

Unfortunately, I have to give this particular franchise 1 star. The service is achingly slow and they appear constantly understaffed and overwhelmed. I don't understand how because other fast food chains seem to have similar volume in the area and wait times are not 20-30 minutes of sitting in the drive-thru line.  Yes, you will waste some gas going to this location.  If you're thinking Arby's, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Typical Arby's fare. Although the sandwiches here are smaller than other arby's restaurants. I noticed because my last regular was mostly bun. My potato cakes are often stale and old. Makes me sad. Too bad its the only Arby's close to work."}
{"text":"Imagine another negative review for this location.

The Curly fries were cold, The diet coke was flat, and the ad I am subjected to 50 times a day was not honored at this location. 

Companies should hire someone to read the reviews and address the issues. Needless to say my poor GF didn't want get forced in to 2 combo meals so she opted to just get an order of fries. Well it was unfair and when I realized the she did not one I threw mine in the trash. I will never know if they are any good because I will not go back. Now we are going to drive over to Gyro Time on Charleston and go where we know we will get what is advertised and at a fair price."}
{"text":"Since I just reviewed a fast food place I am not fond of, I wanted to give some kudos to a place I absolutely love... ARBYS!  Yes, the food is a little pricier than some fast food places - but I loveee the selection here.  Curly fries?  Jamocha shakes? Chicken cordon blue?  THAT is my kind of Friday night dinner.  Throw in all the condiments not offered elsewhere and the friendly workers and clean restaurant here at this location... and the fact that they NEVER mess up my order - you get the best rating possible.  :)"}
{"text":"How do you get better then a good Arby's ?
Always clean people very helpful.  Menu keeps getting better"}
{"text":"I tried the smokehouse brisket with curly fries and a large drink. The combo price listed on the board and the total amount seemed very far apart. Anyhow the food was out quickly. I went and sat down and began eating. The fries were initially hot but got cold quickly. The sandwich was cold from the get go. It was pretty tasty but it was still cold. The restaurant has a pleasant ambiance inside and it was very clean. The staff was very polite. I will probably eat here again if I have a hankering for fast food."}
{"text":"Arby's is supposed to bring it! last couple times I have purchased a rueben it's been decent. This usually comes with a decent amount of meat and sauerkraut and tasty sauce. today we got the standard 3.5 oz looking like two tiny slabs of meat with a pinch of sauerkraut and a squirt of sauce for a Grand Total of 15.67 dollars for two sands and and one fry with a soda is ridiculous overcharge. Neither sandwich was toasted or tasted right. i have been a long time fan of Arby's and I will not eat here again if this is how they make their sandwiches. Skip Arby's for market fresh or Rueben sandwiches, treat yourself and drive a few more blocks and hit up the Jason's Deli do yourself that favor. You get 7 ounces of meat there compared to the 3.5. Basically you get what you pay for at Jason's deli and the taste is ten times better you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Arby's because I enjoy their Reuben Sandwich and their Turkey Sandwich. It's a chill place with just the right A/C setting. I usually catch up on my reading during lunch so this place ticks all the right boxes in that regard.

My major gripe about this Arby's is in their haste to always upsell you they charge you more than what you order. I upgrade my drink size but it doesn't mean I want their gigantic curly fries. I finally had to read the riot act today and spell it out for them. Many years ago you would get a print out receipt of every item you ordered. These days you get the total you were charged on your credit card but you don't have any idea if you were charged correctly on each item.

So even though I still like you Arby's, I'm not ringing that bell."}
{"text":"Arby's has stepped up their game. Chain haters need not apply, you bore me.

 I usually get the Turkey Sandwich with the spicy mustard, lettuce, tomatoes and onions along with those yummy curly fries.

 But the belle of the ball is the recently introduced Double Reuben Sandwich which is garnished with the traditional fixings of sauerkraut and thousand island dressing. This sandwich is head and shoulders above any of the local NY deli spots in the area. The meaty Reuben combo will set you back about $9.61.

The manager is always there making sure that all the customers are happy. My only gripe is the constant up-selling by the cashiers. I love going here to read my paper and chill. There's plenty of elbow room and a bell to ring when you walk out the door if you want to voice your satisfaction with the food and service. I don't ring the bell, I just UFC."}
{"text":"Slow as heck!! But food is ok. Don't be in a hurry. They are out catching your food to serve. And portions are not consistent and frys are cold. You have to request \"fresh\" and they have you pull up. Hey its fresh! If they would pay employees more. They might get decent help."}
{"text":"Came in for some delicious dinner tonight. Had such an amazing experience. The drive thru boy Zack was really awesome!. Nice. Fast and friendly... good team on the clock tonight was slighty busy but they nailed it! I will be coming back to this specific location since I received top notch service... Thanks Arbys"}
{"text":"Yo , seriously . What is this ? They're just like whatever who cares I have no integrity . They handed us the most cold regular fries of all time , when we specifically ordered Curly fries . Asked for the curly fries and got static off of it . Got home and seen this well done bun on the jr roast beef . Cmon . Its totally burnt to a crisp . It's just sad . It's too bad this is the only location anywhere near our home . Terrible service and food was no Bueno as well . Be advised . Be very specific when ordering and make sure the sassy chick working drive through understands you decently ."}
{"text":"I just love this Arby's!  My daughter has a serious food allergy and they are always so accommodating! They change their gloves before making my daughter's sandwich and customize her order. Surprisingly, this is one of the few places we trust for her to eat. Very clean location and great service too!"}
{"text":"The remodeling is done. The place looks great. Food here has always been and still is great. Staff is friendly.  If you're a carnivore and love a great sandwich come here."}
{"text":"The first thing you experience here is clean.  Clean clean clean. Clean.  Almost hospital sterile.  This is the way fast food is supposed to be.  \"Yes sir, no sir\" and smiles.   Manager on duty is up front, clean, shirt tucked in, on the front line.  They take your name, call you by name when your food is ready.  Now, it's a fast food place but they took a cue from Chick FilA and they have these \"servers\" that come around, bus your table, refill your drink, bring you ketchup.  I mean, if you want a good turkey on wheat, go here.  It's fresh, the lettuce is not some crap iceberg.  Real lettuce.  Fresh tomatoes.  Overall why the 4 stars?  The place smelled of windex.  Very strong.  Too strong."}
{"text":"Food was not that great! Out of all the Arby's I've went to, this location was by far the worst. First off, my sandwich literally just had 2 pieces of meat. Then the fries I received tasted like they were days old, hard, and stale. I didn't even finish my meal. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I have to point out credit where it is due: to the lady working the drive thru around 4:30 pm today- your attitude rocks! I know how hard it can be to have a job working in a fast food place and it is definitely doubled when working drive thru so when I find someone with an extremely positive and happy attitude I have to point it out! Food was tasty and hot as usual, thank you, and the turnovers were great! I'm glad to find someone with as positive an attitude as yours working in my area! I hope you never lose that calm and competent attitude!"}
{"text":"Food is good like other Arby's, but service is horrible! They always \"Please give me a moment\" which usually means 5minutes, but sometimes means 10+ minutes! If I didn't like Arby's so much I wouldn't return... 
Also found what looked like a pubic hair on a sandwich and emailed Arby's to which I got no reply yet."}
{"text":"There hours for lobby says 10pm but at 9:48p the doors are locked... Fix your sign or your employees this was on Friday November 10. Luckily in-n-out is in the same parking lot an honor there posted hours."}
{"text":"Having a taste for roast beef and a quick lunch after a stressful morning with clients I head over to Arbys where the menu is large with many choices available.  Open the door and Andrea says \"Hi Mark, hows it go'in today\".  Andrea has a smile to die for and all the warmth in her greeting makes my day better.  Place order and within minutes my meal is ready - hot and fresh.  Wow!    What more can you ask for.    Store Mgr. Nolan oversees a staff of dedicated and great customer service oriented associates.  I love this place and Andrea too."}
{"text":"I usually go here when I want a change in food.  Their food is good, I like their fries, and market fresh sandwiches. But of course if all you want is their roast beef! They have quite a bit of different ways to have it. Again, it's not a bad place. I will come back from time to time."}
{"text":"I like Arby's because they are different. Not your burger and fries fast food chain. My favorite is their chicken salad sandwich on wheat. This was an excellent sandwich. As you noticed I said WAS? They have now discontinued this sandwich. i have now noticed their menu is beginning to look like any other fast food chain. Arby's has chicken tenders, and it's not that good. They also now have jalapeno poppers, again not that good. They still have their roast beef selection and it's still and good alternate if your're tired of burgers. 

Now had a very decent experience at this location. Service was very fast, and courteous. Place was very clean. 

I hope Arby's isn't planning to go towards a menu like the other fast food chains. We already have them, be different and give us other options."}
{"text":"Walked in and was overcome by the smell of urine.  Had to leave it was so gross and disgusting."}
{"text":"Quick dinner after climbing with my girlfriend at the nearby Inner Peaks climbing gym.  I got a market fresh sandwich and she got french dip.  No one else was in there on a Monday night, and service was decent (not fast or slow).  The food was good, though they put an excessive amount of ranch on the chicken bacon ranch sandwich I had.  Food is better than most fast food and reasonably quick and clean.  Would visit again when needing a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Don't go there anymore food tasted like they left it out all day yesterday microwaved it then served it to you with drink and fries"}
{"text":"Its Arby's. Not quite sure if it warrants a review. Cause if your old enough to read and understand this, you probably have shoved quite a bit of Arby sandwiches down your throat. If you haven't but you can read and understand this. Then your probably new to this country. In that case welcome to the USA! And try the roast beef french dip or market fresh sandwiches at Arby's. Its some pretty good fast food."}
{"text":"The kid at the counter needs to learn to balance taking orders and filling orders. The food was stacking up. And he kept taking orders. When he got around to filling the orders. He was mixing things up. They lost my order and had to remake it."}
{"text":"I do love Arby's food.  This location seems to have a bun masher or something cause my buns are always flat for some reason.   I just can't explain it... weird!

I have only gone through the drive thru.  This has always been fast and easy transactions.  Employees are the window seem to be cheerful. 

Their seasoned curly fries are super yummy! 

I do think their prices are a little high though.  Yes it is good but the price I can get more else where and be more full filling.  I do come here to treat myself and get a nice cold milkshake."}
{"text":"New blt is fantastic, staff is great. Place is clean. His area tends to have a heavy transient population butthey seem to stay across he road"}
{"text":"Thanks Arby's, You made a mistake with my order then when you found out that it was wrong you made it right by replacing the entire order the next day without being asked. The food is great and the kitchen is clean"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This Arbys ticked me off so bad, crap food, crap service and disgusting facility. Read on.

First off the gas station and area around this Arby's is always dirty, why? Trash cans overflowing with garbage. Oil stains on the parking lot surface. Yuck. I was hungry and had stopped by Menards just down the road, so I figured get some grub here. 

Let me say, smile folks, it doesn't hurt. They all look like pathetic little pissed off workers who hate their jobs. The sandwiches we ordered were complete crap here. Soggy buns, half warm fries. Cheese sauce that seemed half warm, really? 

I will never go back to this Arby's. 


PS. To the person that owns this property, CLEAN IT UP, NOW!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This Arby's is close to work for me. I like stopping here for lunch or even a late night snack. The guys have always been really nice when ever heading in for a meal. Always thank me by name. Food always delivered fresh and common areas always well kept. Good food, standard Arby's prices and great customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped by on our drive home from MN. Clean restaurant and clean bathrooms. Food is just like any Arby's you go to. We tried the gyro fries and actually really liked it. Definitely a recommended item if you like gyro's"}
{"text":"Intended to stop in at the Wendy's at this shopping center, but it is gone and a Bosa doughnut place has taken over that building. I have never been in this Arby's before, but it looks and feels like every other one I have been in.
My 7 year old grandson got the chicken fingers, curly fries, and a chocolate shake. I got the grown up version of the same thing. He also got a 3D shark puzzle with his kids meal. Hey, no fair, I didn't get one of those. :- (
The food was OK, the store was clean, parking was close to the door."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this Arbys another chance. We usually get the French Dip with Swiss sub without the au jous and we usually order it with double meat (they normally charge $1 more per sandwich to do this).  It is a great way to keep the carb count down and still feel full. We were told on this visit that they could no longer do the extra meat because someone has removed the button on the cash register to charge the $1 extra per sandwich. REALLY??? With everyone from diabetics to Atkins dieters counting carbs these days, it is very short-sighted to eliminate this option.
If we want a roast beef sandwich in the future we will just buy the beef from a BBQ place like Dave's, Tom's Andrew's or Honey Bear's and make the sandwiches up at home.
We will NOT be returning to Arbys."}
{"text":"worst arbys location. a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait. it never fails. now if we didnt have places to be we would have gone inside and ordered our food and waited. they said they wanted the food to be fresh but 15 minutes later? really? in a drive thru? i think i will be going some place else next time. if anyone decides to go for some fast food here be sure to eat inside otherwise you will sit around out front waiting for just a \"few moments\" (but really 15 plus minutes) for your \"fresh\" food."}
{"text":"I worked in fast food during high school and college and the job entails two main tasks, prompt customer service and making sure the food comes out correctly (everything else is mostly automated).  This particular Arby's location fails on both points."}
{"text":"I was hungry after purchasing a cat tree for Christmas, I ordered Cheddar melts and Buffalo spicy sandwich and they were both delicious. Service was friendly and prices normal . I really enjoyed the sea salt cookie they have. It is spectacular!"}
{"text":"I give the service 5 stars because they give you sauces without complaints besides good manners. I will give the Arby Cheddar Melts 4 stars as they need sauce to be really tasty as most fast food places do in US. The loaded fries were ok but get cool quickly and Cherry Turnover 5 stars. They honor coupons here if you are trying to save a little as well."}
{"text":"If you're pressed for time, don't even bother. Luckily, I wasn't in any hurry. Came in on a Sunday afternoon. There were 2 guys that had already ordered waiting for their food. I was able to order right away at 12:18. I ordered a straightforward beef and cheddar meal and I waited. And I waited. And I waited. I finally got my food at 12:40. Glad I wasn't in a hurry or I'd be pretty upset."}
{"text":"I just came in today and ordered a \"Jamocha\" shake with other items, receiving a Vanilla shake with my other food. I'm very frustrated, as I was really craving that shake and I hate vanilla. I feel like this could become more and more of a problem since those two words \"Jamocha\" and \"Vanilla\" sound similar, especially in drive thru. Other than that, I'm glad I received everything else I ordered at least with more than just one sauce packet."}
{"text":"I should have known better, but let's say I held out hope for the new Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and was very disappointed. The sandwich looked nothing like the sign (which is typical) but the chicken was dry and over cooked, the patty was no where near the size of the bun let alone \"bigger then the bun\" as advertised. 
I generally don't like fast food for the most part and I've been disappointed with Arby's specifically for some time now. I won't be back for a while if ever."}
{"text":"The people here obviously don't know how to make a Reuben sandwich. I've came here multiple times and I feel like they keep getting lazier and lazier with making my sandwiches. And they keep getting my order wrong most of the time. There's a girl with blonde hair who works there mostly at nights who is extremely rude. I came here like 15 minutes to closing and she just kept rushing us the whole time. I was nice to here of course so she wouldn't try to spit in my food secretly."}
{"text":"Ordered the new Nashville hot fish kings Hawaiian deluxe sandwich got the regular one instead when I was on my lunch break. I called to confirm the price and the manager Ray said it was the same price. How are they charging the same price for a sandwich that has better bread ranch sauce cheese and tomatoes. That is completely untrue so not only was I overcharged I am also disappointed that he didn't take proper measures to correct the issue. I'll most likely go back but it's ridiculous that I will have to open every sandwich moving forward to make sure it's correct."}

{"text":"I love the new look of the Arby's in Monroeville! Clean, fresh and new ! 
Our family has always loved the roast beef sandwiches and at times this location has always been convenient when out and about. 
I never cared to eat inside, but I will now! 
I have never had a problem with service or the food. It was always the dining room was unclean and a mess. 
I can't say that any longer. All new seats and a fresh new look. 
Give this location another chance. 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I never was a big fan of this chain, but found myself pleasantly surprised with this one. The signs on the window for a really big fish fillet was the lure..  Their fish sandwich is spectacular. Large, hot and succulent. They will see me again...."}
{"text":"If I could have a 0! Collins, was the name I was given. He was apparently the mod, he was so so so so rude to the two girls that were working that I canceled a 36$ order. I couldn't stand there and let him talk to them while they ran ragged, and worked so hard! Go ladies! Find another job that you don't get treated like that!"}
{"text":"It's Arby's what do you expect.

It's Arby's, so either you like it or not. As for me, I will take a pass for future lunch decisions.  There really is not much quality in this market.  But, if I have to have fast food, you can do worse then  Arby's.  On a positive note, Arby's usually get my order correct  and they offer some not to greasy options.  I particularly like the beef and cheddar, which is a little better than most offering as a drive through.  

The beef and cheddar sandwich was hot and fresh and what you would  expect  from an Arby's. However, my fries were  cold,  tasteless, an old as if they've were sitting there for quite a while

 The customer service was fine but the closing of the store wasn't entirely diffrent issue. The  restrooms were filthy, as were the floors and condiment area. I'm definitely not in a rush to revisit any time soon."}
{"text":"very friendly people, fast service, and staff that go that extra mile (offering to bring your food to your table, to clear your tray, etc). My only complaint: the teeny-bopper radio selection. The food is standard Arby's fare, good"}
{"text":"Arby's is always awesome, this location is in the heart of the St. Rose/Eastern huge shopping area that covers pretty much every dining and minor shopping option you can think of.

Little disappointed in the service time, obviously it's considered a fast food place, but this was the opposite of fast. There was a mini rush right before we went in tonight, and usually you can get your food in about 3-4 minutes. Tonight took over 10-12 minutes and there were only two small families in front of us, and what upset me the most was that a lady and her son that came in right after we ordered (finally) and got their food before the family in front of us. How does that make sense? From listening in and knowing what me and my lady got, none of us ordered any special items. Hell, pretty much all you can get is roast beef sandwiches and french fries, their menu is not that extensive. 
Food was on par, the sandwiches are what I expect and we destroyed us some arby sauce. I'm sure it was just a minor problem that tonight went so poor, but hey I review my experience. If I go back and it's better or worse I'll then update"}
{"text":"The staff was so exceptionally nice! I just wanted to take a minute and say thank you! Amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about my experiences here.  Food's usually good but the staff has been hit or miss and I'm not sure its worth the price."}
{"text":"going through the reviews I realized that everyone has the same complaint that I do. Miles NEEDS a new personality!!!"}
{"text":"Ive never been at this location, but i love Arbys. The staff was considerate and actually quite timely with our order, i was impressed with the young lead that was running her shift. She was on top of things, something you dont sew anymore, younger generation caring about what they do while at work, thats a rant for different times and media."}
{"text":"I am a long time Arbys customer and ex-employee, two stars has nothing to do with Arbys itself, it's this particular location.  It needs a major face lift to start, the bathrooms are outside in a dark back door area. The floors look like they tried to mop them and they used a dirty mop and water. The staff is not the friendliest. Everyone there seem to have an attitude, including, what I'm assuming is the manager. The only complaint against the organization itself, you should've had the special venison sandwiches advertised better, had sandwiches available longer. I understand the 2 person customer bit, that's not a problem. Otherwise this locale is not to be desired."}
{"text":"Well I grew up going and working at this location. I'm in my mid 40s, if that helps you with a time frame, usually good service, today was one exception, service was outstanding. Feeding a family of with three grown men, a petite mid 20 woman and a growing 3rd grader, no one behind a counter wants an order like that. 9 regulars, three large fries and 4 shakes. Got it all exactly correct hot and with a smile. Oh all for under $40. They were short handed and busy on top of all that, the best service in a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"It's fast food, but it's consistently good fast food and the level of customer service is way beyond what you normally get at a fast food joint.  Cheers for a job well done."}
{"text":"Yelp shows this location closed today. That is what it felt like going in. The drive thru had a few cars in line so we went in. There was one other customer in line at the register. We stood there for a couple of minutes. We could see someone making food, but nobody acknowledged us. Finally the cook asked for help at the register, but nobody came. I have been to this location one other time and they got my order wrong."}
{"text":"one word... SLOW! 15 minute wait for 2 sandwiches? \"We're all out of turkey\" then \"We're all out of ham\" and I'm all out of patience!"}
{"text":"Arby's always has great good. A little pricey but always delicious. Very good customer service at this location. Food comes out hot and just made...not sitting under the warmer for 10 minutes. Will be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving a fast food place a rating as I never eat fast food but service here was phenomenal the manager was very friendly, accommodating for my order, in the food came out quickly and correctly from the back."}
{"text":"Good roast beef sandwiches and desserts"}
{"text":"I am a care provider for adults with developmental disabilities and we were greeted by a cashier by the name of Shawn who is absolutely the most sweetest and compassionate person I have come across in a very long time she not only went out of her way to make sure that they had everything they wanted but also took time out of her busy schedule to sit down with us for a bit. She looked at them for the human beings they are not for their disability."}
{"text":"Just spent 33 mins stuck in drive thru. All the cars in front of me kept returning their bags for inaccuracy I guess. I finally got up to window and I asked what the problem was.  Answer 

I dunno I'm just collecting ain't making food.  Terrible service today"}
{"text":"Clean as hell, quick service, each sandwich seems fresh and delicious. Recommend highly. Convenient location"}
{"text":"The sandwich was cold.  The cup of ice I ordered was a kids size.  I guess I had to have a gotten a combo to get a 20oz size. Idk. The food was just cold and my fish tasted like it had been sitting for a while. I would have turned around but I was almost on interstate 85.  Too far to turn, too passed to talk about it.....  not stopping there again."}
{"text":"Waited in drive thru FOREVER!!!!  Finally get up to pay and cashier asks us to park our car.  Apparently the 3 cars ahead of us are ALL PARKED waiting for their food too.  Why???  First and LAST time at this location"}
{"text":"My third time ever going to an Arby's , I have to say it wasn't to bad. The food was ok but not bad for a fast food place which is good. The cleanliness wasn't that great but at the time it was raining which could be why. The greasiest thing about it was the customer service which was 100% great. Very friendly people which is super rare for a fast food place but nonetheless it wasn't a bad experience. 

Try the Rueben sand which it's really good."}
{"text":"This was a very poor experience. DO NOT GET THE FRENCH DIP! My boyfriend and I are very very sick from it. Black gunk was on the bottom of the container with the aju sauce. Very disappointing all around. Great service though!"}
{"text":"They are ok here good service food is consistent. Brisket is the best, put a lot of meat on it yummy"}
{"text":"I really love Arby's food. It is super expensive which is a downer but it is a super downer when your order isn't right. I ordered a double beef and cheddar. There was nothing double about it. I also ordered loaded curly fries with NO ranch. They had ranch. I requested a cup of red ranch and didn't get it either. My husband's order was right and I ended up just switching fries with him since he just got plain curly fries. The poor guy taking orders was so timid. I had to repeat my order 3 or 4 times all the while there was someone yelling for him in the back asking questions and then two people about a foot away from him training plus the people in front of us had a hard time ordering too. I felt really bad for him - that's why I didn't bother to take my food back to the front."}
{"text":"How much can you say about a fast food joint?  If the service is good, the floor and bathrooms are clean and the line is not too long- then it's at the top of the list.  This place fits all criteria for a smooth run operation and seems to be pretty consistent over the years."}
{"text":"Consistently the best Arby's and fast food outlet around. Great service with a smile and no issues. Thanks for making a short lunch break easier!"}
{"text":"Not much on fast food, BUT, these guys are on the ball. Great food, great service, great attitude, AND most of all, The 10 commandments hanging on the wall right next to the counter for the world to see! Very refreshing to see! We will be back, and often. BTW, the fish sandwiches are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant has gone down hill so much, but it takes at least 10-20 minutes to even order food sometimes. The managers seem to dodge any conversations with guests, and the food looks questionable each time I've gone."}
{"text":"The lady in the drive thru was very miserable. My husband said thank you a few different times and each time she closed the window on him. And to top it off our order was wrong  even though we were the only ones there"}
{"text":"I tried the bourbon brisket sandwich and the orange cream shake and both were pretty good. The brisket was not chewy and the sauce had the closest authenticity to a real bourbon taste that I've had so far. But the only complaint would be that the sauce needs to be layered between the brisket so that no brisket goes without sauce."}
{"text":"I've always liked Arby's but I went here tonight and the roast beef sandwich was moldy and smelt disgusting. The fries were fine but I couldn't really eat dinner since you guys gave me a moldy sandwich."}
{"text":"It's almost as if this Arby's WANTS to hide in the shadows of neighboring In n Out burger with their bright sign and line of cars past the driveway.  Every time I've been here in the evening it's dark in their lot.  There are no signs for their drive thru.  The only lights I've seen are from the drive thru menu and at the drive thru window.  They needa turn those business lights on - it's spooky.

If it weren't for their hoagy sandwiches I probably wouldn't bother going.  Plus good thing I like their horsey sauce.  And their combos come with curly fries.  Their franchise also carried the Orange Cream milkshake too over the summer.  I like some of their menu items and the drive thru service is quick.  My order has always been correct and they don't forget to gimme napkins :P   Ya' get 3***"}
{"text":"Typical Arby's. But cleaner and more friendly then most. There's not a lot to say. Standard menu but what standards out are the people."}

Pronounced Yeeerow.
Your drive thru kids sound ignorant.
Oh, and try cleaning the snow away from your doorways. Simple yet courteous gesture towards your customers..."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 of the 2 for 6 bacon cheddar and beef.... lady messed up and did plain beef and cheddar so the other lady said she would take care of it... asked what we ordered told her and came home to the wrong freaking food..... no bacon STILL... Called and the lady that answred interuppted me and said here ill give you to so and so..... so i had to re explain the situation agaib and she said \"She didn't hear us say bacon\" 3 times.... had to go back and get the correct food. This is such an inconvenience.... and so rediculous.... Your employees need more training... not coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me???!! The lady at the drive through here didn't want to hand me my drink until I handed her my card! HAHA really??!! My girlfriend was fumbling through her purse to find the debit card and I tried to reach for the drink she was handing me out of the drive through window and she immediately pulled the drink back and said, \" um... How about you pay me first.\" Do I look that untrustworthy? Talk about making a customer feel low! I guess she thought I was going to drive off with a fountain drink and leave the rest of the order... What a joke!"}
{"text":"I love Arby's and was looking to place a large order for quite a bit of people.  The managers attitude (12:50pm on 7/2/17) was short and therefore decided to go elsewhere.  Can't say much other than that... the cashier and manager didn't seem to want to make their company money or take time to listen to their customer.  Customer service score: 2/10... oh well, on to the next place."}
{"text":"WTF, can the people who work here not get anything right. 4 visits in the last month 3 times my order has been wrong. I'm not a math genius but a 75% error rate seems very high. So high in fact I still have \"free\" food waiting for me since they've screwed up my orders so often. Well I'm done, apparently they can't get their shit together  enough to get an order right even when you confirm they understood your order at the window only to get home to find it's wrong. Probably have wasted $1,000 over the lifetime they've screwed up my orders, $10-20 each time adds up over the years. Best part they're always out of beef  at night. Another wtf, can't management get their crap together? Any how it's just fast food, I'll live with out Arbys in my life."}
{"text":"My beef was so raw that I had to put it in the microwave for two minutes. It was even slightly cold before I reheated it. The manager says they cook it medium rare, and I explained it was so rare it ate the lettuce off of the sandwich! 

Neither the brown sugar bacon and beef nor the BLT had much bacon. (How do I post pictures?) For a sandwich advertised to have delicious bacon, this fell WAY short. The little bit of bacon it did have was burnt. Really Arby's? I told the manager I have no idea how they thought sending out a sandwich like that was acceptable.

Overall, this made a horrible day worse. I was celebrating my two oldest girls' graduation from high school, and what was supposed to be a very nice dinner was a disaster. We went to Arby's as a back up so I had at least a little something to eat. That was equally disastrous. At least the fries were okay, albeit a little soft and mushy for some reason. 

Based on this experience, I would not go back. Based on this experience, I would most definitely not recommend this to others."}
{"text":"March 28, 2017: This is an update. I am updating them to 5 stars. I spoke to Helen the manager. Helen took care of the complaint. Per Helen's offer, I ate at this location on March 28, 2017 in the evening. Gina the supervisor was not there because if she was, then I would not go. The employees who were there, were all very nice. I recognized that they all were trying to be helpful and wanted to make sure my order was correct, even the cook in the back. 
This Arbys location deserves 5 stars. Thank you Arbys Las Vegas on Rancho Dr.!"}
{"text":"Whomp! Whomp! Ordered #5 Mid Roast Beef Sandwich combo. Drove home, opened sandwich and bun was too burnt to eat and hard as a rock. Drove back to Arby's and met with Chrisandra (sp?) and asked for a refund (Lost appetite by now). Was told she could only re-make my order or set me up for food at a later date, but NO refund of my measly $9.76. This is not the first time this location has not delivered inedible food, but I assure you it is the LAST!! I am done and not happy that she would not honor a refund. Not Cool"}
{"text":"Entire establishment was very clean including the bathroom.  Great food and fast friendly service at this location..  Will visit this location again."}

{"text":"This particular Arby's is just average....it has a nice staff....and the food is just average as well. Right now there is a promotion going on for there new chicken salad sandwich....and it is just average as well. If you like Roast beef.....and I don't....then this of course is the place for you. The deals they have on roast beef sandwiches are unmatched....but that is about all they can boast about. The curly fries are a must because the regular french fries are again just average. So  I guess I am saying if your looking for average food then come on over to this locale......if not move on but continue to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}

The Grand Turkey Club.....and Turkey n Cheddar Classics are in a word AWESOME!!!!! However....and not to offend you Roast Beef lovers.....The Arby's Market Fresh Turkey Cheddar and Ranch Sandwich may simple be the best Sandwich of it's kind in all of AZ. So if your brave Roast Beef fans....I DARE YOU to try Arby's Turkey and Market Fresh offerings and by all means Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the 10 minute plus wait is unacceptable for a fast food place but what really makes this a 2 star rating is after purchasing a meal and drink through there drive through, I asked the employee through the window if they would throw away a cup I had from a previous visit with them. The gentleman said no he didnt have a garbage can close to him.  Say what?  Customers pay your check and when we stop coming, who will pay you then?  Poor customer service."}
{"text":"This location has the really cool original Arby's sign and I have given it several chances because I want it to be good. I love Arbys,however this location sucks! They gave me a flat soda to wash down my cold beef & cheddar. I do drive thu and eat and drive. This has happened one to many times. I will be eating something els and I just want others to know."}
{"text":"Best 2 for $5.00 Fish anywhere and this location is fast and courteous!!!!
If I eat fast food it's gonna be fish, still not REALLY good for you but it  sure beats the crap out of that crap Mcpuke call fish...
Guuuh...Their fish have gone so far down hill in recent years that I can now say without abandon that I have NO REASON EVER to eat there..."}
{"text":"I gave one star because you can't give none!! The manager, Mary Figerarro was mean to me, she yelled at me and told me I was wrong because I wanted a sandwich that was cooked!! And continued to show her attitude problem about me having a different opinion about how done the roast should be cooked!!!!  I asked for a refund and she yelled at me again because I took my receipt!!!  She is a raging witch!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so it's a fast food place.  Doesn't matter if the food is better than most fast food joints. I like the fresh potato cakes with horsey sauce. Much better than others French fries."}
{"text":"Whoever is working the drive through is awful. I reversed out rather than spend my money in a place that can't even train their barely literate staff to be polite. No hello, no welcome just an \"order when ready\" with a bad attitude. Then an annoyed \"I can't hear you\". Whoever is was was obviously flustered from having to tear themselves away from their cell phone and actually attend to 3 whole customers in line."}
{"text":"In town for a funeral, got such bad food poisoning that I missed the funeral. Not only did the food make me sick, I had ordered the French dip and didn't even get the dip"}
{"text":"The most incompetent staff ever. Been there twice to get beef n cheddars both time they were wrong. One had bacon I didn't ask for and this time it didn't have any of the sauce on it. Guess they don't know what a fucking beef n cheddar is. Never coming back to this one. Fuck em!"}
{"text":"Every time I have been in here I have been treated well. The crews are always talkative and nice. The manager Beth Anderson is always so nice. The other managers are great too. Never had one bad order over here."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been to this location. Fool me twice, shame on me right? This visit we didn't have to wait in the drive thru for 20 minutes for food. However the food I did recieve was cold and hard as if it had been made hours earlier. Next time I'm ignoring the craving for curly fries."}
{"text":"This place is Arby's, yes sure just like any other, no!

Best Arbys I have been to in this area and will continue to go to, employees are very attentive, food is good, is the only Arbys I will use in this area!"}
{"text":"Ordered the classic beef sandwich and Arby fries to go. The roast beef was typical Arby's, not much flavor (almost like it was boiled). The fries were terrible, over cooked and greasy. Won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"Really good location in Gilbert. Went there around 8 p.m. I went through the drive-thru. Service was quick and fast. Cashier was nice.

I had the double roast beef with cheddar sandwich with the coupon.
As good as of quality that you'll get from a Arby's.

Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Bob's review nailed it. 

Service 5 stars, they had my food ready before my drink was filled. Now that sounds like a bad thing... right? NOPE

Fresh as can be. The frys were hot, the bread was soft and the beef was not rubber. 

Great place to eat."}
{"text":"I have to comment on this Arby's. Every time I come here, I am struck by how spotlessly clean it is--from the front to the kitchen area. The food is also hot and fresh and the employees are friendly and good at their jobs. The manager here is obviously doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches and they don't skimp on the meat like most other Arbys. Got the new Turkey, Bacon, Avocado sandwich...plenty of real sliced turkey 4 strips of bacon, mayo and lettuce w/tomato. Excellent!"}
{"text":"This location was a disappointment because I love Arby's. We used the drive-thru and waited longer then I would have thought (I didn't keep track of how long) especially being the only car at the time. Ordered a few sandwiches large and small. Both of the Jr. Sandwiches were not good at all one had a stale bun and the other not only had that issue but the roast beef was a hard texture. I would have thought that the sandwiches were being made fresh but I was wrong. The employees were friendly and I didn't have time to go back and complain in person (hence the convince of using the drive-thru) or I would have been able to have the sandwiches fixed.
The good part it my sandwich (regular full size one) and patato cakes (I guess what took the time to make fresh) were great as usual. 
I guess what I am saying is, if your kids are hungry go elsewhere. If your dog is looking for a treat grab him a Jr. Sandwich from this Arby's."}
{"text":"I freakin love Arby's, but this has to be the worst one in town! Every time I go to this one, something is messed up or forgotten. Missing sauces/dressing, charged for a beef and cheddar, but no cheddar, cold fries, mozzarella sticks overcooked so it's just a hollow tube of breading, wrong drinks, etc. This place is only worth it since it is the closest Arby's for my roast beef cravings. Management needs to do something!"}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible! We had a coupon to use and when we handed it to the girl at the window, she angrily started LECTURING us that we should always mention we have coupons when we are initially ordering our meal. She then proceeded to rant that this is common curtesy to the person working the register and should be mentioned prior to getting to the window at ALL fast food joints, not just Arby's. Her snippy attitude and disrespectful comments (provoked from a coupon?!) honestly makes me wonder what standards this place has to qualify to work here.

On top of all this, we actually did mention the coupon while ordering, but because their drive thru speaker is somewhat broken, I had to repeat the order numerous times and I am doubtful the person receiving the orders even heard. The food and shakes were average at best. Don't come here unless you enjoy because yelled at by rude employees. Lol, NOT worth my time and patience- never returning!"}
{"text":"Service always seems kinda slow here but the food when it Arrives is fresh and tastes good....."}
{"text":"I am aware that writing a review on the Eaton Centre Arbys may, for some, greatly deplete the value (especially given the significant portion of foodies on yelp) of all my past or future reviews. However, I feel the need to express what I think is so great about the Arbys (specifically the roast beef sandwich) in an attempt to redeem myself ;) and any other shameful yelper of having the same guilty pleasure. Here are some of the things, that for me, make Arbys so great:
1. Sometimes you're at the mall and you don't feel like a burger, but you still want something fast and dirty. Arbys has mastered the (seemingly) only dirty fast-food sandwich option at the food court. But you never feel totally full with just one (which probably has something to do with the fact that the meat is not actually meat). This, I argue, is not a negative thing. Because when eating Arbys, one can take pleasure in that fact that once you are done eating one sandwich, it's not necessarily over. There is still possibly  more (and more?) goodness to come. Yes more. As Arbys, aware of this fact, offers special sandwich deals in multiples of 5 (5!) every few months. 
2. The horsey sauce. I've tried to mimic this part mayo part horseradish concoction at home, but have never come close to getting it right. And a quick (admittedly disturbing) google search for the 'Arbys horsey sauce recipe' proves many other people have attempted this at home as well. So I suggest (not only trying) but stealing packets the next time you go, and putting the sauce on anything and everything for the following week. 
3. It's mall food, which I believe is always a guilt free consumption. This is cause one rarely feels guilty making a 10$ purchase at the food court after spending 300$ on clothes. It's also a guilt free because you feel like you've physically earned it....this may have something to do with the fact that trekking back and forth, up and down through the mounds of people frequenting the Eaton Centre on a Friday night to look for something to wear to the bar you're being forced to go to by your friends later that night is a experience I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy, and one deserving compensation."}
{"text":"Sliders are unbelievably good here. You can't go wrong with any of them! Would recommend the sliders 100%. Great spot for late night munchies"}
{"text":"I'm a die-hard Arby's fan. Came here on way to beach for the classic roast beef sandwich. They didn't let me down. Was awesome.

Arby's fans are a unique breed. You don't want to know how far I have driven to et an Arby's roast beef sandwich."}
{"text":"One star for doing renovations and not marking the drive thru that the restaurant is closed during construction... (since this business is unclaimed on Yelp I'm sure I'm speaking into a black hole..)."}
{"text":"As Arby's go, this one is a bit above the rest. The manager clearly keep s a positive work environment which means people actively doing their job and making a pleasant experience for the customers. The food is always on that \"pretty good\" side of what fast food can be."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try the new Grilled Chicken Salad Sandwich it was good however the drive thru speaker needs to be updated because the guy taking me order could not hear me and I had to yell (not good). I have also had the Fish Fillet sandwich here and it was good too; it has been years since I had one of their beef sandwiches and I don't think I can eat one now that I know what a good Roast Beef sandwich taste like. But their Market Place options are quite tasty give them a try."}
{"text":"I usually love Arby's but last Saturday, they completely forgot my order.  I was told to sit down and wait for my name to be called but as the people who were behind me in line all got their food, my name had still not been called. When I asked about my food, again there was no rush to find my order...and I was already late back to work. Very disappointed in the service but the food was still good!"}
{"text":"All the Time i go there with my Dad And they always have lovely samdwhiches there! One Time i went there as usual, And For dessert I ordered Oreo bites which they Said they Didnt have but gave me a free double chocolate chip cookie which was delicious."}
{"text":"I've seen some pretty harsh reviews about this location that frankly I don't understand. I did have to wait 5 minutes for my fish sandwich but it was late night, I was told so when ordering and the fish was hot, fresh and delicious. 

I also had a Reuben that was loaded with meat and also fresh and awesome. The service was very friendly and lacking nothing. I was even asked twice if I wanted any sauces. Well done night crew!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I will avoid this location forever. First they allow me to order a chocolate turnover but don't have any. We waited 10 minutes (in the drive-thru) for the order. While sitting in the car we noticed a foul sewer/sulfur smell. Had to roll up the windows!! Then finally getting our order the cheese on the slider wasn't even melted. Handed it back to the employee and all she did was have someone put it in the microwave wtf (I could of done that) I wasn't given a receipt, so I can't call and complain. When we got home to eat we noticed the new brisket sandwich was 30% grisly. Yuck! I'm done!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I know its just an Arby's, but I was pretty impressed. The place was clean, fast, and tasty. The side salad was very fresh and crispy. Employees asked how everything was while I was eating too. Great Pepsi soda fountain as well with drinks you don't normally see. Only complaint is the lack of healthier food choices, but yeah, it is an Arby's.
At the exit door, there is a loud bell you can ring if the service was good. When it rings, every employee yells thank you or whistles so that the customer that rang it can hear. I thought it was a nice touch and I rang the bell myself."}
{"text":"Went to get a cookie butter shake they are advertising 2 hours before the location closed, didn't want anything else and they said they couldn't make me a shake because they were cleaning the machine. They wouldn't shut down the fryer 2 hours to close why is it acceptable they shut down the shake machine."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, super friendly they always do good by us I wish other Arbys would fallow by their example."}
{"text":"Great staff and the best value for a quick, Reuben sandwich. Clean environment, easy drive thru menu, friendly service and responsive managment. I suggest using their coupons. Amazing deals."}
{"text":"The General Manager of this location is absolutely phenomenal. He acknowledged me as soon as I walked in the door and once I had placed my order, he looked at my credit card and wrote my name on the receipt so he could call out a name instead of a number when my order was ready. The location itself is outdated but the service demonstrated by the GM was fantastic."}
{"text":"I didn't know this new Arby's had a Yelp page just yet or I would've checked in.. I've been here 5 times since it opened two weeks ago haha! 

Anyways the staff works very well and efficient here. The line may seem long, but they get it done soo quickly. The first few days, the big bosses were asking what you'd like and wrote it down while you were in line. You simply handed it to the cashier on your way in. They havent done this since the first week it opened, but im just explaining how efficient they are.

One thing that is a huge difference from the other Arby's is the size of the dining room. It looks pretty tiny, but does hold a nice amount of tables. There is no upstairs so what you see is what you get. I always went at lunch hour while it was busy and never had an issue finding somewhere to sit. 

I dig Arby's, so I was pretty happy whenever i  seen a new one was coming to downtown."}
{"text":"We stopped in after visiting my sister in the hospital. We didn't want hospital food, and also just wanted something quick and affordable. I ordered their farmhouse salad which included cheese, tomatoes and my choice of crispy chicken or turkey (I went with chicken) salad was $4.99 which is a great deal. It also tasted fresh and was a nice size. My bf took advantage of the $1 sliders. He ordered a buffalo chicken one and roast beef jalapeno. We both ordered a value fry (mine was for my salad!)

overall a super cheap meal and not bad. I don't frequent fast food places too often, but arbys isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"I looked at other reviews and I have been here before so I can honestly say my Cuban sandwich was delish. Meat was tender and just the right amount of mustard and the pickle gave me a nice bite. I ordered the onion rings and they were hot and very crispy. I like to avoid fast food but had to try this and am happy with it."}
{"text":"Every single booth table was dirty. I asked for no tomato on my sandwich and there were tomatoes. It was also the messiest flat bread sandwich I think I have ever had. Half of my husband's roast beef wasn't even on the bun. There was no excuse for this. They were not busy. There was only one other couple in the restaurant. 

Never coming here again"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we returned to this particular Arby's because in the past we felt it was going downhill. Thanks to a new manager who takes PRIDE in his restaurant and seems to be very involved--this place has new life once again!!! We were greeted by the manager who was happy to advise us on our choices and we were NOT disappointed!!! I had inquired as to the quality of the turkey on the Market Fresh Turkey sandwich (you know, whether it's the cheap, slimy stuff or the good stuff that tastes like it was just carved from the turkey)--and without missing a beat, he happily said \"here, I'll get you some to try and see for yourself!\" With that, he brought out a nice sample portion of the turkey--and it was fresh, tasty and REAL! The restaurant itself was spotless and very orderly. While we dined on our delicious, hot & fresh food, we noticed the manager himself walking through the restaurant, checking on things, wiping the counters and straightening things. As he passed us, he asked if everything was \"okay\"--I gave him a big \"thumbs up\" and told him that I am putting a good compliment on Yelp for his business because I believe in giving credit where credit is due. This manager has what it takes--and he is what EVERY business needs--someone who is truly loving his job and making every effort to satisfy his customers and achieve great success while doing so! Everything was PERFECT. Thank you for \"MAGA\"...MAKING ARBY'S GREAT AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best place to go. Our last trip to visit family we stopped here. The staff was extremely rude. Fries were not cooked and the meat was frozen. Yes! You read correctly. They wanted to charge us for another meal which we declined.  The machine for soft drinks was also a mess. You pressed Lemonade and the spout splashed everywhere like a sprinkler (wth) to make matters worse the mix was off (syrup +tonic water) we attempted Pepsi and clear carbonate water (tonic water) came out. The only positive thing was a bystander who saw me getting hosed by the machine came over with napkins -- good karma sir. To the staff who laughed tsk tsk. Bad customer service and bad food service and hospitality. Also you were reported."}
{"text":"They didn't get our order right , our food was cold and not good. Just not good service all together . My friend and I both will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"This ARBY's NEVER gets my order right. Unfortunately, I work close to it and do like Arby's food so I keep going back. Even though drive thru is convenient I always go in because it is necessary to check my order. Today 2 items were wrong. My manager has gone and gotten a refund because they got her order wrong twice in the same day. Poor communication among employees. Hire someone who can pay attention to details. This location butchers my favorite fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Good drive through experience tonight. Fast and the guy was super helpful with my order."}
{"text":"I just watched Arby's ad on TV they have the 2 for 5.00 sandwiches and fry.  So I sent my husband there to grab food and this store says,,oh well ended that,we'll you're advertising it so it should be honored,right??? The manager will not do it,,I won't be going back to this place again so they list money from us.  Don't advertise if you can't honor it!! Assholes..I only choose 1 star or I couldn't leave a review,otherwise I'd be taking stars away."}
{"text":"The young woman working the drive-thru window on March 6th around 1pm was an absolute ROCKSTAR! So was so pleasant, professional and polite! She even took the time to personally double check that my order was correct (without me even asking). Good workers like her are few and far between. She deserves a promotion!! I didn't get her name, but thank you from a vegetarian that normally gets hassled about my orders. You made my lunch experience the best it could possibly be!"}
{"text":"I only use the drive thru here but its usually fast & accurate. I like the food and its prepared the way i like it - NO SAUCE. I think thats the problem both other reviewers had with the food here. So dont order it with sauce. Also make sure you order the horsey sauce. The hubby claimed he hated arbys til he tried it with horsey - now he likes it!"}
{"text":"Arby's has always held a special place in my heart since childhood. My father and grandfather took me often...anyway love their chicken cordon bleu sandwich. Everything that I have had on their menu is good. I will say they are a little pricey though! The food is good, and they do have the meats! Lol"}
{"text":"I didn't have occasion to go inside this Arby's,I just went through the drive thru. I had a craving for a peppermint milkshake and when I did some research online the only fast food place I could find that had the peppermint flavor Rather than pumpkin or egg nog was the Arby's. Fortunately it wasn't very far from my motel. The milkshake was very good although I'm not sure if they use real ice cream.  The kid at the counter was very generous with whipped cream, and while it wasn't huge it was big enough that I could drink half that night and freeze half to eat a couple days later.  The price was $2.99."}
{"text":"Slow.  They also need to train their cooks on how to make sandwiches.  I used to work at Arbys and I sure as hell know that a turkey ranch and bacon wrap does NOT come with spicy brown mustard-- which has happened to me TWICE at this location.  They've also put the wrong sauce on the gyro before.  Not sure why I keep going back--I think I'm DONE with this location."}
{"text":"Ugh, I hadn't been to an Arby's in \"forever\" and now I remember why.  Skimpy meat portions, over-salted and dry meat, and just \"blah\" all around.  Sure, it's fast and the service was friendly.  It's expensive for what you get, which isn't much."}
{"text":"I went looking forward to the chicken salad sandwich. 
I was disappointed. 
No taste. Only thing that had a taste was the 2 grapes that I found in the mix. 
I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Hot fresh food. They bring the food out to you. If not busy they come out and take your trays if your done. Kept clean and they would clean between the orders."}
{"text":"i hope this helps.  I like to get sliders from here, but as mentioned in other reviews,  they are so slow they should pay us.  you will use up a lot of gas waiting. 20 minutes is being nice.  I waited almost double that and ya my sliders suck.  they are all cold and im ripping them in half looking for the meat.
no more for me im done. SLOW SERVICE COLD FOOD..........KIDDIES WHO ARE TRYING BUT FAILING BECAUSE THEY DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO.  I would say its managements fault but if you met these kids.........well since they belong to my neighbors,  they are not smart.  10 more years of school prob. would not help.  maybe they should go back to grade school and start over.  and whoever the adult in charge is should be fired for not doing their job properly.
come on arbys  fix this store..........fire em all and start over or closed it down so we can get a wendys."}
{"text":"for fast food, they're pretty good. but I will say, the older gentleman with glasses should really find a job that suits him better. He cannot hear the best & I felt like i was repeating my order more to him than he was to me. The way he speaks isn't always clear either. My daughter nor I could understand him at some points in the conversation. 
Love it here, but it's frustrating to come in when he's working the drive thru & the front counter."}
{"text":"This place has a convenient location on the Day Drive fast food strip.  Friendly service.  The menu, is not necessarily my favorite.  Overly seasoned, overly salted in general.  Tasty sandwiches that are loaded with sodium and fat.  If you feel the need, at least this place has good service."}
{"text":"Arby's has evolved from being a roast beef restaurant to a sandwich shop.  Most of their items seem a bit heavy, comfort food.  Good on occasion but not every day.  I have been to this location multiple times.  Of all the Arby's, and most fast food restaurants, I have been to, I wonder how this one stays open.  Not for the quality of food, which is OK, or service, which is also OK.  It has the most dysfunctional drive through I have ever seen.  It is a challenge to drive around without denting your car.  The parking lot is also congested, and the access to the entrance is a real challenge."}
{"text":"Arby's serves up fresh sandwiches that are tasty but not very healthy.  Think high in calories, fat and sodium.  More than other fast food outlets.  Fries are tasty, potato cakes are unique and good.  Service is timely and friendly.  This location is clean and pleasant.  Too bad the food can't match up."}
{"text":"After the remodel. Place looks immaculate and the food is good as usual. Good service good people. Stop by there people. You won't think twice next time. Thank you Arbys"}
{"text":"It's ok. I like the jr. hot ham & cheese sandwich. Today I ordered it with a jamocha shake, because it's hot outside, and shakes are cold, so I figured it would balance me out. 

The jr. ham & cheese sandwich is on their value menu (it's always weird and flattened looking no matter which Arby's I go to), so is the small jamocha shake (on the value menu I mean...not weird or flattened like the sammich). 

My hunger was satiated, the bill was cheap (for Arby's), and so far it has not made me sick, so I have no complaints. 

I don't go to Arby's very often, I'm not a fan of roast beast (unless it's a REAL roast with potatoes and stuff), but when I'm wanting a hot ham & cheese (and since there aren't any Hardee's around this joint) this is where I go...until I find a different venue that will gratify, satisfy and quiet my urges."}
{"text":"Wow the new Arby's looks great! And curly fries are back! Their fish sandwich was huge! And delicious! Got two cars either couldn't decide which one to get. Would recommend. Way better than the old one that was shut down."}
{"text":"Ron was amazing here had an issue at another Arby's and he completely took care of the situation are remade my order! Couldn't be more happy after leaving here(: Thank you Ron, Arby's should be proud to have you"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful experience at Arby's. Tasty food and excellent service. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place.  My buddy Nigel owns a few of these in Redding, Ca .   So he made me come with him to check out the place and it was great.

Food was tasty and the place was clean. Bernice was very nice."}
{"text":"This is my place. I always get a BLT-no mayo or a French dip... both are great and so are the people."}
{"text":"It has been years since I last stopped here. Whole bunch of new menu items. Some new paint in places. Just happened to be in the area wondering where to grab a bite to eat. I had a corned beef Reuben and it was OK. Service was decent and friendly. Every few years I get a craving for a beef and cheddar or two and stop at whatever one I am near."}
{"text":"This would be my local Arby's.  I go here every once in a while with a coupon.  This time I went because I wasn't eating meat for a month and they had a special on fish sandwiches.  I should have known better than to expect a place specializing in sliced beef to have a great fish sandwich.  But I will still keep going back for beef and cheddars."}
{"text":"Arby's is gross. They have slimy meat. I can see someone ODing in the bathroom of this place within the month. Just go to the grocery store and get some roast beef, bread and provolone and stop being creeps"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about Arby's Restaurants.  I heard that they were recently purchased by a large chain so I decided to see if the menu had improved.   I didn't see anything much different so maybe the change hasn't taken place yet.  
Their Market Fresh sandwiches are pretty good.   Their Reuben is ok but not terrific.  The rye seems to be some sort of fake rye.   Maybe I am wrong on that but I don't like it and I love rye bread.   So what is going on here?
No regular fries, only curly fries which I hate.
Prices are way too much for fast food.  I can spend the same at a sit down restaurant for the same or better food.  Is it more expensive because of the fast food convenience?    I don't think so.
Service was very good.   So hats off on that but this review is mostly about the food.   Flavors are good to but we are unhappy with some of the quality and especially the prices."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say here. I guess I went in on a bad night. I'm in town for work, so I went through the drive through to get a beef and cheddar and some potato cakes to munch on in my hotel room. When I got to the hotel room (the Aliante, which is minutes away) the bag was saturated with grease (see photo). I immediately went back and the crew working were unfriendly and unapologetic. No apologies or any sense of compassion. When I first walked in and told them about my greasy bag, the punk kid working the counter rolled his eyes and told some woman, you deal with this. She was equally as unpleasant as him. What a crew full of jerks!"}
{"text":"Thought I would give the new Fish Sandwich Special a try.  I thought it was great.  Fast food usually gets a bad rap but this sandwich was much better than most restaurants I have been to."}
{"text":"Was late coming home from work and was TIRED.  Hubby called and asked me to get dinner.  I liked my swiss, bacon, & chicken comb.  My hubby got 4 of those roast beef sandwiches.  They have shrunk in size!  Honey, I shrunk the sandwich.  LOL!  It was still good but much smaller."}
{"text":"I ran in to grab a quick bite before my workout. Staff is friendly got my food on time and fresh. Can't go wrong with a roast beef sandwich. Tables could have been a little bit cleaner."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Arby's I have ever been at! The manager was very friendly, it was very clean and the food was delicious! Recommend it 100%!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I decided to make a change for lunch today and hit Arby's. We're not strangers to Arby's but I wouldn't say were regulars either so we decided to take a look at the online menu. I found a Market Fresh Farmers Chopped Salad that looked pretty good so decided to order that. When we arrived at Arby's they tell us they don't have any such salad. Now with Yum brands at least their restaurant websites will tell you \"at participating locations\" this Arby's location offered no explanation. Now because my co-worker and I split the bill for lunch when we return to the office amongst each other a receipt is required to do so. Well no receipt either. If that wasn't enough, when it was time to dig in and eat we also discovered that the Arby's sauce we requested was non-existent... My alternate food choice was amazing but the service and experience.. meh."}
{"text":"Very disorganized. My sandwich order  took 15 minutes and I had to ask where it was.  They also ran out of dollar bills for change and had workers walking around behind the counter looking confused.  To top it off, my sandwich was cold.  Poor management and training."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE PLACE! 
I ordered the new Beef n Cheddar sandwich.
1oz of meat!? Also, cold meat. That's a joke?, or is this the new style to rip off people... The meat now tastes like the smell of horse shit. $9 dollars for the meal!
I asked for FRESH curly fries and she said they just made it. NOT I was standing there and watched and no it is not fresh! Mixed with warm and cold product."}
{"text":"Wow!! This is the cleanest fast food restaurant I've been in this year. On a scale of one to ten for cleanliness I give them an eleven. Keep this Arby's on your list of good places to eat. Great service too"}
{"text":"I usually don't even eat at Arby's .. but over the last few years I stop in for a milkshake. Never got one yet..This solon location in particular has the same excuse every time. It's either are machine is down or it's broke.. The truth is they wanna clean it early so it's less to do later... this Arby's if franchise owned or corporate owned should get back to the basics and stop sitting around collecting money.."}
{"text":"So I ordered a sandwich, just a single item and added cheese for which I was charged. I was the only car in the drive thru. Here is a photo of my sandwich WITH OUT CHEESE! How can you screw up a single sandwich order when your store is totally dead? Of course by the time I drive home and notice the place is about to close. This is totally unacceptable and below the standards of any fast food place. So I'm stuck with a meat and bread sandwich...great :("}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this Arby's. I don't frequent downtown often, but I needed a quick snack. The restaurant has a modern feel with decoration. It was warm and inviting. 

I ordered from their value menu. I ordered a roast beef slider, vanilla milkshake, small fry, and slated caramel cookie. I went a little overboard but I love the milkshakes and cookies. 

The food was prepared just as I expected and the service was quick. There is a bell located by the door so that you can acknowledge the staff for their good service. Many people rang the bell. I would recommend this location if you find yourself downtown and need a quick meal."}
{"text":"Go to Jack in the Box. The people here deserve to be out of work. It is amazing how badly they do their jobs and then to have to listen to a manager argue about what we did wrong... Let me tell you what we did wrong - CAME TO ARBY'S!"}
{"text":"This place reminded me soooooo much of this song:

http://www.sanchezbrothers.com/music/fuggetaboutit.mp3

But the best part was walking in and quickly realizing I was the only person over 22 yet under 65.   This made me feel like Jesus in a way."}
{"text":"This is the SLOWEST drive-thru ever. I waited for 25 minutes with two cars in front of me...what ever happened to \"please pull into a parking space and we'll bring it out to you\" to avoid holding up the whole line? Cashier apologized, asked me if I wanted sauce and offered free chocolate pastry. Guess what? No sauce and no chocolate pastry to be found in my bag. Seriously, if I ever want fast food in my area again I'll just drive the extra mile to Sonic."}
{"text":"Always polite and kind. They made a mistake and had to wait 5 minutes more but no big deal. They aplogize couple of times. Great customer service and food is always made fresh because they make you wait. My kids love their food."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices. My only concern is they have got morons running the drive thru.  Yeesh."}
{"text":"Well I wouldn't give them even a star. They were friendly but the Rueben sandwich I ordered had such a small amount of meat on it I actually had to look. Those gourmet sandwiches are not inexpensive for fast food. I was not impressed even in those times you have to grab fast food. We have so many choices especially on Bell road I would think twice in regard to stopping out of convenience. I was NOT impressed."}
{"text":"Absolute crap. No one acknowledges you, employees act and talk as if they hate their job and life. The cashier if that's what you call her, was about bright as a broken brick. The service is extremely slow and worthless. The owners/managers really should cut their losses and get people who actually want to work. Sorry excuse for a place to eat. If I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"If you want food poisoning, this is the place for you!! Ate a roast beef sandwich @ 12:40pm on Monday, just a sandwich, and was VIOLENTLY THROWING UP FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS!!! Tried to call and talk to someone or a manager about it, and the phone just rings nobody answers!! Only reason I give it 1 star is because it wont let me go lower...."}
{"text":"They messed up my order!!!! I was so excited to try the mountain meat sandwich, but, they gave me a brisket sandwich instead. This place has horrible management!!!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! Me and my gf are from out of state. Who doesn't like Arby's.. We we go in and we are waiting five minutes for our food and I hear a wannabe manger say under her breath. \"Should have locked the doors\". Straight rude as can be. I'll surely check that place off my list and will be calling the higher ups on her. She's the reason fast food gets a bad wrap.. Horrible person that should get fired from her job. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"The SLOWEST place I have ever been to!! The drive thru is literally slower than a sit down restaurant, I'm not exaggerating!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Arby's since the late 70's when I was in university and just off of managing Burger Chefs for three years.

I don't eat at fast food places much, probably 10-15 times per year.  I've frequented this Arby's over the years at least twice per year.  Unfortunately it has fallen prey to the same problems as all fast food places, their cashiers have a 100% failure rate for us since 2012.

My son stopped there today on the way home, asked for two potato cakes. One came with his meal deal (2 cakes per order) and when he got him SURPRISE! No second order. I asked him to check the order to see what he was charged and when he checked, he discovered that he never received a receipt.

Enough! I'll start frequenting fast food places again when I can smack the person at the register to wake them up.  Hey, mistakes will happen from time to time.  But a 100% failure rate demonstrates absolute stupidity on the employee's part.  Makes us both wonder how he got enough cash together for all of those tats he was sporting."}
{"text":"OK, So I am normally a pretty big fan of Arby's. As far as fast food goes, its near the top of my list, but I will never go to this particular Arby's again. Everytime I go, something gets screwed up, and the last time I went everything about it pissed me off. I got a large drink with so much ice that I could'nt even get a straw into it, and once I managed too, there was about 2 ozs of liquid in a 32 oz cup. I asked for Arby, Horsey, and ketchup at the window, and ended up with 1 pack of Horsey. And I think for an $8 regular combo meal, they can throw a few sauces in. Very disappointed in Pecos and Windmill Arbys right now."}
{"text":"I just waited over 25 minutes in drive thru lane for a simple Arby sandwich.  What a joke.  Avoid this place until they can properly staff their restaurant."}
{"text":"It has been months since they opened and the still take forever to get the meal from the drive through."}
{"text":"It's an Arby's! They're all very similar, but this one made me write a review because if the hard working crew and friendliness if the location. I had a great breakfast here today. Food is good - I think the best of the fast food places (except In - n - Out Burger).  Safe and clean!"}
{"text":"Where is Clara Peller when you need her?

Arby's... my favorite place for fast food.
I love a good roast beef sandwich from Arby's.
Today I went to the one located on East Tropicana Avenue in Las Vegas.
Service was slow for my taste. 
I was a bit extra hungry so I ordered a regular roast beef sandwich meal with curly fries and a drink. I also ordered a junior size roast beef sandwich.
I got my order to go, as I was headed in to work for the day. 
I sat at my desk, reached into the bag and grabbed the \"Jr Roast Beef Sandwich\". Even for a \"Jr\" sized sandwich, I almost immediately said \"WHERE'S THE BEEF?\""}
{"text":"The new Arby's beef gyros were really good. Of course its not the real gyro meat, but the tzatziki sauce makes it taste like the real thing.  Service was quick. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Arby's is easily one of my favorite places to go for fast food.
Arby's is easily NOT one of my wife's favorite places to go for fast food.
That being said...

Service, cleanliness and such are always pretty standard for a fast food restaurant.

We dropped off our daughters close by for a Girl Scout meeting. This Arby's was within walking distance from said meeting. I saw a sign advertising sliders. My wife saw a sign for a mint chocolate flavored milk shake. 

Why have sliders when you can eat a full meal while your wife enjoys a milk shake?

We both left happy."}
{"text":"Every time we come to this location it is a pleasant and a satisfying experience.  The employees are always polite and positive.  The order is always accurate!  All in all it is a pleasure coming here.  If you are looking for an Arby's that \"on the ball\" this is the one"}
{"text":"Order their delicious Reuben! Fast, efficient, courteous service. Extra clean."}
{"text":"While the service has been excellent, and the staff professional and efficient (5 Stars), I do have a \"beef\" with their Beef n Cheddar sandwich. Now, the fries were nice and hot :) , and I asked that the cheddar cheese be hot too. But, when I got the sandwich, the beef was room temp, and the cheese wasn't much warmer. :( So, because of that, and had I posted this visit only, they would have gotten 3 Stars.

But, on my 2nd visit, I ordered the Onion Rings, Apple Turn over and a small Chocolate milk shake. Well, the rings were fresh out of the fryer (Yay!), and the turn over was just as yummy as i remember (though, I remember when the price was under a dollar, without a coupon). Though,  the Chocolate milk shake was okay."}
{"text":"I know why this place has such a negative review. Quick to rush to go orders out the door = not everything done right . Barely any meat on French dip missing fries no sauces available . 
Wow what a let down"}
{"text":"If you want to get high and work at the same time, just apply for a job at Arby's. The service was just horrible. Employees were walking around like zombies. Food was horrific. Employees were rude, sarcastic, and downright disrespectful. Service was slower than a sloth in a 100 yard dash. Oh! and the place was filthy! Floors, tables, and chairs had old food all over them. 

Completely disgusted."}
{"text":"This is on of the worst arbys I have ever been to they got our order wrong the fries were burned and their customer service sucks."}
{"text":"The service was completely unacceptable I waited 20 minutes to make my lunch order, then it took another 20 to receive it. I didn't even receive what I ordered I was so upset that I didn't go back to replace it I just gave to a homeless person standing on the corner.  I will not be doing business with this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Is it weird to say that i fell in love at an Arby's? With barb!! Omg cutest little old lady! The food was basic, good Arby's food but the service from Barb at the inside register is that earned this establishment 5 stars! Keep up the good work, Barb!"}
{"text":"Just stopped into Arby's for a quick sandwich and salad. Both were delicious.  The lady in charge ( Berta) was obviously having a bad day and seemed to be taking it out on the sweet young girl at the register (Laura). Yes I realize the drive thru was busy but does that give her the right to be rude and short tempered to a new employee trying her very best to learn the job?  Not only did she make Laura feel uncomfortable, she made all of the customers standing in line feel uncomfortable as well.  Customer service begins with your co-workers. If you are having a bad day just stay home!!"}

When I told him that the smell was disturbing my family he laughed and replied well what would you want me to do about it in a smart tone. I spend a lot of money here and hate to not patronize this establishment because of some rude employees"}

Super helpful staff!! Delicious food and great service!!! Got 2 sandwiches, potato chips and a refill for lessons than 9 bucks with bunch of sauces... Good for snacks on the go!!;) #meat_loverZ!!"}
{"text":"Idk why everyone is so negative about fast food lol you're acting as if it's fine dining. My experience was cool and the staff was nice. Yadel got my order correctly and had no problems. My only complaint was my fries were cold. But hey. It's fast food. I'm not freaking out. 
Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Usually a bit pricey for me but ordered the Farmhouse salad with roasted turkey and lt. Italian dressing at $4.99. Let me tell you that is a delicious salad and under 300 cal. with light dressing; can't go wrong. A bit slow getting it but that's due to them making it fresh."}
{"text":"Received a coupon in the mail for a BOGO Beef & Cheddar Sandwich....so I dropped by this location to grab a bite.  I was starving when I arrived, so I over-ordered.  In addition to my 2 Beef & Cheddars, I ordered a Roast Chicken Club Sandwich and a Curly Fries....damn, there goes the diet!

The Beef & Cheddars were ok.  The Roast Chicken Club was very good.  Of course, their Curly Fries are one of their signature items....and was solid.

The kids working at this place were very friendly and were working hard to  keep the restaurant clean. I could hear them in the back talking about how to properly mop the floor and wipe down the tables.....sometimes the current generation gets it right.

It's larger than most fast food Chicken Sandwiches and the flavor is pretty good.  Not too bad.  However, it wasn't good enough to get me 'addicted' so I would 'crave' it again.

{"text":"I cant complain i always get great service here. I came one day after i got off work their drive through. The manager explained that theyre short staffed, and drive through is crazy which it was. He was taking our orders, and helping bag food. I think they do a great job they treat people with respect. Its always clean. Theyre doing something right i keep giving them my business"}

{"text":"When this Arbys was first remodeled, it was great.The food and service were very good. Now both are average at best. The pop always tastes like the lines need cleaned. The buns are usually stale or close to it, and whatever food you get is lukewarm. The employees are still friendly most of the time, but they make careless mistakes more often."}

{"text":"I stopped by this Arby's yesterday because I wanted to grab something for a quick bite last night... They have so many new items on the menu and I figured I'd give them a shot... 

I ordered the Mighty Minis, which are basically sliders with roast beef or turkey and topped with different things... I picked the spicy option that comes with jalapeno ranch and pepperjack cheese... The thing is, I hate ranch... I think it's one of the worst things I've ever encountered... Okay, it's not that serious, but I just don't like it... So clearly, I ordered my minis without ranch... It came out on the receipt as no ranch, but when I got it home, guess what I found?  Yep.  Ranch.  Ick.  lol  Luckily, the boyfriend loves ranch probably about as much (if not more) than I hate it, so I let him have those... I called the store back and let them know I was coming back to buy the ranch free minis... The person on the phone was fantastic and let me know she'd take care of it... I walked in and they apologized for the mix-up and had the sandwiches ready... They didn't even charge me and gave me an extra set of minis... Great customer service, guys... 

I've been coming here whenever I get a craving for the past few months and it's always been a pleasant experience... Their sanitation scores are always high, the workers are a joy and the food is super tasty... Way to be, Arby's... Way to be..."}

Worth driving from Summerlin to not have crap service at another location. THANKS!"}

They are a bit more pricey then other fast food places but I guess it's worth it once in a while. Spending over $20 for two for fast food is a bit too much for me so we don't come as often."}

{"text":"This Arby's is close to our house... the only reason we occasionally order from them. 

They enter your order on the computer... when you get home to eat the orders are always wrong. Order 4 sandwiches and get home and there's only 3. I have a cheese allergy and always order 'no cheese'... get home and sandwich covered with cheese. Order potato cakes... they forget to put them in the bag. We shouldn't have to open each sandwich at the counter before we take it home. 

Here's what really ticked off my husband... he ordered a corned beef sandwich and requested no sauce ... he got home and there was sauce and no sauerkraut ! 
What the heck is wrong with this Arby's???? 

I read the 11 reviews on this place and most of them were the same complaints ... obviously the owner doesn't care as if he did he would address these Yelp postings."}
{"text":"Not much of a fast food eater, but if I need something, I go to this Arby's. I've been here a few times while traveling and always get quality service and food. Jonathan was especially kind and helpful on my last visit. 

Nothing special but at least you know that you run less of a risk of your order being messed up here, and you'll be served with a smile. Seems like their staff tries to regularly go above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Ordered a classic roast beef sandwich and it was cold and the bread was old and stale. Returned after work to get a refund and was told since i didn't have a receipt i was up a creek.

{"text":"Wow way to ruin why the only reason I come to Arby's. I only come when I want to get something kind of healthy which is the turkey, lettuce, tomatoe, bacon wrap. I order at the drive thru and I tell him I want the wrap with lite ranch. He then says ok. Btw I ordered just the wrap no combo. I pull up to the window and the guy hands out the Arby's bag and is like you know theirs no ranch on this right? I said what do you mean I wanted lite ranch and he goes you ordered a number 14 not a number 15. I was like ummmm I just ordered the wrap that's all I want. He gets pissed at me and said you ordered the wrong number and slams the bag back inside the window and slams the window after he gives my credit card back. I was like WTF. I almost just drove off because he was so rude and such a prick that I really didn't want anything from him anymore. Plus now this guy seems like he's the type of person who will spit in your food for making him have to redo your order. I decided to wait because i didn't want to match his low attitude by driving away. I waited 6-7 minutes and then he gives me my wrap in a bag nothing else. No napkins, nothing. This was the guy that looked kind of Asian with his ears gaged. BEWARE HES AN ANGRY MAN THAT OBVIOUSLY hates his job. Never coming back. Now there's no reason for me to go there."}
{"text":"I wanted to introduce my niece to Arby's. She'd never eaten there before (is that even a thing? Who doesn't like Arby's?) and was willing to give it a try. The lady at the register was friendly and was training a new employee. She even apologized for it. I told her no worries. Got my order placed and went to find a seat. 
It seemed to take a little longer than normal for the order to come up, I know because I used to work at Arby's years ago. When I saw my order coming up, I walked up to get it. The lady who took my order was turning around and about to call my name when she saw me. She apologized for it taking a bit. Again, no worries. 
Sat down and my teenage niece got to try her first curly fry and jamocha shake, fry dipped in the shake, of course! Her eyes got big. She approved. Then she bit into her chicken cordon blue sandwich. Or I should say tried to. The chicken was weird she said as she was choking part of it down. I asked her what she meant. She said it was hard and handed it to me. She had bitten through the bun, cheese, ham, and coating on the chicken, but COULDN'T BITE THROUGH THE MEAT! It was tough, you could feel it, and the coating was browner than I've ever seen on one of their sandwiches. Ok, it happens. I walked up with it and gave it to the trainee who took it to the manager. She stuck her fingers into it, and looked at me and said it was fresh and they'd just made it. I let her know that it was tough to the point of being inedible. She actually asked me what I wanted her to do about it! I'm like, are you kidding me? She offered me a regular classic roast beef instead. Aside from the fact that she was offering me a sandwich that is about a buck fifty less than the rock sandwich we'd gotten, my niece doesn't eat beef. Otherwise I'd have gotten her one to begin with, because duh, they're the bomb. So I asked for a couple ham/cheese sliders. 
SHE ROLLED HER EYES AT ME AND SIGHED like a spoiled rich kid who is being asked to throw away their own trash! She calls out for two sliders. I waited. I saw them come up. So did she. But the order she was waiting for wasn't up yet so she walked away. Came back a minute later, PUSHED MY SLIDERS OUT OF HER WAY, and proceeded to bag up 3 other orders as they came up. She didn't touch them, and once all the other orders were passed out she started to turn to walk away. I looked at her and said \"Really, you're just going to push my sliders aside and ignore them?\" She got really snotty with me and said she'd get to them in a second. Not once during the whole exchange did she apologize for the inedible food. In fact, not once did she speak to me in any way other than snide, irritated, and rude. Finally gave me the tray and said here you go. I told her thanks for nothing. Then she said really loud and sarcastic \"have a nice day!\" 
This person, Michele D. should not be in customer service or food service if she can't deal with people without the attitude. I will still go to my beloved Arby's, just not this one! The two stars is because the other employees were pleasant, and my niece loved the food that she could eat. My roast beef was cold by the time I could eat. I took it home. My dog was very happy with it. 

Update: I got a call from the store manager today apologizing for what happened. She said she will talk to the employee to make sure it doesn't happen again. She assured me that it was not typical behavior. I know we all have bad days so I will give them another chance. I appreciate that my complaint was heard and dealt with. That's always a good sign in my book."}

{"text":"Arby's is one of my go-to fast food establishments to grab a quick bite to eat especially since 2 for 1 coupon are available on a monthly basis in the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

One of my favorites is the 2 for 1 French Dip special for $7.00 to which I usually add a large order of curly fries and that is what I purchased during today's visit on 04/20/2018. Service was extremely slow after order placement, but the food was extremely tasty as well nice and hot as usual. 

This is not my preferred Arby's location and I only stopped here, because I was in the neighborhood running errands elsewhere. I usually visit the Arby's at 4521 North Rancho where service always has been consistently quick and good, most likely because there always is an experienced manager (as in adult!) on site.

The current no-coupon-needed special of 2 Greek Gyros (pronounced \"yeeros\" with no distinction between singular or plural) is also worth looking into and will likely be the next item that I purchase."}

{"text":"This is a review for my wife.  I was going out for dinner last night and she didn't want the food I was going to be having so I had to provide something for her.  After giving several choices, she opted for Arby's whose Market Fresh sandwiches she liked in the past.

I drove down and got a turkey ranch with bacon Fresh Market sandwich and an order of curly fries.  I was home in no time at all.  When I got in late last night, she elated how good her dinner was.  She liked the sandwich and the fries were something that haven't been in the house for years.

Now from my perspective, service was just OK.  The counter critter who took my order was lethargic and that's being kind.  After taking my order, she went about filling some others and motioned to me when my order was ready.  There was only one person in the restaurant besides me and only two cars at the drive through.

Overall, the place gets an A-OK rating.  My wife was happy, I didn't have to make something for her at home, and I was off to Bouchon for some French Bastille Day food.  Win win!"}

They honestly seem as if they enjoy working here, which isn't something you see often at most fast food places (except for In-and-Out Burger). Most fast food workers have that \"I don't want to be here\" look on their faces, but not the employees at this place.

Of course, I can't end this review without commenting on the food. Overall, the food here is really good. I've tried several items here and my favorites are the roast beef sandwiches and rubens. The curly fries and mozzarella sticks are excellent sides that go great with any meal. I've tried the gyros (both the turkey and roast beef) and they are decent, but I think they would be even better if the meats were grilled.

On our way out, we rang the bell for good service. This was followed by loud cheering from the employees."}
{"text":"I can't say that their food is good or bad- I never got a chance to get that far. I pulled into the drive thru and waited a solid 45 seconds with no response. I pulled up to the window, I couldn't see anyone in the kitchen. As I pulled around the building, to be on my way, there were five employees outside the building on a smoke break.

That is just terrible service, and I don't want my food to be prepared by people who don't care about their guests."}
{"text":"We walked into this Arbys and within 10 seconds we walked out. It smelled like burning rubber mixed with cat urine.  If the smell of curly fries and deli meat can't overpower that raunchy stink then there is a serious problem afoot.  BEWARE."}

Didn't notice till we were already back on the highway headed out of town. Called the location and said if we return they would be happy to give us the missed items but otherwise there is nothing they are willing to do. Not willing to turn around while on this road trip so I guess I'm just out of the money."}
{"text":"This place is good if you get the roast beef or the seasonal fish sandwiches. Now they have the chicken sandwiches which is a huge mistake. Instead of getting more fryers, they use the same fryer they cook the curly frys in. The sandwich had the most nasty aftertaste ive ever eaten. When I called them they admitted that the fryers needed to be changed but they wern't alowed to change them. The frys were also dark brown and I didn't even eat them all. The prices are also crazy high for a fast food place. 2.35 for a large drink and 2.65 for a large fry. Your basicly paying for a meal without the sandwhich so always get the meal, cause you basicly get the sandwich for a dollar more. Arby's needs to stick to what they do best, fish and roast beef."}

{"text":"The cashier was extremely efficient. He got my order right the first time without making me repeat anything at the drive thru window. After he gave me my total, I made the decision to add a bottle of that fabulous Arby's Sauce they now sell by the bottle! Heaven!! He told me he would have my updated total at the window. When I got to the window and he gave me the total, I asked if that included the bottle of sauce. He responded, \"I'll take care of it.\" He then gave me the bottle for free!  Oh yes! I'll be back!"}

Great, fresh taste at 1/2 the price!"}
{"text":"I love Arby's. Avoid this one. Been there twice. First time I went around 6pm, expecting everything to be made fresh. It wasn't, the roast been was hard and dry on the edges and the bread was dry, like it had sat out in the open all day. I thought it might be a fluke so I went again. I got roast beef, again, around 8pm. This time it was dry on the edges like it had been sitting in shallow hot water for hours. Didn't finish all of it. Woke up sick to my stomach at 4am and had to miss work. Drive a bit farther to find a quality Arby's."}
{"text":"I am not a guest here very often BUT, this is by far the BEST Arby's I have ever been in. The service, the food, the management's commentment to serving customers is by far the best I have ever seen. Everytime I go back to this area in Charlotte I will eat here. These guys should be the trainers for every other Arby's in the state!"}
{"text":"We ate at this Arbys and were very surprised that since the reviews were so low if our food would be decent. But as an Elite yelper I think it is my duty to give individuals out there my best. The store is very clean besides some extra cleaning need do in the bathrooms, and the lobby was average clean . No dirt on tables or anything or litter. There was very little customers in lobby. We had slider roast beefs , French dip, and potato cakes. 

The individual that took our order was the manager and he was extremely nice and fulfilled the order completely the way I ordered it. He only forgot the side red ranch sauce but we are all human. The food was so amazing the roast beef was hot and just right, and the potato cakes were well done too , but I find that Arbys always under cooks them . The sauce for the French dip was brown and hazy and not clear brown like normal so this has changed. Probably for the bad, but a lot business have to get corners so as long not with roast beef its fine."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here at Arby's since I was hungry after shopping and needed food. It's been a while since I have been to an Arby's anyways. The cashier was friendly but unorganized, while I was even placing my order he was looking for a pen somewhere in the drive thru. Why he needed a pen no clue? I just ordered little sliders for now, so not to spoil dinner. 

The lobby of the store needs much attention most of the tables are very dirty and even the benches have crumbs in them. The bathroom needs attention too. My order was made properly but they forgot the large roast beef sandwich that I was taking to go. When I brought it to the cashiers attention he apologized and made the cook make one. I was glad for that. Overall the roast beef sliders were fresh and hit the spot."}
{"text":"It has been while since I ate at an Arby's.  So long that I don't remember what used to order. Since the commercial Arby's have showing on tv I have been wanting to try it. Finally today I did. I ordered the Medium Combo, that is the rueben, fries, and drink for $8.29 before tax. that includes 60 cents for the upgrade to medium. The rueben, and fries were hot. The marble rye bread was so soft and tasty it does not have any rye seeds. I miss that I like the seeds on mine. The cornbeef had a nice flavor to it. Over all the sandwich was pretty good and all the flavors blended well. The things that I would fix to make this sandwich awesome would be: Spread the meat out over the bread so that would cause for more meat, add more thousand island dressing and saurkroute. And bam! You got an awesome rueben."}
{"text":"Not the best Arby's. Service is slow, and spotty. Food is eh. I've never had such bland food from an Arby's before but this one definitely serves on that. Thought maybe it was a one time thing, nope. So yea I probably won't come back here anymore."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.

Ordered a classic beef and cheddar combo small. Got a medium beef combo. And didn't even give me any sauce. Fries were like leather. Will never go back."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Arby's in the country, very clean and roomy with extraordinary service. Everyone was friendly and the food was delicious. Five stars"}
{"text":"They never have any turnovers.  Time after time.  Recently I ordered a chicken slider.  The chicken was not even warm.  It was room temperature.  How can you make a deep fried item and not even warm it up.  It's insane.  I also got no receipt."}
{"text":"One of the best Arby's locations.  The staff is very helpful and pleasant.  They bring the food to you at your table if there is a wait.  I ate the Ruben which was spectacular.  Sometimes I get the classic roast beef.  The curly  fries are fresh.  Food quality is top notch for this chain.  Also unlike several other locations in Las Vegas they have never refused my coupons which are usually obtained directly from Arby's official website/Facebook."}
{"text":"I'm not a big Arby's fan, but was out and about shopping and was hungry and since I just got done at Burlington's I decided to come here to pick up something quick. 

The place was pretty empty so I was able to order right away. I decided on the Turkey Gyro combo which came with curly fries and a drink. I like how they give you the option to get a small, medium or large combo..the size difference is only with the fries and drink. Gyro is the same size. Anyways, I had ordered this Gyro one other time at another Arby's and loved it but at this location, it left much to be desired. 

The Gyro is made of Roast Turkey, Greek Seasoning, Tzatziki Sauce, Red Onions, Tomatoes, Shredded Iceberg Lettuce all put inside of a Pita. My pita was not toasted so it got soggy very quickly and I ended up having to eat it with a knife and a fork. The turkey meat was okay, tasted like something from the deli at Walmart, and the sauce was super bland. I almost didn't know there was any sauce on my Gyro since it had no taste to it. It was very disappointing. The fries looked overcooked and tasted like old oil. Again I was disappointed. At least the soda wasn't flat. 

Tables weren't cleaned and the floor still had food and napkins under them from the previous customers. I had to wipe down the table I sat at before I could eat. Trash was full stacked up with trays. Ketchup was completely out, so I had to ask for some. The drink station wasn't clean and most of the drinks were out. 

I'm not sure if I'll come back to this location again or not. Employees don't seem to concerned about keeping the place clean, organzined and the items filled."}

{"text":"We are here after a long road trip. We were tired from the road and forgot to order my wife's wrap with no cheese and mayo as she is lactose intolerant. She couldn't eat her wrap so we went to buy her a new one but they told us they would make her one without charging us and we could keep the other wrap. Great staff. Very friendly and the nicest dining room I've ever seen in a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Thought I would enjoy some Arby's today for lunch. I order a double roast beef sandwich, curly fries and a shake, but I got a lot more than my meal. Crystal was working today, she made my day. Made me feel like I was more than just another customer. She has extraordinary customer service skills. I will go back to Arby's any day of the week just to see her smile. They should give her a raise or maybe employee of the month or can something. Awesome job Crystal!!!!"}
{"text":"Facility very clean and organized. Management very engaged and modeled good customer service skills for their staff. The food was hot/fresh and the curly fries were hot .. Yeah!"}
{"text":"I'm given this. Because the guy that works in  drive thru on Friday April 27,2018 around 1:45 to 2pm.  Needs some serious customer service. Does not say Thank you , Hi nothing every time he serves me. I've been going there for awhile he just don't get it with customers . I've spoke with the manger that day Apparently this is been going on for awhile now. Should let Ihim go if  he doesn't like it their. Your just gonna lose business"}
{"text":"So while eating lunch at this location this worker was disrespecting customers. It might just be personal but when any employee from any restaurant or business says to a customer \"What, you really think your one order is going to effect my store's sales?!\".....Ummmm yes it will because word of mouth helps a business more than you know and now with social media man it could hurt your business bad. Not only that but he has foul language more than i hear going to a bar I'm glad my kids are not with me I will not be back to this location ever again......This is what my husband had to say after eating lunch here today. He's a GM for a popular pizza place and customer satisfaction is a priority to him. Very disappointed by the language and conversations happening while we were at lunch today."}
{"text":"Got to drive in 5 minutes before closing, no one answered at the drive thru. If you're not going to be open until midnight, please don't advertise those hours"}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally review an Arby's, so you know there's gotta be something special about this Arby's location.

What's special about this Arby's is the customer service--more specifically, Shawn and Luther.  You'll know who these guys are if you have the pleasure of interacting with them.  They're charismatic, fun, gracious, and personable.  I wish they could have tip jars.

Oh, and just in general I'm an Arby's fan, a lover of the roast beef sandwich and seasoned curly fries.  One of very, very few fast food establishments I support.

{"text":"Wish I could give negative stars. The lady in the drive through was nice and knowledgeable but that is the highlight of my stop. I got one sandwich and it was a huge disappointment. The bread was hardly toasted and a dab of sauce and like 3 onion strings. Never visiting this location again. What a joke."}
{"text":"OMG! You cannot call this \"fast food\". On a Saturday afternoon at 2:30 it took almost 25 minutes to get my order.  Maybe they were short staffed but wow did I wait a long time for my order.  

I might have also taken creed in the other review that spoke of the cleanliness. Soon as I got in line I started looking around and sure enough it was not looking good.  Floors were dirty and while the trash wasn't piled up, it was hard to find a clean table to eat off of.  

I really thought these places had the formula down pat but this franchise needs work. Arby's Corporate please send the swat team down to train this store to give them a fighting chance.  I'm a big fan of Arby's but I doubt I'll be back to this locale."}
{"text":"BIG, NASTY BLACK HAIR in my curly fries. PO'D! 
Let us not speak any longer of this incident."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this Arby's location. The food is always fresh, the dining room is modern and typically very clean. Service is prompt and I have never had an issue with this location! A+!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, very clean fast food restaurant, and the Mid Roast Beef sandwich I ordered was nice and full of juicy roast beef."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Long line, one cashier. No soda products available, only tea and water. \"Something is wrong with the fizz thing\". Then the wait for our food, after 6 minutes and every customer behind us is served we walk up to the counter only to watch the woman fixing the order drop it on the floor. Yep, another 6 minute wait. No apologies. Ugh!"}
{"text":"25 minutes after ordering and still don't have our food.  5 others have gotten theirs and left.

On duty manager was nowhere to be found to even lodge a complaint.

This has happened more than once here.

We are done coming here."}
{"text":"The food was typical Arby's. The girl behind the register was not very welcoming. It seemed like we were wasting her time or interrupted her when we ordered. There was a lot of goofing off and loudness coming from the back."}
{"text":"I don't know how the food was because I went to the drive thru at 11 pm and no one was there to help me. It says they close at 12 so where was someone?  Extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Got a quick bite to eat. Food was good and fries were good too. I will likely eat here again. Overall good place to get a roast beef sandwich and fries."}
{"text":"Std Arby's. nothing special. A step above McDees"}
{"text":"I'm giving this establishment 2 stars only cause my son loves his roast beef sandwiches from here. 
My girlfriend just called to tell me that the young lady at the window gave her a death glare when asking for napkins. And this is after sitting in the drive thru behind two cars waiting 10 min for her food. 
Hold on, I have another story.....
While I'm here I might as well tell you what happen 8 months or so ago. 
Also going through the drive thru with my son and dog Lacey. I asked for the fish sandwiches w cheese. When I arrived at the window I over hear the woman tell the sandwich making professional to not forget the cheese. Before she hands me the bag she confirms that they put cheese on the fish. 
I receive my bag and drive off when I decide to check to see if there is cheese on the fish. 
I mean, after being told by a screen and twice by the server at the window you would think it would be on there. Well as you might have guessed by now, it wasn't. 
I did go in and have some simple choice words w the gentleman in the back as to why he didn't put cheese on it after all that. 
No response was made but by the window attendant with an apology. 

I do sincerely hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Arby's is becoming more and more popular in my book (since the late 80s).

Why? Because they don't hold back on the roast beef portions and their seasoned curly fries are ever SO good! *NOTE: Dipping these fries in ranch will make your breath smell like a garbage dumpster on a hot Phoenix day.

Love their Arby sauce and even though I loathe horseradish, I am forever enchanted that the cleverly named this their \"Horsie Sauce\". Tres cute!

Try their Andes shake that they have out right now. It's a thick milkshake w/chocolate swirls and crumbled Andes pieces on top of whipped cream. So good!"}
{"text":"In the process of placing my order the voice on the intercom changed and I realized the manager or someone in authority took over, wasn't along wait just online with 2 vehicles in front of me.

When I come up to the window I'm greeted by what appears to be a very unhappy employee but I put it to we all have a bad day. I hand her my debit card and they have me sign the receipt which I haven't seen before ( checking for fraudulent use of debit cards perhaps )

The food was received hot and fresh, and I tried not to interact with the employee for free of getting some serious attitude back in response.

I asked for some extra Arby's sauce and was given a few extra packets, I really hope ( which I tried to decipher her name \"MER\", is all I could read ) has the next couple of days off to chill....."}
{"text":"I've been popping in to this Arby's for a while now. It's clean and it's efficient. They have a decent drive through. The condiments are always well stocked. And I've yet to have a problem with any of my to go orders. Today - roast beef with cheddar, curly fries and a jamocha shake. What's not to like?

The windows are very shaded, so it might sometimes look like the place is closed."}
{"text":"Food was fine, service acceptable.  My concern was the way the ice was emptied into the soda dispenser.  Buckets of ice were dumped in via a 'used' piece of cardboard as a funnel!!!   The stored cardboard was stashed behind the machine and then they  used it again !!  Not very sanitary !!"}
{"text":"The staff on this particular visit was so friendly! While we were waiting, a nice lady assembling sandwiches asked our order first so she could make them fresh. Our cashier and manager (I believe her name was Shahari) was very hospitable, as well. 
The food tasted especially great and the inside of the restaurant had a clean, calming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good for a quick lunch.

I have come to know this particular location as \"the good Arby's\".  It's the only one in the valley that is consistently decent.  The place is mostly clean, the food is okay for what it is, and the staff are nice."}
{"text":"I've been disappointed with this place more times than not.  The fries are often cold and the beef just doesn't taste that fresh and the sandwich is put together sloppy.

Because of this store I've had to give up Arby's in Vegas."}
{"text":"This Arby's has great customer service and everything on the menu is delicious and affordable. Definitely the better choice for a restaurant being right next to me Donald's and Jack and the Crack. My favorite is the double roast beef sandwich with curly fries and a Dr. Pepper"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch alot and they have one of the best staffs at any Arbys I have ever been to and most fast food places. Its always very clean also and food good."}
{"text":"This place has some great sandwiches. The roast beef sandwiches and curly fries taste really good. You should come here!"}
{"text":"Probably not gonna believe me but I've eaten the two-for-$6 corn beef Reuben sandwich now 3 times and if you can find a better three dollar sandwich in town I'll put in with ya. 

I saw the ad on TV, I was starving. I stop by thinking, \"how bad could it be\"? And I also thought I would just put the two sandwiches gather making one big(ger) sandwich. There wasn't any need: it had size, volume, flavor...see photos I've attached.   

I ask for a side of 1000 Island dressing; it's better.  

The people at this particular Arby's were/are very nice and I'll be sad if the special goes away.

Well, the special did go away and Arby's now wants $7.59 for one sandwich. No way."}
{"text":"Soooo slow i wanted for the one car infrount of me for a few mins he was already ordering when i got there then i waited for 5min when i got to the speaker box after the kid (with no personality) said it would be just one minute then I waited at the window for my fries my whole drive through experience took 12 minutes I don't feel like that's very fast for fast food restaurant the food was fine just don't stop here if you're in any kind of hurry"}
{"text":"The brown sugar BLT is amazing!!!! The bacon is so good it seems unreal! They have six different brown sugar bacon sandwiches but all that I wanted was the bacon... That bacon and the Hawaiian bread.... Oooooh La Laaaaaaaass"}
{"text":"They always get my order wrong always!!!! Last time I came and went through drive thru I told my Bf check the bags cause they are notorious for missing an item or two or getting the order wrong. Sure enough they were missing my potato cakes and turnover ugh I can see once or twice making mistakes but every time???? And I come here randomly like once a year or 2 times in a month for 6 years and always get it wrong! Absolutely terrible I worked at Arby's I know what it entails this is unacceptable"}
{"text":"My Fiancé just had the best drive through experience! The gentleman that took the order was very thorough, he repeated the order back multiple times and made sure everything was correct! We have had bad luck with drive thru fast food lately, but this experience at Arby's restores our faith in capable people! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I went to Arby's with some coupons that I received in the mail.  I got two French dip sandwiches for $6!  That is an awesome deal.  The restaurant was very clean and the employees were super nice.  We didn't have to wait very long for our order and when it arrived it was correct.  It totally met my expectations."}
{"text":"The good- the dining room looks clean. My order was filled correctly. Sanitation grade reads- 96.5.  The food was okay. 
The bad- there's always an employee taking a \"smoke break \" as you walk in. Such a nice touch of class. 
The ugly- it smells like a toilet when you enter the restaurant. The restrooms are located in a closed area off the foyer.  As soon as you walk in the smell of musk and artificial fragrance hits you."}
{"text":"Vanessa was our cashier and she was very professional, and even went out of her way to give us our food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Arby's. Every single time I go to another one they forget a cup of cheese, don't sauce my Beef & Cheddar Max or they don't even know what a Max is. This one has kept it hot and fresh, accurate and friendly since I moved close by. Being the regrettably expert level fast food diner I am I would say this may be the best Arby's ever. In might add the fountain mix is almost perfect. Second only to the adjacent taco bell. Now that I've confessed too much and given a few great fast food tips I'll leave this here."}
{"text":"Just went to this restaurant around 5PM on  9/28/13... stood around for a few minutes pacing the register area and saw no employees. No one at the front register, drive-thru or cook stations. This place is always dead. Perhaps if there were people that actually worked, they'd have more patrons. So disappointed as I really wanted some chicken tenders :("}
{"text":"I completely forgot to transfer funds from one acct to the next before going through the drive thru. Yes I was that person! Of course I get zero signal here. Gabrielle was so amazing he helped me through and didn't fuss when I had to run to the bank accross the street, after changing my order 4 times. Wasn't my day, but wow amazing service you don't get with fast food. I'd go there just because his bright cheerfullness will put a smile on your face!"}
{"text":"I love this particular location. It's close to where I work so I go often for lunch. It's new and extremely clean. The employees are always friendly and accommodating. I've never received an order wrong and believe me, I make alot of modifications. I like that they have outlets at most tables so you can charge your phone if you need to. The only negative is exiting if you have to turn left onto Statesville Rd. It can be tricky depending on the time of day.

If you haven't tried their beef gyro, you must! It's surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Two Arby's for $5.00 with either the plain or cheesy. Stick with the plain, the cheesy one isn't near as good (cheesy taste funky) and check to make sure they put Horsey sauce in your bag before you leave. Large water isn't very large. Hope they keep the special going a while longer, that's the only reason we stopped by."}
{"text":"Drove 7 miles to get a \"Buy One get One Free Reuben\". Ordered a Ruben Combo and presented my O'Bill Coupon only to be told that the coupon is only good for a Reuben. Doesn't take a mathematical genius to figure out that a combo costing almost $8.00 will make Arby's more than 2 sandwiches costing $5.59. I tried to explain this to two elderly order takers to no avail and instead of walking out ordered a Ruben and got another free. The order taker tried to sell me a couple drinks and a curly fry (a combo) to which I replied NO. The sandwiches were gather from the heat lamp and plopped on a tray. I then had to ask for water cups. What a pitiful example of a great sandwich.  There was more thousand island dressing than the less than a tablespoon of sauerkraut and almost all of the meat on one side of the sandwich. I read the small print on the coupon and sure enough it says on good for a Reuben or a Double Reuben. Do you understand why Wendy's dumped you and  why there we NO customers in line inside or at the drive in when we were there?Who ever the marketing wizard is that dreamed up this special should be sent back to marketing school and take a simple math class. A $8.00 sale makes more money than a $5.59 sale!

Saturday evening Rick from Arbys called and followed up with this email
?Can you verify the location for me by giving me the nearest cross streets of the Arby's you visited? Also if you can describe the people who took your order and the time you were there that would help quite a bit.

I will make sure we take care of this and hope to hear from you very soon.

Again, my sincerest apologies for letting you down and i hope you will give us another chance. I would like to send you some VIP cards for your trouble and will await your email.

thank you very much, best to you always,

Rick Pascale
Arby's  602-918-8383

Thanks Rick for the prompt attention."}
{"text":"It's an Arby's. You know you're going to get a tasty and relatively plain roast beef sandwich. A tasty Jamocha shake and warm curly fries. No issues at this location the few times I've gone."}
{"text":"Arby's isn't what it used to be, I went thinking of the roast beef of my youth.   It was average at best."}
{"text":"We've stopped here twice in the past few weeks. The employees are super friendly and eager to please. Great restaurant and food. We'll keep stopping by!!"}
{"text":"Just left there. Asst Manager, Dujuan, took great care of me. Great, quick service and very cordial and professional. I'll definitely be back and recommend!"}
{"text":"I love Arby's, but my god this place has the worst customer service in the drive thru. I thought it was a fluke the first time, but unfortunately it was even worse the 2nd time. It was surreal and bizarre just how rude the ladies were who served us. We didn't even have crazy orders and the attitude that was thrown at us was so shocking I thought I was on a hidden camera show. Seriously thought I was on an episode of \"What would you do\".  This place deserves a negative star for service but lucky for them the food is delicious. I would have complained but the manager was RIGHT there and she even looked over at us when we pulled up and LAUGHED and gave us a sneering type of warning like she wanted to pull me through the drive thru window. She even talked badly about us to the customers at the counter inside the restaurant. Hands down worst management and I'm fairly certain if go again I'll get the same disrespect. And sadly it's was truly unwarranted.  Please Arby's check out the management at this location. They are not representing you well.  How they treated me and my family was not a fluke!!!"}
{"text":"I was hungry on a late Monday night, and while I don't eat fast food very often,I have liked Arby's since I was a kid. My neighborhood Arby's happens to share a parking lot with a VERY successful and popular In and Out. Of course the In and Out was 20 cars deep in the drive through, so I decided to get a classic roast beef sandwich from Arby's.  The drive through had 2 cars in it and one was mine. I waited an overly long time, but I imagined it would be fresh.  I paid my bill and headed home to discover there was no sauce for the sandwich in the bag.  I called the manager to complain and he informed me that corporate instructed him to NOT put sauce in the bag unless customers asked for it.  He then said \"I'm not even sure why this Arby's is open.  I think they are going to close it down soon.\"   I told him that they will be closed very soon with this type of customer service.  Note to EVERYONE with Arby's stock...sell it fast!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Triple Thick Brown Sugar Bacon Turkey Club and let me tell you, This sandwiches Favor is out of this World!! Best Club Sandwich for have ever had!!! 

To describe in one word, AMAZING!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was the only one in line. These people are like icebergs. Cold personalities and move so slow you can't see them move. I waited forever for a chicken sandwich that was so burnt it was horrible. Why complain.  The manager was the one who made and served my food! I have very very very low expectations when it come to frozen food served by people who hate their jobs. But this didn't even meet that level. This set a new bar for low. All for almost 9 bucks. And the former meth head taking my order makes 12!"}
{"text":"Not very fast but the staff is nice and some of em kida cute.  They take coupons with no problem.  The condiment/soda bar is always a disaster..messy and out of sauces.  When I dont have sauces...someones gonna get cut!"}
{"text":"This location is clean and convenient but it is a typical Arby's. The sandwiches are all bread not much roast beef or chicken. The sandwiches are thrown together with no 'presentation'. I went to this location twice in the last 30 days and each time the sandwiches (fish, chicken) was served to me at lukewarm temperature. The fish texture tastes like the frozen fish-sticks they served us wayyyyy back in elementary school. The chicken sandwich is horrible. I have had better sandwiches from the frozen food aisle section of the grocery.
I would not recommend this location at all.
Oh wait I forgot to mention, the fries were 'ok'."}
{"text":"There's red sauce in the beef and cheddar. I ask no red sauce please every time they insist there's no red sauce but every time there is like I'm a dummy. I know your food more than your stoned employees."}
{"text":"Oh Arby's! We've came here a few times, mainly because my son has a punch card for free kids meals, and because their happy hour from 2-5 has some good deals. 

The few times we've went, Ive gone inside once and the majority has been in the drive thru... both take forever. Every time I'm in the DT, I get stcuk behind some fat ass dick ordering food for their entire family, plus more. I get it, you don't want to get your lazy ass out of the car, but WTF! Let's hold up the line to order $40 worth of food. Fucked up.

What some people don't understand is that the DT is on a timer, some places have incentives to assure you are delivering quick service to your customers. Alas, here comes Skylar and Brittany ordering one of everything off the menu... COME ON. GET OFF THE CAR AND ORDER INSIDE! I've always thought the DT was for quick items, maybe a bag of food... and if you had more that you needed to order, you walk your ass inside. NOPE. It happens this way everywhere I guess, I don't mind getting my pregnant ass off the car and getting my order, but WTF you can't?

Anyway.

The food here is pretty good, because Brittany just ordered up all the fries, I get the fresh ones. The employees here are hit and miss. The time I did go inside, they were more concerned with the massive DT order to actually acknowledge me and my measly $3 order. So, I get screwed either way! LOL.

Place isn't bad if you're a cheap ass like me, and are willing to wait until they finish up Skylar's $40 order."}
{"text":"I was curious about their Gyro so I got their 2 for $6 promo. Did drive thru & the lady who got my order was very pleasant and courteous. 
I can say different for the gyro. Disappointed. It's not the mediterranean gyro that I expected. I chose the beef (choice of beef, lamb (?) or chicken). On all the gyros I have tasted, the meat is always grilled. This one looks like it was just boiled. If you eat it by itself, it's bland. The sauce tastes just like mayonnaise. If you don't eat it right away, the 'bread' gets soggy from the sauce. 
I wouldn't recommend. Just go to a mediterranean restaurant where you can get good gyros or sraps."}
{"text":"I originally wasn't going to write a review until I looked at my copy of the receipt which was literally seconds ago; I'm a highly dissatisfied customer to say the least. My husband and I have been loyal customers and sadly last night will probably be our last visit. 
I went through the drive thru and ordered 2 roast beef Max's and 2 Jamoca shakes and 1 large curly fry. The lady thought I said \"2 roast beef classics\" I politely corrected her and her exact words were \"what is a roast beef Max where do you see that on the menu?!\" Shocked she would talk to a paying customer like that I apologized I've always called it a roast beef Max nobody has ever corrected me before. (Apparently it's called the half pound roast beef sandwich) so I get past that and go to pay, the total came to $22.59 I wanted to pay $12.59 with cash and the rest on my debit card (it's never been a problem with any of my Arby's orders...until last night) the lady (mid set medium hair it was curly and I think there was some blonde but mostly dark hair) said there is no possible way to pay half cash half card... It was possible all the other times why not last night? She accused me of lying and saying there is no possible way I've done that at an Arby's.. uhm. There is.... I do it all the time. I use my tips from work first then put the rest on my debit card. You just hit the cash button and type $12.59 then it will ask the remaining $10 be paid to which I give them my debit card. It's really not that hard. I asked to speak to her manager and she claimed to be the manager I didn't get her name but she was talking to a gentleman named Austen right next to her who wasn't polite either. I just paid with my debit card, she didn't offer me any catch up or thank me for my purchase so I just left. That was 01/14/18 at about 15:58... Now on 01/15/18 I'm looking at my receipt and one HALF POUND sandwich was $5.99 the other was $5.41 (they both were the exact same sandwich) why the price difference? I'd understand if I was charged a meal and then one just sandwich but they charged me for a large curly fry for $2.29 (and the \"large\" wasn't even half way full) and they charged my 2 Jamoca shakes for $7.18 (which was NOT filled up all the way either) so I was over charged sure only by some change but every penny counts. (I attached the receipt so you could see) overall bad customer service, I'm getting over charged, your employees don't know how to work a basic POS system for me to pay, and my larges aren't filled all the way to the top. More than likely won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Guy in the drive through was nice and I got my food right away. If only the places by my apartment (Stephanie near wigwam) understood the concept of fast food."}
{"text":"Typical Arbys....not dirty which is a plus on this side of town....try new Hawaiian buns better than the original goes good with the roast beef"}
{"text":"Overall: Comparing to other Arby's and fast food locations, the employees make it a very good experience.

Customer Service: 5 stars.  The employees are consistently friendly and seem happy to be there.  They have never messed up an order for me.

Food: 4 stars.  It's one of my go-to places for fast food.  Roast beef, curly fries and Jamocha shake are good.

Prices: 3 stars.  It's not cheap compared to other fast food.  The large roast beef is $5."}
{"text":"How can you get a Oder wrong when I'm the only customer in the store.
Walked in at 3 pm absolutely no one in the store or drive thru ordered 2 beef a cheddar and received2 regular 
Were is the Cheddar"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Arbys but had to stop in for that Deep fried turkey sandwich, which was delicious. Perusing over their website, it looks like Arby's is trying to grow up. If you would of asked me if I wanted to go to Arby's 5 years ago, I would of passed. Now, it looks like Arby's is trying to compete with Subway; while at the same type trying to find its niche. 

If you look at the nutrition menu, you will see why 10 out of 10 doctors recommend staying away from processed meats (sodium content). It is fast-food and you have been warned; if anything, at least drink you're water."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I definitely would... The staff didn't know their own menu,  flies all around, the lady that ordered after us got her food first,  my husband goes up for my shake and my salad is dropped on the floor and put right next to his sandwich as they were going to serve it to us anyway!! He then asks for a refund and guess what they don't know how to give a refund.... Right! Then preceeded to ask if we wanted them to make a new salad, twice! Finally,  what appeared to be a \"manager\"who watched the whole thing acted oblivious to the whole situation! Needless to say they couldn't put the money back on or card so he just gave us cash and said \"I'll have a talk with them\" not even am I'm sorry.... Horrible Arby's will never be back to any Arby's!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Food made incorrectly. Restaurant was dirty. What else is there to say. Avoid this Arby's at all cost!"}
{"text":"The worst place ever. Everything is always broken, there's always a terribly long wait, and the employees are some of the most lazy human beings ever. I kid you not, I have been there 3x and all the 3x I left without ordering anything because \"the shake machine is not working\", it will take about 10 min to make tenders. I mean good lord, it's like 3 in the afternoon... not 5 min before you close! Don't waste your time here... so frustrating."}
{"text":"This is the best Arby's that we have ever been to. The customer service is spectacular.  The food is ALWAYS, fresh and hot. One of the workers, I think her name is Cecilia,  just gave us the best customer service I have ever had I las vegas.  We will always come back. I highly recommend this Arby's."}
{"text":"Customer service in this restaurant should be an example to all! Great team! The manager really took care of another customer, because of a long ticket time caused by a different customer, and my cashier/associate was so incredibly friendly and helpful! It is really refreshing to see."}
{"text":"The new Arby's in Sun Prairie is very clean and the staff seems very friendly and fast! I tired the King\"s Hawaiian Fish sandwich today and it was DELICIOUS! This will be my go-to place for Fridays during lent."}
{"text":"when they had a general manager by the name of thomas, this was one of the best quick service restaurants around! he always knew his external guests, and went the extra mile to make sure everything was wonderful! now~~~ i will bever be going back to this location. i will travel to the other franchise in north gilbert road just south of guadalupe road. i also went to the riverview location, which states that they are a training location. at riverview, the crew member was drinking out of a cup without a lid and straw which maricopa county heath would not like!!! it was just way up too tight went you went in there!!! the training manager needs to \"make some fun\" happen there!!! also, the crew member did not know that you can \"max\" the number one combo.

now back to mckellips~~~

looked like the area manager was washing the outside windows. he should have seen the lobby and the men's restroom and finally the front foyer!!! very disappointed!!!!! I do have pictures which I could add to this review if I knew how! I will be contacting Arby's Guest Services. Really, I could write more, but how can this location change? When you give any location a total of FOUR TRIES, it is time to come to an agreement to SEPERATE from each other. GOOD LUCK if you go there, and hopefully the situation there will change soon!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped today (12/2/17), for lunch. We ordered sandwiches and a Farmhouse Salad to share. When the order was ready, my husband asked for 2 forks. The lady behind the counter says \"we don't have any forks\" and handed my husband 2 spoons! Now there is a Safeway store right next door. Maybe when she realized they were getting low on supplies, someone could have run next door or maybe she could have told us before we bought the salad?? The lack of intelligence is amazing."}
{"text":"i don't usually go to Arby's, but after driving by and smelling the smoker, I knew i'd have to at least try it.  The Smokehouse Brisket sandwich is only seasonal right now, so you have to get is before its gone.  It was good, a cut above the usual Arbys fare.  it came on a premium bun that was soft and fresh, and the flavor of the brisket was pretty good, and the Arby's sauce made for a passable BBQ sauce.  Certainly more than I expected.  Granted, this brisket is not on par with any BBQ restaurant worth their salt, but works just fine for a fast food sandwich.

My wife had the Pecan Chicken Salad, another seasonal delight that makes Arbys  worth going to once in a while.  She loved it as usual, with its soft wheat bread and even fresh tasting chicken salad.  The drive through guy was nice and helpful, and an add bonus, our order was right the first time.  I'll be back as long as they have Smokehouse Brisket and Pecan Chicken Salad"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TROUGH THE DRIVE THROUGH!!! If you go through the drive through you are greated with the smell of absolute shit. Smells like there an open sewer right at the drive through entrance. The food is really good though,  it's just that the sewer will make you loose your appatite."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and hot.
 Staff were nice. It's also very clean and the largest Arbys I've been in."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast drive thru service, and our order was right. What more could you want in a fast food place?"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. $20 for two combo meals.  10 minute wait for day old fries and sloppy sandwiches. 1 star for the nice night manager who handled my complaint but I won't be back to redeem my fries. 
Going to taco bell so I can have something to eat for dinner. Don't waste your money here, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Slow, Terrible service today. Just got back home. Went through the drive thru. Had coke all over the cup so I ask Stacie if she could wipe it off and she rolled her eyes and used her hand. Didn't get it so I asked again. Same exact thing, 3rd time same thing and shoved the coke out the window still covered in soda. She Walked back and made a comment to the cook. I won't be eating these sandwiches or returning for our weekly lunch."}
{"text":"I am never coming here again ... worst customer service ever, Katie the manager at the time was working the drive thru. I got there before they were closing & she told me they were closed. I told her it wasn't 11 yet & she said on her clock they were closed & then I asked why if it's not 11 yet. She gave me an attitude & proceeded to take my order & told someone in the kitchen to microwave an old sandwich instead since they were closing & then turned off her mic as if she didn't want me to know or hear. She continued to give me an attitude & I called back after I left. She told me she was tired because she had been working & that's why she was rude. If your job requires good customer service & you can't provide that why are you even working there? No one wants to eat or even wait on their food when someone is unnecessarily rude."}
{"text":"This arbys is a pretty good one to go to. The food is always hot and fresh! The workers are always kind and will deliver your food to your table if you are already sitting down too. I'm a big fan of their Hawaiian bun sandwiches along with their chicken sandwiches. It's not my first choice for a meal but if you are looking for something quick and easy and you like roast beef then this is the place to go. The only \"bad\" thing about this place which I wish they would have is a drive thru since it is a fast food place."}
{"text":"The Pecan Chicken Salad Flatbread is advertised verbatim on their website as \"Don't let the name fool you: The Pecan Chicken Salad Flatbread is still a sandwich. It's got bread--a pillowy pita.\"  I was served a cheap tortilla."}
{"text":"3rd time here and they have messed up the order every single time! Check your bag before you leave to make sure you have everything!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and fresh cooked. Although they had very minimal drink selections and half of the drinks were not working. They were also out of straws and 1 size cup tops. We asked them to fix this and they did not. The service was very fast. The restaurant itself was dirty and very slippery considering it is winter. The staff was ok although they have some very old people working there. My experience was ok at best"}
{"text":"Had the Market Fresh Club and Reuben Sandwiches: very tasty, but somewhat pricey. 

Can't lose with the Jamaica Shake."}
{"text":"I'm not one to crave Arby's much but I swung by at 10:15pm on a Friday. (They close at 11pm says the sign) I couldn't use the drive though because a cop had its vehicle blocking it with its lights on. I drove around back and the speaker said their headsets are down so pull up to window when ready. I did. Someone saw me but no one helped. Waited, nothing still. Disappointed but I'll live. Just wanted to share my experience."}
{"text":"When I'm in the area I usually visit this Arby's, as it's the only one I ever pass. I normally go through the drive thru, but today I decided to go inside. BIG mistake! The bathroom wasn't ok. I've seen a lot better, but have also seen worse. I asked for the new turkey and bacon sandwich. The one that's supposed to have their new triple thick bacon. The young lady at the front register did not know what I was talking about. When I pointed to the picture behind her, she pointed to every turkey sandwich except the one I wanted to order. A man came over and helped her find the meal. When she rung me up, I pointed out the fact that the price was incorrect from what was displayed. She looked at me as if I had six heads and continued to ask for the third time if my order was for here or to go. I paid for my order and informed her she may want to tell the manager the register is charging more for the meal than what is pictured. She looked at me blankly and asked for the next person. I waited for my food. When they realized my sandwich was made with tomatoes, a man, who looked like the manager, stated \"is it ok if I just take the tomatoes off or are you allergic?\" When I informed him I was allergic, I felt as if I was being an inconvenience. Even though they were the ones who made it incorrectly. When I received my sandwich, I looked at it. To my surprise there was tomatoes on the sandwich. And no turkey. The other customer who was waiting looked and realized I had his sandwich. I felt so bad, as I had touched the sandwich with my hands. The guy was nice and said 'I'm sure my hands have been in worse places than yours have.' He was the highlight of the experience. When I received my sandwich it was tossed on my tray. I didn't make a scene or say anything else. Since apparently when the customer speaks, what they say fall on deaf ears. I was very disappointed in the experience I had when entering this Arby's. Usually Arby's is pretty good, this one, not so much. In short, if you have to visit this Arby's I would recommend you go through the drive thru. You'll have a better experience."}
{"text":"We went at 0959 in the morning. The guy refused to take our order and said,\" we're closed.\" So my spouse asked if they were open in a minute or open tomorrow and the guy never answered. Needless to say we didn't eat there. He couldn't even take our order or be polite."}
{"text":"On 11-17-2017 I went through the drive through around 10:15 p.m. a very rude and inconsiderate Spanish lady took my order through the loud speaker in which I felt very rushed she had a tone with her voice every time I would tell her my order mind you I only ordered one single meal I didn't want to push her patience she seemed like she was on her last straw, barked my total at me through the speaker which was 9 dollars and some change now I knew this wasn't right for what I had ordered so I asked her at the window if she could confirm my order and she looked and me like I was dumb as if I had ordered the meal wrong, no sweet heart maybe if you just payed attention to the person ordering instead of trying to rush them through and get on with your night we wouldn't even be having this conversation so needless to say she didn't get my order right which is why my total wasn't correct either, no worries! She fixed it regardless after I told her face to face my order as I looked her in the eyes, I get home and find one marinara sauce for my 6 piece mozzarella sticks, yeah that's plenty of sauce for 6 pieces, yeah right, she was just a rude person in general I have a lack of respect for people who can't at least just act nice or like they don't hate their job for the 5 minutes I have to interact with them, by the way there was not a single person in the lobby or the drive through so it wasn't a need for speediness or rushing she is just a rude and unhappy individual, please have a discussion with this lady about customer service because although I'm not the cause for you working at a fast food joint at the age of 45 thats all on you sweetie maybe you should have done better with your life and you wouldn't be as unhappy as you are, have a great day!!"}
{"text":"Closed the doors to the lobby 35 minutes early, had to come through the drive through to get marinara sauce for 6 piece mozzarella sticks they never gave me, not only that but she charged me for each item separately"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch during work one day last week, and almost ordered the beef and cheddar combo that I know I love, but saw the three cheese and bacon combo.  I was leery about getting it because I hadn't tried it yet, and because it was going to be over $9 for a small combo!  I got it and was not happy.  The sandwich didn't have much taste and was only slightly warm.  Also, the fries looked like they were the ones left over in the bottom of the basket, as none of them were any longer than an inch.  For some reason, at this location, I never get the curly fries that are actually long and curly, just broken, short fries.  I was still hungry after my meal.  $9 (including tax) for this meal is certainly not worth it.  I will also think twice about getting fries here again, if things don't change."}
{"text":"Walked in Jan 17 @1:45pm, 2 people waiting, 2 in drive thru and they were overwhelmed! 4 employees working. First, the employee in the back gave me a dirty look, for what? I don't know!  Waited at least 5 minutes. Not a soul greeted/explained/apologized for the wait. Walked out after blatant disregard for a customer.  FUCK your MEATS!  I don't need excellent  service, just some kind of service or acknowledgement.  Good food, go to another Arby's..."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened here, but over the last 6 months or so this Arby's location has gone to shit. I used to come here fairly often, but then the service was horrible few months back and I had been avoiding. I just recently tried it again and the quality and service are majorly lacking. It's sad to see one of your \"go-to\" places end up as a place you will never go again, all because these poor excuses for employees can't handle the job they were hired for. And worse, they remain employed!"}
{"text":"One horrible order i had ever made! Lady who took my order is mean and terrify me with her rudeness. At least be nice and take the dam order but why have to be so mean! I was nice the whole way through but i never seen a terrible service like this. Terrible and horrifying place to order food!!! Rate :(0) if i could . She ruined my day."}
{"text":"Decent food for fast food but omg are they slow af!!!! Waited in line in the drive through for 20 mins and I was the second one in line"}
{"text":"TL;DR: The cashier stole $10 from me and nobody cared. 

I went through the drive-thru and placed an order that was $10.03. I paid with $20.03. I did not receive change. I asked for it, and a different employee said it was already given to me. I gave him the receipt and said that I did not. I pulled over and the assistant manager came out after a few minutes. She said that my order was placed during a shift change, she counted the drawer three times, and the employee who took my order was actually $5 short and \"she'll have to pay that out of pocket\". I'm sorry, that sucks, but I don't care. I want my $10. The assistant manager said that there was nothing that she could do due to the drawer not being over, and told me to call the store at closing time after her manager did the final count. Called 5 times at closing time, no answer. Called 3 times the next morning, no answer. Wow, cool. I'm not going to continue this headache and waste my time over a mere $10, but this is absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"I went into Arby's today to try the BLT they are advertising as 2 for $6.00.  I ask to order just one as it was just for me.  The counter person ask the shift supervisor how much one would cost.  Her snippy answer was $6.40 for one.  I ask is the correct and was told yes!  I said thanks and left never to return again."}
{"text":"It's been here forever,  Staff is usually pretty friendly I am glad it survived I would'nt say I am a frequent roast beef consumer but once in awhile I need my fix. 

 Love the Jamocha Shake
An Arby's original that's as delicious now as it was in 1964. Thick and creamy ice cream blended with the perfect combination of chocolate and coffee flavors."}
{"text":"I used to go here in the past but not anymore. EVERYTIME I ate here, I felt terrible. If you want a body cleanse, go here."}
{"text":"Shroom & Swiss!  Is what I tried the other day at this Arby's.  I was sort of in a rush to get somewhere but did not feel like cramming the usual fast food fare into my mouth.  There was a bit of a line, but it was worth the wait since they make the sandwiches to order and none are left baking under a heat lamp.

The staff was nice and friendly and the dining room was kept pretty clean.  Ample parking is available for the location..... it's a bit hard to get to, but you end up turning left through a double yellow line if you are heading down Kings (toward CMC) with the BestBuy & Trader Joe's on your right hand side.

The register displays what you order on an lcd screen right in front of you so there's less of a chance of it getting messed up along the way."}
{"text":"Thank you miss Victoria for such wonderful customer service, you will make an amazing manager one day. Thank you once again and I hope your here every time I come into this arbys."}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I do not go to Arby's on my own, my husband loves this place and I will go here on occasion with him. 

With that being said though, I did end up signing up for their email alerts because I figured if my husband was going to eat here so often it would be good to get some deals on the food. They do send out some pretty decent coupons every once and awhile. PLUS - they sent me a FREE milkshake coupon for my birthday. I decided we had to go a few days ago so I could redeem my coupon.

First off this location is in the ghetto on Boulder Highway. Luckily, the restaurant itself is actually quite clean and well kept. The lobbies in Arby's tend to look a little more \"swank\" (HA HA) than most other fast food establishments. They have mood lighting and cooshy benches to sit on while you dine. 

Second - We went and their shake machine was out of business. *womp womp womp*. The entire reason I came was busted, but of course, my husband still wanted a sandwich. We ordered one and a side of Mozzarella Sticks. I know it's just fried cheese and how bad is fried cheese for you? \"Really bad Ashley\" says my inner organic-food-voice. BUT I don't care. I love fried cheese dipped in marinara sauce! 

Plus the manager here was very nice and offered us two free drinks since I couldn't use my coupon and she was willing to write on my coupon so I could use it at a later date. However, my coupon was not on the verge of expiring so I just said I would come back later."}
{"text":"As another recent review has said, this place appears to have been cleaned up and turned around a bit since its initial reviews from a few years ago. I wouldn't eat off the tables, of course, but it isn't dirty and gross. This location isn't anything amazing and, sometimes, the customer service is a little cold, but they are always speedy and there have actually been maybe a couple times when the cashier was very friendly to me. I usually grab a bite here before heading on the Van Galder bus down to Chicago, or if I'm coming back up and I'm too hungry to wait for food, and it has never disappointed me. You get what you expect here; simple as that."}
{"text":"I love Arby's and this location is never skimpy with the meat on the sandwich.  They are super friendly to me and my dogs.  What other fast food restaurant gives your dog (when you are going through the drive through) a bone!"}
{"text":"It had been a while since I had visited an Arby's, but I stopped in here on a recent road trip. The attendant helped me order by giving me some off menu ideas to help my cravings. She was very friendly and helpful. It took a little longer than I expected for the food to be prepared, but it was delivered to our table hot and fresh. We ordered some turnovers, but they gave them to us cold. We asked for them to be warmed which they gladly did. The location was clean and seemed to be running smoothly. My only negative comment is that someone who appeared to be a manager did not look very happy and in the middle of my meal I heard her tell a worker that she needed to be careful or she would have to write her up. I felt like that should have been something addressed in the back office away from the employees and customers."}
{"text":"Manny from modern family was here"}
{"text":"We had valid/current coupons that the clerk blatantly and fraudulently refused to honor. Their customer service was unresponsive when we complained. As of May 8, 2016 Preeti Mehta, Consumer Protection Specialist for Attorney General Mike DeWine, writes \"We are awaiting a response from the supplier and are in the process of following up with them.\" To date they have been unresponsive to this Ohio Attorney General complaint I wrote early in 2016, RE: Complaint #: 862194. On the food side of things their roast beef sandwiches have consistently tasted like cheap stale pork. Avoid Arby's. They are clueless about customer service much less honesty."}
{"text":"The staff here is usually good with orders and the food tastes as it should for Arbys. Good value for fast food. A nice change if you're used to eating the rest."}
{"text":"I haven't ate at Arby's in a long time because sometimes I get really tired of eating the same thing. Tonight I ran out of ideas about quick food, I didn't want to go inside any where and I remembered that Arby's had different items on their menu. So this is where I decided to eat, I got the turkey market sandwich with the loaded baked potato. The homemade chips and a jr ham and cheese for my little girl. Also the molten lava cake, now I use to make these cakes in school and they were always good so I thought I would give this one a try. Well lets just say I was really impressed the market sandwich is always good, the loaded potato was the highlight of the new experience they put Wendy's potatoes to shame. I hope this will become a regular on the menu, the lava cake was better than I thought it was going to be , I thought it would be dry but it was moist and gooey. Over all I am very impressed the only down part was that the guy at the window gave me exactly 3 napkins for two orders....lol I'm beginning to think that there is a conspiracy going on with condiments and napkins I think all fast food places share...lol. But other than that it was good the staff was pleasant. I'm good believe it or not"}
{"text":"Vouchers again. 4 roast beef sammys for $5.xx so good deal. My friend tells me for fast food apparently the price for the food is a step up? I was not a fan of sandwiches much until our recent holiday to d.c., the homemade can't be beat but this place does have a nice chicken sandwich. Service was so nice! Bahn mi is still my favorite. But the meat here really is good quality :)"}
{"text":"Don't walk in after dark and expect to not get an attitude. Don't be fooled by the closing times being midnight, the employees here check out by 9pm."}
{"text":"I do not patronize fast food places very often, but after having lunch at Panera down the road, and leaving still hungry (and thirsty), and tired from sitting in a meeting (running on little sleep), I was passing this place on a very warm, and sunny winter day, and said to myself, I haven't had a Jamocha Shake in years, so I pulled in and ordered one from the drive-thru.  As I remembered them, they had a more pronounced flavor of coffee and mocha, but this one didn't seem to have that same taste, and they made it more fancy with whipped cream, and chocolate drizzle, which is not really what I wanted.  It was O.K., but I didn't care for the new style of making these, and it was probably way more calories than I should've had . . . I want the old Jamocha back . . . oh well, first world problems.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place was always good. Not anymore. I couldn't eat this food and I can eat anything when I'm hungry. Whoever worked today has no standards. The management must not oversee or care. There are not Alot of Arby's so it's a shame I don't have this one to go to. Fail for Arby's everywhere. Lol"}
{"text":"I was in between errands and in a rush so I stopped here for a take out order.  Good stuff here.  This location was recently renovated and it looks great.  New exterior and signage.  I like the new layout of the dining area.  I could see the meat slicer in motion in the back kitchen going non stop keeping up with the lunch rush orders.  Staff was courteous, crew was on top of orders and the fryer guy kept the baskets of potato cakes, onion rings and fries going.  

In my opinion, Arby's has the best fast food french fries.  No one, not even the golden arches, can touch these curly fries.  My roast beef sandwich was hot and fresh.  I asked for horsey sauce and she threw a fist full of packets in my bag.  I can use the extras later. :)

This is a good Arby's.  The staff is on top of getting orders ready quickly.  My food was hot and staff was nice.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Eaten here a bunch of times normally pretty good. 
 If you try to sub a meat on their new Meat Stacked Subs, they will say sure but not tell you until after you pay its 2 bucks extra for the meat you are subbing. Which is a poor business practice , extremely poor. 
  The guy at the register said salami costs more than ham. So that means I could have still had ham on the sandwhich and paid 2 bucks for salami and made it a 5 Meat. 
 There is also no military discount at this Arby's there is a police discount but no military. 
 Really don't care it the discount would be a little just care that it's not recognized. 
 
 My advice use their coupons all the time. Don't pay full price. Arby's is not doing well anyway in the market place. I can see why every little thing is money. 
 There hardly a soul here when we pass by or stop in."}
{"text":"wonderful place. Good server. The crispy chicken is sooo good for Asian people!! I need write down more and can post. Whatever:)!!!everything is good..hahhah"}
{"text":"I asked for the cheapest possible item I could buy.  Not the cheapest item on the menu, but literally the cheapest possible charge they can generate for me.  Why?  I have a Bank of America offer where if I may a purchase at Arby's I get some bonus $.  I was in a strange mood and decided to go for it, since BoA is giving me at most $2 I want to spend under $2.  A slider is $1.50 plus tax, that isn't going to be enough - guess what: you can buy Arby's cheese in a plastic to-go ketchup container for $.70.  I was hoping to find something at $.50 or below.

The first person wasn't sure what was the cheapest, but she was wise enough to know her limits and asked her manager who knew about the side of cheddar.  For this I am happy.  I can't give four stars because of the following problems:
1) Parking lot is full of holes and is really treacherous;
2) It is difficult to get to this location (lots of annoying left turns);
3) The place doesn't look very clean;"}
{"text":"Crap restaurant with terrible service. You're better off at the McDonald's or Taco Bell across the street."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service at the drive through and the same amazing, greasy, over-seasoned curly fries you can get at any location. And did you know they have LOADED curly fries now?! I didn't. But I'm glad I noticed them on the menu. The girl told me they would be loaded with cheese sauce, shredded cheese and bacon. That sounded good to me and boy was it! I couldn't believe the bacon was real! Not those crappy little bacon bits, but actual big pieces of bacon strips. Next time I have another ridiculous cheat day, I'll totally pick up another!!"}
{"text":"Very clean was greeted by employees, the very young cashier wasn't in the greatest mood, other than that it was great experience, had the chicken & ham slider & potato cakes all wonderful as usual. 

    There were 2 older ladies who spilled their drinks it was quickly mopped up by the employees, employees then quickly got refills for them, manager came out speaking to all of the patrons asking if everything were fine with our meals, I really appreciated that she took the time out of her busy schedule to approach each one of us, when I say busy  line was almost out the door cars almost out by the lot entrance, keep up the great job..."}
{"text":"Good and fresh. Arby's is still one of those places you can get fast food that is pretty good quality in the world of fast food. Their staff is always friendly and eager to please. The new cookies they have are so good, and my old stand by the beef and Cheddar is still a winner in my book. Glad I live so close."}
{"text":"Like most other well run Arby's. Tasty sandwiches, not exactly bargain priced but coupons available from time to time.

Free parking and good service."}
{"text":"A good place to get your Arby's fix. I have a soft spot for the Arby's roast beef. I think its unique taste and texture is related to how thin they slice the meat.

For the last couple years at least, the backside of the receipt gets you a free regular roast beef on the next visit if you call in or take the web survey within two days.

Good and friendly service, free parking lot make this relatively unique for fast food in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"We frequently visit this Arbys. At  least once a week. Drive thru is quick and painless. It seems like the jr roast beef get smaller and smaller every week. We still love the roast beef and this arbys never screws up my order."}
{"text":"If you happen to go in while the 'manager' Kevin is working, leave immediately. He is the most vile human being I ever met. He is the best manager there is and he is always helpful if you have any question. Oh and ask him for the \"secret\" sauce. He will know what you are talking about ;)."}
{"text":"The food was tainted by the filthy carpeting. If the eating area looks like this I wonder about the kitchen. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ohh deer! My friend sent me a link about the Arby's limited time venison sandwich promotion which piqued my interest in eating here. It had been forever since I'd actually hoofed it over to one so I figured it was time to try them out again! 

I high-tailed it over here after calling to confirm they still had venison left. I had heard from another Yelper that in some locations they only had 100 sandwiches at their Arby's and I didn't want my experience here to be a McDonald's Szechuan sauce fiasco. 

I entered the store and glanced at the limited time promotion sign, pointing to it all doe-eyed. 

\"I'll have two of the venison sandwiches please!\"

The sandwiches themselves were pricey, $8 each. But would they buck the trend of Arby's food infamy? While I waited for my food I pondered this as I grabbed a few packets of horsey (Or deery?) sauce from the stag-gering well-stacked piles of condiment packets. My order was made in a few short minutes and I was on my way home to indulge in a dash of Dasher, Donner and Blitzen! (Prancer, Comet, Cupid, Vixen and Rudolph were unavailable for comment)

The sandwich was nicely packaged in a cardboard box. The bun had a cross shape on top and the slab of venison looked like a decent size. There were a small amount of fried onions in it and the meat was coated in a juniper berry sauce that tasted more like a juniper flavored ketchup. The actual taste of the venison was like a mineral-infused, lean slightly chewy beef. Overall it was OK, for me the meat wasn't very gamey tasting but the meat did have some more stringy pieces that I had to really work on chewing through.

It's not a meal I would fawn over, but I do appreciate that Arby's decided to sell a venison sandwich and I'm glad I tried it so in that aspect I find it en-deer-ing! (I hope their next offering isn't Bambi brulée or Deery Lou stew)"}
{"text":"They had a rough start when they were new, but now they have an awesome and professional crew. Past 4 times I've been there for lunch the drive-thru crew was really on top of things. Fast, and the order was perfect. We usually order just two roast beef sandwich combos. So far, they never scrimp on the meat and it's always cooked just right."}
{"text":"My brother who now works across the street suggested we try this location again because it looked like a lot of cars were there at lunch. After over two years and 5 or more bad visits spaced out every few months, we figured it was about time.
The staff wasn't fooling around and giggling this time. They were professional and trying their best. The roast beef wasn't burnt! And the tables were clean! And I'm proud to say we're going to become regulars again. Don't know what was wrong with them before. Maybe it's different management or staff altogether now."}
{"text":"The girl checking us out messed up and gave us something different than our order. Okay no big deal but then when she was talking to us she proceeds to say \"I know I pressed the fucking pancake button\" that's terrible customer service skills.."}
{"text":"A friend wanted to meet here for lunch...  it was like I walked into 1983.  

From a marketing perspective, the ambiance simply failed.  The materials used in building the dining room and restrooms was passable in 1970, not in 2015.  There was peeling laminate that had clearly been glued many times.  The restroom walls were that purposely bumpy textured material that you used to see in old mobile homes that had also been repainted many times over the years.  Their color pallet revolved around this grimy blue/grey color and cream.  How is that representative of Arby's?  Bad, just really bad all the way around.  I thought about the carpet and how old it must be, but I tried not to focus on that or how slippery the dining area floor was.  EW!

Then comes the food.  Wow.  I ate a few curly fries and threw my $8.00 chicken bacon swiss in the trash.  The chicken didn't taste right and had a weird texture.  I'm not 100% sure it was ever a real chicken.  Considering that their current promotional tag line is \"We have the meats...\", I was kinda shocked by the low quality chicken I was served.  I left still hungry of course so had to rush into the QT gas station to grab a fruit cup before hurrying back to work.  I think it's a sad day when a $3 gas station fruit cup is a better option than an $8 sandwich meal.

I guess James Earl Jones is getting all their extra money because every corner that could be cut at this location has already been cut, there's simply nowhere lower to go from where they stand today.  We visited at 1:00pm on a Friday; there were 4 customers inside and 1 car in the drive thru.  They had a \"now hiring\" sign, but I can't imagine what for... based solely on my experience today, I'd recommend closing the doors and trying something else completely."}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering the new chicken salad sandwich.  Two large pieces of whole wheat bread and two wimpy lettuce leaves.  There wasn't even a full cup of chicken salad, maybe just over a half.  Lots of grapes not that much chicken.  Really a disappointment."}
{"text":"The Arby's here is basic like any other. The food was good and the ARBYS sauce that no one knows what it is. The employee Jordan catered to our every need"}
{"text":"I've never taken the time to write a positive review for a \"fast food\" establishment, but this one deserves a tip of the hat. Was passing through Peoria on business with a family member and stopped here for a quick bite. The restaurant was especially clean and well maintained, service was quick, food was good, and the manager \"Mark\" was extremely friendly and even entertaining. There's a bell by the door you can ring on your way out if you had a good experience, which I took advantage of after seeing another patron do it on their way out. Not a typical \"fast food\" experience for me, and thought worth noting!"}
{"text":"Its only an Arbys. So this will only be a quick review.

 No matter where we live in Las Vegas we have an Arbys within a 10 minute drive. Years ago, Arbys left the New York City market. Now that they opened a store in Bellmore, NY; New Yorkers are driving a distance for the Arbys experience. The Arbys of today is a different restaurant than I remember in New York. They greatly eliminated their popular signature menu items for new market fresh items. Maybe the Wendy's merger had something to do with it. Delicious menu items like the super beacon roast beef and cheeseburger (they had delicious cheeseburgers) have been replaced by reubens, roast turkey, and other market sandwiches that remind me more of Wendys. 

Fortunately,  they still serve the beacon cheddar roast beef sandwich. That is my Arby's sandwich of choice. My critique is that they not charge an extra dollar for more roast beef.

  This Arbys shares the parking lot with Pecos Legacy Car Wash. After scrubbing off presents from pigeons and the elements,  eating here is a nice reward for hand washing my car. Thats all I have to say.

Yelp Challenge: Review 41 of 100."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS as in Pretty Good Food:

   When Arby's has their eye on the ball, they hit it out of the ball park. Their limited time King's Hawaiian Brown Sugar Bacon Roast Beef sandwich is a Grand Slam. Further into the Review, it will touch on this sandwich. 

  It had been a hot day in North Las Vegas. After hiking on the Aliante Walking Trail, the urban hike concluded at the Aliante Parkway Arby's. This is not surprising considering that I am a fan of Arby's roast beef. Their roast beef is unparalleled. I have never tasted roast beef similar to Arby's. The only problem is that Arby's doesn't seem to have the same confidence in their roast beef as your's truly. Over the years they have seriously cut back on their roast beef sandwiches while branching out into their line of deli market sandwiches. Gone are some of the delicious Arby's staples that I remember growing up with. While I am on this subject, let me mention that back in the late 1980s, Arby's served a highly underrated burger that was of a high quality similar to what diners serve. Arby's also gave it the axe. And while they were at it they got rid of every Arby's in my home town of Long Island by the time I started college. When I have gotten in the Arby's mood, their beef in cheddar sandwich is my goto food. The limited edition king's Hawaiian Brown Sugar Bacon Roast Beef (abbreviated Brown sugar Bacon from this point forward) sandwich changed that. 

  The picture convinced me to order the medium Brown Sugar Bacon combo for a few cents short of $10. It included the sandwich, curly fries and a fountain drink. The menu's picture reminded me of one of the  deceased Arby's sandwiches coming back from the dead with a new name. Here is a Yelpy question, \" Did the sandwich look the way the pictures showed it?\" My Yelpy answer is that the picture showed more roast beef and less of the lettuce than what was on my sandwich. Regardless, there was a nice amount of that delicious Arby's roast beef between the King's Hawaiian bread buns. Sharing the space with the roast beef were Swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, bacon, and I believe horse radish sauce. From the Arby's condiment station, I poured a couple of cups of Arby's sauce on it. I savoured every bite. The Arby's curly fries went along good with their limited time masterpiece. 

   When my brother and I took in Arby's it was in a very quiet environment. Most of the time we were the only customers until a large family came in. There was a creepy moment when a shady drugged looking character walked in. He stares at the order taker, then is walking slowly towards the soda machine. I thought that there was going to be a robbery going down. But he takes it upon himself to fill up a cup of Coke then leave. In the nicer quiet moments when I wasn't chatting with my brother, it was enjoyable looking across Aliante Parkway toward the Nature Discovery Park where geese were hanging out. 

   After I finished the Arby's food, my post hiking eating adventure was half over. One of the advantages of this Arby's is that it is a short walk to two dessert destinations: Scoops in the Smith's-anchored shopping center and Dairy Queen at the southeast corner of Alienate Parkway and Deer Springs Road. Immediately after Arby's I would treat myself to dessert in Scoops.

  As I headed toward Scoops ice cream, the sweltering sun did not melt my opinion of Arby's. I am still a fan of Arby's that wants to see them return to the basics of their roast beef sandwiches business."}
{"text":"Once upon a time in my hometown of Long Island, New York there was a fast food chain called Arby's. They served Long Islanders delicious roast beef sandwiches and highly underrated cheeseburgers. In the 1980s they were all over Long Island from the New York City streets to the light houses out East. After Jack In the Box left the Island, Arby's took over their locations. In the early 1990's, a few years after Jack left the boxes, Arby's followed suit. By 1992, Arby's had left me but my appetite for their roast beef stayed. In the following years, I would have quick Arby's reunions when I traveled through the Midwest with my brother to ISU in Terra Haute, Indiana. In 2000 when I moved to Orlando , Arby's was back in my life up to 2002 when I moved to Fort Lauderdale. The story would have a new chapter when I moved to Las Vegas, and long and behold, down the street from me was an Arby's by a Jack In the Box. If only smartphones and Yelp were around in September 2004 to capture these moments. 

    Throughout my years living in Las Vegas, I have been reliving the taste of the roast beef that I enjoyed growing up as a Long Islander. Before joining Yelp in February, 2011 when Border's was the brick and mortar social media of its time, I would visit this Arby's. After a  half decade since dining in this location, it was time to return. 

    This location is battered with negative reviews. Fortunately, my visit just like the pre-Yelp Era ones was pleasant. I stepped inside the lobby around 7:00 pm. There was one man ahead of me and the clerk apologized to him for the wait. The clerk was friendly. My order was complete in a satisfactory time period. 

     The discouraging aspect of the 2016 Arby's experience to the one I would be yelping in 1984 is that they cut a lot of their roast beef selection and totally eliminated the underated cheeseburger. Gone are the super roast beef and other Arby's staples that I recall. In my opinion they have reduced the bread and butter of their business by moving into deli sandwiches and other areas. Disparate from the Arby's before the Millennium, the company is now Wendy's owned. Fortunately, they still serve the Beef and cheddar. Now it is in two sizes, where the classic is the standard meat and the mild has more for an additional dollar bill. I ordered the classic meal and up sized the curly fries and Coke. It came out to around $8. With a nice splash of that one of a kind Arby's sauce, I was savoring the taste of the beef and cheddar. The taste hasn't changed in the past decades. Next time I think I will spend more for the mild size to Really enjoy the sandwich. Near the disappearing roast beef and cheddar between two buns, the curly fries was heading in the same direction. I enjoy their curly fries. They have a unique and delectable taste minus saltiness. Just like Arby's roast beef. 

    Inside the Stephanie Street Arby's , 3,000 miles away from my home town I enjoyed the experience of eating the roast beef that I grew up with. Arby's may have left me in Long Island, but for now they live with me in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas, we take fast food chains such as Arby's, In N Out Burger, and Jack In The Box for granted. In New York, we miss Arby's. Now that Arby's opened their first stand alone store in Long Island, New York after a long absence from the region, people drive far out of the way for the Arby's experience. Fortunately, in Vegas there seems to be an Arby's on every major highway.

   It has been a couple of years that I last ate in Arby's. Today we stopped here on the way to Floyd Lamb Park. By the time I left, I did not take Arby's for granted. I greatly enjoyed the beacon cheddar deluxe and curly fries. This is tasty fast food that I would put in the same fast food A-team as Panda Express and Raising Caines. I plan to visit more Arby's in the near future. I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Really a fan of this Arby's. We stop by here sometimes on the weekends in the middle of the day for a quick lunch bite before going out to our farm. We've been in twice now and never had a delay.

They're usually pretty empty and there's never been much of a wait. The only thing I could really complain about was cleanliness inside. Despite not many people being in line for food, the employees mostly stood around while several tables could use a good wipe down.

We used a couple of coupons that seem to come in the mail once a week. Arby's has really pared their menu down over the past 5 or so years, completely getting rid of some of my favorite items. They at least still have curly fries and mozzarella sticks. These days though, their claim to fame is meat and it is really high quality stuff. Prices can get a bit steep but you certainly get what you pay for. Also, they've recently gotten into the world of gyros and have limited time Mediterranean style gyro with lamb meat. It's seriously about as good as you could ever get from a fast food joint!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service with a smile.  Treated myself to their French dip sandwich and it was perfect. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food, just wish it was not so expensive."}
{"text":"This Arby's always has the nicest employees and best customer service compared to every other day good place. Plus the food is great for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 0 stars.  Every single time I come here and I do mean every it takes about 30 minutes for my food. The slowest Arby's ever. They really need new employees. The managers are ridiculous to. Never asking the guest if they need help they just look at you. Idiots."}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I drive by this Arby's - especially now, as I am moving.  I probably would have driven by once again if I didn't get a text that they are offering some chicken strips for free if you purchase a drink and fries.  So I stopped.  The place was empty.  At least it was clean!

The service at the counter was really friendly.  I was actually impressed that they were able to give me a free order of chicken strips from a text message that I had received about an hour before.  The world is moving along.  Not long ago, people would have just stared at me like I was an alien or something.

I do love curly fries, so that was a no-brainer, and I also ordered the requisite drink to go along with it.  Their \"medium\" is huge.  I wonder why the drinks keep getting larger.

Unfortunately, the curly fries seem to have been sitting out for a while, so rather than being crisp and crunchy, they were just so-so, and the chicken was all breading.  At least I didn't pay for the chicken.

Sweet Tea Report:  The sweet tea was actually really sweet.  I felt like I had eaten a few candy bars.  I almost didn't get a refill.  Almost.  If I hadn't seen the dispenser sitting below the brew pot, I would have sworn they were piping in some sort of syrup to make it that sweet.  But sure enough, it seems like they are brewing it.  Apparently these fast food places are catching on to the secret of sweet tea."}
{"text":"Slowest \"fast food\" restaurant I've ever been to (foolishly more than once). Customer service sub-par as well - stood at the counter waiting to tell someone they gave me the wrong sandwich and I was ignored for a bit."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service given in the drive thru. Miles has a horrible personality and makes sure to show it to the customers. On two occasions I have gone thru this drive they and both time is kid was rude and dismissive. This time I spoke with the manager Rebecca that was completely clueless to the employee issues bc she hides in the back office while the customers have to deal with a long wait and subpar customer service. She had nothing to say when I brought to her attention the employee issue and didn't even offer an apology. She just stood with a dumbfounded look on her face. I do not recommend anyone to this Arby's unless you like horrible customer that may reflect their food prep as well."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for a quick lunch. We ordered without issues. I haven't had Arby's in years. I got a regular roast beef sandwich and curly fries. They were both good and we got our food quickly. I would definitely come back if I ever get a craving."}
{"text":"Delicious, very clean and fast. Gyro was good, curly fries were hot.  Good variety of soft drinks .  Convenient location"}
{"text":"The sandwiches were abnormally small. They were skimpy on the meat. I recommend simply driving a little farther to the next Arby's. There is many in the area."}
{"text":"So Arby's has some classics but as far as quality goes I think most of us can agree, it has gone somewhat down hill over the years; however sometimes you just crave it. 

There are some certain specials I will stop by Arby's for and this one is near my house. The food is not bad and the fact that it seems to take long in the drive-thru I am OK with because I am hoping that means it is fresh! 

Uggg-the employees tho: No matter how nice I am, there is NO trace of happiness in their voice. I actually leave feeling bad for them like 'why do they hate their job and/or life so much?\". It's all mono-tone and almost like 'here, take your food and go..\". 
I don't go looking for cheerful employees I guess, I go for the food and I know working in fast food can suck but there are a lot worse places to work in the world. 
Maybe Arby's needs a better work environment."}
{"text":"You know, I don't write many reviews for the more mainstream places I visit, simply because there are usually so many reviews for these sorts of places, and I'm not always sure my review would add anything new, but I must say, this Arby's location impressed me.

We were looking around for a kid-friendly place to grab a quick bite before watching the Nutcracker at the Benedum, and all of the places around either needed a reservation or had a fairly long wait. We saw this place across Liberty avenue, and decided to try it out. It was immediately apparent that this establishment runs a tight ship.

There were two employees at the registers, despite everyone's orders already being taken, and both greeted me warmly and were friendly during the transaction. Our order was prepared quickly and accurately, and everything seemed very well put together - you know how some fast food establishments sort of throw things together haphazardly - well, this place does NOT do it that way. Fries were fresh and warm, and sandwiches were tidy and well constructed.

The bathrooms smelled and appeared very clean and well taken care of, something we are very aware of, particularly when we are out with our kids. When we went to leave, the cashiers both thanked us for the business and we went on our way. Fresh, fast food in a clean establishment with very friendly employees - this place has it all, and we'll be back! One of the few fast food places I would give a 5-star rating to!"}
{"text":"Super great buffalo chicken sliders. Friendly staff!   I eat here at least once a week because it's so much better than the one close to my home!!!"}
{"text":"I know I'm writing a review of a fast food place, but hey, why not? Free country right?

I absolutely love Arby's.  I thoroughly enjoy coming here for lunch to get some tenders and curly fries or a chicken sandwich with bacon all washed down with a nice refreshing Diet Pepsi.

I cannot say enough about the Arby's Sauce and Horsey Sauce.  I usually get two cups of each for dipping my curly fries in! They're that tasty!

Arby's is one of the few fast food places that serves Pepsi products and Diet Pepsi is rapidly becoming my new favorite Diet soda instead of Coke.

The area is just down the road from where I live.  I only wish that like some fast food places, they stayed open til midnight."}
{"text":"I took my youngest son to lunch. We needed some place quick but good.  He picked Arby's. It has been remodeled in the last year or so it is more contemporary. The dining area and the restroom were clean. We ordered a chicken tender meal and a roast beef sandwich meal. The sandwich was warm and it hit the spot with the addition of a little horsey sauce and Arby's BBQ sauce. The curly fries were hot and had great flavor. The chicken strips were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. We left with full tummies and smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"Way good service, so polite. And accommodating to my picky order! Thanks Arby's!!! (Insert a bunch of heart emojis)"}
{"text":"This location provides horrible service! I waited in the drive through for over six-seven minutes even though there was only one other car ahead of me. My food was cold (especially the curly fries) leading me to believe that they had prepared my food and then left it sitting while they prepared the order for the car ahead of me. No thanks!"}
{"text":"The store manager has gotten to know my mother and myself by name since we frequent there often. Very clean during the day. Sometimes at night it gets dirty but theyre quick on cleaning."}

They need to get new management. It will be a really LONG time before I ever step foot in an Arby's!"}
{"text":"Introduction:
Arby's is one of my favorite go to place when I crave fast foods.  Actually, at least once a week.  However, I haven't been to one almost 3 months now, due to their consistent poor customer experience.  I decided to give it a try here since I haven't been to one in Las Vegas.  Boy, was that a mistake!

Customer Service: Negative trillion 
WOW! I've had bad service and I get it when certain people have bad a day.  But this experience was beyond that. 

I was assisted by a Kenny, from start to finish, this guy just appeared miserable.  One of those individual's that looks at himself in the mirror and thinks to himself \"my goodness, I hate you\"!

I tried saying hello to him cause he looked like he had a bad day.  You would think the common courtesy is to reply back. Nope, I was ignored. When I asked following up questions, he replied in the most unfriendly tone you can't imagine.  I figured I am not going to give up on this miserable Kenny, so I said thank you after I paid, you would think he replied. Nope, I was ignored again. Very sad!

Quality: 4/5
The bread and meat was a little dry on certain areas, but still decent. I am sure it's due to the slow traffic.  Probably from the crappy service, no one wants to be there.

Price: 2/5
Would be 5 stars, since the service is so bad, I felt overpaid.

Atmosphere: 1/5
Kenny brought this down!

Cleanliness: 2/5
There was lots of sticky sauces on the table.  Had the service been good, probably would've been tolerable.

Tips to owner:
Go eat at Chik-Fil-A and take notes on how to hire.

Tips to Kenny:
Life's not that bad, you have a job and you can walk. If you hate dealing with people, get a back office job. Hopefully, you will pass the interview. Smile, life's good if you can walk and talk.  Perception is everything, you are a walking business card, you get 1-2 seconds to impress. 

Tips to customers:
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.  IT CAN RUIN YOUR DAY!"}
{"text":"Regular retail price $20. Paid $12. You should coupon! I go to this Arby's more than the others nearby. The thing that makes this NOT a five star review is that I asked an employee if they had ham and cheese sandwiches and they told me no, they only had ham and cheese in sliders. So you're telling me - you have full sized buns, you have ham, and you have cheese, but you can't make me a full sized ham and cheese sandwich? Dumb. Empower your employees to make decisions outside the limits of your menu!"}
{"text":"Regular retail price $6. Paid $2. Got a coupon from their email club for a free sandwich with the purchase of a drink. Went inside because using a coupon in a drive through is hard to do.

Deceptive advertising if you ask me relative to the amount of meat and the value for the money paid. Where's the beef! Thanks"}

It would be faster for me to go out of my way and drive to the Belmont Arby's than to ever attempt the drive through here again .....

And, I had time to write this whole review while waiting in the drive through ...

Done with you Arby's!"}
{"text":"We ordered mozzarella sticks and marinara for a friend we're going to meet, a double beef n cheddar and an original beef sandwich. The woman that took our order was great... Order was quick and fries were hot so I started at 5 stars with that because that doesn't typically happen with fast food restaurants. Got into the car to travel to our somewhat distant destination and was too hungry to wait so we pulled out our sandwiches- oh hey! Look! They forgot my cheddar. Surprise surprise. Whatever, I got over it. I get an idea thinking, they only screwed up once and didn't forget my friends marinara. Nope, squash that. So much for that. Two stars down, I decided hey, you know what. We have to drive back this way after the couple hours we're out here for so maybe they'll fix this and refund the cheddar so I call. After about 15 rings a woman answers it and says \"hold on a second\" while I get placed on hold. About a minute later my phone gets that sweet click where they hang up on you. So I dropped another star and decided this review was necessary. Thanks for nothing!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical as I was driving up as there were only 2 cars in the parking lot which I assumed belonged to employees. I placed my order and prepared myself to not be completely satisfied, but when I reached my hand in that paper bag, and the curly fries burned my finger tips, I knew I'd made the right decision! My fries and bacon Swiss chicken sandwich were FRESH! There's no name on my receipt. It just says Employee #8; so whoever employee #8 is and also whoever cooked the food, thanks!"}
{"text":"THIS ARBYS IS NOT SANITARY TO EAT AT. I went to Arby's to get just a sandwich and we went through the drive through we got parked just to real fast and it was hard as a rock and stone cold.

They got rid of those too, seemingly in record time!  Apparently, they have switched over to a special 'short attention span menu'!  By the time one ends up discovering and liking something on an Arby's menu, they discontinue it!  And the service is not what it used to be.  Most dissapointing.  They've lost me as a customer."}

{"text":"They close at 8 pm now!!!!!! This is fast food. What a fucking joke!!!!  So upset over this.   Already have filed a formal complaint with corporate. I want a God Damn answer for this. It's unacceptable."}
{"text":"Drive Thru STINKS!!!!! Go in IF you want a half way decent meal. The service has been TERRIBLE at this location for a while. Can't understand how they are still in business. ANY of them for that matter."}
{"text":"I was told it was camel meat.  That's not true.  For a fast food place, they do a consistently good job here.  Many of the employees have been around for a long time, so that says something."}
{"text":"My family stops into this Arby's once in a while. The food is consistently good for what it is, fast food. The staff is usually very friendly and the parking lot is easy to get around in. The only thing that brings the rating down is sometimes it is not as clean as I would like. Also if you are not fortunate enough to get a booth you have to sit in these iron lawn chairs. They are uncomfortable and odd for a indoor seating situation."}
{"text":"Food was great but Everytime I've been in the restaurant it wreaks of urine as soon as you walk in the door. I've been in the women's bathroom once and it was nasty."}
{"text":"Slightly above average location taking into consideration the age of the building these guys are in and the \"neighborhood\"."}
{"text":"This location is somewhat difficult to get in and out of based solely on its location near a busy street. The inside is huge and usually really clean, you can tell they actually care about getting your order right or fixing any issues you have, customer service is very important to them. Service is quick and nice, food was super good. Your basic fast food location, I will eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey gyro meal. I received old curly fries that needed Arby's dipping sauce and my gyro was room temperature. I spent nearly $10 for a meal at it was early, so things should've be fresh and hot. Ready to sell."}
{"text":"Hey it's Arby's or my favorite fast food places. Still a sucker for the roast beef in Arby's sauce. I like the French dip and there is you is pretty good. Also like their new corn beef sliders. Food was what I would expect from an Arby's at this location and I had no issues with the staff. Restaurant could have used all good mopping when I was there on a Saturday, but who was by no means what I would consider dirty and neglected. Almond oil it's an Arby's restaurant"}
{"text":"I like Arby's. The food that I get there as far as fast food goes is good quality I've never had any issue Quest service or food quality at this location or at any Arby's location for that matter. I will be here when I am craving roast beef sandwiches. They're new deli style sandwiches are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Really really bad counter service. Took 4 employees including the manager to figure out one coupon. Manager yelling from the back to her staff. Almost like a Saturday Night Live skit. 4 sandwiches 4 drinks. One shake. No special requests."}
{"text":"From when we first arrived at the Arby's I wasn't sure if it was a good one to eat at as it's not in the best part of town. 
It was nice inside, oddly a small portable boom box was on the counter for music. 

Ordered food with ease, there was some issues. But hey it's fast food."}
{"text":"Every time I go here the roast beef is dry fries are cold unless you get loaded and that's bc they have to melt the cheese. I have went to this location for the last time. Customer service is horrible in the south we say things like hey how are you. How's the weather nothing just take my card let me pay and I left. I love less than 2 mins from there my food shouldn't have been cold or the sandwiches I bought either."}
{"text":"every trip here (Drive-Thru) it's something; incorrect change, rude employees, long wait when there are NO OTHER CARS IN DRIVE-THRU, no sauce/wrong sauce, and of course (as it happened again today); WRONG ORDER!!! seriously. this location has always been terrible. My wife and I visit here maybe 2-3 times per year (over a 10 year span), and always cringe when we drive-thru. **IF YOU MUST HAVE YOUR ARBY's FIX HERE, please go inside and eat. That way they can fix any problem you may experience. Odds are (it is Vegas) you will!!! *Note: the food is always pretty good, just wish the service was..."}
{"text":"I already called the corporate number and gave feedback to the corporate web site. I gave a scathing review of the Sandbar in Chandler a few months ago and after a while changed it cause I felt bad about the effect it had on some employees. Guess what. Don't give a rats ass anymore. We fire people at my place of employment when they can't cut it. Why should we tolerate from the food service industry incompetence that we would not tolerate in our own place of work. If you hired someone to paint your house, repair a dent in your car, or cut your hair, and they did a horrible job, would you pay them?  Fast food is one of the few things not bought off the internet we pay for in advance. 99% of us would do nothing other than a cursory check of our food bag before we drive off and hope the sandwich inside was what you ordered. I encourage everyone o spread the word and start standing up for yourself. If you get a crap deal from fast food, don't just take it because our expectations are low. Call or write the corporate offices  maybe if enough people get on board something someday may change. It's not like we aren't paying the same price as we would at a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Walked in, saw 2-3 people in line when we arrived... Figured shouldn't be too long. Walked out of there 15 minutes later with now 8 people waiting... Did not want to go there to begin with but my coworker did because of being on a budget.... So I bit the bullet and reluctantly went, 3 of the 5 people that came in after us left well before we did... Will not return to this one. I'd give negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"We were driving by and decided to stop at this Arby's. It looks like it's in a pretty new building and location in town. This is in a strip mall with some other establishments. The inside and exterior of the building still smell like new construction. It was super clean inside and their were quite a few staff working while we were there (mostly high school aged workers). Service was friendly when we ordered. We decided to try their fish sandwiches that were on sale 2 for $5 and a large curly fry (love, love, love the curly fries at Arby's). Our food came out pretty quickly, which should have been a flag. My fish patty (once frozen) was still cool inside the standard bun. EEEK! One bite and no amount of anything was going to get me to take another bite. I focused on the fries at that point. I tried the fries with horsey sauce, arby sauce and ketchup (variety is the spice of life, why not for your fries too?).  My companion's flat bread fish sandwich was made to order and not cool inside. I need to go with what I know and get the roast beef sandwich next time. I have learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Just commenting on this location as a fast food chain only.

The exterior has just been renovated and it seems as if the management has made significant strides in making this chain location much more reliable when it comes to food consistency.  I work close by and stopped going because of inaccuracies and just plain out bad food.  I can say its gotten much better.

Again, this is only comparing this Arby's location compared to others."}
{"text":"Cashier was rude and had attitude.  It was like he didn't want to be at work.   And upon leaving all I heard the two males employees talking about \"getting a \"hot pocket\" and not sandwich.\"

That was disgusting to hear and won't be coming back to this Arby's."}
{"text":"This location is always clean, the employees are friendly and always willing to help. I know it's fast food but the service is outstanding and the food is fresh and high quality. Lots of great choices and there is always a coupon to be had."}
{"text":"Food was good! However, the male working the drive thru speaker and back window was so sarcastic and rude.  I went at around 10/11 am this morning. I have never experienced a cashier who clearly hated his job to this degree. And I get it, working fast food sucks.. I did it for years.  However i would have been fired if I had the attitude that this person had.  I don't expect a beaming smile or to be treated like a queen, especially at fast food. But cmon, extreme sarcasm and rudeness is just uncalled for, especially when I wasn't a rude or difficult customer in the least."}
{"text":"Stephanie started us off with 5 star service. Smiling, funny, efficiently correcting our order when we changed our minds. Ok, I changed mine. She went with the flow and didn't have any issues using the register as so many do.

They got knocked down a star because the tables were dirty and they were out of napkins.

They got knocked down another star because we waited for what seemed like forever. We were on our way to an event and figured that 30 minutes would be plenty of time to get our fast food and get to the venue up the road. After 20 minutes, I sent my husband up to the counter to find out if they had forgotten us. We didn't even get our drinks. They told us it would be another couple of minutes, and it was. 

While we were eating, they lost all of the rest of their stars and even dipped into the negative as I was embarrassed to hear what I can only assume was the manager publicly berate Stephanie. I wasn't able to hear everything he said, but I heard the poor girl say back that she was the only one up front during the rush. I can contest that she was. I saw a bunch of staff members in the back, but nobody helping her. she even had to go back and drop the fries after ringing us up. Management 101: Do not publicly discipline anyone, ever. It looks bad on you, demotivates the employees, and alienates your customers. I was embarrassed for her and embarrassed for everyone in the restaurant. I wish I could have seen this person so I could report who he was.

They got their two stars back because the food was absolutely delicious. A few tweaks in training and possibly a full staff and they would be a 5 star Arby's - as long as they keep Stephanie."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich very good in taste but like a lot of Arby's food serving is very small for cost!"}
{"text":"This location is right down the street from where I live, which is great because who doesn't love curly fries? 

I have been here, dined in as well as drive through, about 5 times. Four of those times were excellent. The place was clean, staff was friendly, food was perfect. 

Today my mom and I decided we wanted curly fries so we drove through for lunch. We got home and sat down to eat and our sandwiches were SO full of sauce we couldn't even eat them without making a huge mess. 
I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it had so much mayo and buffalo sauce on it my bottom bun was soggy and falling apart. I even tried to scrape some off but that didn't work. 
My mom had a beef and cheddar and hers just dripped (more than usual) everywhere! The guy putting the sauce on sandwiches needs to lay off the squeeze bottles a tad! 

If you're on a lunch break and are planning on eating your sandwich in the car, make sure you bring a spare shirt, because you'll need it!"}
{"text":"I've secretly made it a personal policy to not comment or even check in to fast food places. But my experience warrants a change of heart. At least this one time. I was actually greeted upon entering the store. The man behind the counter is a great find for this store or anywhere. He is personable, polite,  informative, patient, friendly and so on....he called me sir. 

I ordered and turned to fill my drink cup while waiting on food. I was again greeted by another staff member. 

I sat down and watched others come in. Each were greeted and treated with the same respect. I think customers should be more aware of these kinds of greetings and respond in kind. I think perhaps customers are so shocked to be greeted they lose their ability to even know what to do..

I ordered the chicken cordon blue. I was so impressed with this item. 

As I'm sitting here,  the store is getting busier. The man is on top of it. Same consistent professionalism. But I would argue the case that in this case, the man is just being himself. Again. What a great find. If there is at all an argument for $15 an hour. This man should be the representative. If he's not already making it, he needs to. 

Keep it up."}
{"text":"I live right behind this Arby's and I have eaten there 20+ times.  This is the best Arby's that I have been to.  Why you ask?  They are always cleaning, the food tastes great and everyone is very nice.  I have been there right before they close and they are still really nice.  In my opinion, kindness and good customer service makes any good taste better."}
{"text":"I had a half hour lunch ordered my food and the disorganization at the location lost my order and i had to ask for it after waiting for 15 min, finally got it and had to scarf down the sloppy mess they put together so i could make it back to work but was still late"}
{"text":"I came to this Arby's yesterday for a quick sandwich around 4:30pm - not only did we wait for ever in a line that only had a car in front of us, but we have never received such awful customer service.  Food was great, but I would not return due to my previous customer experience."}
{"text":"So with this being an Arby's I'll make this review short and sweet. The food has always been good from this business and this is not the first time I have been to Arby's. Love the curly fries and mid roast beef sandwich. Can't leave out the potato cakes also. In addition, they recently added Gyros to their menu and they are actually not too bad considering their from Arby's.

The only issue that I have is with the pricing. I think that the prices at Arby's are steep but of course I think all prices are steep. Just find yourself some 2 for 1 coupons and when you do decide to come here you won't feel like you broke the bank for a couple of meals."}
{"text":"We have always had a decent meal at this location. Staff are pleasant, fast and outgoing. The restaurant could use some a remodel."}
{"text":"You started off so well....
I thought we could start a relationship out of this, but I guess not.
Web ordering my marketplace turkey sandwich, I clearly asked for no tomatoes. The girl behind the intercom even repeated this back to me. But of course what happens? I get my sandwich and on it are three red tomatoes slices.
I know I sound like a brat. I simply took the tomatoes off, but its the principle and quite simple to follow."}
{"text":"Came on to dine on 5/25/16 about 1:30 PM.
Service was average, assisted by the Store Manger. 
Wanted to try the new Bourbon Brisket sandwich. Have to say, kinda disappointed. The sauce- I would have expected to be a dark bourbon glaze or some type of Bourbon BBQ sauce? It was more a yellow mustard sweet sauce (very sweet). Sandwich presentation was a little messy & not much meat or sauce for the price of $7.99 as a combo meal.
Won't say I was very impressed with the meal or experience. It's been sometime since I've dined at Arby's & don't think I'll be back anytime soon in the near future."}
{"text":"Went back..big mistake! Curly fries burnt, chicken burnt, and honey mustard on a Cordon Bleu sandwich that is supposed to have mayo. HORRIBLE DINNER! And of course no one will answer the phone to complain too."}
{"text":"I just ordered a salad and it had at least three things wrong. I asked for no tomatoes and it was covered in them. I received the wrong dressing and was missing my sauce. The salad was also supposed to have bacon but that was missing too (and had little cheese).I ended up with almost $9 for a bowl of lettuce and a small soda. I won't be back.."}
{"text":"I just got the bacon and swiss chicken sandwich and I ended up getting a free drink. :) It's been a long time since I've been to an Arby's, so I noticed that their prices jumped a bit. The drive thru employee was friendly but the wait took forever for just a sandwhich, especially since there was only one car in front of me. I'll probably just dine in next time."}
{"text":"I love this place.  There used to be this old Dude who sweeped the street with his broom. He used to talk to himself so one day I saw him in Arby's and I asked him who he was talking to and he yelled at me so loud in front of everyone in Arby's.  He even said the F Word to me.  

In regards to Arby's food.  I love the curly fries and the chicken sandwich is the best of all of the fast food restaurants.  It is even better than Burger King."}
{"text":"Arby's!  Always good when you're craving some beef!  No gripes but no props really.  Just writing a review for posterity's sake.  Came here for a bite when we were moving into the new nicer place.  

One thing that is awesome sauce is, well, their horseradish sauce. Always keep it, never discontinue it pls tks

dmo out"}
{"text":"The last two times I have been here, I used the drive thru.  And both of those times, it took 15-20 minutes to get my order.  

Each time after arriving home, each order was wrong.  I called to talk to the manager each time and explained what was wrong with each order.  The manager put my name on a \"list\" to get another meal on them. 

If you have to keep up with a \"list\", there's a problem. 

I have redeemed one of the meals. I am on the \"list\" again for another.   After this meal I will no longer go back to this location.  Seriously tired of my order always being wrong.  

And no I shouldn't have to check to see if it's right before I leave.  

Get it together employees!

Update 2/9/2017
Went today to redeem my food from the \"list\".  The cashier knew about a list but could not find it.  She then went and got a manager.  He acted like he didn't believe me.  I did get my correct order this time.   It was hot and good.  This will be the last time I come here!"}
{"text":"Oh how I as sooo excited about Arby's! But it was only short lived sadly.

Needing lunch I saw this location. Man oh man did I get excited! You see here in Vermont we don't have an Arby's. So for me this is a cheap small treat! So I thought to my self...How bad can this really be? I came to become surprised by the end of my time at this location.

As we walked in it wasn't the cleanest place but I'm willing to over look that. Its fast food! I know what to expect. 

As we walked up to the counter a female worker was taking our order. The manager then came up and ordered her to take something outside while she was taking our order. So he took over the order as she was about to hit the total button and close the order out for us. But instead she walks away as shes told and he looks at us and goes \"What else can I get you?\" So I looked at him sorta funny. From there I told him she was about to finish out order and he just nodded toward us. As I gave him the money to pay for our order he pulls out his personal cell phone and makes a call while giving me my change. Having a full on conversation with one of his friends. Now I don't have a high expectation of fast food joints and I tent to stay away from them but this was to much.

As we are waiting for our food I notice 2-3 other orders that came in after us got tossed out before ours. Again not good. When I was hanging around waiting for our order he looked at me like I was annoying him. At this point I had said nothing. About 10 minutes later we got our order. I went to sit down and my girlfriend leaned over to talk to me and said \"They are rude.\" Even before I said anything else. So it wasn't just me. 

The food seemed ok. We spent around $18.00 or so. However this location still needs a lot of work. Rude people and long wait times at a fast food joint is just bad. Stay clear of this location and go over to another town. It would be worth it."}
{"text":"Bad staff. Broken soda spigot came out, sprayed me all over with soda and all they said was \"Found the broken spigot!\" No manager came out to say sorry or anything. Just left me to leave with a soaked shirt in the middle of winter.
I know it's fast food, but something like that should still be taken care of properly."}
{"text":"They do NOT give sauce, double check your bag! Asked for a handful, got 1 per sandwich! Dorkwipes."}
{"text":"They don't wear gloves, they have food (LIKE CHICKEN) sitting in the warmer for LITERALLY 2 WHOLE HOURS and if someone finally orders it, instead of making a new, FRESH one they take the old, soggy food and RE DROP it in the fryers. 
One fryer even caught on fire and instead of closing or getting it fixed they just used the other ones for WEEKS. 
Homeless people come in and out. People constantly come in and used drugs in the bathroom. 
If you're getting your food in a timely manner, that means you are getting old food 90% of the time. 
Stay clear of Arby's in general, but if you can't DO NOT come to this particular location."}
{"text":"They removed the The Roast Turkey and Swiss Market Fresh from their menu. (The one on the square bread)

I had to get a turkey sandwich on a disgusting bun. 

Really bad lunch today"}
{"text":"Food was fine. Usual Arby's quality. Great customer service and very clean seating and dining areas."}
{"text":"What a joke! This is what I openned up to!! Nasty... Supose to be their new gyro bowl over curly fries...this is the worst defraud pic to actual product I've ever seen. Shame on you Arbys"}
{"text":"Best Arby's ever. I'm sure this is a bit of an exception, however... a great experience nonetheless. 

I passed through Medina on my way home to Cleveland from Columbus after several days of military training so I was in uniform. When the kid at the window saw my uniform, he took my card, rang me up with a military discount (which was sizeable relative to many other places offering similar discounts), queued up a fresh batch of fries, and thanked me for my service. I never know how to respond to the \"thank you for your service\" thing, but I greatly appreciated the extra kindness. Bravo."}
{"text":"Went to arbys to get a beef and cheddar. They said they ran out. A place known for several roast beef sandwiches had no roast beef and would not say if they had more or were to make more. Also no apology nor a discount for losing half their menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting food au ju tastes like mop water and sour taste on my beef and cheddar took one bite and spit it out. waste of $15 the mozzarella sticks were ok. I loved arby's growing up however this was my very last visit staff was nice so they can have the automatic 1 star."}
{"text":"I was inside waiting for my order tonight and I could tell it was a little busy. There was a young girl named Savannah who was very kind working the register taking and then there was an older woman running around yelling behind her. She was frantic and was banging on tables as cars went through the drive thru. She was very unprofessional. I hadn't ever seen anything like that. She wasn't even ashamed of the way she was behaving in front of customers. I asked Savannah who the woman was she said it was her manager! That is absolutely ridiculous that a manager would behave that way! Even though her manager was doing that, she remained calm and professional. I feel sorry for her."}
{"text":"Great service with a smile! open early and awesome from sandwhiches!"}
{"text":"Hello friends,

This is the first time I've been to this location. Located near O'Charles. I'm on a milkshake kick. They have a milkshake that name slips my mind at the time. But......it was good.

Very clean and nice service. I love there curly fries."}
{"text":"Worst Arby's I've ever been to. It took 25 minutes to get our food and the staff just seemed to not have it together. We just moved to the area and will be skipping over this as an option for fast food from now on."}
{"text":"Yeah, I get lazy sometimes and normally don't like fastfood, but Arby's is alright.  I'm a fan for a few reasons:

*I love their Market Fresh sandwiches, specially their chicken pecan salad. I can't do the big greasy burgers at night before bed. 
*I like Arby-Q's and roast beef. 
*I LOVE curly fries!  
*Surprisingly they have a decent cherry turnover and flavored teas.
*They have shakes, and have a small, kid cup size, option which is a plus since I can't drink more than half a average sized shake. 
*And they're right by the house and open late (til 12 or 1)."}
{"text":"This was the MOST MISERABLE EXPERIENCE AT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT EVER!!! It literally took them 15 minutes just to take our order!! They kept repeating it back wrong, completely adding in things that we never even mentioned!!! Then they were missing some our food when we received our bags. They also never gave us the dip for my French DIP & Swiss sandwich!!!! Do not go here, unless you enjoy terrible service & not receiving the food you paid for!!"}
{"text":"Drove up to to drive thru where there was a mix-up of orders and I received the wrong order. I lived out of town and a woman named Diamond assured me that if I came by the following day during her shift she would take care of me. I went there the following evening and she reimbursed me and cooked up a fresh order if what I wanted the previous night. The food was fresh and good, as well as the service. She was the example of exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"This has got to be the friendliest Arby's I have ever seen. It's got that nice, small hometown customer service style to it. Like most Arby's, coupons can be reused infinitely which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"This guys were super friendly. We always have horrible expreiances at fast food joint but everyone was so nice and polite. Great great great service. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"I came here for their 2 for $6 special and was surprised at the happy hour from 2pm to 5pm which gives you any slider for $1 and a small shake for $1 and that's worth it to me because their shakes are delicious  now, the reason for the 3 stars instead of four is because the drive thru guy was rushing me and I don't really like that (especially since there was no one behind me) it had been a while since I was here last and may be a little while again because my son & I are trying to eat healthier"}
{"text":"Generally I love Arby's. Yes I know it is not fine dining, so I'm not delusional in that regard. I worked as a manager of Arby's for four years, and I still eat there.

I love the French dip, but the brisket is awesome. I bet straight out of the smoker it is even better, but unfortunately pre-slice it and microwave it to heat it. It's still pretty damned good. 

I've eaten at this location many times as it is close to work, and it's good, but on Tuesday September 6th it was terrible. We arrived during lunch rush and there were about 10 people in line ahead of us. The cashier was taking orders quickly, but they weren't being filled fast enough to keep up. There was a large group of people waiting to get their food that had already ordered.

My friend ordered the chicken sandwich and I had the brisket combo. We waited patiently as people slowly received their food. We were next. But then they served the people who came after us. And another. And another. And another. We went to the counter to inquire and the sandwich maker said he hadn't seen our order, even though it was clearly on the screen, being passed up. The manager said \"I need that brisket, they've been waiting  for 10 minutes.\" Yes, 10 minutes to get a simple meal from a fast food location. And when they finally served us all I received was a lame, insincere \"sorry for your wait.\" 

Very poor customer service and it ate up 1/3rd of our lunch break. Sad."}
{"text":"Today is the last day I will EVER visit Arbys.  Plastic inside my sandwich.  

Chicken was burnt.  Sandwich looks like it was thrown across the room.

I still have no idea what that black thing is inside my sandwich.

Horrible!  I feel like I've been poisoned.  What is this horrible chicken sandwich?

I went back to get a refund and there's a bum washing his sweat rag in the soda fountain. Nasty nasty nasty management you better figure it out quickly because this place is going down"}
{"text":"Normal place but service was lacking.  3 people in front serving the drive up so I stood there for several minutes.  Finally the one server turned around and all was fine then.  Just had a normal Arby's style hamburger.

But having the manager and a couple of staff members smoking directly outside of the west facing door was disturbing.  They just don't get the fact that this ruins the service and rating of an establishment for many people.

Plenty of fast food places."}
{"text":"One of the worst place ever!!! Do not go trough the drive trough about a 10 min wait and then you get your good cold!!! Everyone there is roude! Been there a few times always the same issues , last time they have my buisness!!"}
{"text":"I I rarely come here. A couple times it was decent. This last time the customer service was atrocious I will never be back.

 Thanks Julio."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a friend. No line in the drive threw and it took 17 minutes for 2 sandwiches and a order of fries."}
{"text":"Food is great. Normal Arby's. Drive thru is a NIGHTMARE. Takes like 10-15 mins, but you can walk right in and get it to go in less than 5 mins. Makes no sense. Follow others advise, go in, and skip the D/T."}
{"text":"This Arby's was on-point tonight.  I had a large to-go order.  They were friendly, attentive, and quick.  Arby's food is Arby's food, but service-wise they slay the local Wendy's or McDonald's locations."}
{"text":"Good service through the drive thru. Quick and pleasant.  There was not a huge line on a weekday lunchtime.  My sandwich was hot and fresh and made just how I asked for it.  I got plenty of the sauce I asked for.  Good customer service.  I had a positive experience."}
{"text":"The food here is always fresh and tastes good, which is saying a lot for fast food...which, I rarely eat.  Mostly because it's usually gross, but also because customer service is non existent anymore in the fast food world. I have a few of my favorite from when I was young that I get a taste for every once in awhile, Arby's is one of them. 

Quick drive through, friendly people, never any issues."}
{"text":"A quick place to grab lunch on the go!  Obviously not the healthiest, but we all know that. The store is clean and neat.  The manager took my order and was very friendly.  The food came out quickly and everything tasted good and was hot & fresh. 

No issues with this store, I would come back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Went to this Arbys a few days ago because I was craving the Ultimate Angus (Three Cheese and Bacon) sandwich. The advertised picture of this sandwich looks amazing. Well to my surprise, once I received my sandwich, it looked like a totally different item. The bread was even different. It was horrible. I know food doesnt always look as advertised but this was not even close."}
{"text":"My friend and I just experienced the absolute best customer service we've ever experienced at ANY restaurant-let alone a fast food restaurant! The lady who helped us was Faye. She came to our table and asked if we needed anything and even took our trash away. She was pleasant and made our meal enjoyable. Quite honestly, we were shocked to receive such excellent customer service. Thank you, Faye!!"}
{"text":"I stop by a lot when I need a quick meal. They never get my order wrong, or it never takes very long to get food here. It's always quiet and clean inside the dining area."}
{"text":"This is actually a super classy  Arby's. Not joking. Very clean, really pleasant inside, and friendly service. Rock on, Arby's of champaign!"}
{"text":"Arby's blinds all of its fast food competition by placing ten gallon hats over the faces of The Clown, The Monarch, The Colonel, The Chihuahua, and The Redhead. Watching them stumble about and into each other, The Cowboy chuckles all the while as he contemplates his future with a toothpick between his lips and a bullrope in his hand. 

It sort of hurts to say this, but I doubt I've ever had a made-to-order roast beef sandwich as moist, filling, and flavorful as what Arby's does up. I like how the bun is crisped in a track toaster, how the slicer never seems to stop cutting paper-thin roast beef, and how I can get lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, and cheddar on my sandwich without getting cross-eyed looks from any of the employees. 

Although, I must own up to the fact that I still pine for the day when the onion petals and the rest of the Market Fresh sandwiches return to their impressive and extensive menu.

And Arby's new Chocolate Lava Cake ain't bad for what it is. 

Neither are the jamocha shakes and their turnovers. 

Bless the Brothers Raffel for their fabulous franchise and for helping hungry children by teaming up with the Share Our Strength and No Kid Hungry campaigns.

Luckily, we now have one minutes from us on Banksville Road. I'm forming the mallochio with my fingers in the hopes that Arby's survives."}
{"text":"I'm thinking...four stars. See my other Arby's review. 

Arby's with their wide selection and superior offerings makes them the kings of the lowest end of the culinary scene. Everything they have on their wide menu shoots anything from Burger King or McDonald's or Wendy's with a buttful of buckshot in a \"git off mah propertay\" manner. 

Replace the ten gallon hat with a crown. 

Yeah, I know fast food is supposed to be the devil, but someone has to review these places. lol. Arby's truly ain't bad if you're short on coin, and lots of us are these days, except in the alternate dimension of Yelp, where everyone but me seems to make $50K a year minimum.  Trapped in a world I never made?

I kid the yuppies. 

But I won't kid Arby's They're pretty swell for what they do. No lies."}
{"text":"This Arby's is gone. I wonder if the one in Castle Shannon took all its business. Its lack of drive-thru may have been a factor as well."}
{"text":"Stopped late at night, made fresh frys and they didn't seem to mind us being there close to closing."}
{"text":"The cashier at window was very rude and the meat was heated up in a microwave. When I returned the food the manager acted as if I was the problem because they were serving terrible food and horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Service was good great, but the decor is very outdated.  Smells musty in there.  Would not want to eat in here next time I am this way."}
{"text":"Dining room was disgusting, with 3 employees stepping over food and trash, but not taking the time to clean it up (typical \"text happy generation\" employees!  If I were the owner I would clean up their acts... Literally! 
Had we not been soooo hungry, we would have left. Please Clean the high chairs!!!, they were so filthy and sticky I couldn't let my child sit in it... therefore she couldn't be \"contained\" and was running all around, climbing under the table and sitting on the nasty floor, thanks for a ruined meal!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Very good fish sandwiches.  The lobby is clean.  The potatoes cakes are good but pretty greasy.  The ambiance is nice and the radio  (I assume) was not too loud.  I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Great food great service and fun to have our own room so to speakAngel and Kenny were especially nice. There were 7 of us and everybody went away full and happy!! One request is please bring back the arby-q."}
{"text":"My fav fast food place and location. Food is fresh, hot and can be healthy. I would give it 5 stars except for the night manager--terrible! The day manager and entire day crew are pleasant, courteous and on top of things. The food is consistently good and hot. Place is clean. Accomidating my desire for no bun snd will put any sandwich on a wrap. Day manaagers even walk around to see if all ok. Last Thurs, the night manager was actually nasty and rude...even when she took the order, acting as if she never heard of water as the drink or ham/swiss as a wrap (not what i got).She screwed up the order-gave curly fries not onion rings-tgen kept saying we didn't order rings. Three times she as much as called my cousin a liar. Between denials, she said \"$2.07 for the rings and you can have them, or just eat the fries\" The Reubens were not hot, nor was the beef & cheddar. But it was her attitude. She claimed she was the manager. She should not even be working there! Her name is Carol Flynn. So go during the day, but not after 9 pm."}
{"text":"We been eating at this establishment for a long time.  There was a time when I would have given a rating of 1 or less, due to its condition and management, but I am giving it a 4+ today.  I cannot vouch for eating in since most our food has been drive-through.  I made an error today and when I took it back to place an order for the correct sandwich I was given a new sandwich without additional cost.  The management there is completely customer focused and really does listen to complaints."}
{"text":"Took forever. Went through the drive through and ended up turning off my car after waiting for 7 minutes for one person ahead of me to get their food. Then waited another 9 minutes to get mine....horrible service. Ok food."}
{"text":"I stopped by here to eat around 6:15 PM this evening (Tuesday).  No customers inside, but more surprisingly, no employees inside either.  I stood at the cash register for several minutes and could not see a single employee anywhere in the restaurant.  I even called out, but no answer.  I left without eating.  It seems to be a very poorly-run place."}
{"text":"It has been years since I went to Arby's, but went this weekend because my hubby and I were starving and we had coupons. I had a beef and cheddar sandwich, loaded curly fries and a triple chocolate cookie. The sandwich was cold, didn't have much cheddar cheese and wasn't very good. The fries were okay a bit better with decent taste. They had a good amount of cheese, bacon and ranch. The cookie was very chocolately, almost like there was too much chocolate. Each bite had more chocolate than actual cookie. My hubby liked it, but I didn't love it and I am a sweets/chocolate person."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Arby's!! But this location is horrible! Their food does not taste fresh.. Tastes like its been sitting out for hours.. They were completely out of napkins andtold us we could use paper towels from the bathroom.. The yogurt they gave my toddler with his meal had expired a week prior. Their service is horrible. Had to wait at register for several minutes and actually call out for someone before we received assistance. Would not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped after lunch time about five days ago on our way to Kentucky.
Not busy. Tried twice to get the correct sandwich. Evidently not possible. Gave up and asked for my money back after the old woman at the counter argued with me about THEIR mistakes. Leaving with my semi good lemonade and a hungry tummy"}
{"text":"Waited 5 minutes at speaker to be told one second 3 times.no one inside but 2 people and only one car in front.Dont waste your time!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here after 9:00pm and the dining room was closed. We did the drive they and they were super slow serving us. However, the food was good and hot. We had the Chicken sandwich and buffalo slider and they were cook d perfectly."}
{"text":"It's your basic Arby's.  Nice location right off the interstate - easy to hit.  We found it to be clean, friendly, and fast."}
{"text":"Went to this store last night for the 2 for $6 Bacon, Beef and Cheddar.  But was told that \"We are stop that special.\"  Ok, Just brought the special for lunch that same day. Plus the special was still on the sign outside.  :(
Drove to South Blvd. Store....And was told the special just started!  WOW...........I guess staff did not want to work. BAD night STAFF!!! BAD customer service!!!"}
{"text":"The girl was professional and virtuous however the two guys on shift one of them followed us in from a smoke break right outside of the entrance and did not wash his hands and continued making food . I do not recommend coming here at night when the younger kids are working"}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to stop after work and pick up some Arby's for dinner. Apparently it was a HUGE bother to Kenny that works there because we were treated awful!! This guy looks like he hates his job and hates life!! We walked in and stood at the counter for a while and was never acknowledged by anyone including Kenny who walked by us a couple of times. When he did come to take our order we were greeted by \"what did you need\"!! He would not make eye contact with me and was down right RUDE!! He treated every single customer like they were a bother to him! I hope for his sake he finds a job that he is happy at and can start living life cause he is going to ruin this business! I will never return here again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I usually love Arby's,but I will never be returning to this Arby's. every single time I have been to this location there has been something Wrong with my order! The first time, we got breakfast and my biscuits were very under cooked it was just dough covered in gravy. The second time, we got something completely different then what we ordered. The third time, I found a blond hair in my food! My hair is black! Every time I tried to take my food back to show them they completely disregard me and treat me like I'm lying and in the hair situation they walked a few feet away and said \"it's probably her hair anyway!\" Like I said my hair is black!"}
{"text":"As fast food goes this is a pretty good option. Love the original roast beef sandwich with Arby's sauce!!!"}
{"text":"My husband went to the restroom after we finished eating. A male employee came out of the bathroom stall and left the restroom WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS!!!! We all know fast food joints can be iffy, but GROSS!!!!! Guy wiped, did not wash his hands, and went straight back into the kitchen! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! NASTY!!!!!"}
{"text":"Slllllllooooooowest Arby's ever
And all Arby's are just too expensive
Great Jamocha shakes though!"}
{"text":"If there was a zero star I'd give them zero. Long line with plenty of workers. Cashier yelling back to the people making the food. Manager person walking around talking to the help doing nothing. Says something to cashier and she shouted \"what do you want me to do?\"  No co2 in soda machine. No sauce. People standing around waiting for food and one person having to come up two times to get order fixed. Wow. Worst service. Stay away."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good I can't complain I only come here when I have a craving for it. This only happens maybe once every three years or so. The facilities were clean the service was good and my sandwich was actually pretty tasty. However I had a sore stomach later LOL."}
{"text":"Had the new chipotle chicken sandwich.  Nothing to write home about, but got the job done satisfying my hunger.  The place has some tvs to watch and overall its pretty clean."}
{"text":"Oh Arby's... we knew we were in for an experience when we saw a guy up at the counter getting his money back. He had come inside from the drive thru. Must be a new crew. I ordered the Chicken Bacon Swiss meal with no lettuce, tomato, or honey mustard. My boyfriend ordered the same combo, as is. Everything was correct on our receipt. When we got our food, my sandwich was plain like I wanted, but too plain. They forgot the bacon! My boyfriend's sandwich had honey mustard, but was missing lettuce, tomato, and bacon! They said they would remake our sandwiches. When we got our new sandwiches, my boyfriend's was correct, but mine had honey mustard! AH! They had to make me a 3rd sandwich. Unbelievable. How many wrong ways can you make a sandwich, Arby's?! At least the curly fries were good."}
{"text":"I know rating an arbys is not a great service, but I just wanted to point out a few things...

When I arrived, the place was in tip top shape! I mean, everything was clean, in order, etc. Reasoning for this, no one was there!

When I ordered, they gave me the wrong fries and the sandwihch was a total mess (see photo attached). And for what I ordered, the price was NOT worth the level of food. The following day I went to a Wendys and spent the same amount on about double the amount of food.

I love Arby's, but not for those prices..."}
{"text":"First time at this one and I get my cup and go fill up my drink only to find an ant in my drink. Restaurant looked fairly clean and all but I just can't stand finding stuff in my drinks or food but the food was fresh and out in a reasonable time."}
{"text":"We've had it with this arbys,  total disregard for customers serving crap disguised as food"}
{"text":"Can I give this place the finger?

A 5 minute wait at the drive thru at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon, followed by not asking if I want any sauces followed by incorrect change given back to me. 

How hard is it to slice roast beef & do math?"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this Arby's for years, yet I have never written a review.  Well, it's about time. I love their hot Italian subs. They are delicious.  Today, I tried the buffalo chicken sandwich, but it was disappointing. The sandwich fell apart while I was eating it. It just didn't hold together well. The bread was a little tough (almost like a pretzel) and there was way to much buffalo sauce.

I think I'll stick with what works next time."}
{"text":"This Arby's does it right. The food was hot and fresh. We had a large group dining in and they had our food ready in just a couple minutes. I had a Nashville fish sandwich, which was a bit spicy and pretty tasty. I love the potato cakes too!

Good food. Good service. I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Stopped by Arby's during a recent volleyball tournament. This store is new looking, clean, and nicely appointed. The service was a little slow, but the food was spot on.

I had an Italian sub, which was delicious, filling, and satisfying. The curly fries were yummy. Free drink refills and a good selection of sodas and teas were offered, which was nice. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"I've visited this Arby's twice recently and both trips have been very good. I ordered an Italian sub with onion rings today and my food was ready in a reasonable amount of time and the worker was friendly and efficient. I definitely noticed that Arby's food quality and service are better than other fast food restaurants. Their prices are higher too, but like Tupac said, \"That's just the way it is.\"

On my two recent trips, I noticed one other thing - Arby's has some damn good onion rings. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that amongs the fast food giants, Arby's has the best onion rings, by far. They're large, perfectly fried, and delicious. The batter is crunchy and you can bite through the onion without pulling all of the onion out of the ring. Score!

Love the onion rings!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a bite at Arby's with a co-worker before our class this evening.  We were in a hurry, so we needed something quick and tasty.  Despite Arby's annoying, 'Good Mood Food' ad campaign, the food was actually pretty good.

I tried the new Angus Roast Beef Sub, which was pretty good.  It had melted cheese, sauteed green peppers and onions, and some yummy sauce on it.  It was big and filling.  I love the potato cakes and horse radish sauce.

The service was quick and we were the only ones in the place at dinner time.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"Mike, the manager of this location, is great.  He really cares about the quality of his operation and the service delivered.

Yes, it is still fast food.  But the little things really make a difference when comparing mass-produced food experiences like fast food, and, on that score, this particular Arby's is a winner.  Clean as a whistle and you get treated like a human being and not just a number. 

Expect to be greeted warmly and to get your food promptly.   Mike makes a real difference because he takes his job seriously and trains his staff accordingly. Ring the bell on the way out if you enjoyed your experience - and get a chorus of Thank Yous! from the staff for your trouble.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love their orange shake!! Mix it with chocolate and you'll thank me later!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I used to work at an Arby's years ago so it is always fun to visit them and see if the food/staff is up to standards. We went through the drive through and ordered a Beef n Cheddar Combo and an additional sandwich on the side. The girl who took our order was very friendly and took the order quickly. The food was tasty and I am happy to report that the fries were hot and hadn't been sitting out. We were cashed out and handed our food, the drinks were almost forgotten and we had to remind them. It didn't bother me at all but they might want to work on handing the drinks out promtly after cashing out the order to quench the customers thirst in the Arizona heat and to improve their overall drive through times. I thought this location was very unique also because they have the old school Arby's hat sign outside of their store which is rare to see."}
{"text":"Had the roast beef max. it was plenty filling. Son had the chicken he said it was good but not great service was fast and friendly restaurant was very clean. Would return again. 20.00 bucks for lunch"}
{"text":"I LOVE Arby's, especially this location. Not only is is less than a 2 minute drive from my house, but the service is always helpful and super friendly, inside is always clean, and my food is perfect each time. With the coupons I get in the mail I've been trying different things and I am shocked how good they are, such as the Italian sub and the grand turkey club... nice job Arby's I'm impressed. :) I've been to this location multiple times and will continue to come back!! Yumm"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. My friend has an allergy to the ingredients in mayo, so naturally she ordered food without mayo. Infact all the sandwiches were ordered without mayo (just in case). And of course upon inspection, there was mayo. An unusual amount just globbed  onto my friends sandwich and mayo residue (like someone scraped it off after putting it on) on the other sandwich. Went in to express our discontent, the cashier was very empathetic and polite. She handed the sandwich to the female cook and explained the situation. The female cook turned to the male cook and told him to make another one saying \"no mayo SHE COMPLAINED\" then turned back to give my friend a nasty look. Not only is this behavior incredibly rude, the attitude was uncalled for. Had she simply made the sandwich correctly in the first place our return inside wouldn't have been necessary. And I hope this gets around fast enough to provide insight into the poor staffing this facility has- well how poorly they staffed this particular person. RUDE."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Arby's restaurant since 2003, really nice updated menu. Clean and friendly store."}
{"text":"I've been sitting in this drive through for nearly 15 minutes. They at first got my order incorrect and then whoever (a woman) took my order gave my friend and I attitude when I politely asked her to repeat the order to ensure accuracy. I can definitely say I will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Drove through to pick up a late lunch . . . ordered the 2 for $5 fish sandwiches, one \"Nashville\" hot and one regular.They were great! A thick, juicy, mild triangle of crunchy-coated fish overhanging a  soft bun. Plenty of shredded lettuce and tarter sauce. I was amazed at how big and fresh and satisfying they were!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Arby's in a decade. Someone mentioned it has quite improved and I wanted to try it out. I have to say that I was quite impressed with their beef brisket! Check out their website and you will see via video that they use ACTUAL smoked in Texas meat, not processed crap. It is very good quality for a fast food place. 

We also ordered a Reuben and it was also good for a fast food restaurant. The quality of their food has quite improved!!

The reason they get only three stars is that I think it is a bit expensive for a fast food place. Hubby and I ate a brisket sandwich (meal deal with small fries and a small drink), a Reuben and I drank water and the bill was over $15.00!"}
{"text":"Yes I wanted the Cuban. May because I making black bean soup for dinner. They promised a lot and they gave me nothing. No pickle, no mustard, the cheese with congealed, there was a piece of ham and something else that I could not recognize. I had gone through the drive-in was home and had to drive back because I was so incensed.

The manager asked me what I wanted him to do. I asked him to make the sandwich the way the picture left. He then tried to tell me well you know they take those pictures of the food looks good. Are you kidding me? 

I would eat here again only if it's the last place to eat on earth"}
{"text":"If your like me, you love slow roasted roast Beef sandwiches and the thought of them makes your mouth water!  You probably enjoy great customer service and any location that provides it, will earn and enjoy your continued patronage!

If the above is true for you, 
DON'T BOTHER COMING TO THIS LOCATION.

I've visited this location 3 times in the last 3 months.  I always order the same thing at Arby's, so it's easy to make comparisons from location to location. 

1st visit, Drive-Thru
Ordered the Large Roast Beef Max combo, which is the one that's so big you can barely get your mouth around it.  Upon getting home, 13 minutes drive, I find that they left off the top of my bun and half of the meat?  What!?  How do you leave off the top of the bun and half the meat unless you did it on purpose?  The large fries were only half way full (none were in the bag) and there was no straw, no napkins and the ketchup i asked for didn't make it into the bag. 

2nd visit, inside 
Took a friend to Arby's for lunch, I told him about my previously bad experience and we laughed about how uncommon that is for Arby's.  I ordered the same as above, and my friend ordered some variety of chicken sandwich with bacon on it. We sat and enjoyed talking, and realized it had been 20 minutes and our food wasn't ready, upon approaching the counter they offered a free cookie and said it would be right out.  It was out about 5 minutes later, making you think that the food was just started when they gave me the cookie.  Upon getting the order it was completely the wrong sandwich for my friend.  Our fries tasted cold and overdone, as if they'd sat on a tray since the moment we Ordered.  Finally got it right with fresh fries, 42 minutes after we initially ordered.

3rd visit, Drive-Thru
My wife picked up Arby's on the way home, and upon arrival, found that both of our roast beef sandwiches were very undercooked.  I drove back to the location and asked for a refund, remembering the past two visits, I was done.  The manager was quick to get me a refund, and offered to take care of our meal.  However; she told me that the reddish meat is the way their suppose to make the sandwich.  I told her that if that's the case, then no other Arby's has ever made it correctly and she must be the only one (flippant I know) but she did say she hoped we'd come back.  I told her that after 3 bad experiences I wouldn't be back. 

The 4 for 4 I picked up at Wendy's was cheaper and delicious though!  I'll be glad when the new location opens in Harrisburg so I have another Arby's location to patron."}
{"text":"Went not expecting much as I have been to Arby's numerous times.  I went through the drive thru this time where I was greeted kindly, but the service was pretty slow.  The food was exactly what I expected, and my appetite was satisfied.  Recommend if you're looking for something other than your typical burger and fries."}
{"text":"Had the Brisket sandwich, and it was fantastic.  Curly fries were hot and fresh.  I was a little nervous trying this location since I drive by regularly and rarely see anybody there.  I was very pleased, and I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is the worst ever, the guy on the drive thru is very rude and yells all the time we had to repeat the order 3 different times and then he said I don't understand your order, we were frustrated as we waited 20 minutes to get out of the line as we decided not to order  we had to be stuck on the line 20 minutes as there is no way out. Whole we were waiting people were returning food back at the window and people behind us were arguing with the guy taking the orders, so In Total 5 cars did not leave with food terrible terrible service and for the record the order was plain and simple 2 traditional gyro and a 6 pc mozzarella sticks. I'm from out of town will not be returning here ever again as I live in the area, they need new management and better customer service and then the company wonder why they are loosing money."}
{"text":"Ate here once at 1:30 on a Wednesday and we were the only ones there. But the service was really friendly and fast, and the food tasted great. Building was also very clean."}
{"text":"As soon as I pulled up to the drive thru I realized that I should've just gotten fast food. Every time I come to this Arby's it takes me at least 15 mins to get my food; It doesn't matter if I go inside or go through the drive thru. Sheesh, they move like molasses here. 

They ALWAYS have cold fries. But what else can you expect after spending 15 mins waiting for your food?

Why do I return you ask? Because I just can't stay away from the MEATS! And those fries...they're just so...curly."}
{"text":"Great food only thing is that we all know arbys is expensive for fast food. I purchased roast beef sandwiches requested tomato and lettuce they charge extra for it. That sucked rude manager here at this location as well."}
{"text":"typical arbys location, food was good and the drive thru line went fast. It is an older building so I do recommend upgrades to the display board and speakers."}
{"text":"One star for the new renovation, the building looks really nice and updated now. 

Another star for their mozzarella sticks. For real, I don't know why and some people think I'm crazy, but Arby's mozz sticks are the best ever. I'm always let down by other restaurants. Who knew??

Beyond that, it's an Arby's. Standard fare, standard service."}
{"text":"Love the seasonal chicken salad sandwich, the bread is soft and very fresh, the mayo dressing on the salad has a little twang to it, the apples and walnuts are fresh and crisp, but fries always stale.  

I got the combo, sandwich, curly fries and drink and it was $9, I thought that was a bit high, considering the fries were so bad, I threw them out!  Love the sandwich, would rather eat it with chips!"}
{"text":"I love this drive thru every time I always have the most pleasant interactions with the workers. Today Vicky was so sweet and gave me a ton of sauces. Shout out to Vicky who ever you are. You are soooo sweet and I enjoyed speaking with you."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today we live  close to this Arby's and I love there food. The food was okay however this restaurant wAs so dirty! The employees appeared to be standing around. Well anyway not sure I will go back if the dining room is filthy I can't imagine what the back looks like!"}
{"text":"Drive thru 2/6.00 french dip 4 piece potatoes 2.xx. bill was little over 8. Bucks not bad, but the meat was ice cold. I called health board too temp suppose to be over 140. It was below 40. The potatoes were heated up rotren. My brother just took it all back. Don't go there
Bad Karma!!!!! When I called Arby's tge manager said bring it back I'll reheat it. Oops I ment make you fresh ones"}
{"text":"Well ok for a quick meal.  Wanted a sample of new drink.  Told no.  Izzy waited on us."}
{"text":"The sliders at Arby's are great! Nice selection too: Buffalo chicken and ranch, Jalapeño chicken, ham, turkey, roast beef, chicken and cheese and a few more! The curly fries are great as well, but sometimes the wait is rather long to get your order. Oh the chocolate shakes are dreamy!"}
{"text":"I'm checking in at Arby's for happy hour to get my boys a snack before Sunday dinner! 
Happy hour here used to be exciting but now things have changed! 
The happy hour shakes are no longer tall with whip cream and chocolate on top but they are in these short kids sized drink cups with no goodies on top! On a good note the sliders in the many varieties and the small Curley fries are  only one dollar!"}
{"text":"Don't get tricked like I did. Ordered a \"Loaded Italian\", it came with 2 thinly sliced of ham cut into a circle as big as a piece of pepperoni, 1/2 thin, thin slice of cheese and lots of lettuce with 2 half tomato slices. That's it! Get me once shame on you. Get me twice shame on me. That's not going to happen EVER!"}
{"text":"I read the other reviews on this arbys and had a better experience than most I guess. 
I went in to order planning on telling them it was a 'to-go' order planning on sausing up my sandwich and having packets of sauce left over if needed, and then leaving. 
I stayed because the guy at the register was nice and also gave me a lot of horsey sauce. The fries were also hot and fresh. 
The dining area here is terribly outdated and felt like a grandmas house. Aside from that someone at least took the time to clean it and make it look nice. Overall its not a blad place to stop at. 

 I can definitely see why people get angry at the sauce packet policy and them being stingy with them. Luckily that didnt happen to me.

EDIT: the speakers got turned on during my visit and the quality BLOWS!!! Filled the dining room with AM quality radio. Get it together arbys."}
{"text":"Well, I don't treat myself to fast food often. Having said that I am sorely disappointed in this Arby's. The dining room is just awful. Looks like it is from the 60s with minimal upkeep. I made my order to go because of this....fact there isn't a BATHROOM indoors? What...the...fuck? Cmon, arbys, get it together!
    The restrooms are located outside the building, not readily visible or available. I lacked the interest in finding out how to gain access to them because I hate asking for a key from the cashier....and also, it's 100 degrees outside. Save that nonsense. 

Oh, here's another note too: have sauce pumps that actually work too!  I like a lot of sauce so I decided to use the pumps to add some extra to my sandwich. No, sorry. The horsey sauce is broken. This run down dump won't last much longer than the one that just closed on Rainbow Rd if they keep this nonsense up. 

I don't want to seem like I'm super negative so I will also say that the food I did indulge in was super, as it always is at any arbys I go to. The staff was also quite polite and nice to deal with."}
{"text":"The funny thing about this Arby's, as well as the neighborhood it resides in, is that everything here feels like it comes out of a time warp set firmly in the 1970's-1990's.  And this Arby's is no different.

This place looks very old-school.  Old style logo, old-style restaurant and building with seating.  I normally don't make much note of a fast food design, but this place is decidedly retro.  Whether it was intentional, or just part of the aforementioned \"time warp\" effect, who can say?

But people don't want to come to a restaurant review page for architecture.  They want to know how the food is.  And the food here is actually pretty decent.    As I kid, it was a highlight for me to get Arby's when we went out of town, and now having one so close to home is really nice, considering the old love for the place.

I've noticed that Arby's has been changing up their selections, adding some non-roast beef selections (fish sandwich, anyone?), but their sandwich fare are generally enjoyable. 

The real perk for me has always been the Beef 'N' Cheddar.  I could probably eat four of those sammiches, and the food is done well here.  Not to mention the service is consistently dependable.  The staff is conversational and friendly, my orders have remained correct, and there never has been an outstandingly long line.

If there's a downside, Arby's has grown increasingly expensive over the years.  Just because you're getting fast food does not mean that you're getting cheap food.  Fortunately, Arby's coupons hit my mailbox with some regularity, so it's not an issue.  Still, I do miss the days of \"5 for $5\".

Respectable food, decent service, and somewhat pricey.  That's the Arby's experience, alright."}
{"text":"Y'know... Perhaps Arby's doesn't need a bright flashing sign to attract people because the name has become synonymous with good atypical fast-food sandwiches.

We stopped at this Arby's after doing a literal in-and-out at in-n-out. If you're on a strict budget, knock yourself out at the 4-item only menu, but if you want something a little better for you with a bigger selection, seriously, ditch the joint and walk over to Arby's.

The customer service was great--congenial and humored my family's craziness lol. Food was just as good and consistent as other Arby's. Got my mid roast beef sandwich, crispy curly fries and unsweetened tea.

It's quiet here, no crazies, and location honestly isn't THAT bad. It's not really tucked away or anything. It's just that it blends in with the background next to In-n-out's compensatory need to be flashy and bright."}
{"text":"Holy Cow!!!! This Arby's is fantastic. The food was very fresh and was served quickly. The manager provided great customer service. I ordered a turkey on Swiss sandwich and the turkey was overflowing on the bread. Huge portions and super clean. I was waiting at the register and the floors in the kitchen are super clean. It's the little things that make a great place and country music on the radio. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This is the best Arby's in the valley. I will drive for miles if I am anywhere near the North Side of Phoenix. The Manager, Mike makes this place. He leads with kindness and I see him always helping his team. He also knows many of his customers by name. What a treat. I also love the tree in the dining room. Very cool to have a live tree indoors. As for the food, income for the turkey/Swiss sandwich. It's always fresh and delivered quickly. This location is a must stop if your in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"Drive threw service sucks..
Told me to pull up so they could make my food fresh. Sat for 20-25 minutes nobody else pulled up behind me the whole time so I pulled back to see them just hanging out.
I banged on the drive threw window and demanded my money back.  They stated that they forgot about me and would not charge me, but would give me my meal for free.
Then I sat there for another 10 minutes.
I said f this and drove off and went somewhere else and got my food fresh and fast.
Well the next day checked my account sure enough they took the Money out of my account. Called and spoke to a manager who stated I would get my money back but it would take 3-5 days, well it took 5 and it was about a $1.00 short.  The manager told me she would send me a gift card or free meal voucher and have yet to see it.  I used to frequent Arby's A Lot have not will not be back and not just this store ... All of them.
Can't wait till machine's take over so we can get rid of these uneducated pimple poppers.
What the hell and they want $15.00 an hr.
Go to school fool."}
{"text":"The three cheese Angus bacon sandwich hit the spot.  The service was fast and the store was clean."}
{"text":"The folks here are friendly, and I should know.  Ever since they've introduced that Turkey Gyro sandwich, I have gotten to know the staff pretty well.

If you have any deviations from the standard order, it's probable that your order won't be correct!  So either stick with the menu or be prepared to come inside to ask them to remake your order.

This has happened to me on two separate occasions.  Same item was being ordered in the drive through.  I came in and waited an extra ten minutes, was I compensated in anyway for my time, troubles or their mistake.  Nope, neither time.

It's seems like there is a lag in communication between the person taking the order and the good folks who fix it.

I don't go here unless I have time."}
{"text":"First... 
Three cheers for happy hour!  What a terrific way to try things on the cheap.  Every slider was just a buck, and each was meaty.   

Having said that...  
The flavor in the turkey and cheese was lacking and the turkey meat was \"gamey.\"  The bread was soft and fresh, but in this case a little toasting would've gone a long way.  Had they added a pickle, an onion or anything at all the turkey may have been bearable.  It made me nauseous as it was...  I have to admit they were both discarded.

Adventurous eater that I am, I tried the cookie butter shake.  I hated the almond flavor in there, and threw that away as well.  Sure, I hate waste.  And because I overthink nearly everything I really hated throwing food away, but with nothing costing over $2.00 an item and time being more of an issue...  I hardly felt it was worth the trip to return their deeply disappointing fare.

Having never visiting an Arby's in my entire adult life, I will admit it took a bit of arm twisting for me to go there.  I am glad I went.  Service was fast, friendly and the value was great.  Based on those facts I wish I could give them more than three stars, but 70% of my meal turned out to be inedible...  

In all fairness their two chicken sliders (buffalo and chicken with cheese) were good.  If I ever return I would get those again."}
{"text":"30 minute, or 1 hour lunches?  That is the question.  Why can't there be a 45 minute lunch?  30 minutes is too short to go grab food, eat and enjoy it and get back to work.  1 hour is too long sometimes and you sit there for the last 20 minutes of your lunch break writing Yelp reviews at work (shameless plug!)!  A 45 minute lunch would solve all these problem.  A man can dream!  Anyways............

The other day, I had a 30 minute lunch.  I decided to get in my car and drive down Bell.  It was either going to be Arbys, Carls Jr or Jack in the Box (closest places I could get to and from within my 30 minutes!).  I decided to stop at Arbys because I saw a sign that said \"2 French Dips for $6.00\".  Sounded like a good deal.  Went through the drive through, ordered exactly that, and was on my way.

I unwrapped these sandwiches and was happy with what I saw.  The bread was fresh, slightly crusty on the outside, and soft in the middle.  The sandwich had a good amount of beef on it, and the cheese was melted nicely.  The key in this whole sandwich was \"the dip\"!  They provide you with a nice sized container of au jus to dip your sandwich in.  Since the bread was pretty sturdy, it absorbed all the au jus really well.  I have to say, I was way more impressed with these sandwiches than I thought I would be!  They were very large and filling, and tasted great!  Pair that with the $6.00 price tag and it was a great value, too!  

I usually pass Arbys on my way to somewhere else.  I may need to change that and revisit their food and check out some of their other newer offerings more often!  These sandwiches were very good!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Guy at drive thru was clearly having an off day. Or maybe he was wishing he was working at In n Out or something. Beef n Cheddar looked depressed."}
{"text":"Well, this old,  dated decor needs an overhaul, but the food is good, usually served quickly and accurately, and the dining room is almost always clean. The employees are usually okay, nothing stellar. However, trying to make a left out of the parking lot is ALWAYS challenging. Make a right, zip up a side street, and turn around. Or pray for a break in traffic."}
{"text":"If I could rate 0 stars I would overwhelmed and overworked staff management obviously pinching pennies by not having enough help in an obviously busy store resulting in no service which is horrible customer service walked out without ordering and will not go back their corporation spends millions advertising a new sandwich but you can't order it whats wrong with this picture"}
{"text":"Usually love Arbys but this was a nightmare.  I honestly thought I was gonna crack my tooth on one of the fries!!! I didn't know that was even possible. My 2 year old daughter has never turned her nose up at a french fry and she didn't get past the first bite either.  These were not ur regular sit under the heat lamp for too long fries.  These were yesterday's fries scooped from a dumpster, thrown in a bag, and handed to me as if it wasn't a mockery of the time honored tradition of deep fried potatoes.  Good. Mood. Food. The sandwiches were at least (fingers crossed) from that day but definitely spent a few too many hours under the lamp.  Before I get too sanctimonious...I will acknowledge that I do love Arbys and I should throw them a good review from one of the other locations.  It will be glorious and remind me that even if the whole world has gone to hell I can still enjoy one of lifes simple pleasures. Bun. Roast Beef. Bun. Horsey and Arbys sauce as needed.  How hard is that slackers at Craig and Rancho Arbys?  Trust me, you don't want to look back on your Arbys career and wonder if u gave it everything you had!!!  Motivation speech over."}
{"text":"Used the coupon for the free roastburger at this location and the manager let my coupon slide even though I guess I didn't print coupon the right way.  She was telling me some guy walked in there earlier and tried to use 8 coupons for himself.  Was he planning on eating 8 roastburgers and 8 soft drinks in one sitting?  Crazy bastard.  

Its just a roast beef sandwich dressed up in burgers clothing.  Ketchup and roast beef don't taste that great together imo.  Bun was good though.  My wife got the bacon and cheddar and thought it was fantastic but I felt pretty unsatisfied with my All-American."}
{"text":"I rolled through today for lunch and was nervous to order my sandwich without the bun. Living a low carb lifestyle isn't easy and it's sometimes a pain to order food and be met with people who don't understand or don't care.
I was served by Arianna, who was a delight. She was friendly, confirmed the order correctly and my transaction was efficient. 
Thanks for making lunch easy AND delicious! And thanks to Arianna for her friendly smile and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"This is such a poorly run Arby's, I wish there was another location nearby my work.
The line is always excrutiatingly long. Like, 15-20 minutes in the drive thru and 10-15 in store. The floor is always sticky and the drink station is messy. They get my order wrong 70% of the time and they never confirm it back to you.
They are slow and rude.
One time, I went through line for a beverage only. Literally, just a beverage.
I got my drink, took a sip and found that it was all soda.
I went in and dumped it, refilled it and it was the same. When I went to the counter, the girl told me their soda lines weren't working right. Why wouldn't they have told the customers that upon ordering?  They were really just hoping they could sell a defective product to stupid consumers and hope nobody would say anything.
Service has been so bad here that I've contacted their corporate office and gave them another try because they sent me a coupon. It didn't matter. 

Today I tried the Chicken Farmhouse salad for something different. It was the most meager salad I've ever had from a restaurant/ fast food. White iceburg lettuce, about 1 bacon slice, maybe 1/2 Tbsp of cheddar cheese. A few tomatoes. Good amount of chicken. How does that consist of a salad? So disappointing."}
{"text":"No changes ever needed to a good ole Arby's large roast beef sandwich.  They've renamed it over the years and added melted cheddar when you want it, but the fact is, it is still a big roast beef sandwich and it's always been good.

This Arby's is located righ across from In and Out burgers so just getting into and out of the parking lot can be a hastle on a busy Friday night.  The Arby's is always fast and rarely do I ever have people in front of me.

Pricing has been a bit high for fast food unfortunately, otherwise I would be back more often.  Their sliders are worth a try if you want to sample one of their other signature sandwiches.   I'll come back for sure, just not as often as I would like to."}
{"text":"Fast Food is not my favorite place to dine but we decided to stop in and try the new Philly sandwich they were promoting and put it to a test.

Let me say that I was pleasantly surprised as the sandwich was hot, juicy and full of flavor.  The shell of the bread was crusty yet soft and delicate inside.  

When I placed my order, I told the woman behind the counter I had not eaten here in sometime and this might make or break my decision to come back.  She was very polite, used my name, promoted the new item and then brought it to my table when it was ready.

Overall the customer service at this sore was exceptional for a fast food joint.  The sandwich was tasty and I would certainly go back for another."}
{"text":"Apparently, this is one of the original Arby's in the Phoenix area. The restaurant itself is nothing special. It's just an Arby's. 

The customer service is always polite and professional. The food tastes like Arby's and the turnovers are delicious! 

The decor is old but maintained really well. The inside could use a remodel but it's not in bad condition; just older style. I like it! :)"}
{"text":"Love their turkey sandwiches. Not the best ever but definitely good! Great for fast food. Employees are nice and do a good job."}
{"text":"The dining room closes at dusk, which varies from month-to-month, and it's downright nasty.  Nothing like an Arbys should be."}
{"text":"Poor services and very rude. Another customer asked where his receipt was and the guy was like was on the counter. It wasn't there. I pretty much got my food shoved at me. The worker is never in a good mood."}
{"text":"The last time I went to this Arby's my order was not complete! I had to turn around after realizing 2 miles later- I tell the guy he didn't give me my fries... As I wait in the drive thru line the lady in front of me was trying to get the guys attention cuz he didn't give her her drink and as I pull up the the window- he sticks my food out the window and says nothing! No I'm sorry- no let me give u a free dessert for not doing my job right- nothing.... RUDE!!"}
{"text":"Every time I com here, the mess up my order. They have about 7 people working back there and  they still can't get it right."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to for all of evil goodies! Tracie, the assistant manager always makes it enjoyable to come here, especially when Chuy is making the sandwiches you can't go wrong with this Arby's!!"}
{"text":"They serve roast beef, turkey, french dip, steak and chicken sandwiches.  There are two kinds of fries: curly and plain.  Potato cakes are unique to Arby's.  Jamocha, vanilla, and chocolate shakes are standard items.  Mozzarella sticks and jalapeno bites are also sold.  This location has great staff with a positive attitude."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite location.  I have been coming here for years.  The staff is one of the friendliest in the biz.  I rarely have had an issue, but whenever I have, the staff have gone above and beyond to resolve and/or compensate for the error.  I also appreciate the fact that they make an effort to remember the names of regular guests, no matter how infrequent.  I'm thinking THIS Arby's!"}
{"text":"ONCE UPON A TIME...

So usually this Arby's provides a typical fast food experience, but tonight was below average.  Cold, soggy potato cakes; sloppily made beef n' cheddar complete with sauce on the outside of the wrapper (now on my pants); poor communication with much unnecessary repeating of my order, despite only 1 car in front of me and none behind.  

But as a side note:  once upon a time this Arby's was phenomenal!!  There were two specific ALL-STARS who worked there named Vince (or Vic) and Shannon who provided customer service, food quality, and an experience far better than one would expect at a mid-priced sit down restaurant, let alone a fast food establishment.  And nobody on the team at that time gave less than 100%.  I frequent this location much, much less since its decline and tonight was a reminder of why.

It may sound ridiculous to read this on a Yelp review, but I hope those two are gainfully employed and being appreciated for their value and potential.  And if they ever need a job reference, I will highly recommend them.  

And such is the story of Solon Arby's."}
{"text":"The one thing that I like about Arby's is the curly fries, so one night when I was craving it, we made the trip over to this remote location and let's just say the fries was anything from fulfilling the curly fries craving. The fries was cold and undoubtedly been sitting out for a while prior to being served. 

Aside from the cold fries, the chicken tenders tasted dry and incredibly hard to bite into. I couldn't even finish eating my meal because it just wasn't any appetizing and that's just quite disappointing. 

Needless to say, the attendant at the drive-thru seemed quite snappy and not at all friendly. 

Perhaps, it would be a different scenario if the food was more freshly prepared. Although, I did visit this location late into the night, I would have hope that all the food no matter the hour would be equally as delicious. This Arby failed to reach that mark, and for these reasons, I'd pass on coming to this location in the near future unless something drastically changes."}
{"text":"W 117th St is always overshadowed by Tremont, E 4th, Ohio City or whatever is the new flavor of the month. This is one of the true culinary hubs of the city and cranks out food 24-7. You can be like Tom Waits and hang with the nighthawks at the diner at My Friends or Tina's, or just stop by Arby's at any time for a wonderful roast beef sandwich. The initials of roast beef are RB. I would venture to guess that this is how they came up with the name Arby's. I would prefer Rax. I take what I can get."}
{"text":"I'm not about reviewing fast food places, but I found out this Arby's was the first in Pittsburgh. It even has the HUGE cowboy hat out front as a marker. 

It has all the stuff you'd expect, Roast Beef sandwiches, and those amazing Jamocha Shakes Arby's is known for."}
{"text":"When I was a carnivore, Arby's was one of my favorite places for a quick bite. I didn't really care for the roast beef. I did in fact love the Market sandwiches. My favorite was the turkey Caesar. It was billed as a healthy alternative to burgers and other fatty foods people indulge in at fast food joints. Let's face it the marketing department billed it as being on whole wheat bread, moist white meat turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onion. They neglected to mention the bread was grilled and the Caesar dressing was put in so liberally that the fat content was higher than a Big Mac. 

So I said goodbye to Arby's and hello to a vegan lifestyle. To be fare, Arby's Curley fries are pretty amazing along with the famous Jamocha shakes. Arby's also has the best bbq sauce and that horsey sauce is amazing on their fish sandwich.

I like this location, totally revamped and cozy."}
{"text":"I could eat an Arby's roast beef sandwich every single day of my life and be very happy with that decision. Arby's is fantastic I love Arby's it is like the elite fast food restaurant feels like you're fine dining when you're eating at the Arby's. It's awesome that great deals at a what every month and they send them Arby coupons in the mail I'm like woo-hoo good stuff we're going to the Arby's now the only problem is it's like$20 compared to McDonalds $8 but the food at Arby's is fantastic I love Arby's highly recommend"}
{"text":"had there new gyro taste ok,needs more meat very thin sliced meat and more sauce.i asked for more sauce on the side for a togo order,not in the bag when i got back to work with it,not s surprise"}
{"text":"I went to this location and ordered 3 fish sandwiches two of them were plain.  When I got home only one was plain. I called the store and talk to the manager he said the next time just bring back  in the receipt and he would replace the sandwich not a problem.  I brought back the sandwich and receipt and there was a problem.   He said it been too long and he would not honor it.  A Mistake is a mistake I'm not sure why one week makes a big difference but it did to them. Treated rudely and will never be back."}
{"text":"I don't like to eat at fast food burger joints, but it was late, and I was ready to eat aboyt anything. I ordered the spicy jalapeno brisket sandwich. It was great! It was spicy! I saw real diced jalapenos in therek, and the brisket beef was very good. Looked and tasted like real meat. Not at all like the meat that is found on any of their original menu sandwiches. For those of you, (like me), who can't get past the pressed meat deal, I think you'll be happy with this quality of meat. At least I thought the quality tasted good. I was so hungry I inhaled that sandwich... burning tongue and all. My teenage son ordered it too, and didn't think it was very spicy. So there are two different opinions. Can't comment on anything else, because that' s all I ordered. I'd order it again too, although it says 'limited time only.'"}
{"text":"This is most likely the most efficient Arby's restaurant I've ever been to. They were fast inand efficient  in the drive-through and my order was ready by the time I turned to the  window. Everyone was kind and friendly and I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I'm 25, live across the street from an Arby's and I've never been to one until the other night. 
The Pros: they have a chicken cordon bleu sandwich. Need I say more? Haha it was very fresh and hot when I got it which was nice. The curly fries are delicious, especially with their SAUCES! I had never had Arby's sauce (their version of BBQ sauce) and I put it on absolutely every bite. I also enjoyed their Parmesan Garlic house chips that are made daily, they're a little over a dollar, but quite delightful. 

The cons: Their customer service is terrible. There was no one there when we walked in at night, just two employees drinking the bottled sodas that they offer. It took them 4 minutes to turn around and that's after I, the customer, greeted the employees. The response instead of a \"hey welcome, what can I get for you?\" was a sigh, blank stare and hand on the register. Um, I'm guessing that means you're ready to take my order? Rude rude and more rude. Who is the hiring manager here and why do they suck at their job? 


I'm just saying. I won't be back. Customer service and food quality should go hand-in-hand, Fast food or fine dining alike. This place isn't even close to having subpar service. 
I'll save my breath and go to the jack in the box across the street. 100x better service."}
{"text":"Arby's issued a a coupon for a free slider if you purchase a sandwich or meal at full price.   June 7 -13 2017.  I purchased 4 sandwiches and 1 meal at full price.  They refused to provide 5 free sliders they reluctantly offered me one .      The coupon does not  reference restrictions.    I asked to speak with the manager who was on the store.   He / she refused to speak with me and disappeared into the back of the store.   This place is unethical and managed by spineless ."}
{"text":"Cold fries and didn't properly bag my food so my French dip was All over my bag waste of money don't go at the Nightshift."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Order was accurate.  It tasted great and familiar like any other Arby's I've been to.  Only anomoly was they only had sauce in packets and the sauce was limited to Arby's Sauce and Horsey Sauce; there we no sauce pumps.  However, another top notch Arby's for sure."}
{"text":"First visit we ate in and the staff was super friendly, and willing to customize. Hubby didn't want the bun and asked for a side of lettuce to wrap it up in and once they realized what the lettuce was for they wrapped it up for him. I had the cordon bleu as it's the reason I crave Arby's...and them curly fries! Tonight hit the drive through had a short wait but the chicken will be fresh:) a min or two after the guy taking my order and money told me we were waiting on my chicken another lady approached asked how I was and informed me the same thing; this is customer service especially at a fast food joint. Seems like the staff and management know were the focus should be not only in cleanliness and fresh food customer service is the reason I drove to this in vs the one on craig rd which is typically bad service and careless food service. Must have been out of normal ham for the cordon wish they would have told me and wish I would have gotten the sauces  (Arby's and horsey )asked go when was first asked( my bad I didn't double check or respond to second ask if I wanted ketchup)  this is why I did 3 stars; but I think they have better potential! great job Arby's team keep it up all details are important they did put the side salad in separate bag so it's not wilted by time u get home!!"}
{"text":"This is a above average Arby's.  The service was great  and the food was fresh and delicious.  Try the mozzarella sticks here. Very good for fast food."}

{"text":"it's arbys.  not a mystery.  staff was friendly and facility was neat and clean.  food came out fast."}
{"text":"The slowest place in Vegas. Took 15 minutes from placing order to getting our food. People are nice but I've never seen people work so slow. Maybe they are under staffed? I wouldn't go to this location if there was another to go to. They need more Arbys."}
{"text":"Wish they had more locations. I always get the beef and cheddar. Today I tried the bourbon. I could have just put BBQ sauce on it and not known the difference. No bourbon flavor in it at all. :(. But can never go wrong with curly fries and cheese!"}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least.  First visit was not great. Long wait time, cold fries and a manager who just doesn't care.  He won't even acknowledge your there or smile 
So I figured I would try a second time.  Same thing very long wait even though they had only one other customer there and the manager once again had such a poor attitude towards his new employee who was then taking my order.  All the kid did was ask for help and all he got was an attitude.  
Oh and by the way there's a phone number and email address up in the wall for there regional manager so I emailed her twice guess what no response.  

I'm done.  They won't see me again."}
{"text":"Arby's...who isn't a fan? I have been a lover of Arby' since I was a kid.  I am not a huge fast food person, but when I am there are definitely a few places I will go and Arby's is one of them.  Unfortunately I never get anything other then the classic roast beef. And let me tell you you definitely cannot go wrong with it.  A perfectly toasted sesame bun with a generous portion of thinly sliced roast beef, topped with Arby's sauce and you are set! Their fries also never disappoint either.
The King's Drive location has never disappointed, always serving fresh sandwiches, fries and customer service.  I will definitely continue to be a visitor, when I get the roast beef craving!"}

{"text":"I forgot they built a bunch of FF places along Deer Valley Rd over the last several years, until my bro Daren C reminded me (shout out).

I've been making the rounds to various area Arby's using the shit out of the free BBQ Bacon Cheddar Roastburger (arbys.com/coupon and today's the last day!)

I thought I'd try out another store to avoid wearing out my welcome on Bell Rd., and I'm glad I did.

This is a clean, efficient operation.  The building's pretty new, with a large dining area full of a variety of walled areas and nooks and crannies, giving many of the tables a private feel.
There's even a big atrium window, and a real, live 15' or so ficus tree growing indoors out of the floor in the dining area.  Great atmosphere for this kind of place.

The service was quick and friendly.  I could tell that the young guy at the counter thought the manager barking orders was being a dick, but he took it in stride, smiling and saying \"yes, sir\" the whole time.  \"richard\" the manager was only doing what it takes to keep a FF store running smoothly, though, and young guy will someday get a job selling cars or something, and look back thankfully on all 'richard' taught him about  upselling and add-ons, smiling and being friendly. 

Bad on Arby's for getting rid of regular french fries, though, as they now only have curly or potato cakes (which are great, but i always appreciate variety).
btw BBQ Bacon Cheddar Roastburger kicks butt."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving this Arby's a one star review is because of their horrible customer service. The drive through attendant, Miles, is the rudest POS I've ever encountered in a fast food setting. Not once did he say \"thank you,\" \"please,\" \"you're welcome,\" etc. He barely spoke at all except to argue with me when I made him aware that we were one drink short wherein which he had the audacity to tell me that he gave me all of my drinks. He then proceeded to act irritated and dismissive regarding my concern. Trust me, I'm not going to try to grift you out of a drink that costs $1.85. Give me a break. Then he decided he was going to charge me for the drink he neglected to give me. Seriously? lmao Bro, I ordered four meals which each come with a drink. You only gave me three drinks. Why the hell are you going to charge me for one you already owe me? Nobody is forcing you to work at Arby's. If you don't like your job, then quit. Do us all a favor. He kind of reminds me of Butt Head from Beavis and Butt Head, but at least they had manners. Heed my warning. If you pull up to this drive through and you hear a voice that kinda sounds like Kat Williams, just drive away. It's Butt Head on the other end and he really doesn't like his job. The manager was no better. She claimed she was in the back the whole time and was completely unaware of Butt Head's (Miles) behavior. Sure you were. They're just so hard up for employees that they probably can't afford to lose any more so I doubt anything will happen to this kid. Shame too because he doesn't deserve to have a job in customer service. Since he doesn't like to say much, he should try his hand at being a mime instead."}

{"text":"All information online says they are open until eleven pm, yet they are are closed at 10:14!  Please correct your hours of operation information, wast of time and gas!"}
{"text":"\"Sorry, but we ran out of roast beef.\"  You're Arby's, how do you run out of roast beef at noon?
I would have let this slide but after sitting in line for 10 min., I received cold fries and no thank you."}
{"text":"I was an assistant manager at another arbys in California so I know the ins and outs of arbys.  Let me tell you that this particular \"restaurant\" is a disgrace to all other arbys.  The workers act like they don't want to be there.  They look at you like they want to spit in your face.  They talk to you like you are a nuisant and is bothering them.  They frequently miss items on your order unless you watch them like a hawk and correct their mistake.  I was served by a \"crew manager\" (probably) last week and I got the same experience.  No wonder the employees also behave this way.  I can tell you not all arbys are the same and this location should be shut down."}
{"text":"15 mins for fast food and the woman that handed it to me had taken off her visor, ran her hands on the sides of her sweaty hair, put her visor back in and proceeded to pick up our sandwiches and fries and put them on our tray and never washed her hands. Not ok! And my sandwich was totally wrong and I'm not going back up - I don't have that kind of time to spend"}
{"text":"I love Arby's food for the most part and was disappointed when they recently closed down the restaurant near my home. There is one still open on the way to work so I stop there from time to time on the way. I am only writing this because something has happened on consecutive visits that makes me think it wasn't a fluke or a bad day, it's just the way it is now. Last week I pulled up and ordered one roast turkey and Swiss sandwich ala carte. I pull around and wait behind the car in front of me for 15 mins. Not even mad because I have no idea what they ordered or how much so I wait patiently. I pull up to the window and pay for my sandwich when it's my turn and I wait 10 more minutes for a turkey sandwich. The girl was in no way apologetic, and borderline rude while she left the window open and I watched and listened to her just stand and shoot the stuff with her coworkers, including those making the food. An off day I think. Go through yesterday. The girl that greets me over the intercom tries to tell me she needs a minute but doesn't make sense to the point where she tries correcting herself and just starts laughing and goes dark. Eventually she comes back and I order a roast turkey and Swiss but a wrap this time. Pull around and wait again 15 mins for the car in front of me. Get to the window and get my food and drive away already late for work to realize they gave me something completely different from what I had ordered. No time to turn around or make it right because I was already late for work. And I know what you're thinking but I allowed myself 20 mins to get a sandwich and get to work with time to spare. That should be more than enough time to go through a drive through for a cold cut sandwich. I work in fine dining and don't expect the same level from Arby's but I do expect professionalism, a sense of urgency, pride in your job, and ensuring the quality of what you serve to your guests. Seems like an unsupervised teenage party going on in that store and as much as I love the food won't be going there again."}
{"text":"If you enjoy waiting for your roast beef to be grass fed and raised in the back while you wait for 15yrs for your food to be ready, then this is the place for you!

The drive through is very smartly designed in such a way that once youve been waiting 20min, you cant leave because youre sandwiched in between the person in front of you who is still waiting to order l, and the girl behind you playing candycrush.

After celebtating both my 30th and 31st birthday in line, i was pleased to receive the wrong order with cold fries.

The only thing that could have improved the experience would have been getting sprayed with tactical pepper spray and contracting HIV.

{"text":"This place is a total rip-off.

I remember back in the day when you got a nice, meat filled sandwich and didn't have to pay extra.  They've changed their menu (quite awhile ago) to have different sizes of sandwiches.  The prices are outrageous, in my opinion.  I mean, this is fast food, it shouldn't cost as much as a trip to Applebees.

Today was my first visit to Arby's in a very long time, and I am sure it will be quite a while before I return.  My Mom wanted to go there so we could get the 2 for $6 reuben sandwiches.  That is a decent deal, because 1 sandwich alone is normally $6.19.  The combo is over $8 - that is crazy to me!

The service is friendly, but horribly slow.  The food always seems hot and fresh.  Today was ridiculous.  We were the 2nd car in line waiting to order, and this took about 15 minutes.  Then it took even longer at the window.  The cashier apologized profusely, saying that they got \"slammed\" in the restaurant and there were only 2 of them working.  He offered us a free drink for the wait.  We declined, but I appreciate the offer.  When he gave us our food, he said he threw in some free cheese sauce for the fries, which was a nice gesture.

I think that there is a reason that you don't see a lot of Arby's like you do other chains.  Their product isn't that great, and extremely overpriced.  Do yourself a favor and make your beef 'n cheddars at home

UPDATE: Apparently I posted this review for the wrong location (oops!). Glad I caught that, because I also wanted to add another recent experience:

Every single time we drive thru here, there is a problem with the shake machine.  I want a damn jamocha shake!  One time, they were out of flavoring and nobody knew how to refill it.  The next time the shake machine had apparently \"froze over.\"  I get more annoyed each time I go.  Also, apparently they no longer serve the potato bites or squares or whatever they are (this is what they told my dad today, although they are still on the menu).  Something about this location FAILS everytime I go there. And there are much better, easier and cheaper options nearby."}

{"text":"Very disappointed with, well just about everything with this specific Arby's.  The order was wrong, the counter lady was almost downright rude and, no, they will not honor the senior citizen discount.  Management has their hands full with this hot mess.  It's worth the drive to go to the one on Stephanie."}
{"text":"The service here is so slow. 
The microphone is bad. 
The people taking your order don't speak clear English. 
They don't give receipts
I spend 14 minuets in the drive through
I'll never go back. 
I have this location 2 stars (instead of 1 because the food was good)
Horrible service though"}

As a matter of fact, I've going here for years and I don't think I've ever had a bad experience."}

{"text":"Saw the sign for their gyro so thought I'd try it. Super! Pita very soft and even though I decided to get turkey, the sauce and flavorings made it close to a regular lamb gyro! But Arby's just has beef as their other option and I don't eat beef. Maybe too much taziki sauce but all good!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty gross.  It's dirty.  The gas station it's attached to need a massive overhaul.  The employees are sketchy-looking at best.  Have some standards, Arby's."}
{"text":"There was a hair inside my beef and cheddar and I couldn't eat it. Really grossed out"}
{"text":"I went and ordered onion rings and when I got home I noticed their was only 3 .  Really 3 onion rings for $2 .   I will never go back"}
{"text":"Sandwich was good.
Service was bad. Little teenage girl laughed at me when I stuttered while giving my order.
Iced tea tasted like fish, which means they don't clean their iced tea container often, which means they probably don't clean most things very often.
Only gave them 2 stars because the sandwich was as expected."}
{"text":"Being that this is the only fast food that is easily accessible between Uptown and Sardis Road, I have to stop here frequently to get my daughter something to eat before dance practice.  We always go through the drive-through.  Service is always excellent and the wait time is minimal.  I can't complain when her stomach is growling (which it does frequently) as Arby's fits the bill."}
{"text":"Here I go again with chain fast food restaurants. Look sometimes you have to review them. Most especially if it's to shout out kudos to the local employees who work there. With that said, this Arby's location is always immaculate. The food is fresh and fast (they're always busy) and the people working never lose their cool. In fact quite the opposite as they seem excited to work with the public in what can sometimes be a thankless job."}
{"text":"I don't do fast food often but when I do it's always Arby's. This location opened today and it's going to be a real problem for me. Wondering why? I'll tell you, it's because the location is at the end of my street. It's located at the corner of Cypress and Baum. A three minute walk. I'm going to get fat! Especially since my boyfriend was #7 out of the first 50 customers today. What's that mean? It means he gets one free meal a week for a year. We tend to share plates when out so maybe that will cut down on the calorie intake. Sure it's a chain restaurant but it's delicious. I'll tell you that even though this was day One and the place was hopping, the service levels were above and beyond any fast food place I've been. Even other Arby's locations. As far as the food goes, you know what you're getting here. You either like it or not. Or in this case love it. But when it comes to fast food it's not often that service is as it should be. The employees have exceeded expectations. I honestly do see it continuing as such; everyone seemed to really love being there. :)"}
{"text":"Went to this location yesterday because I heard the Pecan Chicken Salad Sandwich ($4.69) is back! OMG it's amazing....it sounds weird but it's chunks of chicken, grapes, apples, pecans, and mayo on wheat bread with lettuce.  It's 870 calories but eff it....YOLO"}
{"text":"This is a great location for Arby's.  They have great roast beef sandwiches.  And I love putting about 3oz of the Arby's sauce on the sandwich.  I have not liked any of the special sandwiches.... Just stick with the roast beef and get the curly fries. This place has the hat sign out front, that's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Arby's, ripping people off since forever. 2 for $6 French Dip is supposed to be 1lb of food. Another reason I never eat fast food, such a ripoff BTW these are supposed to be a 1/2 lbs each. According to the scale these are 7 ozs or 0.4375 lbs I should have known it was too good to be true. The sandwich is horrible on top of it."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times but this time will be my last. I order the same thing as usual a market fresh sandwich and I was shocked when I got home and saw the little amount of meat I received for just over $8. Normally this sandwich is piled high with ham... so disappointed and still hungry. I had to combine both halves to make a normal half sandwich. I wont be back too inconsistent."}
{"text":"Drive thru: Ordered a turkey wrap, no tomato (I'm allergic). Of course, when I got my wrap, it had tomato. And the rest of the ingredients were sloppy and covered with excessive sauce. Curly fries were obviously cooked a long time before I got there. Anyway, went inside to get my order corrected and the teenagers that were working were helpful and polite. However, the \"cook\" was rude about making the correct order. I accepted the fact he got it right and hurried home. Surprise, surprise, he did not. Once again all the ingredients were slopped together on a stale wrap. There was ranch and mayo on it, no mustard. Seems silly, but that's not even a correct order yet again. I have ordered here before, almost always have an issue but tonight was the last time. Go elsewhere. Carl's Jr and Capriottis are across the street. Give them your business."}
{"text":"Talk about rudeness at the drive-thru. The employee is speaking fast. You have a busy street in the background. And, really? You're copping an attitude if I ask you to repeat yourself? 

No wonder this is a 2-Star fast food restaurant. ?"}
{"text":"This place has been remodeled and fully updated.  The sanitation grade posted is a 98.5!  I feel like this restaurant is very clean. The employees are courteous.   My order was correct and the food was good.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This is the one location that I get consistently good food from. Sometimes the sandwich bread is stale but at least the potato cakes are OK and the roast beef sandwiches have been good."}
{"text":"Used to the love the place..used to be very kind, fast, and efficient. Now the place is a disaster. Walked in and there was a whole line of people waiting for food and only one cashier ringing out. Upon getting rung out, one of the employees was painting behind the menu and ending up dumbing it and the blank paint ended up covering the cashier and the people in line especially me..didn't bother apologizing for it or offering anything to us. Employees in the back were screaming with each other and throwing stuff at each other. Ended up taking forever to receive our food afterwards. Our order was messed up and a sandwich was forgotten, other sandwiches that usually come precut did not this time around and overall a very bad experience getting covered in black paint and poor service."}
{"text":"I do not know anything else that I can say, but tonight experience at this local restaurant was terrible.

As I pulled into the drive-thru I observed several people standing in front of the restaurant entrance, after waiting for several minutes no one came over the speaker to take my order. I pulled around to ask the employees if someone will take my order only to be laughed at... I again pulled around to look for a corporate telephone number to which I was unsuccessful.

Bottom line, don't waste your time if you are trying to get some food in the later part of the evening at this location. They have posted hours but refuse to take an order... Disgusting customer service"}
{"text":"Always love Arby's but the 2 stars reflects solely on the window service; 40 min wait for my order.  I would suggest another location to get your fix even at this time of night (8pm)"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Poorly run business. Waited over 15 minutes to tell me no bags of ice."}
{"text":"Past 3 times I've came they've messed up my order.. They're always nice and fix it but just a hassle going back and having to wait another 5 minutes in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
I have never been to a arby's before today and I would say I actually like it a lot. They had the new smokehouse burger which was brisket smoked for 12+ hours. The food is prepared fresh, service was friendly. The store itself was super clean as well. The only major problem is the parking lot is small and we had to circle around twice to get a parking spot. 

Pro: curly fries, friendly fast service

Cons: small parking lot

{"text":"funny their ad say we have the meats  Its the worst fake processed meats   everything is cheap processed crap"}
{"text":"This Arby's is super strange. We only came here because we were hungry, on the road, and needed something fast. The food was as mediocre as Arby's ever is and the atmosphere was really bizarre. Couldn't understand a word that came out of the cashier's mouth. They were blaring some awful Fox News show on TV. The place was full of creepy dudes staring at each other and us. Ugh."}
{"text":"We love getting the family dinner. We get coupons in the mail for the family dinner! $15 bucks for aa bunch of food is what I'm talking about"}
{"text":"Went so far out of her way to hit an Arby's my wife just had a hankering for it but we are gravely disappointed.  We were the only people in the parking lot and in the store the was no one else yet somehow they messed up an order for a beef and cheddar really!!! 

It's too damn late to go out now what am I supposed to do my wife hates barbecue sauce. The manager was kind pleasant and she's offering to replace my meal but it's not worth another 20 minute drive. 

The Rant if and angry yelper!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Arby's food, but I'm giving this location only two stars because they ALWAYS mess up my order.  EVERY TIME!  If you go to this Arby's location, CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU PULL AWAY OR LEAVE."}
{"text":"Below average, compared to other Arby's. The 16 year old kid, at the counter, had no knowledge of the menu whatsoever. I don't eat a lot of fast food, so I asked a couple questions. \"What comes on the grilled chicken sandwich?\" He turned around, looked up at the menu, and described the picture to me. \"Looks like lettuce, tomato & cheese.\" I could see the photo on the menu board. I was curious if it came with mayo and what type of cheese it had. Since my curiosity was not satisfied, I decided to move on to something else. \"What's on the loaded Italian?\" He said, \"Hmm..That's a good question.\" He found a printed menu and read the description to me, \"ham, salami, pepperoni, provolone, banana peppers, lettuce, tomato, red wine vinaigrette and garlic aioli\". So I went with the loaded Italian. It wasn't great. They microwave the meats together. The pepperoni was on top, and it was so greasy that the top of the bun was stained orange from all the grease seeping into it. It looked really good in the picture, but what I got was nowhere close to the picture. It was not aesthetically pleasing!
Everyone else's food was satisfactory. Beef & cheddar, junior roast beef and curly fries all met mediocre expectations. Just keep your expectations low, and you probably won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went threw drive thru got gyros and roast beef the kid in the drive threw was rude gave him coupons and still was trying to charge different prices I had to have fix it a few times had no smile and nothing he looked pissed or not happy with his job almost drove off and went somewhere else"}
{"text":"Employees here are very rude. Management must make them very unhappy at this place of employment to have such poor attitudes and for them to be so unhappy."}
{"text":"Call me old school. I know it's fast food, but a beef and cheddar with Arby's sauce on it takes me back in time. It taste the same and consistently the same since I was a kid. I'm no fool, it's not like going and getting a fresh roast beef sandwich, but you can't get anything like it anywhere else."}
{"text":"This Arby's is an absolute train wreck. Go at your own risk. 

Guy and girl with stroller making out for 20 minutes straight at 11 AM on a weekday... check.

Booth next to Coke machine has caution tape on it like there was a murder there.... yeeeep. It was up for months. 

Customer or homeless person passed out and looks like he's been there for hours... you bet. 

Poorly made food at at an overpriced rate.... done and done.   Just like me going here again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if there is any point in reviewing fast food.

But I have been here and have had an experience here.

I used to get the roast beef sandwiches. Thinly sliced roast beef and salted. Sometimes I would eat just the slices and not the bun. They were good before I saw Supersize Me and Food Inc, and after that my opinion of them is irreversible.

I once tried to eat vegetarian in here, and I remember not being able to get a salad without chicken because it was pre-packaged that way.

This location at least is 2 minutes away from a gas station, so I now go there to get something healthy like a Naked juice and string cheese and bring it to my scheduled event at Arby's."}
{"text":"10 minutes at the drive thru speaker before our order was taken. 15 minutes to get to the window (2 cars in front of us). Employee at the window lost our order. When we finally got it, the buns were not toasted and the roast beef was cold. 
Now, I have a fat ass for a reason. I eat at Arby's as well as other fast food establishments, so I am something of an expert. What we received was a minimum wage effort for a minimum wage job.
I have a hard time finding fault in a person who is only qualified to work at Arby's trying to eek out an existence on $8.00 an hour.
I have also found that the employees who hustle and work their ass of don't stick around long, because they are motivated to make something of themselves. So maybe the answer is to have these workers ware a name badge with the number of years they have worked there. This way, we can excuse the person who has been there a long time and can assume they don't care about the customers. Conversely, we should expect the young new employee to be \"Johnny on the spot\".   Regardless, don't eat at this Arby's."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal Arby's customer for 20+ something years and this is the worst Arby's.  They are always polite but the food is always awful!  I have gone back 5 times now and keep HOPING the next time will be better, but it never is.  Sadly, I will not go back.  What happened Arby's?  Hoping I can find another one close by."}
{"text":"Have not been to Arby's in a while, but got some good coupons and gave them a try again.
Pleasantly surprised. French dip sandwich was  large, tasty and on a good roll. Au jus served on the side was intense and beefy. Onion rings nice and crunchy, potato cakes better than average. Order taker very courteous, and they got everything right! 
If you haven't tried them in a while, worth considering."}
{"text":"This was the first time I was at this Arby's at this location.  It. Looks fairly new and very clean. The food was not up to par. The chicken strips where not hot and either was the beef sandwich. The curly fries tasted like they have been sitting for a while . The weird thing was is we just got done paying and food was ready it was faster than a microwave. Don't think we will return there"}
{"text":"Just horrible food and I emailed Katie with no response on my experience ? The store was super clean but that can be good and bad as I think their serving old food as I been eating Beef and cheddars for 30 years and nothing ever tasted this bad !
They meat was falling apart almost crumbly with a mushy oatmeal texture ? Its should be sliced  and it didnt even taste like arbys ?
 I swear you could put that sauce and cheese on a shoe and it would taste great but not that slop .
Im down here from IL 6 months now and this is all there is for Arbys ? as this location is giving it a bad name so I guess Ill be calling corporate and hopefully they will fix your franchise or take it away . 
Dont know if its a preparation or quality issue BUT if you know Arbys quality and love their beef save your money because this isnt Arbys its cold slop on a stale bun .

UPDATE : I read other reviews and saw they had a broken meat slicer so thats why the crumble meat and other said the beef quality sucks so theres definitely something nasty going on there !"}
{"text":"I had never been to Arby's before until my roommate had me go with her. I was greeted immediately. Everyone was so genuine and nice, patient(being my first visit and I didn't know what I wanted) and the manager on duty was so sweet! She really knew how to run the place and didn't look miserable doing it. I was treated very well and the service was fast."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to an Arby's but I was suckered into stopping by after seeing a commercial promoting their French Dip (yum!) and I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised by the presentation and taste here, not smooshed or thrown together, and the meat was as fresh as fast food can be. I would also recommend their Market fresh sandwiches, the quality of the ingredients are often better than what I have from the store at home. 
The building is pretty washed out/old and there are usually not more than 2 cars in the parking lot so it looks closed down or abandoned but give this place a shot. The service is fast and friendly, food is not greasy at all and the overall quality of ingredients are far better and fresher than most fast food places around here."}
{"text":"I used to like Arby's. Although prices are on the higher end of fast food chains, I have always been a fan of their Beef 'N Cheddar Sandwich (I usually ask for a sesame seed bun because I don't like the onion roll). 

Lately, both the quality of their food and service have gone down hill. I also used to like the French Dip and Swiss, but the last 2 times I ordered it, the sandwich and the Au Jus has been flavorless. A few times, I decided to try other things on the menu, like the Chicken Bacon Swiss Sandwich and the Jr. Ham and Cheddar Melt, but both were very very salty. 

Service used to be good. I have never seen this place busy, but the employees have always been friendly. However, when I came here the other day, the employee at the register didn't even greet me. She just stood there staring into space, waiting for me to say something first. While I was waiting for my food, I could hear the drive thru intercom inside the restaurant. The employees were pretty much laughing at everyone who used the drive thru. 

2 good things about this place: a very clean dining room and they give you a lot of sauce for no extra charge."}
{"text":"Being that I live so close this is my go to Arby's. Well needless to say by the 2 stars the food is what you expect but minus 3 stars for the rude employees! If you don't like your job please quit and let someone that would appreciate a paycheck take your position! 

Drive thru is literally at a snails pace and then you get up to the window to rude employees so it makes for a really crappy experience. Based upon all the other reviews maybe corporate should step in and look at the bad reviews about the employees."}
{"text":"The food is good but it took over 15 minutes to get 2 roast beef sandwiches and then about 4 more minutes to get 1 medium order of fries. .. and there was only 3 customers in the store. This is unacceptable and needs to change or they will shut down very soon."}
{"text":"Thanks for forgetting the au jus sauce for my French dip... :( whole point of a French dip is to be able to dip it in au jus without it it's just a French nothing.... extremely disappointed after waiting almost 15 mins at the drive thru window for my food."}
{"text":"This location is always clean and the people are very friendly! Just a regular Arby's with consistently good food and service."}
{"text":"I would give negative stars if I could. The drive thru line was horribly long so we decided to dine in.  Upon walking in the floor seemed really dirty that should have been our first clue.  We ordered our food which took forever, didn't get our cups and had to repeatedly ask to get them. There was only another family inside. Every single table inside was dirty. I had asked for one to be cleaned and was given a rag. Should have left then.  I asked for small cups for sauces and was told he wasn't sure where they were and to use the tray.  Food took 25 minutes to come out and when it did it was cold and not everything was there. Ended up getting a refund after waiting for the manager (who seemed to be the only one truly doing his best). I used to like Arby's but we will NEVER return. Save yourself the trouble and stay away."}
{"text":"A fast food joint I don't get to frequent very often.  Though it's a bit pricey for \"fast food\", I'd have to say the quality is pretty delish.  I love their roast beef sandwiches smothered in Arby Sauce and Horsey Sauce.  I definitely miss the days of 5 for $5 sandwiches.  The sandwiches have definitely gotten smaller than back in the days, but still taste the same.  Their potato cakes are so crunchy and perfectly cooked.  I'd choose those over the curly fries.  Until we meet again...probably in another year."}
{"text":"I think the food and the service here are good i like this arbys better than Middlefield or madison they never forgot sauce or messed up my order inside seems clean enough too."}
{"text":"What happen to Steve,  Eh Manager was Yelling at staff for some reason. She seems very high strung.

Food Was great,
Service Was ok.
Everything looked ok after a Lunch Rush."}
{"text":"good food , good service. I am hooked on the roast beef sandwich and horse sauce. Very clean place."}
{"text":"I hope this is not a biased review, because I work next to this location, but you guys are truly great. I know you have to deal with a lot of frustrating customers, because of the location, but you guys are great. The food is always fresh and so amazing! Thank you for your great customer service and excellent food! One satisfied customer!!"}
{"text":"I do not eat alot of fast food, but when I do it is Arby's and it is at this location. 
The workers are always friendly and give you a smile.  
Food is always kept at the right temp and so far I have never had a messed up order.
  When I go inside, I always get the same smiling service.  They know what the new sandwiches are, how they are made and are eager to help you choose something new. Not my experience at any other Arby's in this area, so I will go out of my way to come to this one."}
{"text":"This Arby's has fantastic service and friendly people. Every time I've been to this Arby's I order has always been correct, and the food is always been hot and fresh. The only downside with this Arby's, sometimes the drive thru can take a little while. I would recommend this Arby's to anybody around"}
{"text":"I love this Arby's. Been here many times since it opened. The people who work there are so nice. The food is delicious. The Grand Turkey Club is my favorite. YUM! The drive-through is a bit slow but goodness, have you seen their large menu? Go inside, it's cute and cozy."}
{"text":"Not only is Arby's food amazing, but the staff was really nice.  My wife had a special request and they were able to take the time to accommodate it.  The guy who took our order was an older gentleman and the way he treated us was something I wish more people would take the time to do.  He only interacted with us for 15-30 seconds, but it left a nice, warm impression of him and the establishment"}
{"text":"I was craving curly fries and chicken tenders.  Service was super fast. There was one cashier but another quickly came to assist me before I had decided. I was also alerted that it would be a little while before the fries would be ready. Fresh, crunchy curlies are so delicious! I also got a free sandwich from signing up for the email deals. Place is clean. Will return."}
{"text":"Went into the restaurant and stood at counter a bit. My guess is the help was to busy laughing and cutting up to worry about serving me so I left and went somewhere else."}
