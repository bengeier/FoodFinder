{"text":"one thing -- there is this one man who works here, too bad he handles money and food without wearing gloves or washing his hands. you judge for yourself, but that's pretty nasty. I'd rather make my own bagel than get HIV at this place... but it's the thought that counts, right?"}
{"text":"I had a craving for a BLT the other day, so I wanted to check out Great Canadian Bagel since it always looks busy in there.  

It was quiet when I came in.  They have the selection of bagels behind glass.  There were about 12 choices.  I decided on maple, since I thought it would be good with the bacon.  The guy took my order and asked if I wanted it toasted, which is a given if you ask me.  The menu is very reasonably priced, plain bagels go for $1, half a dozen $5.  The additions like cream cheese and butter are only a few cents.  They have all day breakfast sandwiches, most going for around $5.  You can add on a drink for another $1.50.  They have some awesome cream cheeses!  There was red pepper, jalapeno, garlic, herbs and spice, to name only a few.  You can get a container of cream cheese for $4.50.  The guy made my bagel, asking if I wanted mustard or mayo.  The bagel and a drink cost $6.50.  It was the most amazing BLT bagel I have ever had!  

I loved Great Canadian Bagel, I can't wait to go back and try more of their fresh bagels and cream cheeses!  I would definitely hit this place up for a yummy breakfast sandwich too!"}
{"text":"I come to this Great Canadian Bagel about three times a week on my way to work. The guy behind the counter (Jack, the owner) always remembers me and we have this funny \"barber shop\" kind of banter. He always asks me the same questions, I always give him the same answers.

I always order the same things, either the Western Sausage or the Turkey club. The bagels are excellent-you can watch them making them through a window to the kitchen. 

The place isn't the cleanest, but surely has some delicious bagels.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Used to be the bomb for a bagel sandwich, is now under new ownership, the place looks run down and disorganized. 
Staff have no proper food handling skills (gloves when prepping food) the loxs (salmon) was warm, not even slightly chilled.
two sandwiches, a single dink was $18.00
Buy a bagel and make your sandwich at home."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie to you - I try to be carb conscious. But AS IF you haven't had THAT day. The day when no matter what you eat, or how much of it you eat, you're still hungry. All the fruits and veggies in the world just aren't gonna cut it. You want BREAD. Fresh, warm, crispy, delicious bread. Enter The Great Canadian Bagel.

Yesterday I was having THAT day. Soooooo hungry. I was walking past The Great Canadian Bagel and while my butt said \"Nooooo! Don't dooooo it\" my stomach said \"Go for it\". So obviously I did.

Why have I never been here before?!?!?!? WHY?!?!? It's like a museum of bagels. Every kind of bagel you could imagine, they sell. And not only do they sell them, they use them to feed you in-house.

I ordered a veggie bagel sandwich with soup and let me tell you: DELICIOUS. They toasted the bagel for me so it was nice and hot and the ingredients were fresh. The sandwich was finger-lickin' good and the soup warmed me to the core. You wanna know the best part? After I was done eating, I got a dozen bagels to go. OH NO YOU DID-N'T!!! Oh yes I did. And you wanna know something else? Breakfast this morning couldn't have been better ;)"}
{"text":"I was in northwest Calgary one day and we were hungry and on the prowl for some good cheap eats. Out of the corner of my eye(from starbucks) I noticed the great canadian bagel. i exclaimed \"ooh, i remember that place! I used to go their when I was a kid and watch them make bagels with their bagel machine!\" ( used to be a location in willow park years ago) So my sister replied \"uuuhhh I don't know that place has gone way down hill since those days!\" I replied \"well we have to try and see if they are as good as I remember!\"  So I dragged My sister and our friend from out of town to have a quick lunch at GCB....

To make a long story short the bagels were terrible, we ordered pizza bagels which tasted and looked like they had been sitting in a dorm room for a couple of days and absorbing all the surrounding smells( the ham tasted like it was on the verge of being rotten the cheese was nasty). I also ordered a normal sesame bagel with dill cream cheese. The bagel itself was very stale almost as if it was two days old. Yep It was that stale. The cream cheese was actually good! and served as the axl grease to get the stale bagel down the hatch. I regretted eating the whole thing though, wasted calories hahahaha...

I must say that the selection seemed scarce and this location showed signs of lack of business. Judging from all of the bagels we got, they were not fresh at all. All three of us had bad bagel faces and confided in our mutual borderline experience.Of course I got blamed for choosing this place hahaha. I felt terrible for bringing my friend from out of town here! I am glad he was forgiving and that we laughed it off. 

The guy working behind the counter was friendly but had a HUGE argument with the customer after us, something about differences from franchise to franchise. It was off putting to say the least and made us want to leave quickly.

So I hate to rip this place down but I feel like it is my duty to warn the yelping public that the bagels I had were terrible.  I was certainly expecting much better and was sad to see that chain has lost its former luster and appeal. Sorry GCB i cant come back.... ok well maybe if its the only option..."}
