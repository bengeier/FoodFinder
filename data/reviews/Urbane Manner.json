{"text":"This place is new and trying very hard to bring some excellent food, service and atmosphere to an area that demands it.  The manager was extremely attentive, food was excellent and wait staff was great. I hope this place does well, they deserve it!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for a soft open. Great atmosphere and the food heavenly!  Will be back soon. Good luck on your new place!"}
{"text":"I am reviewing the nightclub part of Urbane Manner not the breakfast part.  Went there on a Friday night and got to say this is a step down from all the other clubs right around the corner.  It was a birthday party so we got a table.  Well they put us at a table that is literally 5 feet from the bar so we had strangers sitting on are couches and constantly walking through our group.  We asked to be move and they said no.  Several of us offered to pay more money to move but again they said no.  Not sure if the other booths were reserved but the place they put us really shouldn't count as a table.  There was no dress code and the people there all looked like they rolled out of bed and put the first thing they could find on the floor.  The music sucked it was wannabe house music I guess. After 30 minutes majority of our group left."}
{"text":"I don't drink but they are out of every alcohol possible. Who don't have red bull?!?!"}
{"text":"We bought the groupon based on the reviews....talk about a disappointment. 

No bloodies, no breakfast, bad service, disheveled place, and one football game even though they claimed to have the ticket. \"The lady that ran the bloody bar moved\". Strike one. \"We no longer serve breakfast.\" Strike two. We sat at the bar which had food crusted to it, tried to move a seat down at the bar but there were stains dried to the bar stool. Moved to a table which looked like it hadn't been wiped down in a week. Strike three. We were delivered food we didn't order. We asked for a specific game to be put on which resulted in 20 minutes of confusion, one tv turned off and the wrong game put on. 

The only silver lining was the fries. I wish it were still American junkie, we will never go back or recommend it."}
{"text":"These guys have no clue on timeliness. I just wasted an hour and 15 minutes without food, and they got my order wrong. No apologies, nothing! Would be more appropriate to give them a ZERO."}
{"text":"I'm not big on nightlife, but I had an awesome time at Urbane Manner. Came through here with Scottsdale Nights. What a total blast! DJ NIGHTMARE was off the hook. I love the spacious design and how the A/C is non-stop blasting. I brought a sweat rag and only used it once at the end of the night. The best part of my experience though was Alicia. She always made sure I was smiling and that I had a drink in my hand. I'm certified in customer satisfaction and Alicia has VERY excellent customer service in my book, big thank you to her. Big thanks to Scottsdale Nights for bringing us all out here. This place is great and on a roll, 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Permanently closed and abandoned. I visited twice during business hours. All the lights are out and all the tables are missing from the restaurant. The place looks completely abandoned inside. The phone is never answered by anyone and the website is down. Do not buy the Groupon for this place."}
{"text":"Urbane manner is great! Good was amazing! We tried the huevos rancheros, chicken fried chicken, and a small stack of pancakes. Everything is made in house and from scratch. The pancakes were AMAZING!! They also have a mimosa and Bloody Mary bar that you can make your own way. We were lucky to have a sample of the French toast as well and we loved it! If you like great made from scratch food with lots of flavor this is definitely a place you need to try."}
{"text":"Came on Saturday @ 10:30pm, nobody here. Like no patrons and no bartenders. Had to wait for bartender. Who waits for a bartender at an empty bar?

I am not sure if there are better nights to come but I was oddly surprised that there was literally nobody here at 10:30pm on Saturday.

With that said, if nobody is there then there isn't a need to blast the music. Sure I understand that you might turn it up to let people know you're open, but man... It was deafening. I had you literally lean over and scream at the top of my lungs (and even then I couldn't even hear myself!). I've been at plenty of bars/clubs where there were tons of people and the music was a fraction of the volume. I went outside and still, very loud. And I file this complaint with the notion that I love loud music!"}
{"text":"Love the menu!!!!!! I was a big fan of BRKFST, but this food is out of this world. Great atmosphere and awesome servers make this place perfect. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here last weekend with the bf. Points for dog-friendly patio, awesome service, friendly wait staff, aaaaand food:

bf had the caesar salad which he said was pretty standard, nothing special. I had the pork green chile tacos with an over-easy egg and added a side of rice per the waitresses suggestion. SOOOOO GOOD!!!!! This was seriously amazing. Very flavorful and just the right amount of spice. The rice was also awesome to sop up all of the juices from the chile bowl. I was basically in a food coma the rest of the day 

Back on a smaller, less traveled road, so pretty quiet. Also has pretty cool bike racks outside"}
{"text":"Went here for a Halloween Eve block party and it was pretty good. There was an EDM stage outside and inside this place became a club. The DJ played a mix of EDM and hip hop. There was a decently sized dance floor which was great. There wasn't free seating so VIP only couches. There was a patio so that was nice if you needed a breather from dancing. The bathrooms for the most part were taken care of and weren't too terrible. Overall it was a fair and good experience."}
{"text":"Great bartender...made us laugh and really made the experience fun!  We enjoyed some beer/cider while watching some football on a Saturday afternoon.  Looks like it could be a fun, lively place on a Friday/Saturday night and they serve up some pretty amazing cocktails too!"}
{"text":"If you come here you MUST have the chicken and waffles and/or the Biscuits and Gravy. Unbelievable menu and smooth atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is great, fresh concept in the heart of a thriving nightlife scene. Not to mention one of the best brunches I have had the pleasure of tasting. Their staff is top notch and service impeccable. I will definitely be a regular here for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles were so good but needed twice the amount of chicken! Pancakes were amazing!! Overall great menu. This place is going to get so busy once and the apartments are done being built across the street. We will be regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"The best place to eat in old town ! the drink menu is amazing. I recommend trying the Bloody Mary bar. It was my first time having a Bloody Mary, and its now my favorite drink. They provide so many different selections to really provide variety to each individual customer. As soon as I walked in I was greeted, asked how how I was doing, all that great stuff. Our server gave us recommendations on what we should try. She was very patient and never stopped smiling. Loved the whole atmosphere, very loungey. The new look is very sophisticated. Love this place !"}
{"text":"Drinks were strong and cheap.
Music was amazing.
Staff was friendly.
No one was in there, which in my opinion, is a breath of fresh-air compared to the packed clubs you typically see in Old Town.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch-  it was during the week... we were the only ones there.  Server was very friendly and everything we had was excellent.  I had the Korean chicken and waffles as my main dish.  I am Korean, so I always love to try everyone's different interpretation of the flavors.  Sometimes it's way off, but I have to say... these were on point.  I could def taste the red chili pepper and it gave it a nice kick."}
{"text":"This is the former BRKFST ( so you can see my review for that establishment and it is pretty much the same). After going to BRKFST with the breakfast club UYE and liking it (and then waiting a month for them to remodel and change their name), I came back to the newly branded Urbane with my mom for brunch. Luckily, the menu was mostly the same. I got to have the loco moco again (and they corrected their menu so the dish matches what is described on the menu, so that's good). Again, it was a large and tasty dish of food (and special because I can't think of anywhere else in town that serves this). The only downside was my egg was overcooked, but I sent it back and they promptly made me a new egg. My mom got the French toast, which was extra fried and delish served with a bourbon syrup. One of the people who was involved in the rebranding spent a good amount of time talking to us and telling us about their food, which was a nice touch. They have also implemented a bloody mary/mimosa bar, which looked extensive with a wide variety of fruits, veg, and other items to make your drink more interesting. Our breakfast was around 20$ so fairly standard as compared to other eateries. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Definitely a positive brunch experience! Huevos rancheros were savory and full-flavored, but not a huge portion (which I prefer). The mimosa bar exceeded my expectations- it had orange juice and/or strawberry juice for mixing, as well as raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, and blue berries to add an elegant feel to your mimosa! The dining area was open and uncluttered and the exposed brick allowed for a modern, yet rustic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very friendly and accommodating service. Waiters, waitresses and guests are all beautiful people. Bloody Marys are stellar, burgers are juicy and original. Good vibes."}
{"text":"Very contemporary restaurant 

The Cucumber Ice Water was not received well, just not a fan of the combination of cucumber taste with water.

We shared a few dishes - Korean Chicken and Waffles, Loco Moco, Waffles, Cartel Ice Coffee and Carmel Ice Coffee.

The food was excellent, the Korean Chicken and Waffles was a different combination of taste but they pulled it off. The Loco Moco was probably the best dish and good combination similar to being in Hawaii.

Waitress was exceptional.

Will come back and try a few other dishes next time"}
