{"text":"This place is sooo good..you can get a massive plate of shawarma for $9 all in.  The chicken shawarma is super tender and juicy.  I'm definitely returning here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Been a few times and always been satified to the point of telling other people. The food tastes great, the portions are large, you get great bang for your buck, and the staff is always friendly! I don't know what more you ask for!"}
{"text":"Shawarma wrap is good and the staff super friendly. 

They take credit with a $0.50 fee. Still very reasonably priced overall!"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price, I come here all the time for lunch, they always give me free falafels alongside very generous portions, as specially with respect to the actual quality of the food.  You can come here with 5 dollars on any given day and leave full as can be.  Great place, would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I am a self proclaimed connoisseur of middle Eastern cuisine - its def my go to food.  I've wandered by this place at Bloor and Christie many times - it seemed outnumbered by all the Korean joints in the area, so I decided to check the Yelp reviews.  To my amazement everyone gave it 5 stars except for 1 outlier.  
Came back determined to try the shawarma, and was not disappointed.
The proprietor of this fine neighbourhood gem gave me a platter of food that would easily feed two - but I ATE IT ALL.  I don't eat carbs so I nixed the rice and had the tabouli.  It was absolutely delicious!  Most places drown the tabouli in oil so it gets nasty and soggy and very often they don't wash the parsley thoroughly so you end up with a mouthful of sand.  
This stuff was so unbelievably fresh and with just a dash of lemon juice it was perfect!  To my extreme shock, this cost $7.99 and even with a drink was only 10 bucks.  I tipped generously cos it was so insanely good!
Will now find excuses to go to Bloor/Christie more often. :D"}
{"text":"Nothing special, I ordered a chicken shawarma plate. It was good portion and amazing prices ."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack. I ordered a falafel plate with 2 samosas. This is the best falafel I ever had! I strongly recommend it. Prices are very affordable. The owner is an amazing person. Overall great experience. I strongly recommend this place to anyone craving middle eastern food."}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food I have eaten and to make matters even better - it's cheap!"}
{"text":"The food was good... however I think what gave this place a high rating was both service and price. We only paid less than $9 for an entire chicken shwarma plate, which is literally unheard of. Plus the guy serving us was super nice and really took his time with serving our plate. It wasn't the best tasting shwarma plate I've had...but I do think because of the price it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Came here to grab some falafels? and samosas. This place open late which makes it a nice go to at late night after clubbing. The food is great loved it and price is reasonable. The staff is very friendly and the theme of the place is middle Eastern which is great as the food. Will definitely come back and recommend the place for friends."}
{"text":"I dropped in late afternoon, it is a small place with only a few seats, but there was a steady stream of people coming in for take out, and a few people eating in. I had a plate with beef and chicken and all the fixings. The owner was working, he is a very pleasant cheerful man, was joking around with customers and making sure everyone got exactly what they wanted. It's always nice to see someone who cares so much about his food AND his customers. The food was great, I got a bit of everything, and it was all very good, eaten individually, some of it could have used more flavour, but when put together, it really didn't need anything else added to it. Service was very quick as it should be for a take out type place, and the prices are very good. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"THE.Best.FALAFEL. I have ever had!! amazing customer service, incredible value and portion size!"}
{"text":"Unlike other reviewers, I wasn't amazed with their shawarma. The chicken tasted okay but was bland compared to the previous ones I've had in other places. The salad was all soaked in water which made the wrap watery; not a feature you would like in your sandwich. I could distinguish some exotic spices in some toppings but overall, I wouldn't give more than 3stars (being my generous self at midnight after a concert). 

The staff was nice and the place looked very clean. 
They accept credit card. They are open till late. They have a few tables for groups."}
{"text":"Falafel sandwich is by far the best! the place gets packed quickly so be prepared to get take out!

So me and a friend stumbled onto this place while hanging out in the Christie Pits area. Figuring we'd grab a quick falafel. We walked in and the place was small, with a few tables that were pretty much occupied. We placed our order and were lucky enough to have a group of students exit so we could sit. 

The falafel was freshly friend and tasted amazing! We were even given an extra falafel and rice for the little one we had with us! I was excited to go back and try the chicken shawarma , which i did about a week later. Totally worth it. 

If you are ever in the Christie and Bloor area, totally worth trying!"}
{"text":"Sooooo, I hate giving bad reviews to small businesses, but I'll try to be as nice as possible because the employee working, possibly the owner, did a great job accommodating us. We were a big group of 16 people and yes, we fit in that little restaurant. We were able to get our food in a good amount of time even though there was just one person making the food. 
I'll give the place 4 stars for the taste of the food. Food wasn't bad, it was actually pretty good. The reason why I wasn't that happy with the place was due to the lack of cleanliness. I am visiting from the states and what I saw would never be allowed. Sorry, call me boujee, but the place was just a little too 'hole in the wall'. We ate, but we were a little grossed out. We chose this restaurant because we needed halal food and we were in that area. It's not very family friendly. From the reviews, it seems as a place where people come to after the clubs and bars. It's just not a place to bring the grandparents and kids. That's all."}
