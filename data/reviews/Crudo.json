{"text":"In town from San Francisco for work and find this place on yelp. Food was awesome and service was fantastic! :-)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  It's a bit expensive, but the food is delicious - fresh and unique.  I'm looking forward to going back, though at the price it'll be more of a special-occasion excursion."}
{"text":"Great service from Francis.  Great wine recommendation from her.   Food and environment was great.   A must!"}
{"text":"Great bar and amazing atmosphere. Food is definitely worth trying. Perfect date spot."}
{"text":"I can't believe anyone can say the food at this place is good. It's awful!!! Complete fail. Just because you have a bunch of fancy sounding courses or interesting pairings, it doesn't equate to tasting good or having quality. The waiter decided to give me a lesson on wine, and claimed that California Pinot Noir couldn't hold a candle to Bordeaux, so he couldn't recommend a Pinot Noir for the table. What a joke. This place is clearly trendy, and I think that alone is why people go. Just because you have items on the menu that might appear in an Italian restaurant, it doesn't mean you are an Italian restaurant. It's laughable that they claim to be Italian. What the hell is \"modern Italian\"? I've dined in multiple regions in Italy, and I have never experienced anything like Crudo. My wife and I will never go again."}
{"text":"One of Phoenix's best dining spots.  The tuna and the risotto are world class dishes."}
{"text":"I have to say this is my best Arizona Restaurant Week experience. The food, design, environment are all really good. Suggest to come in around 6pm and choose the table near window, which have a kind of private small hall for 6 people. I would suggest this restaurant to any friend who like to try Italian food with a nice environment and pleasant experience. 

Sides:
Crispy pig ears: I will definitely recommend it. Sour from white vinegar. Crispy but not oily from stripped fried pig ears. Spicy from red sliced pepper. The end, add some chopped green onion on the top. A nice starter. 5
Creamy Polenta: creamy taste, not sweet or salty. The cornmeal tastes friendly to Chinese, for we also eat a lot in the north part of China. 3.5

First course: Crudo
Albacore with green apples green apples, black garlic and truffle oil: peak color fish with tender texture. You can definitely small the truffle oil, wonderful taste. 4.5
Butterfish with tomato arugula: although some people feel butterfish should not consider to be a fish, but I like its texture - sticky to teethes. Sweet, salty and rich. 4
Local seasonal lettuces and veggies with house made vinaigrette: Fresh feeling, nothing that impressive3
Fresh Mozzarella with olive oil poached tomatoes: first time to try Mozzarella, interesting feeling, soft, tender and light. Nice combination gives different layers of feeling.3.5

Second course:
Riotto with Squid Ink, Tomatoes and Tuna: one of my favorites. Dark soup with risotto to absorb all flavors, combining with some chili pepper to give the overall rich and smooth feeling some exciting spikes. 5
Gnocchi A La Testa Pork Rapini: the bitter rapini does taste like a Chinese vegetable Chinese Kai-lan. Gnocchi is also very familiar to me.3.5
Short Rib with crisp potatoes and truffle vinaigrette: the meat on the rib is really tasty. Tender, sticky, sweet and salty. Truffle gives a more pleasant smell.4.5
Butterfish with roasted carrot and Salsa Verde and polenta: the white fish combine with green sauce gives a nice picture. Salsa Verde contains parsley, vinegar, capers, garlic, onion, anchovies and olive oil. Most of its flavor is from parsley. 3.5

Third course: dessert by Tracy Dempsey
Olive oil cake with berry compote and ricotta:good but not impressive 3
Salted orange caramel and chocolate Budino: very tasty, smooth, creamy and rich.4"}
{"text":"Pigs ears are delicious - who knew? More on this in a minute.

Sadly, I've never been here for dinner. I've dropped in a number of times after dinner for a drink and to talk with friends and Crudo never disappoints.

They have an extensive list of unique drinks written on a large chalkboard. Do Not, I repeat, Do Not, just order something boring like a beer or a glass of wine. OK, you can but you'll be missing out.  A personal favorite is the 1951 (bourbon, amaro, grapefruit cinnamon syrup and bitters). Tasty!

OK, the pig ears. Two words - order them. These are fried pig ears with pickled chilis and onions. No, it doesn't sound good but you will love it. You're just going to have to trust me and almost everyone else sitting here."}
{"text":"I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location.  And I raved about it and vowed to come back (although the strange location in a salon delayed that return).  Then Crudo disappeared.  And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies.  Now it has reappeared, and in a better location.  Oh joy."}
{"text":"Tried Crudo during restaurant week. It is housed in an old space familiar from many years ago. Updated with concrete floor, exposed ceilings. Friendly staff, quick service. Wine glasses are stemless, which is too bad. Tables are pieced wood tops that do not work with decor. Food was good, but not great, except first course;raw fish and apple slivers. Short rib, gnocci entree was good, but not outstanding. Dessert was just so-so, even though I buy her desserts at Whole Foods.  The water is undrinkable-please filter it!! . We are foodies and familiar with restaurant scene, so were happy to find this in a close in location. May return for a second try, but with the competition, may not. In all fairness, the other entrees may be exceptional, but our experience was mediocre over all. Portions small, and the need to turn tables was apparent. Bus boys need more training-served from wrong side and took plates away too quickly. I'm not nit-picking, but trying to give the complete experience, not just the food."}
{"text":"This was an excellent restaurant. Very unique with their food choices, but delicious none the less. Look for to coming back outside of Resturant week!"}
{"text":"We dined at Crudo for first time last night.
We have lived here for 17 years and have found no match to this culinary experience.
The service and food were outstanding!!"}
{"text":"The mushrooms au gratin and the rolled veal breast is excellent!  The chef is a magician!  I wouldn't say no to anything he makes!"}
{"text":"Before I get into this review, I want to say the food was very good. My problem was not the food. First of all the chairs at the bar were terrible, very uncomfortable. The water is undrinkable, don't even attempt to drink it, order bottle water. The smell in the restaurant was so bad that it gave a headache, when I got home left my clothes on my patio because of the smell, and couldn't wait to jump in shower. Also make sure you don't order the tap wines, I was very surprised I ordered a 42.00 bottle of Copain Pinot noir and it did not come in the bottle, it came in a carafe, I was very surprised at that, waitress said it was tap wine which was never mentioned on the menu. So again the food was very good. If they can at least correct smell I will go back.

{"text":"this place is great! everything is fresh and since they moved to the new location we have really enjoyed the bar area for a quick bite. One of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Super cute place. The smoked olives are amazing. Also loved the pigs ears (seriously!). Service was great. We will be back often."}
{"text":"The location: -2 stars. The restaurant is TINY, and located within a gift shop. That being said, the food: 7 stars. Almost every dish had perfectly-balanced flavors, and each was new, exciting, and utterly delicious. I'm afraid \"fantastic\"  doesn't begin to describe the flavor profile and depth of ingredients. The farm salad, in particular, was so good it left me speechless. And as an added benefit, the service is impeccable. Both the waitress and the chef went out of their way to make our experience amazing - and I am glad to report that they succeeded."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is a must.  Get here before 7pm. Entrance is in the back.   The items ( non happy hour ) are a little pricey. But that being said, everything we had was AMAZING.
Now it's very dark in the bar area, and I thought the menu was a little hard to decipher for a first timer.   Once the waiter explained what the different sections of the menu were I was with the program.  So everything on one side of the menu is small items. Like small bites or app. fare. The other side (right side ) are entree sized items.
We had Yellowtail from the Crudo or raw small left side and Butternut squash and pork dumpling from the entree side.  The Yellowtail was fab. and as good as any sashimi I have had. There are spices on it so I guess not technically sashimi, but the fish was of that grade.  The dumpling was not what I expected, not crescent shaped pieces of dough with filling. More like a big \"meatball\" with dough around it. Regardless, it was delicious ! We were practically fighting over the last bits.  Def a must return and eat more of the menu place.  Would love to bring more friends here so we could try more items !"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix. They have great cocktails and I dream about the salmon at least once a week.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgable about the menu. I always bring out of town friends to crudo and they are always happy!"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic. Not a huge menu, but it is quite diverse with both raw fish and traditional Italian cuisine. 

You can order each item as an entree or combine several (3 for $30, 4 for $40...yes, you get the idea). My date and I ordered three each, and the chef prepared them one at a time, allowing us to enjoy each dish. It really gave us an opportunity to eat at casual pace without the tastes of each dish interfering with one another. 

The veal and the risotto were phenomenal!

Not a big desert connoisseur, but if available, try the cake soaked in olive oil.  Great ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"Let me explain...the food is great and first two times we were there were great, but the third time was not a charm. We walked in on a Friday  night for happy hour - very hip crowd, busy but not crazy.  My husband and sat at a table for 10 minutes while servers kept walking past us without any acknowledgement. Even the hostess was too busy to look up from her computer when we walked in.  We walked out and went to the Nook where we were greeted when we walked in and it was clear our patronage was appreciated."}
{"text":"Drinks and our first two courses were excellent!!! My entree was a fish that was ultra fishy...couldn't eat it.  That being said, the other portions were great, the staff was great...and we would likely go again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  This restaurant has a great menu.  I really like the freedom to choose your own tasting menu of 3, 4 or 5 courses.  The pricing for the tasting menus are reasonable and they do not skimp on the portions.  I was stuffed with 3.5 courses (friend and I shared a 3 course and 4 course).  Notable dishes: butterfish crudo, squid ink risotto, pork belly, tempura escargot (the day's special).  Everything tasted good.  Good cocktail choices, although friend did not think they were strong enough.  The dining room, despite being a bit bare, was still comfortable and elegant.  Sound level was just right - you feel the crowd but can still hear the other party."}
{"text":"Crudo is two completely different concepts depending on when you go but the cooking is top-notch no matter when. The food is lovingly made in a tiny kitchen in a hair salon (yes, hair salon) by two experienced and talented chefs - Cullen and Brandon. No sous chefs, no line cooks - these two former exec chefs do it all - from french toast in the morning to salads and sandwiches to lunch to the some of the most sophisticated food I've ever had in the US in the evening.

The gift shop setting is a bit unusual but the customer benefits in a huge way. By not being beholden to investors and sky high Old Town Scottsdale rent, the chefs are able to deliver 6-star food that they're truly passionate about at super reasonable prices for dinner.

There is a serious lack of creativity and daring in most of the Valley but not at Crudo where it's done with sophistication. Crudo can be described as new-style sashimi - raw fish dressed lightly with some kind of oil and acid and garnished with tasty herbs, fruit or even black truffle shavings - giving the diner a delightful spectrum of flavors and textures. One of my favorites so far is albacore topped with crunchy strips of tart apple, intensely flavored black garlic and black truffle. 

The freshness and quality of their raw fish surpasses most sushi restaurants in the Valley. I loved the madai red snapper they sourced in an auction from the best seafood market in the world - Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market. The fish changes weekly depending on the auction. Crudo is all about cooking in the season and local ingredients. I love the salad bar at lunch and seasonal vegetable crudo at dinner both using top notch produce from Maya's Farm. Personally I find salad bars in most places boring but here you find delicious atypical vegetables like crunchy purslane, sea beans, ramps and fennel fronds, which I had to fight other people for at NYC's Union Sq Farmers' Market.

Crudo is one of the most exciting restaurants in the Valley right now and at $30 for 3 savory courses, I plan to be there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Very disappointed last night.    Food yummy, service MIA.   Sat at table 6:30, one other table occupied.  1 course wine and bread 7:30..... expressed concern to waitress.  Only 2 courses by 8...... no attention, she was in hiding, flagged her down to check out.    She presented us a ridiculous bill, two singles glasses wine, she charged bottle plus individual item prices (not two thirds of a thirty dollar set price).  

I asked for manager.... he apologized but said he was off duty and didn't know our prob.    He asked us not to post.... only reason I am posting.  Minor adjustment to bill...... after 8 - 10 great experiences my expectations lowered.  Used to recommend once a week to cohorts.   It appears they are in crash mode.  Light night, nobody on first, everybody running scared."}
{"text":"Why did I move away from Arizona? I wake up every day to that question. Thanks a lot Crudo! (super sarcastic voice) I started this account 2 years ago and said I would only review when I absolutely HAD to let the world know...

I will not go into each dish as my fellow reviewers have, because as a semi-pro foodie, I dare you to find anything on the menu you won't like. In fact, you may walk away in love, as I did on my first visit to Crudo. 2 words: Pork Belly. Well ok, more than 2 words... Pig Ears, Smoked Olives, Barratta, Squid Ink Risotto... do yourself a favor.

But it wasn't just the new taste sensations I was encountering that evening that sets Crudo apart, it was the complete dining experience.

Service- Amazing. Informative. Charming.
Ambiance- Perfect. Great lighting/decor. Best restaurant playlist... Ever. (Take your Shazam app).

I can't wait to come back to AZ and stop by my new fav... Bravo Crudo!"}
{"text":"I went with three friends to Crudo last Saturday to try it out since it had good reviews on here and was featured in Phoenix magazine.  It is unique in that it has an outdoor patio area but the indoor seating looks more like a 1950's ice cream shop with a store located in it.  Most of the diners including us sat outside.  

My friends and I all chose to have 3 courses since we knew the plates were small and we wanted dessert to be one of our courses.  My first plate was of Gnocchi, which was very good.  My second course was the mushrooms au gratin with featured truffle mushrooms which are generally a very expensive ingredient.  It also had an egg on top which made it very unique. The egg portion wasn't featured on the menu but our server told me about it beforehand.    The dessert was my favorite part.  :-)  For dessert I ordered a grilled polenta with cornbread icecream and a great rhubarb jam on top.  The grilled polenta reminded me of a shortbread cookie.  I was hesitant to try corn as a dessert flavor, but it turned out sweet and not too overpowering.  

I made a reservation not knowing how crowded it would be.  The restaurant was full but there was not a wait to sit, even without a reservation.  Still if you plan to go here I would suggest making a reservation.  

My one dislike about this place was that it did take a while for the service and food to arrive.  If you want to go here for dinner on the weekend you should plan to take about 2 hours to eat a three course meal.

Overall this was a great traditional Italian restaurant that I would recommend trying!"}
{"text":"Have been back 2 more times since my first review and Crudo has never missed a beat! Love, luhv, luv hanging out on the patio with Cullen, Bubba and Dina under the stars with great wine and even better company!

Last two times I have had the 3 course crudo deal and have found shear genius in all of the plates! So much food with fantastic, clever combinations and please do not miss the fish crudos, especially those that come in fresh from the Japanese fish market! 

Really a gem in So Sco that should not be missed! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the vast Scottsdale culinary wasteland.   This is one of those places that exists because the chefs have a passion for food and not because they are looking to get rich.  We visited twice last week and had wonderful homemade gnocchi, unique mussels sourced from California, octopus from Tokyo and a variety of gourmet mushrooms from Flagstaff.  Need one say more?  This is not a place to visit if you're looking for a scene, or a romantic venue.  However, it is a must for real foodies.   Just go."}
{"text":"Sometime I look in Andrews eyes, I don't  a word, and he brings me the perfect craft cocktail. These kinds of occurrences shape me in the human I am today. The human that has an empty iced coffee from 4 weeks ago still in my fridge."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.  The squid ink risotto, the short rib, the brunch...everything!   Sooooooo good!"}
{"text":"I have to echo all of the other praise about Crudo, great food, great ambiance, and great service.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really unique combinations of food. It is essentially Italian sushi. SOO good though. I recommend the squid-ink risotto and crispy pig ears. Also, the Rebel's Son is a delicious cocktail. The only downside to this place is I thought it felt a bit lofty and empty. They are going for the minimal look but it feels a bit bare to me. I am sure they will figure it out in time. They are fairly new-ish."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a last min. diner and we were truly delighted by the quality and presentation of the food.  Everything was fresh and the attention to detail was noted.  However I can't give them 5 starts.  It sounds trivial, but they do not have \"proper\" coffee!  The only coffee they were able to serve was a drip coffee.  Being an Italian establishment I would assume that coffee is one of those important details.  At the end of such a wonderful night we were hoping for a good Italian espresso with our dessert.  Unfortunately we were presented with a super chocolaty sweet and a bad coffee taste in our mouths that we were unable to drink.  Our server was wonderful and explained how they put their budget for a proper coffee machine elsewhere.... it is only my opinion, but many people end their evening with coffee and that is the last impressions many will have.  Crudo should invest simply in a small machine for now and hid it from the guests if they wish to wait for a grand espresso machine to put on display.  It is a small detail, but one with merit.  We will go back, but unfortunately we will go else where for coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"One of the best in town. Always a favorite place to go when I remember it is there haha! Drinks and food are top notch. Has brunch here recently... The brisket and beets is one of the most amazing things I have ever put it in my mouth. 

Food: A+
Drinks: A+
Service: A
Ambiance:B+"}
{"text":"Oh shoot!  This place is legit.  Had dinner here with a friend two nights ago and all I can say is WOW.  We started off with the Crispy Pig Ears and they were great.  Crunchy and flavorful with an amazing sauce.  The spicy peppers added a great little kick.  These can easily be picked off if you're not into heat.  I chose the 3 course option and ordered the Brisket, Semolina Gnocchi and Albacore.  Every single dish was amazing.  I'm not one to go into full detail about the garnishes and how the different flavors complimented one another blah blah.  Let's just stick with.....Crudo is pretty damn good.  But the Bourbon on the rocks I was drinking did, however, compliment the dishes very well."}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant on a travel show, so decided to call a couple days ahead and order the entire pigs head. Delicious, succulent meat. Not to mention the beef brisket with bone marrow, to die for. Great service, delicious cocktails. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Bar Crudo is FABULOUS!!!!!!! We are from NYC and have been having trouble finding restaurants that are consistently good. Bar Crudo is consistently GREAT!!!!!!! The food is original and as fresh as can be! We have been there five times and it just keeps getting better!!!! I'm so thankful to have a NYC quality restaurant right here in Phoenix!!!!!  WE LOVE CRUDO!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place in the valley. Great for valentine's day as it wasn't very crowded last year.  Brought foodies from LA and they came away very impressed!!!

A fun, funky hip vibe.....   fun inventive cocktails!

Bacon truffle popcorn a bit disappointing...  have thoroughly enjoyed all of the cheese and crudo courses."}
{"text":"Worth the money. Special evening with my wife, she loved it. Started in the bar, told the bartender what I normally drink, he made something unique but similar. Very tasty.
  The food was great, the service was awesome. Will come here anytime."}
{"text":"We ordered the Mussels tomato pasta dish 12/3/16. The mussels didn't not taste fresh,(I'm from the east coast and we know our seafood) pasta was over cooked and the sauce was lacking taste of any kind. The meal was $22. Very disappointed. Our friends ordered another pasta dish with an egg on it, same thing. The pasta was over cooked and lacking flavor again. The lamb entree dish was ok. The small apps tasted better. Wait staffwas friendly and we didn't have to pay for the mussels pasta dish but the food is definitely over priced for what you get. Don't think we will go back again. Over rated place for sure. We tried 3 different entrees and all were fair too poor unfortunately."}
{"text":"Not your typical fine dining cuisine.  I had the pig ears, squid ink and pork belly and they were unbelievably delicious.  The chef has done a masterful job with the flavor and creativity. They also have a large selection of wine and drinks which are surprisingly priced moderately compared to the food.   It was a challenge finding the restaurant as it is located in the back of the plaza.  Sitting is very limited so I would  recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"On a quest to see what the Phoenix New Times Best of list was all about this was our first stop.. Best Margarita. It is not this fancy schmancy craft combination that gives this drink the best of but perhaps its simplicity. This margarita allows you to appreciate the true essence of an agave spirit, Tequila. With only two other simple ingredients I would say this margarita was top notch. We stayed for dinner and boy am I happy we did. The bartenders, Lauren and Brenon, were artful, creative, passionate and the true meaning of mixologists and hospitality extraordinaires. We did a coursed menu which included burrata with a pancetta vinaigrette, ahi crudo with a horse radish drizzle, lamb neck gnocchi and pork belly. This was a culinary experience that takes you on an palatable adventure craving for the next fix. I would recommend this place to anyone but especially those of you that want to challenge your pallet with something more!"}
{"text":"The bar is sweet. Great food. Mozzarella was very tasty. Great drinks. Mixology at it's finest. Good tunes. Coming back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Strange location with just enough ambiance to feel like it's worth the prices. Our server was knowledgable and friendly though she could have been a bit more proactive in making recommendations to some people who were clearly in over their head. I loved everything I had but the pork belly and crispy pig's ears stand out as clear favorites. I wish I was rich so that I could dine here regularly!"}
{"text":"Diners that appreciate the freshest ingredients combined for unique flavor experiences won't be disappointed at Crudo. I have eaten here a dozen times and have enjoyed a dozen great meals. We usually order a combination 8 to 9 items from the three main  catagories (not including deserts) for four of us and share. I have recommended Crudo to several friends and family members and at least two of them have declared it's their new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this restaurant. First of all, they say it's Italian but it really isn't. They will use some things that get in Italian restaurants but the do it in a different way but don't expect to get meatballs. Also, never had raw fish in an Italian restaurant.

That being said, the food is really good. A friend and I both did the 3 course meals where you can pick almost anything of the menu as one of your the items. I highly recommend doing this and sharing so you can try more things.

We started with the crispy pig ears (not part of the 3 course items). Very good with a fatty taste to them with a sweeter sauce that real adds to them. Our first course was the albacore which was pretty good and very fresh. We also had the brutta (cheese section) that was also very good. Only complaint is that there wasn't enough bread for the amount of cheese, but we probably could have asked for more but didn't.

We then went to the risotto. I highly recommend this one as it was one of the best plates. Don't let the blackness of it (squid ink) stop you from eating it because it really was amazing. With it came the semolina gnocchi which was very good. Make sure to scoop up the sauce and pork jowl from under it with the gnocchi which really makes the plate.

We then got the short rib and add the bone marrow. The short rib by itself was really good, but with the bone marrow it went to another level. This was up there with the risotto as the best of the night.

Then came the yellowtail collar. So there is a lot of bone there with not as much meat which was somewhat of a bummer because it was pretty darn good. The fish just melted in your mouth. 

This is where we made a mistake. Use one of the courses (1/6 course with two people) for dessert. There will be enough with the other five choices. We went with the casata, I think it was called. They changed the menu so I couldn't look it up. It's the first option. It was a pastry with apricot that was really good. Came with a scoop of gelato on top. 

The staff was very good. The cocktails were also good but this is getting long enough. I would recommend checking this place out.

P.S. Sorry for the bad pictures."}
{"text":"Location - Interesting that this restaurant shared a space with a junky gift shop. Their signage was very small and rested on a brick wall to the entrance. Ambiance FAIL.

Food - The mushroom with truffle was fantastic. The beet salad was very interesting. The fingerlings anyone could have fixed. All portions were very small. 

Over priced!

Service - There were only two other parties. The chefs visited those tables, but not mine. When I gave the server a Restaurant.com gift certificate she was very rude with no \"Thank you\". 

I would not come here again for mediocre service and 1/3 dishes being good."}
{"text":"Ok, we went there 3 times already. The food is always great, we love the bar area, and the extremelly friendly/knowledgeable bartenders. We went the first time for restaurant week, and thought it was great and cheap; so we went back for polenta board Wednesday. We loved it, even though we ordered one polenta board for two and a tasting menu (way too much food, the server warned us). We went back not long ago for another polenta board, and it was again very good. Salad, polenta board and a bottle of wine for $40, hard to beat in Phoenix. It was our anniversary, and they kindly brought 2 flutes, thank you, very nice and highly appreciated. So why 4 stars? Well, still it is not the warmest place, something is missing, the noise level, an atmosphere, a smile, a feeling of \"welcome\". We will still go back, but it belongs to those place you go for the food,  just the food and the bar. Maybe next time we will eat at the bar."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed if you try anything at Crudo with your smoked olives. We are currently enjoying the Scapetta Rose."}
{"text":"So, so delicious.  Excellent food, outstanding service, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and enjoyed several handcrafted cocktails that did not disappoint.  The squid ink risotto, prawns, and butterfish were divine.  The décor is lovely and the food is memorable. Crudo is a must try."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday and ordered the roast pig's head. Amazing!!! The sides were fantastic, service was great, and we had a really incredible night. :D"}
{"text":"Hosted a party of five. Waiter was knowledgable, amenable and friendly. He paced our courses perfectly. Food was superb and properly presented. Outstanding"}
{"text":"It begins with a great cocktail and ends with salted caramel. 
The bartenders have some unique variations of favorite cocktails that provide a perfect refreshment for the hot Phoenix sun. Artisanal cocktails are rare as snow in July in Phoenix and this place has them. Perfectly balanced bitters, liquors, and herbs. 
The dinners provide variations of taste for any- from those who want fresh and light with tuna to a heavier short rib. But the squid ink risotto makes an atheist believe in a higher power. Tart, tangy and rich the balance in the risotto is rarely achieved today. 
Desert- just do it"}
{"text":"We had heard great things about Crudo's brunch and made a reservation for Easter. I wasn't sure what to expect since the restaurant is in a shopping center off of Indian School but you would have no idea once you step inside. The atmosphere is bright, airy, and almost feels exclusive. But more importantly, the food lived up to the hype. Each ingredient used was purposeful and each bite left you wanting more. We're excited to check out their dinner menu next!"}
{"text":"I carefully read through so many reviews before choosing to try Crudo.   I find that I disagree with most of them.  The best thing about the entire evening was the mosaic created on a wall with old painted window shutters.  We started with the albacore for an appetizer.  Delicious but severely overpriced.  I get that it is an appetizer so it does not need to be a substantial serving, but if I am going to be served less than half an ounce, don't charge me $12.  Also, the garnishes were lovely but so tiny that it wasn't really possible to enjoy any flavor.  My main dish was the brisket. . . . I have created more flavorful versions in my crockpot.   It was extremely fatty. . . Enough so that I had keep surreptitiously slipping bits of fat out of my mouth to set aside in the plate.  The polenta was tasteless.  Actually, polenta is pretty much always tasteless.  It is what you do with it that can make it a pleasure to consume.  They did nothing with it.  Think mush.  I left very hungry. My companion had the squid ink risotto.  He enjoyed it but said he has had much better.  I tasted it and found it had too much heat for the delicate flavors it was combined with.  If I had originally chosen to have the three course meals ($35) or the four course ($45), I probably would have complained about what I got for my money.  It was seriously disappointing.  All smoke and mirrors, and not enough substance.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG!!! I'm somewhat hesitant to write how good this place is because I want to keep it to myself. My husband and I eat out 2-3 times per week and have eaten at just about every decent restaurant in the valley. This place takes the cake! Seriously... my new favorite place to eat... PERIOD! The service is amazing, the food is to die for. Everything is just perfect! The Yellowtail was so good it almost made me cry. If you want amazing food that is a totally different take the on the traditional Italian places, book a reservation STAT. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last week and the food was amazing.  Ordered the three course meal and loved everything.  The bartender mixed up a surprise drink and I was not disappointed.  I would recommend Crudo to anyone who loves great food."}
{"text":"Crude O is more like it. They were out of the three things i wanted of course and it is in a weird salon type place.  PLACE SUCKS"}
{"text":"The experience at this restaurant is definitely one of the best. I had the risotto and my husband had the gnocchi meal which were both so lively in flavor. Every bite we had was so delicious and savory.
I also had the fountain of youth cocktail 
The fountain of youth cocktail was definitely one of the best drinks I've tried and I can definitely see why it has that name. The waiter we had \"mark\" really knew his drinks and food. He was so wonderful with my husband and I. The manager herself was super kind and made sure we were happy with the service. I must say that we will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the Valley.  All of the good that I've had here has been great. The squid ink risotto is an absolutely must have.  Also i would recommend that everyone get the pig ears and one of the cheese options.  On top of great food, they have one of the best cocktail programs in the valley. They do both new and old cocktails exceptionally well. There Sazerac is the best I've ever had. Finally, they have the best brunch I've ever had as well. The potato croquettes are amazing. Ask for the homeboy habenero hot sauce as well. The jars they have for brunch are very good as well."}
{"text":"Always a fantastic spot for drinks and dinner. The bar is amazing, with a wide array of options, including my favorite cocktail Rebel's Son. We chose the four course menu, with options including Crudo (raw features), cheese, grilled meals and hot options. I enjoyed the ahi tuna with pistachios, the burratta with a pancetta vinaigrette, the pork belly and polenta entree, and the ah-mazing chocolate hazelnut dessert.

On this particular visit we were celebrating my husband's birthday, and he ordered the octopus Crudo, Straciatella with hazelnuts, the brisket (he raved about the perfectly cooked fingerling potatoes) and the chocolate hazelnut cake.

It was a feast and every bite was delicious! We highly recommend this local spot!!"}
{"text":"Something of a hidden gem, in that it's a little hard to find.  The tasting menu is the way to go, and a couple getting three items each is plenty of food.  We've had nearly everything on the menu, and it is all terrific.  The jalapeño drink (not spicy, very refreshing) butterfish, gnocchi, and risotto were highlights.  One of the best restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"After our horrible experience across the street @ Urban 7 (ie: NOT reccommended!) our little eyes spot this very cute & cozy spot as we walk out and over to our car.  Hmmmm, this place has been here before, hasn't it?  It seemed familar yet different.

A romantic and cozy patio, complete with white tableclothes, and little lights.  We walk into the salon, (which had really cool products and gifts for purchase as you walk in), and we were promplty greeted by a girl behind the salon counter.  We wanted to inquire about the menu & wine tasting. We were nicely pointed in the direction of 2 very hard working and busy chefs.


We were informed by the 2 chefs, who promptly stopped their prepping to eargerly talk to us, that wednesday evenings were wine tasting nights, and yes, they had a representative from a Cali Winery in attendance, as well as providing a little buffet of appies.  

Now, this place is extremely inviting, warm & friendly, (we needed to so get over the nastiness from 7 we just came from - this was NICE - \"hey 7, did you hear that?  be NICE\")

I am awaiting their email invites for what they are excitedly putting toegether, as they have only been open just over 1 mth.  I did not partake of this wine event, but i certainly can't wait to see what other offereings they might have in the future!

(did i mention how nice and attentive everyone was here??? Hellllooo!)"}
{"text":"We made our first trip to Crudo's last night to celebrate my son's 44th. Though not recommended for children we took my 9 and 12 year old grandchildren as they are pretty adventurous eaters. Tucked in back of a strip mall on 36th and Indian School, it is great space with a minimalist look. 

We enjoyed working with our charming waitress to select our dishes which did not disappoint. Between the 5 of us, we sampled the ahi tuna, the yellowtail, the farmer's salad, the beets, the gnocchi, the ricotta cheese, the risotto, the brisket and the pork belly. Everything was uniquely different and delicious and we all oohed and aahed as we shared bites from out plates. I think Crudo is going to be a go-to place for my family. (I want to try the bar food at Happy Hour and Sunday brunch)

Bottom line is it doesn't cost much more to go to Crudo than one of the ubiquitous concept restaurants all over town where the food pretty much tastes the same.

So take a chance. This place will blow you away!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in light of the reviews ....pancetta was drippy and the sushi was over season to the point of being indistinguishable-one fish from another. If you want salt...this is the place. Every dish had the potential for excellence but someone in the kitchen went crazy with the salt distorting and contorting the flavor of every dish - the fish, meat and rizoto was unrecognizable. Truly a tragedy when this meal had the potential for greatness. While the prices were high, I would gladly pay them if the  salt lunatic was locked up. Service was sadly lacking as well and surprisingly...I had to ask that the dirty dishes and silver be replaced when the main courses came. Three people, no alcohol $153  regretfully I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Crudo is a goofy looking restaurant in the middle of a store/hair salon. however the food is great. very simple menu, but very tasty. the wine list is also short but \"intelligent\": most wines are Italian but a good selection.
The Chef is very talented: the Caprese Salad is one of the best in the Valley. the Tuna Crudo is awesome. The Squid ink Risotto also one of the best around. The Mushroom Ragout is just about perfect.
Desserts are OK, It seems they make a big deal about Desserts by Tracy Dempsey, and there is not enough emphasis on the Chef. 
Kudos for Crudo."}
{"text":"This restaurant was hard to find, as it is located in the back of a shopping plaza. But this gives it that \"hidden gem\" appeal. I thought about coming here a long time ago, but I just thought it would be gimmicky: sashimi with an Italian bent. I love both cuisines, but fused together?Thankfully, our great company invited us to go here and I'm so glad we did. I was already impressed upon entering, being hit with the aromas and smokiness in the air. We were seated promptly in the \"conservatory;\" a cool little separate area with one table surrounded by windows and tall oleanders. We all did 3-course menus, which was great because we could try different plates.

FOOD: I'm so glad I listened to our server's suggestions because the albacore and yellowtail sashimi (crudo) were amazing: drizzled with a fruity olive oil with some acid and just the right amount of seasoning. Other standouts were the pork belly, squid ink risotto (finally a restaurant that does it right), and the dumpling. Every dish was very good to amazing. The crispy pig ears were very interesting in flavor, definitely something to try.

SERVICE: our server was Tiffany and she was very professional, friendly, and efficient without being obtrusive. Her recommendations were right on. And along with her assistant, we were well-taken care of. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Be ready for nothing run of the mill here!   The atmosphere itself is unique - not necessarily romantic, because of it's starkness -  appears 'dank' initially, as the ceilings are 2 stories high and the tables are set far and wide apart.   We got there at 6:30, way too early for this place.  We decided to go into the bar which is adjacent, and you should definitely have a cocktail first from this supreme mixologist!  He appeared so busy that initially we thought he was just unfriendly, which is not a good trait for a bartender.  But I was asking so many questions, he finally relented and chatted a little.   You won't stay at the bar long, because the high wooden stools are ridiculously uncomfortable and real back-killers.  It's not contemporary at all - there are 2 mismatched wingback chairs over in the corner that look like someone's grandmother donated them to the cause.  Very funky decor.

We then moved into the dining room, still pretty emptiy and uninviting.   Actually by 8 p.m. it was almost full.  The menu is divided into 4 sections so they make is simple, and since the portions are relatively small, you need to order 3 items, no matter what section they hale from.  There is Crudo (shashimi), Mozzarella (prepared 4 different ways), the Cooked list, which is mostly a variety of pasta, and then the Grilled offerings (fresh fish, short rib, etc.)   The food comes out in a timely manner, and we ordered 6 things on the menu and, hands down, everything was out of this world delicious!   With the possible exception of my fresh coho salmon.  It had a 'squash blossom pesto' which tasted exactly like ordinary pesto, and the fish was pretty, pretty, pretty strong.  I took half of it home (large portion) and it never looked inviting enough in the frig for a repeat performance.  

My husband was there on a prior occasion in a group of 6 guys and they had a great time, so unless you're a true 'foodie' (I.e. the food is the ONLY thing you go out for) I'd take a few more bodies along.   But do be prepared for fresh, fabulous food!"}
{"text":"Yummy! My husband just took me there for our anniversary and it was perfect! Servers and atmosphere were great and the food was so delicious. They also do a 2 course polenta Wednesday special that includes a bottle of wine for starting at $20 a person. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"a little pricey for small portions, i had the fresh mozzarella plate with caramelized onions and a balsamic bacon relish sauce. it was a delightful, light dish. the mozzarella was very fresh and you could cut it like butter.  

I arrived at 5 when they open, and they had bay windows with just the right amount of light shining through the bar with the fresh tantalizing aroma of basil in the air from the bartenders readying their garnishes for the evening. I would recommend this joint to a classy couple looking for a nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"There is one really big negative factor in dining here and it's not the food.  The food in fact is very delicious and some dishes were really outstanding. My issue is the smell of smoke in the dining room- it's so strong that many people who were with me also complained that it made their eyes water. My clothes and hair ended up stinking afterwards. Also the smell probably does not help the flavors of the food or wine... Squid ink risotto and pork dumplings were standouts if you don't mind the smell."}
{"text":"What?!? In Phoenix? I'm so impressed. Lived here for seven years and have continually struggled to find truly good food out here. This place hit the spot. Wow! From the ambience to antipasto to entrees and then the incredible deserts. Well done Crudo. You've truly impressed me. Just lovely in every way."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here last night - it was phenomenal.

I had several small plates including the albacore which practically melted in my mouth; the slice of apple gave it a nice crunch and contrasting tartness. Next was the grilled mozzarella plate which tasted balanced and fresh, with just the right amount of balsamic and basil. Then came the snapper plate; this plate had a chunk of tender snapper fish drizzled with some kind of savory sauce. Every single plate was well put together and so carefully flavorful. 

We ended the meal with the orange olive oil cake. It wasn't very sweet and focused more on the natural taste of the olive oil, pistachios, and orange. If you are in the mood for dessert but aren't into super sweet items, this is definitely for you. It was very unique and enjoyable. 

During the meal I had a drink called the \"Dazed and Infused\" which was very lovely. The base was a sparkling white wine; it was light and refreshing, and looked beautiful as it was garnished with a strawberry slice. Wonderful summer drink. 

The service was great and the restaurant demonstrated a simple yet sophisticated look. 

I had a great experience here tonight and would definitely pay them another visit. It is definitely worth checking out, especially if you are looking for something classy for a special occasion."}
{"text":"If we lived in Phoenix, Crudo would be a weekly stop.  Memorable food at an insanely, reasonable price.  Pork belly, smoked olives, albacore tuna, polenta, risotto, fresh fish--every mouthful a burst of flavor that you didn't want to end.  Don't let the location deter you.  While it may be hard to find, once you enter, you'll never want to leave.  The service is exceptional as the three owners, the chef, dining room waitress (Maureen is the chefs wife), and bar tender, are at the restaurant so you will get personal service.  The portions are generous and the atmosphere is conducive to conversations.  Request a sofa booth (for 2 or 4) for an intimate dinner.  Can't wait to go back--an exceptional evening of fabulous dining."}
{"text":"Pig's ears was very tasty.  Bartender recommended Devil's Short Shorts for Cocktail pairing.  Amazing. Complimented the saltiness if the pig's ears.  The risotto was so-so but the cocktail pairing was spot on.

Easily my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"OK. So this may have to be my new hangout. The staff was fantastic and the food even better. It's hard to get \"black rice\" or Risotto made nearly perfect. They did! You must try it. You won't regret it. You'll go away felling satisfied and happy. And your wallet will thank you too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Innovative, interesting, creative dishes.  We did the 5 course meal so we could try a lot of different menu items.  Some were fantastic, some were just good, none were bad.  The pig ear appetizer is great, as was the grana spread.  As for the main dishes, the semolina gnocchi was spectacular, and the pork belly was phenomenal.  Definitely looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Very happy that we discovered this place. Not too far from my office, great food and drinks. Staff is friendly. Only drawback is it can get very busy, but I guess that's a good thing, better than going to a place that nobody wants to go to, haha.

Met up with some friends here for drinks, ended up staying for dinner. Great vibe, worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is it!  We've been searching for that exquisite foodie experience - you know, delicate bites of perfectly balanced ingredients creatively arranged on a plain white plate.  Well, this is it at last.  
    We, party of six, were seated in the atrium, a tiny room surrounded by floor to ceiling gridded windows; we felt like we were sitting in a European garden room.  We each ordered the three course menu for $35pp.  Outstanding dishes included ahi-tuna (so good my husband refused to share ANY with me, affectively nullifying our marriage).  My butterfish was so silky and buttery and balanced - a dream. The gnocchi was beyond any I've had before - truly little fluffy pillows of tasty cloud, just like Italian cookbooks describe them to be but so seldom achieved.  The butternut squash dumpling showed the earthy squash balanced with fluffy dumpling.  I can't describe it perfectly enough; the balance of each dish was just exquisite.  My mouth kept finding little surprises, like crunchy bits that offset the pillowy bits and acidity that balanced the earthiness.  
    The wine list was concise and interesting with boutique, well priced wines chosen to enhance the food.  We enjoyed a bright Allegrini Soave and rustic Montepulciano.  Usually I'm annoyed by drinking wine out of tumblers/Os/water glasses - stem was invented for a reason, but Crudo's dimpled O-types were better than most attempts at alternative glassware.  
    The service was friendly/professional and perfectly timed.  The wines were served at perfect temps.  The owner added pizzazz by describing each dish as it was set before us, so we could fully digest the unique creativity.  The room(s) provided glowing ambience, an inviting mix of modern and rustic.  The table looked like a refurbished door, sanded to a silky smooth finish.  Cool.  
    If I were an investor, I would insist that the name included the location - the place is hard to find tucked behind the strip mall.  Call it 'Crudo Around Back' or 'Crudo Speakeasy' or 'Crudo Garden in the Back', so that it is clear when one googles the address.  And of course add more signage in the front/side/anywhere the landlords will let you.  
   However, my biggest annoyance: we live in North Scottsdale:(  The distance means a bit of a trek.  But food/service/ambience/creativity this fantastic is worth every mile."}
{"text":"Was expecting much more based on the great ratings.

PROS:
1. Very good fresh food (yellowtail sashimi was clean and fresh tasting) 
2. Amazing cocktails 

CONS:
1. Small portions 
2. Decor. Bare and empty.
3. Waitress unhappy to be there, which made for a less than nice/fun dining experience."}
{"text":"Came here last Monday and had an amazing meal for Chef Brent's pop up dinner. Community style seating lets you get to know your table-mates. Outrageously delicious food. The kimchi perogies were absolutely to die for!! Shrimp were amazing as well. We often dine out, this was one of our favorite meals! Can't wait for the next one! Great service as well, hats off to you and your team!!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Phoenix. Great space, attentive staff and the food is so fantastic."}
{"text":"I travel to phoenix a fair amount from the LA area and finally found a restaurant I would frequent if it was in LA.  The service was outstanding from beginning to end thanks to our waiter John. 

We all went with the 4 course meal for $45. which turned out to be a little bit too much food if anything. I would probably go for 3 courses next time.  I shared the courses with my gf.  We had the yellowtail and the albacore.  I would go with the albacore over the yellowtail.  The yellowtail was not bad, the albacore just had better/bolder flavors. The next course of fresh mozzarella and burrata came out.  They were equal to me, so whatever floats your boat go with it. The remaining courses were the risotto, brisket, pork belly, and beef brasato.  Out of those alI would say the beef brasato was the best.  If you love fat and flavor, well you will love the pork belly.  Finally we had the balsamic pie topped with strawberry jam and olive oil gelato which was fantastic. 

Cocktails:   had the rebel's son (think that's what it was called) and thought it was a great drink.  I followed up with the bali brew which was a great show drink (comes on fire in a tiki glass) but the absinthe was way too overpowering for the rest of the drink.

and yes you can order 4 meat dishes for your 4 course if you really wanted that \"value\".

For a fairly similar price point as the fox restaurants, I don't know how/why this place wasn't jammed and fox restaurants are.  The only slight feedback would be to add a few more mains for variety purposes."}
{"text":"From the first moment Crudo made me smile - the ceramic pig and squirrel by the hostesses desk reminds me of Beatrix Potter and the location is so low key - love it. The drinks are all amazing and not too sweet - my favorite is the Ramble On...

I recommend bar seating for dinner, the staff and bartenders can't be beat, the dining room is a bit more formal and not as cozy as the bar, though eating on a low sofa in a dress provided its own challenges! 
The crispy pig ear was meh, but I loved it the first time. It's fried and delicious but once was enough. Pork Belly stands out as truly amazing - I wanted to bathe in the polenta, and the ricotta with honey is worth a trip to Crudo on its own, and its all I really needed for dinner."}
{"text":"Beautiful inside... I wish they could separate themselves from the rest of the shopping center. It deserves to stand alone. Unique flavoring and wonderful mixology/fusion. I had pasta with squid ink and it was fantastic. You must stop by!"}
{"text":"The food is good, creative and pairs well will their extensive wine selection. Very Hollywood sheik atmosphere, as We were surprised to find this style of restaurant in the back alley of an unusual looking strip mall. It's kinda cool and will go back again to try some of their other interesting small plates."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, divine cocktails and superb cuisine make Crudo a real hidden gem. (Hidden because of it's unassuming location at the back of a strip-mall)

Happy hour runs in the bar area, Tues-Sat from 5pm-7pm and includes $5 select wines, cocktails and small bites. (You will most likely need to ask for the happy hour menu, as it is not well promoted)

The pig ears, smoked olives and Yellowtail crudo are not to be missed!"}
{"text":"The girls and I decided to have a nice dinner out and I had been wanting to eat at Crudo for a long time. I had only been there for happy hour before, which was awesome.
We showed up for our 8:45 reservation and decided to sit at a table in the bar area. The hostess was very kind and accommodating. 
We were informed that all food was 50% off that night...score! We ordered a nice bottle of wine and decided we would each get the four course tasting menu in order to taste almost all of the dishes.
Our first course came out with no problem...then things went downhill fast.
40 minutes after finishing our first course no one had come by our table. Our water, wine and plates were empty. We all tried to get the servers attention with no luck. (I understand the restaurant was busy, but at least stop by and fill our waters, heck we were even going to order another bottle of wine.) He just blatantly ignored us.
I got up to notify the bartender of our issue and he swiftly told me that it was busy because of the food special and to just wait...quite abruptly I might add. 
So I went to the sweet hostess and she said she would try to get someone in to help us. 
In comes Maureen. She was AWESOME! After finding out how long we had waited she immediately went into the kitchen and appeared with our next course. She offered a glass of wine to each of us to make up for the wait. I thought that was very thoughtful and really helped save the evening.

The food here was wonderful, which is the reason they are getting 4 stars. My favorite courses are the Crudo and the cooked. The grilled was lacking for me. (we tried all of each category).

Thank you Maureen and the hostess (wish I had her name) for making our evening awesome after some major bumps in the road.

Lesson of the day: If you are going to Crudo to eat a meal, sit in the dining room!"}
{"text":"If you like strange and weird food you might like it? I hated it...
The group beside us ate a pigs head. Literally!
Yuck"}
{"text":"Crudo is a hidden gem tucked behind the Gaslight shopping center and once you find it and step inside, you're in for a real treat!  We started with Happy Hour drinks and appetizers -- the Crispy Pig's Ear, Butterfish Crudo and Mozzarella were wonderful ways to start up our appetites.  Getting a 4 for $45 was a great way to transform a light noshing into a full dinner and everything was delicious!   The menu has great variety and everything we tried was great.  Highly recommend for a fun Happy Hour, romantic dinner or just gathering of friends.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to try out different kind of food.  We went with our friends and had a great time, but not necessary a place I would go back again for the food.  The dishes have fancy names but it came out okay, not impressive.  Service was great.  We did order the pig head, which requires advance notice/reservation.  The restaurant will ask you to put your credit card down in advance, which was a bit annoying to do over the phone.  Lack of selections on beer but the bar has a very unique atmosphere.  Overall, this is more of a place to have a fun time than a good meal."}
{"text":"Sashimi was exceptional, service was great. Only thing I didn't like was the fact that I left still hungry"}
{"text":"Atmosphere? Awesome! Drinks? They will knock your socks off. Micah has won mixologist of the year for good reason! He does not disappoint. Crispy pig ears were amazing. We also ordered the truffle popcorn; it wasn't awesome. Maybe the popcorn was stale? I'm not sure; had I not ordered it this review would be 5 stars. I really fell in love with this place. My experience was great! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Solid restaurant with excellent food.  However, we encountered an order snafu (wrong dishes served in two of the courses) and the brisket was sub-par (two diners at our table ordered it and agreed.) 

The server did her best to make it right.  

Enjoy a cocktail but stay away from the brisket."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! My husband and I dined at crudo for the first time and we are upset we did not try sooner! Not only was the food unique but delicious! 
Loved the courses concept. We both picked several items and shared everything. The portions were just right for sharing. 
It will be hard in the future to only dine here for special occasions, might need to make Crudo a habit. 
Our service was spot on as well! Tiffany was so helpful and super sweet! 
We enjoyed the yellowtail and ahi crudo. Next course was the barrata, creamy goodness. The mushroom gratin. The last course was the market fish and port belly. Oh and we started off with the pig ears. Yum!!!
Thank you for a wonderful evening. You will see us soon!!"}
{"text":"It's rare to have an Italian restaurant that focuses on crudo, as opposed to the usual pasta and other modern *cooked* Italian dishes. We ordered most of the crudo dishes they had, and all were very, very good. Their squid ink risotto was good, but not amazing. If you come here, definitely order the crudo and pass on the cooked dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious eclectic American food and excellent cocktails. 

Full bar features a wide variety of liquors. As a bourbon drinker, I applaud any place that has Pappy Van Winkle (which this one does). Lead mixologist Micah is a part owner and works Tuesday through Saturday. We liked the 1951 (Old Fashioned) and Rebel Son cocktails.

Recommend: albacore and truffle oil, yellowtail with chive, burrata, grilled mozzarella, mushroom gratin, risotto with squid ink. Pork belly and polenta, and short rib, are also tasty but not as unique.

Bar area is more lively, fun and warm, with about 8-10 dining tables in addition to bar seating. 

Best restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came here last night, and was pleasantly surprised first of all by the tucked away entrance. Very unassuming and welcoming, clean and bright. We were seated at a nice table where to my delight, there was no TVs, no loud groups of bachelorette parties, just a great ambiance to enjoy hopefully a great meal. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the food, the cocktail creations are well balanced. I liked how the menu was presented, with the course options. We decided to go for the $35 per person for 3 courses and decided to add two antipasti and a dessert after. The pig ears in the antipasti section and the smoked olives were really the highlight of my night. The pig ears are a MUST. We had the albacore and the ahi crudos, which were both stellar, then the semolina gnocchi, the burrata, the egg and caviar special, the brasato (which was a little on the dry side), and for dessert, the weird tiramisu something that was nowhere near a tiramisu. All in all, it started out so strong, but the last course (the brasato and the gnocchi) kinda let us down a little, and then the dessert was quite pathetic. They offered to replace with something else, which we didn't do, but it was nice to offer. Service was perfect, ambiance top notch, and because the  pig ears and the albacore crudo were so good, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great brunch - had their version of eggs Benedict but with potato and pork belly. Loved the hot sauce used. 
My wife had the risotto with fried eggs - good but I didn't think the risotto was \"breakfast\". 
Also did the Crudo and Avacado mason jars. Just a great experience."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful valentine day dinner.  Appetizer-Albacore, apple, black garlic, and truffle oil, wonderful.  Cheese course-fresh mozzarella, Carmelites onions, bacon relish, truffle oil with fresh artisan bread.  Main course-Short rib, braised onions, yams, gremolata, quark.  Dessert-Brown butter buckwheat cake with blue berry lemon marmalade with maple cream fraiche.  Each course was memorable and the cost was reasonable."}
{"text":"Okay so this might be one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. 

The cocktails are AMAZING!!! (Try the one with the rosemary branch it it!!) I'm pretty sure they've won awards for their awesome cocktail menu! 

The food also doesn't disappoint! If you are planning on going with a larger group I'd recommend doing their coursing option. This way everyone can choose different items and you can have a more tapas style meal! Be prepared for an expensive bill (especially if you are drinking... the cocktails are roughly 10-15$ each!!)

Yes, in general this place is pricey but you won't be disappointed! Try the crispy pig ears!! It's sounds nasty yes, but you will be amazed with how tasty they are!!! 

Also... a MUST try is the butterfish. Depending on the season they might have to take it off the menu (due to mating season) but if it's available you'd be crazy not to try it!! All the other fish options are delicious too (small portions for these) 

Yum.... now I'm craving butterfish"}
{"text":"I have been so excited to try Crudo. What a disappointment. Everything is so over salted it is hardly eatable. I will not return, not good enough for a second chance."}
{"text":"I've been on a kick of ordering \"family style\" with my friends so we can try as much of the menu as we can. This is a great strategy at Crudo because I'd be hard-pressed to narrow down the hits for an appetite of one. 

Crudo has a great range, in that you have very light and balanced dishes, like the albacore and the yellowfin, to hearty dishes like pork belly and brisket. The albacore crudo (raw) is exceptional, with a bit of truffle oil that complements but doesn't overwhelm. On the heartier side, the pig ear side dish was outstanding. Seriously, if you've never had pig ear before, this would be the one to try first.

The only thing better than the food at Crudo is the bar. They have an extensive cocktail list that is creative and original, with a wink and a nod to old classics. I had a gimlet that paired gin and Fernet Branca with graprefruit and cinnamon. It was impeccably balanced and the grapefruit and cinnamon brought out spice highlights in the Fernet that are usually overpowered when consumed straight.

I should keep this to myself, but take note bourbon fans: they have a few bottles of Pappy Van Winkle. I had the 15 year served neat. Worth the hype."}
{"text":"I'd give it 6 if I could! I went to the Old Town Location before they moved, but I think it's SO much better now. It's a bit hidden, in the back of a strip mall on Camelback. But that's just fine. The layout is very nice and comfortable, albeit a tad dark for my liking (can't read the menu in the dark haha) The food is just awesoeme. You can opt for small plates or larger family style dishes. The small plates range from 3 plates for $25 up to 5 for like $45. I'd recommend sticking with 3 as most of the dishes are not super small. I started with the cripsy pig ear appetizer that was EASILY my favorite appetizer in Phoenix. They're tossed in this sweet semi spicy glaze and super crispy...just insanely good. My 3 small plates were the butter fish crudo with black garlic, apple and truffle oil. this is definitely a small dish, but  packed with flavor! My 2nd dish was this squid ink risotto that was over the moon! My final dish was this short rib with crisp potatoes and truffle vinaigrette. All in all, an awesome meal with great service and I can't WAIT to go back."}
{"text":"Two words for you. Mouth.  Orgasm

Wifey and I decided to eat here for our 5 year wedding anniversary. I have to say this is one of the best meals I've ever eaten, hands down. We bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate that cost $10.00 for a $50.00 Gift Certificate. They also have half priced bottles of wine on Friday nights as well.

I went with the 5 course menu. I chose 2 of the dishes, and let the chef pick the other three. We started out with the Crudo Cheese plate that was phenomenal! It had goat cheese, goat feta, goat mozarella (sooo good), cherry compote, roasted dates, tomatoes, cured lamb jerky, smoked olives and truffles with toast. If that doesn't give you a food stiffy, your not human. The first dish I had, which was one I picked, was the butterfish crudo. It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce, hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now. Holey cow! Next, I had the albacore crudo with truffles, apples, black garlic and pepper. Another amazing dish. My next dish was one the chef selected as well, it was their Japanese Fish Market Special. I don't recall the type of fish, but it was good. I felt bad for this plate though, it had to follow some illlll dishes. The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin. It had hen of the woods, crimini, potato and was topped with an egg. I felt it was just too much, a little clunky. That's probably just my taste though, there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish. I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta. Friggin amazing, I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into it's ear and smack it on the boohiney.  

We went with a great bottle of Nebbiolo, that was exceptional. The service was excellent. At first I was kind of weirded out with the restaurant being inside a retail shop, but we moved to one of the high top tables and it felt more like a quaint little cafe. What a great meal, fargin amazing!!  Pics to come"}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying the food and the ambiance are excellent! I came to Crudo for the first time on a stormy Saturday evening 7/15/17. I was meeting a date, who was already seated and had a cold beer and water. And this is where the mess began...it took 8 minuets for our server (a blonde gal working in the bar area) to great me. 8 minuets! I know because I clocked it. As we were there to enjoy Happy Hour we were barely able to fire off our order before the specials ended. It was another 15 before I had ice water and a cocktail in front of me. We were left alone for another 7 minuets before she re appeared to take our order. The guest count was lively but not slammed. We ordered the smoked olives, ricotta, parmesan, meatball sand which and goat cheese with roasted beets.  All of the food came out but the goat cheese and beets. No one came by to check on us for about 7 minuets and my guest had already completely finished his meal and my food still had not come. Finally, we managed to flag down a gent with a beard and cap and he said he'd rectify the situation. It was another 5 minuets before the food finally appeared, no apologies, no acknowledgment. You can have the most delicious food in the world (Crudo does) but if your service staff is off, it kills the entire experience. Period."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant and I've enjoyed it every time I've gone for dinner. Nice drink menu and the food really is excellent, especially the olive oil. We had a big group for a recent event and they did a great job accommodating us."}
{"text":"This place doesn't quite live up to the hype for me. The actual restaurant is a beautiful restoration of an old house and is very spacious and comfortable. 

The service: we ordered cocktails right away and didn't get them for about 15 minutes and they came right before our first course. I think you should bring out cocktails immediately especially when our first course is raw fish and we don't wanna be sipping on strong bourbon - based drinks. Also, my mother ordered two items while the rest of us four. Our waitress brought out my mom's food immediately so she was stuck watching us eat the rest of the time. At least ask us what we want to do. The server was also pretty cold and uninviting to us. 

The food: the raw fish first course was very good. We shared the ahi, yellowtail and albacore. The cheeses were probably the highlight of the meal. Burrata, Burricotto, and the Mozzarella were all delicious and the portions were huge. I was disappointed by the rest of the food, however. Everything was extremely rich and salty. It's not difficult to load up a plate if polenta and pork belly with flavor. The difficulty is making it subtle. I don't think this restaurant has pulled that off whatsoever. 

I'd probably give this place three stars if it was more expensive or if the portions smaller but it really isn't very expensive for the portions you get."}
{"text":"We walked in the restaurant and I immediately felt calm.  Perhaps it was the dark wood floors, exposed ceiling or even the tranquil ambiance - I don't know, but what I do know is that I was excited to be there.  We were immediately taken to the dining area where she allowed us to choose the table of our choice.  We were then greeted by our kind waiter where she happily took us through the drink menu (offering up their mixologist's specialties should we not see something on the menu we'd prefer) and explained to us the Crudo dining experience.  The experience is not like many restaurants; at Crudo your options include 3, 4 or 5 courses.  

Crudo offers 4 selections for each of its 4 categories, if you will.  Crudo/Raw being the first, followed up with Mozza/Mozzarella, then Cotto/Cooked, and then Griglia/Grilled....and lastly (the 5th), Dolce which means dessert if you've saved any room for it which is highly unlikely.

We had a hard time deciding (thankfully our waiter helped navigate based on both our preferences), but decided to split four courses as follows:

Crudo/Raw - yellowtail - controne, bottarga, iitoi at $12 (who knows what all that means, but I do know I loved it and dreaded the last bite)

Mozza/Mozzarella - Burrata - crisp pancetta, vinaigrette and fresh arugula at $10

Cotto/Cooked - Mushroom - mozzarella, truffle, egg at $16

Griglia/Grilled - Short Rib - grilled root veg, shaved horseradish at $18

It was just enough savory bites to leave me content and wanting to try more of what Crudo offers.  One thing I do want to note is how our waiter informed us that since we decided to split four courses we would be charged at the a la carte price verse the 4 course cost, and she informed us at order time instead of leaving us shocked when the bill was dropped.  Thank you.  

I couldn't have been more wrong about my initial thoughts on the drive to dinner that evening.  Since that night I have been waiting for a reason to return and savor their ricotta, risotto, dumpling, gnocchi and porkbelly dishes to name a few.  Thank you, Crudo, for proving me wrong and making a fan out of me and now anyone and everyone I recommend to your foodie loving establishment.

And to those who are on the fence about going to Crudo because of the limited menu, just go - you will LOVE it."}
{"text":"This weekend marked my third time at Crudo, first for dinner.  I've experienced brunch at this fine establishment twice and now we finally partook in dinner.  After all these meals, I am happy to report the food at Crudo is legit.  I love the open feel of the restaurant and the rustic, upscale decor.  It can be hard to find though, it is right behind another great restaurant, Beckett's Table.  Every time I've come it hasn't been that busy, which is surprising considering the caliber of food.  The service has always been great and the staff is extremely knowledgeable about the menu.

For brunch, I highly recommend the crispy pork benedict.  It is really good... spicy, savory, and just hands down delish.  I've sampled a couple other things including a couple of their \"jars.\"  I really liked the bread pudding and the cheese with bacon jam.  For dinner I had the short ribs and burrata as well as the chocolate cake.  Everything was good... the short ribs were tender and cooked to perfection.  Oh, we also had the pig ears... who knew they could be so good.

I know I'll be back to Crudo, and you should check it out too!  It's not too expensive, but you get upscale food for your buck.  Give it a whirl."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem, tucked away in a rather plain-looking strip mall. 

The ambiance is classy and chic without being stuffy or pretentious. Lighting and decor are gorgeous, and if the weather isn't too cold or rainy the outdoor seating is definitely the way to go. It's a great place to go with friends for dinner, but also has more intimate seating for dates. 

Came here with a couple friends and while the menu has changed quite a bit there are still some good staples they've kept. 

The crispy pig ears are AMAZING. We had two orders. Nice and crunchy, but not overcooked, and not greasy. I had fresh mozzarella with bacon relish and caramelized onion, and I highly recommend it! As of now it's still on the menu. The mozzarella was fresh and the best I've tasted yet, and the relish and onions are a nice balance of sweet and savory. 

The boyfriend had the pork belly, which he loved, and I had the squid ink risotto, which was delicious. It was nice and creamy, but not too rich. 

Cocktails are also phenomenal. The waitstaff is very knowledgeable about both the food and cocktails and helped us choose our drinks based on what we were ordering and what alcohol we like best, and we were not disappointed. Food and drinks paired well. :) 

Their menu is divided into six sections: Appetizers, cheese, grilled, raw, cooked, and dessert. We didn't get dessert when we went but will definitely be doing so in the future. As far as pricing goes, it's definitely reasonable, especially for the quality of the food you get(outstanding!). You can order a la carte or choose a three, four, or five course option($35, $45, and $55, respectively, not counting drinks). 

Will absolutely be returning to try the new menu!"}
{"text":"Went to Crudo with my mother for my birthday last week. It was a phenomenal experience - friendly & prompt service, delicious food, and super tasty cocktails. We were worried about only ordering the 3 course meal, however with two drinks each it just the right amount of food for both of us.

One slight snag from our experience... my mother thoroughly embarrassed me when she asked for a flashlight to read the menu. Our server was very kind and promptly obliged her request. Apparently, the lighting is not ideal for \"mature\" eyes. 

Nonetheless it was a really terrific experience and I recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Oh Good Lord it's a bunch of tasty stuff. Go here or you're wrong!! Meat, meat, meat. Pasta. Fish. Cheese. Wine. And meat! Sorta topas style. Really good."}
{"text":"5 stars? Definitely!

Upon walking in, everything from the atmosphere, decor and staff was warm and inviting. We each ordered a 3 course meal, and agreed on different selections. The addition of a homemade mozzarella appetizer and an amazing dessert meant we each tasted 8 dishes that night. 8 amazingly unique and delicious dishes. 

We tasted from every section of their menu, including raw (butterfish and albacore), cooked (gnocchi and risotto), and meat (short rib and pork belly). Pretty much everything was \"my favorite,\" and a couple of glasses of Barbara complemented the meal perfectly. 

It was pretty quiet on the night we visited... if I may make a suggestion it would be to GO GO GO to Crudo. Like, now."}
{"text":"I'm looking for some really good whisky?  Check!  How about some tasty mezcal?  Yessir!
Got that meatloaf burger?  Delicious
Oh baby Crudo, you got what I need! Cheers"}
{"text":"I've been pretty stingy with giving out five stars to higher end restaurants but last night Crudo came through in a big way.  We wanted to try something new and the idea of small plates sounded perfect.  I'd rather try a bunch of smaller portions than a single large entree any day.  Maybe this is why I like sushi so much.  

We arrived earlier than or reservation yet the hostess was very warm and welcoming and indicated we could be seated right away or enjoy a drink at the bar.  We chose the later and really liked the bar vibe.  It had a farmhouse industrial feel to it and all of the spacing and seating were just right.  The bar was staffed with true mixologists making some pretty complex and wonderful cocktails.  They had great cubes with the cocktails which is something often overlooked.

Despite being busy, when we walked back up to the hostess she picked right up on us asked us if we enjoyed the bar then guided us to our seat.  She also gave us an option of seating which I just loved.  (The Service was starting to impress at this point)

Inside the restaurant we both went for the 4 plates for $45 and skipped the desert.  I added in a side of Crispy Pig Ears on recommendation from a buddy of mine which may have been the world's easiest sell ever.  I'm such a sucker when I see something like that on the menu - add in the crispy pork factor and I'm locked.  My buddy was spot on and the dish was sublime.  The ears had great crispy texture and were in a sweet vinegar and pickled red peppers with just the right amount of heat.  Balancing this dish out with the ingredients in there is not something I underestimate which brings me to my tip #1 - Get the side of pig ears!

As the evening continued, the exquisite control and balance between flavors, color and texture kept resurfacing.  Crudo gets this so well and is up there with the best of the best regardless of city. 

The main plates then began to come out thoughtfully ordered from light to rich and savory.  Raw fish led with very nice Butterfish and Yellowtail.  Both were fresh and very well balanced.  It is amazing the touches just a few very small pieces of Lardo can add to the Butterfish while not overwhelming such a delicate flavor.  

Next came the Burrata Pancetta which was simply perfect.  If you are like me and never tried this cheese before, it's a more gooey mozzarella that is mixed with some cream.  The result is insane particularity when paired with a great hard crusted bread and Arugula.  Tip #2 - get this dish!

Between the two of us we then moved into the Mushroom Gratin and the Risotto with squid ink.  Both were hearty and had more of a \"comfort food\" feeling to them than the other dishes.  The Mushrooms in the gratin were al dente and though I love my veggies like this, I would prefer the woody shrooms to be softened just a bit more.  Flavors on both dishes were excellent and the small chucks of Tuna in the Risotto were just the right add to the light brine and sea flavor of the squid ink.  

Last up were the short rib and the Pork Belly.  This is where I have to stop and give special mention to the Polenta served with the Pork Belly.  I've had Polenta many many many times and this was by far in its own category.  Light and more fluffy with amazing texture and true flavors of fresh picked farm corn.  I could fill a tub with this stuff and just sit in it all day.  It made me so damn happy and would come back for this alone.  The Short Rib was melt in your mouth tender and very well prepared.  

Our waiter was exceptional and understood the oh so rare talent of giving you your privacy yet accommodating every need before you have it. Water was always full as were our cocktails.  Dishes were ordered and timed perfectly having just the right pause in between.  New silverware, timely cleaning and clearing not to mention opening the hallway door to the restroom for my wife.  Yep - Crudo knocked the service bit out of the park.  

The only negatives I can recount were a cramped and busy parking lot, and of all things, their water was not well filtered.  Seems like such an obvious miss to me but so many places get this wrong.  I ended up ordering bottled water with dinner which interestingly enough was a French sourced rather than Italian such as Pellegrino.  it was very nice though particularly the gassed option."}
{"text":"I had the privilege recently dinning at crudo it is located in the Gaslight district at 36th street & Indian School next to Jennifer's Market.

The menu is split up into four categories with a choice of 3 to 5 courses ranging from $35 to $55 dollars per person. I picked a selection from each group.
 
Crudo/Raw (ahi tuna- smoked olives, lemon, egg)
Cotto/Cooked (Risotto - squid ink, chili, tuna, tomato)
Mozza/Mozzarella (Fresh - caramelized onions, bacon relish)
Griglia/Grilled (Short Rib - grilled root veg, horseradish)

The first plate brought out was the raw tuna plate it had a wonderful smoked olive flavor with a hint of lemon and small pieces of egg. The second plate brought out was the mozzarella with caramelized onions and bacon relish delicious. The third and the fourth plate were the grilled short ribs with horseradish and the Squid ink risotto simply amazing.

Also check out the Crudo bar that opens at 5:00 PM serving the absolute best craft cocktails in Phoenix.

My favorite drink is called a Tongue Tied."}
{"text":"Went to Crudo last week to celebrate a friend's birthday.  We decided to do four courses for six people but serve it family style.  In addition, we ordered a couple of the pig's ear and olive appetizers.  When all was said and done, we tried most of the dinner menu and at least a quarter of the hand-crafted bar menu.

The pig's ears were not for me but that was due to the fact that they were freaking pig's ears.  I'm not adventurous.  My companions, however, thought they were outstanding.  I enjoyed the pickled peppers and the mushrooms that came as an accompaniment.

The next course was a variety of sashimi prepared with different sauces and herbs.  Phenomenal!  Having worked in multiple sushi restaurants myself, including one in the bay area of northern Cali where standards are high, I can tell you that the quality and presentation were well deserving of the five start rating.

We then had cheese galore!!!!!  By far this was my favorite part of the night.  The cheeses were all mild, white cheeses and were paired with bread in a variety of ways.  There was bacon, brandied grapes, figs, et cetera.  It was heaven for a fat kid like me.

Next were warm plates followed by the grilled items.  In my opinion, the dumpling was the best warm plate option although most of my party felt that the squid ink risotto and mushroom dishes were the highlights.  Just goes to show you there is something for everyone.  

Last but not least all the meat.  We tried one of everything and doubled up on the pork belly.  Thank goodness we did get two pork bellies because it was the best grilled option.  It was the perfect blend of salty and sweet.

The service was on par with the food.  Both of the highest quality.  Our entire experience was smooth sailing: perfect coursing, anticipated our needs, friendly and knowledgeable.  I wish I could remember the name of the woman who took care of us but I can't.  

All in all one of my favorite dining experiences this year.  The only issue, as I had anticipated, was the price.  It was around $100 p/person after gratuity.  That said, you will leave full and with a buzz for that price.  Great job Crudo.  You have added a few more fans to your following."}
{"text":"Wow this place is unbelievable!  Pig ears where delicious, the burrata cheese was so good and the albacore is a must. Great work crudo we will be back."}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere, wait staff, drinks were excellent.  Waitress gave us helpful tips which were right on.  Had pigs ears (delicious & different), ahi, risotto, sturgeon.  All very, very good and presented beautifully.

Complaint:  This was a Saturday and we used Yelp for reservation that morning.  We were informed several different times on website that only availability was at 5pm or 9pm.  We went with 5pm, arrived, first ones at Crudo's dining room and when we left just before 7pm there were only a very few tables occupied!!  That needs to be corrected.  We would have preferred later seating and/or seating at bar first and then into dinner.

Will go again but will make phone reservations directly with restaurant."}
{"text":"Always amazing food and the best craft cocktails in town. My favorite neighborhood restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I was here for liquid indulgences and Crudo did not disappoint!!! Also little did I know my bartender was the owner!  He made me an absolutely lovely Clover Club with hearts in the 'froth', so beautiful!  It was almost so pretty I didn't want to drink it, but alas I was thirsty ;) I have not eaten at Crudo for the record...I did see some amazing looking food pass by though!  I will be back for more amazing cocktails, service and I definitely need to try the food...If it is anything like Crudo beverages I am sure it will be spectacular!!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is incredible, I'd highly recommend this fine establishment to the most discerning diners. Make sure you aren't in a rush so that you can fully enjoy the experience, and also come with an open palette so you can fully explore whatever their menu happens to be that day. 

When the weather gets cooler, I also highly recommend their beautiful patio."}
{"text":"Hubby and I finally decided that Restaurant Week was the opp to make the trek down to Crudo and find out what all the fuss is about...bottom line -- generally quite good, and the highs were REALLY high, so we give it 5 stars even though the food was inconsistent.

Crispy pigs ears were delish, but the hands-down best stuff is the crudo...albacore was amazing, as was the yellowtail. Next time, the whole meal will be just plate after plate of those.

Cheese courses were disappointing -- burrata was good, but needed either more bacon and arugula, or a smaller ball of cheese, while the ricotta with honey and walnuts was grainy and the bread/toast was scorched rather than grilled.

Semolina gnocchi was good, but the squid ink risotto was a disappointment. I know its a Crudo signature dish, but ours was not really flavorful and lacked creaminess.

Desserts? Out-freaking-standing! Chocolate olive oil cake was really lovely, but you'd sell your first born for another taste of that butterscotch pot de creme. Yeah, we'll be back."}
{"text":"YUUUUM. 

Came on a Friday night with a reservation and had no problem being seated.

My boyfriend and I each ordered the three course option for dining and shared our plates tapas style. 

Salad was a great starter. 
Octopus was by far my favorite. 
Yellowtail was fresh. 
Seafood risotto was amazing and rich. 
Shrimp dish was lemony and perfection. 
The \"tiramisu\" was totally not in any way a tiramisu but was seriously heaven in a little mason jar. 

The only thing that was kind of a bummer was that we each had two drinks.... Our first round was amazing. But we both thought our second drinks were kind of gross.

Service was really kind and attentive and not in an annoying way. 

The space was cozy and attractive. Made me feel like it could've been on Melrose. But then we walked out into the ten pm heat and I instantly remembered we were in Phoenix. Ha.  

Great spot for a date."}
{"text":"I spent a lovely, intimate anniversary dinner here last month. I specifically chose Crudo for the bizarre menu. I wasn't disappointed but at several points during the meal I felt a little oogie, not because the food was bad. I endeavored to try only things I had never eaten in my life, and Crudo delivered. We did the Tasting Menu which was unbelievably priced for the variety and quality offered. The butterfish was delicate, flavorful. I could have had seconds. I'm not a big risotto fan and the squid ink risotto was darkly colored, but I liked it. It was creamy and salty. Nice and different. I chose the burricotta because I had no idea what it was and because it was topped with trout caviar. It was delicious. As the main course, the lamb belly was super. I had pangs of guilt thinking about poor, poor Lamb Chop. Shari Lewis is going to haunt me. While the crispy pig ears were interesting, I've fed too many to my dog to truly enjoy them.

This was a great evening. We had a slow, lingering meal in a dimly lit, quiet dinging area. Our waitress was superb. She was the highlight of the evening, attentive, patient and effortlessly explaining the menu course by course."}
{"text":"Have been to this little gem a few times and have never been disappointed. Whether for food or just cocktails I am always happy when I leave!!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal. My wife and I went for our anniversary and we each got the 4 course tasting menu. Started with the fried pig ears, which we loved. This could easily be a greasy, heavy dish but the bright, acidic sauce and chilies made for a perfect balance. Then on to two raw fish dishes, the yellowtail (excellent, as others have already said) and the butterfish, which was, for me, even better. Followed by the farmer salad which was also good. The watermelon was a nice touch, but the out-of-season tomatoes were not so great. Greens were excellent though, very fresh. 

For the starch course we shared the squid ink risotto and the semolina gnocchi. Again, as others have said, the semolina gnocchi are nothing like traditional potato gnocchi. They're larger, flatter, almost like fried polenta in texture. They're also the best thing we ate all night. An amazing treat. We told our server we wanted to lick the bowl, and she brought us grilled bread to sop up the wonderful sauce. We really appreciated that. My god, it was so delicious. The squid ink risotto we ate second, and I must say the gnocchi made the risotto seem pretty ordinary. In isolation, I think this would be a good risotto, but in comparison, it fell short. 

For the main course we shared the pork belly. It was a tad on the tough side compared to most pork belly I've had, it really shredded when you tried to cut it. I prefer when it slices like butter. But it did taste good. The sweet and sour tomato relish they top it with is too sweet for my taste, but it was still enjoyable. The polenta was good. 

For dessert we had the fig and goat cheese crostada to start, and it was really, really good. Perfect, I'd say. The pastry was delicious and the filling and gelato likewise. We had wanted the butterscotch budino, but they were out of it (fridge had died, ruining the ingredients) so we got the chocolate olive oil cake. I wasn't especially in the mood for chocolate cake, so I was preparing just to have a bite, but it was just too good. In the end we were too full to finish, but both desserts were terrific, about as good as those spectacular gnocchi. 

The service was very good, though it did seem unfortunate that our fine server kept saying \"mars-capone\" every time she meant to say \"mascarpone.\" I liked the wine she recommended, and she was attentive, and her recommendations were solid. The atmosphere in the restaurant is cool, maybe a little on the stark side, especially when it's mostly empty as it was this Tuesday night. The music was a bunch of my favorites (Shins, Spoon, Flaming Lips) played at a subtle enough volume not to interfere with conversation. One suggestion I'd make is that they serve the hot dishes on hot plates and bowls. But overall we loved our meal and we look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Went there for late breakfast/early lunch. Had some bacon jam avocado thing. It was awesome, as was everything else we had."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and dinner. While many people here praise the drinks, I had a nasty one. It was called the Bali something-or-other and came in a tiki mug. This, in hindsight, should have been a clue, but at the time it sounded fun and different. Everyone at our table tried it and made a face of confused horror. They were entertained watching me try to finish it for the next hour or so. I failed. 

Others in our party liked their drinks for the most part, but it seemed pretty hit or miss. Maybe the bartender was trying his own product a little too much last night.  If I go back, I'll skip the drinks.

Oh, and they have a giant wall with all their drinks written on it, and after I stood there reading the wall they hand me a menu saying the wall is out of date and to go off the printed menu instead. I get that it has to be a pain to update that wall, but they made the decision to put it in there. Seemed rather amateur to me to make a wall sized menu and then have to tell people to not pay attention to it. 

The food was much better than the drinks. Went with the 3 dish course, and it was more food than I needed by a long shot. The crudo (raw) part of the menu was fantastic. The risotto was quite tasty as well. Had the pork belly to wrap things up, which was incredibly tasty but about as fatty as you can get. The desserts were all amazing, and I had a few bites of the cherry strudel before giving up out of concern I may explode (and the headache my drink gave me).

Service was fantastic, and the decor was nice but spartan. Overall a good place. I'd give it a 4 for Food and a 2 for Drinks. I went with an overall 4 since they are more about the food, and we had no complaints there. If I go back, I'll probably do a few of the tasty crudo dishes and dessert, then grab drinks somewhere else nearby."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I took a leap of faith after reading some of the reviews here on Yelp.  Although she likes sushi, she's never been much of a fish person.  Crudo I've learned means \"raw\" in Italian.  After ordering two of the Crudo plates (Tuna and Albacore) I think she's finally come around.  Both plates were full of flavor and the textures were extremely complimentary.  We also had the Gnocchi, which was delicious and the Veal, which was over goat cheese polenta.  I can almost definitively say that the Veal was the most tender and flavorful piece of meat I have ever eaten.  The chefs were also kind enough to tempt our taste buds at the start of the meal by serving us a small piece of local watermelon in a squid ink sauce, topped with fresh herbs.  I'm not sure if I was the biggest fan but I love trying new things and I can now check squid ink off my list.  All of the food was so fresh, as they used a lot of produce and dairy from local farmers.  The trick is definitely to go on Fridays.  50% off all bottles of wine.  How many higher end restaurants do you know that run those type of specials on a normally busy night?  The bill was a little pricey in the end but it was worth the three hours spent with my lovely bride to be."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!!! Just get over it and order the Pig Ears!! Promise, it'll be ok!!!
Also who doesn't love a happy hour that last till 7 PM!!"}
{"text":"Go. Just go. Believe all the good reviews and go. Amazing menu, fantastic staff, one of my top 5 EVER. Go."}
{"text":"My husband and I are down right in love with this place. Excellent food and the best bar program in town. We are almost glad we don't live close by because we would be at Crudo way more than what is ideal for our bank account and waistlines.

We've been to Crudo a few times, and each visit has been delightful. We really enjoy sitting in the bar area so we can simultaneously gawk at all the bottles and take advantage of the happy hour specials. On our last visit, my husband got two orders of the famous pig ears, and I had the ricotta with honey and walnut sauce at the bar. The ricotta was so creamy, and the walnut sauce was surprisingly savory. It was a great match to the sweet honey and Noble bread. We each had a couple of the classic cocktails which are $7 during happy hour. They were all expertly crafted with balanced flavors. Much like the food.

In the main dining area, we've had some memorable dishes including the popular squid ink risotto. My husband loved his tuna tartare and fish special. He was really in awe with how well the flavors worked together. I got the crespelle (Italian crepe) full of spinach and mushrooms. It was way heartier than I thought it would be given the price and the usual small plate serving size. I could barely touch my specially made veggie plate, but my husband was happy to finish it off. We both agreed the grilled onions (cipollinis?) on my plate were the best onions we've ever had. 

Needless to say, we're excited to make a return trip soon."}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience. Great service, live music on the patio, beautiful decor. The food, although in VERY small portions, was delectable and unique. 

This is a great for a date night or special occasion."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours I've attended! The bartender actually knows what's going on behind the bar, and has great suggestions! Make sure you get the pig ears! S/o to Andrew the bartender!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Spotty at the bar is the best - if you like fruity and fizzy, ask him to to make you a \"Dazed & Infused\": amazing! \"Buckberry\" cocktail was also really good, along with the meatloaf burger."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great service, even better food. Nice wine list. Really enjoyed our time here."}
{"text":"Burrata cheese, pig ears, dumpling stood out as very good.  Squid ink risotto was good, a little heavy.  Definitely recommend.  Great service.  Water needs to be filtered.  Water not good."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  I would give it more than 5 stars.

The food and service was absolutely outstanding and I love the fact that it is two guys who own it and the girlfriend of one is the hostess/waitress.  First with the service.  The way Anna described the food in great detail, how it was made, the wine, etc. was fabulous.

The food - OMG.   Crudo means raw in Italian.  But don't let that scare you, they have cooked stuff too. This is by far the best food I have had in Scottsdale.  We did the 3/$30 dishes so between the two of us, we got to try 6 different dishes.  I'll describe them all in detail for you foodies.  All of their fruit, veggies and meats come from local vendors and they are so fresh. 

First, they gave us a freebie.  Smoked olives in this yummy smoky olive oil with panini style foccia toasts.  OMG.  The olives weren't pickled and all you could taste was this smoky flavor.  It is the best thing I have ever eaten.  They need to jar these things.  

Japanese Auction Fish - they get fresh fish from Japan.  This was  hamachi - so tender and fresh.  Sliced thinly and sprinkled with small bits of crumbled bacon, small bits of heirloom tomato with a light citrus viniagrette.  - FABULOUS!

Fried squash blossoms stuffed with goat cheese in a beet gastrique.  The beet gastrique was sweet and so very good.

Moved on to the main courses:  Gnocci, so pillowy tender you can't even believe it is gnocci.  It was in a proscuitto  brodo (which is like a broth infused with cheese) - to die for.

Pesto rolled veal, on the plate was this deep, rich, veal gravy that was so tasty.  It had so much depth.  the veal was so tender.  This was my favorite.

My boyfriend's favorite was the Mushrooms Au Gratin -- Oregon mushrooms, truffle,fingerlings, mozzarella, grana padano.  The mushrooms were thick and meaty, yet tender. It was topped with a fried egg, which I didn't think I would like, but it was perfect.  All mixed in with fresh mozzarella.  The truffle oil was subtle and it was seriously one of the best mushroom dishes I have ever had. 

These chefs are absolutely outstanding.  

The only turn off for me and I'm sure a deterrent for others that walk by is that it is part of a hair salon.  The salon is in the back and you can't really tell but the tables inside are next to clothes and jewelry.  These guys really need to get a downtown scottsdale location to really showcase their art.  

Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Just get there!  Micah's cocktails are amazing.  Such a great talent.  The truffle popcorn is ridiculous!  You can order from crudo's menu as well.  Albacore, ahi tuna, polenta and ricotta are outstanding.  Love this place."}
{"text":"This place never ceases to amaze me. The food is delicious and so are their craft cocktails.

Just a few tips - 
1. Since their portions are smaller, they're definitely worth sharing.
2. Sit on the patio when the weather cools down, it's magical."}
{"text":"Ate here last night for the first time.  Great food. Fresh and creative.  Don't be fooled by the menu - these are not tasting portions. Each option is a healthy serving.  My wife and I went for for a 5-course experience and honestly, we could hardly eat a bit of our 5th course. All of it was excellent though."}
{"text":"Belated review after a fantastic evening at Crudo, so I won't be as detailed as I should be, but I loved this place. Really enjoyed the fusion of sushi with Italian. 

The pig ears are something you just have to get; crispy yet they melt in your mouth. My boyfriend and I each got three courses and then split a dessert, which seemed to be just the right amount of food. Not a bad price if you do it that way, as well. 

I loved the spacious atmosphere. Wish we were in town more to come back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Spectacular from beginning to end. The place is beautiful, food excellent. It's a shame the location is hidden so that all might enjoy."}
{"text":"Great selection of classic cocktails for $5 on hh menu. We tried the yellowtail and ahi, both were light and very refreshing. Seating is very limited, but if you get there early its easy to nab a couple seats."}
{"text":"What a fabulous place.  I love the interior design - clean and simple without feeling plain.  The atmosphere easily suits a romantic dinner or meeting the girls for happy hour.  

The drink menu is a thing of beauty. Clearly a lot of thought went into creating these cocktails and that's evident in how they taste.  

They have a tasting course option and that's the way to go here.  Portions are smaller and you'll be able to try a bit of everything.  

Service was excellent.  Our server was friendly and attentive without hovering or whisking the plates away too early.  

I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This chef is truly something special,   Is is he would do cooking classes.  We ate brunch here for the second time today and I am blown away.   Potato croquettes with poached eggs, crispy pork and hollandaise is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Micah has outdone himself yet again. Not only are the cocktail selections from the menu outstanding and completely unique, but I tempt you to suggest a spirit choice and let the fine gentlemen behind the bar hand craft you something extraordinary.  Kudos to Restaurant Crudo for the fabulous apps as well!"}
{"text":"My sister and I dined here early so that we could qualify for the Happy Hour, unfortunately it is only available in the lounge. The waiter said that we could move there if we wanted, but we declined. Fortunately for us, he offered us a 3 course tasting menu for $25 each if we said \"local love!\" which we glad accepted. This restaurant offers that option so that people can try a bunch of food and not feel guilty about dropping cash on cocktails. I - like an idiot - forgot my ID and my sister is not of age yet so we weren't able to partake in any of the alcoholic beverages, but our waiter still honored the deal, which I really appreciated.

Crispy Pig Ears
-Crispy fried pig ears in a vinegar-y, pickled Asian-inspired sauce. To all my viets - reminiscent of nuoc mam. Honestly, we were too weirded out by the fact that we were eating cartilage - that was still ear-shaped to truly enjoy this dish.

Burrata with Pancetta Vin, Arugula
-The arugula was spicy almost, and my least favorite part of the dish. However, the burrata was a great texture and I enjoyed it. This cheese dish comes with a bit of meat on top which was nice.

Pork Belly with Smoked Tomato Agrodolce and Polenta
-Melt in your mouth, buttery pork belly on a bed of polenta (which is a cornmeal porridge). Absolutely scrumptious! If I wasn't so full by this time, I would've polished my plate.

Neapolitan Budino
-Strawberry cream, vanilla panna cotta and dark chocolate pudding in three layers topped with a chocolate biscotti. Since it was layered based on density, the strawberry cream was light and fresh, and the dark chocolate was moist and rich. My favorite layer was the dark chocolate. The cookie on top was okay - I'm not a huge fan of biscotti. 

ONE BIG NEGATIVE: The water here is undrinkable. It tastes strongly of chemicals and was so difficult to drink. I know we shouldn't expect much from tap water but this was truly offensive.

P.S. Parking situation is the back and the restaurant is located in the very back as well."}
{"text":"Certainly one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix for dinner. I love the rustic chic interiors as it was so simple yet still so elegant. 

Food is awesome! My favorite dish would be the fried pig ears dressed in chili and vinegar. All of the crudo dishes are also very delish, but one of the downsides is that they seem to always run out of fish. 

Drinks are also well crafted, the bartenders know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by simply saying, thank you to Crudo.

Crudo, found in old town Scottsdale, is actually inside of a salon right on the corner of 3rd avenue.  Yes, that is right, its inside a retail business operation.  Parking has never been a problem, including last night on a Saturday on Valentines day weekend.

Originally founded by Cullen Campbell and Branden Crouser, formerly of Atlas Bistro, now the kitchen is run by just Cullen, as Branden as moved onto to take over as executive chef at Avalon.  Let me be clear, Cullen Campbell is a culinary genius.  It is reflected not only in his menu or dishes, but in the entire way he operates his business.  This is a chef who will not compromise quality for quantity, on any level.  When yelpers describe what a five star requires, they are speaking about the qualities that Mr. Campbell bring to the valley within Crudo.

Last nights visit brought my standard choice of going off menu for a seven course tasting menu with Chef Campbell making all the decisions for both myself and companion.   Our waitress, with her ever present English accent, informed myself and companion that the live sea urchin would not be on the menu, as there was rough seas yesterday, and their supplier could not fish.  No, I am not kidding guys, this is the type of information you receive at restaurants that tout authenticity and true culinary inventiveness.  I was informed though, that there was some amazing foie gras in the house and I would be seeing it later.  I am getting off track though, so lets get down to what matters.

The Amuse presented to our table was a delightful plate of in house smoked olives.  They were beautifully presented and tasted unique, even for olives.  We were not even into our first course yet and my companion and I shared that look worth a million dollars between us; This was going to be a great evening.  

Our first course arrived and it was Chef Campbell's tried and true favorite, his butterfish crudo.  This is a beautiful, inviting, and absurdly delicious plate of sliced butterfish, marinated with olive oil, spices and what tasted like candied nuts.  No matter what changes to the menu the chef makes over time, this dish will always be there, just ask Thomas Keller at the French Laundry if he can remove his pearls of tapioca or tuna ice cream cones from the menu.  Our second course arrived at the table touting a bright red piece of tuna and fresh heirloom tomato.  Well seasoned with cracked sea salt and the tomato being extremely fresh made this dish satisfying and enjoyable.  We were almost done with our first bottle of champagne when course numero tres arrived and the conger eel made its appearance.  Chef, what are you trying to do me here?  This Eel was so good its scary.  It was a rectangle piece of cooked eel over braised kale.  This dish just kicked my ass, plain and simple, I could eat it for lunch or dinner every day of the week.

We somewhat left the fish courses for the second half of the menu as the braised veal with polenta arrived.  The veal was tender, succulent and tasty as hell.  The polenta, surely house made, was excellent and the perfect accompaniment to the veal.  As this dish ended, some risotto hit the table. Not just any risotto, no, squid ink risotto.  I am unsure where else in Arizona I can acquire squid ink anything, let alone risotto, but here it was, sitting in front of us, in all its glory.  The risotto was cooked perfectly, spread out across the bowl in its perfect texture and sauce and tasted as if I was eating on Iron Chef Japan, the real Iron Chef television show(not the bullshit you see on food network nowadays).  

Just as I thought the evening could not get any better, course number seven arrived, the foie gras.  Lets talk for a second here, alright.  Chef Campbell served my party, a peanut butter and jelly foie gras sandwich. True story.  It took me a second to figure out what was going on my plate as it hit the table, but i quickly figured it out.  There was a thick and delicious slice of prime foie gras on the plate. Underneath, a silky and savory peanut sauce with nuts, while on top of the foie gras was a delicate sauce of poached pear.  Served on the side were thin slices of homemade Challah bread.  Who does this chef think he is??? When put together, this dish kicked the ever loving shit out of me in a way that cannot begin to describe.  It was genius, it was brilliance, it was inventive, it was one chef single handily taking the valley to the next level of culinary adventures.

There is not much more I can say about this restaurant. There is no six star rating on Yelp.  Here is my conclusion, if you consider yourself a foodie, if you consider yourself a culinary adventurer, then do yourself the favor and go to Crudo.  Call ahead, introduce yourself, make a reservation and let them know you are coming for the time of your life. This is the restaurant to treat yourself too, this is the future."}
{"text":"Last night I was lucky enough to try out Crudo for the first time. The crew was soft-launching their dinner menu and offered a VERY special $15 price for a 3-course meal. Chrissy and Dottsy joined me for the 6PM reservation, so the evening was off to a great start. We were seated outside which was still a little chilly, but a small heat lamp was brought out and arranged by our table without our requesting it. 

Their standard menu will offer 3, 4, and 5 course options, at $30, $40 and $50 or you can offer off the menu. Keep in mind that our dinner was a preview, and the menu is not finalized yet. As of now the menu is divided into Freddo and Caldo options and I made my meal of the Butterfish with a citrus glaze, the Hamachi with black garlic and truffle oil, and the Risotto, which had a massive mushroom seared on top and (kind of gross to think about but tasty nonetheless) cock's comb. Yes, the red dangly bits of a chicken. blerg. The risotto was great though, if you didn't know about the cock's comb you would have though it was sauteed mushroom, so that's what I pretended. The Butterfish was great, super buttery and the citrus sauce was just the right note to set it off. Hands down my favorite plate was the Hamachi though, the texture and density of the yellowtail was perfect and the apples, truffle oil and black garlic on it were to die for. 

The wine list we were presented with numbered 5 wines with no prices, and while I'm a Bisol Jeio Prosecco fan I wasn't crazy about the red and white options, but I'm sure they are working on that. Our server was Lisa G, and her presence instigated an odd sort of tourettes in both Dottsy and Chrissy: \"balls! balls! we love your balls! put your balls on the menu!\"

The service, by Lisa and the rest of the Crudo staff and chefs was perfect, perfectly timed, very welcoming, open to questions. I would gladly spend another couple of hours at Crudo enjoying their menu, it was really inspired."}
{"text":"Mushroom Au Gratin is absolutely AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I went here on the advice of a hotel concierge.  He mentioned it as \"Italian Fusion\" but it was nothing like that.  It reminded me of a Tappas place because you get to choose from several courses. Service was very good and our waitress kept our glasses full. The cocktails were excellent and many to choose from....maybe a good place for after dinner drinks and appetizers.   The pig's ear appetizer was on point!  The rest of the meal was just average.  The table next to us got the roasted pigs head which looked interesting but needed 72 hour notice.  My wife and I got the 4 course meal and to be honest the only ones that I could remember was the ravioli (1 ravioli) and the pig ear."}
{"text":"Regular restaurant is great. Highly recommend don't coming for the late night food, banh mi, took us 45 minutes to get our Order and we were the only ones here!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Not one to give out 5s but I thought they deserved better then 4. Price was very reasonable compared to other high end places. Gnocchi,ravioli, yellowtail and of course the amazing butterfish. The owner even gave us a card and said the chef could personalize a meal for us. Best place I've ate at since  I moved to az even better then Kai!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Lauren was wonderful and the food delicious. Especially the albacore, burrata and semolina gnocchi. Rivals any sushi place but a different flavor a so its something new. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Crudo serves up some of the best cocktails in the valley. 

Rebel's Son is the legitimate best cocktail in any bar in this city. It's just so dang good. I mean, maybe I'd like it just a tad more if it was called Rebel's Daughter? But we can't get everything we want.

If you have a date and you want to hardcore judge their taste in cocktails, bring them here. If they don't like it, dump their *ss. This is prime advice, people. It's the perfect bar for happy hour. A couple snacks, a drink or two, and a great vibe for deep conversations about life."}
{"text":"crudo - Modern Italian and Progressive Mixology.  This location was an Awesome location for Wine Down Wednesday! 
 
Crudo definitely matched its concept.  The restaurant is outfitted with simple fixtures, comfortable furnishings, industrial accents, modern concrete flooring, dim lighting, and window-encased alcoves. The décor works well when brought together, much like the exotic combinations in the cuisine and cocktails. I was super impressed with the staff.  Although they don't open until 5, I was still able to wait inside the restaurant which saved me from the AZ heat. 
 
We were greeted by the bartender, or should I say Mixologist.  This guy was truly proud of all of his cocktail creations.  He did an excellent job of asking us what our preferences were and recommended drinks that matched our tastes.  He let us know that all of their juices are fresh squeezed, they make their own infused simple syrup and they only use high quality spirits.  All of the recipes for their drinks were designed by him and are perfectly balanced.  While the alcohol is definitely present in the drinks, you really can't taste it.  In other words the drinks are really flavorful, and they make you relax quickly.  All of a sudden you are feeling Great and then you remember, oh yeah, that was a cocktail I was drinking. 

The drinks start out traditional, but then are upgraded with unique ingredients.  For example one of the ladies had a Whiskey Sour, that was finished off with an egg white.  The foam from the drink even had 3 little hearts on top.  (see the photo below).  I had a drink called Grapexpectations that was a gin based cocktail garnished with grapes along with the Tongue Tied which was a Mescal based cocktail containing lavender and lime.  Other cocktails included the No Name, which is their version of a Manhattan, the crudo margarita and the Milano Gimlet.  All of the drinks were wonderfully flavorful.  I just wanted to try them all.  
 
The food was also delicious.  As stated, it's modern Italian.  In fact crudo translates to Raw in Italian.  It's sashimi with an Italian-style flair (think less ginger, more basil and olives.).  We tried the butterfish, which I personally enjoyed.  We also experienced the crispy pig ears and their burrata.  Don't be alarmed by the crispy pig ears.  These actually reminded me of pork rinds for those of you from the South and are familiar.  If you want a unique and adventurous dining experience with a sexy atmosphere and delicious food, I would definitely recommend crudo."}
{"text":"I had one of the most beautiful meals here last night that I've what in a while.  It was a cuisine where you savor every bite. The course option is such a great deal because you can chose any course from any category. I think this might be one of the most underrated places in Phoenix --- based not on Yelp stars but by busyness. I highly recommend the ahi, burrata, and gnocchetti (which I learned is a smaller version of gnocchi). We also had a wonderful pork bolognese but it's not on the regular menu.  

The service and ambiance were also great. The only recommendation I would have is my wine was not served at the proper temperature (it was too warm). But I was happy to see an option from Montepulciano. My friend had two cocktails - both crafted wonderfully."}
{"text":"What an amazing adventure for all my senses.  I have been waiting to try Crudo and can't wait to go back again.  This is not the snobby establishment it could be nestled in Arcadia.  This is not the place the beautiful people go to show off being beautiful.  This is the place the haves and the have-nots can go to wine, dine, and relax and not worry about being pretentious.  Yet, the caliber of food and staff beats most of the poshy places near by.  In fact, it exceeds most of the places in Phoenix.  Your first stop, is in the bar.  Its not the trendy, industrial looking bar.  Its just class.  And so are the bartenders, ALL of them.  Each one stops by to make sure your glass is full and your needs are met.  Friendly, helpful, great conversationalists and funny.  The Milano Gimlet has a bold, full bodied, unique taste that was a great way to start the evening.  The restaurant is done tastefully, with lots of room so you are not on top of the next table.  Our server, John, explained their menu.  You can order ala carte or by a per person coursing option.  Supposedly, the portions are smaller if you go the latter, but they were far from scant.  We started with crispy pigs ears that explain the dog fixation but being of Jewish descent,  I'm sure my mother was rolling over in her grave.  They were crisp, warm, yummy.  My first portion was the Burrata cheese with pancetta.  The cheese was soft and fluffy and melted in my mouth while the bacon added the right amount of crunch.  Then I tried the Semolina Gnocchi that was enhanced with pork jowls and a truffle sauce.  I think I licked the plate.  I could have stopped there but went on to one more entree of a perfectly broiled brisket that was definitely not my mother's brisket.  We closed with an amazing dolce dessert.  All I can say is there is a reason it is what it is...possibly the best around.  I can't wait to go back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Cru-Do, or Cru-Don't? Crudo forshizzle! My hottie and I tried Crudo for the first time last Friday, and left very satisfied.  The idea of it being in a Salon is a bit strange, especially because the salon is also a boutique... so inside it appears to have a bit of identity crisis, but the outside seating is quant, comfy and offers some great Scottsdale people watching!  The menu is unique; all items are served in small portions, designed for you to try several items.  As a vegetarian, I was offered several options for modification on the menu, so don't be put off by the selections you see online, there is plenty to eat!  Also, the desserts are made daily, so they are not listed on the menu.   Everything was absolutely excellent, starting with the avocado salad, all the way through the goat cheesecake! Our server was very helpful and Chef Cullen came out to check on us a few times as well.  I would definitely recommend Crudo for a special occasion, unless spending $120 for dinner is an everyday thing for you.  Either way, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This really is one of those places that oozes creativity.  Expounding on a number of different influences, but without being married to any one single traditional cuisine.  And yet, much of the food feels strangely traditional and familiar.  I realize that might not make much sense, but as soon as you walk in the door you walk into a open space that feels unique, yet comfortable.  And that feeling carries into the food.  It's not cheap, but on a week like Restaurant Week, you can sample some of Chef Cullen Campbell's greatest hits at a decent discount.

I came here with a couple of friends during AZ Fall Restaurant Week.  All three of us are foodies, but hadn't been here yet.  It's located in the rear of a shopping plaza with fairly limited parking (give yourself an extra 5 mins to find a spot as it can be a chore).  When you walk inside you notice a very lively bar area to your left, and an open roomy dining room on the right.  The booth we were sat in was unbelievably comfortable.  Not sure what it was about the fabric or cushioning, but I probably could've fallen asleep in that booth is was so comfy.

Now, to the food.  We started with a free cocktail for Restaurant Week.  It was some sort of a flavored rum daiquiri with lime.  Pretty tasty and woke up my tastebuds just in time for the meal.  The first course was a yellowtail crudo (essentially a plate of yellowtail fish slices with spices and herbs).  The yellowtail was very fresh and the chile flakes on top gave it a pretty good kick.  I have to say the albacore crudo my friend had was better as it was a mild fish topped with a delicious buttermilk watermelon dressing.  For the second course, I went with the mozzarella with bacon relish and caramelized onions.  Fantastic flavor and that bacon relish really stood out in a big way.  The burrata cheese with pancetta vinaigrette my friend has was also outstanding.  For the third course, I went with the short ribs and added some of their bone marrow.  The short rib wasn't the best I've had but it was tasty and tender and the potatoes were a nice smooth butter-filled accompaniment.  The bone marrow was actually a big disappointment to me.  It was tough to dig out what little marrow there was and it was only enough to enjoy on one small piece of bread.  The flavor was pretty good, but I thought there would've been more to it.  For the final course I went with the chef's homemade bread pudding with blueberries and a lemon puree.  A nice refreshing dessert, though pretty small and didn't really have much of a wow factor compared to some of the other dishes.  

All totaled, four courses of food plus a free cocktail, tax, and tip came to about $70 for me.  I would say it was totally worth it for restaurant week.  The main course was probably the only area of any tangible disappointment and the normal price is still pretty steep in my opinion.  So I can't give this a full 5 stars.  Would it be worth paying more on a normal night?  Your call (most Yelpers seem to say yes).  Overall I like what Chef Cullen has going here.  Creative dishes, a very comfortable atmosphere, and friendly staff.  I'd certainly come back for a special occasion to sample more of their menu.  And if you're looking for a unique valley destination for AZ Restaurant Week, make this a part of your to do list."}
{"text":"Dined here for Restaurant Week and was impressed with most everything. 

Service 5 stars
Food 3.75-4
Drinks 5 stars

We had a group of 6 so we were able to try everything on the prix fixe menu. 
Course 1 - ALBACORE was the best by far! It needed a pinch of salt, but the pickled watermelon rind was phenom. 
Yellowtail was good....but see above. 

Course 2 - 
Ricotta with Walnut Honey - creamy, nutty salty and sweet. Would make a better 4th course, but was still thoroughly enjoyed. 
Burrata - OMG! The heavens parted and the angels sang once I put this in my mouth. Burrata is already so good, but the pancetta vinaigrette elevated it to a new level.
Mozzarella with Bacon relish - I thought this would be my favorite because I LOVE BACON but the balsamic (I think) on the plate overpowered EVERYTHING! Ease up on that and you have a fantastic dish. 

Course 3 -
I ordered the semolina gnocchi but mistakenly assumed it would be your traditional dumpling style gnocchi. It was good, but wasn't what I was hoping for. More like a polenta cake topped with tomato ragu. 

Pork belly - tender and delicious! Can't go wrong with pork belly. 
Short rib - melt in your mouth good....just wish the portion was larger. 
We also chose to order the yellowtail collar on special but they ran out, so instead the made a huge bowl of mussels with the same broth. I could bathe in this broth! By far the best dish of the night!! 

Course 4- 
Bread pudding - a berry bread pudding with lemon curd? It was moist, delicious and surprisingly light for  a bread pudding. 
Butterscotch pot de creme - HOLY MOLY...this dessert blew the bread pudding out of the water! The flavor was more like salted caramel or dulce de leche! 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Crudo had previously been open as a pop-up over in Scottsdale and more recently at this address but had not opened officially as it had to plow through the maze of regulations while it got it's permits.  It is now open!!  BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND, SINCE IT IS ON THE BACK-SIDE OF THE STRIP MALL in which it is located.  Go around back and it is beautifully covered with flowering bushes on the outside.  The inside is a very warm, yet modern looking restaurant.  There are two levels of pre-fixe menus or you can order ala carte from the menu as well.  The chef Cullen Campbell starts with raw seafood as one grouping of four that comprise the menu.  Two grouping effectively comprise appetizers and the other two are entrees.  While I was there eating alone (unfortunately) I started with the Mozzarella Burrata in a diced Pancetta Balsamic reduction sauce with Arugula.  Amazing sauce preparation!!  I followed this with the Short Ribs.  Very simple preparation.  The ribs were sitting on oilve oil mashed potatoes with grilled baby locavore root vegetables, topped with grated horseradish.  What I loved was that you could taste everything.  No cloying sauces to mask the taste of anything.  It was pure simple food preparation at it's best.  The Tiramasu was by Tracy Dempsey Originals.  It was so different.  It was unbeliveably delicious.  The wine list looked like it had a little bit of everything.  I had a really nice Chianti.  All in all, I suggest people try this place.  I intend to keep going back."}
{"text":"Amazing cockatils and amazing bartender! a must go spot w/ a date or by your lonseome. The drinks are the best in the Valley."}
{"text":"My husband made reservations at Crudo for us during restaurant week. We really wanted to try somewhere new in our 'hood. As we walked in I had a feeling this would become a new go-to, and I was right. I loved the space and feel of it. Welcoming, nicely lit, minimal, warm. 

The food was divine, and not only that but our server helped us figure out the right order to get everything in (we were doing a couple things from each of the first two courses) so that our palettes wouldn't be all truffle-y from a couple of our selections. 

We had the butterfish and the albacore. I am a sucker for butterfish but actually liked the albacore better of the two. Quality fish and so different to have an 'italian sashimi', if you will. We also had the warm mushroom with an egg on top. To. Die. For. As much as we wanted to try the squid ink risotto neither of us are big fans of squid and the short ribs and pork belly sounded too good to pass up, which they were. They were both amazing. The sauce on the short ribs was a perfect warm comforting sweet bath of tomato goodness and the pork belly had a ton of flavor. 

The cocktails (we both had an old-fashioned) were strong and well-made. Will be going back (soon I hope!) and bringing friends for sure. My only regret is that we had drinks somewhere else before-- we will be hitting up the bar there next time."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at Crudo last week, which was a set menu with cocktail pairings. The decor and the staff were pitch perfect, once we found the place tucked in the back of the shopping center. Ours was a set menu for a special event, which it seems to me they must to on the regular as they had it down pat. 

The first course was an albacore crudo with green apples and black garlic, which was paired with a vodka cocktail with celery juice and lime. I loved the crisp drink against the buttery albacore, and black garlic is a new one for me! 

The second course was my favorite, both food and drink.  Burratta with marinated tomatoes, pimentos and garlic, served inside a mason jar, with grilled french bread on the side. This was served with a cognac cocktail with cardamom, grapefruit and lemon. I love burratta, and there aren't many places in Oklahoma who serve it, so I only get to have it when I'm traveling. 

The third course was beef brisket with pork sugo in a creamy polenta, paired with Buffalo Trace bourbon with Cointreau and orange bitters. I loved the cocktail, and I enjoyed the dish. My only concern with the dish was my brisket seemed to have even more fat than brisket normally has. But there was so much food, and the dish was so rich, I wasn't unhappy at all to simply side those pieces over to the side and not eat them. If that had been my main entree, I might have taken exception to it. 

I'd love to come back here and check out the full menu and see it full of beautiful people on a busy Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: really cool vibe, kind of minimalistic, clean, open, not crowded, simple, a little rustic but in a modern way. I liked that it was tucked away, not obvious. Atmosphere: 8 out of 10.

Service: knowledgable and attentive, not overly personal. I think our server was \"Mark\". He was a bit odd, not friendly, not unfriendly. Got the job done and was pleasant. Liked that he was open with suggestions and his opinions on the foods. Service: 8 out of 10.

Food: excellent unique drink selections. They use lots of interesting words for ingredients, you'll likely need to ask what some of them mean. Drinks were creative and different than standard mixed drink selections, they were good. Food was high quality and fresh. The portion sizes were a bit small, particularly the fish dishes. I personally found all the raw fish dishes tasted fishy, except one, this was the only thing I didn't like. The other food was very good including both gnocchi's, brisket, cheeses, and the beets with goat cheese was fantastic!! I like that you can simply pick 3, 4 or 5 courses for a fixed price and choose whatever food you like. The food is served one course at a time so it makes for an enjoyable slow paced experience. Portions are fun for sharing. Food: 8.5 out of 10.

Value: the food was not outrageously priced, but overall a bit on the high side, particularly the raw fish dishes with about 5 bites for $12-$14. Drinks are about $12-$14 each, so a couple of those over several hours for a table of four adds up quickly. Value: 7 out of 10.

Overall: would I go back? Yes. Not much more I would try on the menu, we tried almost everything, except the \"whole pig head for the table\" and the \" whole fish collar for the table\". My recommendation: give yourself a few hours to enjoy and relax,  should be a good experience for you."}
{"text":"While at Crudo last weekend we had a fantastic meal. Cassie brought us out an amazing appetizer and also told us that the special that night was worth getting, that and we ordered that followed was beautifully done. The service was great and each and every item was a taste treat."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was perfect for an evening of conversation, not too loud, semi-private seating.  The food was excellent and the wait staff was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient.

All in all, a very nice experience."}
{"text":"I am an admirer of noble works. Arts. Sciences. 

So it should be no surprise when I say I'm a great admirer of Crudo.  

I should be, they've done incredible work. I can feel the hours of dedication to the craft in every dish I ordered. 

Just reminds me of Okra's taller, skinnier sister whose nose was slightly turned up when I smiled at her. 

But I love what you doing here, everything we had, was amaze-balls ( I think the kids are saying this now-a-days).

They've got a fantastic Food'sperience but I just wanted to tell whoever designed the place to RELAX! 

Like have a drink, unwind, kick off your shoes, unbutton your collar. Smile or something lol."}
{"text":"Oh my god...
Oh my god...
My goodness...
Oh my god...

That is what I heard for the last 2 hours eating at Crudo. It is so good, it will make you religious again."}
{"text":"Glorious!!!!!!

My mouth is watering just thinking of the risotto. Dessert was decadent and perfectly sized. Not too small and not too big to make you have sugar hang over the next day."}
{"text":"Probably my #1 restaurant in PHX and I've been to a lot of great places, but Crudo is truly unique and delicious. Imagine combining Italian and sushi together to form a fusion that is out of this world. Your palate will dance with excitement as you go through a tasting menu of raw and cooked combos. I love the crispy pig ear appetizer (it's like thin crispy bacon- but better) and squid ink risotto! But you can't make a bad choice because everything is superb. I love the style and design of the restaurant too, it's beautiful. Great for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Understated decor matches simple flavorful dishes. Great service and new bar area could prove popular. Not for hearty eaters but still proves satisfying.

All dishes were inspiring: home made mozzarella, raw fish, and gnocchi. Every dish offered new insights into refreshing favors.

Quite glad they are in the Arcadia hood."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant! You can't go wrong whether you sit in the bar area or in the main restaurant. The dishes are culinary treats! The best meal ordered was the pork belly with polenta. So good. I'm still dreaming of that dish. The gimlet cocktail was my favorite of the ones ordered at our table. You can't go wrong with this chic, cute restaurant."}
{"text":"This bar and restaurant was highly recommended to me by an excellent and hospitable bartender at cafe boa.  I shot this spot to the top of my must try list and saved it for my last meal in town.
We arrived at 8:40pm, an hour and 20 minutes before closing.
We walked up to an empty host stand at the front door.  We stood there for a moment and looked around.  The restaurant was  mostly full of customers but I saw no one on the floor.
No host, seating people or otherwise.
No servers.
No bussers.
We stepped into the bar and it looked like the entire bar had just vacated as there were empty seats with dirty settings all around.
Still, there was no bartender in sight and no one starting to clean up the mess.  
We sat down on a couch. 
After 2 or 3 more minutes,  a bartender returned. 
He looked at us and we asked if we could sit at the bar.
There was no greeting.
No welcome. 
No, sorry for the wait.
All he said was that it was going to be a few because a lot of people just left.
He could have offered us drinks, menus,  water, or an apology but it seemed as though us being there was a little too much of an inconvenience to make it that far.
We sat down for a moment, the bartender started to make a cocktail and paused to talk to some other customers.
My friend and I looked at each other and left.
I'm very patient and have worked in hospitality for the better part of a decade.
This was probably the worst first impression I've ever gotten from a restaurant that wasn't a hole in the wall.
It was embarassing.  
I'm glad we saved our money."}
{"text":"Very friendly...warm organization. They want you to come back !!!!!

The food is very inventive ..well prepared and with excellent ingredients. When the chef doesn't get too carried away...the food is outstanding.

Yes Yes !!"}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch.  I really wanted to try this place for dinner, but I was in the area (@ Steven Paul for a haircut), was hungry, and had a gift cert from Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  

There are a few paninis and pizzas on the menu for lunch.  They have about 5 or 6 paninis on the menu and they all sounded pretty good.  The chef said the grilled cheese was his fav so I had to go with that.  It wasn't the best grilled cheese I've ever had but it was pretty darn good.  The bread was amazing and the roasted red pepper stuff was a unique touch.  The chips that came with were pretty standard.  The paninis are about 8 bucks a pop so I guess that is pretty standard for the area and not totally outrageous.  

I didn't like, however, that they had no salads on the menu and were out of the 'soup of the day'.

For something sweet my wife and I split the pudding.  It was sweet, chocolaty, thick and rich.  Although it was very small, it was more than enough for 2 people to take a few spoon-fulls so it was perfect.

The chef/cashier was extremely friendly and helpful.  I definitely want to come back to try their dinner creations after looking at the Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"The food and the service here are just way over the top.   Always always top notch. We ordered the uni and a couple of different raw pieces that were all phenomenal and super fresh. The pig ears are to die for.  Literally. No joke. I also tried the bone marrow - really rich but deliciously so. This place is our go to!! Perfect for a date or a married kids with babysitter date!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience!  I had been looking forward to trying this place for over a year and I was not disappointed!

We started our evening off at Bar Crudo and I tried the Dazed and Confused cocktail...so flavorful and beautifully presented.  We then moved into the dining room and opted for the 5 course meal...who knew that would be an overabundance of food!  

I started with the farmer salad with arugula, beets, apples and a fig dressing...amazing!  My next course was the fresh mozzarella with caramelized onions and bacon...heavenly!  Next, the dumpling with pork and sweet potatoes came out...holy moly, that dish was enormous!  Very good, but just too much food - highly recommend sharing this course though.  The market fish came out next...mahi mahi with eggplant and panzanella - light and flavorful.  I rounded out the meal with the chocolate espresso budino - it was very rich and too large of a portion, but I thoroughly enjoyed every bite I tried!

The brunch menu looks amazing too...I already have my eye on 3 dishes I would like to try.

Quiet, hidden location, great service, fresh food and beautiful presentations...you definitely want to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Expensive but completely worth it! The crispy pig ears are as good as everyone says and the drinks were delicious.

All of the food was outstanding, although I favored the Mozza dishes the most. The only dish that I am not certain if I would order again was the Mozzarella, Egg, Truffle Oil. Everything else was delicious and disappeared quickly.

And the service was OUTSTANDING. I have been to a considerable number of high end restaurants and I have to say that I have never experienced better service.

Overall my mouth waters just thinking about the food and I am 100% certain I will visit again in the future."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience from ambience to unique menu and incredible food!  Loved it and can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Crudo is a bit tucked away behind a plaza. Upon entering the back parking lot, I was greeted by a fleet of running crossfitters (just as a warning). When you enter through the doors, there's a bar area on the left and dining room on the right.

Drinks: We ordered a a round of drinks including the Heaven Beside You (pink drink with basil) and the Beets, Rhymes & Life (red talk drink and an old fashion. First two drinks were very refreshing. The Beets drinks was a not beer heavy but could be tasted for those who aren't huge beet fans. Overall very refreshing. Happy hour is available Tuesday - Saturday (5-7 pm) with $7 classic cocktails, $5 wine, $3 beer, and $5 small bites.

Small bites: We ordered a couple dishes of the Crispy Pig ears (it was my first time trying it) and they tasted like small thin fried Chinese chicken wings. I hated that I enjoyed them. Also, recommend the Grana Spread which is a hand full of bread with a garlic and Parmesan spread. Overall very tasty.

Only CON: we all ordered the meatloaf burger ok the happy hour menu. All pumped. They came back and told us they ran out of meatloaf!!!!!! Disappointed."}
{"text":"So i get a reservation at this awesome Italian place my wife has been dying to try for our anniversary... except it's the wrong restaurant [doh].

So we sit in the car for a few minutes and think about it. Is it worth driving across town on a Tuesday to a likely short wait for a table for two or do we go inside to this \"Crudo\" place?

It was one of the best meals of my life. We ate the 4 course chefs choice and it felt like someone was playing my tastebuds like a fiddle [assuming you like fiddles].

This was 2 years back, and I'm finishing this review now, because I'm a lazy bum. I'd provide more details, but I can't remember much beyond the pure joy of every bite of food."}
{"text":"Yellowtail and pig ears were good but the buzz drink and the dazed were great. Bartender was kind of an elitist but I'm over it."}
{"text":"This was our second time at Crudo. We enjoyed the pig ear appetizer and poltenta board the first time that we decided to bring some of our foodie friends with us.

I ordered the Brisket Ceci, Sausage, Peppers, Olives, Pumpkin Seeds, Salsa Verde $18 over poltenta. I received it and there were three slices of brisket, two of which were inedible as they were 90% fat. The third slice had approx. half meat and half fat.
When the waitress came over and asked how everything was, we complained about it and she said, \"It's brisket it's supposed to be like that,\" in a somewhat rude and acquisatory manner (like we wrong to say something). After trying to find some edible pieces to eat, we realized it was a terrible cut with all fat, we called her over again and told her to take it off the bill - which she did.

Lessons learned - although Crudo has some great menu items, it's over priced and doesn't always deliver. The waitress insinuated that we were wrong and that brisket should always be 90% fat. Sadly this changed our opinion and we won't be going there again - off to Fox Restaurant Concepts."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great happy hour. The most eclectic, unique menu I've ever seen. I got the 5 course and just let the server pick the 5 items for me. It was all excellent. Highlights: fried pigs ears, semolina gnocchi, burrata and gargati. $3 craft beer during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. I have been to crudo 3-4 times now for dinner and also a handful of times during mid day to have some amazingly handcrafted cocktails. Each time I visited my wife and I tried something new along with some of our favorites. We have yet to have a dish that would dissapoint. This is absolutely a gem. To start, the handmade cocktails are some of the best in the valley. The originality and twist on original cocktails is extremely refreshing. The square garden is hands down my favorite cocktail before, during or after a meal. I have traveled to Crudo specifically for that cocktail. Other notable mentions are the Arcadia Club, 1951 and Triple Lindy.

Regarding the entrees, we have tried many different dishes and always been satisfied. The absolutely most suprising and satisfying dish is the Mushroom gratin. A close second is the pork belly and the albacore. The cheeses are all fantastic too. The only dish that I do not order anymore, not because of its taste but because it is too rich to go with the rest, is the risotto. But its still delish. 

Anyhow, its a great place and very reasonably priced for the menu. Drink though can get a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Crudo is the epitome of a true dining experience. The atmosphere is warm and swanky, especially in combination with their inventive cocktails. The food presentation is clean and the flavors are decadent, but comforting. I am pretty sure I've had multiple dreams about the texture of their olive oil whipped goat cheese against the earthy grilled beets!"}
{"text":"Crudo is one of my favorite spots in the valley and to some, a hidden gem. I've been here several times and never disappointed in the service or amazing food. 

My last experience Jeff was the bar tender and he was the man. Super accommodating, friendly, shook my hand (and other customers hands and introduced himself), checked up periodically but wasn't annoying, and overall genuineness to his delivery of service. 

Chef as always does a phenomenal job with food. Went for HH and had the pigs ears (a must try), smokey olives, and it was Wednesday and got the polenta. It came with an arugula salad and the polenta had a bolognese braised brisket on top that was absolutely killer. 

They probably have one of the best and classiest happy hour in town. Meaning the food and drink options are on point and will still leave you full. The ambience is almost like a speak easy but more vibrant and again I can't say enough about the execution of food that is provided. 

This is a great place for a group of friends or to take a date or even go by yourself and post up at the bar. It is a gem in the valley and if you haven't been, it's time to go. You won't ever get bad service here, they are top notch all day long."}
{"text":"One of my favorite experiences I have had in Phoenix. Food was great and the drinks were very special too. We were sadly not in love with our pasta course, but everything else was great. Will definitely go back to check out the brunch."}
{"text":"Went to Crudo for brunch this morning. Has the spinach iitios scramble with avocado toast.  Simple but with a touch of flavor from the green onions and spinach. My friend had a slight mishap with his meal and the staff were very professional in correcting the issue and going above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. Impressed by their customer service."}
{"text":"I immediately fell in love with this restaurant. From the secluded and hidden outside to the wonderful decor inside, this is a one-of-a-kind Phoenix place. 

Food is exquisite. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu. Started with the Fresh Mozzarella, bacon relish and caramelized onion (portion is small), but extremely tasty and the balsamic is delicious. Time to dip the bread! Next was the crispy pig ears, I was doubtful but after all the reviews about them, I just ordered. Glad I did. It's hard to get my head around of what they are, but the chef puts an excellent twist on these. Try them.

Pork belly, risotto, yellowtail and grilled mozzarella are on the list to order the next go around, which is going to be very soon! Happy hour is great here, such a variety on their drink menu. If you're looking for something strong, I suggest a Manhattan :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic, great for dates. Took my girl, had squid ink, yellowtail and pork belly. All were great and flavorful. Also trued pug ears and sauce was amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow.  So. Good.  I could just leave it at that.  

First, don't let the non-descript strip mall look from the outside turn you away.  The actual space inside and is a pretty cool ambiance for unwinding and enjoying good food after a busy week.  When we were there for dinner it was mostly professionals all enjoying a nice, relaxing quiet dinner.  

Started out with some hamachi that had a grapefruit component that completely washed out any flavor from the fish.  Point of sushi is to enjoy the flavor of the fish. Huge miss.  I asked the server about it, if I were missing the concept or something and she agreed.  And without me asking or anything further she brought out another sushi dish that was delicious.  Huge save.  I think it's very classy to when restaurants do this without you having to ask and be \"that guy\".  Makes the experience much better and is a huge win in my book. And big points for the server!

Next up were cheese courses.  House made mozz with bacon which was good.  But the ricotta with honey and a walnut sauce that was just fabulous.  Savored every bite.  

We were already on a roll when the entrees hit the table.  I ordered a brisket with a tower of bone marrow and the flavor combos were just sensational.  (Yes, I said a TOWER of bone marrow.  Well played sir, well played.)  I liked the brisket was not sauced allowing to enjoy the flavor of the brisket and in a different way then usual.  And the bone marrow was a wonderful accompaniment.

Overall the service, food, and ambiance was very satisfying and I can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"Amazing decor, very friendly and knowledgeable staff, I only wish they had a few more items on their apps/starters menu. The Crispy Pig Ears are a must-try! And their Whipped Goat Cheese with Beets was outstanding, but that's all I cared for. In terms of entrées however, they had plenty of delicious choices, but I fell immediately for the brisket! So tender and moist, you could cut into it with your fork like butter, no knife necessary. They're a bit tucked away which is nice, makes it feel more exclusive, but I was surprised to see that they weren't very busy (we were there late on a Thursday night, they close at 10) so I'm curious as to what their regular nights look like, because it is not a small establishment. I do like that the bar is on the opposite wing of the restaurant, although it doesn't strike me as the type of place sports fanatics would gather for a game, but it can indeed change the overall feel if too close."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates."}
{"text":"Would have given a 6 if possible.  A foodie find for sure.  Great service - great food and environment.  You need to try the pig ears!

A very small criticism:  we both had the mushroom/egg dish.  It was very good, however we both thought the egg wasn't organic - which would have given a richer taste.  The egg was also slightly over cooked.  For this dish it should have been runny."}
{"text":"NOTE:  rating only the bar

Stopped in for drinks before dinner next door at The Market.  Immediately noticed that it was pretty quiet (was only 6p on a Saturday).  We had actually tried to get reservations, but opted for elsewhere when Opentable showed only 5p and 9p available... Surprising as the place was empty at 6 and not on a long wait at 7.

Nice looking place.  Very modern, gentrified old building type feel,  

Sat down and looked over the drink menu.   It was quite cool.   A large list of cleverly-named featured cocktails with creative ingredient lists... I had the Scotch Baio.   My wife had the Temporary Treuse (like chartreuse...).  We were actually quite excited to try it out.  Unfortunately, the marketing turned out to be far better than the product.  Both drinks were interesting but overly sweet and more like something you'd find at Fat Tuesday or something.  Honestly, they gave the impression that someone is trying way too hard to be creative and special...  Maybe we just made poor choices,

Service was solid.  At some point we'll be back to try a full meal (the place did smell spectacular)."}
{"text":"Awesome unique food creations. Italian inspired smaller plates. Polenta, short ribs, mushrooms etc. Good wine program. Friendly owners and staff. Nice location off the street. Worth finding. Comfortable open dining room and alcoves."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good wine selection (plenty in the 40-50$ per bottle range)."}
{"text":"Best dessert ever created, the chocolate hazelnut crunch cake.
$6 pints of a lovely tripel, victorious golden monkey I believe.

Atmosphere on point, staff on point  (thank you amanda) and will be taking literally everyone I go out to eat with to this lovely little place."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Crudo last night, while in Phoenix.  Amazing food, service and tasty cocktails.  Would recommend the Squid Ink Risotto and Buratta Cheese plate.  Our waiter was great and the bartenders made our happy hour very fun and entertaining.  Highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Random and somewhat hard to find location, but the food is to DIE for! Very unique concept, raw italian food. But the taste is impeccable. I hope they haven't closed :("}
{"text":"Crudo was a new restaurant my wife and I were really excited and looked forward to trying during restaurant week.  Unfortunately, Crudo fell short to our expectations after hearing such rave reviews about it.  Service was spotty at best.  Our waitress even failed to remember to order one of the dishes we supplemented to our meal.  May we suggest to her to simply writing down her customer's order like your fellow colleagues did versus trying to remember everything especially when you decide to stop by other tables on the way to the register?  This should not happen at a restaurant of this level. 

We accepted to pair wines with our meal.  I probably should have questioned it when the wines were not listed with the food... I will elaborate later.  The first two courses went off with out a hitch.  The sashimi styled first course and cheese themed second course were excellent.  The food and wines pairings were both enjoyable.

However on the third course, things began to go south.  My wife and I asked our server what the wine pairings were going to be with our main entees.  It was important since our dinners were fish and beef.  We had to challenge our waitress when she said the chef paired the same with both dishes.  She wanted to bring the same hearty Itallian red wine with both my beef brisket and my wife's seafood dish.  We finally got her to discuss it with the chef who understood our concerns and supplemented with a more appropriate white wine with the fish. The dinners included the Chef special - a \"yellowtail collar\" dish - and and as I previously stated their beef brisket.  Both meals barely had any sides with their proteins.  The yellowtail collar was enjoyable, but and the brisket dish was underwhelming in taste even with the bone marrow supplement.  

Unfortunately, the third courses just fell short after having such a great start to our dinner.  It was a shame because it caused us to leave earlier than we anticipated and not order desert.  It may also cause us to reconsider coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Know this - I am VERY PICKY when it comes to Italian Food (lived in Italy for over 5 years) so when a place bills itself as \"Modern Italian\" my skepticism meter goes bonkers....

However, this place - what a find!  Great atmosphere, fantastic service, and a unique twist on gourmet Italian food.  Three courses for $35 is an absolute steal as well.

Started with Yellowtail (fresh, delightful and unique truffle flavoring), continued with Squid Ink Risotto ( a very particular dish which was executed perfectly), and finished with the pork belly...  Couldn't have been happier.  Note - I was also there with Italian friends (I mean, real Italians, not Americans with last names ending in vowels who claim some past lineage to Rome) and they raved about Crudo as well (and they are even more picky than I..).

All-in-all, this is fast becoming one of my favorites in Phoenix - and I swear it was motivated by more than the fantastic cocktails to kick off the evening...."}
{"text":"Hit up crudo for the restaurant week menu last weekend. Great place! It's tucked back behind a strip mall but when you walk in that is totally forgotten. Very nice modern and clean space,

We were seated and ordered cocktails. I had the rock, paper, scissors. Bourbon based with some nice lemon flavor. Very tasty. I had several.

The restaurant week menu was prefix with a few choices. Our first course was crudos of albacore and yellowtail. Both very good, I preferred the albacore.

Second course were the cheeses. We had the burratta and the mozzarella. As expected, delicious fresh cheeses.

For our entrees my wife went with the special which was yellowtail collar cooked with mussels and supposedly spicy sausage (said sausage was not seen in the dish). The flavored were great but the fish was small with lots of bones. Don't think my wife liked it. I had the braised short rib with bone marrow and mashed potatoes. Very good. Could of used a little salt and something the spread the marrow on but overall, a successful dish.

For desert we had the bread pudding which was awesome. The complimentary cocktail that came with restaurant week was a White Russian. That is not a drink most people would choose and frankly neither of us enjoyed it. With such a big cocktail menu they should have given us options.

I will go back to crudo. Overall, I give them 4.5 stars. Yelp is correct on this one."}
{"text":"My sister and I dined at Crudo on an early Friday evening and opted for the Coursing Option of 3 courses for $35. 

Crispy Pig Ears 
- I think I would have enjoyed this dish MUCH more had I not been aware of the fact that they were indeed pig ears. However, they were crispy and were doused in a nice pickled sauce. If you're not as fainthearted as me or a bit more adventurous with your dining experiences, this is a great starter. 

Albacore with Apple, Black Garlic, Truffle Oil 
- I really loved the albacore sashimi paired with the truffle oil. The chunks of black garlic were a bit pungent and foreign to my taste buds but after a few pieces, I was used to the flavor and ended up really enjoying it! 
- 4/5 for taste 

Fresh Mozzarella with Bacon Relish, Caramelized Onion 
- Refreshing and light. Completely in love with every aspect of this dish! No complaints here. 
- 4.5/5 for taste; without a doubt, my favorite dish of the night. 

Brisket with Peaches, Radicchio, Parsnip, Buttermilk 
- The dish had a generous portion of brisket. It was melt in your mouth flavor (due to the fact that there were huge blocks of delicious fat mmm). I was not a huge fan of the pureed parnsip; it had a bitter taste and oddly enough, was reminiscent of gasoline, in my opinion. 
- The grilled peaches balanced out the savory brisket of this dish; the sugar in the peaches was caramelized from the heat, giving it really nice flavor. 
- 4/5 for taste 

Neapolitan Budino
- A three-layered dessert presented in a dainty, mini mason jar. It consisted of strawberry crem, vanilla malt panna cotta and dark chocolate. The strawberry crem was light and slightly runny but bursting with strawberry flavor. I loved the thick texture of the panna cotta and the dark chocolate. The dessert also came with a dark chocolate cookie. Although it was chocolate-y, it had the texture of dirt, which I found to be really unpleasant. 
- 3.5 for taste

Overall, Crudo met my expectations for what I expected out of this dining experience. We had a really sweet and attentive waiter, who guided us through our first time at Crudo. One thing I will comment on is the atmosphere: I was expecting a hip crowd but the restaurant was bare and predominantly empty."}
{"text":"Take a deep breath before you go in here because, after you come out, no other restaurant in this town (or many others) will compare. The food is phenomenal because it is inventive, always consistent, and simply delicious. The menu approach is so perfect because it encourages you to experience so many different flavors and textures in the same sitting. The service is so spot on between casual and knowledgeable that they should be training everyone in town in how to provide people with an exceptional customer experience each and every time. Lastly, the drinks and the bar program are inspiring to anyone who loves great cocktails crafted with both passion and skill. Everything from the classics to the originals (and everything in between) will make you believe that you have been transported to NYC or Chicago, or SF. If you haven't been here, go here now and keep going. If you have been here, go back often, and (like me) try to find any excuse you can to keep going back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant!  I had never heard of this place before.  My husband took my culinary artist/famous tv chef to be 12 year old son and me to Crudo last night.  He had heard about it from a friend at work and since it is \"Restaurant Week\" he decided to try something new.

I can honestly say that this was THE BEST food I have ever eaten.  Flavor explosions in my mouth!!  I got to taste a variety of the menu since we all got different items.  Everything was delicious, my entree wast the best.  I had the pork belly with soft polenta.  AMAZING!!!  I will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate some personal successes and was blown away as usual. To be honest, I've only ever been for the amazing cocktails, burrata, truffle popcorn and squid ink risotto, but those dishes alone make me want to recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  First, we ordered the Burrata (of course) because it's the best house-made burrata ever.  Next, we had the Semolina Gnocchi with Lamb neck that instigated a small battle of the forks (Next time, we'll just have to get our own).  The sauce alone I'd like to bathe in, but the lamb was cooked amazingly and the gnocchi was the perfect complement.   After that we had the Cavatelli with Braised Hen and a Pullet egg.  My companion was very excited about this dish because of the Pullet Egg.  I really have never eaten anything like this dish before, but I found it interesting and hearty.  Cooked perfectly with great texture.  Obviously at this point we couldn't say no to Tracey Dempsey desserts.  I was pining over the apple crostada, but my friend insisted upon the chocolate hazelnut dessert.  Complete bliss, but I required a second glass of the Italian Red Blend because who eats chocolate without wine?  Last but not least, Keifer is a wizard when it comes to mixology.   We ( I say \"we\" but I couldn't help but keep tasting his drinks) had a delightful pink cocktail that I can't remember the name of or whats in it, but so delicious I wanted to order a carafe.  The other one was the Smoke n Bols that I insisted my friend drink because it had all my favorite components, Vida Mezcal, Bols Genever, ginger, vanilla, lime and a Ruby Port.  I'm not excited very easily about a restaurant, but Crudo literally makes my heart sing and everyone should eat here at some point in their lives."}
{"text":"Met a friend for happy hour after work.  The menu has many options.  We ordered quite a bit of food, but what stood out to us the most was the fresh mozzarella.  It was so good, we ordered two orders.  It sounds like such a basic dish, but they took a basic dish to the next level!  I loved the octopus crude and the butterfish.  I also would recommend the pig ears."}
{"text":"The bar menu and care for detail in the mixology makes this a special stop. The staff is very interested in offering a quality product---high quality does not mean high brow. Down to earth and accessible: am I in Seattle or SF. Nice!
Restaurant next...expecting to find more of the same quality."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow...amazing cocktails and their bread is to die for. Came in during happy hour, which is also great - 5-close Tuesday through Thursday. Have a nice selection of classic cocktails and small bites on there. I had the 'The Last Word' per the bartenders recommendation and the Buricotta bread and cheese dish, so great. Lovely ambiance in the bar area and great service.
It's too bad this place is tucked behind the shopping Center off Indian school rd. It is literally a hidden gem but so glad we discovered it! Would definitely recommend for the happy hour, can't comment on their dinner options but I imagine they would be incredible as well!"}
{"text":"The food, cocktails and service here is consistently outstanding.

It's in a very unassuming location, but don't let that make an impression on the skills of the bartenders, servers, and cooks/chefs at this restaurant. The food, cocktails, and service are consistently phenomenal. My wife and I have never had a bad meal here.

We would like to give special recognition to the young lady who served us on the evening of Friday, July 28, 2017. She had to deal with an obnoxious couple who were dining next to us and was still able to deliver a wonderful night of service to us. I admired her ability to patiently deal with this awful couple and we appreciate the wonderful service you gave us!

I would suggest this restaurant to anyone who has not yet tried it!"}
{"text":"Crudo...the name says it all. From the service, attitude, and raw food we received,  this restaurant won't be seeing me or any of my friends again! First, when the reservations were made, we let the restaurant know we were celebrating a birthday with family from out of town and that there was an allergy. The host, nor the server ever threw out a \"happy birthday, thank you for celebrating your birthday with us\" that night, which is not only rude, but careless as well. When there are notes on a reservation, call me crazy, but the restaurant should be reading them. Failure to do so means they don't give a shit about their customers, they are not paying attention to details, and their customer service sucks. 

My brother ordered a pasta with braised hen. There was a neck bone and another miscellaneous bone in there, which he ended up chipping a tooth with. At this point, we weren't upset. He just wanted to let the server know so she may inform the kitchen so they can check other dishes coming out for other guests. Her response was so appalling that this is where it turned south for all of us. She not only gave us a shit face but she also said \"well, that's normal. We use fresh chicken and shred the meat here.\" No fucking way!!! Fresh meat?!!! This whole time I was expecting for you to serve me decaying, rotten meat. Thank goodness for fresh meat! Listen, I'm an Executive Sous Chef and I think I know a thing or two about food. Food is not supposed to have bones in them unless you are serving a bone-in piece of chicken or meat. End of story. Just admit you're wrong, apologize, and offer the guest a chance for the restaurant to fix it. But you'd think she'd stop there...absolutely not! She gave my brother attitude after he explained he just wanted to let her know so she can let the kitchen know and they can check all other dishes. After this, she still looked stupefied and kept making excuses and made him feel like he was wrong with a \"how dare you question me\" attitude. I wish I would've gotten her name but she is blonde, tall, and obviously arrogant server that was working this past Friday evening. 

Moreover, the entire table did the tasting menu and one of my sister's dishes she chose was the butterfish. I chose the same dish but they came out at different times due to the other items we each chose. Mine came out first and it was delicious. When hers came out it looked perfect, until she cut into it. I know the restaurant's name is Crudo, which means raw in Spanish, however, this dish was supposed to be cooked. The fish was seared and the entire inside was raw. My sister cut it in 4 pieces to make sure it was inedible before we said something. We let another server know because we couldn't find ours for a good 5 minutes. The one that came over was very apologetic and when she saw the fish she said \"oh wow, yea, that's very raw. I'm so sorry about this.\" She took the plate and the rest of the table finished their courses by the time hers came. When her food arrived, it was the same piece of fish she received earlier in 4 chunks. Really? They couldn't give her a new piece and cook it correctly? By this point, I wouldn't expect anything less. Anyone that actually knows what they're doing, knows that cooking a piece of fish whole is not the same as cooking 4 chunks of fish. By doing this, the fish was overcooked and dry. It lost all the moisture and was dryer than the Sonoran desert. It was awful. Clearly they don't have a chef back there in the kitchen and only wannabes that think they're chefs just because they watch Food Network or Cooking Channel and now think they are Michelin star chefs. A chef would never sacrifice the integrity of the fish and take short cuts like they did by cooking the same piece of fish in 4 chunks, which looked more like fish tacos to me. When my sister mentioned this to our server, what do you think happened? The attitude came out once again! This lady is clearly in the wrong business. She should be working behind a toll both where no one needs to see her nasty face or hear her rude comments. 

We finally get the bill and instead of her shutting up and not saying anything, she gives us a snarky apology. She was sarcastic and rolled her eyes about the fish. Exactly like when your mom tells you to apologize to someone and you don't mean it and just say it. She seemed like she was clearly annoyed and had a better place to be. She obviously wasn't sorry because when my siblings told her something was wrong, she acted doubtful and defended her lame excuses. But then at the end she comes and apologizes, which wasn't sincere at all. She clearly knew it was time for the bill and her tip was resting on her piss-poor attitude and service. 

The food at this restaurant wasn't that bad, with the exception of the bones in the food and raw fish that was served, I'd actually say it was about a 3. However, with the lack of service and attitude from the server, I'd give this restaurant a negative 2!"}
{"text":"This spot has been on my ' to eat list' since it opened and, in spite of the slowly building expectations, it definitely lived up to my self imposed hype.  The menu and prices are custom made for those of us wanting to more thoroughly explore the Italian dining table.  Each dish was expertly crafted and we were in constant amazement that such diversity and execution could come out of such a small kitchen.  An incredible experience and definitely a place to take those out of town guests who are looking to truly appreciate how great a culinary town Phoenix has become."}
{"text":"As far as salon-cafes go, this has got to be one of the better ones.  The sandwiches, while not particularly ground breaking, are thoughtful and assembled with quality components.  Also has a pretty good old-town ambiance."}
{"text":"The cocktails definitely lived up to their reputation!  The squid ink risotto and mushroom dish were our favs, even over the pork dishes."}
{"text":"Still dreaming of the beef brisket with bone marrow I devoured last night, my taste buds are at a loss today because nothing I have around compares to it. The pure decadence of the brisket with added bone marrow (totally worth the addition in case I haven't made that clear yet) almost seemed sinful to eat. Thank goodness the chef threw some fingerling potatoes and other traces of veggies in there to help absorb some of that gluttonous feeling. 

The sea urchin risotto came a close second in taste happiness. Don't worry, there wasn't plump sea urchin chunks all over the risotto. The pieces were small and mixed in well along with mussels, clams and tomatoes so they all complimented each other well. 

The lamb belly had the tiniest hint of gamey just so that you knew you were not eating your typical meat fare of beef or pork, yet it was prepared so well that it was very enjoyable. Tender and fatty as expected and of course flavorful! 

The pork belly on polenta with tomato agrodolce was really good. It had very potent flavor. I don't know if it's possible but I almost tasted a tartness to it especially after eating the beef brisket and bone marrow. It was hard to have this follow the brisket because it was like a B list act following an A lister. Really good but you're still left longing for the other. 

Under the antipasti section, the yellowtail and the ahi were both so fresh and tasty! I couldn't really discern the pistachios in the ahi mix but I really enjoyed it. I couldn't tell you what the yellow tail ingredients were but I liked it even more. Just kidding, I Googled.. controne (Italian hot pepper), Bottarga (Italian delicacy of cured fish roe), iitois (looks like a green onion). These ingredients really brought out the finest qualities of the yellowtail. 

Now outside of the food, Crudo is very charming, tucked away behind a lot of greenery on the back side of an old business mall in between The Market by Jennifer and a crossfit gym (or box). The French doors make it seem like you are in the country side. The staff is very warm and welcoming. 

I chose Crudo because we were celebrating my mother in law's birthday and I indicated this on OpenTable so Crudo gave us complementary champagne upon arrival to toast! We ordered from the tasting menu sampler where you get to chose 3, 4, or 5 items from the anti pasti, pasta, and secondi categories. My hubby and I are always Go Big or Go Home types so of course we indulged with the 5 selections for $60. Our waitress explained that portions would be a little smaller to allow for more tasting room and the dinner would be longer. She wasn't kidding, since we were there for 3 hours. 

Only one slight mishap occurred. Everything was going swimmingly UNTIL I ate my 4th course (the brisket with bone marrow) too slowly and they didn't want to rush me so since my hubby and his dad finished their 4th (the pork belly), they brought out the 5th course to them and forgot to bring mine out. Once our waitress found out, she was so apologetic and I soon had my pork belly but by then everyone was done eating. I don't think they could've eaten more even if she did bring plates for them to share that 5th course. 

Overall, it was a wonderful evening and Crudo was a great place to celebrate a birthday! My in laws found the menu a tad confusing at first but our waitress was good at explaining our options so crisis averted. Crudo is definitely as expected, a modern take on Italian classics! Their cocktails were very good as well!"}
{"text":"This place is one the best restaurants I've been to in while. Lauren was our server. She was gracious and helpful. Very quaint and intimate. Great place for a date or family dinner. We sat on the patio, candle lit with an ivy canopy. Laurent explained in detail the menu. I started with the chicken hearts. They were awesome, if you love the iron and mineral taste of blood. Not a fan but I gave it a shot. She quickly brought out pig ears instead which were delicious. I then had the octopus, staticatella, lamb neck gnocchi and lamb belly. All were amazing! Just go and eat here. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I swooned. And not just because it was a \"hot date\" night. Every detail in design of the menu and space was as perfect as I wish they could be! From the custom-created cocktail made especially based on my general description of what I like about my liquor to the home made mozzarella appetizer to the yellowtail and albacore crudos that had me grasping my breast plate in ecstasy, and the squid ink risotto that literally found space in my dreams... Crudo is the kind of restaurant that makes me love Phoenix's food scene. I don't wistfully pine for San Francisco or Chicago with service as engaged and attentive as our bartender and servers, food as creatively designed and excellently executed as our tasting menu, and decor as exquisite as the interior space. I think a Phoenix foodie's tragedy of life would be to miss this perfect space. As for the date, well, at least the food was fantastic -- CRUDO was worth the dress! ;)"}
{"text":"What a magical environment situated in the most unassuming area! Crudo sits in a small building in the back of the shopping mall on 36th and Indian School and this little wonderland makes you feel as if you've walked into a whole different world. Upon walking in, you're greeted by a warm and welcoming environment filled with romantic lighting, Restoration Hardware-like decor and plenty of inviting seating in three different rooms. It's the perfect setting for a romantic dinner date or a food-filled group dinner. 

We were with a group, so we worked with Chef Cullen and his staff on a pre-fix three course menu paired with cocktails. With each bite of this meal, I entered taste bud heaven. While sitting at a long wooden table surrounded by glistening tea candles, our first course consisted of Albacore Crudo paired with a vodka & gin cocktail with celery! I'm not typically a raw fish kind of girl, but this was definitely not something I could pass up! The tuna was tender, flavorful and delicious and the salty truffle and slices of apple added just the right amount of flavor. 

The second course was probably my favorite because it was such a unique twist on a simple concept. I saw that we were getting Burrata and tomatoes so I assumed it was your typical Caprese salad but I was wrong! This came out in a mini mason jar and you dug your spoon in to top the creamy Burrata and flavorful tomatoes on top of a buttery bread. I could have eaten two of these dishes quite easily! This course was paired with cocktail filled with Mason Rouge VS Cognac and was my favorite drink. 

The third and final course was hearty happiness consisting of Beef Brisket sitting on creamy and cheesy polenta. This was paired with a bourbon cocktail with a serious kick! The brisket was tender and filled with the taste you hope for in brisket. It was cooked to perfection and I gobbled up every bite. 

The setting, food and service was all excellent and I should note that while we had a pri-fix meal because of the size of our group, everything we dined on is on the menu so you can enjoy it too! The staff was great to work with when setting up the group dinner and I would highly recommend this as an option for a group dinner or if you want to wow a loved one!"}
{"text":"I had pretty high hopes for this place considering how well it's reviewed and the unique dishes they offer. The majority of dishes that our party of 6 got were on the disappointing side. The best things that they had by far were there appetizers. The burrata and ricotta cheese appetizers were really good. Along with that was the smoked olives and crispy pig ears. Olives had amazing flavor and the crispy pig ears were very unique yet delicious. The entrees are when it started to go downhill for the majority of people. I'll start off by saying that I actually really enjoyed my entree. I got the brisket and that was probably the best entree out of all of them. My sister got the pasta dish with fowl which had a really unpleasant flavor. Stay away from that dish. My wife got their risotto. It was just okay. I've definitely had much better risotto then this one. My parents got their fish of the day which was an ahi tuna and it looked just okay. The food was a little overpriced in my opinion so that also made the experience not the greatest. Service was good however. If I do come back, I will just get the brisket. You just gotta make sure you order the right thing here because if not then you may not have a great experience."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good a glass of wine paired with aromatic Italian cheeses and local bread on Tuesday!? My first time at this Italian bar / restaurant and I can only think about planning my next visit. My friend and I sat at the bar and the excellent bartender/waiter/cocktail artist made us tasty cocktails and was just the right combination of friendly and cool. It's happy hour Tues-Thurs from 5pm to close so we took advantage of this and got three tapas or \"small bites\"  to share and two drinks each. Crispy pig ears may sound strange to some, but this is probably the star of the appetizers and will have you wondering where those tastebuds have been and ready to order some vino rosso. It was cooked well, crispy, salty, with just the right amount of vinegarette and spicyness for the kick ....delicious. We also ordered the Grana spread and later the straciatella. My favorite was the Grana spread and the buttered and toasted noble bread that it came with. The Parmesan garlic and evoo mix is decadent. Though I wish I would have gotten wine first as t would have gone well with the bread and cheese. Instead I got a Whisky Sour ...not to sweet and nicely presented that I immediately forgot about my pig ears and began to devour my drink. My friend was nice enough to let me sip a bit of her Spanish red though. Needless to say I'll be going back to Crudo and hearing great things about their seafood selection, I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We sat at the bar (are you starting to see a trend in my reviews??) and the bartenders were cool. I ordered bartenders choice because i was feeling froggy. The bartender asked me some questions on my preferences and whipped me up something scrumptious. We had a few appetizers - I recommend the n'dja and the pig ears... super tasty, I'm not joking either! 

We will be back, maybe one day I will try and sit in the dining room."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with Crudo! The quality of the ingredients is absolutely top-notch, the combinations of flavors are very innovative and the atmosphere is very cool.

My initial concern was that the portion sizes may be too small for my husband, who refers to those places that serve a tiny portion on a huge dish as \"foo-foo.\" But Crudo is certainly not a \"foo-foo\" restaurant. The portions were perfect and absolutely worth the price. We also appreciated that not all the dishes were truly \"crudo.\" I enjoy the raw food thing, but I know not all guys are into it. 

The Squid Ink Risotto was absolutely one of our favorite. I thought the presentation and the flavors where excellent"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing and the staff is warm and knowledgeable. The ambience is welcoming and the space is simply yet elegantly decorated. 
The brisket is insane. The burratta is likely the best I've had. Yellowtail is always fresh and delish. Goat cheese and beets, wow. I can't say enough. As usual."}
{"text":"excellent stop. Just did happy hour.  Best crispy pig ears, great truffle bacon popcorn, get the grana spread,  awesome bread! Great happy hour prices.  Cool environment.  Good looking people all around!"}
{"text":"Mmmm. I went here for dinner with a few of my girlfriends and we all enjoyed the ambience and the food. They are labeled as a \"Modern Italian\" restaurant  and serve food that is very unique and different from other Italian joints.  Food was served family style so we got to try a variety of dishes. My favorite was the squid ink risotto and the raw albacore dish. Since it was a girls' night, we all had their cocktails which were all delicious as well. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a place to take a romantic date or just a night out with friends."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I went here with a large group (9) and the service was excellent. They were ready to receive us when we arrived and didn't make a fuss over the fact that 3 of my party members no-showed (we were originally 12.)

The cocktails were wonderful and not overly sweet. Definitely creative. My favorite was the Milano Gimlet. 

As for the food, I had the Butterfish Crudo, Squid Ink Risotto, Brisket, and an Apricot Crostada for dessert. We also had the Grana and the crispy pig ears for the table.

All of it was excellent and very fresh. I read a few reviews complaining about the portion sizes and, quite frankly, I don't know where you people put your food. I nearly needed to be rolled out of there.

The standout dishes for me were the Squid Ink Risotto, the butterfish, and the crispy pig ears. The pig ears were like big, chewy crispy pieces of the best bacon ever. The risotto was rich and flavorful as the was the butterfish.

I will definitely be back (seriously need to check out the brunch option.)

I almost forgot, someone ordered the Olive Oil Whipped Goat Cheese Grilled Beets for the table and I thought I had died and gone to heaven."}
{"text":"Great place, especially if you appreciate independent restaurants.  My wife and I sat at the bar and had a small dish and drinks.  Excellent, cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Crudo closed and then reopened at the strip mall next to Beckett's table and Acacia cafe.  The restaurant is adorable.  Bright, with chandeliers its like Modern Steak without the boob jobs.  The bar is tended by Micah Olson who is a sweetheart and the drinks, especially the \"rebel son\" are delicious.  They remind me of the drinks at Merc bar in its hey-day.
The menu is small, but everything is meticulously prepared.  If you are lucky they are also doing a $30.00 prix fix which can't be beat.  The focus is on impeccably fresh ingredients prepared simply.  i.e. if I were doing the cooking at home, but didn't actually have to you know, cook.  The standouts for me are the risotto which while technically not a raw item, helped to really complete and round out the meal for me.  Definately give it a try.  That strip mall is really turning into a food destination which I know, is totally surprising."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for recipes that contain ricotta so I totally lucked out when I came across Crudo because so many of their dishes have ricotta.  I had an excellent meal here.  The cocktail menu did not disappoint.  Super friendly service and lovely decor. I can't wait to go back this place is 5 stars all around."}
{"text":"Giving this spot a 3.  I like the space a lot.  I feel like with the concept it would be better 'cozier' if that makes sense. Like if there were more tables or something or just a smaller room.  But whatevs.  That has nothing to do with this review, just a thought. Anyways.  Seems like a great date spot or a group dining. They have some awesome looking private\large table spaces. 

Value. Good. Wife and I did the 4 course tasting so we could try as much as possible.  $45 a person was totally fair to me.  Coming from NYC, I felt it was a bargain.  Our server warned that the portions would be smaller, but as they came out my wife and I were actually surprised by how much food was on each plate!

Service. Awesome. The server was super knowledgeable and friendly. Knew the food and drink menu and definitely helped us make comfortable decisions.  Checked up in us regularly but not obtrusively. I would give this place 5 stars based in service, 

Booze.  Great cocktail menu.  Have the scotch baio and rebel son. Really tasty.  Mixed well.  Wife enjoyed her mezcal drink and wine (which our server helped her pick). I will definitely come back for drinks.  Perfect night cap if you want to end the night right. 

Food.  OK. I think the food just wasn't refined enough. I DO think they are on the right track though. So refreshing to eat something that's trying as opposed to all the places in phx that are burgers, tacos or pizza.  My four courses - crudo a little fishy, ricotta was tasty with the pear, risotto felt to wet and messy maybe it was BC we came after 9pm and the kitchen wasn't in their groove?, finished with the loup de mer which was good but felt like something wasn't complete about it.  Wife had - crudo was fishy, burrata was good but the sauce a little acidic, gnocchi wasn't anything to write home about, short rib was good.  

Again.  Not to sound like I'm pretentious, but I've had better.  But I do like where they are going.  I'll definitely recommend to people if they ask based on the service and cocktails we had."}
{"text":"One of the 5 best restaurants in Phoenix- Scottsdale.  First of all the prices are so reasonable for great quality food. They have 4or 5 totally different sections on the menu. You choose or mix and match. There is a raw fish section with choices of Albacore, ahi tartare, Hamachi Butterfish and Octupus  All great. The pasta with bits of Hen and topped with an egg.  Then it gets even better with the brisket and  marrow. The short Ribs, Pork Belly with creamy Polenta. Plus there is also a fresh market Fish. It's a must go. Oh and the other 4 IMO is Deseo, Sel, Virtu, and Roka Akor ( not the Sushi) but everything else. Happy eating. Trust me!!


It's good. But not as good as previous visits.
Menu does not change much
Too many rich foods on the menu.( pasta in cheese sauce, brisket,Pork Belly bone marrow)
All crudo's and various mozzarella' are excellent.
It's a bargain with 3 courses at $40
Order the pigs ears. An extra treat when you order your drinks.
Deserts are nothing much. No Espresso or Cappacino available."}
{"text":"Just do yourself a favor and don't judge this place by curb appeal.

I had heard good things, but purposefully did not look at specifics prior to showing up, and that was the way to go.

We went with our newborn and were promptly placed into one of their semi-private alcoves - which turned out to be amazing since it was close to a three hour meal.

There were four adults and we did the tasting menu so basically we tried almost everything on the menu... and nothing was a disappointment.

From the crispy pig ears (a 1st for me) appetizer, to the ahi + pistachio crudo 1st course, to the lamb neck + semolina gnocchi, to the best brisket I've EVER had, to the bites of dessert I barely had room for...

The service was spot on, the cocktails (I tried four of them) were amazing and I can't rave enough about this as an \"event\" type meal.  Come here to celebrate something - even if that something is a fantastic meal of things you probably haven't had before.

Seriously.  And don't change your mind when you pull into the parking lot and can't find it cause it's tucked in the back of a strip mall.  Enjoy, cause I sure did!!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for my birthday last week and it was a great experience!  Our server was very attentive, pleasant and knowledgeable. She brought us a prosecco toast to kick off the bday meal, which was really unexpected and set the tone for the evening.  My husband and I both ordered the coursing options, and we were not disappointed. The kitchen prepares each course with appropriate timing and importantly, size! The food was absolutely delicious, the lamb neck gnocchi was probably one of the most divine measl I've ever had and both the burrata and fresh mozzarella courses were amazing.  The only disappointing course was the raw couse, my husband ordered the yellowtail and it was a bit fishy. Otherwise, everything was totally delicious. Given how much food we ordered, the prices werent even all that high outrageous. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Once again, had the most WONDERFUL dinner with drinks last night.  EVERYTHING tasted FANTASTIC.....even the crunchy pigs ears!  NEVER thought something like that, would or could taste so DELICIOUS!  It's a DEFINITE MUST TRY along with house made smoked olives!  Couldn't have asked for a more pleasant and delicious night.....
LOVED LOVED LOVED the evening at Crudo's!"}
{"text":"I heard nice things about this place and people raved about the desserts made by Tracy Dempsey Originals that they have on the menu. I drove 30 min to get there to find out that they have not updated their online website which shows the Tracy Dempsey Originals dessert menu online. They no longer had her desserts which is the only thing I went there for. So not wanting to leave without a little food I ordered the smoked warm olives that cost 10$. I got them to go. When I opened the to go box at home I was shocked to find exactly nine olives?!?! Like really. Ridiculous. anytime I have ever been to a nice place that has olives on the menu weather they cost $5 or $10 it's usually and 8oz bowl filled up I mean for crying out loud, Nine olives. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"So NOT impressed with this experience.  Our hostesses was warm & friendly but then we got the condescending waiter.  We were a group of 11 savvy, out and about business women who know find food and good service.  Some of the food I had was fine but quite overpriced for what it was - like the burrata. And one of my friends did not get her food for an hour and a half after we sat down because the waiter explained that he doesn't serve it until it's \"third course\" time so she went home without getting her second course.  Here's the killer.  My friend's bill was $27 and mine was $81 because the waiter put the entire cost for the bottle of wine we shared on my tab without asking.  Yes - my friend was gone.  Three and a half hours later, our waiter explained that he was sorry for our dissatisfaction but he didn't know we were in a hurry.  Food was not exceptional at all and none of us shall return."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - MAGIC! - Rude)

Saturday evening jumped out to Yelp
And put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet
All the way to you

Came to your door with food in my mind
To order from your menu
Cause I know that you're in Restaurant Week, yeah

Can I have your Risotto for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll always get my blessing til the day I write
Good luck, my friend, but answer is Bo Bites

Why you gotta go to Crud...o's
Don't you know I'm hungry too?
Why you gotta go to Crud...o's
I'm gonna Bo Bites anyway!


Crudo's has had quite a reputation in the valley and needless to say I had to make my visit on Restaurant Week!  

The place itself is oddly located, but that didn't bother me much.  I came on a rainy Saturday night with my partner in crime.  She's the one and only @ssuze photo extraordinaire on Instagram!  She shoots the pictures and I write!

We both ordered the 4 course meal.  We started with the Albacore with Truffle Watermelon rind and black pepper and the Yellowtail, Controne, Bottanga, Chive.  Needless to say, I don't know what the heck it means, but boy was it a perfect start.  Eating sashimi with a kick of sweet and aromatic seasoning.  Next was the cheese dishes; Burrata-Pancetta Vin, Arugula and the Ricotta Walnut sauce, and Honey.  I would say this is my least favorite course since I'm not much of a cheese guy.  However, both dishes worked!  Sweet honey and creamy ricotta cheese mix over bread; who knew would taste great.  The Arugula gave the Burrata cheese a nice subtle taste.  Next was the entree round, we went for their famous Squid ink risotto and their pork belly smoked tomato Agrodolce Polenta.  I see why their it's known in town as the Famous Squid ink Risotto; definitely one of my favorites of the night and recommended.  Cooked to perfection the mixture of tuna, chilis, and tomatoes made this dish a spicy and sweet delight!  The pork belly was again cooked well, but didn't really do much for me.  We ended of course with dessert; Butterscotch Pot de Creme with Olive oil, Lemon, and Rosemary Shortbread and Chef Cullen's Bread Pudding.  The shortbread worked only with the cookie atop.  Without it just didn't give much texture and I mainly tasted only the Butterscotch.  The Bread Pudding well, it was bread pudding in the end.  Not much for dessert in my book.

Overall, the service spot on and top notch.  The place itself is classic and reminded me of some old southern style home.  Great ambiance and date place!  In the end, Crudo deserves my love and definitely a hot spot for me! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Gotta love Crudo! It had been a while and I was seriously craving some crispy pig ears (don't judge me!). I met a friend here Friday night for dinner and drinks to kick off the weekend right. We sat at the bar (always) and each ordered a Violet Femme {commerce gin | cucumber | violet | lemon | sparkling wine} served in a flute. Very yummy but definitely be careful if you order this as it can be quite dangerous! Of course I got the crispy pig ears and they were just as awesome as they have always been- perfectly crisp and chewy on the inside. The Fresno chili adds the perfect flavor! We also got the octopus crudo which comes with a garlic puree on top that gave an extra burst of flavor. Service was good as always, but could be a little friendlier. Our drinks were kept full and dishes cleared so it's all good.

In the past I've had their butterfish crudo, burrata, gnocchi, and pork belly- all of which I would recommend. I also want to check out their brunch menu that looks killer! I recommend Crudo to anyone who wants a cool place to go with great food!"}
{"text":"Excellent bar program. Probably one of the best in the city. Food was on point. Took my fiancee here for her birthday we both loved it. The crispy pig ears and squid ink risotto were fantastic. The crudo stuff was very fresh. Solid wine list. The only downside I can think of is the dining room feels bland and cold and the restaurant is in the back of a strip mall. Overall, a cool neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"I had a very interesting dining experience last night.

They serve a pig head and 72 hours notification required. They normally have a course meal price but if you order a pig head, that becomes your main dish for your table and you order appetizer and pasta separately.

Their wine list is not that extensive. Actually a little disappointed by selection. For the type of restaurant, I expected more but what they had was just okay. Bottle price was very reasonable, nothing on high end.

Pig ear goes well with beer. You can't tell that is pig ears, it was like crunchy snack. Uni was very tasty. Pig tongue was so soft. Burricotta was really good cheese, tasted a few more from appetizer, all was very good.

Pig head is nicely presented, cheek was soft and juicy, really enjoyed it. 

Tiramisu was quite good, Lovely ambiance, i enjoyed my dinner here."}
{"text":"Arrived, sat at bar and ordered drinks. We were planning on eating at the bar, but no one ever asked us if we wanted to order. Glass stayed empty for 26 minutes. Finally a different server asked if we needed anything. At that point we just asked for our check. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Talk about a beyond incredible experience with the most unbelievable service.  I don't know if I'm the only one that feels this way, but I'm just so sick of spending money on the same mundane restaurants that can be found on nearly every corner; ones that run more like corporations than friendly neighborhood cafes.  I am on a mission to find new places that are as unique as they are delicious and BINGO!  Crudo proved to be that place.

My boyfriend and I tried it a couple of weeks ago on a weekday when it was pouring rain outside so, lucky us, we had the already tiny place all to ourselves.  Our server (her name was Liz) was so friendly and knowledgable and took her time with explaining the menu to us thoroughly.  Not only did she rock, but the chefs were just as incredible.  In fact, the owner Cullen (I hope that's how you spell it) hung out with us and told us all about how he can make items that aren't even on the menu as long as he has the ingredients.  But I don't know why you would want to because his creations are so well-thought out and inspiring.  

So, onto the meals.  My boyfriend got the Butterfish, which was phenomenal and anyone that has tried it will attest to this.  And I decided to be brave and try something raw for the first time.  I had one of the tunas and, unfortunately, wasn't completely in love (not because of the dish but because I'm so picky).  Anyway, it didn't go to waste and boyfriend enjoyed it enough to eat that dish too.  He did say he preferred the butterfish though...in case you were wondering.  Anyway, I went with something more safe: the veal.  I would go back there every day to eat that.  Seriously, it was incredible.  It also takes a little longer to cook so the chefs made us a little something special (on the house) while we were waiting.  Did I mention how awesome everyone is that works there?!

Onto the dessert: BACON COOKIE!!!  I don't want to give it away and would rather you just be intrigued enough to go there and have one yourself.  Just know that it was so so yummy.

All in all, it was a wonderful night and we stayed and talked to the staff for nearly another hour after we ate.  But don't take my word for it (or do).  Either way, try this place for yourself!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here a couple of weeks ago and everything was great. There were four of us and we ordered crudo, meatloaf burger, I think I had mushroom risotto.., soo good. The drink I had was just so so.
 Can't wait to try dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  I waited a year to try Crudo and it was every bit as good as I hoped it would be!

Walking in I was immediately impressed by the minimalist decor.  Like the food it was crisp, clean and modern with touches of comfort.

We had drinks in the bar and I enjoyed the Rebel's Son cocktail with Bulleit rye whiskey.  So many of the cocktails looked great it would be worth another trip to just sit at the bar and try a few more different drinks.

Dinner was fantastic.  The service was friendly and very efficient.  I think the set price 3 or 4 course menus are the way to go.  You can order anything on the menu for your choices so you really can't go wrong.

We each ordered different things from two 3 course menus so we got to try 6 different dishes!  My favorites were the albacore with green apple and truffle oil and the pork belly on polenta.

For dessert we shared a chocolate pudding type dish with peanut brittle.

No wonder they were invited to cook at the James Beard house.  They are doing everything right at Crudo!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it continues to impress. The staples combined with rotating items / cocktails are always impressive. I definitely recommend ordering with the tasting options / pricing they provide especially if it's your first time. I generally do the 3 plate tasting and leave plenty full. Some of my favorite dishes include the pork belly, brisket, squid ink risotto, and any ahi or yellowtail Crudo dishes they have. Yum! Oh - and don't be afraid to start with crispy pig ears. At first I was apprehensive but after having them the first time I can't not order them if I'm there :)

The bar has plenty of options for any taste. I recently had a couple of gin drinks which were well mixed, balanced and generally delicious!"}
{"text":"Right when you walk in, you're hit with how elegant (modern elegant, not the stuffy white table cloth kind) the place is and then there's the wonderful smell of smoke from the wood fire grill. While it's beautifully decorated, I think the length of the table my boyfriend and me were given made it a little awkward and uncomfortable. He was more interested in the taco and burger place down the street but it was my birthday so he was obliged to follow. 

The service was a little bit on the slower side but it was a Thursday night so I'm sure they were not running at full speed. I'm fairly well-versed when it comes to food but the menu is a bit intimidating...lots of stuff I haven't heard of. We did the 3 courses option. 

Octopus crudo-3.75 stars. It was fairly tender but not the best I've ever had. The flavors developed more as I finished the dish.

Yellowtail crudo-3.75

Ricotta with walnuts and honey-4 stars. I love these flavors, it could've used a little less olive oil and more honey. 

Mozzarella with the caramelized onions/bacon/reduced balsamic-4.75 stars. Delicious! 

Brisket-4 stars. Except the portion is way too small. One tiny slice of brisket and I'm all for nice marbling but half of it was pure fat and inedible. They should switch out the radicchio with Brussel sprouts. Flavoring and tenderness were on point for the brisket.

Lamb belly with mash potatoes and broccolini-1.5 stars. The broccolini had a delicious smoky charred flavor. The the lamb however was gross. It was so gamey. I know that if you cook it right, or soak it in buttermilk before cooking, you should have an ever so slight gamey flavor. Or maybe it's just what my taste buds prefer. I had to spit it out in my napkin it was that bad. 

The place was kind of expensive ($160 with drinks and tip for 2 people) and I left a little hungry. I do think the restaurant is unique and it left me wanting to try more. That's the reason for the 4 stars. 

I hope to return"}
{"text":"A very creative approach to an Italian restaurant.  My wife enjoyed three of their dishes in a tasting menu style.  I had the yellowtail collar and a salad.  Everything was executed just right.  Broad wine list.  Expert and helpful service."}
{"text":"Best bar in Phoenix hands down!! Andrew and Keefer on a Tuesday night is like going to bar college... Most knowledgeable and caring bar experience I've had... Great drinks fare price and awesome staff.... Give them a try!!"}
{"text":"Recommended from a friend.  I have great friends!  Every bite was amazing!  3 for $35.  The raw items were better than any Sushi place in PHX.  I will be back here every time I come to PHX."}
{"text":"We went to CRUDO last week prior to an event.  I had mentioned that we needed to dine and leave by 7:00.  They were so accommodating to our needs.  The food was excellent, my husband had the squid ink risotto, I had the gnocchi.  Growing up 'Italian' I am used to home made gnocchi in a red sauce.  These gnocchi's were served in a white flavorful sauce that was beyond tasty and they were light and fluffy.  We also started with a delightful salad.  Having little time to 'wine and dine' a la CRUDO, we will be back for another full fledged dining experience.  Ciao, ciao and thank you."}
{"text":"This cute little restaurant is tucked away in Arcadia's Gaslight Square. Maybe it was the heart-shaped bike racks out front, but this place has a very romantic feel. Its entrance is surrounded by plush greens and when you enter, the interiors has a warmth to it. We came on a weekend for dinner and it wasn't packed to the brim, but it was definitely busy. I would recommend a reservation just in case!

For dinner, we were able to order items a la carte or as a multiple-course option for a set price. Few of us ordered the 3-course option for $30, which was a decent price given that one item could be $20. Items not included in the course offerring were the sides and drinks. Few of the antipasti items were an upcharge as well. I was able to sample a wide variety of the items, and I thoroughly enjoyed every single item I ate. Most notable were the ricotta, gnocchi, crispy pig ears. The ricotta was actually a little bland, but the honey and oil accentuated provided a great complement to the ricotta, thus unifying the flavors. The gnocchi was a perfect soft texture and flavor. The menu has one ingredient listed as \"creamed leek\" which may sound pretty boring but it was very rich and fulfilling. As for the crispy pig ears, we ordered this item out of curiosity. It was delectable, and one would not know he or she was eating pig ear. The pig ear itself was fried. It was crunchy and not too oily. It was topped with pickled peppers, mixed in a sweet and mildly sour sauce. Also, I ordered lamb belly. I'm not sure why I did since I tend to like lean cuts, but nevertheless, the meat I did eat was very moist and soft. Essentially, it melted in my mouth!

Our server guided us and provided recommendations through the entire meal. She was very attentive, helpful, and quick. I think my glass of water was constantly half full or more, never below. That's how good she was!"}
{"text":"When I own a home, I want my kitchen and dining room to be exactly like Crudo.

Guys, this is one of the best tasting menus in Phoenix.  For $35 you can choose three of ANYTHING on the menu.  So yes, if you want lamb belly, pork belly, AND brisket in one meal, you can have it.  YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL!  But you probably shouldn't, because obesity.

My boyfriend and I came here last night for a late birthday dinner and had an amazing time.  First of all, THEY HAVE FOUR KINDS OF PAPPY VAN WINKLE ON MENU.  FOUR.  Boyfriend really wanted you to know that.  Because that is really impressive. And if you're a bourbon fan, I've probably already sold you to come here.  If you aren't, let's move on to the food.

We both had the 3-course tasting menu. Crudo also offers four and five courses, but three was the perfect amount.  We started off with the yellowtail and octopus crudos.  The yellowtail was delicious, but nothing too unique.  The octopus was amazing and highly recommended!  I'm always hesitant to order octopus because when done wrong it chews like rubber, but this was not the case.  The octopus was so tender!  And the citrus oil really balanced the briny taste of the octopus.

For the second course I had the Gargati with mussels and uni butter.  This is a new addition to their menu and it is SO. GOOD.  I didn't really taste the uni butter, which might have been a good thing because the sauce wasn't overwhelmingly rich.  They sprinkle mint on top, which is great with the tomato.  Definitely going to be garnishing pastas like this at home.

For the third course I had the Market Fish and boyfriend had their Pork Belly.  You should definitely get the pork belly.  If you're worried your dinner will be too heavy, just get two crudos and the pork belly.  It was melt in your mouth delicious with the most buttery polenta.  I was so jealous boyfriend got to eat this and not me.

Service was absolutely amazing.  Their manager, Fran, came out to greet us with Prosecco for my birthday, which paired really well with the crispy pig ears (how can I forget to mention those until now!).  Bonus points: their dining music is your favorite Coachella playlist - Neon Indian, Yeasayer, Beach House.

Overall, one of the best dining experiences I have had in a while.  Next time, we're getting the whole roasted pig's head"}
{"text":"Crudo is the definition of a hidden gem.  This incredible bar/restaurant is literally hiding in the back of a shopping center, but easy to find once you know where to look... and for those that find it, you'll likely feel like you hit the jackpot!

Chef Cullen Campbell is known internationally and for good reason.  His creative menus along with cocktail creations from mixologist bartender Micah Olson are the talk of the Valley.  Now that I've been, I can say with confidence, that the Crudo experience exceeds expectations.  These local celebrities, along with Maureen McGrath Campbell (Chef's Wife) who runs the front of the house with ease, and the rest of the Crudo team have done a fabulous job with the space they are in.  I dined with a large group at Crudo last night and they took amazing care of us.  We had a cocktail paired dinner with three courses:

1st Course was Albacore Crudo with Green Apples, Black Garlic and Truffle Oil
*paired with Hophead Vodka, Damrack Gin, Celery Juice, Lime and Pierre Ferrand Dry Curacao

2nd Course was Burrata with Marinated Tomatoes, Pimentos, and Garlic
*paired with Maison Rouge VS Cognac, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, Cardamaro Amaro, Grapefruit, Lemon, Luxardo Maraschino

3rd Course was Beef Brisket with Pork Sugo, Fonduta and Creamy Polenta
*paired with Buffalo Trace bourbon, Cointreau, Reagan's Orange Bitters, Sweet Vermouth

All of the courses were divine - I couldn't pick a favorite when asked because I loved them all!  The first cocktail was my favorite.

The atmosphere is welcoming and the space is gorgeous.  The staff is extremely attentive without being annoying: spot-on all around.  They also did a really wonderful job catering to the dietary restrictions that certain members of our group had.  We sat on the restaurant side, but the bar was pretty happening for a Wednesday night.

I cannot believe it took me so long to get to Crudo, but it's definitely going to be a \"go-to\" moving forward.  If you're considering going, make a reservation asap and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was very, very good. I loved the a la carte selections, and it was difficult to choose entrees because they all looked and tasted so yummy. The atmosphere was great as well. Low lighting. Would make a nice date spot. But it was pretty pricey for me, all things considered."}
{"text":"Love this place! I hadn't been in a awhile and was looking for someplace to meet friends. I was a little worried about bringing in a group of 10 since they don't take reservations in the bar area and there's really only one table that can accommodate a big party. Luckily a few of us were able to get there right when they opened. 

Ethan was behind the bar and made me one fantastic aviation after another. He also introduced me to the chambong. I've never considered chugging sparkling wine, but the glasses are groovy and the tray holds two making it the perfect way to start the evening with a friend. Classy version of a shot? IDK, but it was fun.

Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely amazing meal there and the entire staff was warm and welcoming and fun. Amanda was our server and she was awesome! I don't live in Arizona but I will be back next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Rude hostess, pretentious wait staff, and mediocre food.  Great atmosphere but I will not be coming here ever again.  

Meal:  I had the gnocci, pork belly, and ricotta with honey.  Fiance had a salad (can't remember the name but was vegetarian).  We also each had a cocktail.  Again, I forgot the names of them - and yes, we only each had one and the cocktails are not the reason for my memory lapse!

Taste:  On the menu, the food selection looks exquisite and wonderful, but in practice, it was no more special than Fazolis.  The drinks were mediocre as well - lots of fancy cocktails but it had no value what so ever.  I suggest going to the Blue Hound in downtown Phoenix if you want fancy cocktails.  3 out of 10.

Value:  Awful value.  Our complete bill, without tip, was over $75.  I would expect an excellent meal for this price.  The portions were adequate but I didn't feel the food, experience or the portion sizes really worth the price.  2 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  The staff was incredibly pretentious and approached condescending.  The hostess was rude and combative.  She had the audacity to say to me (as I arrived at 6:30 pm) that the table we were being seated at was reserved for another group at 8 pm and they needed my fiance and to plow through this meal so that it doesn't disturb the other party's schedule.  1 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  It was a very nice atmosphere.  Nice, understated decor and the almost perfect lighting.  But you are periodically reminded that you are in an old 70's/80's strip mall.  3 out of 5.

Overall:  Go to Chelsea's Kitchen instead.  Crudo is not worth the price whatsoever.  9 out of 30 points, 1 out of 5 stars.  Awful."}
{"text":"Amazeballs.  My wife and I started from the interesting cocktail menu, our favorites were the \"Scotch Baio\" and the \"Buckberry\".  Next, get the Crispy Pig's Ears - which are out of this world!  Now I know why my dog like those pigs ears from the pet store!  We each went for the 4 course selection, and I chose the Yellowtail, Beef Heart Tartare (chef's special that night) Squid Ink Risotto, and Pork Belly.  All fantastic.  My wife went with the Ahi, Burrata, Squid Ink Risotto, and the Loup de Mer (European Seabass).  She didn't like the Seabass as much as the others.  Cherry and Chevre Strudel finished off the night.  Put this restaurant on your To Do List!"}
{"text":"Chris was our waiter, the guy was great. Exceptionally personable and helpful. Took a girl who doesn't go out to nice places often so she was more than confused and didn't like any of the food (not the restaurants fault) but she didn't enjoy. As someone new to Phoenix if you're looking for like a cliche pasta oriented Italian restaurant this isn't it. Leaving their spending $100 for two including two definitely didn't feel worth it. No matter who's salary. But I could just not have good taste who knows!"}
{"text":"Went to Crudo tonight to enjoy a night out for some great food and cocktails. We sat at the bar and Sam made our experience unforgettable. We started out with the burrata with pancetta vinaigrette and later enjoyed the pig ears and the pork belly with bone marrow. 


The whole experience from start to finish was amazing. Frances, the manager, was friendly and accommodating. Sam, our bartender, was attentive and help guide us through the menu."}
{"text":"I've visited the Crudo in Old Town and was really excited when the new one opened in Arcadia.  Visited with the bestie a nice quiet weeknight to enjoy some girl time.  You can get a 3 course meal for $35 and pick from salads, meats or what I would call side dishes.  It's a bit pricey for what you get portion-wise, unless you decide to order 3 meats..but who does that?  The wine is very reasonably priced.  The food is amazing!  Everything is cooked and seasoned perfectly, and presented to be delicious.  The decor is very simple, feels like you are in a big open warehouse.  It'd be a great place to have a group dinner for 6-10 as they have these rooms that are a bit more secluded they could put you in.  The service was a bit too good, to the point where we almost felt like she was rushing us even though there was nobody else in the restaurant.  

I'd visit again, but this is definitely a place to take another food loving girl friend- the boyfriend would be hungry and feel ripped off, it's just not his style..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a cocktail and were pleasantly surprised. Great cocktail menu and the bartender Lauren was outstanding!!  Excellent customer service and super friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food isn't all that great and our server didn't come around often to check up on us. Their cocktails were pretty good but that's about it. This place seems fancy but the execution is terrible. I'm not the type of person to complain about price but if a restaurant wants to serve very small portions and not deliver you bet your ass I'm going to give a bad review."}
{"text":"Everything has been fantastic on several visits, but the cocktails & mozzarella are standouts!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Eat here. 

I ordered way too much food, but that is my own fault.
Did not have anything I did't love.

Do you need anything else in a review?"}
{"text":"Had the tuna and the yellowtail sashimi and both were tasty... more because of the sauce/toppings vs the fish quality.  I thought the butterfish sashimi was the best tasting fish but the toppings were less interesting.  Had the burrata which was amazing!!!!  Great drinks too."}
{"text":"I've wanted to come to Crudo for awhile so I was very excited to eat here but left a bit disappointed. The wait staff was professional and efficient. The interior is pretty and the atmosphere is relaxing. I was very happy with my food but my husband didn't care for his pork belly because it was a bit stringy & not as unctuous as it usually is. I got the burratta, which came with nearly burnt toasted bread. The market fish was nice and light. The salad and desserts were perfect. I'd come back again but can't recommend it as a top restaurant in the valley....yet!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit to Crudo - the drinks were perfect and the small plates really were the perfect amount of food. I recommend the Pig Ear, I was against it at first, but we ordered a second plate.

The bartender was very pleasant and attentive - overall I enjoyed Happy Hour at Crudo and look forward to coming back and having dinner soon."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  A bright, fresh, seasonally and locally-inspired menu with lots of options - anything from snacks in the bar to a menu offering a la carte items, 3 course, 4 course, and 5 course tastings in the beautifully minimalist/rustic/modern dining room that is cozy and inviting.  

I dined with a party of six.  We started off in the bar and then moved into the dining area and all did the four-course tasting menu, which allows you to choose any four items from the entire menu (even if you choose to do all cheese, crudo, main or pasta courses).  Our party tried the albacore, ahi, and yellowtail crudo plates and they were all delicious, each quite unique, but equally amazing.  For the cheese course, most of us had the burratta, but one also sampled the fresh mozzarella.  Again, fantastic.  For the pasta, I had the gnocchi,  and others had the squid ink risotto (which was out of this world), and  the dumplings which had pork belly and butternut squash.  For the mains, half got the short ribs and the other half ended up with the pork belly.  We shared a seasonal fruit tart at the end.  Every dish was truly delicious and we left full and very satisfied, unlike some tasting menus.  

Really beautiful inside, so friendly and inviting, and really one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  A real gem and I'm glad we found it!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went to Crudo last night starving so I knew I needed lots of food! We came for happy hour at the bar. Luckily, it wasn't too packed and found a place to sit quickly. Hubby ordered the Dark and Stormy and I ordered the Daquiri - I must say, they make a \"mean\" cocktail! It was refreshing, sweet and strong, but not too strong. I barely can taste the alcohol but after a few sips, I started feeling a little too happy. 

We first ordered the Ricotta Mozza - it was delightful! It was gone in 2.123 seconds, I think. They only give you three pieces of bread, but they will give you more upon request. 

We then ordered the Ahi Crudo and the meatloaf burger. The Ahi was amazing - just like everyone said on the reviews I've read. The meatloaf burger wasn't that bad either. 

So here's the issue: I normally assumed that these three dishes would be enough to get full. Hubby and I normally share one burger at other restaurants, but this time, it wasn't enough! I needed more! I ordered one more meatloaf burger and finally, I was calm and ready to take a nap. 

For happy hour, our check was a little high - $62 plus tip for two. However, I loved every bite and every sip. The service was good as well."}
{"text":"Wow. What a gorgeous restaurant with such a delicate and sensational menu. \"Crudo\" means \"raw\" in Italian, and this unique spot specializes in sashimi. Who woulda thought an Italian-flavor inspired restaurant would feature raw fish? Not me, but I'm so so so happy that this is the case at Crudo!

We started with the Albacore sashimi, which I must say was my absolute favorite of the evening (and this wasn't an easy decision to make). But oh my gods... this dish is just exceptional. Thin slices of velvety albacore that completely melt in your mouth, topped with frail matchsticks of crisp, bright, green apple. Dotted with black garlic (who knew I could love garlic even more?) and truffle oil... this plate brings together flavor and texture in the most finespun fashion. Perfect. You must order it.

Next, we feasted upon burrata mozzarella (which always rocks) served from adorable little mason jars. It was paired with roasted tomato, pimento, chips of garlic, drizzled with olive oil, and served with fat slices of toasty bread (I skipped that last part and ate straight from the jar). So fresh, creamy, and clean. Delightful!

Finally, we indulged in the pork belly, which is covered in a rich tomato agrodolce and placed upon a delicious, perfectly-textured polenta. This meat has so much flavor you won't believe it... a simple and fantastic meal! 

Crudo also has an incredibly impressive cocktail menu and wine list that you must take advantage of. The staff is on point, helpful, and welcoming, and the atmosphere itself is quite \"crudo.\" Basic, spotless, dim, spacious. But the fragrance floating through the air is complex and full and tempting... this is truly a fantastic restaurant that I cannot wait to return to someday."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hours before or dinner reservation downtown. The restaurant is located at the back side of a strip mall. We were pleasantly surprised when we walked it! The bar side was cozy and I loved the decor. The server was personal and nice. Great drinks selections - cocktails were 7 bucks and I had a nice glass of rose for 5. Will return!"}
{"text":"I hate my birthday, I do mean hate here. Still my good friend insisted on treating me to dinner at Crudo for it.  Fortunately this place offered a positive association with that aweful date.

The menu was fresh and interesting, offering a lot of items I had never considered food (i.e. Squid Ink). Their menu is always changing so it'll often offer some unique surprises.

The most perplexing thing about the experience was that Crudo is tucked inside an upscale Salon (this also made it a little more challenging to find). This made the restaurant seem like more of a hobby for the salon, but if that's the case they're very passionate about their hobbies :)"}
{"text":"Extraordinary Night! Experienced Crudo for the first time recently with good friends. We went about 8pm. Seated at a fabulous table in a small room open to the main room and surrounded by charming french windows/doors. Awesome decor: a true \"urban\" feel, unlike many places in Phoenix. We walked in and all remarked that it felt like we were transported to LA, Denver or Chicago.

Maureen, fiancee to Chef Cullen Campbell, served an incredible selection of \"Chef's choice\" dishes to us that night...all sensational tastes and preparations.  Truly a remarkable experience all the way around. A must-go for those looking for a Chef-driven, food-inspired, urban experience. Thank you, Crudo! Looking forward to our next date with you."}
{"text":"I really try to not to overYelp a place....when something is stellar, the food speaks on its own without additional help. However, when a stellar place offers a new twist on their own theme..it deserves a new Yelp.  Today was the first time that Chel Campbell and crew offered a brunch.  It was extremely tasty and, from the looks of things, wonderfully received. Eggs vs. no eggs, side dishes...all were well conceived and served professionally and courteously (thanks, Frances!). Brisket, beet hash, poached eggs...or...how about pork belly, polenta, arugula, sunny side up eggs? A side order of Noble grilled toast and fig preservers...I mean really...  The fresh squeezed grapefruit  or orange juice was a nice touch...and the coffee was just killer.  This is a place where you look at the menu and don't see two or three dishes that look interesting....more like 8-10 things that would be interchangeably delicious. The breakfast freaks that we are, Peg and I will definitely make this a return stop. We are hooked on their dinner menu....and their breakfast items are definite  contenders for drugs of choice.  Thanks again, Chef, Maureen (of course!) and the crew.  Dr. B and Peg"}
{"text":"I went with the 3 course option and so did the partner. 
The service was awkward.  Our server seemed distracted and didn't show much enthusiasm about the food.  It felt like he was trying super hard to be in the present but never really made us feel like he wanted to be there.
The first \"crudo\" dishes were meh.  I had the albacore and it lacked flavor.  My partner had the ahi and it was much more palatable. I liked the crunch and acidity of the apple.
For our second courses, I went with the raviolo and my partner went with a grilled mozzarella (which is not house made).  Both dishes were packed with flavor. I especially loved the dates pared with the cheese.  The quail ragu was excellent. I loved the added sweetness of the carrots.  The raviolo was good, however the yoke was overcooked so when I cut into it I didn't get the bright-yellow gooeyness I was anticipating. 
I told my partner not to get the squid ink risotto, but he went against my judgement and got it.  The risotto looked like a bowl of motor oil.  He took three bites.  It tasted like poorly cooked tuna casserole. 
I had the pork belly.  The flavor packed into the tomatoes was amazing.  Loved it.  However, the pork belly was not executed well.  There was no sear, no crispness, so it felt like eating pure fat. I ended up cutting off the top and just scraping the tomatoes off to eat with the meatier bits. 
The crostada was a pleasant surprise.  My partner and I both agreed it was the best dessert we've had so far in our eating adventures.  The mixed cocktails were also wonderful.  We went with the Sun Also Rises and Grape Expectations (two of my favorite books). 
I really wanted Crudo to work out, but there were just too many details missed.  It was not consistent. The service could definitely improve and while the food has all the elements of flavor implemented, they need to take more time to execute it well."}
{"text":"So tasty! Had the four course including yellow tail, squid ink risotto, mushrooms and butter fish. Of the four risotto was a must repeat though all were tasty!"}
{"text":"Let me lay this out for everyone... To start, I am a fan of raw foods, I have my limits, but I have gone on fun raw diets just for the Ayurvedic pleasure of it all. Sushi is my favorite food, and salads are a great friend. So when I heard a friend of mine had a coupon for this restaurant, Crudo, I jumped at the chance! Three of us decided to go. 

Upon arriving to the restaurant/cafe portion of the building, there was no hostess stand so we just stood there for a minute until someone poked their head around and said \"Oh, uhhh just have a seat anywhere...\" and we sat outside since it was lovely last week. Then we waited for about five minutes for a server to come around. She was nice enough but seemed overwhelmed from the moment we came in although only two other tables arrived while we were there on a Thursday night... Not the best start.

The menu was explained to us very well, although she had to dash off and ask the chef a couple of questions in regards to the desserts for the evening when we asked... We also chose the 3 for $30 option. We decided on several menu items including an order of butterfish for each of us, then I got the tuna, and the squid ink risotto. My friends each got the seafood stew, and a mushroom/potato dish along with a fish I've never tried before, and a truffle/chicken heart something or other. 

The butterfish came after about 20 minutes of waiting and was extremely tender and buttery. The only other place I've had it is at Roka Akor and it did rival it, which is impressive. I could have eaten three orders of that. The mushroom/potato dish is the second best out of what we had, and then we had the squid ink risotto, which is so black it stains your teeth-- and is absolutely amazing.  I love risotto, squid ink sounds weird, but I was impressed. It added a slightly smoky flavor. The seafood stew was good, but the broth was  the best part of it because the veggies were so \"raw\" that it made them a bit difficult to eat. 

The courses were spaced out by about 30 minutes apiece which is difficult when you're feeling pretty hungers and there's not much there substantially in the meal. They don't believe in any sort of \"filler foods\" at the table or bring by anything in between like other restaurants of this nature sometimes offer. They have a small kitchen, though, so I suppose it's within their means. So, I give a 2 in terms of service, but a 4 in terms of tastiness level. I do think I would return if I am seriously craving some butterfish. :)"}
{"text":"hands down, crudo is one of my favorite restaurants in phoenix.  

everything on their menu is phenomenal. i highly recommend the ahi and the albacore; the fish is so fresh and delicious that i'm practically salivating just thinking about it.  

i've eaten in the restaurant several times as well as sitting at the bar for happy hour.  their bartender micah has got to be one of the best mixologists in phoenix, and will blow your mind with some amazing creations.  there's been many times that i've asked him to surprise me with a drink, and he's put together some truly delicious off-menu cocktails. 

i really don't have enough good things to say about this restaurant.  i took my mother here once when she was visiting from san diego, and she now insists that we go here every time she's in town.  so if you haven't been yet, go!"}
{"text":"the squid ink risotto was AMAZING!!! not your typical Italian restaurant where they serve red and white sauce pasta."}
{"text":"Well the ink squid risotto is still one of my favorite dishes in the valley.  And the ahi and yellowtail crudo, along with the short ribs are solid choices as well.  That said, the reason I no longer can consider this a 5 star choice is the service, more specifically the attitude of the 'co-owner.'  As other reviews have stated, there just isn't a very welcoming attitude and at times she came across as down right condescending.   (She probably shouldn't be working the front of the house....reviews would improve.)   Not sure that we will be back for dinner, although the bar side is still appealing on the quality of the experience and the great service and attitude on that side."}
{"text":"Loved this place. More people should know about it. Great cocktails. Had strawberry infused sparkling wine called dazed and infused. Menu divided into sections and raw food section had interesting selection of fish. I had hamachi special with watermelon radish and chiles. Cheese section had ricotta with grilled figs, burrata and others. Also enjoyed mushroom gratin with egg on top. Great service from winter, Cassidy. Cool space. Hard o ind in shopping mall. Look in back of parking area."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Pig ears are absolutely amazing. Pretty small inside and not too fancy, but I liked the atmosphere and the service is very good. Great for a date night but also a good place for just a random nice dinner. Very pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"We chose Crudo for a fun New Year's Eve dinner - There were 6 of us and we got our own little alcove in the restaurant. We felt so special!  The cocktails are FANTASTIC - some of the best in the valley and they have an extensive wine list.  We each did the four course option and it far exceeded our expectations - The portions were huge and the food was phenomenal.  This is a neighborhood gem, perfect for a date or celebration, and we will be back! *My favorite cocktail in the valley is Crudo's Rebel's Son*"}
{"text":"What a delicious and delightful dining experience! 

My husband, myself and another couple met for dinner on a Friday night. We were looking for something a little different and I was intrigued by all the great yelp reviews of Crudo so we decided to give it a try. There was a special wine dinner going on that night (which we did not partake in), so we were a little concerned that it would be really busy and loud. Unfortunately for the restaurant, it wasn't a problem. There were only a couple other tables the whole night. The restaurant shares a space with a little boutique, so the atmosphere was casual and a little funky- in a good way. The staff was friendly, helpful and very attentive. We took our time visiting and ordering slowly and we never felt rushed or neglected. It was still a bit warm outside, so we sat in, but I noticed a lovely patio that will be great once it cools down. 

We started our meal with the Local Farm Cheese plate and a couple glasses of good wine. Then we moved on to the rest. One of our party isn't into eating raw, so she had her own dish- the Mushrooms Au Gratin and was very satisfied. (She doesn't have a big appetite, so if you're hungry you might want to order another small plate to go with it). The rest of us shared 3 Crudos- the Butterfish, Albacore and Hiramasu and 3 Piattis- the Risotto, the Mushrooms and the Gnocchi. All were wonderful, but I'm still dreaming about the Butterfish and the Risotto! Portions are small, but high quality. The only negative is that it is a tad pricey, so I can't go every weekend."}
{"text":"I really, really, really have been and was looking forward to coming to this restaurant.  It didnt necessarily disappoint, but wasnt what i thought it would be based on opinions of others. Drinks were okay, the food menu was a bit hard to understand for a 1st timer, but the food was good. Definitely recommend the pig ears for a starter and the short rib for main course. Both amazing."}
{"text":"So impressed by everything here! The food was very innovative and so flavorful! I definitely recommend this place to people who love food. Definitely get the 3 course at least, and you will still be full. The server was so helpful on what to choose, and very accommodating. 

Their drinks are also on point! Had some classics, and some of their specials and all were perfect. I will be making this a frequent spot to eat. One of the best places in town!"}
{"text":"Went the other night. Sent back the Butterfish Crudo, warm, too fishy. Love butterfish sashimi, this was not good. Then I ordered the shrimp entree, good but small portions. The quail was fantastic. 

Service really went downhill after I sent back the crudo, it was as if I offended the waitress by sending it back. At billing time my itemized differed from what my card was charged. She had some explanation for the discrepancy, I politely asked for the correct itemized copy, which she seemed upset about, she decided to start waiting on other tables. Time goes by and we ask the hostess to see the manager. The manager comes over, tells us she will get the correct check, goes to the computer and walks away.

More time goes by...

We ask again for the correct itemized copy. 10 mins later? Manager comes back out, still chewing food from the kitchen and apologizes. We receive the check, a dismissive thank you while looking away from the table. 

We won't be back, over priced, rude subpar service, ambient room temp too high."}
{"text":"I went to Crudo with some friends for AZ Restraurant week and it was one of the best meals I have ever had.  I started with the Butterfish and it was really good.  One of my friends had the Albacore and said he also liked it a lot and another friend had the Mozzarella and said it was the best cheese he had ever had.  I had the squid ink risotto and it was amazing.  Dessert was good, but not great.  

The service was also fantastic and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Another terrific culinary adventure at Crudo last night. We opted for dining in Bar Crudo instead of the dining room. Good call since it was Halloween and we were treated to dinner and a show! Crowd favorite was the huge Smurf at the bar, complete with blue balls.
We started with a pre-dinner cocktail and the obligatory crispy pig ears. Between the three of us, our first course began with the Farm salad, butterfish and the yellowtail. My favorite was the butterfish followed closely by the farm salad. Lots of good fresh veggies and salad fixin's in the salad. Next course was ricotta with walnut, mozzarella with fig & balsamic reduction and the gnocchette (sp?). All of these were really well prepared. I'd order any or all of them again. Finally, we had the brisket, yellowtail collar and gnocchi with lamb. Once again, all worth a repeat visit. Another bonus is they aren't stupid expensive with the wine list. All reasonably priced wine which complement their cuisine. 
At $35 per person for a 3 course adventure, this place rocks."}
{"text":"I am finally getting around to reviewing Crudo.  What a great experience! We did the full tasting menu and were impressed by every dish.  Our server was amazing and passionate about every dish. The crudo dishes were my favorite - the albacore with black garlic and truffle was RIDICULOUS!  I'm still craving it!

I told our server how impressed we were and what talent the chef had...and jokingly I said, \"Is the chef  single?\"  We laughed our butts off when she said, \"well, he's actually my husband\"    I absolutely love the husband wife team making Crudo such a success.  You can taste the passion in their food.  Well done Chef Cullen and the entire team.  I wish you much success!!"}
{"text":"Well probably not much new to add but to say this is one of my favorite restaurants in town. Always great service, ambiance and food.  Been here a few times and always an amazing meal.   Referred some friends and they all sing high praises too."}
{"text":"Had a great, quick dinner in bar. Cocktails were really good!  Had a salad, brisket and some chicken with pasta dish.  Was fantastic. Highly recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch!  I'm not a foodie, so I need a bit of value and traditional satisfaction apart from hype and bias.  I was very pleased.  A bit pricey, but value is there.  I had the soft boiled egg, sausage and truffle \"To Start,\" and the pork belly poutine with fingerlings, gravy and fonduta \"Not Eggs.\"  I'll go back.  Craft cocktails and a cool bar area too."}
{"text":"Here's what we tried.

-albacore- I really liked it, hubby says it was
  \"great\"
-butterfish: Me - okay, hubby \"great\"
-******borretta-both thought it was so delish!!! ******
-risotto squid ink- me - blah, hubby -
  \"okay\". He proceeded to spill the ink sauce on his nice white button up shirt, the server got him some soda water, and amazingly it didn't stain! Crazy.
-gnocchi -me - blah,  hubby - \"okay\"
-pork belly- me - blah,  hubby - \"okay\"
-drink Penicillin: Hubby - \"too sweet\", I just don't like whiskey. :)

Overall, we thought it was fun and unique and fancy. Not a place I'd come regularly but a place I'd take out of town guests. The servers were great. It's a but dark in there so bring a little light if you are going with older folks :)"}
{"text":"I wish Yelp had a category 'fit for foodies' because I would put Crudo there. We all loved it and we ordered 8 different things. We got there early, sat outside and it was almost empty but the time we left it was full with a fun easy energy. We'll definitely come back our next time through Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am tempted NOT to post this because I don't want everyone rushing there and ruining it. I'm selfish. 

I was skeptical when I pulled up because it's in a strip mall. What IS it with strip malls here, anyway?  This is quaint, cozy, candlelit.. you get the picture.

I can only post about my bar experience, not the restaurant.  I have a bevy of visitors starting to flood in and we are planning a dinner here.

The bar has amazing speciality cocktails and an ecclectic bar menu.  Fried pig ears with jalapeno? Just do it. YOu won't be sorry.  Truffle popcorn with parmesean?  You really won't be sorry.  

The bar area is pretty small consisting of some nice cushioned high back chairs and a side table and a bar top area.  The bartenders were attentive and really helped us select from the drink list based on our preferences. I can't stand 'sweet' drinks and they steered me away from those.  I was intrigued by a tequila drink with grapefruit, but can't really drink tequila so they changed it to gin.  Delicious!  Speaking of gin, get the cucumber, cinnamon sugar concoction they have going on. It's insane. 

The hype about this place lives up to it!!"}
{"text":"First off, parking and entrance are in the back. 
Met up with a friend from out of town here for happy hour (5-7 pm). We had the pig ears, albacore Crudo, yellowtail Crudo, butterfish Crudo, burratta, truffle popcorn, and the seasonal salad (it was called something else but can't remember - it was the only veggie item on the happy hour menu). All were pretty good.  My favorite was the butterfish. Never had that raw before. It wasn't buttery when it's raw but still really good.  Heads up about HH though- the crudos (raw fish) aren't on special. It's still $12 like the regular menu. Good place overall. Will be back to try other things like the squid ink risotto every one writes about."}
{"text":"This might be a bit of a rant, but one very important part of this experience soured what would almost certainly have been a 5 star review and that's the bar.

When we arrived for our reservation our table wasn't quite ready, the hostess said it wouldn't be long, and we could wait in the bar and she would come and get us when the table was ready - cool.

When exactly did a bartender become a mixologist? It's not even a real word. Auto-correct wants to change it to seismologist or sexologist (what?). I'll tell you when; it's when the focus changed from making quality drinks quickly and efficiently for thirsty customers, to 10 minute \"preparations\" that include twisting basil and extracting elderflower. It's when the creation of the drink is more enjoyable for the bartender than the consumption by the patron.

This bartender takes his \"art\" way too seriously. The only thing that takes longer than getting a couple of drinks made here is how long it must have taken him to coiffure his beard and wax his moustache this morning. 

When we arrived in the bar, the solo bartender was muddling mint or basil or nettles or something, staring into space, imagining his next trip to Goodwill or what colour his next pair of Keds would be. No eye contact, no welcome, nada. He seemed oblivious to his surroundings, lost in his craft. By the time he honoured us with his presence, the hostess was back, ready to take us to our table. It had been 20 minutes and we didn't have a drink.

The rest of the evening though was fantastic! Amanda was our server and she was great. Engaging and knowledgeable, funny and entertaining. She started off asking us if we would like a cocktail, with the caveat that it might take some time - yeah, we know. 

Based on Amanda's recommendations we ordered courses and started with albacore and yellowtail crudo - amazing. So fresh and delicious. The burrata mozza was out of this world, the fresh mozzarella also very good. Squid Ink risotto was unique and worth a try. The semolina gnocchi was lighter than its doughy or potato brethren.The short rib was so tender it could have been eaten with a spoon - add the bone marrow to really move it to the next level.

We had dessert, but by then I was in too much of food coma to even remember what it was. Chocolate something, maybe?

All in all a very good experience. Would I go back? Absolutely. Would I skip the bar and go straight to my table next time? You betcha."}
{"text":"Go. Now. Creative cocktails, thoughtful and innovative menu, amazing service. Get the pig ears. Or don't, but definitely go. Equally suitable for a business dinner with a discerning client, date night, or birthday."}
{"text":"Great service, the waitress was very attentive and one of the dish that I ordered does not turned out to be what I was expecting, she immediately change my dish with other item in the menu. 4 course of meal today was fantastic. Definitely a place to go next time"}
{"text":"Crudo is one the best restaurants in Arizona. The have one of if not the best bartender in Arizona. My girlfriend who is an avid cocktail connoisseur swears they make the best drinks. Our favorites are Micha's (the bartender) Mai Tai, French 75 and their Manhattan. They have a great happy hour that you can actually make if you work longer hours at work. If you are looking for a date spot or just to have an amazing drink Crudo is the place to be."}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting restaurant. The atmosphere is nice, and we had a groups of 6 that had dinner in the bar area. The menu was a bit confusing, and mainly consists of over priced small plates however the food itself was good. I ordered the gnocchi, however I was served the pork belly with polenta and didn't realize until I was about halfway through the meal. It was very good, however not what I originally ordered. I would have said something but it was the same price and still good so I let it go. The drinks are VERY tasty, I had the buckberry and it was very refreshing. The bartenders are awesome here and really nice. Some of the group ordered the squid ink risotto which they described as bitter and fishy. The cheese assortments were good as well. The building itself is kind of hard to find if you don't know it's around back. Overall, I would return for drinks but not food."}
{"text":"One of my favs!! The yellowtail is pure perfection. The barata covered in a pancetta vinaigrette melts in your mouth. I highly recommend this place. Great wine selections too. Food took a little long but that is okay cause then you can have more wine;)!"}
{"text":"Went for nice dinner.  Overall no complaints but I thought it would be better.  Had several things suggested by our helpful waiter.  My main dish was the pork belly with added bone marrow.  Both very good.  I think bone marrow is better if the bone is cut long ways to make for easier consumption.  It's a nice place and the drinks were the highlight of the experience."}
{"text":"Crudo, what a disappointment!
Bar and ambience are cool, but once I set down to the table my enthusiasm was switched off: they say that is Italian but of Italian there is very little in that menu.
I've taken the Semolina Gnocchi and it was a little little portion of polenta with some lamb.

My friends taken the 3 course, so my fiancè and I needed to wait one hours (one hour!) to have ours, we waited them to have the last of their courses! What if they chosen the 5 courses????!!!!! Come on..

Some of the things were good, other things no, totally no."}
{"text":"My go to place right now. The food is imaginative and inspired--not to mention delicious. The cocktails are some of the best in Phoenix. the risotto in squid ink-exceptional! They have  a great Sunday brunch too."}
{"text":"We showed up near closing and were lucky the kitchen was still serving.  Being almost the only patrons, the service was full-on excellent.  My friend had the Guinea Fowl which was rich and satisfying.  But I must say that the dish taking the Grand Prize at the table was the Pork Belly on polenta.  Oh my, the conversation stopped when bites were taken. They are doing something right here and I look forward to visiting again.  You should too."}
{"text":"Smoked olives- Looked great, but I wanted to save room for mozza and griglia menu items! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crudo-phoenix-2?select=-0XG_gn3NAyh2BllGwAbIA

Grana spread: Loved this!  Really loved the granular texture, and the flavor and feel of the olive oil.  Might've been the only one who did.  Can't blame my friends... the other plates were quite scrumptious!

Crispy pigs' ears:  My first time trying this-- why did I wait so long???  These were wonderful!  Like chicharrones, but with meat, and the sweet peppers gave this dish a sweet kick!

Fresh Mozzarella, with bacon relish and caramelized onions.  Good, but would've been better if the mozza was a little more tender/silkier.  Bacon relish was the superstar in this one.

Straciatella, with battuto (root-based pico), hazelnuts, and radicchio.  I enjoyed the crushed hazelnuts over the creamy mozz.  Had to avoid the battuto due to carrot allergy.

https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crudo-phoenix-2?select=WzBcYltmikyduBWCyVvGIw

Ricotta, with walnut sauce and honey.  Another favorite of mine, for I am a lover of fresh ricotta that's well-made.  And walnuts.  And honey. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crudo-phoenix-2?select=Dz9DxRl2e94VzEHvxjxwQA

Brisket, with fingerlings, raddichio, and collatura ($19), with added Bonemarrow (+$5).  Found the brisket to be a bit too salty.  Fingerlings were excellent- crispy skin-on exterior, and fluffy interior... simply magical!  Really appreciated the bone marrow presentation (whole, uncut), which had a lot of meaty marrow that didn't make me feel like I was eating foamy oil on bread. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crudo-phoenix-2?select=HUGs_MRx5lKquEWRE5F8Pw

I had a two glasses (OK, a glass and a quarter) of the pinot noir on the happy hour menu.  Was able to sample this and one of the cabernets, and I surprised myself by favoring the pinot more.  The cab was a tad drier than I liked.

Yes, I want to return again soon.  Very, very soon.  Big thanks to Chef JK for recommending this place to me months ago, even though I'd had it bookmarked for years.  Why did I wait so long???

p.s.  Thanks to friends JY and DK for meeting me here-- what a fun evening!"}
{"text":"May have been one of the best meals I've ever had. Came here with a group of girlfriends and we started with the crispy pig ears, smoked olives and burrata, all were amazing I only wish the pig ears were bottomless. We each went with the three course option and everyone thorougly enjoyed what they had (I'm going to do my best to remember everything). I had the Yellowtail Crudo, Squid Ink Risotto, and the Brisket - Definitely Add Bone Marrow. The yellowtail was fantastic, however, my friend got the octopus which I tried and I definitely wish I had ordered that as well. The risotto was great, definitely enjoyed the flavors, it was my first experience with anything squid ink and was thorougly surprised. My final course was the brisket which made me sad the meal was coming to an end, it was so fall apart melt in your mouth, another first for me was the bone marrow and I think just the one time has made me an addict, definitely worth the add on. There was plenty of marrow for each of us to have some, and a little extra for me at the end. Other orders included the gnocchetti, semolina gnocchi, lamb belly and pork belly, nothing but good things were said by everyone post meal. We left without having dessert, but topped the dinner off with a digestif, I can't remember exactly which liquor it was, but it was recommended by the hostess and was the perfect end. I will definitely be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. We went with another couple on the weekend. We had made a reservation for four a week before. Despite having reservations, we were given a terrible half-booth/half-chair table in the corner right next to another table with a couple who were clearly annoyed by being so close to us. To sit on the booth side, at least one person had to slide sitting down along the right angle booth. The server had to squeeze into the other side to get orders, with her butt literally right up on the couple next door. Unnecessarily shitty table, and we got it. There are, however, a floor full of normal tables. Redesign. Food was so so. Portions are too large for the 3 course option. The recipes are really gimmicky too: lamb belly, cockscomb, etc. My wife got ill from her food, which she thought was undercooked (she got the pasta with hen). The fun drinks are all overly sweetened. Might as well substitute one for another. Service super slow, for both good and for drinks."}
{"text":"Happy hour was our first visit.  @ 6:45 pm, hardly anyone was there.  By 7 pm, they were full, which adversely affected our service.   Great vibe in there.  Love the meatloaf burger. However Brisket was dry & without flavor.  They offer a narrow bone - my dog loved it!  I'll definitely go back for the ambience & to try other menu options.  Just wish they had better service during Happy hour."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience. Very random that the restaurant is located in the gift shop of a salon, but once you take a bite of the food you really don't even notice or care. The Chef cooks in an open kitchen which I love and the server was great. My bf ordered the 5 courses and I ordered 4. It was perfect for the two of us. We split everything so got to try a good majority of the menu. We loved it all! Definitely check it out soon!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience. There were five of us and what a great evening.  The drink menu had a unique wide ranging set of choices.  All of the selections were quality and use some very special whiskies and liquors. Each of them were very good and a great way to start the evening.

The service was very attentive and efficient.  We were looking forward to a relaxed evening and the pace was perfect.

The food was excellent, we had a wide range of items, the ahi tuna was our favorite choice, the short ribs were exceptional each choice we made was delicious.

This is one of the top places in Phoenix.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying the food, cocktails and our server were great. My friends and I went to dinner last night and had a great time until it was time to pay. The internet went out and we asked for our check at around 9pm. 40 minutes later we were finally able to pay. Our waiter was busy figuring out how we could pay so he didn't check-in with us, no managers checked in and no one offered us even water while we waited plus he had our cards so we couldn't leave to pay later. He also attempted to take down the #s of our cards and we didn't see him rip them up after the internet finally came back on. In the end we spent around $230 plus a 20% tip and nothing was comped. Again our waiter was great and food was super good but our experience was pretty poor and I wouldn't recommend them. Part of paying higher prices is to relax and enjoy your time at the restaurant which I can't say we did this time."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here to try out their happy hour menu (5-7 P.M. Tues-Sat). The happy hour menu seems to have changed a bit from the online version since they took off their crudo selections. The only discounted menu item I ended up getting was the crispy pig's ears ($5 during happy hour). I also had the abalone crudo ($20) and bone marrow. Note that the bone marrow on the menu is only listed as an add-on with the brisket for $5 but you can definitely request it on its own for a little bit more ($8).

The crudo came out first. It was a delicate plate of sliced abalone, marinated celery, and thinly shaved carrot. The flavors were crisp with an acidic bite and I liked all the different components when eaten together. For that reason I wished there were more shaved carrot in the dish to go with the celery and abalone instead of two pieces. The abalone itself had a mild, slightly sweet flavor.

The bone marrow and crispy pig's ears came out next. This was my first time having bone marrow, and while I appreciated that they offer it, it had a very neutral flavor, like eating pure buttery fat spread onto toast. The toast slices themselves were plentiful, but I didn't like the actual bread. It was very hard in some parts and overly chewy in others which made it hard to appreciate the flavor of the bone marrow when all I can think about it how unappealing the bread was. 

The crispy pig's ears are one of Crudo's most popular dishes but apparently they were having an off-night when we received our plates. The sliced fried bits were very hard. Flavor and texture wise it was like eating the tough, thick pieces at the very bottom of a chicharrones bag that you can buy at the grocery store for a dollar. I did enjoy the spicy piquant sauce it was marinated in though.

Service was friendly but slow to take orders and drop off checks; drinks were refilled as needed though. They also forgot to split our check and we had to remind them but that's a minor point.

The actual restaurant is set in a scenic, hidden section of this shopping center. I actually turned into the part of the plaza that faces the street, where Nook is, but the large Crudo sign I saw actually said to head to the back area. This part of the plaza unfortunately doesn't have great parking options as compared to the front since the back lot is smaller, the road is a lot narrower, and you have to be very careful driving around since there are runners going back and forth along this lot.

My total was $40+ with tax and tip with no other drink than plain old water. Even though I had spent a decent chunk of change on food my stomach felt like I had only eaten half of an appetizer. Granted, abalone is a high ticket, hard to procure delicacy so I know half my cost went into this rare seafood menu item, but the cost, with inconsistent food and service don't really inspire me to want to come here again with gusto."}
{"text":"This place is one that truly deserves 5 stars. My wife and I both got the 3 courses. Each of our dishes were great but the one that stands out the most was the bone marrow! Incredible! Each if the dishes I ordered was like the chef knew what I liked better than I did. The drinks are great as well. I had the \"no name\". I would love so meet the the chef and bartender of Crudo. I am very impressed with their work."}
{"text":"I'm torn with this review because Crudo used to be my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix til the last time we went with a group of 8. In the past, the drinks & food have all been phenomenal. Loved the crispy pig ears, all the crudo plates (since I love raw fish!), and their squid ink risotto was delish. A great space too.

The last time we went though was a major fail on the food. The drinks still held up strong (thus the 3 stars), but the crispy pig ears were soggy & super oily, and the raw fish smelled & tasted horrible. How could you serve unfresh fish raw? If you know the fish ain't good, don't offer it. Or change the menu and cook the fish so I can't tell that you're serving me fish you got last week. 

Because of these bad dishes we were served (which was kind of embarrassing since I was the one who suggested to everyone we eat at Crudo), I don't think any of us want to go back. This was in early summer and we haven't been back since. Sorry Crudo - you seemed to have loosened up your quality control there."}
{"text":"Delicious. Came here for a happy hour after work and all of the apps were amazing. I wish I could remember the name of these doughy balls with butter and herbs. So good. Amazing cocktail selection and I definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"Crudo is such a beautiful yet simple hidden romantic gem corned in the back of shopping area. From the minute I walked in, I was impressed with the modern decor dim lighting, and warm atmosphere. My dining companions and I sat at a long dinner table and enjoyed an incredible 5-star 3-course dinner paired with exceptional cocktail concoctions prepared by an impressive mixologist. Each dish was beautifully presented and had several complex unique flavors that really encouraged me to savor every single bite. The Albacore Crudo was my favorite. Its soft texture combined with the crunchy sweet apple was just as lovely to eat as it was to look at. Pair that with a winning celery cocktail and the words crisp, light, and refreshing come to mind. Other notable dishes included the Burrata and tomatoes and a savory beef brisket plate which seemed to be a group favorite.

The service was inviting and hospitable, and it added to an overall flawless dining experience. If, and when, I am back in the area this place is a no-brainer for delectable dishes and unique cocktails. If you live here and are looking for a perfect unsuspecting place for date night, this is your spot. From start to finish, a memorable experience. Thanks, Crudo!"}
{"text":"This out of the way place is worth searching for. Tip:go to the back of the building.

I've been three times and have loved it each and every time. I tried something different with each visit with the exception of the yellowtail, which I had all three times....and it never disappointed!

This restaurant would be great for a date night or a night out with friends. Not much of a place for kids, which is not a bad thing as far as I'm concerned. :)

Try what sounds good to you on the menu. I'm sure you'll like it."}
{"text":"My friend brought me to Crudo for my birthday and it was a really great experience. From the moment I walked into the entry way I got a feel for what to expect from the restaurant. Theres great attention to detail in the design of each component of the restaurants design. The same attention came with our waitress who walked us through the menu. 

We got the butterfish crudo which was really good. The fish itself was great, fresh, clean, well cut. The lemon vinaigrette and olive oil combination was great, specs of salt really brought out the flavor. The tomato was a little strong compared to the subtlety of the dish but overall good pairing. 

Next we each had the squid ink risotto. Generally when I hear squid ink I'm excited, I hoped that the ink was used when making the pasta itself but it was more of  a component in the reduction of the sauce. Cooked very well, one of the best technically cooked risottos i've had in this city. Basil was a little strong, but if you like basil it would have been perfect, it did compliment the tomatos well. 

Last for our entree we had the short rib and the pork belly. The short rib was good, it wasn't my order so it wasn't my taste. Good but not a once in a lifetime dish. The pork belly however was amazing, I was left wanting to eat a giant slab of it. Really good, its what you'd expect from pork belly in any 4 star or michelin star rated restaurant. The polenta was good, above the bar. 

Desert was a mixed bag. We had the vanilla bean panna cotta and the tiramisu. The panna cotta was good, the grape instead of the conventional berry was a nice touch, the sea salt and the crouton took it to the next level. The tiramisu was the only dissapoint dish of the night. A lot of places are putting desserts in jars, its fun but I think the vessel led to the idea of deconstructing this conventional dessert which brought attention to each component which could have been good but didn't work out that way. The base tasted like chocolate mouse which I love but isn't a tiramisu. Overall it wasn't too sweet which is great but a good tiramisu usually has a splash of acidity for balance. 

Overall really good restaurant, really good food, pricing, staff, service, etc. Great for special occassions or someone special."}
{"text":"What an eclectic menu! I felt like a judge on one of those high-end cooking shows. From the bone marrow and uni risotto appetizers through the fantastic pasta course to the lamb belly main course it was delightful. I recommend the tasting option where you c pick any 3 or 4 items off the menu. The waitress was very knowledgeable and good at explaining the different dishes and offered good suggestions."}
{"text":"I tried pig ears and they were so damn good. Actually everything was good. Service, food and the establishment all complimented each other very well. Just need that Fresno chili recipe and I needed it yesterday"}
{"text":"Great place to bring someone. Make reservations though.  If not  wait can be long.  Service was good after the wait. Food was well worth the wait. Had crispy pig ears  squid ink risotto and pork belly.  Risotto was flavorful and pork belly is just amazing.  You gotta eat here."}
{"text":"Loved the place, ambience was amazing, very intimate. We went there for a small bday celebration, the place was fully booked so we sat by the bar, which had tables and everything, so we still had privacy! I really liked their drink menu, service is awesome the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because of their very limited menu, the appetizers were mouth watering, we ordered the albacore, yellowtail, ahi and the grilled bread (must have for bread lovers ), but when we were looking at the main courses every meat dish was made with pork, the only other option was the market fish! I didn't mind , I always get fish but my husband is a meat lover and we don't eat pork, so he had to get the fish! For dessert their chocolate mousse was amazing!"}
{"text":"Went in for drinks and dinner. The drinks were amazing!  I told Spotty I wanted something with whiskey and let him take over. Each drink was delicious. 

Drinks= amazing
Crispy pig ears= amazing
Any of the raw items= amazing
Dumpling with pork= so delicious I want to just keep it in my mouth and not swallow it. It was heaven in my mouth. 

I will be back soon. Found my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Say what you will about Arizona Restaurant Week -- the crowds, the not regular diners dining out, etc., but it got us to try Crudo, and wow, will we be going back. 

First, some location observations -- hard to find since there is not good signage on Indian School. Second, lovely upon walking into restaurant but what is the very strong smell of wood smoke? it dissipated as we went into restaurant, but still odd. My date and I were not seated at an empty booth for two, but by a table of 10, and a table of 6, where a young couple with their baby came in shortly after we started eating. Really folks?  I get that you want to have a life once you have children, but don't bring your fussy, crying one year old out to a finer establishment at 7 pm. on a Saturday night. I work too hard to earn my dining dollars. Get a sitter or stay home. (okay, enough soapbox). 

waiter was friendly, was great about explaining the wine and the dishes. here's what we had:
*albacore crudo with apples,truffle,black garlic -- one of the most amazing dishes I've ever had.
* butterfish crudo with tomatoes, arugula - also outstanding
*Mushroom-mozzarella,truffle,egg -- a great melange of various mushrooms, melted mozz, truffle oil and a fried egg. heavenly.
Short Rib-grilled root veg,mashed potatoes and horseradish -- comfort food elevated to a new level.

dessert -- Tracy Dempsey's flourless chocolate cake with hazelnuts -- creamy, decadent. in fact, i'm going to go finish my leftovers of it now and dream of next time I can get back to crudo."}
{"text":"I'm from LA, the land of good american tapas type of places. And this place lived up and exceeded my expectations. The service is great. The server explained every single dish on the menu. She answered all questions in an informed way. The prices were reasonable. $45 for any 4 menu items. The food itself was amazing. I really enjoyed the brisket. That one stood out to me although all sashimi was great too. The ambiance was romantic. Lots of open space in the restaurant so you never felt too sardined in or have another table's conversation interrupt your own. 

I got to say, it was really a great experience in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We went Saturday night 9pm and had a reservation for table for four. We found the food was very good... the gnocchi and the risotto were excellent but menu was a little tricky. There's not a lot of entree choices so can be hard for pickier eaters. For example that nite, besides the antipasto and pasta courses, there was lamb belly, pork belly, fish or brisket.  Also I told the server we were there for the staycation three-course special summer price but evidently she didn't tell the waitress who rang up the bill. We did not notice we were not charged correctly until afterward (blame the excellent rose'). So came to 4 ppl @$40ea for 3 courses +$40 btl wine."}
{"text":"Crudo, Crudo how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:

Butterfish with lardo and lemon
Albacore with truffles, apples and black garlic
Squid Ink Risotto
Pork Belly enough said
Short Rib with root veggies

Each dish was amazing, an orgasm for the tongue. I didn't want it to end. I could have stayed and ate for hours. Charming building, awesome set up... And the cocktails, ohhhh the cocktails. The modest monk and daring dutchman were crafted to perfection. 

Cullen Campbell has done it again and having Micah Olson behind the bar was a brilliant combination. This place is a \"must try\" and reservations are recommended. Last time I was there I forgot to make them and the wait was over an hour (and worth every minute)."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at Crudo with my husband. The 3 course menu was perfect to experience the variety of flavors offered at this restaurant. The homemade cheeses are out of this world! Wine selection is fantastic and we very much enjoyed the atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Ok this is looong overdue. What can I say about Crudo besides it is amazingly delicious and anyone who enjoys top quality dining should go here. I have been here twice in the past few months and had a wonderful experience both times. Crudo is nestled in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale in, of all places, a salon. Since I have never eaten in a salon, I really didn't know what to expect, let's just say, you cannot even tell there are hair styling or other spa treatments going on behind closed doors. The first time I went I gave the creative chefs full control over what to serve me. I think this is the best way to get a feel for the establishment and, by the way, how many places can you go where you actually get to converse with the chefs? Not many in my experience. Okay, so I gave them the reigns to impress me and they sure did. I had various crudos. Albacore, tuna, butterfish, and snapper were superb and unlike anything I had ever had before. Usually I am reaching for the soy sauce and wasabi, but this small plates of raw fish are delicately marinated and presented with extraordinary compliments like Meyer lemon, truffles, apples, olives, etc. Each dish is unique and delectable in its own way. I think the tuna is my favorite for now, but that may change since the menu is ever evolving, which is a definite sign of chefs who know what they're doing. More points of excitement included an appetizer that had a quail egg and truffles on it. An extreme mushroom creation that also had an egg on it was fabulous. Salads were flavorful and fresh. Risotto was delicious and the gnocchi was melt in your mouth orgasmic. Hmmm, I have to say that everything was great including the table service and wines selected. Crudo has specials (We went for Industry night, half off food) and they also have wine tastings that I need to go to.This is definitely the subtle spot for fine dining without the price tag or snootiness and if you know Scottsdale like I do, that's almost impossible to come by."}
{"text":"Excited to see this new cafe inside a hair salon in old town. I'm always into eclectic, quirky, nouveau and this is certainly that. Wasn't sure if we would have our own menu that nite ; Owner decided price fix menu for our pre-arranged event so the excitement built up for the last 2weeks.... i tried all the unusual beers from the counter where you can watch the chef's. Its interesting here. Check it out."}
{"text":"1st time dining at crudo. Our waiter was awesome, very knowledgable. I wish they had more vegan and vegetarian options, but I sort of expected that. Out waiter said that if we call ahead next time they could make something vegan. We both got the 3 for $35 options, started with the bread w parm oil and had 4 (amazing- get the jalapeño or violet femme) drinks between the 2 of us. I started with the \"farmer\" which was a salad, sort of was hoping for more of the veggies I saw elsewhere on the menu (fingerlings, broccoli, etc) but it was fine. Next I got the albacore which was INCREDIBLE. I actually got goosebumps. Last I got the grilled squid with cannelloni beans, it was really good also, ate every bite. My date on the other hand was disappointed. He did love his first raw butterfish dish. Then he got the squid ink risotto which he disliked and felt was too heavy, I tried and and disliked it also. Last he let the waiter choose who got him bone marrow and brisket. He hated both. I'm only giving 4 starts because there was a 15 minute gap between courses, it was sort of ridiculous and awkward."}
{"text":"I love Crudo's brunch!  If it were a little closer to home and a little cheaper, I would probably be there every Sunday.  I had the bacon risotto for the first time a few months ago and was hooked.  It is one of my favorite brunch dishes ever!  I've never had anything bad there, but the risotto is definitely my go-to.  Their dinner menu looks amazing, and I fully intend on trying it, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.  My only complaint is that it took a fairly long time to get drinks this most recent time.  Overall, though, I have always been very happy with my experience at Crudo!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of great restaurants over the last few years, but Crudo finally tipped the scales to propel me to write my first Yelp review.

In short, Crudo is a must-visit.  I was on a business trip to Phoenix and found the dining choices somewhat limited for the size of the city.  I looked through some of the local Yelp reviews and settled on Crudo for the sake of interest.  (I like taco joints and steakhouses as much as the next guy, but Phoenix appears to be clogged with them)

A colleague and I got there a little later on a Saturday night and were surprised to be seated so shortly (during Restaurant Week no less!).  After a quick round of \"Midnight Bramblers\" we ordered our food.

I'm not going to outline our entire meal, but try to express WHY it was so good.  Chef Cullen Campbell definitely knows how NOT to crowd the tastebuds.  Everything I ate exhibited a nuanced balance, not unlike the service, decor and cocktail menu (the Gimlet I had on the second night was perfectly, deliciously different).  

Oh, and the service needs some of the spotlight here too... we spent most of our night talking with the insanely busy, sometimes-hostess, sometimes-server, part owner Maureen.  She somehow balanced all of her duties with a natural ability to deal with a bunch of East-coast loudmouths - and made us feel more than welcome to cut loose.

That's the thing about Crudo... It looks, tastes and smells like it should be a stuffier upscale place, but it couldn't be more fun to eat there.

Keep up the good work Team Crudo, and let me know when you're opening a Philadelphia location!

{"text":"Came on a Wednesday evening and the place was dead.  After looking over the menu, we decided on the 3 courses for $30.00.  Be warned, this place is not The Cheesecake Factory with multiple menu pages.  There are very few menu items, half are raw or crudo options and there are very few vegetarian options.  

Got to sample a few dishes including the Butterfish, Tuna, Maya's Farm Salad, Mushrooms Au Gratin, Squid Ink Risotto and Flourless Chocolate Cake.  Everything was fantastic!  The chocolate cake was a little dense, but tasted better with the caramel ice cream.

I would give a few recommendations prior to dining here:  do not go starving.  It took 45 minutes from the time we sat down 'till we received our first course.  I would say it takes 1 hour per course, so plan accordingly.  Definitely don't go on a first date!  Ha.  

Kudos to the chef and our friendly waiter."}
{"text":"Crudo is amazing. Best place to eat in Phoenix. I did the 3 course meal. The ahi plate was small but incredible. I also tried the butterfish and yellowtail plate but you can't beat the ahi.

I had the gnochitti fig plate which was amazing as well as the short rib plate.

The apple desert was my favorite of the 3 offered. Crudo was lare and could accomadate large parties."}
{"text":"It's perfect except for the petite size of the food. My fiancée and I went with the three-dish coursing option but felt we could have more for what we paid. I wish I could give this place four stars and a half."}
{"text":"The bartenders take time and craft each cocktail to perfection. They cocktail menu is just as impressive as their food menu. Come to this place and take a food risk."}
{"text":"Very small portions, but stellar food. Great patio dining. Their grilled polenta and sweet corn ice cream is one of the best desserts I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"This was such a great dinner. First, a friend and I started at the bar. They have a great happy hour, $5 drinks and half off their cheese plates. I had a couple of their Gin Tom Collins. Yum. Never thought I was a gin girl until recently. We shared the mozzarella plate. It was sooooo good. It had carmelized onions, bacon bits, and a balsamic reduction drizzle. I'm salavating just thinking of it. 

Once we got into the main dining room, we sat at the oversized community table. Definitely a really cool, mellow vibe going on in there. They have a 3-course meal for $35. We went through the courses and picked out 3 each so we could taste a little of everything. Perfecto. A few of my favorites were the squid ink risotto and the butterfish? I can't remember which fish course I enjoyed more. But overall, everything was delicious and I'm sure I'll be back. 

They're tucked away so you can't really see them from the street. I hope it stays that way so it doesn't become over flooded with people, because I'm sure once they get the experience, they'll be coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"The pigs ears, smoked olives, mozzarella, all excellent. The service was the best.  I love the model where you basically pay $35.00 for three courses, $45 for 4 and $55 for 5 so creative.  I could only do 4 max however.  The cocktail menu was creative and fun.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Crudo is a fantastic place!  Everything I've eaten (or drank) there has been ridiculously good.  For me, the crudo (raw fish) course is the best - the albacore tuna with black garlic is my favorite, but the butterfish and yellowtail are also great.  The grilled course is my second favorite, and I'm still thinking about the pork belly with polenta.  The mozzarella with bacon and onion is a nice light option.  In the cooked course, the mushroom gratin is crazy rich and delicious.  I've had the squid ink risotto, too; although it tasted good, the rice had been over-cooked into a mushy soup with no bite.

You can choose a three, four, or five-course menu and save money or order a la carte.  You get a great value in choosing the courses option since the courses are pretty good size.  My first time here, my wife and I each ordered the four-course meal (we thought that the courses might be a bit small and we wanted to try a lot of things) and shared an appetizer and dessert, and we ended up taking home two entire dishes.  So, yeah, the courses are plenty big.

Finally, you can't go wrong with any of the cocktails or the crispy pig ears.  Can't wait to come back to Crudo."}
{"text":"Superb! The single most interesting meal that we've had in Arizona. Highly recommended.

Food  5 stars+
Service 5 stars+
Atmosphere 3 stars 

We had a really terrific meal here.  This is the only restaurant I've eaten at in this town that could compete with serious restaurants in NY or LA.  

We shared 8 dishes (two $45 four-course menus) and followed our server's recommendations exactly on everything.

Pig Ears - a salty crispy snack up front

Albacore with apples, truffle and black garlic
Yellowtail with controne and bottarga

Burrata with pancetta vinagraitte 
Grilled Mozarella 

Squid-ink Risotto
Mushrooms with mozarella and egg

Veal breast
Pork Belly with smoked tomatoes

We loved every single dish.  The stand-outs were the burrata, which was just sublime; the mushrooms with mozz and egg; and the pork belly, the perfect crescendo to the meal.  The courses build in a very logical progression that is a bit hard to explain.  Somehow the whole is greater than the sum of the parts here and it tastes far more impressive than it reads, with tremendous contrast between each of the dishes in each of the courses.  

Our server, Ashley, was friendly, gracious and very-well informed and we never waited more than a minute or two for anything.  All of the support staff were right there with her in terms of professionalism and warmth.  Absolutely top-notch service in every respect.

A few minor quibbles.

Why no bread?  Yes, the cheese course comes with a piece or two of bread but since every plate emphasizes such delicious sauces, it is really crying out for some delicious homemade bread to run through that extra sauce.  It's a bit puzzling that they don't offer that.

The wine list is alright and we enjoyed the $60 Daou Cabernet we had - but a few more moderately priced wine specials would be nice.

The outsourced dessert was fine but a restaurant of this caliber deserves a pastry chef. After such a stellar multi-course meal, you really want to be wowed by the dessert. The rather ordinary apple tart seems a bit out of place here.

The only thing I just didn't like was the restaurant space itself, which doesn't seem so much minimalist as it does unfinished.  Such luxurious food deserves a more luxurious atmosphere. When we walked in, my wife said \"Did they just open?\"  Because it looks like they just opened and haven't had a chance to finish the interior space.  Hang some stuff on the wall already!  Besides the blank walls, the space is just not that inviting and many of the tables in this cavernous space are directly in front of the kitchen and bathroom doors, which distracts from the food and the total experience.

The net effect of the atmosphere is kind of like watching a great actor perform in a garage. It's riveting but you'd love to experience it in a more suitable venue. In a town where the food scene is dominated by multi-million dollar chain restaurants serving comfort food, $16.00 \"gourmet\" burgers and frat-boy sushi, this place stands head and shoulders above the competition. I'd love to see the chef get the space he deserves.

The total bill for a splendid two hour dinner was $204 plus tip."}
{"text":"I have been to Crudo twice - once for restaurant week and another for drinks and appetizers.  The food was amazing!  We ordered the albacore, yellowtail, squid ink risotto, gnocchi and the salted orange and caramel budino with cream for dessert.  Everything was wonderful however the gnocchi was overcooked.  The cocktails were also quite good.  The ambiance is somewhat comparable to Searsucker minus the frills.  Quite surprising considering the location.  The waitress was also very helpful and opinionated with her favorite dishes and drinks.  

As far as the appetizers, I don't remember what we ordered as 2 drinks had already kicked in at the time.  However, they were both $10 dishes with toasted bread which was probably not worth the carbs at the time as it was fairly meh and flavorless."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. I was very excited to try this place as they a very interesting menu with fun items like pig ears.  Pig ears were very good as was the bone marrow and gnocchi.   Sadly, that was it.  Lamb belly, risotto, sea bass crudo were very sub par.    Lack of seasoning and average quality fish was obvious.   Too bad.   Creative menu but lack of care to quality and execution."}
{"text":"This was fantastic! Went for my birthday celebration with my boyfriend. The menu is a little confusing at first but basically each person can order 3, 4, or 5 courses (which is cheaper than ordering a la carte). We shared the ahi tuna, farmers market salad, buratta, raviolo, brisket, and risotto. 6/6 we're all amazing and we were very impressed. 

They greeted us with a prosecco toast for our celebration and we're very informative and kind!

The pricing was a little high in my opinion but at the same time you can't get that food anywhere else in the valley so cheers to them. Excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Great service, damn good food. We got the ahi, yellowtail, and butterfish. All fresh and cim o letely flavorful...props to the chef.

The gnocchi was hearty and the sauce was to die for. So rich and yummy.
Short rib was melt in your mouth goodness
Brisket was by far the best brisket I've ever had...and I've eaten a lot of brisket. If it was a drug, you'd find me OD'd facedown on the cold tile floor.

Come eat here...now."}
{"text":"Not bad, the atmosphere is jeopardized because if feels like you are in a retail shop more than a restaurant.  The chef's talent come out with the very well plated dishes.
This location is worth the time to stop by for a bite to eat,  I hope to see the restaurant gain its creditability and grown into something really nice.  The creativity of the food will one day out grow their current location."}
{"text":"We went back to Crudo for another visit, this time to try the food. Oh. My God. Run, don't walk, to have a meal there. Incredible. The boyfriend and I each did the 3 items for $35, and between tasting each others' plates, we were absolutely thrilled and stuffed. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Crudo. The brisket is the best! Chef Cullen is one of the best chefs in the valley. Crudo is the perfect place for a date night"}
{"text":"The ambiance was described as intimate, think urban chic. Service was excellent and the food was outstanding.  You can choose from a 3,4,or,5 course option with small portions. But those are generous, or having entree size. We opted for 3 courses & shared dessert.I had a mixed green salad that was scrumptious , my husband had the ahi and loved it. We both chose the grilled mozzarella, yummy. I had the fish special, a salmon dish. My only dis is that it was served medium rare. My husband had the pork belly and loved it. Dessert was a chocolate mousse cake, easily shareable because it is so rich.

If you live in the area and consider yourself a foodie check this place out."}
{"text":"Now this is how fine dining should be!  Crudo is all about the food and there is not a whiff of pretension anywhere.  

If your interested in a dining experience that is more about snooty patrons, pretentious waiters and a formal atmosphere than the actual food, Crudo may not be for you.  If however, you are interested in amazing food then you should definitely treat yourself to a meal at Crudo.

The atmosphere feels like an upscale Bistro rather than a traditional fine dining destination.  There are a few patio tables with a view of old town Scottsdale and a few indoor tables that have an amazing view of the kitchen.  Inside that kitchen is the genius chef who you can watch buzz around creating your fantastic food.  

And then the food... my god!  It is literally some of the best food I have ever tasted.  The menu is constantly changing but I doubt you could go wrong with any option and there are some general tips I can offer.  First, go with the multi-course option.  This will allow you to try many of the chefs creations.  Second start with one, or more, of his raw fish preparations.  I have had butterfish, yellowfin tuna and two different big-eye tuna dishes at Crudo and each one was a an italian delight to rival the best sushi.  The butterfish was the best fish I have ever tasted!  I could not heap enough praise onto that particular dish to do it proper justice.  Finally, be prepared to have a long meal.  The chef does all the cooking himself, with some prep help from a sous chef, so the courses take a while.  But believe me, with the right company the time will be enjoyable and the food is more than worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. My Fiance and I love coming on Sundays for brunch. The Streusel French Toast with mixed berry compote is the best. I wish they would send out more emails to their customers with coupons or encouraging them to come visit!"}
{"text":"I took a friend here as a thank you for several days of cat-sitting. The food was fantastic, but the service left a lot to be desired.

We each started with a Violet Femme cocktail. It was delicious, although a tad too sweet for me. To be fair, I do not like sweet cocktails at all.

I decided to go with 4 courses, and my friend went with 3. We each ordered different items, in order to maximize the number of dishes we got try. We ended up with:

-Burrata: creamy and everything burrata should be
-Ricotta: this dish was absolutely amazing, especially with the oney
Yellowtail: beautiful presentation, light and refreshing
-Vodka pasta:delicious, and while rich, not too heavy
-Semolina gnocchi: like a mini lasagna. would order again in a heartbeat 
-Tortellini pie:I did not know what I was getting into with this. I could have had this as a meal by itself. Tortellini and beef baked inside pie crust....excuse my while I clean up my drool
-Pork belly: this was the only dish I didn't care for. The sauce for the pork bell was too sweet, even for the saltiness of the pork belly.
-Ricksaw red wine- for my second drink I went with this. I've had the Ricksaw before and loved it, but this tasted like it had be open for awhile.

While the food was fantastic, the service was so slow. We spent 2.5 hours here. I get that it's more of a \"slow\" dining establishment, but there is a difference between allowing me time to enjoy my food and lackadaisical service. To me, this service experience was representative of the latter. We waited a long time between each dish.  The couple sitting next to us ended up cutting their meal short due to the inattentive service.

I might come back and sit at the bar, but they would need to improve their service before I'd want the full dining experience again."}
{"text":"If you're never been, you are so missing out. The best gnocchi (get the semolina - it's a locally grown wheat), hands down, that we have ever had. The crudo itself (raw fish- think Italian sashimi) has great, fresh selection with perfect pairings. Also try the burricotta- house made combo of burrata & ricotta (I think I could eat that every day).  For your first run, do a course menu. It's 3/4/5 choices- but of your choice, not pre picked."}
{"text":"You'd never know such a hidden gem exists tucked behind a dump of an old shopping center, but when you open the doors the foodie gods will sound their trumpets and the angels will sing!   This place is a FIND....not stuffy or pretentious, but the offerings are on par with the best I've had anywhere!

Fantastic, spare decor.
Friendly host staff.
AMAZING, vibrant, and creative craft cocktail list.
Fantastic, funky and often WAY out of your comfort zone menu selections.

Love their tasting menu that allows you to taste any three items on the menu for $45!  We added a shared appetizer (whipped goat cheese with charred beets...probably my favorite dish of the evening!)."}
{"text":"Wow what a nice night. We came in for the Wed night polenta board and it was wonderful. It consisted of rendezvous chicken with sausages and four different side toppings. Great food - great wine - great staff on top of the great deal. Only $40."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Back again.  Had some old standby's and some newer additions.

For the pigs' ears and risotto, see the former review.

Tried the chicken heart skewers.  Very good.  Not done like yakitori, which tend to be a little overcooked.  These were cooked to medium and had nice texture and a decent amount of salt.  Also got the Farmer crudo plate, which was arugula, tomato, cucumber with avocado vinaigrette.  (Sorry, no photo because we ate it all before I remembered to take one.)

Also ordered the gargati with mussels.  This was the weakest dish of the night.  The pasta was al dente but the texture was off.  There were a lot of mussels (which were large, meaty and nice) but the menu also listed uni, and we could not catch a whiff or taste the richness of it anywhere in the dish.  The tomato sauce was pretty good, though the dish was a little over-sauced as a whole.

Topped off dinner with another Tracy Dempsey victory.  Blueberry crostada with white chocolate streusel on top.  Served warm, it was not overly sweet with good texture between the crust, streusel, and the blueberry filling.  My wife, initially dubious, was converted.  We both loved it.

So all in all, another successful dinner.  The gargati was a minor misstep in an otherwise fine dinner."}
{"text":"After 10 years of living in Manhattan, NY, I have finally found a new restaurant in Scottsdale which serves high quality, haute italian cuisine.  Yes the portions are small, but its a tasting menu.  They are designed to take you on a wild flavor journey--which they certainly do.  Such a huge step up from the lack of substance this Valley has to offer!  If you think the food at places like the Vig and Postino are what high end eating is all about, this is probably not the place for you.  Splurge and take someone special on a date here.  And let the staff help you with wine pairings.  

Seating on the patio is great.  The inside is totally kitsch but could be saved with some decent ambiance lighting."}
{"text":"The food was certainly tasty, but a bit pricy.

$5 for about 8oz of grapefruit juice.
$3 for unlimited iced tea. Uniquely, the tea was green tea and had fruity undertones. 

$6 for the crudo jar. Good sized delicious two slices of bread came with it. The horseradish was a nice touch. Beets were large chunks. I cut them into smaller pieces.

$12 for scramble with spinach. The toast literally just had a chunky avocado smear on top. Flavors were lighter. The scramble consistency was cooked incredibly well, but the flavors weren't too special to me...

$16 pork belly. This was very nicely cooked. Juicy. And very very very flavorful. I added some of the gravy sauce to my scramble.. Hehe.

The portions were decent. This was all split between two people... And we are full. 

The wait staff were friendly. And the atmosphere was classy but chill. I would come back again for brunch. :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful Italian preparations, lovely staff, and terrific bar with one of the best mixologists in the city.  Chef Cullen is a master, and we are very fortunate to have him within walking distance to our home.  Maureen (front of house and Cullen's wife) is charming and sets the tone for a truly sophisticated, elegant experience."}
{"text":"The food and service was terrible! I don't understand the good reviews. We came here for my fiancés birthday because of the great reviews... we ordered a bunch of different plates for the four of us. The pig ears was good but the rest was not so good. The mixture of food made us all feel sick at the end. Too much of a mixture but you have to do it that way because the plates are TINY. Very very small portions. A lot of the plates just tasted awful. The bill came out to $320 for the four of us. Totally not worth it. The service was also terrible! Our waitress had a chip on her shoulder and NEVER came to our table and it wasn't even busy. I ordered a Cosmopolitan as my drink and they brought me something different and didn't tell me what it was. It was just a bad experience and definitely not coming back. Mostly because the food was pretty nasty."}
{"text":"I had the chance to check out Crudo during restaurant week a few weeks ago. Wow, was I impressed. The albacore tuna crudo was to die for with truffle oil and aged black garlic. The bit of sea salt added texture and dimension that I loved. I also had the squid ink risotto, amazing. I now see what all the fuss was about in the reviews. 

If you have a chance to check out Crudo do it! Sit at the bar and chat with the awesome guys who serve up unique cocktails or take a seat in the dining area. Very simple and modern decor, great service, amazing overall. I'd go back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Took my mom here w/ my family for a nice dinner out. Incredible, top quality service, nice atmosphere, and awesome food. Would go back here with a date sometime, it was a super classy restaurant."}
{"text":"Best of the best!  Cocktails are second to none and the food is for true food lovers. Sit at the bar, have the bartender create something for you, order the pig ears and enjoy."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time at this restaurant. We had a bad experience with service and food last year, but decided to give it another try. Instead, we were left with the SAME results. No one at the hostess stand to greet you. So we ended up sitting ourselves. We order drinks, those were great! Then order ONE food item, the strozzapreti. Literally took 25+mins. No one came back to check on us. Not even to tell us why pasta took long. When we finally was served the pasta, it had about 6-8 pasta noodles lol. I wish I could make this up. Had big pieces of chicken and a few pieces of pasta. We didn't have great service and then food was bad. Not recommend!"}
{"text":"Cocktail's are awesome. Squid ink risotto was really good. Off drinks alone Crudo is one of the best in phoenix."}
{"text":"Squid ink risotto is absolutely amazing!  Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Yes I can drive all the way from LA to Arizona just to eat here....Well not everyday, but when I visit Arizona again this will be on my must dine list.

Enjoyed several drinks, outdoor patio with heat lamps, and plenty of food.  We opted for the 5 items for $55.  Yes it is per person, but that ended up being 10 different dishes to enjoy.  Great to be able to pick several dishes and be able to sample the culinary items here.  I also enjoyed the fried pig ears and would put that on a must try list for first timers.

On a side note this place is located on the backside of the shopping area it is located in.  So if you cannot find it, go around back.  I did not notice the large banner strung across the front since it was dark.  Last time I was at Crudo it was in Scottsdale.  

I do not think you will find an item to not like, but I do recommend the short rib, squid ink risotto, and crispy pork ears.

Enjoy guys, I hope to be back in a few months to dine out at Crudo."}
{"text":"Sweet, Sour, Salty, Spicy, Smokey, Savory or wait was that Salty, Spicy, Savory, Sweet, Smokey, Sour? Crudo is a restaurant that is a carnival for your mouth. I'm not talking about clown carnival, I am talking about Carnival in Brazil kinda Carnival! Thankfully I had the perfect martini cleansing my sinning tongue as the show went on. Starting with the Antipasta Pig Ears (These strips of perfection play spice with sweet and sour), Ahi Crudo (Unreal, just unreal how good this was), Squid Ink Risotto (Savory with bits of pepper and tuna hiding in darkness), Beef Brisket (A smoked strip of beef that breaks away with the slightest tug of the fork) and to finish that parade of debauchery a strawberry balsamic creation placed perfectly in a shortbread crust.  Kudos to Crudo! So excited to come back and taste the rest of the parade of flavors."}
{"text":"I thought the Crispy Pig Ears were delicious, lightly salted with a good amount of spices and vinegar.

I thought my brisket was really fatty and too buttery. I would have liked some more starch food like some rice or potato or something that would fill me up more.

I thought the decor was very cute and refreshing. It seems like a good date restaurant."}
{"text":"The Why:  Helmed by Chef Cullen Campbell and highly praised by local palates I respect Crudo seems to have all the things I'd hope for in a local restaurant; high quality sourcing, a strong sense of community, and a unique but focused menu - in this case raw seafood, hand pulled mozzarella, and house-made pastas.

The Service:  ...to say my service at Crudo was perfunctory would be an understatement.  Beginning first with kitchen timing; a 25 minute delay between course 2 and 3 (from pick-up to delivery) with my waitress stopping by twice to say it would 'be right out' is poor form.  Additionally, while speaking of my waitress, considering the fact that I was obviously interested in the food it would have been nice if she acted more interested in me as a diner - instead she did not inquire even once as to how I enjoyed a dish and asking questions felt more like attempting to drag forth information while she instead spent time describing the menu at length to a needy woman who wanted all her dressing on the side and modifications to myriad dishes.  Perhaps I'm a bit presumptuous here, but if someone is there (with, or without a camera) dining solo they are clearly there because they are passionate about the food and if a server chooses to ignore that it is evidence that he or she cannot read a diner and thus should not be in that position - particularly when the other servers were engaging their tables between each course and even brought the Chef out to say hello.

Crispy Pig Ears - chili vinaigrette:  Setting the tempo early, this dish is all about flavor and while the texture is largely that of the crackling pork ears and chewy cartilage within the flavor is a bit sweet, a bit sour, a lot of heat and a lot of porky sapor.  Can't say I 'get' the price discrepancy (or why it is so difficult for restaurants in general to update their online menu) but this is a good choice at $5 or $7.

Butterfish - tomato, lardo, arugula:  Call me crazy, but I don't really get the fuss over this dish; sure the smooth texture and mild flavor of the fish are conducive to the overall flavor arc, but with the lardo shaved particularly thin and the oven-dried tomatoes quite intense there simply was not much here that could not have been achieved with a bit of salt and fresh sliced tomato; the flavor something akin to a bland BLT and the arugula not particularly notable at all.

Grilled Mozzarella - tomato, grilled date, basil:  For my money the best savory course of the night - a strong compliment considering the fact that a lot of the food was quite good - this was simple and intense, each ingredient packing serious flavor and all brought into harmony by the smoky warm mozzarella.  Served with olive oil brushed grilled bread I'll note here that if you desire more than a single skimpy slice (with this, or with any other course) you should ask well in advance, and if you have my server ask twice as it is likely to be forgot.

Mushroom - mozzarella, truffle, egg:  I love eggs, but the overcooked white and half-set yolk in this dish really added nothing to the earthy amalgam of mushrooms and mozzarella.  Texturally accented by toasted brioche and meeting with a hefty drizzle of truffle oil (I do not believe any actual truffle was harmed in the making of this dish) this was without a doubt the most texturally interesting savory of the evening and although I only received another slice of bread after the remaining juices had turned cool I still wiped this one clean before sending it back to the kitchen.

Risotto - Squid Ink, Chili, Tuna, Tomato:  Apparently a bit of a signature dish at Crudo (and the only one my server would offer an opinion on aside from 'everything is really good') I must say that although I've had better risotto in terms of texture, the balance of flavors here was really something else - a subtle sweetness from the tomatoes melding beautifully with light heat from the chilis and the confit tuna' bold flavor standing up admirably in the face of the slightly gummy rice.

Porkbelly - smoked tomato agrodolce:  Fatty and funky with crackly skin resting atop toothsome and creamy polenta this was pork belly as it should be and showing a deft hand with tomatoes for the fourth of my five prix-fixe courses the smoked reduction here cut the fat perfectly - simply a great dish and a surprisingly large portion.

Apple Frangipane Tarte:  Outsourcing their desserts to Tracy Dempsey Originals I knew the quality here would be high and with a boring sounding panna cotta vs. a potted Tiramisu that looked quite good as my other options the tarte was a clear winner - the crust a dense shortbread and the filling a rich but light almond paste with caramel roasted apples topped off with a bit of whipped cream.  While I personally think any self-respecting restaurant of this caliber should be making their desserts in house it would be hard to quibble with choosing Ms. Dempsey who is now 4 for 4 in my book.

Good - but I'm not rushing back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food was the best. I've been to Dominiks in Scottsdale. So expensive, good but not.  Pig ears, amazing.  Yellow tail, delicate so fabulous.    Buratta with the bread, omg. The bar was perfect. My dirty martini was perfect. 
A must go."}
{"text":"Slices of sashimi-grade albacore tuna with green apple, black garlic and truffle oil on a white plate. Simple. Elegant. Fresh. Anything but complicated, this opening dish did not have the appearance of something that might kick me in the tastenards (my Yelpy apologies for such a lame expression). Damn, I was SORE after the first bite, and that initial offering really woke me up. It's a rare experience, unfortunately, knowing you're about to be wowed; so often high expectations have such sleepy returns. Not at Crudo. Everything, and I mean each and every bite and sip, was divine.

This is one of those spaces where you're already sort of groping the furniture before the food even shows up. It's twinkly, dark and sparse but surprisingly, um... cuddly? The kind of place where a marriage proposal suddenly, unexpectedly and unintentionally falls from a man's lips. The cocktails and the food and the service, it's all so good that you accidentally asked her to marry you on the first date. And she was just drunk enough to say Yes.

So what else. Christ, the Burrata. Rat-a-tat-tat, mwah. Excuse my Albuquerque ass for stating this, but the brisket, it wasn't brisket. Brisket's supposed to be smokey and tough, fit for a cowboy. This stuff was delicate and nuanced and bright, nestled with this stuff they called po-len-ta, not the kinda thing you'll find on the range. I kinda felt Brokeback, the way I surrendered to it.

Finally, a dash on the drinks. Um... I don't really recall much about them. The first, I remember the celery flavor, again walloped in the tastenards. Second one was a cognac thing, I could actually watch the hair growing on my chest, WOW. And that third one... nope, can't recall it. Not because I wasn't impressed, no... I was just too involved with chair and table groping to note any specifics. Add this place to a very teensy group of restaurants on my long-distance relationship list."}
{"text":"Quick review for a quick lunch 

I dined arrived around 11:30am on a Wednesday and the place was close to empty. No table service, but that was fine. 

I ordered the ham panini which was quite good; albeit just a bit small. Also, would have preferred a side other than potato chips. Price of the sandwich was $8 which seemed fair but would have hoped for a better side to be included. 

Vibe was different but good (shares space with retail shop and a salon patrons from next door wandered in). I will return to try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"We recently ate at Crudo and the food was excellent. We all ordered the tasting menu which gives flexibility to try many things. The drinks were also excellent, we tried the 'shot in the arm' and 'ramble on'. Must have from the tasting menu are the 'ahi' and the 'semolina gnocchi'."}
{"text":"The air conditioning at Crudo was not working well the night of my visit. I would have appreciated the opportunity to be forewarned before being seated, but then they probably would have lost my business.  There was an exceptionally long wait to be greeted by our server after being seated. Service was prompt after that. Chef's special tasting was a great value, dishes were unusual but not wildly adventurous like at Posh.  Fish tartare was interesting with watermelon and mint.  Risotto with chicken and mushrooms was a step up from Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup, but not a huge thrill.  Bread pudding was pretty nifty with crispy edges and a touch of sea salt.  Although I thought the meal was fine, I am really not highly motivated to return."}
{"text":"The location is a bit hidden (in the back of strip mall) but very well decorated inside. The course option is the way to go (any 3 dishes for $35 - awesome deal). The dishes use fresh ingredients and were delicious but some are on the sweet side and can be a bit bland. I had pig ears, risotto, gnocchi and brisket. The pig ears were amazing (fried, crispy pig ears with tangy syrup sauce) and we ended up ordering two later for the table. The rest of my dishes were tasty but not as impressive. The pork belly ordered by my friend got a lot of compliments though so I'd recommend that as well."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic!  Absolutely fantastic.  If the weather's nice, grab a seat in the small outdoor/patio section.

The course option was recommended.  We chose the 4 course deal which turned out to be a  LOT of food and I've got a big appetite.  Go with the three if you aren't that hungry.  

The food is good...not great but very good.  You can be very adventurous here if you like.  The crispy pigs ears is a favorite.  I didn't try.  I did get the squid ink risotto which wasn't my favorite.

The cheese selections are fantastic.  Also, very tasty fresh drinks.  They nailed a few of drinks...very creative.  The server will point you in the right direction."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed if you are looking for creative drinks and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the most bizarre dining experiences of my life. This place is awkwardly attached to a combination beauty salon and weird shop selling random clothes, jewelry, greeting cards and the like. There was literally no ambiance as the tables inside (as opposed to their patio) are literally in the middle of the store while you are being assaulted by the smell of hairspray and other chemicals from the salon. 

In addition to the setting, the service was terrible and they were out of about a quarter of the items on their menu and wine list. 

The cherry on top was that they serve tiny portioned raw sashimi, yet it takes about 30 minutes for each dish to come out. So you eat four little bites of fish and then wait for 30-45 minutes for your next four little bites of fish. It was almost comical by the end of our meal, which took two hours - and not in a good way where you are enjoying yourself so much you don't realize you've spent two hours at the table. 

All in all it was a bizarre and brutal dining experience. I would never go back."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's favorite spot. Best cocktails in Arizona and the staff is awesome. I highly recommend sitting in the bar area for the best experience. You MUST order the pig ears, smoked olives and the butterfish. We come once a month!"}
{"text":"Very cool, hip and almost \"secret\" feel as it is located behind the building. The food is a somewhat pretentious (although I like that) and the menu is not that large. I've joined for dinner a couple times but I'm dying to try their brunch as the menu looked wonderful! I would say crudo is fit for a foodie. Its right down the block from me so Id definitely be back but if it wasn't so close I don't know that I would."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed in this place especially after reading all of the good reviews on yelp about it. After calling we drove almost an hour to get there excited to try their infamous crispy pig ears only to walk in the door and have the hostess tell us their closed until July 14th. 
Here's an idea... 
Put up a sign or don't answer the phone but instead leave a recording on your voicemail stating your closed. It would also be nice if when someone calls to ask if they need a reservation you didn't tell them you take walk ins but instead say \"we're closed currently\" if your not even open for business. Also know that this place is a bit hard to find if you don't notice the paper sign that's said's Crudo's is in back.
This experience sure left a bad taste in my mouth."}

{"text":"Tonight, I ate here for the fourth time in six weeks. I obviously liked my first three visits or I wouldn't have returned. The food and service were very good the first three times. However, this evening was a somewhat different experience. I once again ordered the three course meal and a bottle of wine. The first two course were good, but my main course was so salty it was inedible. When the waiter asked me how it was I had to say that I really could not eat it so I sent it back on his recommendation (something I do perhaps once per ten years and I eat in over 50 restaurants per year). He came back and said that they could re-prepare the dish or make another dish, but I needed to let them know ASAP as they were shutting down the kitchen. This was at 9:15 PM and they close at 10:00 PM (and I was the ONLY customer in the entire dining room). I assumed they didn't really want to make another plate of food and since the sauce was the saltiest part, I doubted that they could correct the problem before they shut their kitchen down early. As such, I advised them to skip the third course and adjust my bill accordingly. My entrée was listed as $20.00 on the menu, but the only reduced the bill by $10.00. I asked the waiter to please reduce it a more resonable amount or have them \"refire\" the kitchen and cook me a proper entrée. At that point the chef's wife (who earlier sat me and greated me as return customer) angrily stormed out of the kitchen and said (approximately) \"I know you've been here before, but you ordered a multi-course meal and the cost of the first two courses reduces the cost of the entrée to $10.00. I took $20.00 off, but don't come back here again\". I nicely asked her if she tasted the dish and she said \"No, but the chef said that the sauce was over-reduced\" (meaning that they could not correct the problem without dumping water into the sauce). I simply said \"Look, you obviously don't like me, so I will not come back\" (I live in Pennsylvania and I am only here on business). She said \"Please don't\". When the waiter came to collect my credit card I asked him if she was one of the owners and he said \"yes\". I said I think she might be nuts. He seemed to agree. Good luck staying in business with that attitude."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, very bad service.  Happy hour took 20 minutes to get drink, they were out of their trademark appetizer - pigs ears, and had no menus for us when we arrived.  Food was so so.  I wasted my time."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Phoenix.  The cocktails are especially great and unparalleled in Phoenix.  Their cocktail program is world class. The food is unique and delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food, excellent prices and excellent ambiance!

We meant to join for dinner but we got to the restaurant in time for happy hour. After looking at the menu variety for HH we could not pass on the opportunity. We will definitely be back for dinner and more HH. The service was great, we were treated very well and the staff was always on top of it ready to help us as we needed then. 
The menu choices were great too, such a great variety to choose from, drinks and food. The bar area was pretty too and we loved the decor, location, lighting and so on. We definitely will make this a regular place for us."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Brought a group of women for a Sunday brunch. My party was late and very demanding of allergen sensitivities. The staff was patient, helpful and pleasantly helped my girlfriends have an experience they were all glowing about afterward. 

Not to mention. The food was outstanding."}
{"text":"It is not often you find a place that you can indulge your taste buds with perfect combinations.

Crudo is a simple in its presentation and crudo by definition is defined  raw fish dish dressed with olive oil, sea salt, and citrus juice.  The Chefs here combine the perfect amount of salt and ingredients to enhance the natural flavors of the fish.

I have now dined there three times and each time enjoy it more and more.  The location is different which makes it that much more enchanting.  You ask yourself 5 star food in a boutique/ spa?  There are about 5 tables inside and a small bar, the outside patio preferably weather permitting.

Menu:  Basically two parts cold and hot - crudo always has a market fish available, along with about 5 other options.  What makes the crudo existing is that the flavors used to dress the Crudo are always changing.

The Hot plates again about 5, you can generally expect a beet stained risotto or squid ink and tuna risotto both so good I can't decide which is better.  Also, on the menu when I have been there is the veal - always perfect and tender falling onto my fork.

The flavors and talent of the chefs here are to be challenged by few in the valley.  

Service:  You can't get more personal, the chefs are right there, talking, cooking and tasting.  One server generally taking care of the wine bottles turned glasses full of water.  They remember you, your tastes and are pleasant and love the food their serving.

Wine List:  Wine list is small but solid, they seem to regularly have wine tasting, and I have attended two both in which the wines were spot on.  Not over the top expensive but nice well made wines.

I cannot recommend enough, I think that you are missing a culinary experience if you don't attempt Crudo.  Your tongue won't regret it."}
{"text":"Hidden away on the south east corner of camelback and 36th street you will find this gem!
It's cozy and could feel the comforting warmth the moment you step in. We started with martinis at the bar and had crispy pig wars and their yellow tail as appetizers. Every bite was decadent and flavorful.
Then we walked into the dining area for our main course. We shared the escargot and squid ink risotto! I'm so in love with their signature dish- squid ink risotto. 
I'll definitely have to come back and try their other dishes therefore I'll be coming back sooner than expected.
Thank you crudo for such a fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"Very flavorable  food. We went with another couple and we basically got 4 starters, 4 dinners & 3 deserts and shared it all. I feel like I got a good sample of a lot of items on the menu at once. Yes it was a lot of food but excellent."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Craft cocktails were great. The service was the absolute worst. Got served one cocktail in an hour and had to get the check from the bartender. I'll never go back"}
{"text":"Wow this place is something special. I was so looking forward to going back after a great experience last summer albeit a bit hesitant to go during restaurant week. Had very high expectations to fill last night and Crudo did not disappoint. I started with the Arcadia Club to drink, loved the egg white foam to top it off. My mom and I shared the pig ears to start; a little too on the vinegar-y side for my taste but can you beat anything that's been fried? For my three courses I went with the Albacore Crudo, Brisket and an olive oil cake for dessert. Oh and had to add the Burrata! The truffle oil and the black garlic on the crudo were divine! So so satisfying. The brisket was the perfect blend of crispy and just the slightest bit of fat for flavor and moisture. Quality is just top notch, everything was so delicious and the perfect portions to get a taste of everything. Only minor complaint would be the pace of the courses, everything came out so quickly as if it had been sitting there ready and waiting for some time. The staff is very attentive; always refilling water and bringing fresh silverware for each course. Thank you for another amazing meal! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"A little challenging to find but so, so worth it! I was itching to get out and went on the recommendation of a foodie friend. I'm so glad I did! This is a truly wonderful place to go with friends, family or on a date. You should definitely go! *Everyone* should go!

Tucked around the back of the Gaslight Shopping center (really tucked around the far back) is a nondescript entrance.* Upon opening the doors you are greeted with the main dining area, to the right. There is ample seating for groups which looked super comfy. My friend and I ambled over to the bar area on the left side. 

The bar ambience is super chill. The mood lighting had been turned down and we headed towards the back, where there are low side chairs. I was immediately struck by the menu written on the wall in chalk. Drinks! 

We scored big time and managed to grab one set of drinks before happy hour ended. (T-Sa, 5-7pm). A bartender quickly greeted us (even though much of the bar was full) and took an order. I figured we'd have to hustle up to the bar, but no! Very nice! 

Happy Hour:
$5 small bites. $5 cocktails. $5 Red wine. $5 White wine. 
$3 Four Peaks Sunbru & Hopknot. 

I was a BIG fan of the red. Big!

I was overwhelmed by the amount of food options on the menu. There was quite a bit of stuff to look at and we had been gabbing. So I asked the very nice bartender to sum it up for us. 

A \"Crudo\" / Raw option (yellowtail) provided the delightfully light sashimi thing I'd been yammering I'd wanted in forever. (Sushi used to be a weekly staple back in NYC for me.) As described by the bartender the yellowtail delivered with a nice bit of spice. Yum! (It's worth noting the price of a crudo plate offers much more than what you'd get at a sushi restaurant.)

We followed that with a heartier option from the \"Cotto\" / Cooked side. The texture of the butternut squash dumplings was a complete surprise to me. For some reason I was expecting an asian style dumpling to come out. Instead the outside layer was a rich, soft layer, almost like mashed potatoes. Different but in a very delish way.

This is a definite must to check out! Just be sure to give yourself enough time. You won't want to leave.

* It's quicker to enter from 36th street vs. the E Indian School street entrance. There isn't a sign but it's the first business when you pull into behind the buildings.

UPDATE: The service is a little spotty. I'm not changing the stars. I'm just updating to reflect that it's unfortunate when your drink order gets forgotten. Tonight I had the pleasure of sitting in the alcove tables (in the bar area). These are wonderful if you want to have a quiet spot to talk. 

There's a point in the evening when a cocktail server takes over the outside tables in the bar area. (This happened last time.) However, as I was on a date I noticed the gap in service a bit more. Also, my date was the one to point out that our drinks had not been placed. When the bartender came out to check on us, I explained our drink order had been placed. (We then watched our server come out awhiiiilllle later to ask the same bartender where our drinks were. OOps.)

Also, it's incredibly (to the point of distracting) loud when the bartenders make drinks. I'm the first to appreciate a good show. (Thank you Tom Cruise.) But simmer down up front. Yes, I'm getting old. But it's hard to hear!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the bartender that I had here that I had to yelp about it... These bartenders are craftsmen! Delicious drinks and a very cool atmosphere. It's a very hip and relaxing spot to get a way and have a drink."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in Tempe for spring training and decided to take a break from sweating, baseball and obnoxious baseball fans by coming to dinner at Crudo.

This reminds me to add a Yelp tip but it's a little tough to find, being located on the backside of a decidedly dowdy strip mall.  To be exact, it's right behind an antique superstore of sorts.

Parking is a little squished especially when they have a mobile pizza oven trailer parked right behind where you're trying to back out.

Hubby and I both enjoyed our experience here.  In a nutshell, we liked:

- High ceilings and tables set well apart from each other is a refreshing change from all those other restaurants trying to make the best use of their real estate for maximum income.
- Service was spot on.  Friendly (but not chatty) and water glasses are always filled. It was the right amount of checking in and our server also got the bartender/owner to make a drink that they weren't planning on serving anymore.
- Food overall was good.  Lighter dishes I feel were done better than the heavier dishes.

Highly recommend any of the raw fish crudo's.  Hubby's yellowtail and my albacore were both impeccably prepared and we hoovered these first couple courses.  

Crispy pig ears - to die for.  Really, even if you don't typically eat pig ears like a lot of Asian people do, I think you'll love this dish.  It's reminiscent of Animal's version, minus the sunny side up egg.

Cheese courses were also good.  The burricotta was a little bland in some spots because the sprinkling of the sea salt on top wasn't very uniform.  The burrata, however, was fantastic through and through.

Other dishes we ordered:  Squid Ink risotto...probably our least favorite dish of the evening...was inexplicably tangy/sour???  I switched with hubby who got it because he didn't like the sourness.  He took my gnocchi dish which was served in a red sauce with rapini and shredded pork.  Also very tasty!

The final dishes we ordered - fish of the day and pork belly with polenta were basically the heaviest and probably least remarkable.  TO BE FAIR, we were stuffed by this point.  Hubby did end up eating all of his fish, giving me about 1/3 of it while refusing any part of my pork belly.  The fish was well prepared but lacked anything that helped it stand out.  The pork belly was tender and unctuous while the polenta was creamy and good.  

Cocktails were fantastic.  I ordered the Dazed and Confused first which was delicious and barely tasted of any alcohol so I sucked that baby down in record time.  I wanted the snozberry soda which I was told was no longer being made because not many people ordered it.  Our server got it made and when I tasted it, I knew why it didn't sell well but it was also the reason why I loved it - it was bitter and herby.  Wonderful!
Definitely don't recommend the tap water in Phoenix.  Hubby, a lifelong tap water drinker, requested bottled water for the first time ever.

Our visit to Crudo was fabulous and it's definitely some place we'd consider again the next time we come back!!"}
{"text":"A personal local favorite! A little pricy but well worth it. It's a great place to meet up with a good friend. Cool vibe. Ultra professional and friendly staff. Don't shy away from a $10 drink. They are worth every penny. Made with fresh herbs & fresh fruit/juice. The Rebel's Son (bourbon & rosemary) is delish! You gotta try the homemade ricotta and the fried pig ears (the vinaigrette they're served with is oh so yummy!)"}

I can't stop taking it all in.  they have such an interesting menu with things like pig ears and pigs head, and bone marrow.  very interesting cocktail menu with real mixologist.  this is such a wonderful place to go.   they have a happy hour Tuesday through Saturday 5 to 7 which is wonderful someone even showed my wife to the restroom instead of just pointing...how often does that ever happen?!? great job guys!!!b I would give a 5 if there were healthier menu options"}
{"text":"I was really really looking forward to coming to this restaurant, and, I have to say, it just didn't live up to my expectations. Yes, there were some standout dishes including the pig ears (which I never would have tried, but the husband (who usually is fairly conservative in his food eating) wanted to try it, so who was I to say no?) and the espresso budino....that was ohhh sooo tasty, loved it! The rest of the meal was a mixed bag (and we each had a 3 course meal plus an app and dessert). We had the grilled mozz (good, smokey, but nothing too special), butterfish crudo (good, especially for me - a non fishy fish eater- but I wouldn't get it again...it was super acidic), gnocchi (the gnocchi was good, but they meat they used was odd and neither of us really loved it), dumpling (the dumpling was kind of bland, like a large piece of soggy bread, but the meat in it was really good, just wished there was a little more of it), the brisket (this was really good, really liked the polenta, but it wasn't so good that I would go back for it), and the market fish (it was described as a light, white, mild fish....it was super fishy. So much so that we couldn't eat it. I don't think this was the restaurant's fault, but I think the waitress should have described it differently. To be fair, the owner or manager did come by and ended up taking it off of our 3 course meal and adding the dessert instead, so that was much appreciated). Overall, it was ok, but it isn't a place I could see myself going back to for dinner due to the high price and not amazing food, but I could see myself going back to the bar, getting pig ears, a beer, and a delicious espresso budino.....oh ya."}
{"text":"I've experienced both dinner and brunch, dinner was disappointing, I got the pork belly which wasn't crispy and tasted extremely weird (there was an barn animal smell to it which based on experience from eating good meats means it wasn't prepared right) gross. So dinner was a fail but the only reason this place is getting 4 stars is because of their brunch. Everything was amazing! I got the potato croquettes, bacon risotto and the truffle starter jar. All unbelievably yummy especially the potato croquettes! I'll definitely be going back for brunch never again for dinner"}
{"text":"Awesome environment! Great patio with fireplace burning pecan wood that just sets the mood perfectly! Delicious foods and great service!! Mam of many words keeps it brief."}
{"text":"I am writing this review, having known about Crudo for a while.  I read many of the reviews, as did my wife, and we thought this would perhaps be a place worth trying out one night for a date.   I am writing this after going to Crudo on a date with my wife on 04/06/2018.  We live in Mesa AZ.  Here are my observations and thoughts:

1) The appetizer of the seabass \"ceviche\" was good.  My wife and and l liked it.  

2) The market fish entree that I ordered was good.  My wife even liked the albacore (tuna) steak.  

3) My wife's gnocchi with lamb (I believe) was a bit salty for her.  She told me that it was actually way too salty for her.  Whether there was a lot of salt in it, or not, it tasted way too salty for her.  

4) Afterwards, for dessert, we decided to order the tiramisu of the day.  It was supposedly lemon curd flavor.  All my wife and I tasted was sugar.  It was way too sugary.  It also tasted more like cheesecake rather then tiramisu.  It was not tiramisu!!!

I am writing this having traveled to Italy many times with my wife.  We have traveled from as far North as the Switzerland border, to as far South as Sorrento/Napoli, and Amalfi.  My wife and I know what is tiramisu and Italian food.  This was not.  Lay off on the sugar!!  Stop trying to \"invent\" flavors for tiramisu, and stick to the traditional espesso/chocolate flavor.  If you do serve a lemon curd \"tiramisu\" call it cheesecake, not tiramisu!!  It was totally misleading.  Nothing like what is in Italy.  

Given my rating, I did not see the drive into Phoenix from Mesa on the Loop 202 Red Mountain Expressway as worth my time for this restaurant.  They have some good things, but there are many things that are so-so.  Either the food tasted way too salty, or was way to sweet.  

If indeed Crudo seeks to draw their inspiration from Italy, perhaps it is time that people who own this restaurant learn from the masters (in Italy!).  What they have here is a poorly done copy of Italian / American food.  They missed a lot of the subtle flavors that food in the Veneto, or even in Roma or Sorrento, embodies.  They Americanized it too much (in a bad way!).  I am all for being creative (as that is what we do as Americans), but creative is NOT adding more salt or sugar to the food.  Being creative is trying new combinations that compliment each other (not overpower the other, and definitely not adding more salt or sugar!)."}
{"text":"After circling the block a few times, we finally found this little jewel. As other reviews mentioned, Crudo shares its space with a salon and retail store. It was slightly odd, at first, sitting by clothes and I kept getting distracted by the cute jewelry displays. Eventually, we moved our table closest to the bar which was more comfortable. With bottles of wine half off on Fridays, we split a nice bottle of Nebbioso. After the half off, it was $18. The menu is very limited but I wanted to try so many things on it! Decisions, decisions. I went with the 4 course  menu ($40) because I wanted to try a little of alot. I chose the Market Crudo (squash blossoms, tempura fried stuffed with mackerel), Risotto (Beet stained with lightly fried beet chips and mixed with lardo), Butterfish (with tomato, lardo, and a citrus sauce), and Gniocchi. I wasn't a fan of the gniocchi as it had a sauce that reminded me of pot roast. I do not like pot roast. But the other courses I had were delicious. My hands down favorite was the creamy risotto. My only disappointment was that I couldn't eat more of it since it came third and I was getting stuffed. We split the Cheese plate which had so many things on it including some bread and meats. That was also a favorite. The service was excellent and the server was very knowledgeable and attentive. Since I plan to go back, I think I may stick with the cheese plate and risotto (and refuse to share with the husband). It was sooo good. I think the most I would do is the 3 course - $30 (as opposed the 4 course I chose) but that is because I can't hack eating more. I wish I could because this is place is way worth that....maybe I should invest in a cute pair of stretchy pants for my next visit."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. You cannot order a bad meal. The menu concept is very clever. The servers can explain the menu better than anywhere I have eaten in town. Great place to take a date."}
{"text":"Crudo was a huge surprise.  It's located on the back side of a strip mall.  Driving u it didn't look all that appealing, but as soon as I opened the door my apprehensions began to dissipate.

The hostess and waitress were super.  The Sazerac was great.  A tip of the hat to the bartender.

The menu was reassuring small.  A few things done well.  Crudo has selections of salads/appetizers, bruschettas, pastas, and entrees.  I went with an appetizer of smoked ollives, a bruschetta with burratta, and a fish.  

It was terrific."}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING!! We went to Crudo for their olive oil dinner. It was a four course dinner paired with olive oils from Italy as well as wines. The food along with the olive oil and wine pairings was absolutely delicious!! The flavors were amazing and harmonious! The whole meal was like a symphony!! My husband and I are eager to return!!!
**come early to enjoy one of their signature cocktails in the fun and cozy bar before you eat dinner. The cocktails are excellent!! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Visited Crudo again with good foodie friends and were just as delighted as the first time. We had dishes from every area of the menu, including two spectacular desserts, a Key Lime pie and a boudino. Just marvelous.
Portion sizes are perfect to allow lots of tasting without getting full.
The two cheese dishes we had, a burrata in fabulous olive oil and a Grilled Mozzarella were sublime.

One sour note - the house water is literally putrid. Undrinkable with a chemically metallic taste. Obviously drawn straight from the city water supply without any filtration . I would hope they could go to Home Depot a few blocks away and purchase a simple RO filter"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow!  The food here is fantastic!  My two friends and I each did the 4 courses for $45, which turned out to be a great way to try a lot of food!  We started out with the Crispy Pig Ears.  We didn't know if we were going to be gnawing on pig ears like my dog gnaws on his, but wow, they were not what we expected!  The flavor of the pig ears coupled with the crispy texture was amazing.  I also ordered the Square Garden from their bar menu, which was really light and refreshing, with a little kick.  Not what I would have expected given that it contains celery juice, but it was really good!

Now, on to the regular menu.  From the Raw menu we had the Yellowtail, Ahi Tuna and Albacore -- these were the stars of the evening, by far!  They are served sashimi-style, but each has its own treatment and light seasoning.  Very simple and clean, and very delicious!  From the Cheese menu we had the Burrata and Fresh Mozzarella.  I loved the bacon relish and caramelized onion together with the mozzarella!  Although my friend liked the Burrata (I liked it too when I tasted it), she said it was a little too rich to eat it all.  From the Cooked menu, we had the Risotto and the Salmon in Fata.  The Risotto is a signature dish for Crudo, and had great flavor!  It was really good!  Likewise, the Salmon was delish.  It's cooked inside of a plastic bag and they bring it to the table in the plastic bag and cut the top off.  It is very light, fluffy and has great flavor.  From the Grilled menu we had the Short Rib, Brisket and Pork Belly.  The Short Rib (sans the bone marrow) was very tender -- no knife needed!  The Brisket and Pork Belly were also really good, but the Short Rib was the star in that group to me.  

The food here is phenomenal and the service is very attentive.  I definitely want to come back to enjoy more!"}
{"text":"Pros:
 - Unique blend of different types of food
 - Good variety of flavors

Cons:
 - Portion size may be smaller than expected resulting in higher total price to be satiated

Favorite Dishes:
 - Butterfish crudo
 - Bone marrow

Only tried this place once but it was very good experience. The butterfish crudo was spectacular. Crispy pig ears was also good. Bone marrow is rather hard do find in general and they made it quite well."}
{"text":"My fiancé had been wanting to bring me here for quite some time. We finally had a weekend with zero plans and were able to have a cozy date night. I always look forward to an eclectic hand crafted cocktail menu and Crudo has nailed theirs. I ordered the Temporary Treuse. It was hot outside and the promise of lemon and pear sounded cool and refreshing. The drink was tantalizing and the garnish was a nice touch. Pear honey and lemon pair so nicely...who would have thought? ;)

Anyway - the concept at this place is like a cousin to the tapas theme. The plates are smaller and great for sharing w/ another person.  I really liked this concept and besides, sharing plates with my better half while on a date night made the experience even more fun. The menu is split up into 5 categories: Raw, Cheese, Antipasti, Cooked, and Grilled. We decided to do one of each (except no cheese). We did 1 Raw 1 Antipasti 1 Cooked and 1 Grilled. 

The pig ears from the antipasti menu were delightful. These fun little cracklings have the saltiness and texture of a pork rind glazed with a sweet Thai chili sauce. This small starter made for an exciting appetizer bite before our other dishes came out. They went quickly so it was a good thing the next couple plates came out fast!

From the Raw menu we ordered the albacore with citrus tonnato and dill. This was by far the best albacore I've ever had. All we could do was talk about how FRESH it tasted. The citrus was so light it was the perfect pairing w/ the albacore and didn't over power it at all. The dill was a tiny garnish which gave it a little kick at the end of each bite. From the cooked menu we got the Squid Ink Risotto. This dish was fun. The flavor was great but risotto is never high maintenance when it comes to flavor - just when it comes to cooking it and this dish was cooked perfectly. And no - the squid ink did not turn our teeth black hahaha. Lastly from the grilled menu we ordered the Squid dish. This was served with some sweet nardello peppers and cannellini beans in a nice salsa. The grilled squid was a nice texture to pair w/ the risotto and helped to feel like you were having an actual full on meal instead of small plates. The squid was cooked to perfection and did not have that overcooked rubber texture - each bite was clean and crisp. The beans in the dish provided plenty of protein and helped to \"fill you up\". 

Everything on the menu was so tempting but after these 4 dishes we had zero room! The bar staff was friendly. Busy but still made time to chat w/ us. Typically we sit at the bar because we enjoy pursuing the liquor choices. The prices are incredibly reasonable. You get a big city menu that boasts big flavor, you get big city drinks that are exquisitely crafted, and all at the cost of a boutique local spot. The bar area was def more quiet than the restaurant area which we enjoyed. The wall behind us was a giant chalkboard that had the entire cocktail menu all chalked out with small graphics of what each drink looked like when its poured. Thought that was a nice artistic touch to get the guests more involved when selecting their drinks. The lighting was soft and the foyer was inviting with its large armchairs and small library.  

All in all we'll be back again to try something new from each menu! We were very pleased."}
{"text":"We spent a wonderful evening at Crudo on Friday night for their \"soft\" opening.  Celebrated a birthday dinner with friends and were seated outside at a roomy table for 8 on the patio.  It was a bit cool outside but Dina, our waitress provided a cozy heating lamp that warmed us right up.  We started our evening with a bottle of red wine: Dina's recommendation of a Cabernet-Sangiovese blend that was perfect - smooth and tasty - and perfectly paired with our food choices.  We shared plates of rich butterfish, seasoned with basil and orange, a tuna/sashimi dish laced  with truffle sauce and an incredibly delicious dish, \"San Danielle Prosciutto,\" that is surrounded by homemade pickles and red peppers.  For dinner, we tried a sampling of the Yellowtail Stew, Risotto, Rolled Veal, Gnocchi, and Fingerling potatoes.  What an incredible culinary feast - each dish was carefully prepared, delicious, and the presentation was fabulous!  We will make this a regular stop when we're in Scottsdale.  Thank you to Crudo's wonderful chefs, Cullen Campbell and Brandon Crouser for creating such an incredible menu and making our evening so memorable!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Staff, menu, service, ambiance, all wonderful. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Antipastis were good. We had the pig ears and beets with goat cheese. Everything else was meh. From the ahi to the yellowtail, salmon, brisket, and pork belly. It was all meh."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best food I've had... This place is a little pricey, but worth the taste!"}
{"text":"Their inaugural brunch was a fantastic success!

Terry T and I met 3 of her friends here Sunday morning. We were among the first to be seated. Almost immediately after being handed the menu, I spied three items with bacon. It's one of my few talents: being able to spot \"bacon\". Anyway, while we were waiting for the rest of the group to show up, Terry and I split the bacon jar. What's a bacon jar? Glad you asked. It's a short Mason jar layered with caramelized bacon, with just the perfect amount of balsamic vinegar to give it a kick, topped with avocados and sprinkled with cheese. I might have omitted an ingredient, but the bacon is what's important here. It's served with grilled bread, but only two slices so Terry and I had no choice but to eat the rest of the jar--that didn't fit on the grilled bread--with spoons. Life can be so tough some times.

I ordered the bacon risotto with two sunny-side up eggs on top. Huge cubes of bacon, tender creamy risotto. It was grand. Generally, I prefer my eggs over easy and only the yolks runny. So it was a different experience. But it worked smartly and was delicious!

The prices, as I understand, are considerably lower for brunch."}
{"text":"Had a 40th anniversary dinner at Crudo last night. Our first time there. Magnificent meal, great service. Had the butterfish and ahi tuna from the raw section. From the cooked choices, had the risotto and the gnocchi. Shared the cheese selection with dates, had veal breast and shortribs from the grilled section and shared the chocolate tiramisu for dessert, with coffee. Were guided by our knowledgable waitress. Also had two great cocktails, while sharing pig ears. Pacing of courses were perfect. Our favories were pig ears, both raw selections, the gnocchi, risotto, and shortribs. These were spectacular, the other choices were also very good. Thanks Crudo for a special evening."}
