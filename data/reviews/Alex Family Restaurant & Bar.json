{"text":"Went for a later breakfast last weekend and since this place was right around the corner from my place figured I'd finally try it out.

The decor is simple nothing to brag about or complain about.

I got the menu and to my surprise the breakfast was all in the front. I was expecting to flip through a few pages (because it's quite the task.)   I ended up just getting there special which was; 3 Eggs, 2 Sausages, 2 Pieces of bacon home fries and toast. $7.99. And it was delicious!

Since I didn't exactly order from the menu just a quick glance I didn't have a chance to look for the spelling errors - darn! 

Service was fast, the place was clean and the food was delicious.  It was never packed but the business continued to come and go.

So 4 stars."}
{"text":"I took a picture last weekend of this cardboard sign posted on the corner saying \"Breakfast Special + Coffee $3.99\" .  It caught my attention for all the wrong reasons.  Since I am winding down my time here, I decided what the heck, let me try this place knowing full well I would be reviewing this place anyway.  

I walked in and the decor hasn't changed from the previous owners of Thyme 4 Pizza and Pasta.  So already a hasty opening.  I was greeted by a friendly waitress of Eastern European descent.  Not even could I sit down and take off my jacket before she asked me if I wanted coffee.   For me I'm an orange juice kind of guy.  She comes back and brings me a small bottle of Everfresh bottle of orange juice with a glass and straw asking me for ice.  In the background, a religious radio station with some hick was in the background.  C'mon really? That already put me in a foul mood.

Onto the menu.  At quick glance I was expecting the breakfast at the front of the menu since there was a poster saying all day breakfast.  So it was all the way in the back of the menu.  The menu itself was 4 pages long with a concoction of Greek and Italian dishes.  So on one side of the 3rd page in the bottom left hand corner was the Breakfast Specials 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Then the rest of the 4th page were the other breakfast dishes.  

I ordered some Alex's breakfast special with home fries, choice of diced meat and eggs.  It came back with cheese all over the home fries and the sausage was not diced.  The toast was kind of dry and the eggs were the best part about it.  I left there with a bit of a headache probably with all the oil cooked with the \"home fries.\"  For some reason those fries reminded me of Kougelis (?).  

So I guess I paid the price for not going to Hasty Market and buying some milk for my cereal.  Maybe I did need some divine intervention after visiting this place."}
{"text":"As Andre D mentioned, the first thing I noticed when I walked in was that the decor is exactly the same as the previous tenant \"Thyme for Pizza\".

The service was very quick and the waitress was very attentive and made sure we always has what we needed.

I also find it odd that for a place that markets itself as an all day breakfast joint, the breakfast menu is on pages 7 & 8. The rest of the menu is a mashup of different Mediterranean cuisines.

Since I'm not a fan of eggs, I opted for the French toast breakfast special. It was decent and for $6 I got French toast, bacon and coffee. Beware of the bacon though; it comes extra extra crispy, which is how I like it. But if you like it more on the rubbery side, make sure you let them know ahead of time.

Overall, Alex's is a pretty average breakfast joint. On a side note, their menu is filled with typos, which is quite hilarious (I.e. Kids menu is good for 12\" and under???)."}
{"text":"Move over King Slice {1} there is a new threat to the English language and it's called Alex Family Restaurant! If I didn't know better I would say this place has gone out of their way to use and abuse the written word with no less than 67, yes 67 spelling mistakes, grammar mistakes and nonsensical items in their menu. 

I'll be the first to admit I am not the best speller... English is my third language and I know that things slip once and a while but that many mistakes is laughable; some of my favourites include:

* Parmessan cheese
* homemade garlic [did they mean garlic bread?]
* Fresh Stir Fry/Veggie Stir-Fry [Apparently stir-fry is hyphenated only when served with veggies... that may or not be fresh according to your options!]
* Homemade Lasagna. An excellent tradition [This is the only description provided!]
*Tender breast of chicken
*Ex-cheese [I guess it used to be cheese... what is it now?]
* Enjoyable meals for 12\" and under [listed under Kids Things... get your head out of the gutter!]

Ok now on to the food! For a place that serves all day breakfast you would think breakfast should appear first on their menu as opposed to burying it on the last three pages of a nine page menu. I ordered Alex's Breakfast; it was ok and the portions were huge. I liked the home fries a lot which surprised me since they ended up tasting better than the omelette.

Service was very attentive... maybe even too attentive! It seemed like every two seconds someone was coming by to see if everything was ok. All in all everything was descent but skip the orange juice, they serve you a bottle of Sunny D!

My biggest complaint is the TVs, which I guess is understandable for a breakfast joint but they seem really out of place for a non-dinner atmosphere.
