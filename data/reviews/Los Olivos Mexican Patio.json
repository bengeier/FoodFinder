{"text":"Large restaurant close to Old Town and Arts District of Scottsdale. Very good traditional Mexican food.  Two kinds of salsa and chips.  Large portions."}
{"text":"Thank God I live in California!  Home of REAL Mexican food!.   I read all the mixed reviews about this place before we went there--so we knew it was risky--even though Los Olivos was recommended by our hotel Concierge and hotel shuttle driver... I should tell you that I am a professional chef--although that may mean that my standards and expectations are high--they are, BUT I look for the basics just like everyone else:  ingredients,taste, presentation, service, ambience, etc.  Ambience=FAIL it was dirty.  Computer ethernet and other cabling crawling all over the place and detracting from the what should have been overall charm of the place. Too much unnecessary clutter. The place is old and funky , but you can maximize on that and (with a little thought and planning) use it to an advantage, and make the place a landmark--they dropped the ball on that one.= FAIL  What's with the chips??? instead of small dipping bowls with BOTH a (fresh) green and red salsa we were given thin stale chips (cold) and small carafes of (canned) pico de gallo to be poured on top of the chips? = FAIL.  When I try a \"new\"  Mexican restaurant for the first time I usually order a \"barometer\" plate that should be indicative of the way the rest of the menu dishes are prepared.  In this case:  Chile Verde. I ordered a chile verde burrito that came with a small side salad, and rice, and beans (arroz y frijoles).  Our server cautioned us that the plates were super hot--this is good, and thye were probably put under a broiler or salamander for a few minutes prior to takeout.  BUT we were dissapointed:  The medium-size diced pieces of pork were dark gray in color, dry and chewy=FAIL  they should be bigger in size and chunkier, moist and juicy with lots of salsa verde.  The flour tortilla was dry, tough=FAIL  Cheese: Cheddar NOT Monterey Jack (this is a big no-no) cold and thick not hot and oozy=FAIL   Rice:  cold, crunchy, and dry = FAIL  should be hot, fluffy, and moist.  Beans:   warm with no texture=FAIL they should look like beans or refried beans hot, and have good taste and texture.  The small side salad on the same plate had no dressing whatsoever (hey c'mon add/spoon a tablespoon of bottled Italian dressing -anything, jeezus!) and only one black olive for garnish=FAIL.   The Victoria beer I ordered (the \"waitress\" was not sure they carried it) was not ice cold. I sampled all the items on the plate, but ultimately passed on the Chile Verde=FAIL By the time our shuttle driver dropped us off at the hotel I wasn't feeling that well, and I think I know why. **Next time you are near Salinas, CA where I live, go to Rosita's (/row/zee/tahz/).  Then you will know what I am talking about.  Buen Provecho!  Glenn"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Loved the guacamole, salsa and my Margarita. I must try when in Scottsdale Az."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, overpriced, poor quality Mexican food. Nothing at all memorable about this place. The refried beans were bland and the rice overcooked and mushy. Everything is was smothered in cheese, which can be a good thing, but not with flour (flour!) tortillas.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food. We were expecting authentic Mexican food and got hot garbage.The cocktails were the only highlight."}
{"text":"So today me and a friend decided to go out to eat at around 5:30 ish so he suggested to go to Los Olivos and I was like sure lets give it a try once we got there we were greeted by the guy up front he asked us where we wanted to sit so we said anywhere is fine,one of his servers was nearby and he asked him if he could seat us and serve us and he said \"I GUESS\" could've been more nice, we decided to start with some queso in the menu it had the option of either medium or large the server didn't even ask which we wanted he just brought out the large one,we were like ok it's cool,we looked over the menu some more until we decided to get some chimichangas the server suggested we add beans and rice without even saying it was an extra charge,we asked for a side of sour cream instead we received a huge spoonful of sour cream on top of our chimichanga,the rice was dry and had no flavor the beans were really really dry and the lettuce that came with the plate was hot and looked really old,we got asked if we were okay ONCE the servers helper came to refill our drinks like 2 times without even asking if we wanted a refill and when he came he didn't even talk after the server was done helping a huge group he came to drop off our check without even asking if we were done or if we wanted desert, we waited for 10 minutes and he never came back to pick up our cards to pay for the bill so we decided to get up and start walking out until we saw the greater in the door,we asked who we were supposed to give our cards too and he said I guess I can take care of it, when he charged us we asked if we could split the tab and he responded with I don't know if I can do that,he eventually figured out how to do it.           The food is really bad the service is bad the employees are walking around with shorts, and earrings on and tattoos I don't have anything against that it's just that I don't feel like they should work like that, the only reason they got a 1 star is because their lemonade was good, never going back again"}
{"text":"Although the atmosphere here is quaint with its live mariachi band, the guy with the rose bucket coming around, and the dim lighting, the food is just...meh.  I went here on the recommendation of a friend I was with and had brought some out-of-town guests here for dinner one night, and I kind of wish I hadn't.  First off, I walk in, and the hostess asks how many people are in my party, so I tell her four, and she says to hold on and leaves.  I thought maybe she was getting menus or whatever, but no.  I'm waiting and waiting, and then, I look over and see her standing at a different hostess desk.  Um...hello.  I thought you were getting me a table.  I'm not really sure what her purpose was cuz the entrance was getting full, and she just stood there.  Finally, an older manager-ish man came out, saw the people, and got another girl to start seating people.    Once seated, I started to peruse the menu.  There was some Los Olivos special on there, and I was really confused by it because it was really a sour cream-filled enchilada with some cheese on top for $11.  Really?  I could make that myself for roughly $4.  I ended up getting a combination of 1 chicken and 1 beef enchilada, but I couldn't really tell the difference when it came out since it was all kind of hidden under a ton of melted cheese.  When a stranger at the next table asked what was good here, one of my out-of-town guests was like, It doesn't really matter what you get if you get a special because it all kind of comes as one mess on a plate.  That might sound enticing to some of you out there, but I promise you, it's not messy in an awesome way.  It all had the same texture and taste, and I wasn't even sure what that texture and taste was really.  It was kind of awkward, actually.  Afterward, my friend who suggested the place was like, I swear it was better last time I came, but for some reason, it wasn't good today.  He even went so far to say that if he were a Yelp!er, he'd have given the place three stars.  I, however, am giving it two because, really, I've had much better Mexican food around these parts with better parking, better chips and dip, and better everything.  Kind of disappointed in you, Los Olivos.  PS: If you do decide to go here and try it out, know that they DO NOT split checks."}
{"text":"The green chili quesadilla is amazing! Service fantastic and the atmosphere is so authentic and southwestern. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Must have hit at inconvenient time.  Service was bad and food was less than average.  Tasted like leftovers   Will not return!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last weekend.... our server was very friendly and accommodating.  We had a small dog with us, which they allowed on the patio.  I ordered a regular margarita on the rocks, some bean dip, and the carne asada burrito.  The salsa they put on the table with the chips was outstanding.  (I assume they make it in house).  My margarita was meh, ok.  I am not a fan of super sweet and it was on the sweet side.  I am assuming they use a mix there, and not fresh lime juice :( I didn't care for the bean dip.. the carne asada burrito was delicious, just needed more meat in my opinion.  The ratio of tortilla to meat was up there.  We also ordered sopapillas for dessert at the end of the meal.  I was NOT a fan.  The cinnamon and sugar were half assed sprinkled on there and not coated completely.  Tasted like a bland donut... save for the honey packets they served us.  Honey PACKETS?? lol.  Overall it was meh.  I gave it 4 stars though cause our server was really nice :)"}
{"text":"Where I come from in the Northeast, we don't have this authentic of Mexican food so I was a big fan. The salsa and nachos were AMAZING, the best I've ever had. That could've sufficed as my dinner and I'd be happy. I got the chicken fajitas which I really enjoyed. I'm sure there are better Mexican places out there but for someone like me, it was perfect."}
{"text":"Exceptional margaritas!!  The shrimp fajitas are wonderful, and you can't beat the old town location. Great place to pop in after art walk ."}
{"text":"I don't really know what to say. I ordered a carne asada burrito and it was just ok. The meat didn't have that much flavor and there was nothing else in it- just bland meat and the tortilla. The best part was the tortilla and the red sauce which was actually hot. I love hot sauce that is actually hot! Lol  it's going to be hard for me to eat there again because there wasn't a taste to crave. :("}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch; burrito - enchilada style, red. The food was respectable but not great. However the chips and salsa were very good and the price was right! I kind of liked the decor also."}
{"text":"AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS!  The worst Mexican food I've ever had.  I even ate there another time to give it another chance (everyone at work raves about it!) and still found it disgusting.  The beans are the worst that I've ever had (you can taste the lard!)."}
{"text":"After eating here I am now on a quest to find a Mexican restaurant that is just as good & authentic in NYC. They give you two different types of salsa with your chips & the salsa is incredibly fresh. I got the a la carte chicken empanada, fish taco & green corn tamale. I really enjoyed the juicy & natural flavors of the chicken... I've never had chicken empanada this good before. The green sauce on top was just enough to add some flavor without overpowering the dish. I got the fish taco on a soft tortilla rather than a hard shell & it was really delicious. The tamale was what I would've expected out of a tamale... nothing too exciting about it but it was still good.  The place was very packed & since the restaurant is a little ways from the main road in Old Town I suspect that it was mostly locals in there (we were visiting from out of town). The restaurant was much larger on the inside than I expected so we got seated relatively quickly... and the host seemed like he had a blast working there! Service was good & we never felt rushed. I really miss this place."}
{"text":"There was a time in Scottsdale when its citizens roamed free, able to go out without being hunted by cougars, or come face to face with D-bags and 30K Millionaires. It was a peaceful place, where the majority of people engaged in simple crafts like weaving cotton and forging horseshoes. And it was into this community that the prescient Corrall family came, making there way north from the Mexican state of Sonora in 1919. They built an adobe structure on the outskirts of town under olive trees which was used for many purposes. Obviously aware that Scottsdale would burgeon into a world-class resort town, the family decided to open a restaurant to serve traditional Mexican cuisine and capitalize on the growing popularity of things like Cheech Marin and ponchos.  Today, however, someone walking into the \"Patio\" will likely say to himself or herself: \"This is probably going to be like eating at Acapulco\". And unfortunately nothing could be farther from the truth. Los Olivos is described as an \"institution\" but you'd never guess by that reputation how low the ceilings are. As the Corralls expanded the property so too did it enhance the labyrinthine characteristic of the restaurant. Yet this growth is positive: I've never had to wait for a table. While I've been seated in various rooms, there isn't one that I like best. Despite reminding me a little of the Mos Eisely Cantina, it manages to stay cool and dim during the summer giving it a special allure when I first ate there.   The service is probably the most unusual you will find in Scottsdale. You will find no pushiness here, you will also find lots of bilingual servers who can handle your order in both Spanish and English. And yes, because it's been around forever some of the servers have been too. They may seem a little distant, but it's only because this is one of those places in the 'dale that caters to the whole city and as such has a very diverse clientele.  Undoubtedly you'll notice that like Acapulco, Los Olivos loves to promote its fajitas and margaritas. But the fact is, they do an excellent job of offering a wide variety of dishes such that you can eat here often and not have to order the same thing. Moreover they are fairly consistent in keeping the menu Sonoran in focus. This will sound pedestrian, until you realize that Mexican cuisine suffers the same image problem that Chinese does. Namely when only certain areas of the country could immigrate, they had a disproportionate impact on how the cuisine was represented in the U.S. And so the Patio sticks mainly to beef and some chicken with only a few plates using seafood.   This is also one of the places biggest complaints: that this authentic Sonoran food is as bland as a telenovela adapted for American TV. But this is actually why you know you it's not Margarita Monday: US chains are known to add such high level of sugar to recipes as to make dishes artificially sweet. The food here is not sweet at all, and hence good news for your pre-diabetes, but bad news for your craven palette. (European tourists take note, disregard these comments.)  Yet I found myself going to Los Olivos in the first place because of the price. Yes, this is an affordable restaurant. Some entrees are less than $10 and give one an economical choice amidst the orgy of maxed out credit cards in Old Town. Parking is also free and convenient because it is adjacent to a large, city-owned structure for the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art.  Perhaps the greatest irony with is that the once trendsetting Corrals are portrayed today as conservative with their restaurant's image. But no matter, as Scottsdale treasures its history as much as being hip. So Los Olivos remains a good bet if you're looking for something staid. And if you are not, there's always Cowboy Ciao."}
{"text":"Best mushroom enchilada's in town! I am always so baffled by the crappy chain restaurants getting good reviews, and the small local restaurants getting bad reviews.  This is one of those places the service kinda sucks, emphasize kinda, but the food it so good it doesn't matter. The salsa is yummy, and they have great chips.  Stop your chain addiction  and try out one of these great local favorites!  Oh for those of you who are looking for a healthy Mexican option, stick with Rubio's. This is good ol' authentic, greasy yummy Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great salsa.  Everything else is pretty mediocre and flavorless. Nothing that makes this place stand out from a Rositas or Garcias."}
{"text":"Visiting from northern cal. This was a great restaurant in old town Scottsdale. My wife had the fish tacos and I had the carne asada. Both very good. I wish we had a place like this where we live."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch.  Not impressed at all. We sat at the bar.  Bartendar was accommodating but not friendly at all.  The hot salsa was good.  Not too much of a kick but tasty. Mild salsa was watery and not much flavor.  Chips were good and thin.  Started out with the house margarita.  It was awful.  So,  I got the Cadillac margarita which was much better.  I got the shredded beef burro enchilada style.  It was edible but lacked flavor.  My friend got the chicken enchilada and the green corn tamale.  She said the enchilada was bland and the tamale was extremely sweet.  Won't be returning here on my own free will."}
{"text":"I've been going to Los Olivos for over 50 years, actually started going when it was Hacienda Corral on Scottsdale Rd. I grew up on Mexican food and Los Olivos is the best authentic by far! Many of the staff are still there since I was young, this is a family business and such great people! Love Los Olivos, so many great memories along with the food!"}
{"text":"This was my firat time at the original los olivos. I was just as un wowed as the north location. Sadly there isn't a single thing that I can point out that was bad.....but nothing was that good either. We had a largish party and I arrived late. It was an early dinner on a Saturday night so no waiting and the table already had chips and salsa on the table when I got there. I am not eating chips but everyone else seemed to like theirs. I thought the salsa was very shallow in its flavor. I like a deeper more roasted flavor. I asked for lemon with my water and he brought me a whole plate. I struggled to find the right thing to eat that wouldn't throw me completely off my no starch low sugar diet. I ended up with a chicken tostada a la cart and left the tortilla. It was perfect for me and pretty tasty. I know others were underwhelmed. I wouldn't \"not\" eat there again if others were going but I think I would rather try restaurants with a stronger point of view anc commitment to excellence."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best cheese crisps. Food is always good. We come here two to three times a month."}
{"text":"A historical Scottsdale treasure and definitely one of its most unique restaurants. From the front door donkey to the blue-tinted aquarium area to the Diego Rivera replicated art in the old Mexican adobe main dining room, it is a neat place to eat.  However, if you are looking for great Mexican food in Arizona, it would not be my first choice. The service is fast and friendly and I love the mariachi band and occasional live music however the food is less than desirable. My favorite meal is the Pollo a La Queso Crema but sometimes the chicken is dry and the rice and beans are crusty from sitting too long on a hot plate. There is a definite difference in quality when the restaurant is busy, so timing can be everything. It's a great spot to get a margarita after a Giants Spring Training game but for a good meal, it's just okay."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever, and I'm sure due to the building itself.  It has the fabulous dome room with blue stained glass ovals all over the ceiling. There's a cute romantic two seater in the corner too, away from everyone else. I got the mini chimi's, and my date got the carne burrito. He said it needed more beef, but that it wasn't too spicy, which means bland as he doesn't have any idea what spicy is. ;) My chimi's were over cooked, and more tortilla than actual contents. So go for the atmosphere, but don't expect much from the food."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but the food was bland.  It was disappointing because I was really craving some great Mexican food.  There were two types of salsa provided with chips, neither were spicy. I ordered beef enchiladas with rice and beans. My plate was covered with so much cheese, I couldn't tell the items apart. Even with all the cheese the food was still bland. Decent prices, but don't expect much if you're looking for authentic Mexican flavor."}
{"text":"Los Olivos is a Scottsdale institution and I won't hear a word against them. Especially not when I have a few margaritas in me. They take good care of regulars, especially at Happy Hour. The chips and salsa are delicious and they keep them coming. I recommend the mini menu, they are a great way to sample stuff if you like to try a lot of different things, but my favorite meal is definitely the Chicken Poblano. Mmm, so good! The shrimp chimi is also fantastic. I never leave without feeling totally stuffed."}
{"text":"Dinner on the patio of chicken fajitas and the los olivos special. Fantastic! !!"}
{"text":"Second time here and not disappointed at all. The folks here know how to provide the best in authenticity. The food, atmosphere and service are all top notch. Had combo #1 this time. Excellent! Always enjoy the Phoenix layovers thanks to Los Olivos."}
{"text":"The food is dreadful.  Its greasy, dried out, bland and oil laden.  We were even lucky enough to get a taco with a long black hair baked into the shell.  I think people want to truly love this place because its a landmark and has been around for so long, but honestly - it's just plain bad.  Beans with the dried crusting edges, watered down salsa, cheese crisp that you have to mop the oil off of, enchilada sauce congealing with the oil slick sheen on top and meat with fat globs clumped into it.  Seriously, if you are even considering mexican food - avoid this place.  I am truly baffled by the amount of 4 and 5 stars for this place...."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday early afternoon for my mother's birthday since my dad was in the hospital down the street.  Service was ridiculously slow and there weren't more than 20 people in the place. We were a party of three and we saw the waitress a total of four times in the hour it took us to eat and get out.  Asked twice for drink refills and never did get them.  Had to flag a busboy down with a water pitcher just to get that.  Seemed like plenty of staff on hand, they just didn't seem to be paying attention to the diners. Food was blah and pretty tasteless.  Prices seemed high for the quality of food.  The place looks really run down, light fixtures were filthy and half the light bulbs were burned out.  Overall the whole place looked very worn and dirty.  We've gone there for years, but won't be back again any time soon. Not a great experience at all."}
{"text":"Being from NM originally, I hate TEX MEX and this is authentic stuff with red chili pepper sauce.  This place does not rate higher due to being a little dirty and bad wait staff.  The food speaks for itself and it is hard to find good tamales which they have."}
{"text":"All cheese & sauce so if that's your thing then.....  A little too heavy for lunch if you have to go back to work. Service was a little slow but cordial. Cool building!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Had the chicken chimichanga, loaded with chicken.  My only complaint, a bit pricy for what you get. I kind of thought that would be the case as the website showed no prices on the menu.  I've had food just as good, but much more reasonably priced in my opinion. Just be aware of \"sticker shock \" if you go. Service was good. I gave it 3 stars for \"value\""}
{"text":"I seriously can't believe people have given this less than 5 stars. I'd give it 10 if I could! We asked a shop owner for a great mexican restaurant and he recommended this one, and we're so glad we did. The salsa was BY FAR the freshest I've ever had. You could smell the ripe tomatoes. The carafes didn't bother me - I thought it was a great idea, so you didn't have to worry about double dipping with friends; they provide you with a plate to scoop up your own serving.   I had the steak Tacos Al Carbon - the meat was so tender and tasted like it had just come off a charcoal grill. The rice was the most flavorful I've ever tasted. My friends had a veggie enchilada which looked great, even though I'm not a vegetarian, and a combo platter which I was a little jealous of - looked like a perfect selection! I went back a second time before leaving Arizona, and got the green corn tamale, which was incredible!  The service was Superman fast! Usually you get bored with chips and salsa before they bring your entree but here, I had barely dug into the chips before I got my entree!  I honestly can't think of a bad thing about this place!"}
{"text":"I ate here w/my good friend 5/31/14. I generally hate Mexican food, but love the fajitas at Los Olivos!  We sat down, ordered a few drinks & were promptly brought chips & salsa to snack on while looking over the menu. The salsa was very good & we both liked the chips but kept adding more salt. It was nice they didn't come coated in case someone doesn't like or can't have sodium.  Our server, Erika, came by twice to see if we were ready to order. We asked for more time. She was very kind & left us alone until we called her back.  I'm a picky eater & modify most orders when eating out. I get nervous requesting modifications because 75% of the time the food comes out wrong. I was pleasantly surprised when everything came out absolutely PERFECT!! The fajita pans were sizzling & everything smelled amazing!   We both got the steak & chicken combo fajitas cooked w/onions, tomatoes and green & red bell peppers. They also come with the most amazing refried beans covered in cheese, guacamole and sour cream. I also ask for shredded cheese & lettuce to put on the tortilla to make a sort-of 'soft taco' It was all absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  Erika came by to make sure we were ok & brought out the additional tortillas we requested along w/more wine & told us to let her know if we needed anything else. We enjoyed our meal & never felt rushed she wanted to turn the table because it was 6:30 on a Saturday.  I complimented Erika for making us feel welcome, not rolling her eyes when I ordered, bringing out everything correctly, always smiling & being overall wonderful. I also asked for her manager to let him know how wonderful she is. He must've thought I was going to complain about something & was very pleases to hear the kind words & compliments about Erika.  Every time I go back to Los Olivos, I will request to sit in Erika's section!!"}
{"text":"Food was not that great.  Chips and salsa were good.  Chicken buritto was mediocre."}
{"text":"My hubby and I recently moved from OR to AZ and have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant in the area, so we wanted to try Los Olivos. We had dinner at Los Olivos this evening and were very dissappointed of the food quality and taste!! We had sopes as an appetizer and as a main entry, my hubby had camarones al mojo de ajo (shrimps in garlic) and I had Flautas Ana. We didn't like any of these dishes we tried. :( Too greasy and no good taste! We are not coming back at all!  Service was okay."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite Mexican food places, but my 3 star review is for the service. Every time I have walked in the door, no one has been at the front desk to greet or seat. Sometimes the line gets so long that people start to question if anyone runs the place! The servers in the dining room rarely check in, and often forget about what you asked them to get for you. Thankfully, the bus boy comes around and you can ask him for things you need. Regardless of the poor service, it's great, fresh Mexican food."}
{"text":"We come to Scottsdale every December and Los Olivos is on our 'must eat at' list. Excellent beans, rice, tortillas, steak picado, and enchiladas."}
{"text":"Fajitas here are sooo good! Can't speak for any of the other dishes because I refuse to try anything else!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for the past 20 years and they NEVER lose their quality. My favorite is the Chicken Enchiladas with red sauce. It is so authentic and delicious- I have not been able to find these kinds of enchiladas anywhere else.   My parents usually get the chicken chimi enchilada style, and think it is the greatest thing on their menu. I would opt for the chicken enchiladas. Remember Mexican food is heavy, so go with a good appetite. Portions are quite large, too.  Setting is very old-but has been family operated forever.  Great to go casually or to enjoy some real mexican food!!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the difference between Los Olivos and Taco Bell except that,  1.Taco Bell doesn't charge 15$ for a plate of bad nachos, and, 2.At least when they ignore me at Taco Bell I can honk my horn.  Either way, you're better off at Chipotle."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's an Old Town staple and it never disappoints. The margs are strong, the enchiladas are on point and I've never had bad service here. Get the crunchy machaca taco and cheese enchilada PLUS the Cadillac Marg (aka The Date Rape Marg) and you're set! Ha!"}
{"text":"To be completely honest, it's been 3 years since I've been there but I still dream about this place. The best tortillas ive ever had. Not even close."}
{"text":"Tucked in a quiet corner of Old Town Scottsdale, Los Olivos is the kitschy landmark best known as the oldest Authentic Mexican restaurant in the area.  Upon first look, the building, built in the 1950's is spewing charm. Designed by the Grandfather of the current owners, the space is architecturally pleasing and interesting to the eye.  Unfortunately, the building wears it age. The stucco walls and dated floors are stained from fiestas gone by.  During my visit, I happily watched as the highly intuitive and competent wait staff wiped down mirrors and did basic cleaning between serving the few occupied tables throughout the dining areas.  The complimentary chips were crisp and salty, and the salsas, although a tad watery, were perfectly spiced and served in carafes, making for a table full of messy plates. The Carne Asada meal was served with a green salad, yellow rice, a giant fresh cooked tortilla, rough chopped pico de gallo and refried beans. The green salad was surprisingly filling and topped with a gratuitous serving of shredded cheese. The Carne Asada was well seasoned, although for the price ($16), I found the meat to be a bit tough and overall underwhelming. The mushroom enchiladas were again, decent and large, but not worth the price of $14.  I would describe the food at Los Olivos as comfort food: a salty, cheesy, plate of fatty goodness that would cure a hangover or call for a mid-day nap. The service was friendly and welcoming, and the building's kitschy design makes for great photo opportunities. All in all, the pricing is consistent with Old Town Scottsdale, yet not on par with the quality of food. If you are looking for Authentic Mexican food that will blow you away, I would try elsewhere. However, I would recommend Los Olivos for the atmosphere and attentive service. I'm looking forward to returning for a night of Margaritas and appetizers. Los Olivos' charm is the perfect companion for an evening of laughing and drinking with friends."}
{"text":"I came to this place on a date as my date wanted something to eat and she mentioned this restaurant was in the area. I am very picky with Mexican food and I knew as soon as I walked in this was not authentic Mexican food even if it had Mexican people working there. It's you typical \"Americanized\" Mexican food place, I ordered the chimichanga and for the price (nearly $13) it was overpriced. I could of gone to a juliobertos or polibertos and gotten that same dish with guacamole and sour cream which the Los Olivos plate did not come with for about $9 including the drink and I would of been better off. My date had the flautas as which were bland to say the least. The service was descent which is why I gave them 2 stars, the salsa was bland and their spicy salsa was a joke. I think I was the only Mexican person eating there which was a red flag."}
{"text":"This place gets 2 stars because the building itself is trippy and cool--check out the blue window skylights in a Gaudi esque configuration--and the super fresh salsa. My lunch, on the other hand, was super lackluster (a la carte spinach enchilada and chile relleno). But I'll go back, just for margaritas, kick ass salsa, and a building that sets a cool mood."}
{"text":"Great service at the bar. Chicken fajitas were great! Just had some from another restaurant (which I won't name) in the last week which were very bland. Los Olivos ones were full of meat and very tasty along with all the sides. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome fajitas! Fresh made tortillas are amazing, and I use that word sparingly. Great place."}
{"text":"Slow service and the food was just ok. The one GIANT tortilla with the fajitas made them hard to eat and the tortillla chips were super greasy. Should have listened to the yelp consensus but I think even that was overly generous. I won't be back."}
{"text":"AWESOME chips and salsa! I ordered the Carne Asada steak and it was cooked perfectly! Their double Cadillac margaritas are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Must get: fish tacos, guacamole, and chips and salsa!!!!! Soooooo good! It's a fun place if you are in the mood for some great Mexican food :) gotta try their chicken salad next... It looked Amazeballs!"}
{"text":"Oh Mary Lou how I love you!  I still don't know how this dish came to be called the Mary Lou, but I don't care what it is called...it is sooo good!  A cheese quesadilla covered in a delicious green beef chile sauce....it is so indulgent, but it is worth it!  They sure don't skimp on the cheese here and the beef in the chile is so tender it just melts in your mouth.  Add on a side of their delicious beans and you have yourself a tasty meal.  Be prepared to share (or just have lots of leftovers) cause this thing is huge!  The best part is during happy hour you can get it for half price!  The tacos, enchiladas and beans are also top notch here.  I would also have to say the plain old cheese crisp is one of the best ones out there, always crispy and not skimpy on the cheese!  I just wish they had a parking space for take-out orders!"}
{"text":"great food and the service was excellent. I was surprised at how cheap the price was when the bill finally came. I know MExican food rlaly fills you up but we left there very satisfied and we were not broke! We will definately be back."}
{"text":"This place is gross the food taste like a can of dog food !!!! The meat looks like horsemeat not recommending don't ever go here!!!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a drink prior to a ballgame...ritas just lots of sweet and sour mix....bartender very unfriendly to everyone around us."}
{"text":"happy hour is good. free munchies in the bar area, like cheese crisps, mexi pizza, quesadillas, (chips & salsa anytime), cheap domestic drafts.  margaritas are good.  other food is perty good, sides are pricey, as a side of guac is like 4 bucks.  3-7p is the right time to go."}
{"text":"I base a lot of my opinion on the chips and salsa the mexican food restaurant sets down in front of me.  I LOVE their hot sauce.  The salsa is standard, but the hot sauce is delicious and I crave it (I live in SD so I don't get to Los as much as I used to).    Their cheese crisp is also a treat.  They do it right there with fresh tortillas and a crunch instead of the flimsy crap other mexican food restaurants try to sling at ya.    I will say that it's standard catering to the gringo masses mexican food, but it at least has more flavor than other bland restaurants I've been to (I have yet to find a decent mexican food place in SD)  I LOVE their shredded beef taco.  That's all I ever order.  I also love the restaurant itself.  I would recommend to those looking for decent mexican food in a nice atmosphere.  Parking tip: Use the parking garage instead of searching for street or lot parking."}
{"text":"One a short day trip to Scottsdale, we found Los Olivos Restaurant. Without knowing its history or menu, we ventured in and we're pleasantly surprised. The food was excellent and authentic. We had the tacos and the tamales. The tamales were incredibly flavorful.  The prices were reasonable. This is a perfect Mexican restaurant for a date, family gathering, or intimate night out with friends...not flashy but very friendly (family-owned)."}
{"text":"Nice place. But the food is way to greasy for me. Everyone seemed very friendly with lots of regulars here. Got the taco plate and lots of grease and way too much cheese. The salsa was also nothing great. Our whole party were in agreement that the food wasn't that good. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Sooo...I was in Scottsdale for the day to visit a friend who was also visiting the city (she's from Texas and I recently moved to Tucson).  They had already been in town a few days and we were walking around Old Town looking for a place to eat.  We wanted to get Mexican, since after all, this is Arizona, and so I thought to ask someone working at a local business where a good place to go would be.  Without hesitation the woman/local pointed us towards this place, saying \"it's the only place in town with good Mexican food.\"  Now, after having experienced it, I must say, if this is the best Scottsdale has to offer, they're in pretty bad shape and should be kicked out of Arizona.    The breakdown:  The interior and exterior of the place are very authentic and interesting architecturally.  This is about the only thing that really \"wowed\" us about the place.  We were a party of three (me, my friend and her mom).  The tortilla chips were \"meh\"  and the salsas, pretty bland and forgettable. My friend ordered the fish tacos, her mom, the taco salad (with chicken), and myself the cheese and mushroom enchiladas.  All of the items were quite bland.  I had to seriously douse my order in hot salsa just to give it \"some\" flavor, the rice was flavorless and clumpy and looked like it was cooked a week prior, the beans, also flavorless.  With the addition of the hot salsa my dish was mediocre.    The servers we had didn't ask how our food was (probably because she- or they- already knew it wasn't very good), my friend and her mom didn't even want to pack their food to go, it was that bad.     Now, I lived in Chicago for 18 years before my recent move to Tucson, and there are many Mexican places that would put this place to shame, and this is in the freaking Midwest!     Also, the food is overpriced.  It's about the quality of a Chi-Chi's (are those even still around?) but double the price.   Having read through the reviews it seems the place was once very good (and reasonably priced) but this clearly isn't the case any longer.  Finally, anyone claiming that the food is authentic, is deceiving you.  That wasn't my main contention, however (I do live in Tucson after all, which has no shortage of authentic Mexican) as I have no problem with Americanized Mexican if it's at least good.  But I can definitely see it being a disappointment to someone who may be visiting Arizona from another part of the country and looking forward to authentic Mexican food.  So, if you want mediocre, overpriced Mexican food, and happen to be in Scottsdale, this is your Mecca.  Otherwise go to the Chipotle -their food is at least  flavorful, and you won't feel you got ripped off...."}
{"text":"So it starts like this. I walk in and see two counters with people standing at them. The first has a girl standing there wiping down a menu. She looks up and doesn't say anything. I ask if we can be seated and she still says absolutely nothing. I walk over to the other counter and stand in front of the gentleman at that counter. He stares at me, doesn't greet me, and asks, \"do you want to eat?\" Well, of course I do.   He walks passed the first of multiple open tables. He stops at the first. Shakes his head and keeps moving, goes do a second, stops, and then continues. At this point I'm really confused. It is obvious by the hosts body language he doesn't want to be there and could give two shits about his job.   After passing the third table he balks at that and places me and my son in the furthest corner table possible. He throws two menus down and I ask if he has a kids menu. No smile, no emotion, just pretty much turns and walks away. I waited about 7 or 8 minutes and he never returned. I walked to the front to find an employee but I couldn't find anyone anywhere. No joke! The same female stood there and I asked if he worked here. She looked up at me and then put her head down and totally ignored me. I was miffed but I figured Id stick it out. I walked back without the menu.  A server walked by us. Ignored us again. After about 10 minutes someone came out with waters. Let me preface this by saying there was approximately 15 people in the restaurant at this time. I asked for a kids menu again and this server finally spoke up and said they are making copies of one.    Eventually service came and we were able to order. I was l, well, pretty underwhelmed with the food. The absolutely horrible welcome and service left a sour taste which wasn't helped by average food. It was very obvious why it was dead at 6pm in downtown Scottsdale. If they ever want to survive they need to do a 180 degree turn. My recommendation would be to walk around the corner to The Mission."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here last week with a group of 6.  The orders ranged from a salad to a la carte items to full meals.  Everyone was very happy with their orders.  The salsa was very spicy but excellent (with an even spicier option available on the table).  The guacamole appetizer was large and fresh - excellent.  I had a beef tamale - one of the best I've had.  Good margaritas too.  The atmosphere is bright, very casual, and a bit touristy but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Delicious. Had the chicken flautas. Chicken in the flautas was lean and well seasoned. Just what I needed for lunch."}
{"text":"Both the cab driver and the hotel recommended Los Olivos, so I was expecting an authentic Mexican dinner. What we got was poorly flavored food and disappointment. All 8 members of my party thought their meals were sub-par. However, the bartenders were outstanding! Go for the margaritas as Miguel makes his without mix the way they should be and with fresh lime juice!"}
{"text":"Horrible prices for low quality food . I loved this restaurant but it's quality has gone down and its prices have spiked. Payed 9$ for a margarita that was in a very small glass and was served frozen tilapia In my fish tacos that cost 18$. I will not not go here  anymore !"}
{"text":"We live in Chicago & always look forward to eating at Los Olivos. Just arrived & went immediately to eat our favor entree which is the enchiladas with onions # 3 with mucho green sauce. Unfortunately the sauce had to much flour & not enough green & was short on taste! Very disappointed & probably won't go back again!!"}
{"text":"Service From Hell  I was driving to California from Utah and decided to try this restaurant. I place my order. In a short amount of time they brought out the chips and salsa. Then four employees stand near my table in a semi-circle and they continually stare at me with mincing looks. It tried my best to ignore them but they wouldn't stop. What a way to enjoy a meal! The lady waitress my screwed up my fajitas order. The food didn't taste good so I asked a male waiter if I could order guacamole which I told him I am happy to pay for. He brings me sour cream. Then a server refills my ice tea and I got was mostly ice, further diluting my drink. The waiter who gave me the sour cream kept walking by my table with a smirk on his face. I promptly paid for my food, which I did not tip, and got out of there with a large portion of uneaten food. It's one of the worst places I've eaten. ALL I CAN SAY IS, BE AWARE."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Scottsdale for a couple of nights between Christmas and new year. Told to go here and LOVED it. Service, food and drinks were all fantastic. Came back the next day we loved it so much."}
{"text":"Food okay, service is excellent.  The two major turnoffs are the flock of pigeons that swarm once a table has left, very unappealing and the $44 pitcher of margaritas.  Yes, you read that right 44 dollars for a Cadillac margarita pitcher.  When we asked the bartender what he used, he replied \"at least four or five shots\". Ah well, live and learn, I just wanted to warn others."}
{"text":"Good food, nice ambiance. Divine salsa- two sauces to choose from. Enchiladas cooked to perfection and the mariachis had us dancing the night away. Not really. Spent two great evenings here and will make it a plan to come back in the future."}
{"text":"Food was hot.  That was about it. The food was bland..  The margaritas were skunky. The service was slow.  It felt like the staff wanted to be anywhere else.  The overall appearance wasn't very clean.  Had to flag down waitress for drink refills.. Never got a chip refill.  Overall very disappointing for a place that use to be great."}
{"text":"While waiting to be seated at this neat Old Town location, I was reading the notes left by patrons. There were several that stated things like the best Mexican food in Phoenix, Best Mexican food ever. The food is good, not the best I ever had, I would rate it in the top ten Mexican places I have eaten at. I had the pork steak and it was done very good, moist juicy, with a really nice spice rub on it. Lots of food for the price. Salsa Fresca, Beans, Rice and tortilla. House Margarita was just so so. I would go back and I would recommend if you are in the Phoenix Metro area. They don't do separate checks, which sucks if you need an individual receipt for expense accounts."}
{"text":"if i could give no stars i definitely wouldn't give any !  stay away from this place !!!! stay sway from this place !!!! stay away from this place !!!! went here yesterday for my birthday dinner thinking it would be amazing, i was definitely wrong !!!  service is super slow !!!!  place is old and dirty!!!  had a waitress older women, she  as completely out of place, food was cold !!! horrible place !!!!"}
{"text":"Yah, I feel like Mexican.  Let's do Los Olivos.  I'll have a Skinny Girl Marg.  Can we get a cheese crisp, too....another Skinny girl please.  Oh yum, this pollo fundido so bomb.... Ugh I am so stuffed.\"  This is what happens every time.    The only disappointing thing about this place is the sloooowest service, ever.  I don't like the stacked chairs on the abandoned stage either.  It makes me think about how dirty it must be back there.  And I really don't like when they open the roof during business hours, especially when they do it just as I received my meal.  I can just imagine all the dust falling.  I really think they ought to commit to it being open or closed - and I vote open.  They should also consider upgrading their TVs.    Food is great, place is so-so.  Sometimes the food is worth it, and sometimes it's not.  I suppose it depends how badly I need my mexican food fix."}
{"text":"I went with my family looking for a good Mexican restaurant and we had one of the worst experiences ever with the quality of the food and it was very expensive for what we received. I don't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best hot salsa in town. The mild is average. Great old school phoenix cheese and onion enchiladas.  Love the carne asana with enchalada, but wish the price would not increase every year."}
{"text":"This place is awesome - great food, comfortable ambiance and convenient location near Scottsdale's civic center (and old-town).  The  Margaritas were flavorful (not too strong) and the wait staff was super-friendly.  We ordered the nachos for the table and I tried a burrito along with some of a fish taco and some traditional beans.  Nothing super fancy on the menu - just wholesome, authentic Mexican food.  Be sure to check out the \"blue room\" when you enter into the dining rooms... neat architecture!"}
{"text":"Despite the decor, the food was amazing.  My dad and I had the fajtas the first night we were in Scottsdale and boy were we surprised.   Our waitress was amazing as she told us a unique way to get to the Grand Canyon, which we didn't regret.  Salsa was amazing and my mom probably ate most of it.  If I ever go back, I hopefully will go back there for some Mexican.  Was there on 2/15/2012."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came into Los Olivos today and had a bartender named Miguel. He was incredibly rude to us, to the point where we felt so uncomfortable we decided to not order anything and leave the restaurant. We will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"I grew up going to Los Olivos.  Miss it so.  Especially the cheese crisps.  My favorite Mexican restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Great family place! Very good salsa. My favorite is queso with spicy pork. Yum, every time."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for over 30 years but never again. I was double billed for a meal and contacted them about it. I made many attempts and kept receiving an automated response that they would be contacting me. I still haven't heard from them concerning this matter after nearly three months of trying. I like the food but customer service is bad."}
{"text":"Rather disappointing. Service was good, that's why 2 stars. Lunch was very bland..even with green chili smothered over everything. Salsa was only thing with flavor and even when I dumped the salsa on my burrito, it was still bland. Granted it could just have been what I had, the menu had a lot of variety. Just not sure I'd go back and try something else."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and years, it was my go to place, I loved it everytime. Not anymore,  it's changed,  the food is mediocre at best and my God! I think every single plate on the menu has a price increase of at least $4. I'll never go back and that stinks cause I live about a mile from the place."}
{"text":"The margaritas were great, salsa & chips were yummy, shredded beef tacos and tamale were tasty; however, the enchiladas were a bit smothered in cheese.. couldn't really taste them.  Four stars because I haven't been to a good Mexican restaurant in a while... (live in the east coast)... plus the margaritas were really good. Ha!"}
{"text":"There is nothing terrible about this restaurant but there is nothing that good either - average food.   Given the price, it is definitely not worth it unless location is your primary concern."}
{"text":"I went there last night with a large party (10). You would think they would see a larger group and be excited and or a least kind. However everyone was pretty short and rude. We decided to stay and try out the food, even the the table was messy and the menus were greasy. All of which should have been warning signs of what was to come. What we received should not be called Mexican food. We had hot plates but cold rice and lukewarm food. When we informed our waitress of the issue she stated she would get us more rice which she did. However she didn't take the plate back, she provided us a plate to put the cold rice AFTER we had asked for the plate in which to do that. I personally ordered the Carne with an Enchilada and it was the WORSE enchilada I've ever had. I've made better ones using canned chile. The steak tasted like rubber and was very chewy. There was 0 consistency with the food seeing as though 3 people ordered the same meal and none looked or tasted the same. I live in Phx now and i was hoping to show my family a decent spot for some Mexican food. I was extremely disappointed in this place and will never go to it again nor will I recommend it. If you're thinking of coming here just go to chipotle or even Taco Bell, it will be cleaner and the food will be done with pride."}
{"text":"We used to be occasional happy customers, for probably the past 20 years or so, but had not been to Los Olivos for quite some time. Thought we would try it again.  We have been there in the past, this time of year, when you had to wait for a table. The place was not busy. What a disappointing dining experience this was. Upon entering we were rudely asked if we wanted the bar, or a table.....by someone I assume was part of the family. He looked like he was dressed to go work out at the gym. I asked for a table. We followed him to the dining room where he threw 2  menus on the table and left. Our server...an older woman that I'm sure has been there for many years....arrived, and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I ordered soda. My Hubby ordered a beer. She said someone would bring chips, salsa, water, and soda.  That person, the 'bus girl', I guess....was so stone faced and unfriendly...and practically grunted, when we said 'thank you'. No smile. Nothing. Just her demeanor screamed that she did not enjoy her job, and would gladly be anywhere else. The server returned with the beer. I ordered chicken chimi, with green sauce...rice and beans. Hubby asked for ground beef chimi, with red sauce....rice and beans. We finished the chips before the meal arrived. No one asked if we wanted more chips. Again, we would have paid extra for more chips. Hubby finally got the server's attention to order another beer. She forgot. He had to ask again. The food arrived. The server did not bother to ask if we wanted sour cream, or guacamole....as would be common in most Mexican restaurants. Nothing. And we would have gladly paid extra for both. Do they not understand how to 'up sell'??? Same with the beer. I was driving...so Hubby would have gladly downed three of them....it they had just offered it. This place needs some new wait staff, for sure. Or perhaps some real training. Both of the chimichangas were dry, bland, and tasteless. Hubby was trying to be nice and just eat his without comment. Finally, I admitted that my chicken chimi was just horrible. The burrito was not fried crisp, and was tough. There was not even a sliver of onion to be found, no seasoning at all. Just ground up 'chicken mush'...with absolutely no flavor. The same with the rice. The beans had a little bit of flavor...not much. Hubby confessed his chimi was also tasteless. Still no offer of another drink, more chips, nothing. The 'bus girl' cleared the plates away. The server came by and snatched the empty basket the chips had been in. Not a word.  No....'how was your dinner?'  Or....'can I get you anything else?'  Or...'would you care for another drink, more chips'?  She just disappeared. Finally, she brought  the check.  Two women standing behind the front counter were talking in Spanish, as we left. Neither one looked up,  acknowledged us, or bothered to say 'thanks for coming in', 'have a nice evening'....nothing.  We left....very disappointed. We won't go back. I don't know how they stay in business. Obviously, they just don't care about the customer anymore."}
{"text":"Great place for a large group! Made reservations for a very large group (nearly 30) and needed to have separate checks, and they were very accommodating. The large open area near the bar fit us easily and the tables were set up thoughtfully to allow us to be together in a group but in such a way that it was easy to get up and move around. Food was excellent, and the servers were right on top of things all the way around from getting drinks served to bringing out everyone's food at the same time, and efficiently handling the separate checks without any of the confusion that so often accompanies dining in large groups. Well done!!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  My family and friends have been eating here for at least thirty years.  The machaca is the best in town by far.  Real machaca.  Everything is good, and the atmosphere is relaxed and fun.  This feels like old school Scottsdale, in a great way.  I miss that.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! The chicken chimi I had was absolutely fantastic! The people were ridiculously nice and the salsa was obviously fresh.. Totally delicious"}
{"text":"We went here for my father's birthday. I really want to like this place. It was one of our favorite places when we moved to the area in 2003. Sadly, the overall ambiance and quality has gone downhill.  THE GOOD - The salsas were all very good and very fresh. Our waitress, Toni, was really wonderful. She has been there for decades, and her husband is part of the Corral family that owns the place. My wife got the chimichanga and she enjoyed it, although she didn't care much for the rice. My mom liked her chicken quesadilla. My dad got a fried ice cream for his birthday, that was also good. The excellent service and welcoming disposition deserved and got a 20% tip.  THE BAD - There was a hair in my salsa. The salsa itself was great, but the hair was a bummer. I ordered the fish tacos, and when they came, the fish smell was as fragrant as the funkiest clambake. Now I love sushi, and I have a couple of pounds of ceviche in my fridge. I made my peace with fish. But when it smells, well, I can't eat it. The texture was tough to the fork, too. I was sad, but I had to send it back. I dislike being a pain and sending stuff back. I was once a waiter, too, and I never want to be THAT customer to my wait staff. I ended up having a vegetarian burrito that was okay, but inside was a 1-inch-long woody stem. I usually love rice, but the rice here seemed overcooked, dry and with an oily aftertaste. It was likely in hot holding for quite some time.  In conclusion, this used to be a beautiful place. It still is, but it has been neglected. A little paint would go a long way. Some dishes could use a little more care. In spite of the variability with the food, the service was good, and I would love to see Los Olivos back to its former glory."}
{"text":"After trying many different Mexican restaurants this past year I always go back to Old Town Los Olivos.   The chips and salsa are always served right away and they deliver a spicy and mild salsa. They are refilled often and it's easy to fill up on them before your meal arrives, you've been warned!   I always get the lunch combo with a cheese enchilada, taco and all rice for around $8.50. Every time the plate is delivered the meal is hot and delicious. The rice is made the traditional Mexican way and is so yummy.   The beer selection is decent and the glasses are nice and cold. Their Coke is also really cold with lots of bubbles it doesn't have that heavy syrup taste. The cold Coke compliments the hot meal every time.   The place gets very busy so if you're eating in the dining room prepare to have a leisurely lunch. I eat at the bar and service is really fast."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over fifty years. Great variety and authentic recipes. Several staff been here for many many years. Love the sour cream enchiladas."}
{"text":"A poor example of Mexican food in Phoenix. The food was mediocre, the service terrible, and the prices far too high for this lack of quality. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas and were disappointed there as well. The margaritas lacked any real taste and we were charged $35 for the pitcher (price not listed on the menu). When we tried to voice our concerns to the manager, we were told too bad, that's the way it is. This place is just a tourist trap in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've gone to both locations in Scottsdale and they both have their own pleasant chill atmosphere. I like the North Scottsdale location a little more because it's more open and less stuffy. Lunch specials are a good deal.   I've tried a few items, but I generally get the beef tacos. The taco comes out really hot because it's fried, the taco is a little drippy with grease, but it's quite good. They get a an extra kudos from me for carrying RC Cola on tap. This place is middle of the road Mexican and you'll feel a little bloated after you eat there, but still pretty good overall."}
{"text":"Looking for Mexican food and came across this place. I had two beef tacos, rice, and beans. The taco meet had amazing flavor. Very tasty. Salsa was good, but the strawberry margarita was ~$8 and not worth it. The place is cute inside and the staff was great. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"This is an old Mexican restaurant in old town area of Scottsdale (they also have one up at 101 and FLW). Really good Mexican food and a unique atmosphere downtown. Their sopaipillas are dynamite for dessert as well.  If you're up by the one on 101 / FLW it's rarely busy which has always been odd.  I guess not being a chain with a chain's advertising budget people simply don't know much about them. Their food is far far better than any chain however."}
{"text":"If you want \"ok\" food, minimal service, and a  bar full of kids than here's the place for you to go. Also, if you have any issue's you would like resoled know that even if the manager say's they call you back regarding the issue they won't. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Los Olivos was recommended by a local and we couldn't have been happier with this restaurant. Located very close to the Civic Centre, and near Old Town  it is easily accessible, even by foot from Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. Here are some comments:  Good: excellent authentic Mexican food, very reasonable prices, generous-sized portions, friendly service, parking lot in the back, lots of street parking  So-so: the place could use a coat of paint, but the food makes everything better  The chips here come with 2 bottles of different flavoured salsa which is a nice touch. I especially enjoyed the flautas and guacamole.  This is a highly recommended restaurant that offers excellent real Mexican nosh at reasonable prices. We'll be back next time we're in town.  A shout out to our server Daniel for great service!"}
{"text":"The guide recommended we get here \"before they get packed\" but was not impressed with the food or presentation. However, I loved the salsa ... It was like gazpacho soup."}
{"text":"I came here once before about 2 years ago and had the cheese enchiladas and thought it was good. I just recently came here and realized that this restaurant is not very authentic Mexican food but is targeted to the more Caucasian crowd. I don't mean any offense but, the food is not spicy, even though they say it is. The tacos had very little meat and te cheese enchiladas were a lot of cheese, and the tamales had no flavor.  The prices for the meal are not outrageous but not consistent with what you order.   As for the staff they are not very friendly and come off as if they don't care what the customer thinks. We were served by a guy of the name Moreno (that's what the ticket says and I'm not sure because he didn't have a name tag.) he never checked to see how our food was and hardly walked around to other tables to see how they were doing. He took more time trying to get a black folder to give our ticket and walking around us with our ticket rather than givin it to is directly. As for the bus/water boy was doing an amazing job clearing tables and all the duties that Moreno couldn't do.   I almost forgot about the cheese crisp. It was very greasy but oddly the tortilla was hard and cardboard like. It was gross."}
{"text":"A little wait, a little slow, a little greasy, was just OK. Tough to do lunch here and get back to work on time."}
{"text":"The fact that I found myself here while on vacation was not the fault of Yelpers. I was away from my computer and could not access reviews, instead trusting the bartender at the Phoenician on his word alone when he said Los Olivos would be a must. So, off we went!  After getting what could quite possibly have been the worst customer service from a couple of 16 year old girls my fiance thought \"psh, weren't even Mexican\", I later sat munching on my mediocre tacos with my head down and my ego bruised.  Did the bartender hate us?  Was this a joke that they play on unsuspecting tourists?  Maybe he grew up in some form of religious cult in Maine that didn't allow him to have Mexican food EVER, and now he ESCAPED to Scottsdale where he found a safe hiding place, discovered Los Olivos, and has made it his mission to inspire all of us to eat the #5 as much as possible.  I didn't get sick, but my heart...my heart...it hurts."}
{"text":"Unlike several other reviewers here, I found the service here to be lacking.  The prices and quality of the food sadly aren't any better.  Upon arrival you may be greeted with a lengthy wait (approx 45 minutes or so for me).  When you finally get your table be prepared to wait for at least another 5-10 minutes for a server to come and get your drink order.  The first bowl of chips is free but each consecutive one will cost you (a nice $2.50 at the time of this review).  Order what you like but substitutions will also cost you.  Sadly this historic \"landmark\" in Scottsdale has deteriorated into another tourist attraction that serves up overpriced bland, and mediocre at best food."}
{"text":"I've been eating here once a month for a few years now.  Recently went in and I think they changed the chef.  The food was sooo salty.  Way over salted.  I know what it usually tastes like, so this was a bit of a surprise.  The beef in my burrito tasted like ocean water...plus.  I'll give them another try but they need to get a grip on this or I wont be back."}
{"text":"In my opinion you don't get better Mexican food than Los Olivos.  It is fun to get the Old Town Scottsdale feel and it really has a pretty outdoor area.  A little bit of a sketchy part of town, but the food is definitely worth it.   The wait staff can sometimes be cranky, and the restaurant a little dirty but it is wonderful authentic Mexican food.  The Tamales and Enchiladas are out of this world.  One down side is that they start charging you for chips after basket number 2, which is a disappointment but the food is still worth it to me.   Decently priced too. I would definitely recommend anyone who loves authentic Mexican food to go here."}
{"text":"After being a loyal customer for the last 10 years, I'm now incredibly disappointed to give this review. Today I ordered a Pollo a la Queso Crema which is my favorite. Unfortunately, there was a paper towel or something of the sort baked into the Crema. Everyone makes mistakes but the way the manager, Ruby, handled the situation is why I will not be returning. Instead of apologizing, she told me they don't have that type of paper towel in the kitchen and started pondering what it could be. I told her I wasn't interested in what it was as it clearly wasn't food. She snapped back that I would be getting a credit. After five more minutes waiting at the counter, she finally returned to tell me their internet was down and she could fax me a receipt. I told her I would prefer a cash refund. She agreed but then took my credit card and wrote my confidential credit card info on a piece of paper asking me to sign it saying I wouldn't stop the payment. I told her I was not going to leave my confidential information just lying around on a piece of paper. She was incredibly annoyed and put a line through the numbers and again asked me to sign. I again told her she could not keep my confidential info so she scribbled out the numbers more. I finally gave up and took my money. I will never go back even though it was a childhood favorite. Buyer beware! Hopefully you don't also get a paper towel chimichanga!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a two-steps-up-from-a-hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant with delicious food, go to Los Olivos.  The food was DELICIOUS!!!  The atmosphere is great because it's very low key and exactly what it should be for what it is.  Yummy carne asada or floutas or enchiladas.  Very yummy!!!"}
{"text":"It was the worst Food I've ever had, to hard to chew on the burrito but it was even worse cut through the burrito.   I only had 2 bites and they still charge me for the burrito when I told him it was awful.  And way too expensive for what you get.  service sucks too no greeting or a f****** a smile"}
{"text":"Excellent chips and salsa/hot sauce. Food is great here. A local favorite since the 1950's."}
{"text":"Gazpacho Heaven  I remember reading the ingredients for gazpacho for the first time many years ago and thinking how it should taste. Unfortunately, it never had. Until now, at Los Olivos. It arrives with chunks of tomatoes, cucumber, and onion, slivers of cilantro, all swimming in a cool but not teeth-chattering liquid that is salted and oiled to perfection. If it were just the gazpacho I would give this place a 5.  In short the service was competent but not stellar, the smoky grilled chicken quesadilla was large and well filled with cheese with light smoky flavor. The tacos et al. were OK. The decor is dated and very casual.  The three real stand-out items were the guacamole dip, the gazpacho soup, and the chunky salsa that comes with chips at the beginning of the meal."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Arizona! Best service.. owners are very nice! We took a party of 40 over the weekend and the servers handled it flawlessly!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. Menu has lots of options- entrees, combos, and a la carte. Salsas, guac, and chips are great. Service was prompt and friendly, and restaurant itself has an authentic ambience."}
{"text":"Ate here after a baseball game because of proximity to the park and it was open late. Those are the only good things about this restaurant. The place was filthy - trash on the floor and dirty dishes stacked in the bar (on the customer's side!). Then our table faced a filthy storage area. Our server brought just one of our plates of food out which was incorrect. A few minutes later my partner's plate was brought out but then mine needed to be corrected. Then we had to wait even longer to eat together. Food was below average. Margaritas were all premixed."}
{"text":"I've been going there since the mid-60's! Went to school with Al Corral (RIP), have never been disappointed! Learned what a great green chili burro enchilada style was all about. Authentic. I live a couple hours away now but always visit when I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"FAJITAS FAJITAS FAJITAS! Really yummy fajitas here with a excellent appearance. They have REAL fruit margaritas here and are just delicious! CHIMIS are also good to go and dnt forget the tacos......"}
{"text":"We wanted to head to old Town to enjoy Mexican food on the patio. The patio is AWFUL!  The food is basic canned beans and standard rice and overpriced. The service was terrible. NO reason to seek this place out"}
{"text":"Great food and prices.  Servings are generous and the atmosphere is good.  A nice place for traditional Mexican in Old Town.  Really liked the Pollo Relleno."}
{"text":"We had not been to Los Olivos in a long time. It used to be one of our favorite Mexican restaurants. The food seems to not be the same quality it used to be. We have now gone twice recently and had a poor experience both times. We had our son's birthday dinner here and out of 8 entrees ordered everyone was in agreement that the food was below average. The best part of our dinner was the cheese crisp. Unfortunately, we probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here on the recommendation of our hotel desk agent and we were very pleased! We had tacos, tostadas, and enchiladas, and of course, a beer and margarita! Everything was authentic, fresh, and nailed the Mexican craving we were having. We are visiting from out of town but we have already planned to stop here when we return to Scottsdale next year. The layout and decor are so unique and charming. It was a great experience, and the staff was so gracious!"}
{"text":"The salsa and the fact it's a neat old building (on the outside) is the only reason it gets 2 stars. Tamales' were drenched in a red sauce and tortilla soup was luke warm and mediocre at best. Chips were cold and hard not warm and crispy. Overpriced for the quality of meal. Real disappointment when there's better Mexican food in Indianapolis!"}
{"text":"The food here is typical mexican food and good, but nothing I would rave about. Nothing to complain about either. I really come here for the great location and unique building. My daughter loves sitting by the fish tank and I always seem to find a new place to get a great picture of her every time I visit. There really are quite a few very good spots for taking pictures. Service is good and this place reminds me of what Mexican places were like when I was a kid which is not a bad thing:) I'm looking forward to sitting at the little bar or in the open air lounge and having a margarita one day when I make the trip kid free."}
{"text":"My wife & I are Scottsdale residents so we've had Mexican food a few ( hundred) times....this was an UNPLEASANT experience.  We had the Carne Asada & Beef Fajitas.   Her Med Rare was charred done.  My fajitas were a salty, oily pile of onions & peppers.   To top it off we gave our Groupon to our waitress & the fun really began....Claudia wrote the voucher # down & tried to redeem it but there was bad reception and it would not show as \"Used\".  We offered to go outside & try to connect... No luck... Groupon server was down. We went back in and Claudia told us we would have to call Groupon and she couldn't honor the voucher.  We asked to speak to a manager and she was very pleasant and explained that it happened to them three times this evening and as long as the waitress already had the voucher # it would be no problem. The picture is of our unbussed table after we paid our check and went through this 15 minutes of hassle!  Claudia needs additional CUSTOMER SERVICE training!"}
{"text":"The food was horrible. Taco Bell is more authentic than this place. The staff was rude and slow."}
{"text":"This place is only open bc people who don't want to wait 45 min to eat at The Mission but still want Mexican come here.  The chips were stale. Really stale. Their salsa and molè were delicious but would have tasted better had they served fresh tortilla chips. My husband ordered a pop, but it was flat. He requested another one and, it came from the bar this time, so it was okay. Apparently, their pop machine is broken but they're still using it.  The food was decent but nothing to write home about. I always ask the server to give me his/her favorite thing on the menu. She recommended the combination platter. The service was better than the food. For a place in Scottsdale and especially in a touristy area like Old Town, it's disappointing. I've gotten better Mexican food at the Julioberto's down the street from my house.   This place is tired and needs lots of improvement. I don't expect to be back any time soon."}
{"text":"We went here because my in-laws have fond memories of it, and have been going for years.  They still rave about it which I don't get.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve quest blanco--Los Olivos only has the yellow queso which the server even said is \"just Velveeta.\"  If you expect salsa in a bowl, or to have any bowls for it think again.  You get a plate for salsa, and the chips are stale.  I had the Mexican pizza which was cold, greasy and average.  We ordered a cheese quesadilla for my 2 year old and it came out on a pizza dish--it was huge greasy and the tortilla part was crusty and hard.  While I respect my family's fond memories I will not go back if I can help it."}
{"text":"I'm a little confused by the low ratings. If you're from Scottsdale, heck, if you're from Arizona, Sonoran Mexican food is what we know. This place is a staple.  You don't like a lot of cheese? Go to a Mexican-fusion place that's popping up with organic micro greens.  This is the real deal. There is lard, there is calories, there is FLAVOR.   Why 4 instead of 5 stars? This place hasn't been renovated in years, not a bad thing, but it's truly showing it's wear."}
{"text":"Three of us had lunch on 3/2/17.  Ate on the patio since we had our dog with us. Very pleasant with umbrellas for shade. Salsa is delicious. We had a beef chimi, chili releno, and taco with beef enchilada. We thought everything was great. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the noise factor. Music was a little loud and delivery trucks coming and going."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here, also has great comfortable atmosphere!  Was just visiting the area and Los Olivos was suggested as an authentic family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been in the valley for decades and remember when the food used to be good here. Tonight the food was overpriced and bland. I added salsa for flavor and that didn't even help. Bland!"}
{"text":"We travel from Northern CA to Scottsdale every year and we always make sure to dine here at least once per trip.  The food is reasonably priced, especially for Scottsdale, and the service is always great.  We have had Miguel as both our bartender and our server  and he is fantastic, although, all of the staff is great.  Highly recommend Los Olivos!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, atmosphere, and margaritas... ruined by horrific lighting.. awful/bright fluorescent lighting!  Too bad..., such an easy change would make the ambience so much better!  Glad the place has not been updated!  Love the authentic feel.. there's already too many 'new' places in Scottsdale, we don't need another.  Hated the salsa served in a carafe to pour on a plate!  Who thought that would be enjoyable?!!  A Mexican restaurant with only three margaritas on the menu?  Where's the silver coin?  Loved the food and great service!!"}
{"text":"Just got back from a birthday party at Olivos. Very disappointed with basically everything. I was in a large group, but if you're a waiter, you should be used to it. The service was lacking, it took us about 10-15 mins to get the chips, with no drink orders taken yet. Then a couple minutes later our waitress came by to get our drinks.  When a waiter came by with the drinks, I could barely hear what he was saying and I didn't even get what I ordered. He had no idea what half the drinks actually were and didn't care. The food was greasy and bland, I ordered the Mexican Flag. I didn't eat even half of it. I had finished my drink pretty fast, and it was on the edge of the table for the whole time we were there and no one refilled it, good thing I had a water. The best thing was the chips, and on a plus the atmosphere was nice. Overall I would not waste my time or money (a little pricey) ever again."}
{"text":"Los Olivos Mexican Patio is located in Old Town and is a cute older building with a delightful patio. Quite quaint and cute. We have been going there for a number of years and have always had good food and service. I recommend this place if you're looking for quaint and good."}
{"text":"I can't understand why this place is listed as 3 stars. Except for the fact it's set amongst snobby, inauthentic \"Mexican\" restaurants - it's in the heart of old down Scottdale. The best Mexican restaurant for miles hands down!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one. I want to like this place but....   It is definitely local and been around for forever. You almost wouldn't know it is there. It is kind of tucked back in a corner off a side street but easy enough to find. I like the inside decor. Different rooms almost with different themes. One almost looks like you are kind of underwater. I was meeting other friends here who were already inside so I wandered in. I told the hostess I was meeting people and was told that I could go and find them. Sure it would have been nice to have been lead to the table but most of the time they just seem to be walking with you anyway so that could be points off or not. Easily found my friends and sat down. Water and menus were already on the table and we were still waiting for a few more. Looking over the drinks I see they have Modelo Especial on tap it would be better if it was Negro Modelo but that will do. Waitress came over after a few minutes and took my drink order. It came out pretty quick and in the mean time I was looking over the menu and the rest of the party showed up. When asked the waitress said she couldn't do separate checks but could split them up at the end. That was ok. I finally decided on the Machaca after asking my friends who had been here before what they recommended. I had never had it before. While we were waiting it was chips and salsa time. They were ok. Nothing really great. Salsa wasn't really that hot. I know it was way under powered for my friends who like very spicy salsa though. The food came out after not too long. It came in waves. I will say that my water was never empty and dirty plates were not around very long. Here is where it gets tough because after everything being so so the food was really good. Nice flavor on the beef and homemade tortillas were very good. Overall it was a very good meal. Not disappointed at all. Now this isn't my new favorite place and it wasn't some of the best Mexican food I have had in the Valley but it was good. Good enough that I would like to go back and try it again with a smaller group and see how the experience is then. They could even earn another star.  One tip: From second hand information, having not experienced it myself, I'm told go to the bathroom here at your own risk. It is pretty bad. That is just what I have heard."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times in the years we lived in AZ and we used to really like it.  BUT...  What happened?  The prices went through the roof!!  A two taco meal with rice and beans for $10.???  Burritos were $13.???  This is Mexican food folks and in an old dive building...where are the profits going?  On this visit (after the Barrett Jackson auto auction so we were starved) we ordered some basics.  The queso ($6. wow) was almost solid...more like cut a slice out of it.  The Tacos had very little meat (can you stuff more lettuce in that shell?).  The rice and beans were find, but nothing great.  There are too many great Mexican food joints in AZ...don't waste your money on this one anymore.  WAY TOO EXPENSIVE"}
{"text":"My son had the fish tacos and the fish was delicious. The cabbage was bitter because it was from the part of the cabbage that you are not supposed to use - near the core. The rice was mushy, however the beans were okay. I had the chicken burro enchilada style and the chicken was boiled and dry. The enchilada sauce was bland and my rice was also mushy. The service was very slow. It took 30 minutes to get our food and there were only 5 other tables with customers. The chips and salsa were tasty and while waiting for our food I squeezed lime juice over the chips and added a little salt - that was tasty."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant often back 12 years ago. Then once I got a cold cheese enchilada back around 2004. I decided to give this place a huge break. It was 7 years total! I ate here on August 5, 2011 for lunch with a friend. The place has not changed except for they did remodel the bathrooms. The bar and entire restaurant is still the same. I had a green chile tamale and tried a cheese enchilada again. My enchilada was very hot inside not cold and the green corn tamale was pretty good as well. The reason why I gave them only 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because the staff is not friendly at all. It was almost like they were bothered that they had to work. If the staff was friendly and not bordering rude they would of earned 4 stars."}
{"text":"I went to dinner here on 10/28/2010. What attracted me was the reputation the restaurant had for it's authentic food and the Mariachi Trio music on Thursday night.  What a disappointment it was!  The steak fajitas came out and they were served as a pile of mostly onions and some green peppers.  There was hardly any steak in the pile and what I did find had very little seasoning and was tough, definitely not top sirloin! We were also served chips and salsa  which were OK, nothing special. Since we were still hungry after eating the fajitas, we ordered sopapillas. They came out and again what a disappointment! Hardly any flavor to them and very little sugar coating on the outside. The honey syrup didn't come in a serving decanter but instead in cheap peel open packages you would find at a fast food restaurant. As I looked around i thought the only people that would eat here are tourists(who will never come back) and people who don't know what authentic mexican food tastes like."}
{"text":"Definitely a favorite place for our crew every Tuesday for $2.00 Tacos, happy hour Appetizers  and the best Margaritas in town! Miguel and Shaun always treat us like family. SEE YOU NEXT WEEK!"}
{"text":"Los Olivos patio is a Scottsdale tradition. My personal favorite is a plate of machaca, and chips...maybe a side of rice too. The cilantro based salsa and hot sauce compliment the machaca wonderfully. It varies typically from being very good to excellent, rarely mediocre. That and an iced tea and I am in hog heaven. It just doesn't get much better than this IMHO. The tacos are quite good too!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Wonderful service (they even let us watch the NCAA game on the stage big screen on a Saturday afternoon), and amazing food. the vegetarian chimichanga is perfect -- lots of buttery cauliflower, broccoli, onions and mushrooms, not too heavy on the frying and smothered in melted rich cheddar. Top that with their pico de gallo and salsa from individual carafes on the table, and sour cream and it's just the best.   Also the atmosphere is fun, not stuffy in the least, and the ceiling opens on nice days, giving a feeling of being outside somewhere friendly and tropical. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Authentic, family friendly!  Food was good, reasonably priced. Very unusual building."}
{"text":"This place was incredible. We had a group of 12 at 7:30 on a Friday or Saturday (I can't remember) and they found a place for us immediately. My friends were obnoxious and we still didn't get kicked out! Love this place :) muchos gracious"}
{"text":"Margaritas were so so. My burrito was in a very doughy tortilla that was inedible. Guacamole was good. Everything else was just average. Would not recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"This is a local favorite and we always take our friends here. There is ample space and the food is authentic. This has a local favorite and has been for a long time.  Don't forget to pet the burro.  I recommend asking for recommendations.  Enchiladas are usually made consistently well."}
{"text":"Three stars is about right.  Its okay but not memorable.  The atmosphere was fun though and lively."}
{"text":"Great place to have Mexican Cuisine and very friendly service located in Old Town Scottsdale a great spot to visit if you're ever in Arizona you want be disappointed"}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of a local...   Good typical Mexican food.   Not exceptional but not bad.    The house Marg was good for $6 but again not something that I will remember.  The chips and salsa were fresh and good.   I didn't like the little carafes the salsa came in, had to pour on a saucer and try to get it on the chips.   Ended up asking for a spoon.   Get lil bowls for gosh sakes.     Don't try to be cute, it's good stuff, don't make us chase it around a saucer.   Nice dinner but I'll keep Exploring Old Scottsdale for the exceptional Mexicali spot."}
{"text":"Food had no flavor at all, chile relleno was all breading and no actual chili or cheese to found. Margarita was in a tiny glass and tasted like margarita pre mix and no tequila. Served ketchup packets for kids meal. $80 for crappy overpriced food and drink"}
{"text":"Other then the chips and salsa (5 stars for salsa) the food is good, but not so much that I go out of my way to eat there. The fajitas are delish, with mushrooms and the meat always tender, but the price makes me cringe. At over $20 there are so many other places I rather eat. I usually opt for a cheese crisp with green onions and green chilies and a side of guacamole (which is always yummy but pricey) and I still pay for all that $15 plus what ever we are drinking.... I love the overly rustic atmosphere, but it really could use some updating and maybe a good scrub.... Some of the servers are not the friendliest, but these are mostly the family that work there and have been there forever, so don't take it personally.... But overall it is a Scottsdale landmark that is fun to bring out of towers to and the food is overall good."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years, and I like the food.  Good Authentic Sonoran style Mexican food - BUT it is a little greasy and heavy, and I did see a dead cockroach under one of the tables a few months ago when we went in for lunch.  God knows why, but we have still been back there several times since!"}
{"text":"service was so slow but the food is good!  i like how they serve the salsa so you can pour it on your plate and add some hot in there!  the chips and salsa are good which is an absolute must in a mexican joint.  the manager kept flirting with our table and it was somewhat bothersome because we were all starving, not very talkative, and the service was so slow- please buddy just bring out our food!  i ordered the mexican chicken pizza.  it comes with pickles, i prefer guacamole as the green on the mexican pizza but overall, i liked it.  i would go back with hopes the service wasn't as slow and the manager wasn't as perverted.  Yah!"}
{"text":"Overall, it was alright. The margaritas were good, but they didn't taste like there was any alcohol. I had the Mexican Flag for dinner, but it wasn't anything special. Wouldn't recommend it as a \"great\" restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great place!  I've been recommending it for years, and just love it everytime i go there! They have amazing salsa, the environment is great, the servers are always nice, and just an all around great place for some good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"We love this place... sit in the bar with very friendly people; the chips and salsa are great and so is everything else~!!"}
{"text":"Fairly terrible experience.  We are avid Mexican food fans but this place is horribly overpriced, mediocre food.  On the bright side, the chips and salsa were pretty good.  The service was also fairly good."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. With the exception of the guacamole, everything we had was bland and tasteless - from the sampler to the fish tacos to the relleno, the consistency of which was disgusting and soggy."}
{"text":"Consistently Great Food! We eat here every time we are in Scottsdale! Met the great great Granddaughter of the original family that still owns the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new restaurant to go to when I came across  Los Olivos reviews. I have eaten here many times over the years and I will admit that a few times I didn't absolutely love my meal but these people who give out one star and two star reviews like they are God Almighty just makes me sick.  Los Olivos serves authentic Sonoran/Arizonan Mexican Food and does a great job at it. I love this place. Yelpers please remember especially if you are reviewing a small business that there are real people you are reviewing. Lets change the culture of Yelp by remembering what our mothers told us a long time ago. If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all."}
{"text":"Absolutely. Horrible. These are the best words I have to explain my experience here. Before coming in, my sister and I reviewed the menu and were extremely excited to come in as everything sounded amazing. Upon arrival, we were seated and given chips and salsa which were absolutely delicious. We really had high hopes at this point. We had a few questions about the menu regarding a simple substitution of carne asada for the steak that was apart of the tacos al carbon. Her response was \"oh that is carne asada, al carbon means steak\". wrong. She thought she could fool me. After looking over the menu more I noticed a chicken taco plate also called \"al carbon\". After doing a quick google search I was informed that al carbon meant \"over charcoal\" NOT steak. How dare she lie to me like that?? Regardless I ordered the steak tacos and they were not good. After picking at our disappointing meal, our waitress took about 20 minutes to bring us our check after seeing us sitting around waiting. After finally bringing the check she proceeded to wait at our table to pick up our money. Considering we are from out of town, we were excited to try something new in Scottsdale but we were let down. Will NOT be coming back. Thank you."}
{"text":"Lady giving salsa rude. Queso dip gross. Chips way too salty. Rice bland. Tortilla soup bland. Overall bad experience although our waiter was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"los olivos is what traditional mexican food is all about ! You wont find  any tex-mex BS here! The homemade flour tortillas are absolutely delicious , the choices of salsas and fresh chips that come to your table right when you sit down are  just  a sample of all the homemade goodness los olivos has to offer! And yes the food  is cheesy , fried , spicy  and maybe even a tad bit greasy  but if  you wanna say to hell with calorie counting  and carb cutting  for a day and experience mexican food the way it should be , this is definately worth trying out!  Oh and the shredded beef tacos? Delicious!"}
{"text":"Enchilada soup. Sounds weird, right? Well, that's exactly what I ate when I ordered a spinach enchilada. The sauce was so overwhelming I almost forgot I was eating an enchilada. The rice and beans on the side were fine, however. I actually really liked the rice. The others I ate with had food that was pretty mediocre. But, I just can't get over the fact that I had an enchilada that really was just weird soupy stuff. The service was pretty dissappointing, too. As vegans eating out, we don't expect everyone to bend over backwards for our diet, but asking to get some tacos and burritos without meat and literally just being told \"nope\" is a little ridiculous. From the outside, it looked like an awesome, authentic restaurant, but the service and my meal really brought that down. It's a gorgeous building, though, so check it out if you love bad service and enchilada soup."}
{"text":"From what I remember, I really liked Los Olivos. Now while the food did not leave much of an impression (I'm pretty sure I had some sort of enchillada plate), the atmosphere and the pitchers of margaritas were tops. Their chips and salsa were also fresh and delicious, making this a nice alternative in Old Town before heading over to the Camelview for a  movie when you just aren't in the mood for Orange Table or anything else around there. The interior is a classically Spanish style down to the burnt sepia clay tiles to the dark, cool Mission-style decor. A nice place to just wander in for some drinks, snacks, and to mellow out a bit on hot summer afternoons. Parking is free and did I mention pitchers of margaritas? They make them stiff folks!"}
{"text":"It's sad to me.  Los Olivos has been around for so long and used to be very good.  Vegetarian fajitas = 0 stars,  Chips = 3 stars,  Salsa = 4.5 stars,  Margarita = 1 star,  Service = 2 stars.   I only took a few bites of my vegetarian fajitas.  They were way over cooked and the flavor was off as if not fresh.  The tortillas they give to wrap up the fajitas were too thin and damp to use effectively.  I told the server I don't eat dairy yet they put a large glop of cheese on top of my beans.  I can't recommend the margaritas since it's obvious they use a powdered mix that's any not good.  It's about quantity and not quality."}
{"text":"Lunch at Los Olivos in Scottsdale. Ordered Carne Asada special - waitress asked how I would like my steak prepared and I asked for med to med well. The steak was presented well done and resembled something closer to dry jerky; flavor ok but was a very dry steak. Good thing I had a glass of water or would not be able to swallow steak. This special came with side salad; ok but I don't like iceberg lettuce. Also had side of rice and refrained beans; both staples for Mexican food and very good! Disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful!  Authentic and old school.  I loved it.  The interior does leave something to be desired.  I wouldn't say it's particularly romantic or charming, just a no frills restaurant.  But the food and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken enchilada; chips are tasty. Authentic, old world style restaurant."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to come here for lunch since we were all craving Mexican food. I was told it was one of the older places in the hood, so the atmosphere would be more authentic.  I definitely agree that it's more of the classic style Mexican restaurants - big layout, Spanish style tiles, decorations, and a very old fragile burro statue out front. The prices weren't bad, and food was pretty good too! The waiter was also a tall drink of water, which is always a nice perk ;) The salsa was especially good and homemade, yum!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food! Probably the best I've had in a while. The shredded beef tacos were amazing and everything was very fresh. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the service was slow, however it was pretty busy for the lunch hour. Overall I would definitely come back again when I'm in Arizona next time!"}
{"text":"Good.service. Friendly people. Margaritas tasted great. Had the carne asada and it was delicious. However, I asked for blue cheese on my salad and got ranch. Also, my wife ordered a shrimp chimichonga and it came with cheddar cheese. Some kind of white cheese worud have been better."}
{"text":"When you come out of this restaurant saying the the chips and sauce was the best part of dinner... That should give you idea that the food isn't good. Their is nothing authentic about the \"Mexican\" food they offer. I'm from the Bay Area and this was a disappointment and over priced. Tacos are $4-$6. The service is okay and be aware that the burritos are only filled with meat. If you enjoy Mexican food please save your money and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the world.  I LOVE their chips and salsa.  No one has a hot sauce like theirs.  They also use the best cheese and the cheese crisps are a must.  Consistently good food at a reasonable price.  We had a waitress named Alana and she was EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"This is literally my fav place for good ole American mexican.. coming from LA this hits home every time!!! Love love love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give this 2.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because today is a good day. :)  The service was a bit off. We had to wave down our server every time we needed something, even though she was always standing nearby. However, the food came quickly (including chips and salsa) and my water glass was refilled often.   The food itself was...ok? Good-ish? Odd? But probably mainly because of what I ordered.  First, the chips were thin and crispy and they bring you two types of salsa. I enjoyed the pico/chunky one a lot. The only thing that annoyed me is that the salsa comes in small carafes and you pour them onto a small plate.  I personally think chasing salsa around a plate is stupid and would much prefer a bowl.  I was trying to be reasonably healthy and ordered the Pollo Asado, which states it's a grilled chicken breast marinated in a mustard sauce. It's definitely marinated in a mustard sauce! It was good, just kind of weird in general and especially for a mexican restaurant. The refried beans and rice were absolutely outstanding though, and the tortillas are homemade. The meal also comes with a house salad that was drenched in ranch, but otherwise fresh and a side of \"pico de gallo\" which was warm and had green chili in it (didn't like that).  I also had their house margarita which had the signature bright yellow green color of a cheap mix, but was decently strong and on sale for happy hour.   All in all, not a bad experience, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"I totally LOVE this place.  It's been here longer than I've been on the planet and it's just super good."}
{"text":"I feel like Los Olivos has the potential to be a really great restaurant, but because it's located in the touristy old town Scottsdale the authenticity of the food is lost somewhat. Don't get me wrong though. It's not bad, but I've had better Mexican food up here in Northern Cali.   If I had to grade the food, I'd give it a C+. Just about average. In my opinion, the food was missing some salt and a little spice. Because this restaurant gets a lot of tourists, I think they toned down the flavors. I guess they figure it's better to be under spiced than over. They've got a great variety of chicken, seafood, and beef dishes. Combination plates make it easy to try a couple different menu items. I had a combo plate with two chicken enchiladas. It was okay.  The rice was decent. It had a predominate onion flavor to it, which I found a little off putting after awhile. Their chips were great. Thin, crispy, and sprinkled with just enough salt.   For a weekday night, it was jam packed. It was pretty loud and difficult to have a conversation. Service didn't suffer because of the crowd. My table was attended to promptly and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. Everything was on the pricey side. Not outrageous, but I was still a little surprised when we got the bill.  If a lived in the area I might (a very weak might) try Los Olivos again."}
{"text":"Best place in all of Scottsdale Arizona for authentic Mexican food! Service was great, servers were polite and friendly. My husband and I drove in from California we were in town for a seminar and tried different Mexican food restaurants and by far this was the best. I highly recommended Los Olivos! The shredded beef enchiladas plate was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this hidden out of the way gem yesterday with my family. Wasn't sure about it but omg!  I'm so glad we stopped in!  I had a chicken enchilada and beef taco combo plate and it was fantastic!  I've been missing real tacos and real Mexican food since I moved to Phoenix from Santa Fe and finally found it!    We also got the queso dip and quacamole. Both were fresh and clearly made with fresh ingredients.   The salsas were also fresh and really good however, I wish the \"hot\" was much hotter. I asked about that and apparently the reason you can't get hot salsa in the Phoenix valley is because the locals don't like it. Anyway. Both salsas had a great flavor. I could have just eaten the chips (also fresh) salsa guacamole and queso and been satisfied. But nooooo!  I had to go and order a meal!  Man!  I was stuffed.   Even the ice tea was good!    Our server, Toni, was a sheer joy and she made our visit even more pleasant!  She's a very positive person and an asset to the establishment.   My only wish is that I could have had a sopapilla and honey to finish. But I was stuffed anyway. So...    \"Family owned since 1947\". Here's hoping they're around another 70 years!!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome! This place is reason enough to travel to Arizona. I went for lunch and was blown away by the guacamole and beef chimichanga. Definitely not to be missed if you are staying in or around Scottsdale or Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I toyed with three stars and decided on four.   The cons: chips were a little greasy; salsa was served in mini-carafes (why make it difficult to enjoy the salsa?); decor is a little kitschy, as others have observed.  The pluses: gazpacho was fresh and good; food was fresh and well-prepared; lots of veggies; frijoles charros were delicious; service was good.  I wanted Mexican food for my night in Scottsdale, and I got it at Los Olivos. I went back to my hotel full and satisfied. Not overwhelmed or surprised, but happy."}
{"text":"Salsa is always good the hot & the mild. I wanted the machaca with an egg in a chimichanga rather then in a burrito, they did it and it was so good! Can't remember when I had a chimi (or anything fried) and this met my expectations and then some. Looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"1.5 Stars  I don't understand why this place has good reviews.  I usually trust YELP but this place was horrible.  The food was very blan and overcooked.  I had a tamale and chili relleno combo with rice and beans.  There was no texture to the food and everything had the same taste.  I would head to Frank and Lupes for some decent Mexican food.  I will not be going back to Los Olivos."}
{"text":"Unbelievably terrible service,  and extremely overpriced meals!  Most of our food was uneaten,  no concern from the staff (if we ever seen them!)   My son's meal was served with a plate so hot it burnt my fingers (no warning of corse).   Extreme tourist trap that could care less about you returning as a satisfied customer.  Don't waste your time or money in this place!"}
{"text":"It's really surprising that in this Southwestern town the best reviewed Mexican restaurant on yelp was so entirely a non-event. The enchiladas came smothered in cheese (good!) but the red sauce they were gooped in was so oily I couldn't stomach even one out of two. And the oiliness didn't stop there. Even the \"authentic\" Spanish rice was practically deep fried in oil. Though it's true you can actually taste the tomatoes in the rice which is the truly authentic way to make this dish, the amount of oil in it made it slip right off my fork each time. Oh, and the salsas that everyone else seemed to like came in two varieties, 1. sweet and chunky but completely devoid of cilantro or onions and 2. pureed with a hint of spice, still no cilantro and not worthy of being called \"hot\" like the waiter did when he set it down on the table.   It's too bad this place didn't live up to the reviews because the building and atmosphere were definitely unique and sets you up to have a good time. One positive I can say is that their blue agave margaritas went down smooth and tasty!"}
{"text":"While visiting AZ for work I had the chance to meet up with one my oldest friends.  So glad I got to have dinner with her because otherwise the dinner would have been a bust.    When I'm in Arizona, I always assume I'm in luck with Mexican food.  With this visit to AZ, I think I had better Mexican style food at my hotel than here!    My friend boasted about how they have the same old lady making the tortillas from when the restaurant opened so many years ago.  That's cool, I guess.  The tortillas were ok, so were the tortilla chips.  The rest of the food was a big, fat meh.  I ordered the steak tacos --- the steak was over cooked and dry.  The dishes was very Americanized; the tacos were served with cabbage (?), is that normal?  My friends' dishes were swimming in cheese.  The guacamole appetizer was good, so I guess that earns a star.  Listen, I'm no mexican food aficionado...I live in Michigan for heaven-sakes.  But we do have a small, but good Mexicantown in Detroit.  I've tried the food there many a times, and sadly Olivos pales in comparison to the joints in Michigan.  Honestly, this wasn't my favorite place I went to on this visit to AZ.  Thankfully, the evening was saved because I was hanging out with a friend --- otherwise I think I may cried in to my guacamole with disappointment."}
{"text":"Food fair and bland. House frozen margarita mix was bad. Some pre made crap they bought at Smart and Final. I was told this was the place. I can tell you, this is not the place. Sorry."}
{"text":"A little kitschy, a little run down, but the food was delicious!  The menu is massive. You could bring anyone here and they'd find something to eat that they are into. I had a veggie burrito, boring I know. My neighbors had fajitas and everything smelled wonderufl. I admit I had a little order envy.   We had a huge group, about 20 people and they handled us with ease. Service was cordial and quick. I thought it was a leeeeeeetle weird that they use table salt for the rim of the margaritas."}
{"text":"I was immediately turned off when I pulled up in the parking lot which is located behind this restaurant. .it looks like they haven't sprayed down the sidewalk since the day they opened. The Sidewalk is dirty and all black and you can smell the garbage dumpster just around the corner. .so I went inside anyways and couldn't believe how expensive their dishes are.  I settled for a LA cart bean and cheese burrito.  It was disappointing.  They didn't heat up my burrito all the way. .the beans inside were barely warm.  Food overall was mediocre.  Free chips and salsa nothing to brag about.  Service was good. I definitely won't be coming back here.  They haven't justified their high prices to me especially with the nasty appearance on the outside of this place. This is an embarrassment to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Uggh!  It's so hard to only give Los Olivos three stars.  I want to give them four really bad but as many other reviews indicate, their food is completely, utterly average and the margaritas that I've had are more like a freez-e-pop on the rocks than a strong, south of the border cocktail.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the guy to go to when you're curious if a drink is strong - it takes a lot for me to make a face and ask for more mixer.  That being said, on our dangerous and exciting skateboard margarita tour, Chris R and I asked the camarero to pour some more tequila in there.  He begrudgingly obliged, but that just brought it to a normal margo level.  I've had the fajitas which were good, and the chicken enchiladas which were amazingly average - at least for the prices which are dangerously similar to a certain competing restaurant 1.5 miles south on Scottsdale Road.  Los Olivos could win me over.  The staff is so warm and accommodating and I really like the old school, 'break from Fox Restaurant Concepts' atmosphere.  I'd say give it a shot - this is one of the most bitterly divided set of reviews I've seen!"}
{"text":"This is it!  Our family has been dining here for 51 years!  Bringing 4 generations to dine together and it is the go to place when family comes home for a visit!  EVERYTHING on the menu is top notch!  Our top faves are the Cheese Crisp, Sour Cream Beef Enchalada and Fajitas which is enough for two. Family owned and operated, and truly a hometown eatery.  Service is great, fast and the quality is perfect everytime-for the 51 years we've been dining here- we have never had a bad meal. The prices are great and quanities are good, and the quality is beyond compare. You will be back- again and again."}
{"text":"Fast service with a heavy pour in the mararitas. The food was okay, we tried the fahitas, carne asada, and fish tacos.   Music on the patio bumps my review to 4 stars.  (I feel like Ed McMahon saying that). A good place off the tourist laden places on Scottsdale road in old town.  Tip - when the server says the salsa is hot, take his/her word for it."}
{"text":"Took in some Los Olivos after a ballgame at Scottsdale Stadium.  We were referred there as \"the best Mexican around.\" I sure hope not.  It actually wasn't bad - but hardly the best. The chicken in the taco was a little plain, and the enchilada sauce was \"meh.\" The server was sweet, but didn't get my order straight (ordered a beef enchi, but got a chicken one).  Extra points for cool decor, excellent margaritas and a bomb fried ice cream dessert. 3.25 stars."}
{"text":"Agree with Meridith H.......just like to add they have unbelievable margaritas too!"}
{"text":"This place was great once upon a time. Don't even waste your time. The building is old and the bathrooms are disgusting and falling apart. The service is very bad. The food is better than most mediocre Mexican restaurants but not worth the hassle. Food finally arrived after 52 min wait.  Get it together Los Olivos!"}
{"text":"Have been coming to this family owned Old Scottsdale favorite with my son during our annual spring training pilgrimage for many years and it has never disappointed.   Start with a house margarita before happy hour close at 7.  It is not your average house marg as it is extra strong with a nice bite and not too sweet.  Love the unique adobe atmosphere; built by the family generations ago; interior with sky lights and tanks full of tropical fish, lots of room inside which extends out doors.  Crowded bar, but good service.  Chips are thin, crispy and served warm with a choice of salsa.  Preferred the hot, spicy version.  My son had the generous portion of beef fajitas and I enjoyed ala cart green chili tamales and grilled fish tacos."}
{"text":"When you walk up to the bizarre entrance you are not sure if this is a good idea or not. But knowing that this is a family run restauant for years is somehow comforting. With a prime location on the corner off 2nd, next to the Scottsdale Performing Arts Center, you can't go wrong.  Now, I have to be honest, I only had one thing to eat and drink. So my review is limited. I had the rolled tacos with sour cream and guac. It was okay. They were very generous with the guac. Service was with a smile. The drink was strong but good. You can tell they want you to have a good time.  Problem: the place needs a lot of TLC. There was exposed plaster on the wall in the \"Aztec God\" room by the exit door. There were nice paintings on the wall and then random beer advertisments on the wall. The floor uneven and the 'used to be stage' was a open storage area. Then a tv and boom box exposed in the room as if set in your personal living room.  All in all, try it because it looks fun. But then just check it off your list."}
{"text":"When we come to Arizona, we always expect good Mexican food - and this place did not disappoint. The chips and salsa are delicious - the salsa is very fresh. We ordered the guacamole to start, and it was tasty but massive. Sadly we could not even finish the whole thing it was so big! I had the fajitas and they were decent quality and very tasty. I also tried the chicken enchilada and that was good. Someone else ordered the machaca and seemed to enjoy it. The service wasn't the most prompt though, but there was a live band which made for a festive atmosphere, and the margaritas were excellent."}
{"text":"Los Olivos has obviously stopped trying. The food was below average, even by gloppy Mexican food standards.  Our party of 12 was served efficiently and with warmth by the staff. Lovely people. But most of the food is just ok. Everyone liked the cheese crisps, which were on very thin, crispy tortillas. The beef burrito was beef and a tortilla -- nothing else; very bland. I had the fish taco. Rubios is far better. Combo plates are in the $12-15 range, which I think is robbery for food this average. If you're craving 70s Mexican food, with soupy refried beans, gobs of cheese, this might be your place."}
{"text":"Yes, they are great at Happy Hour, with their margaritas and taco plates and endless chips and salsa, but I also came in for dinner with a friend, and they were super friendly, prompt, and in my favorite setting for Mexican food in the Valley. Yes, it's about a mile from my house, so love the Civic Center location as well. I trust a place that's been operating continuously for like, 65 years, as well (unheard of nowadays!). Fantastic ambiance, service, and food--thanks, Los Olivos!"}
{"text":"I do like this place they actually make the tortillas and chips there and they dont use hydrogenated oils.  They use milk in the refried beans instead of oil.  The one at North is very trippy it has glowing magenta mushrooms on the walls. Very acidy, weird.  I liked the cream cheese burrito thing but I got it not deep fried.   Pretty good a bit pricey but the portions are huge so share.  It truley is family owned my brother is friends with the owners son. I think 2 or three families own it.   It is the best mexican food I have had soo far.  But still not amazing"}
{"text":"Good food  Great ambience, cool drinks Good site to be with friends!!! Buena comida y buenos Tragos buen sitio para estar con amigos!!!"}
{"text":"Los Olivos has been around for as long as I can remember and I have been their many times in the past but it has been awhile... I am guessing somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 years!  so I guess today was my day!  We had a team lunch to introduce a new team member to everyone and this was the chosen destination.  Let me just say that if you have a large party of 10 or more and want the lunch experience to be handled efficiently this is your place!  Our waitress was so efficient!  We never waited for anything... our drink order was taken promptly and soon after our order was taken our food came right out!  Being that we had 14 people in the party I was pretty impressed.  Lastly to make things more challenging for our waitress everyone was paying their own bill (argh!) it could have been overwhelming.  The chips and salsa were very good for my lunch entree I chose the Mexican pizza with ground beef.  I enjoyed the Mexican pizza except for the ground beef part... they just dumped ground beef on top of the pizza... I thought it would be part of the pizza.  Anyway I would say we had a good experience at Los Olivos... high five to the wait staff!"}
{"text":"Los Olivos is a quiet resturaunt in the Old Scottsdale city near the SF Giants spring training site. That is how I happened on this wonderful family style eatery. Arrived to the area to meet a Good HS friend and was way early. Used the Yelp app on my phone and soon I was here! Seated with out any wait. The place was just picking up since the ball game was not to far off and it was Dinner time as well. Service was very efficient and pleasant. I'm partial to Chicken what ever in these Mexican style resturaunts, and had a 'Chimi'. Arrived shortly and enjoyed it emencely. I would recomend Los Olivos to anyone. Looks as if they can handle most any size group as well! Everything is reasonably priced as well. Enjoy! Holla!"}
{"text":"Lunch here last week was great!  The server was very attentive, the chips were light and warm, the guacamole was delicious, and all four of us totally enjoyed our lunch!  I've been there once before & really enjoyed it, so when friends said \"Mexican\" I suggested Los Olivos.  I did think that the tamale was a little too \"thick\" but it was still very tasty. Two of us had margaritas and they were very good too!  I see someone posted a negative on the bathrooms but I went to the ladies room and it was immaculate."}
{"text":"They're slipping something fierce.  One of their best dishes is the fish taco, which I got just over a week ago.  Yesterday however the fish came out extra stinky (old fish), and they tried to cover it up by making it super salty.  Now I have to find a new Mexican sit down restaurant.  :/"}
{"text":"I know I give more four star reviews of establishments than I probably should, and I'm trying to break myself of the habit, but Los Olivos deserves a solid four stars in my book.  Like others have said, the food isn't over-the-top amazing, but its solid Mexican and its solid consistent.  I've had enchiladas (fantastic), fajitas (fantastic), and multiple times, the guacamole (fantastic).    What is over-the-top is the architecture, the character, and the somewhat-rustic feel to the slightly-wacky dining room(s).  While it is not completely clear from the exterior of the Los Olivos structure, the interior reveals a Xanadu of sorts, no ceiling angle alike, no wall length perpendicular to another.  Floor tiles show signs of decades of foot traffic, and chairs reveal evidence of many meals enjoyed.  In a town where most establishments are half the age of your favorite pair of jeans, I find the comfort of Los Olivos to put me at ease.  On the weekends make sure to arrive early, or you will be asked to wait for what could be more than an hour, and its not a comfortable place to sit and have a drink while waiting, so plan accordingly.  If you like Mariachi music, give them a call ahead of time and find out when the strumming goes down.  My last time there the band set up within arms length of our table, and while some might have found this to be annoyingly distracting, my party used it as a great excuse to kill the small talk and let the guitars, vocal chords, and flavours do the talking...  Los Olivos = Love the Place.  Mexican Food = I would marry it if I could."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Los Olivos in over 10 years and after this last visit, I was wondering why not!?!  I was on a food tour of Old Town Scottsdale and this was one of our five stops.  We were served chips and salsa and a taco with rice and beans...so amazingly good and just the right portion size for our food tour.  This restaurant has so many unique dining spaces and I highly encourage checking out the entire place during your visit...you'll be impressed!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through grubhub from this place and I'm glad I did! It was fast, the guy was very nice, and the food was AWESOME! I got the mini sampler so I could try the beef tacos, chimis, and flautas. They were delicious and it came with a very generous side of the best guacamole I've ever had. They also gave me a big bag of chips and two different sides of really tasty salsas. I look forward to dining in and trying some more of their food."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Home style Mexican. Their chicken quesadilla was amazing and I loved their home made hard taco shell. It wasn't busy when we went in the afternoon on a Sunday, but I can imagine this place would be buzzing at night. Great family history."}
{"text":"I know better than to eat here, it was great back in the day, but now the 3rd generation is running the place.  And I'm sure there hasn't been any upkeep since then, the place is dirty, run down, staff is rude.    I had the carne asada dinner last nite, and within 10 mins of leaving I was sick.  That's it for me, I won't be back.    BTW, don't go in the bathrooms, they were really dirty."}
{"text":"Not sure where all the 3+ star reviews are coming from on this one.   Tired Mexican place in Scottsdale, with very mediocre food.  We had a cheese crisp with chicken and a mexican salad.   Both were bland and you could easily make better Mexican food at home!  it was also weird that they serve their salsa in carafes and you have to pour it on a plate and try to scoop it up with their stale chips.   Have you ever heard of bowls people??"}
{"text":"I went for a baby shower and they served appetizers.  Everything was very good. The guac was nice and fresh with not too much onion.  We also had good service that kept our iced teas filled."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that to get 1 star from me is hard.  I will give anyone a chance (or 2, off nights happen to the best of us), but I have never been so disappointed  in Mexican food as I was last night.  And this was not the first time I've been to Los Olivos.  We were regulars for a very long time (even organizing office Christmas parties there), but the quality of the food, the taste of the food, the service and the employees dedication has taken a severe nose dive over the last few years.  But having not been in about 2 years I stupidly thought I would give it another chance with the hopes that changes in staff and time would have made the experience better.  For a restaurant THAT close to a spring training facility, they should be striving to be the best and attract the clientele that will come back year after year. Word of mouth is key in Scottsdale to keeping a business going.  You can have a flashy restaurant, fancy chef, but if the food and service sucks, no one will go.  I have been here MANY times over the years and last night was THE most dreadful.  To start with the guy taking names at the front was totally disinterested in being there.  I spelled my name for him and he still spelled it wrong.  When I corrected him he ignored me.  I spelled it again and he gave me a blank stare and said kind of half-assed \"sorry\", but didn't change it and continued his riveting conversation with the bus boy that he must have felt I  interrupted.   We were seated in the back room by the patio and ignored for 10 minutes (no menus, no drinks).  Our waitress was obviously slammed because we saw her running back and forth the whole time covering the inside and the patio and another dining room.  The noise level was the loudest it has ever been.  The salsa was all tomato water and no substance.  The \"fresh lime margarita\" had almost no tequila and the strongest taste of bottled lime juice ever.  The food was awful.  We ordered a cheese crisp and my daughter took one bite and said it was gross.  I tried it and she was right.  The oil coming off the cheese was immense and the tortilla was burnt.  I brushed off the bad cheese crisp, thinking (hoping) it was just an off night, but when I got my Steak Picado, the beans and rice were the worst I've ever had.  The rice was dry, tasteless and clumped together.  The beans were crusty and had no flavor.  But they did have a huge puddle of oil forming on the top.  The steak was fine, but after having tried the rice and beans my stomach hurt and I couldn't eat.    My husband ordered the Mexican pizza and he had the same puddle of oil on his.  He asked for no tomatoes and it was covered in tomatoes.  The meat was fine, but again the tortilla was burnt.  The friend we brought with us barely touched her burrito.  We were all unsatisfied.  I was even more upset when I got a $60+ bill after telling the waitress we were unhappy.  I will never go back.  I was willing to give them another chance last night, but there are way better restaurants to choose from and spend less money at for really good food."}
{"text":"This place is a classic, it used to be one of my regular places, good food, decent service, been around a long time, good vibe here. I sent in last month and they had new menus - they at least DOUBLED the prices on the menu. 20.00 bucks for a taco plate, no thanks! one of the nice things about mexican food is that it is affordable. Not here!  this place just lost my long term business."}
{"text":"I was semi-dreading coming here recently since I already wasn't a fan of Los Olivos, but it was my friend's birthday and you know how that goes.  We had a reservation for ten people and the table wasn't ready for about thirty minutes.  Not ideal.    We decided to pass the time by having a drink in the bar area.  My red sangria tasted like wine and cranberry juice and didn't have any of the lovely fruit chunks I was hoping for, just a single maraschino cherry.  It was kind of pathetic.  Once we finally got our table, things started looking up.  The chips and salsa weren't bad.  However, even the milder of the salsas was a bit too hot for some people at the table.  Before heading over to the restaurant that night, I'd consulted Yelp just to see if there was something redeeming that I'd missed on my previous visit to Los Olivos.  Holly R. mentioned getting the Mini Combo every time and it sounded interesting so I decided to try it.   This little combo really does have it all - mini taco, enchilada, tamale, rice, and beans, along with a boatload of cheese.  Thankfully I was able to get the green corn tamale instead of pork.    Others at the table seemed please with their selections.  Still, there are definitely better Mexican places around.  The service was a bit slow and I found the atmosphere dark and depressing."}
{"text":"Five words - pollo a la queso crema!    It's a chix chimichanga topped with jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar cheese on top of that.  If you like a little spice in your life, this is the dish for you. The creaminess of the melty cream cheese, along with the crunch of the chimi is to die for.   The chips and salsa are my fav in AZ, crispy thin chips and a great trick someone taught me was to mix the hot and mild salsas together.   The family that owns it is always friendly and Veronica, the bartender, mixes up some the best drinks in town, including my fav a michelada (beer, lime juice and I hold the clamato).  This is always a MUST DO when I come home to Scottsdale.  I'm a huge fan of both locations and it's great for groups.  I've also ordered their app platters for parties, which is always a big hit."}
{"text":"This place is so cute inside and out. However,  the food is horrid. We all felt terrible once we were done eating. My fish tacos were the worst I have ever had. They were so fishy tasting, I couldn't even finish them. 2 other people in my group had the same problem. The queso was pretty much Velveeta."}
{"text":"Nice Bartender, Cold Modelo Negro on Tap. Good Chips and Salsa Lunch Enchilada and Tamale w/Rice & Beans combo was great and pretty cheap. Funky interior. Whats not to like."}
{"text":"These folks are resting on their laurels. Or....perhaps I am spoiled by so many good Mexican food restaurants in West Texas. Nothing seemed that fresh or tasty. Spouse Dale says he liked his tortilla soup but could only choke down one of his mini-tacos. My combo plate had a taco with carbonized (literally) beef-like strands, no discernible enchilada and a dry litttle tamale. Yep, we're spoiled. OK magaritas."}
{"text":"I had one dinner here a few months back and I enjoyed it. The service was great and the food was pretty good. It's not the best I've had and it wasn't mind-blowing, but it was still good, and I plan to go again soon. If I remember correctly I had the chicken enchiladas, (a benchmark I use for mexican/southwest restaurants). I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Fun place.  Because it's just typical Mexican food, I can't bump it up beyond 3 stars."}
{"text":"Have you ever been excited to go to a restaurant because it's your first time going to it? Like you've expected way too much only to be let down. The booze was pretty good, but the food was pretty lackluster. With the exception exception of the fish tacos of course.  A restaurant this caliber has the potential for kicking butt, but doesn't because of fear from losing their regular clientelle. The old tired out menu, prolly old tired out cook, plus the old tired out bar strongly indicates that this place never ever changed since they opened up decades ago. Judging by the people that eat here, you can definitely bet that they'll tell you straight up, they've been coming here since God knows when.  Hopefully they'll turn this spot around. There's a revolution going on guys. Don't forget that for every one person that doesn't like change, there's 10 others that actually do. Target the hipsters, they're the new generation with the expendable income.  I probably won't be back to dine here any time soon. Maybe if I see from other yelpers post pics of a menu change and new food then I'd reconsider. Other than that, I'll be taking the good hike out to Jalisco Taqueria instead."}
{"text":"Overly-stuffed chicken tacos, served with rice & beans; cheese quesadilla; chips & salsa. What's not to love about this place? Que rico!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The burritos and nachos are fantastic. Great service and delicious food. Worth stopping in and trying the burritos! The chips and salsa are also a huge plus!!"}
{"text":"WOW! We just happened to walk into this restaurant for lunch and it was SO SO good!! I got both the shredded beef and pork tacos and it was so flavorful! My friend had the tostadas and loved hers too! Don't skip the sopapilla dessert it was amazing too! I just about licked my plate and if I'm ever in Phoenix again this will be on my \"must go\" list!"}
{"text":". Don't waste your time or money!!! I wouldn't go back if the food was free. Bad service and even worse food! Only the cheese crisp is worth trying. Salsa was bad, chimichanga was horrible, beans were slop, rice was dry and crunchy. Nobody in our group enjoyed the experience. Couldn't even get a refill of water, and they were not very busy. Should have know. No wait and plenty of open tables normally m and no repeat customers. Not real sure how they stay in business...."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and we were seated as soon as walking in. The food was really good, very authentic in my opinion. The food service was fast and friendly. The establishment itself is pretty old and not the cleanest I've seen (dust in the window seals and so forth).  I will go again. The staff was friendly and quick to answer any questions or offer information on the menu items."}
{"text":"Our hotel (Holiday Inn Express) recommended this place for dinner.  It's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to and beats anything in the DC area.  The chips are home-made and delicious.  The Cadillac margarita is tasty and strong.  Our meals were great:  enchiladas, chile rellenos, a la carte beans.  Nothing not to like.  I'm surprised by some of the bad reviews, but it shows me that the Yelp score is not always accurate."}
{"text":"Another recommendation for me from the hospital staff at Scottsdale HonorHealth... A little history of the restaurant: it was actually the house of the original owners built in 1919. The restaurant has been owned and operated by one family, although I'm not sure if there were still members working there... But if so, that's pretty cool to me.  Again, I was greeted with an expansive menu to choose from. They give you chips and salsa for you to wet your appetite as you debate what you're going to get. Both the mild and the hot salsa was pretty good, and the hot salsa definitely has a kick to it!   I ordered the Flautas Ana and was given a big plate of 3 Flautas topped with lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and avocado with a side of beans and rice. I also ordered a side of guac, which I didn't really need because of the avocado. This was learned after the fact.   I didn't eat dessert due to having my heart set on another place, but my friend got the French vanilla fried ice cream which was BOMB!! The French vanilla flavor coupled with the churro-style crusting made it super delicious!!   Definitely enjoyed the restaurant and what it had to offer. I would love to come here another time with my family."}
{"text":"Service here is unfriendly at best ( i sat in the bar)menu both lunch and regular boring .chips ok salsa served in a small caraf which makes it inconvienent  to get salsa to chip. food was ok some of the chicken in my taco was dry do to the 8 million degree oven they put it in before serving to you . this place is a true tourist/youngen scottsdale hipsters joint"}
{"text":"I love this place! My parents started taking me here as a little kid and now I always go back when I'm in town visiting. I love the interior, each room Is different and super cool. It feels very welcoming and traditional. The service has always been friendly as well. I love love love their salsas that they bring you for free. I try to always order a different meal and they've all been good so far! The chicken is always really fresh tasting. The margarita (fresh lime) is also very good. I will always come back!"}
{"text":"The food I ordered (Chicken Fajita) was nothing short of disgusting. What was really disturbing is the waitress actually originally gave me the wrong order & aggressively argued with me to accept the wrong food. Everyone else's food looked like it has just come from the nether region of a dumpster - if you're looking to eat, avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"We went here on a recommendation from the cashier at one of the store and we were pleasantly surprised!!    On a Monday night the place was packed!   That can't be a bad thing I thought, right?   I had a chili releno and it was one of the best I've ever had.     Every item our group ordered was great.   The beans and rice were perfect.    The salsa was very fresh and hot.   Little bit to much for me but I'm wimpy.    Prices are very reasonable.    Good portions for prices.  If you want good food I'd totally recommend going here.   If I'm back in Scottsdale I'm definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Tourist Trap if your here for spring training stay away.  Bad food, bad service, bad management/ ownership, decent venue and salsa.  Sold as authentic Mexican food but you probably get better authentic Mexican in a small town in Idaho or Vermont.  Not sure how this place became a \"staple\" in old town other then location but you should not go there.   The corner Fiesta Burrito by my house serves better food.  If you are looking for good Mexican there are about 20 within 5 min drive that are good with owners that care about quality not just taking your money.  If you want New Mexican Carlsbad Tavern on Hayden is great with a patio and copper bar, if you want street taco Mexican Cien Agave's is right down the street or Diego pops is on Scottsdale rd.  If you want traditional Mexican literally open google type in Mexican and anything you see is better.  Ok now to the experience, we came with a group of 20 or a going away party for a friend.  Service was very slow we ended up going to the bar to get most our drinks as it was about a 20-25 minute turn around.  They would not split checks.  When in the land of amazing mexican food its not hard to be adequate but they failed the food was dry with no body.  There was no zest it was so simple with no flavor.  Most the people there were long time AZ people and not Mexican food snobs but not one good thing was said about the food.  When it came time for the check as you can imagine it was nightmare 20 people eating and drinking and they wont split the check, not the end of the world just annoying in the 21st century. I would not have been as bad if they did not completely mess up and double bill everyone.  Now people have left and they said they accidentally cancelled the transaction so we needed to pay again.  not only that but we had to pick up the people who have already left.  The \"owner\" was outside with part of our party completely unwilling to help the process  turning this into an hour ordeal.  Guess what well they did not refund the first payment so we are all double charged now.  I call to talk to a manager tuesday she can only find the first transaction and says they never did a second not true i am looking at a closed (not pending) transaction on my account for $75.  yes you heard that right they have the one they say the cancelled but supposedly cant find the second one.  Anyway that's my experience with this place I would strongly suggest avoiding it."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with this review except to say that this is, hands down, the worst restaurant experience I have had since I moved to Scottsdale a year and a half ago.  A friend planned a post-work happy hour here with a large group of friends (7 total), with most of us arriving around 5:30PM. Before being seated, as we arrived a little early, my boyfriend and I found seats after the bar. After a short wait, the bartender came over and served us each a Corona, which was the only reason this place got a star at all.  Once our friends arrived, we were seated in a large booth with an adjoining table. Our waitress was kind, but ineffective at her job. Repeatedly, she walked away from our table mid-sentence or once we'd asked to order. Being new to Los Olivos, I decided to stick with a relatively safe entree: nachos with chicken. She asked me if I'd like to add guac and sour cream and when I said \"sure\", she informed me that each item was a THREE DOLLAR upcharge, and that the basic nachos (cheese, jalapenos) with chicken were $14.95, meaning the resultant nachos with guac were going to be almost $18!! When I saw a menu and realized that only cheese and jalapenos were on the nachos, I called her back over and asked to cancel the order altogether so that I could get something else. She said that they were already done and she would charge me $15.95 with the guac because \"some of the prices in the computer are wrong\". Okay, I ordered them, they're nachos, how bad can they be, right?  Wrong. Ten minutes after she told me that they were done, they came out with the rest of the food. The base chips were greasy and covered with what appeared to be dried up shredded cheese, melted 10-15 minutes ago. You couldn't even get a chip without it breaking off from the baked-on cheese. The chicken was dry, and had no moisture. Yes, the portion was large, but that doesn't matter when the food is inedible. I -never- send food back or refuse to eat it (seriously, I could probably count on one hand the number of times that's ever happened to me in my life) and I -LOVE- nachos... but these were terrible. The entire rest of the table shook their heads in apology, and even when I offered them up, no one else wanted any.  At the end of our meal, I approached the ticket counter to pay and told the young girl there \"Look... I ordered these, so I'll pay for them. But you need to know... those chicken nachos...\", then she finished my sentence \"Were terrible? Yeah, I know... They're bad! You should try something else next time!\" I said \"I'm just going to be honest, there's not going to be a next time here. This was really, really bad.\" She took my card and ran it (for $20, with the automatic gratuity) and told me to have a nice day. No apology, no offer to let me speak to the manager to at least make them aware of the food quality... just an acceptance that she KNEW they were awful and then swiping my card.  So, that's it for Los Olivos. They're my first one star review, and I have to tip my hat to them because they really earned it. The rest of our table all had reasonable experiences, but this was enough to turn me off of them for good. (Except their tiny $20 margarita pitchers... which the entire table thought was a rip off. $27, if you want strawberry.) Save yourself the trouble, go to Dos Gringos, Loco Patron, or any of the much better places with decent service to boot. At least they take decent care of their customers and will care about the experience."}
{"text":"My pregnant wife and I visited this restaurant on our last night in AZ. We wanted great authentic Mexican food. What I got for $70.00, would have equaled $8.00 at a local Taco Bell. Taco Bell is also better than this restaurant. Besides the guacamole, everything was as bland as could be. I'm not sure they even own spices. I hope Michael J Fox picks me up in his time machine so we could do this decision over again. Not only did the food suck for my wife and I, my unborn daughter was also disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here because my Mom likes it. The food is mediocre. The service this time was excellent. I had fish tacos that tasted like frozen old fish. The beef taco was bland. All the tacos were covered in grated cabbage and accompanied by day old pico-de-gallo with some weird creamy stuff on top. I have no idea what keeps this joint going, except that if you are drunk with margaritas, then probably anything tastes OK. Guys, the '70's restaurant model needs to be revamped...Either you play the \"retro\" food thing or you actually serve decent food. The chips were good, and the salsa was decent. Prices are too high.   With the proximity to Mexico and a healthy Mexican American population, this restaurant has no reason to serve this kind of food. Underwhelmed, for sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this restaurant. Typically, we split a meal because the portions are huge.   Favorite appetizer (and the ONLY one in my opinion): Mini Tacos.  My favorite dish: Carne Adovada (but I love this dish anywhere I go)   The food is pretty much standard, good Mexican food, but the Mini Tacos rock my world. Don't order them if you are trying to be health-conscious. You will immediately regret your decision.   Great for large parties, and they cater. SO YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch today and was geeted by the host promptly. Once sat our server was right there with a friendly deminer.   The place is pretty big and at 11:30 it was also empty. Lunch items were delivered fast and ice teas stayed full.  Starting with warm chips and 2 salsas was great although I would prefer the salsa in a bowl to dip the chips in.  Lunch included a lunch special taco plate and a chicken quesidilla and 2 ice teas for 29.75,  I thought that was a but high, but this is Old Town.  On a service note the sugar cadies on the table look like the haven't been cleaned in months."}
{"text":"Service from our trip was pretty bad in my opinion. We had the older lady but she seemed relatively unattentive to our needs. We said we were ready to order and she disappeared for a long time. We asked her to take a picture and she said her hand shakes too much and that she would send someone by... never happened. We had to ask for chip refills but the salsa didn't get refilled. I kind of think those go hand in hand...but maybe I'm just too demanding for a Mexican restaurant haha! My food in particular was disappointing. We work nearby so this is one of those nostalgic places that we always come to. I think $30 for a pitcher of watered down margarita is a ripoff. It is also relatively annoying to be looking for your server and seeing her eating while we are waiting for her. If you have a group of nine, it makes sense to clarify if the tab will be split right? Not hand us a $200 bill and expect us to figure it out with 9 credit cards and the bill not separated. I had to write names next to orders to get her to split it correctly. Needless to say, that took a ridiculous time to sort out.I get it, it is a mom & pops kind of a place..."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food here!  In fact, my group went here twice within 24 hours. Get their cheese crisp, it's a tortilla pie that has hot cheese on it. They have good margaritas and the food is greasy and good!"}
{"text":"The worst Mexican my girlfriend and I have ever had! Just thrown together. Couldn't find our enchilada in the mess of beans, rice and whatever. Greasy hard shell tacos, they sucked. And to top it all off.... EXPENSIVE!. Don't even bother wasting your time and money."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sit-down Mexican restaurant in town, review is based upon over 100 visits over the last 20 years. Classic food and atmosphere. Recommend the cheese crisps (green onions and peppers is my fav), combination platters and the Cadillac margarita. Staff is friendly, gets your order correct and always is willing to go the extra mile if something is out of sorts. Great cantina, but also the perfect place for los ninos. Great central location. Ample parking. In the Scottsdale scene where valet is almost mandatory, this is very welcome.  Fri/ Sat night or during Spring training I'd recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVED our meal, the service was incredible, they were very accommodating to our menu changes. This family knows how to make an impression!  Don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and take my family to it whenever they're in town.  The food is great, it's family owned and it's reasonably priced.  They're happy hour can't be beat (I think I paid $3 for house margaritas) and I love the salsa.  Great atmosphere and really laid back.  Always really packed during Giants games (Spring Training)."}
{"text":"My family stopped in here the other night.  I was excited to try somewhere new.  Service was really good, our waiter was such a nice guy and knew we hadn't been here so was helpful.  I like the ambiance and it is a convenient location.  That being said...the food was severely lacking.  The chips and salsa were decent but they only give you one free basket.  Everything we ordered was over priced and small servings.  I am used to going out for Mexican food and taking home leftovers but this night we didn't have any food left and we paid more than we usually do.  Not to mention the food is really lacking in flavor. My husband got the famous pollo asada con queso and he said it was one of the driest things he's ever eaten.  The inside was just chicken, very little sauce on top...he actually thought perhaps it had been prepared wrong.   I got the mini sampler which had better flavors but when they say mini they mean it,  it literally was a tamale cut into a third?!  About a quarter of an enchilada?!  So weird.  Each sample was literally 2 bites.  But with a full meal price.  Beans and rice didn't have tons of flavor. Kids meals are much smaller than usual and are a hefty $7.  This place is geared towards tourists.  Unfortunately we know of many other Mexican joints in the valley that serve better food for way better prices and won't be back here."}
{"text":"Don't list their drink prices. Food was mediocre at best probably closer to 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Los Olivos is a classic. It's been around forever and the food doesn't disappoint.  The taco shells are perfectly crunchy and my burrito was stuffed full of goodness.  If you're in the mood for some classic Mexican food - Los Olivos has you covered.  Plus, the chips and salsa are delicious and never-ending!"}
{"text":"Very, very good Mexican food.  The flavors were awesome.  The beef Tacos are soooo good and the mole sauce for the Enchilada was outstanding.  Probably the best Mexican food we've ever eaten.  Chips and Salsa were excellent too.  However, the service was something to be desired.  The hostess forgot about us at the bar so we had to follow up on being seated and our waitress was a cool and aloof and didn't follow up with tending our table very well.  The men waiters were on top of their game as we watched them tending others.  We had to call on the Bus Boy a couple of times to refresh our water glasses.  Would definitely go back for the food and hope for a different waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"I liked this place! It is in Old Town and beautiful architecture. Very unique and lots of cool places for pictures around.  Anyways we got sat right away and the service was great. It was our first time there, so they did great at offering recommendations.  Their chips and salsa is excellent!  I could have eaten that all night.  We got Sangrias as well which we just perfect!! Sometimes restaurants mess those up but these were great.  I tried a taco salad and loved it.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food.    So no complaints! Good authentic Mexican food for sure. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent !! We tried three different apps, margaritas & entree tacos.  Love it all. Highly recommend Los Olivos"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I have never had a bad dish. locally owned by the same family and you always feel like you are home.  I had the cheese enchiladas..."}
{"text":"This place, like Macayos or the Teepee, is practically a registered Valley historical monument so it gets the deferential kids glove treatment.  Kitschy but fun ambiance and home to some classic oldschool dishes like the Mary Lou and various enchiladas.  Be warned they are super liberal with sour cream."}
{"text":"From 30 minutes after we ate our Green Chicken Burrito, for 2 days -- major stomach issues. Not coolio. Not even close."}
{"text":"It had been a couple years since our last visit and was throughly disappointed in the food this time. I ordered the chicken tacos el carbon and all they tacos had in them was flavorless chicken and cabbage, I had to drown them in salsa to make them edible the beans and rice had the most flavor on the plate. My wife ordered the nachos and it was a giant pizza pan of meat, cheese, chips, and grease. For 15.00 I would have at least expected a little bit of beans and maybe some sour cream or guacamole on the side but nope that was all extra.   The best part of the food was the kids meals but you really can't screw up a bean burrito and mini chimis.  Although the food was bad the service was good and the staff that we encountered were very nice and great with our kids."}
{"text":"I truly appreciate the history and architecture of this place; the ambience and staff were pleasant. The chips and HOT salsa are delicious! I know this restaurant is well known for great food but I must have chosen poorly today. The fish tacos just were not very flavorful. They are cooked in butter rather than fried which is a bonus in my book...but that means any sauces must have extra depth and oomph to bring out the flavor of the fish. I will definitely return here and hopefully make a better choice next time."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious- can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Great atmosphere and superior service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food. Good as always.  But........yelp said 10% back. But the restaurant said that they don't  honor the 10%.. I don't understand the miscommunication."}
{"text":"I've been going to Los Olivos Patio since the dawn of time. This family has been in the neighborhood since the early 1960's. I've always enjoyed the Margaritas and the Quesedillas. The food is authentic and tastes as good as it reads on the menu. Anytime family members come into town for visits or vacations they always ask to go to Los Olivos. Enough said. This restaurant is amazing."}
{"text":"I don't know how long Los Olivos has been around, but by the looks of it, it seems like a pretty long time! Old Town doesn't have many old-style Mexican food restaurants with a classic atmosphere like Los Olivos. For this reason, Los Olivos gets four stores in my book.   Los Olivos reminds me of Mexican food restaurants I used to visit as a child. They have fiesta-themed decorations, plenty of decorated tile, an adobe mission style atmosphere and good food and drinks. Yes, there is better food in the Valley...much better in fact. However, Los Olivos is a good choice if you want to have a casual dinner in a festively-themed atmosphere that serve margaritas in pitchers!   For food, I eat the same type of Mexican food everywhere I go, and the same goes for Los Olivos. I like their guacamole, quesadillas, chile rellenaos and chicken burritos. As for the margaritas, they are classic margaritas that go down smoothly. Again, this restaurant gets the stars mostly for a festive atmosphere and decent cuisine and cocktails to accompany it."}
{"text":"I had the \"blue room\" all to myself for lunch on Saturday.  Nice and peaceful watching the  salt water fish being fed fish pellets.  No sharks just little fish chasing around and trying to eat quickly.  I wanted something light so ordered the chicken tostado ala carte with quacamole.  A pleasant surprise with large chunks of hot white chicken, chopped lettuce and just a few beans, tomato and cheese. on a crisp corn tortilla. The quac came on the side so I could add as necessary.  The tostada with a glass of Dos Equis came to $11.01 and that included a basket of chips and two sauces.  The tostado was a healthy alternative plus I didn't cave in for many chips."}
{"text":"My wife and I love the food here.  The place is old, a bit run down looking, and I guess that is another reason we like it so much.  It feels just so authentic.  We split the fajitas often, and I really like the tacos, cheese enchiladas, guacamole and nearly everything else we have had.  The cheese crisp with guacamole on the side is crazy good.  Nothing like great tortillas to make everything taste good."}
{"text":"I've been going to Los Olivos for years now and it's still one of my favorites. No matter what you get it's great! Service is great as well. There is a reason this restaurant has been opened as long as it has and attracts the crowds it does.   Great homemade mexican food, great drinks, and great location (both locations have great food and service).  Certainly worth a try if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Hands down best mexican restaurant in town! Great atmosphere and amazing food. Service could be better but what restaurants service is good? Relatively cheap. Last time there was 5 of us with multiple drinks with our meals and it only came out to $120. I'd recommend taking outbid towners here or a date."}
{"text":"How anyone can rate this resturant with just one of two or even three stars is insane!!! This is one of the best Mexican resturant's that I have ever been to, outside of Mexico! I'm from the Philly area, although we do have some choice Mexican resturants, they simply pare in comparisson tot his place. I discovered this resturant by accident really. I was searchign for a place to have lunch last year after a 90 minute tour of Frank Lloyd Wright's Talyesen West homestead, and accidently came across this amazing resturant. I enjoyed the place so much that I returned this month, as this was the next time  that I made it out to Phoenix. The aesthetics of the place are spot on, the food is exceptional, with a wide variety to select from o nthe extensive menu..and the most important attribute, the quality of the food, authentic tasting and looking fown tothe last taco bite!!! They even offer for $2.00 a 32 ounce of Dos Equis on tap!!!! Astounding!!! Viva Los Olivos!!!"}
{"text":"I think this is the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Order two enchiladas and you couldn't even see them on the plate. My plate looked like a big pile of slop. This is the first time I've ever been here and I've lived in Scottsdale over 20 years. I'm still trying to figure out how this place has even been in business that long. I'll surely never go there again. Absolutely horrid!"}
{"text":"My final trip to Los Olivos was months ago, and it was unbelievably bad. I sat at the bar with my boyfriend. We just ordered two Diet Cokes and a quesadilla. Easy, right?  Wrong. The bartender was ridiculous. I had to ask for refills, plates, and napkins. At one point he left his spot behind the bar for about ten minutes and came back reeking of weed. The quesadilla was a greasy mess of goo. Somehow lima beans made their way onto it. Whatever meat topped it was gristly and gross.  Save yourself the hassle. Just don't bother."}
{"text":"In the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, Los Olivos delivers Mexican food with an old style flair.  The decor is festive and the some of the waitstaff appear to have been working there forever.  First of all, they serve two distinct salsas.  I am not a fan of the enchilada type hot sauce, which is an Arizona thing, but the other salsa is fresh and full of onions, tomato and cilantro.  It tastes as though it is made right before it is brought to the table...so fresh.  We had to ask for a bowl for the salsa, which is apparently not normal at Los Olivos, but we were making a mess trying to use our little plates for the chips and salsa.   I ordered a combo plate and my husband ordered the enchiladas.  The flavor was delicious and much like Tex-Mex, which is my favorite.  The margaritas were also great.  The prices are reasonable and truly, this is the best Mexican food I have found in Arizona.  They offer fajita meat dishes, which is a rarity.    Los Olivos was packed at 6:30pm when we grabbed dinner and we quickly learned why.  It has been around for decades and has earned a reputation for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ventured to Los Olivos on a Wednesday evening after finding out about them on a happy hour app for my iphone. The happy hour specials looked good enough to try a new place in Scottsdale. Got my boyfriend to try it with me, seeing as we both have a deep love for Mexican food! When we got there we were seated promptly, and the place has a real authentic feel to it. I think it's family owned? Our waitress was not super friendly, and told me the only item on happy hour was the house margarita- no food on happy hour (so I was misinformed).   We decided to stay anyways and try it out. I had the house margarita for happy hour which ended up being $3.50 so not bad. Imagine the size of a wine glass, that's what the margarita came in basically. It tastes like an average house margarita. But no complaints, I had already figured it probably would. The chips and salsa were amazing! A chunky salsa and a hotter sauce as well; I wanted to eat the whole basket. We got a cheese crisp to start, and you can never go wrong with a cheese crisp! I ordered a shredded beef taco plate (2 beef tacos with rice and beans). The tacos were good, nothing extraordinary but I would get them again. The Spanish rice and refried beans were delicious and I was really happy with those.   Overall, the food was decent and the service was subpar. I like trying to support local and independently owned joints, but honestly for what I had I would probably just go back to macayos."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a spring training game for food. The only reason to stop in this place would be for the servers and a beer.  Salsa from a carafe? What a mess. I don't even want to know what type of beef that is in the tacos. It was grey mush. I will never be back. 2 stars is for the service."}
{"text":"The Good: - The entree tasted good. - The salsa was good.  The Bad: - Went on a weeknight, should have been no wait, but waited at least 5 minutes before someone even showed up to ask me how many people would be in my party. This is, of course, in addition to someone standing behind the counter and completely ignoring me until somebody else showed up. - Waited over 10 minutes to get drink orders. - The chips were stale. - The food was overpriced. - The drinks were extremely overpriced. - I got sick after eating there.  Overall, I'd look elsewhere if you want good Mexican food. Don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"I had purchased a Groupon before our trip to AZ.  We were not disappointed!  The food was authentic Mexican and delicious!!   We shared fajitas.  There was plenty of food for the 2 of us!  We shared sopapillas."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food at a reasonable price.  I had chicken enchiladas and they came with a ton of rice and beans.  Quick refills on the chips and salsa.  The service at the bar was good and I need to get back to this place more often when I'm in Old Town."}
{"text":"100% Mediocre  Atmosphere- Eh  Service- Eh Food- Eh  I wouldn't waste my time & tastebuds with this place again. I mean, it wasn't bad... But it wasn't good either!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this. I have heard about this restaurant nonstop for a year now from a co worker who raves about this place. Its not in my neighborhood but finally decided to try it out when I saw a groupon for it online. We made our way east yesterday with high expectations and an empty stomach.   First off, kind of strange location. Maybe its just me, we live downtown phx not old town Scottsdale. Its stuck between hospitals and out patient clinics, just off Scottsdale road. Parking is tight, you'll have to walk around the building to enter. The building is old, but beautiful in an old Spanish charm kind of way. Cute, fine we'll enter. Right when you walk in it states to wait to be seated. And that's exactly what we did. We waited....and waited some more. They were definitely not busy, from what I saw.   When we were finally seated, it was at an extremely small table against a wall. Figured I could make it work, it was me and a 5 year old. A gentleman brought us chips and salsa, and I saw something was a little odd. The salsa was brought out in these tall narrow pouring things that you cannot fit a chip in to dip. Once I looked around, I realized they did not provide bowls either, so here I was pouring salsa on an appetizer plate making a bigger mess than the kid was!  I had scanned the menu online prior to driving out there because im terribly picky and take too long to decide, causing my kindergartener to get irritated. I decided after previewing it that I would get Pollo a la Queso Crema ((a flour tortilla stuffed with chicken breast, deep fried and topped with seasoned cream cheese & melted cheeses, served with beans & rice)) Yes, that's directly copied and pasted from their menu.   Sounds good right. Well holy heck it better be for 15 BUCKS! My cheap self cringed at that amount (terrible I know). Good thing I had bought a groupon so it was discounted. The kiddo got the kids combo, a beef taco and enchilada, with rice and beans. I decided to try a blended house margarita, crossing my fingers it wasn't going to cost me $10 bucks, the liquor prices are conveniently never on the menus right!!!  The waitress was extremely prompt, and friendly...older lady. She was very pleasant. The food was good, and decent portion. Overall though, I would not come out of my way to eat here again, and definitely wouldn't pay menu price. If I came across another groupon for them, I suppose I would visit again. If you live in the area, and arnt as cheap as me, then yes I recommend it."}
{"text":"Los Olivos is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the valley. If you are truly Mexican or were fed by one than you know exactly what authentic Mexican tastes like. I know some people are used to that southwestern food some like to try and pass as Mexican so that is what their expected tastes are. If you think Chipotle is Mexican food than I would see why you would give a mediocre review for Los Olivos. Personally I think places like Chipotle are disgusting because of my taste for REAL Mexican but that's a whole other review. :)    I have always been treated well here and I have been going for years. My Tata (Grandfather) was a Mariachi player who's band played at this restaurant back when it opened so I love it when I see Mariachi there..it reminds me of him. The food tastes exactly how I expect it to taste.. DELICIOUS and just like homemade. The prices are very reasonable to me and the restaurant itself is cozy. Also, the Strawberry Margarita I had was so sweet and smooth I could have drank them like Kool-aid! :p  My favorites are their Tortilla Soup and Green Chicken Enchiladas but recently I think they changed cooks because the recipe for the Tortilla Soup isn't the same. No worries though because it's still good! I will always come back here. I would have gave them 5 stars but i'm afraid even though the food is good it's not as good as Comedor Guadalajara but Los Olivos is better in location and atmosphere. Both restaurants are the same in rating for me..just for different reasons."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in the Valley. Simple, authentic dishes prepared with ultra-fresh ingredients. The salsas are wonderful.   Another plus is the band in the dining room. Don't let the exterior put you off.  Plan for some time either before or after your meal to take in the local atmosphere of Old Town Scottsdale, all within walking distance."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 40 years, use to be be great , now it's just bad, no flavor carne asada, cheese enchiladas just a blob of melted cheese, flavorless sauce, parents are rolling in their graves, I would be too"}
{"text":"Great food, fast and friendly service, but a little pricey. I love tex-mex and I typically get a ground beef chimi plus chips & queso when I go to a new restaurant.  They were both spot on here. I asked for ground beef, but I go shredded however it was very tasty and super quick so I didn't care much. Chips & queso were $7.50 which seems a bit steep for cheese and more of the free chips. We added the table hot salsa and it was even more terrific and spicy.  The waitress was very nice although she did disappear for about 20 minutes when we needed refills and more chips.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful family restaurant!  Four generations of my family have loved Los Olivos for over 50 years."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant because we had a Groupon . The food was excellent . Waitress was attentive . Great kids menu . Family friendly . Would definitely return ."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with some friends, we were celebrating a friends presence , she had moved out of the valley almost 2 years ago, we were a party of 8.    This was my 1st time to Los Olivos and I was kind of excited to try them out. Unfortunately sometimes being me requires you to attend more than one party in a day, so I just came from another party where I had already filled up on some food, so I wasn't very hungry, but wanted to join my friends in the fun!  I was about ten minutes late, asked the hostess were my friends were seated at, and was told, oh just look around till you find them, we have a few parties here tonight.  I thought well isn't that nice I get to roam in a place I don't know very well. But turns out I didn't have to go far, I found them in the 2nd room.  I sat down, and was browsing the menu, our server came to me and said what are you drinking and looked a little perturbed that I joined this table. I just told her water. I wasn't the last one to the party, my other friend showed up 5 mins after me, and she got the same chilly attitude from the server. And with a big party like ours, it didn't really matter how bad the service was, because the tip was already added to our bill.   Everyone placed there order, I wound up ordering Deep Fried Ice Cream, since I was already a meal ahead of everyone. While waiting for our food, I was munching on the chips and salsa, now I'm not a fan of the salsas, the \"hotter\" one was way to seedy for me. I like hot salsa, but I don't like feeing like I'm eating sunflower seeds. And the mild salsa was like a pico de gallo minus any peppers and runny. I mixed the 2 together, and that didn't really help either, so eating chips and salsa wasn't working for me.  Now the deep fried ice cream that was perfect! The sweet taste of honey, the crispy outer shell and the cold ice cream made a perfect treat for this hot summer day!  I really wanted to like Los Olivos, maybe I'll go to the other location and give them another try."}
{"text":"Supposedly the oldest Mexican restaurant in the area, we were directed here by our concierge.  The place has a kitchy, almost 80's feel, but it needs some updating.   The menu is a bit too \"American\" for me; if you expect a truly authentic experience, this is not the place.  I think they get a lot of tourists here, who are used to the more Americanized dishes.    To start, the salsa is extremely tasty - very fresh - although the chips seemed \"bag\" quality.  After that, it was all downhill.  Two stars is a gift - it's closer to 1 star.  For lunch, we had the machaca - dry, shredded beef with peppers and tomatoes, and a combo plate of chile relleno and a corn tamale.  The plates look like a disaster when served; sauce everywhere, very disorganized.  The plates came out so hot they must have been microwaved - not a good sign at a respectable restaurant.  Too much sauce, also a sign of laziness and lack of attention to detail.  The rice was not great - not made fresh, and also crisp on top from the microwave (or taken from yesterday's rice pot).  The refried beans were a flavorless mash of canned beans; avoid.  The machaca shredded meat itself was somewhat flavorful, but again it appeared that they make it day(s) earlier and then re-heat it after slapping it on a plate.  Not authentic. The flour tortilla was huge and actually the best thing I tasted, other than the salsa.  Americanized, large plates of re-heated slop.  My advice - find a REAL Mexican restaurant, and stay away from this joint."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes yes yes. Cheese crips. Tamales. The salsa is flavorful and on point. Great service. Chips were hot and crunchy. Yes!!! Best place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I heart Los Olivos, and in ways that go over and beyond any other Mexican places I've ever been.  Using my strict algorithm for Mexican perfection of chips, salsa, red sauce and margarita, Los Olivos becomes the benchmark by which all other places are compared.  Love it.  CHIPS are crispy, warm and perfectly thin.  I salt them and go to town on the freshly prepared SALSA, an addictive blend of tomatoes and jalapenos mixed with their HOT SALSA of red chiles and scarcely a tomato.  The flavor is just divine, best washed down with a FRESH LIME MARGARITA and plenty of salt.  I could dine on just the following and call it a day, but if I have a group to share with (or a lion's appetite) I will indulge in a cheese crisp.  The tortilla is pliable and perfectly chewy, and the Mary Lou with green chile con carne comes with a toothsome topping of tender beef chunks braised in green chile sauce and topped with melted cheese.  So good!  Our usual favorites are the beef tamales, crispy chicken tacos, enchiladas of all kinds, the chimichangas (my husband eats the SHRIMP CHIMI every single time we go, without fail) and the sumptuously perfect machaca, served dry with the perfect blend of spices and goodness and a tortilla to boot.  Num num num.  The service can be slow and at times lackadaisical - on other nights, the waiters are attentive and blazingly fast.  Just depends who you get.  If you go on an off night for service, definitely don't give up because the food is so darn tasty.  Rather, go when you have time to kill, eat and drink heartily, and know that you are in for a treat of an evening.  Sidenote: Man peddling roses inside the restaurant is persistent - I'm still trying to figure out who he knows or how he's related to the owners in order to be allowed to interfere with the service in the place.  Your guess is as good as mine."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican food I have ever had.  It was bland and greasy.   Don't go."}
{"text":"Los Olivos is a decent place to stop for Mexican food. It has been around a very long time, and it shows its age. I find the eclectic decor to be kind of charming myself. Of course, the iconic burro is always there to greet you as you walk in.   The chips and salsa are good, but I haven't had much luck finding an entree I really love. I usually go for burritos, and they have all been serviceable. The chicken does tend to be very bland, but you can always add salsa. We have also always found the service to be very attentive.  If you get tired of slick, chain-style restaurants, Los Olivos is a nice change from them."}
{"text":"Los Olivos reminded me of a Mexican restaurant I went to when I was little.  Service was excellent, our waitress was super nice and joked with us.  Extra staff kept drinks full and offered more chips when he saw we were low.  Salsa was delicious, my Husband and 3 boys loved the HOT salsa and I stuck with the regular salsa.  Both kinds were delicious and tasted fresh.  Veggie fajitas were yummy, huge serving as well.  Chimichanga, fish tacos and a chicken dish as well as chips and queso were enjoyed by all.  Good rice and beans, yummy tortillas.  Margarita was okay - not the best, not the worst but I could definitely tell I drank a margarita!  Giving 4 stars because chips after the first two baskets were extra and it's already kind of pricey.  We had a Groupon so it wasn't painful.  We would probably go back if we visited Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Not good. My friends raved about this place but the food was incredibly bland. Even their \"spicy\" salsa lacked flavor and had no kick to it all. The concept of the indoor patio is cool, like Pattie's, but the restaurant looks old and run down."}
{"text":"Warning!  Be advised that this once upon a time popular restaurant has seen better days.  Now it's a shabby shadow of its former self.  The food is NOT good or even OK.  The tortillas are greasy and so thin and tasteless that I was amazed to see my fingers through them.  How can you ruin a tortilla?? My taco crumbled into an oily mess after one bite.   The beans taste old and starchy. The chicken is boiled to death in water without seasoning.  The cheese enchiladas were cold inside.  And the rice was overlooked. And bland.  However the salsa was tasty but for some reason served in small wine carafes.  We were told to \" pour the salsa on the chips as we ate them\". A new idea I guess.  The server was sweet and friendly yet oblivious to the atrocious quality of the food.  The owner was busy flirting with the help and although willing to exchange our plates for something else we were just anxious to leave as quickly as possible and locate some Tums.   Additionally parking next to the restaurant was a mistake because the horrific smell of old and putrid grease nearly destroyed our nasal passages.  It is a shamble of a place - both the structure and the food.  Be aware.    Just around the corner is a better choice-  the Mission Restaurant!!!  This is a quality establishment-"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to take visiting guests as the setting is great as is the downtown location, and the food is good. Not super authentic but better than most chains."}
{"text":"Horrible service at the bar ... I sat for 15 minutes with an empty beer... my food order was wrong and took 30 minutes for a lunch meal .. then as I left I politely told the manager about my experience and she said we hardly ever have anyone say they had a bad experience... are you sure that everything wasn't ok..... she then acted as if they don't need my business because they have been here 60 years..... not taking care of people is how we lose our old Mom and pop restaurants I guarantee the people that opened this restaurant would be disgusted!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was good... service friendly and very prompt.  Reminds me of La Pinata in the SF bay area..  Salsas were really good. They put the salsa in little bottles, so it's really really hard to eat it. And, a lot goes to waste because it's hard to scoop it off of a flat plate. That was kinda weird, but the flavors were spot on.  Started with a sampler plate- all chicken items= chimichanga, mini tacos, flautas... chicken meat was all white, and very fresh, and cooked really well. The guac on the plate was outstanding!  Really good flavors..especially when the salsa was added to the items.  Sis had chicken enchiladas, said they were outstanding. The enchilada sauce had a nice red pepper flavor. Not spicy at all- just a wonderful deep flavor.  I had a 3 item plate- beef taco, cheese enchilada and pork tamale. The tamale was soft and creamy and cooked perfectly. The taco was delicious- the beef was shredded and really tasty. The cheese enchilada was BIG! Not the normal skinny thing that you get at some places. Everything was fresh and really good.  I should have tried something else that my regulars. I'm not from the area- but if I'm ever back, I'd order the pollo ala crema... sounded great."}
{"text":"This place has amazing carne sada tacos. The salsa is exquisite and spicy! A little pricy for a Mexican joint but well worthy our money"}
{"text":"Some colleagues and I had lunch here recently.  Complimentary Chips & Salsa are served with your meal.  After browsing the menu, I went for the Cheese and Onion Enchiladas w/Rice & Beans.  The dish came out fast and on an extremely hot plate......be careful of these plates, you'll burn your hand if you touch them.  After letting the food simmer down, I went for a bite of the Enchiladas....they were really good!  I poured some of the Hot Sauce that came with the Chips & Salsa on top of the Enchiladas to give them a nice kick....yum!  The service here was really good and they were very friendly.  We had a great time.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Los Olivos is our go-to casual Mexican restaurant. The guacamole is similar to what I make at home, very simple (so delicious of course:). We also like the salsa, however they don't provide bowls for salsa, which really irks my boyfriend.   Most of the Queso dip is not great - it reminds me of (and may be) Velveeta (congeals quickly).  The have a Mariachi band Thursdays and Sundays. $3.00 carne asada and pork tacos Tuesdays, but only in the bar."}
{"text":"Every bad review about this restaurant can suck it! This is one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in Arizona and one of the BEST. The free salsas are great. The fish tacos are to die for. The beans and rice have amazing flavor and spice. All of the workers go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. It is not overpriced at all as you can see it's rated $$ 2 dollar marks. People need to learn to be less negative."}
{"text":"I love Los Olivos! The restaurant is huge with many different areas, but you should still be prepared to wait at peak times because this place is popular! All the food here is delicious - awesome margaritas and chips and salsas to start! The guacamole isn't quite spicy enough for me though. I usually order the shredded beef chimichanga or tacos! They are both amazing! I will say the prices here are a little higher than your typical Mexican restaurant, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I really like this place!!!  It's missing a star because the last time I was there- I got stale chips =(   and the fact that there's not enough meat in my food- I order a carne asada steak and only a tiny piece came. =(  Onto positive things!   I had my quarter century dinner here- I'm personally not a fan of Mexican food.  However! I really like Los Olivos becaue they make everything fantastico. There were about twenty of us there and everyone clean their plates and glass- pretty much all of their chimichangas were really good.  We kept ordering pitchers of the lime margaritas- I love it so much I'm tempted to change this to five stars.   The drinks kept flowing.  I really like carne asada so everytime I'm there, it's something meaty.  One time there was thres amigos performing for my party, Guantanameras!!! i love Latin music so it was very suitable and added to the good time we were already having.  Another time, there were latin dancing, and I was having a blast getting my Latin groove on before hitting the club. If you're a Latin entertainment lover, then come on a Friday or Saturday night, you will have such a great time at this place. I also like the architecture and the interior designs of the restaurant.  It's pretty awesome!  The manager also come out and party with my party and our server was so sweet!   I am thinking of having another birthday there! =D"}
{"text":"Food was served hot and beer was served in frosty mug what more do you want from a   Mexican Restaurant?  Steak Picado  was good chips n dips flavorful Enuff said !!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? This place is absolutely awful. We were there today before the giants exhibition game. All 6 of us thought our entrees were terrible. Sensing we were less than pleased the young waiter told us we should have asked him for his opinion before we ordered. Dude, if you have the key to the secret menu share it!    One guy in our party ordered the Caesar with chicken with the dressing on the side. It came out wrong and when by the time it was replaced the rest of us were long done with our entrees. Oh yeah. He threw a tip on the bill ( I assume because we were a party of 6). What a tool."}
{"text":"Although it is not my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley, Los Olivos is definitely my first choice for Mexican food in Old Town Scottsdale. The building itself has unique architecture (although it would be nice if they didn't need a sign that asks people not to climb on it) and according to the menu, a great deal of history. The location is also great, being in close proximity to Old Town Shopping and the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall. Further, the first time I went to Los Olivos, there was a mariachi band playing in the dining room.  What I am forgetting in this review... oh yes... food!  The meal starts with two varieties of salsa and a basket of warm tortilla chips. I was pleased to find that the hot salsa was actually hot. I've tried the enchiladas and the burro (which is definitely not a burrito) and while both were tasty, I didn't find either to be anything special. One thing that did stand out to me was the Mexican style rice served with both dishes. I can't think of any better way to describe it than to say they got it \"right\". I could go on about the number of franchised Mexican and southwestern restaurants I've been to that screw up this basic side.  The prices and portions are reasonable, although with a group of five, all wanting to pay with plastic, it was frustrating that they weren't willing to split the check (and there was a sign posted stating this)."}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" Mexican restaurant in the valley. I have been eating here for 25 years and in fact, I ate here my very first night in Arizona.   Chips and salsa are always out of this world good. Made fresh daily, they serve two types. Hot and hotter! The hot is a traditional chunky tomato salsa with onions, jalapeños, cilantro, etc. The hotter salsa is smooth red chili. Both delicious and really good mixed together.   I highly recommend getting a side of guacamole to enjoy with your chips and salsa. Hands down, best homemade guacamole you will ever eat. I don't know how they do it, but I have not had better anywhere.   Their food is great. I don't have a set favorite thing so I have tried just about everything on the menu. Today I had the carne asada and enchilada. Steak was very tender and flavorful. Outstanding! Another favorite of mine is the steak fajitas.   Combinations are also a hit and they have several to choose from.  They also have lunch specials Monday-Friday.   Fried ice cream? Don't miss it. Traditionally served, coated in cinnamon crunch and honey. Mmm!  My favorite server at Los Olivos is Toni. She is very sweet and is a fantastic server. I always ask for her when I go in. Not to worry though, all the other servers are great too.   Next time you need a Mexican food fix, try Los Olivos in Old Town Scottsdale and be sure to ask for Toni!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love their food!! Service is insanely quick and the margaritas are delicious! Perfect place for some authentic Mexican cuisine! Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Ttoday I am writing about Los Olivos Patio.  This is a place that I recommend to peeps when they want good mexican food and don't care about the looks of the place.  On those qualifications,Los Olivos would be a good fit.  Put it this way:  if you are looking for the hotties of Scottsdale, go RIIIGGGGHHHHT by this place.  I really think that they could do alot better with some cleaning up and  razing of a few areas.  But I guess.. if you are looking for good Mexican, maybe the grungier the better and the more real.  The cool thing about Los Olivos is that it has been in the same location with basically the same cooks and the same waitresses and the same family ownership since like the 50s.  You can't say that about many businesses anymore.  And that goes a long way towards what I think makes Mexican food good.. I wanna feel like I accidentally walked into someone's house in South Phoenix and the entire familia has gotten together for tia's cooking!  I have eaten at Los Olivos many, many times and I just think that the food is really done well. They have great chips and two kinds of salsa... hot and a chunkier, milder sauce.  Personally, I mix the two.  Their margaritas are addictive and my favorite restaurant item is their pollo asado- it is a mustard-marinated chicken breast that they serve with the requisite beans and rice and it is mucho good-o.  Their tortillas are made in the restaurant and I take a few of those, spoon some chicken on them, a lil' rice and beans and pico de gallo and whammie, a great taco that is reasonably low fat.  Hey, gotta keep my trim figure, right?  Their enchiladas are good as well.. lots of cheese and tasty.         So I guess I like this place as my fave for Mexican done right.  YOu just have to look past the icky surroundings and realize that GOOD Mexican is not about the location but about the food.  You have to  look deeper than the outside, like with people.  Wow, that was deep- I may need to go have a pedi and hang out at Kierland Commons to get back to my normal shallow, artificial nature."}
{"text":"Very underrated....  The food is fantastic...  I was in town for only three days and I ate her twice.  Try the Steak Picado or the Pollo a la Queso Crema. Both are delicious!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place ..... It's true Mexican classic home style food. It's one of the oldest restaurants in scottsdale and still owned by the original family. Good is awesome. Prices are great. It's casual. And staff if friendly. Always come back!!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's in Scottsdale.  Yeah the menu is inconsistent.  I don't give a rat's ass. This place is the BOMB dot com.  Their shredded beef chimichanga is the best hangover cure ever.  (Props to my bro for pointing it out) and their Chile Relleno is awesome.  The atmosphere is cool and weird, it's right next to SMoCA and it's still family owned and operated.  Also, step off the salsa.  The salsa fresca in the little caraffe.. you know the one with piles of fresh tomatoes and cilantro and onions and peppers?  It rocks my world.  It's not the only salsa that makes my tongue do the Snoopy dance, but it's certainly one of them.  The service isn't always fabulous but it's never been bad.  I admit the first time I went here I wasn't overly impressed.  It turns out I ordered badly.  The trick to enjoying this place is to get one of the dishes they do well.  For me that's the shredded beef chimi, the chille relleno and cheese enchiladas in that order."}
{"text":"Los Olivos is an oldtown Scottsdale landmark that serves up consistently good nuevo Mexican fare.  Ever since my introduction to Phoenix, Los Olivos is one of the better spots for me to satisfy my Mexican cravings.  Everything I've had here is great, particularly the cheese crisps and shredded beef tacos.  Everything else is relatively standard, although I was let down by their chile rellano before, it ended up being far to greasy and soggy.  The other thing to note is that there's not really any good reason to come for dinner, unless it's unavoidable.  Their lunch and dinner specials are nearly identical, yet lunch is about $3-5 cheaper per combination plate....   Come for lunch, eat some chips and salsa, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Starting with the good, the mini chimis are great and so are the chips and salsa. As for the rest of the meal, the soup was broth and 2 carrots slices, no meat, and was the saltiest thing I've tasted in a long time. And oh boy were the fish tacos fishy smelling in not a good way. Opening the togo box I was immediately concerned for my health and after one bite I decided better to be safe than sorry and did not finish that bite or the rest of the tacos. All in all I paid $40 for $10 of edible food. 2 stars is generous for my experience."}
{"text":"It starts with the chips and salsa which the chips are bland, the salsa is liquedy and tasteless.  The margaritas are good but small and pricey.  I ordered the carna asada and enchilada.  The carna asada was quite good, the enchilada was non-existent.  I think they just gave me the shell of it and was buried under I guess what was beans and rice with cheese.  The plates are gross looking.  Wasn't worth 15.95 that's for sure.  I think this place takes advantage of people, nothing special and not worth the money for the poor quality of food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is good. Service is typically spot on. Margaritas are tasty and strong! However seating next the a register on the wall kind of sucked. We always get sat in the same general location unless we asked to be sat somewhere specific. We will be back for sure though, the food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"my go-to mexican place!  i've been eating here for years and i love this restaurant.  it could probably use a bit of a makeover, but the food is authentic, fresh and delicious.  i probably eat here once or twice a month and i've never been disappointed.  they have a pretty huge menu, so there's lots of options for everyone.  they have some of the best chips and salsa in the valley-i always order an extra pint when i get takeout because it's really that good. the salsa has tons of fresh veggies and jalapeños diced up, so it's super tasty with the perfect amount of spice.  some of my favorite things on the menu are the cheese crisp with green chile, the mexican flag (3 enchiladas-1 beef with red sauce, 1 cheese with sour cream, 1 cheese with green chili pepper), and their beef chimi.  their tamales and tacos are great too!   oh and if you're feeling lazy, you can get their food delivered from delicious deliveries!"}
{"text":"Margaritas and all food very good. Service was always prompt and friendly. Plate of chicken fajitas was huge and delicious."}
{"text":"My uncle has been coming here for 58 years and has never had a bad meal. He always says coming here is like coming home!  I was real pleased with my experience. Had the BEST chicken chimi EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"We ate there Friday night  - place was packed and it took ten minutes for our server to find us, but once she did, the service was excellent. Are you people really that stupid that you don't know that the carafe of salsa is so you can pour it over anything on your plate?  and on the small side plate to dip your chips in?  it's perfect poured on the beans and rice; Jeez, you all sound like idiots for complaining about this like it's someone else's fault that you aren't smart enough to figure it out. anyway the salsa is award-winning, the cheese crisp with chiles and onions was very good, I had an excellent plate of Machaca which is very hard to find outside of Tucson, and Linda had halibut with a veracruzano sauce that was damn near perfect.  Negro Modelo on draft, and fresh coffee too. No complaints for me - and did anyone notice the front room dome ceiling done by Paolo Soleri? it is a spectacular work of art, as are the wonderful hand-drawn murals. there is a bit of attitude problem there at the front; it's because they always have enough customers to keep the place hopping - and there's a lot of reasons why"}
{"text":"Just your typical hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant... but I guess a little more popular in the Scottsdale area.  The guac was good, wish it had a kick to it. The decor was a bunch of painted wall murals, I think very typical of what I've seen at other Mexican joints.  I did have an interesting take on a chile relleno... 'Spicy Chicken Poblano' poblano chili pepper stuffed with spicy chicken, dipped in egg batter, then deep fried and topped with a delicious vegetable tomato sauce served with rice and beans.  Although, once I again i was decieved by the word \"spicy\" as this had no kick to it... it's what I typically call \"white man spicy.\"   Anyways, it's decent enough, but nothing that makes me think \"man I need to go back\""}
{"text":"Thank you for ruining my Saturday afternoon.  It's been 15 hours since I ate here and I am just now starting to feel normal again.  I've been eating tums and chasing them with soda (to settle my stomach) as well as making several bathroom trips.  I have never been this sick from eating anywhere.  I think Taco Bell would have been far superior and they don't even serve real meat!      The chips and salsa were okay.  My bf and I split the cheese crisp with beef (first mistake).  The beef looked grey  and the cheese looked old and overcooked. My entree was the chicken burrito,  I think they use chicken in a can b/c the meat was so dry and shredded.  The waitress offered a sauce on top and good thing I accepted b/c otherwise I would have had to choke down the dry burro.    Gordon Ramsey needs to take over and revamp this place.  The location is prime but it seems like they were just being lazy all around.  I think they need to pare down the menu because there are too many choices and most of it is the same crap just re-worded.  Also, I kept seeing so many servers standing around shooting the shit.  If you don't have any tables you could be helping out in other ways.     This place really lacked warmth from the staff and I think it's important to make your customers feel welcome.   I really don't see myself coming here ever again unless they make huge changes."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place based on many telling us we should come here for the best Mexican.  It was divey inside, but that was expected- the food was not good at all.  I have seriously had better Mexican food in Connecticut.  I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much from the outside but was a hidden gem.  We bellied up to the bar because the entire place was full on a Wednesday night with a wait for the restaurant.  Ordered a chicken dish the bartender recommended - was FABULOUS!  Will crave this meal and get it again.  Giving 4 stars because the place needs some cleaning up -"}
{"text":"2.75/5 underwhelming.   i'm generally not a fan of mexican food, so this may be an unfair review, but oh well.  whenever i think of mexican, i think of bold flavors, hearty, tender meats and sauces and creams and yum! this food was meh. nothing particularly great, it could have been wrapped in foil and i could have probably gotten it off a cart somewhere.  i think there's also something to be said when proportions are off. there was a lot of food, but i also got this huge tortilla bowl full of sour cream...just unnecessary. also, if the food needs that much, i think that speaks poorly to the quality of the steak fajita i ordered.  overall, the food wasn't very memorable, which was reflective of a fairly boring menu as well."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a good mexican meal but instead went to Los Olivos!  The ambience was ok; the food bad."}
{"text":"We went here for mothers day with a group of 25 people, grandmas and all. My Shrimp chimichanga was amazing and the rice and beans were out of this world, cramped but honestly accommodating such a large party on short notice on a holiday makes up for it in my book. Will return, great mixed drinks as well. Wonderful service."}
{"text":"Short and sweet. Great food but a bit high priced. The service wasn't bad, we went at the ultimate lunch hour with a full house so you're bound to fall into hold ups. The only unattractive thing about the locale really are the prices, I mean I understand the location is in Scottsdale, but c'mon now. It made me really appreciate my hole in the wall dive mexican food joints. I will say that I'm huge critic about hispanic restaurants salsa, and their hot is pretty damn good w/ fresh chips always."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a great mexican restaurant close to my office in old town that serves really good salsa for about 3 months now - finally found the place on Friday last week after I got over my brain-fart and decided to use Yelp! LOL  When you sit down and get your drink order, you get 2 flavors.  I only tried the regular salsa, as I knew I wasn't going to be too keen on the chili powder based salsa - never have been, it might have been fantastic, I just don't like chili/cayenne pepper based salsas.  The salsa I did try was fantastic, but it would of been nicer if we had little bowls to pour it in to instead of having to pour it on to plates.  I ordered up the #1 combination (I think it was #1).  Basically, it was a cheese enchilada, a beef taco, and a beef tamale (with rice and beans).  I had actually made a comment during my meal that the rice was the best rice I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant...no joke!  I'll definitely be going back over there many times over since I work within walking distance!"}
{"text":"I recently found myself at Los Olivos for dinner and was reminded of just how great this place really is.   I have been there many times and almost always order the same thing - the mini combo. It's a mini taco, mini enchilada, mini tamale and a mini tostada served with rice and beans. A plate full of mini food! Yea! Awesome every time.   On my last visit I decided to keep it simple and just get two tacos. Full sized. I got one chicken and one beef. I had never had the chicken and was pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite and discovered it was fried chicken! In a taco! Score.  Whether you like chicken or beef (or I think they might have shrimp) the tacos at Los Olivos are the best tacos in town, hands down.  And to top it off they have really good chips and salsa, which to me can make or break a place.  The other great thing about this place is the first room as you walk into the seating area. It looks like what a mexican hobbit hut might look like. Totally cool."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! My girlfriend brought me here for my birthday and we had a great time, she mentioned my birthday to the waiter and he brought out a deep fried ice cream with a candle! We'll be there for a quick staycation soon..can't wait!! Gracias!!"}
{"text":"I love Los Olivos!  It's an awesome, family run business in a cool old building.  The food is delicious!  Having been several times, I do not think that I had anything that was not good!  The bar makes a great margarita too.  My favorite dish is the shredded chicken burro with red sauce.  Its just as good as the chimichanga, but I feel much better eating it!  The cheese crisp is large, delicious, and very cheesy.  I love coming here with my family when they come to town to visit because eating at Los Olivos feels like you are at home."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are good. Overall this place was just dirty.  Never a fun experience when you sit down and food is stuffed in the cracks of the cushions.   I feel like this is that hole in the wall Mexican restaurant that everyone loves minus the amazing food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, cute decor, like the history, but food is average. My steak burrito was small and not a lot of flavor or sauce to give it some. My daughter and wife had very average quesadillas."}
{"text":"My first visit to Los Olivos was about 68 years ago, when I was a young kid. It's as good today as it was then, when the building was tiny, with maybe eight or ten tables. Over the years, consistently great food and service. Sour cream enchiladas outstanding. Cheese crisp also outstanding. Server Ana last week was excellent. I might move back to the Valley in a couple of years. If I do, Los Olivos will see me about once a week. (From our visit of 4 April 2018: there were 6 of us, so 15% gratuity was on our bill. I missed that and put a 20% gratuity on my credit card charge slip. But the charge just cleared my bank, and Los Olivos took off the 20% I had given. How's that for honesty.)"}
{"text":"Came here when I was in Scottsdale for Spring Training. We were craving Mexican food and this was the closest place to our hotel so Los Olivos it is.   The Chips and Salsa were brought to our table as soon as we sat down, chips were very fresh, thin and crispy. They served the chips with 2 canister-type things of salsa. They were both very good but I liked mixing the two, it made for one damn good salsa! My dad was in the drinking mood so he ordered a pitcher of Margaritas and man oh man that was a great way to get our meal started!   For dinner I ordered the Pollo a la Queso Crema, a flour tortilla filled with chicken, then fried, and lastly topped with a seasoned cream cheese and melted cheeses. This meal was phenomenal!!!! The seasoned cream cheese gave this just enough tanginess along with all the savory aspects the chicken has. Thinking about this, makes my mouth water and wonder if Los Olivos delivers to Northern California?!?!?  Next year when I am back in Scottsdale this will be my first stop as soon as my plane lands and the last place I go before I head to the airport to come home. AWESOME FOOD. Good wait staff. Wouldn't change a thing about this place."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by shaking up UrbanSpoon on my iPhone.   The goods...super fast service...lots of salsa (both hot and mild) is provided and the tortilla chips were delivered warm.  Iced tea tasted fresh.  The glass was refilled quickly (I sat at the bar).  Very cool building, the blue windows are very cool, looks like a spaceship.  I order a chicken chimi, which was decent.  It was delivered so quick, I didn't think it was possible to fry up a chimi so quick.  The not so goods... The chimi had a bit more tortilla than I usually like.  The mild salsa wasn't bad, but wasn't great.  It was a bit pricy for a lunch stop (for me anyways), not the best value.  I'd go again, but only if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Always good food an quick service. It's a tie between here an Frank & Lupes. I highly recommend trying it. It's a little pricy but what isn't in ole town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I wish i liked this place more because I love Mexican food, it's in a great location and it's huge. However, I think the food is pretty bland. There are so many good Mexican restaurants in Phoenix and I just don't think this measures up. I am a big fan of fish tacos and the ones here are just meh. Also, the last time we went someone ordered the queso with chorizo and everyone's stomach was hurting for a good 24 hrs after. I also think it's a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Cute little authentic place. Chimichanga wasnt that bad."}
{"text":"Great food, loved the decor and the staff was very sweet."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in here on a Friday night because we had a Groupon.  We ordered a couple of margaritas and an appetizer platter to share.  We were served chips, salsa, and water shortly after being seated.  The salsa was pretty tasty.  Everything on our visit was decent.  As others have stated, nothing was particularly memorable.  The appetizer was served hot but each item on the platter contained the same meat so pretty much tasted the same. Margaritas were pretty good as was the service."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Mexican food! My friend and I came here as per a suggestion from a local during our visit to Phoenix. The cheese crisp and chili con quest dip is to die for. My friend got the Chicken taco and the Fish Taco, while I got a Chimichanga. This is also an awesome location from Old Town Scottsdale... walking distance to the main stretch."}
{"text":"Really not good food. Very disappointed when we received delivery. 2 burritos - food was super bland. Meat was dry and the tortillas tasted as if they were several days old. Not impressed at all, not passable by any means and will not order from them again.  Should have ordered from our usual - El Molina down the street. Always good food, tasty and fresh!"}
{"text":"Hole in the walls are usually my fav but this place was nothing BUT a hole in the wall in Scottsdale .. I feel like if this place were located anywhere else but a tourist area it would be begging for business . Nothing special or stand out about the food or drinks .. nothing horrible, nothing great ... probably won't return , I'll keep going to my other hole in the walls that do sparkle."}
{"text":"Los Olivos has a special place in my heart. I grew up in Scottsdale and ate here often. Now, whenever I return, this is my first, stop, usually on the way home from the airport! It's delicious, the servings are large, and the ambiance is nice.  I usually order a cheese crisp (to share) and the #2 combo (shredded beef chimichanga with beans and rice). Don't get it enchilada style, why ruin an otherwise perfect chimichanga? The rice is okay (I'm not a fan of Mexican rice in general) but the refried beans are top notch.  I've tried a few other things, and you really can't go wrong. The tamales are quite good and the enchiladas are tasty. And Toni is a wonderful server!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The mini bean and cheese chimis are the besssst. Love the queso dip also. The inside atmosphere is always amazing. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"A Scottsdale landmark for sure.  We give 3 stars because they are good about reservations with large groups which we had and the lady who answers the phones and confirms reservations is wonderful.  The food was bland and the margaritas were small and bitter so I didn't even finish it.  I would have liked the chips more if I could have gotten more salsa but the service was slow."}
{"text":"They are now are favorite restaurant and we eat here at least once a week.  The food is amazing, I send all of my clients here.  Service is great as long as you don't get seated in the lounge area.  If you get there after 7 on a weekend you will have a wait to be seated anywhere, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Quick and satisfying. Overall, it was ok but definitely not the best in the area. I went with a few friends on a Tuesday for drinks and tacos for taco Tuesday. Apparently there is no taco Tuesday but that was my friends fault not theirs. I had the fajitas and they were actually pretty solid.   My girlfriend had a really bad experience though. She ordered nachos and frankly they were just bad. Dry chicken and bad cheese. Do. Not. Order.   The services was pretty good. The lady that served us was very kind and she did take care of our requests. She waved some of the extra costs that are normally included to accommodate us.   Overall it was a fine experience but I definitely would not end up here as my first choice."}
{"text":"Great place, great food. AMAZING hot sauce. Chimichanga's are too kick butt. Beer is in SMALL glass so I'd suggest sticking with bottles of Mexican brew rather than ordering draft.  Beautiful building, wonderful food. I've eaten here at least 20 times, any time friends or relatives come to town, take them there immediately and never a complaint. Have to look  on Yelp for all of the whiners.  Good eats, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Flavors ripe of the Southwest a solid 4plus. Had the burrito it was great.  Chips and salsa have two kinds and tasty. Ambiance is great and margaritas on point. Good people run this place. Even tho this place is a Giants hangout, Dodgers fans are welcomed. Go Blue !!"}
{"text":"I mean, it's just crappy Mexican food, but in the best way. The interior is actually really cool and I think it's fun to go with a big group and get cervezas and crappy food.   The tortilla soup is actually phenomenal and probably the one dish that stands out here."}
{"text":"Want a farm to table dining experience? Something with the freshest & most innovative Mexican cuisine? Looking for heirloom pickled radish and 48 hour tinga tacos? -THIS IS NOT THE PLACE-  What is LOS OLIVOS the place for?  Home cooked food, made with LOVE and lots...and lots... of fabulously delicious melted CHEESE!!! I had the chicken tortilla soup (which was bomb!) and a chile relleno (also yummy!), waiters kept my cup full and the complimentary chips & salsa flowing.    Eating here was a happy familiar feeling, the cuisine reminded me of being a kid and getting lucky enough to be invited to a friends' house for dinner who's mom always hooks it up right!  the food here is home-style... leaning a little towards tex-mex style, the only reason I can think of why Los Olivos may have less than 5 stars is people visiting expecting a different type of Mexican cuisine, I felt like I was let in on a little \"locals only\" secret eating here. LOVED IT!  ALSO: The ambiance here is great, I loved the strange architectural features of the dining room.. I felt like I was eating on the set of Barbarella, or maybe a dream created by Salvador Dali"}
{"text":"Service was great but food needs help... its not worth the price you pay for it was lack of flavor blah...:("}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday. Somehow, i remember it being better from times before. Do not get me wrong - it was good, but it was not GOOD. Know what i mean?  Wait was not too long, but long enough. Service was ok, but not great, pitcher of Margarita tasted good but was $36 and we only got kiddie size glasses for it. Food was pretty good, but not superb. Chips and salsa WERE real good. All in all not totally gratifying experience, unfortunately. Perhaps, i will bump up my rating after next visit.  \"It's alright\"  Eugene"}
{"text":"Los Olivos is a long time Scottsdale restaurant.  I went with family who had been there when it was new in the 50s.  It was OK.  We were seated in a room that was close to the bar, and it was SOOOO noisy.  I could barely hear the server, and the rest of my party (who are older) had a really hard time hearing her.  The food was OK.  I had the chimichanga with shredded beef.  It lacked flavor.  The salsa was good, but it came in jars you pour onto a plate.  It was much more wasteful and messy than providing a bowl of salsa.  The cheese crisp was divine.  All in all, it's far from where I was staying, and the food was only alright.  I'll keep going to the places that are closer and better."}
{"text":"We really need a 3.5 star rating, but since there isn't, we are going to round down since it's on the weak 3.5 side.  All that aside, the food is decent for Mexican standards.  They have a legit chili con queso (especially the one with chorizo too).  Think creamy velvetta cheese with chilis chopped up in there.  It is pure cheese heaven.  The food doesn't blow you away, but you can find some servicable choices that you will be satisfied with.  There is a shrimp in garlic sauce that is served with a guacamole salad that is really good.  You can enjoy some good guacamole with chips and finish off the rest with the salad."}
{"text":"Food mediocre and overpriced. The staff working there are not pleasant at all. The only thing that was good was the chips and salsa.  The chili relleno was greasy beyond belief and had a wierd tasting sauce which made it unedible. The beans tasted like they were straight out of a can and were not at all fresh. The shrimp was tough and had obviously been microwaved.  The margaritas were in a mini-sized glass, yet were $10. Waste of time and money! We will never go back!"}
{"text":"Was recommended this restaurant by family and was very disappointed.  Very over priced. Margaritas 9.00 each. Food was not that good. Bring kid's plate out so hot they get burned. Had to chase down the check. Portions small for amount of money spent."}
{"text":"Our family has been coming to Los Olivos for as long as I've been alive. A true Scottsdale landmark. Their tamales are fresh made and delicious, and their chile relleno is among the best I've had. Despite its popularity, it still has the feel of a family run restaurant. On the down side, I feel their drinks are over-iced, and their fish tacos are not the best. I also don't care for the shredded beef they use, but maybe that's just because I'm used to ground beef. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I ordered a bean and cheese burrito. The tortilla was dry and the beans were cold, like to the point were the cheese wasn't even melted. I was short on time, so I just drank my Modelo and enjoyed my chips and salsa  the service was good."}
{"text":"I was trying to find a mid-way place to meet a friend, so I got on Yelp to look for restaurants. Once I saw that someone compared Los Olivos to La Pinata in Burlingame, CA, I was going to try it. I grew up eating at La Pinata & have missed it for years. While the food was not La Pinata (& after 10 years, I may have built it up so much that nothing ever is) the food was excellent but the service was even better. I had a shrimp chimi that was delicious, but I have to rave about the wait staff. I had my two small dogs with me & my friend can't be in the sun. The staff set up umbrellas special so that we could eat outside without being in the sun. They also brought my dogs water and didn't bat an eyelash when I asked for a grilled chicken breast without anything for my dogs. My dogs are really well behaved & sat on their chair the whole time without making a fuss, but the fact that the staff at Los Olivos was kind to them without making a fuss & disrupting the conversation was priceless. I will be back. Probably tomorrow."}
{"text":"Quaint little Mexican place in Old Town Scottsdale.   I kept hearing good things about Los Olivos, so we came out here on a whim in July.   The inside was pretty neat, different themes for each room.   Our server seemed to be agitated with our presence, but was nice enough to bring us waters from the get go.  She even rushed us to order, umm whoa, simmer down, lady.   Cadillac Margarita will rock your world. Not bad for $8.   The salsas were lacking spice, and quite watery.   Dude had the Sonoran Enchilada, which was almost as good as his Nanas! So good. Wish I had ordered that, as I got a chili relleno, and should have known better. It was meh, eggy and runny.   We each had a green corn tamale, and those weren't horrible but not good either.   Pretty bummed after hearing such great things about Los Olivos from friends, but will have to give them at least one more try and perhaps update this review."}
{"text":"Stumbled on thus on our way to the SMOCA. Someone recommended it once before so stopped in. The staff was friendly and the food yummy. We both had the Sonoran Enchilada - my sister had it the way it's listed on the menu, I had them add shredded beef to mine. It was really good, the corn patty underneath was a great surprise. I suggest a side of rice, adding a little extra yummy texture to it. Clean, friendly, good food, and an adorable room with a blue glow!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here tonight and sat at the bar because of a long wait. Not there 5 minutes and this drunk A Hole at the bar starts talking trash to me and my son. I hear he's a regular there and married to a girl from the Philippines. He was kicked out of the bar eventually. I also hear that he has acted like a piss ant before while there. The workers hate him. If you go and sit at the bar look for a bald guy with a wife from the Philippines (yes that stereo type is real) and don't talk to them. This guy has serious drinking and insecurity issues. He will think you are trying to pick up his wife if you look at them.  What a nut case!!! I hope I see him there again without my son and we will see what he says then. Oh, the food is OK."}
{"text":"Mine and my husbands go-to for a quick dinner or date night. We LOVE it here, food is authentic like your nana made it. We recently moved an hour away and still make the drive. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"I just flew in from Los Olivos and boy do I feel gross. This place had 3 stars until we got the bill, sheesh. I never knew a heart attack could cost so much.   We came into the restaurant to find 2 high school girls at the hostess stand blabbing about God knows what. When they finally noticed us, we told them we were looking for a table for 2. \"We're pretty busy, hold on\". 5 minutes later the host led us a to a table in an empty room. Tables abound people! Strike one.  After an appropriate wait, our server arrived to take our order. \"This is our first time, any recommendations?\" I asked, \"Uhhhh, I like everything\"....Great, thanks for the info. Perusing the mostly unappetizing menu we finally settled on a couple of things and ordered. Strike two.   The food arrived, and it looked sort of appetizing. My wife had the Chicken Picado, which was pretty flavorful and delicious. I ordered, essentially, a deep fried chicken burrito covered in cheese. I made a mistake. The chicken was flavorless and the amount of cheese on the thing was pretty disgusting. I won't award a strike here, we'll call it a push.   Finally the bill arrived. WHAT THE FREAKIN HELL IS THIS!? Two drinks, two entrees, throw in a tip, and I'm walkin out of here $50 bucks lighter!? Ridiculous. A BIG strike three.   Whereas The Mission (right next door) is highfalutin, refined Mexican food done well, Los Olivos is family style, deep fried Mexican food....done poorly. With so many choices in town, I doubt I will ever return to Los Olivos. Now excuse me while I lay on the couch with a stomach ache for the rest of the evening...."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch. Guacamole, salsa, chips machaco, burrito, chimichanga and of coyrse, margaritas. A definite stop. Oldest restsursnt in town. 70 years young. Family started and run. Toni was our waitress and she was the best."}
{"text":"My 1st and only eat in Arizona. My friend, whom lived in Scottsdale, nearly 20 years ago recalled living this family owned establishment and insisted that we stop there for dinner, on our cross-country road trips from North Carolina. I was impressed. I had one of the most refreshing Margaritas ever, services staff and the food was delicious and tasted fresh. Most of all, I just enjoyed the friendliness of the staff and their family oriented atmosphere that the atmosphere held; you could tell they really cared. The main entrance is very cute too. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat there every time I am in town. The food, service and atmosphere is great!  Chips are fresh and thin the way I like and two salsas on the table. Writing this makes me wanting to be there."}
{"text":"The food at this place really only deserves two stars, but it's a decent enough restaurant to grab Mexican food with a large group while out in Scottsdale, so three stars it is...   I used to come to this place every now and then with friends while living in Scottsdale, and we all agreed that it was mostly for convenience & the fact that the people who own the place are very nice. In other words we didn't come for great Mexican food,..   I came here recently with four other people (one of which was a child) while visiting Scottsdale. I ordered a combination plate with a green corn tamale, chile relleno, beans, and rice. The beans & rice were kind of bland, but not bad. The chile relleno & tamale were both covered in the same green sauce, which was also kind of bland. None of the food was bad, just bland. Actually, the chile relleno was pretty good (it was cheesy).   The group I was with ordered queso dip w/spinach as an appetizer, which was actually pretty good! I have to say the chips & salsa here are pretty damn tasty as well!   The service is friendly, but kind of slow and not very attentive (everyone who works here is nice though, so I guess they make up for there shortcoming by serving with kindness). It took us awhile to get drink refills, but the food came pretty quickly. One thing that I think is really nice here is that they will allow you to pay at the front counter if you need to divide up a bill. As far as pricing goes I actually think it's a little on the higher side for the quality and what you actually get, but it's not horrible. My meal was $13 or $14 and I did have leftovers. In terms of atmosphere, it's cheesy Mexican decor (that's not a good thing or a bad thing...it's just what it is).   When I'm back in Scottsdale and want Mexican food I'm sure this place will get suggested. I won't be the one suggesting it, but I wouldn't be opposed to it if someone else did."}
{"text":"Great food, attentive staff, good drinks.  Chicken tacos were a big hit, as was the salsa!!!  A bit \"off the beaten path\" but good, solid Mexican food if you're looking for something more authentic.  Good place!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch before leaving for the airport.  good service.  Food came out pretty quick.  and good."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Been going here for years. Steak fajitas are soooooo good!! Salsa is delicious and always fresh.  Today is my birthday and this is were I chose to celebrate it!"}
{"text":"The staff is so RUDE!!!  Completely uncooperative. Called them and the manager said he was too busy to speak with me. Could not believe his response. I tried to order shots for fiancé's bachelor party and they were completely unwilling to make the night special. I was appalled. The manager literally told me he was \"too busy\" to speak with me! Unbelievable. Horrible customer service"}
{"text":"So sad that we didn't like this place more... a good friend recommended it, and I would consider him a reliable source so we were really excited for some good food. Chips and salsa were great, but it all went down hill from there. The margaritas were really limey and the food was pretty blah. We kept trying to give positives but it was a challenge. The staff was really nice."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and history of this place! 71 years family-owned. I will definitely be back to visit."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience... First of all making a reservation isn't even useful because the old man at the front door acting as host will maybe write your name down on three separate pieces of paper that he can't even keep organized. They should get a computerized system to seriously organize their wait times. We made a 7pm reservation and they totally forgot that, and made us wait another 30 minutes after 7. Total unorganized and unprofessional, thinking they don't even have to acknowledge any frustrated customers, everyone was dealing with the same problem.  Finally we just went to the bar to order drinks while we waited, and there was literally one bartender making drinks for the floor, you had to chase down a waiter picking up their drinks to even get an order in for drinks.  We finally sat down an ordered drinks in a bizarre dining area, feels like you are literally in Mexico its so random. After 30 maybe more minutes of waiting for drinks at the table and being totally starving and finishing our chips, we could finally order. The food took literally an hour and a half to get to our table. To say the quality was bad is an understatement, especially for $16 fajitas, are you kidding. I would have much rather gone to Taco Bell, Chipolte, even Filabertos... I had to spit out half of it because of such low quality. They tried to fill you up with the overflow of onions to make you feel full. What a waste of money.  We never got a refill on chips, we had to chase down a waiter again, and our drinks were never refilled. The busser girl was rude to my grandma, when my grandma literally asked for her name in the beginning. The waitress but okay, but still was preoccupied by being disorganized with all her other tables.  To top it all of, gratuity was added in, if I could've given a negative tip I would have. This place is disorganized, rude, and low quality. They should give up their prime spot in Old Town for a more professional and higher quality establishment to actually make my time worthwhile. If you go here, go luck. I'd save your time on Saturday night and hit up the local Taco Bell late night, at least they'll be friendly."}
{"text":"We had a large family group in town over the holidays.  Los Olivos was suggested because of its authentic Mexican food.  The location was Old Town Scottsdale.  Many in the group had not visited before but others had.  The restaurant was perfect and we loved the interior.  There were many choices on the menu and prices very reasonable.  Our servers were excellent and the food delicious.  This was definitely a great choice.   There were no complaints at our large table.  We loved it."}
{"text":"This place is a cute little Mexican Restaurant in Old Town. I use to come here a lot when I worked in the area, but haven't been back for a while since I moved. We visited this place last Monday night and I have to say it's as I remember it. The staff is very friendly and quick; the atmosphere gives off an old, rustic Mexican village vibe and the food isn't too shabby. The best thing about this place is their meal portions. Anything you get here is huge! You definitely have to take home left overs because there is just so much. This last visit I enjoyed the nachos, all by myself (getting my food baby on) and I took home half my platter. Of course in this case these nachos come out pilled with meat, beans, cheese, jalapeños..... on a pizza pan! Holy nachos!!! I feel the meat could have had a little better flavoring but the abundance of cheese was perfect! I love cheese on my nachos! My friend ordered their enchilada plate, along with that he got rice and beans. The enchilada was nice and spicy and the refried beans were pretty tasty. Im not a huge fan of rice, so in my book it was ok, a little dry.... But ok. The food didn't blow me away, but it hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Ate with extended family last night. Superb service, family friendly, food was fine. Really our server made the night. He was fantastic. Nice location too."}
{"text":"So as if the $4.50 Happy Hour margarita wasn't enough, I got an email from Yelp telling me I was getting cash back! I got 10% cash back on my purchase and I didn't do anything but pay with my credit card that I had on file with Yelp.  That's incentive enough to return, but the margarita was pretty good (salt was questionable, because... table salt?!) and the food was not bad either.   I was there for a party, but we had catered food, some chimichanga things, cheese crisps (is this an Arizona thing? It's weird, but delicious, so I'm not complaining), chips and all the delicious dips and toppings.  The ambiance in their pseudo indoor/outdoor room was great and it backed right up to the bar, of which was obviously necessary, so yeah. Oh, and it's really the little things, because as you leave, they have chocolate mints (2 kinds, actually) and a burro out the front door. The whole place was definitely cooler than your average Mexican restaurant. The food wasn't better than others, but good for sure."}
{"text":"The first visit it was pretty good so we thought we would give it another go. For me the quality of the food is more like fast food. The service is great but the food doesn't really taste authentic or dine quality."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I picked up a burrito on my way to the stadium and ate it there. It was puny. It didn't even fill me up. There wasn't any flavors to savor or remember. I mean it was cheap like 8 or 9 bucks but I asked them for their most popular item and that's what I got. One positive is they gave chips and salsa which was ok. Nothing special."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican food restaurant. Best salsa! Tortilla soup is so so good. Mini beef tacos with cheese!"}
{"text":"After the spring break game we decided to go here for dinner. I was excited to try this restaurant and waited the 30 minutes for a table. The service was very slow and the restaurant floor was very grimy. It took over 20 minutes for our order to be taken and they didn't want to make a shrimp taco even though they serve shrimp here. I ordered the fish tacos and I got chicken tacos instead. After telling them about the wrong order they brought me the fish tacos and they were cold and VERY dried out. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with their lack of customer service and poor food. They didn't even offer any compensation for their mess up. We will not ever come here again! There are many more Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area that have way better food and service."}
{"text":"SANGRIA....Always delish!!! This place is a Scottsdale staple... Cheesy jalepeno dip is amazing as well as the queso creama burrito. You will leave here happy...Great hangover food also."}
{"text":"Yuck.  I only went here because my manager was in town with me and says that he always goes here when he's in Scottsdale.  I'm honestly not sure why.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had enchiladas which were dry and gross, and no one else seemed to like their meals - except my manager who had tacos.  Maybe that is the thing to get?  I did really enjoy my margaritas (I may or may not have had almost a whole pitcher all by myself), but that was about it."}
{"text":"Had tickets for an event at the Scottsdale Performing Arts Center and needed a place close by to grab a bite beforehand. We made a reservation the day before, but when we arrived there was none recorded. Fortunately, even though it was busy, there was a table available.  We informed our waitress that we had a show to catch and she was very attentive and accommodating, suggesting items that would not take long to get out to us. We truthfully chose the place for its location so were extremely surprised that the food was quite good, plentiful and fairly priced. Certainly a good choice if going to a Performing Arts Center event."}
{"text":"It was late night open. I ordered huevos rancheros (breakfast at night lol).  The salsa was awesome, the chips was ok.  The huevos really is not the hits but it was ok.  I also ordered drink midori margarita on rock, this one was bummer. The flavor was like a mix sour pucker instead of real midori. Really not recommended this one.   I do love to go back and would like to try their other menu.  The services were great, they all very friendly, and fast.  The prices is little bit up then average for that taste."}
{"text":"Los Olivos Mexican Patio  I popped in after going to SMOCA for a quick bite while the traffic died down. The chips were served up immediately and they were hot and greasy. They provided 2 types of salsa and the \"hot\" had quite a kick. I got the mini tacos and the Mexican pizza. They were about what you would expect for the happy hour price. The Mexican pizza was pretty big and I couldn't finish it all.  This place is decent if you are looking for a basic AZ Mexican food happy hour. I wouldn't drive out of my way but I would go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I was there recently with some coworkers after a long day. This place was highly recommended after I said I wanted to eat some good Mexican food.   The place is beautiful, is huge, and has lots of seating areas, a huge donkey out front (which, sadly, you can't climb) and a small outside seating area.   I ordered the Mexican Flag - a plate that has three different enchiladas; a red one, a white one, and a green one. My friends ordered the carne asada, and a tostada salad. Those two dishes looked amazing when they came out! Mine, eh, not so much.   We also had margaritas which were so delicious! They bring you chips and salsa and those were very good, too!  But back to my dish.   Why only meh? Because sadly it wasn't good! There was soooo much melted cheese on top that you could barely taste the sauce of the red enchilada. The white enchilada had so much sour cream on top I couldn't taste the cheese under. And the green enchilada had no flavor.   I was very disappointed with my dish. the other two dishes, those looked great and my friends said they were delicious. So I guess next time I'll get something else than enchiladas. But I am worried that if a Mexican restaurant can't make a good enchilada? then what would the rest of the dishes will be like?   The service was good, the drinks were good, the chips and salsa were good, the other dishes were good. Four stars!"}
{"text":"I cannot give a good review for a Mexican Restaurant when they can't make good tamales. Sorry guys! It was mostly ground up corn and smothered in sauce and no flavors or seasoning at all. Also the fish taco was eh. Chips were good, salsa was super watery. The only decent thing I had there was the margarita, and even that needed a wedge of lime.  I will say we got a nice booth, and the live band that played was sweet. Service was so slow, our waitress only came around half the time. A bus boy refilled out drinks more than she did!"}
{"text":"Thought nothing could ever beat the amazing TexMex that's I'm used to but I was wrong! The food was amazing, we had the mini combo and chicken fajitas and it did not disappoint"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The chips are ok, but salsa was delicious. Ordered the tacos and fijitas... Try the fijitas, they are some of the best I have had. They are made with soy sauce which really gives it a unique flavor. Staff was pleasant. Definitely will be going back to try a few more things."}
{"text":"Took my family of eight there for dinner, great old school Mexican food. Nice atmosphere.  The server failed to tell me that she added a 18% gratuity. I tipped another 20%.  I made three (3) calls to the restaurant everyone apologized but no call backs and no credits.  Maybe the owner needs to get involved ?"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the staff was friendly and the service was outstanding as well. Some of the best mexican food I've ever had and I've had a lot of mexican food from a lot of places. Check this place out if you can."}
{"text":"Yummy!    Ordered the sweet corn tamale, bean burrito, rice and beans (all vegetarian).    A bit loud inside, but worth it.  Plus they have salsa dancing on Friday nights."}
{"text":"Just a quick review to praise the red hot sauce made at Los Olivos.  It is the best I've ever eaten!    I have been eating Mexican food since I was a little kid, growing up in San Diego.  I've eaten in little taco shops, from street carts in Mexico (Ensenada, Rosarita Beach, Tijuana, San Felipe and Puerto Penasco), and in sit-down restaurants.  I LOVE the red hot sauce and along with the re-fried beans, I pretty much can tell if they know what they are doing.    Try the red sauce.  It's hot, smooth, and DOES NOT have chunks of tomato in it.  It has tons of dried chile (ground, but with seeds visible), vinegar and other spices.  So good with chips (of course), but EXCELLENT on anything on your plate.  Take some \"to go\" and put it on your cheese omelet the next morning.  You'll come back here to thank me!  The food is solid here, old school, along with excellent shredded beef tacos, tostadas, etc.  But for me, the FIFTH STAR goes to the RED CHILE SALSA!!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Los Olivos on several occasions and have always had excellent food and drink.  The atmosphere is amazing, the food very good, and the service excellent.  In an era when many Mexican restaurants are trying to be upscale and expensive, it is refreshing to find one that sticks to its roots and serves people good food at good prices with a smile.  You will feel welcome and you will leave satisfied."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating at Los Olivos for the last 15 years.  This restaurant is authentic Mexican cuisine.  The place is run by family.   Sometimes you do have to wait awhile for the food.  The wait staff is usually pretty good.   The food is always fresh and served hot.  Today I ordered the Chimichanga plate.  The shredded beef is always delicious.  There homemade salsa is so delicious.    I'm not sure exactly what restaurant a previous reviewer ate at stating they ate garbage.  Maybe they were at Taco Bell.    You won't be disappointed with Los Olivio's but be patient.  Authentic food that's fresh takes time so enjoy visiting with friends and family while you wait."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night around 6:00pm. Thought we'd have to wait for a seat but the restaurant was busy but we got seated right away. Luis was our server and got us some water and took our drink order right away. Menu is a little light and the pricing is typical for a Mexican tourist area. Free chips and salsa. I was hoping for more shrimp dishes but found something to eat.  Food was okay, atmosphere was nice but the room was very noisey. Luis and another server were very attentive and friendly. I had a Groupon so all in all had a nice meal and the service was great. No complaints"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Fun atmosphere!  Food was fresh and not greasy!  Staff was friendly and super nice. Will Defiantly be back next time in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The good:  fast service, amazing chips and salsa, and delicious but not weak drinks. The bad: the cheese.... Meaning bad queso and bad cheese enchiladas. I really love cheese and they miss the mark.    This is a low rent dive type Mexican place."}
{"text":"I love this place! The enchiladas with the green Verde sauce are to die for and the pitchers of margaritas are very tasty too. Super casual and relaxed atmosphere. I Have been here many times and plan on returning many more."}
{"text":"Alright, let's get one thing straight, when one thinks of \"REAL\" mexican food, it isn't the boring and bland stuff you find at chipotle and baja fresh. The reason why Mexicans are so fat is because really Mexican food is fat, greasy and definitely full of lard (I'm Mexican so I can say that!)  That being said, this place TOTALLY DELIVERS! The food was very authentic, tasty and flavorful. I actually went two times this weekend. First of all, the chips and salsa are AMAZING. They give you two kinds of salsa, mild and hot. I only wish that they gave you bowls to put them in, instead of putting it on a flat plate.  We also ordered a side of guacamole, which I thought was very good.   Some of the other reviews have said you can't make modifications to your order, but that is not true. I asked for no onions in my enchiladas and they were happy to do that. The tamale was good and so what my shredded beef taco. Having that big side of guacamole definitely spices up the tacos!  They also have lunch specials until 4pm everyday!! They also have a decent happy hour (I've heard) and their beers are pretty cheap. I always love a place that has Dos Equis on draft."}
{"text":"The appearance of this restaurant is so colorful and beautiful. We took numerous pictures here. It is the oldest Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale, and it is named after the olive trees that used to grow in fields around its grounds years ago.  My husband and I went here on the suggestion of some locals who highly recommended it. The menu is large, but unfortunately does not have carnitas or mole on it. Instead of our favorites, we opted for a meal of carne asada steak and a chile relleno with rice and beans. The salsa served with the chips was good, but served in a carafe. I didn't get this, it would have been easier for it to just have been put in bowls. The chips did not seem fresh, either. However, the tortillas served with my husband's carne asada were home made!! This was a nice surprise. His steak was tender and tasty as well. The rice and beans were standard style. He liked the fact he was given fresh, diced green chile with his lunch, too. My chile relleno was fresh, not one taken out of a can. This made a real difference. I wish I had tried the flan, as I love this particular dessert.  Overall, this is a decent restaurant, but not the best I have been to, either. It's not a bad choice if you are in the area."}
{"text":"As always great food and service. We took our out of town friends there for lunch. Meals were perfectly portioned. Highly recommend the fish tacos."}
{"text":"This place is fucking awful.   I haven't been here in about 10 years or so and I couldn't remember why... well, I went today and it all came back to me - vividly. I told my server it was my first time in 10 years and she immediately said \"nothing has changed.\" Boy, was she right.  The food is a gloppy greasy gut grenade to begin with... The presentation is straight out of the 80's - huge portions of slop overcooked and swimming in an even more overcooked sea of diarrhea with some wilted iceberg lettuce plopped on top looking sad. It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen referred to as food.   All the food here is pre-cooked... meaning it is just sitting there over heat waiting for you to order it. I know this because you can't order anything special, like \"no onions\" in your shredded beef. The chicken was dry and clearly had been sitting on heat for several hours. It was completely vile.   We had also ordered a cheese crisp with ground beef... that was the description. It said nothing about veggies on it, but there they were - some pathetic overcooked hunks of unidentifiable veg trapped in the tar pit of cheap rubbery cheese and grey meat-esque vomit. It was sickening...   The decor of this place is a leftover relic clearly designed over 30 years ago by someone who was heavily into psychotropic drugs and Disneyland. That went along with the food which looked like it belonged in a museum (as my girlfriend suggested). The lighting in the room they stuck us in wasn't helping - it cast a blue hue from the skylights onto everything on the table making the food look even less appetizing. Aside from that though, it's kinda kitschy in both a fun way and a pathetic way.   I basically refused to eat anything from the menu (though I tasted some of my girlfriend's dish and the cheese crisp) and stuck to chips and salsa. The chips are the freshest thing sold here and aren't bad. The salsa isn't so bad either. We split a margarita just to sample it and decided it wasn't bad, but you could tell they put cheap tequila in it - beware of subsequent headaches.   It's a shame the food is so shitty because this place is in a great location. I can only recommend it for grabbing drinks with that hot GILF you found at the Yarn Barn before you take her back to her retirement community to bang."}
{"text":"I love Los Olivos, have ate there for years. A family favorite.The  table was sticky, the varnish needs to be redone. Dead plant strung across, ant on the table. table had tiles that were broke. Dusty and dirty decor. Fix the donkey out front this is sad. Do not get me wrong, I love the food and service but please clean up your dining area."}
{"text":"wow....i thought my best mexican restaurant was mario's in huntington beach, ca.....but then i moved to az and tried so many that did not compare to mario's....... then....found los olivos in scottsdale ....even the rice and beans are 100 times better...where have they been my whole life ******viva los olivos*****"}
{"text":"Very old and dirty not well kept. Food was bland used to be so much better! I would not recommend eating here,"}
{"text":"When in Scottsdale on my birthday, this is the place we go. It's an institution in Scottsdale. And it gets busy at peak hours, expect a wait.   Normally, I turn to my standby taco salad - always good. This time I selected a chicken burrito thing covered in cream cheese & queso. With a birthday margarita!"}
{"text":"Not recommended. Had to wait 40 minutes past our reservation time. Food lacks flavor and the restaurant is old and faded."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see that this place has such low ratings on yelp- it is one of my favorite Mexican places in the valley.  Favorite dishes include: mini beef tacos, Tapopo Salad (iceberg lettuce, cheddar cheese, chicken, peas, corn, beans, tomatoes and large amount of quacamole under it all), fresh salsa, and Tacos Al Carbon. All freshly prepared and wonderful tasting.  If you have kids, ask to sit in the blue room by the fish tank - the decor is fun and mysterious and will keep young children distracted thru the entire meal."}
{"text":"We are new to Scottsdale and really love this place. We've been there 3 times, and every time it's been delicious. The servers are cool, food is fantastic, and we even had a server bring out queso for us one night when I mistakenly ordered the queso crisp (a spinach crisp, also delicious). The drinks are also great! Needless to say, we love it and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Seemingly average to good Mexican fare in a cool setting, worthy of a visit for an out of towner.   Lunch specials are affordable and portions are plentiful. The servers were friendly and attentive, sure to keep my glass filled and the chips coming.  The chips are perfect...warm and crisp and the salsas were great.    I sampled beef taco and enchilada.  I'd say this was the first taco I've had that I truly enjoyed.  The chili relleno was not the best I've ever had, but was decent.    If you have the itch for Mexican in a cool, memorable setting, swing by!"}
{"text":"Have been going here on and off for over 20 years now and he i am yelping about it finally! This place is quite good. The food has always been good and the drinks. The only thing that urks me is that when something says a certain price on the menu or your chaulk board, I expect to see that same price on my bill, Not the 2-5 dollars per item added on. That's my only gripe."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to go to eat if I'm in the mood for some Mexican food. Even though the last time our waitress wasn't the best, but the buser boy was on top of everything."}
{"text":"This review is based mostly on service which makes all the difference when dining out. Diana was my server and she was exceptional. I was dining with my 21 month old toddler and she was so accommodating and thoughtful. She brought a styrofoam cup with lid and straw for him and was very careful to warm me of the hot plate when the food came. Her bright and cheery personality made me feel welcome which doesn't always happen when dining out with a hungry toddler! The bus boy was amazing as well. He made sure we had a constant supply of salsa which I loved as well as my son! Seriously amazing fresh salsa. Even as I was leaving, the hostess helped me carry my leftovers and opened the door for me. It is so wonderful to find a family-friendly restaurant. The food was good--nothing remarkable other than the salsa."}
{"text":"SON! Best salsa in town. I love going to this place. The staff is friendly and the food is good. Bot really authentic Mexican food, but really good American-Mexican."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed. We met friends there for dinner (their choice). It's a little dive looking today, but I'l sure it was awesome about 10 years ago. The service was okay and the food was okay, but I don't think I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant holds special meaning to my husband and I. He was born across the street after his mom went into labor during dinner, and then we had our first date there 28 years later! We live in Mesa now but still make frequent special trips to this location because we love the food, the ambiance, and the service. Always greeted with a smile when we walk in, and when we bring our toddler, they try to seat us next to the fish tank for her enjoyment. I could drink their \"mild\" salsa from a glass and the \"hot\" has a perfect chili taste to it. My hubs will order the #1 combo without fail (taco, tamale, enchilada) and I go between the mini sampler, the guacamole dinner salad (not on the menu anymore, but ask for it!) or the Pollo a la Queso Crema. The Cadlillac margarita is great, too. A little on the pricey side for a casual dinner spot, but we've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I gave Los Olivos two stars only because it is not the best Mexican food I've had in Phoenix...not even close.  We went there with friends for Cinco de Mayo this year.  That was the first mistake as we had to wait forever for a table.  We were seated in the room with the roll back roof where they had set up a stage.  Some really cute kids dressed in costumes came up to do some traditional (they seemed that way to this gringa anyway) Mexican dances.  That was probably the best part.  I judge a Mexican restaurant by its salsa...first disappointment.  It tasted like they had dumped Pace into a bowl.  I could have stayed home for that.  I had the fish tacos for dinner.  Sadly these were also crummy...perhaps I was spoiled after living in Los Angeles for six years...home to some GREAT fish tacos.  I think Los Olivos gets by on their location and tourists who don't know the difference."}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to eating here.  Taco bell would have been better.  Poor  service as well.  All in all highly disappointing."}
{"text":"It 's sad. But as other reviewers have shared, this place has gone down hill in all ways. Rude staff, slower than molasses service, DIRTY, sloppy, unappealing food (that is expensive), margaritas that taste like some tangy, sour tasting kool-aid-- and if you are unlucky enough to be seated in what I call the \"after thought\" corridor, you will nearly suffocate from the lack of circulation and heat (the narrow little seating area off the main dining area). I was EMBARRASSED after having taken out of town visitors to this place. I used to always rely on this place for decent food & experience.  What a shame it is to watch what used to be a valley destination go to complete waste. 1/18 UPDATE: I have added 2 more stars because it looks like they have gotten it together. I hope it stays this way. Ordered from grub hub twice and even take-out has improved!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit old school. You can find much nicer looking places than this up and down N. Scottsdale Rd. but you won't find better food. If you're all about the food this is the place you want to be. Margaritas absolutely kick @$$."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing!! Food is great! Love the atmosphere! And all the employees are super friendly! Highly recommend their house margarita!"}
{"text":"Great food great service yum We love to stop here while in Scottsdale not to be missed the tacos are great Husband loves the enchiladas too. We will be back"}
{"text":"Im sorry I would love to give this place 4 stars but I can't, the food is great, however the service suffers greatly. The bartender didn't even ask us if we wanted water or how our meal was, and we had to ask for everything. It was really a chore to eat there. Although the food was excellent, it's just the whole atmosphere with no music and unfriendly staff. I guess they have a goldmine and are not concerned with nurturing local patrons."}
{"text":"Los Olivos has been a standard in old town for years. It's a little older, dark, and run down, the food consists mainly of \"old school\" Mexican combo plates with rice and beans. ...and it's perfect!!! Happy Hour is good to - especially during spring training."}
{"text":"There isn't much I can say about Los Olivos except the food is consistently great. I had never been to the downtown Scottsdale location before. I was excited about how easy it was to get there and that there was a free parking garage right behind the restaurant. The service was very fast and my favorite is the food always comes to you hot. (temperature) I had the combo plate, one beef taco, enchilada, rice and beans. So good and favorable. The chips came out warm so you know that they're fresh. The topper was I had a 25 dollar groupon and could bring a friend to share the experience. Thanks Los Olivos. You never let me down."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night. First things first, the chips and salsa are OUT OF THIS WORLD! I decided on the Carne Asada and it was fantastic. My family got the combination plates and they were also top notch.   All around, I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone in the valley!"}
{"text":"One star is too many!   Horrible, terrible!  Last night we went there - my two daughters and a friend.  Having just gotten back from vacation, we were making the decision to eat clean so we ordered chicken breast (3 off us). The waitress said \"just chicken breast? Ok\". We added a side of black beans and received refried     Eating our dinner- our friend stops eating and says her dinner was terrible and chose not to eat it...  the bill comes and is $100.16.     Thinking surely there is a mistake, I look and the waitress charged 19.90 for our two chicken breasts!    So 60.00 for 6 thin and dry chicken breasts   I go to the manager and kindly ask if he could look at ur bill and that there must be a mistake. He felt possibly the same saying he would take care of it.   Total bill is now 78.00  Comes back to our table and says \"well you did order two breasts each. I took one off though\" we said \" your joking right?\"  He said \" no, and walked away. The waitress came over and we expressed disappointment- she said \" I don't determine the prices\" and also walked away.    Entertainment and older Hispanic busboy were excellent.  This place is dirty and grimey. Will never return.  So disappointed in the service, attention to doing the right thing and overall ROBBERY    This is my first yelp review so you can imagine how pissed I must feel.  #feelingviolated So tempted to dine and dash.  But....."}
{"text":"Nice server who did a good job.  Skinny Margarita was delicious but the food was average at best.  Nothing terribly wrong with it, but nothing really good either.  I would not be able to recommend coming here when so many other choices are available  nearby."}
{"text":"I like Los Olivos and regardless of their server issues I am understanding because they hire long-term staff and often family members. Some of the oddest server moments I've had are here, but I simply cannot give them a bad review for that because I keep coming back for the food. Their salsa is delicious, margaritas are perfect, and their cheese crisp was a part of my diet for a long time before I moved away from eating so much cheese...  One thing I will mention (especially if you are vegan), they use cottage cheese in their guac. I don't think that's right, it's clearly a cheap filler ingredient. Make sure to ask for it regular and they'll make it for you. That response was what got them four stars instead of anything less :)"}
{"text":"I had very very low expectations for this place. Normally I wouldn't visit a place with an average of 3 stars on Yelp, except for a local friend suggested it.  Apparently, Los Olivos is an institution in Scottsdale. It's in an old building that was built at the turn of the 20th Century and the Corral family took it over in I think, 1948. They haven't done too much to update the decor since. In a good way. It's charming in its connection to old wild west Arizona. There were old gelatin prints of family members who've now likely passed. Kitschy southwestern paintings. Wood carvings, Native American style. The ambiance is loud, casual and low-key.  On Valentines Day, we were grateful to have a reservation because the entire restaurant (of at least 100 tables) was packed. However, they provided us with quick service and our food came promptly.   We started with chips and salsa, which I think were free. The regular salsa was tasty and the chips were warm. A lot of water was separating from the salsa (see my pic below) but it didn't affect the flavor.  I ordered Machaca which was pulled apart beef seasoned in pepper and other spices. It was okay but I was in LOVE with the beans, rice and what seemed to be homemade tortillas. The tortillas were paper thin and wonderful.   Others ordered the chicken fajitas, which were apparently very good. I stole a piece of chicken to taste. It was slightly overdone, but the flavor was there. And the sizzle of its arrival had me salivating. :)  They allowed us to stay and linger and it was a very relaxing experience. I'd go again and get the vegetarian fajitas with extra beans and rice. :)  It's just a fun kitschy place that serves decent food. This isn't fine dining and you're not going to write home about it, but it fills your belly without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"If you want a genuine Mexizona experience, Los Olivos is your place.  Especially on weekend nights.  Go there on a Friday night and get your cumbias on. Seriously, amigos. This place has a huge room with a bandstand, live music and dance floor. It's pretty cool.  Unfortunately, the food isn't as cool.  It's pretty run-of-the-mill Mexican food. Definitely nothing to write home about. Or rave on Yelp about.   So save yer money and head over to Frank and Lupe's.  But get a pitcher of strawberry margaritas to go at Los Olivos first--the margaritas at F&L suck.  P.S. I really wanted to give Los Olivos 2 1/2 stars, but g-damn Yelp doesn't have a button for that. . .  Update: screw Frank & Lupe's --they suck too. Save up some money and go to Los Sombreros--great food & great strawberry margs."}
{"text":"I had stopped in there before the Baseball Rush the first time. Service wasn't so good, but the Food (Fajitas) was amazing!! The Second time, only a week later, and the food was absolutely Foul!! The Fajita Plate was not even warm let alone SIZZLING. Some of the food was actually way undercooked!! On a Fajita Platter?? Nope, shouldn't be possible. The Service was actually worse the second time around. I am not Picky, but come on. Should I return?? Which \"Cook\" will be scheduled?  Consistency is the MOST important thing to the hospitality business and they failed horribly.  Will actually \"Un\" recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, was immediately welcomed by the hostess, and seated.  Our service was very good, and the food was very tasty. Hubby had a HUGE platter of Nachos(I am not sure, but I think I saw part of the kitchen sink) and I had the Carne Asada.   My steak was perfect, seasoned well and tender, I usually don't like spanish rice, but this was very flavorful. My husband couldn't eat all of the Nachos. Kept our tea filled up, checked on us several times and were very friendly, we will be going back."}
{"text":"I really don't know how to begin this review other than WARNING this historical  \"Landmark\" restaurant is entirely OVERRATED: The food is NOT delicious, the price & portions are laughable, service is mediocre___honestly, the ONLY redeemable quality is the decor. I left this restaurant still hungry; more broke___feeling like I got taken advantage of by very  \"seasoned Old Town Scottsdale Swindlers\" accustomed to preying on innocent tourist. *Note: This place actually does not deserve the (1) little star automatically defaulted.  ZERO stars!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for happy hour at this iconic mexican food space in Old Town. extremely disappointed. HH is only in the bar. The bar only had seats AT the bar - the remainder of the bar was dark - no lights turned on. We asked if we could go into the bar area for HH and were told, no, there is no room. We took our money and our appetites to Cien Agave  down the street. will probably not return to Los Olivos...."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend love this place! It's a favorite spot for us. She brought me here while visiting before moving here and we've gone many times since. Very delicious. Simple Mexican food. Not the most authentic but good. I like it because it's simple. Their chips they give you for free are very good. It's disappointing that when they have deals like \"taco Tuesday\" it's only if you sit at the bar...most people don't want that so pointless and unfair. We get the tacos always and they're greasy goodness! Service is pretty generic. Nothing to rave about. We went here one Saturday night and they had a young man in a hoodie and torn jeans as the \"host\". You could tell he hated being there and was just filing in and pretty much doing nothing. That was a blow to service but it also didn't surprise me for their type of service."}
{"text":"The only saving grace of the awful restaurant was the guacamole . As I entered the restaurant entrance there was a pack rat full of smokers blocking the way in. Only to find out its the employees bitching about the customers inside . We were greeted by an Unfriendly senior Latina waitress not bothering to look our way, as if she was too tired to deal with another tourist as it was getting late 7pm  . Our food is at the table in less than three min  tamales with chile relllenos it was buried in a thick gloppy green  sauces that look and tasted like to much cornstarch was added . it look as if some one threw up on the plate just terrible ,a bland texture and taste along with a mushy non forgiving tamale . This place lacks so much . It need a complete head to toe makeover from decor to. Food  and honestly they  need to get rid of the front staff even if is is family a lazy group of unfriendly zombies    . I hardly call this Mexican as this place seems to of given up a long time ago  . Shame on my hotel  to suggest this  Pit hole I will be speaking to them . Now I wait in my room to start felling the effect of this abortion of food and what it is going to do to my stomach .     ."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch or dinner. Been eating at this restaurant since 1982. The food is always delicious. Family owned and operated for a long time the faces change and sometimes the menus change but the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito was good. Nice flavor and good meat. Guacamole was ok. Pick de gallo was fair. The other house salsas were good. Service at lunch was great. Prices are fair. Mom and pop feel to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was good but the age of the restaurant is showing for sure. I ordered the Los Olivos special of cheese enchiladas. I could never find them as they were smothered in cheese. Nothing Wowed me on my dinner plate. The salsa was perfect and I liked the salsa bottles. I just didn't get the value and why so much for so little. My bill was $39.00 for two people with NO alcohol. I was hoping for more from the Scottsdale Classic. It's a good place with tons of ambiance and charm."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere here. I attend their happy hour every other week. Now I just go on Tuesdays since it's 2 dollar taco night. If you like authentic Mexican food in a family owned restaurant this is the place to go. I never sit in the dinning area, always at the bar. Service is fast and the bar tenders are great. Happy hour is from 4 to 7 pm with 2$ coronas and 4$ well drinks, and they will even give you the remote for the TVs."}
{"text":"I came to Los Olivos because my aunt said it was the best. I can honestly say that my experience was one of the worst. I ordered a burrito but there wasn't just chicken inside. My first bite was filled with chicken, cheese, and steel wool. I swallowed part of this and it scratched my throat on the way down which made me realize something was wrong. The waiter apologized and took my food away and sent the manager over. He also apologized and said they'd take my meal off the bill. 10 mins later I was asked if I wanted anything else to eat. I ate one bite of my food and you think I'm not still hungry?!? What place doesn't automatically make more food when they screw up?!? This wasn't the end of the situation. I was stopped by the manager when I came out of the bathroom. He apologized again and told me this happens sometimes because it's the only thing that cleans the pans. WTF?!? You serve steel wool sometimes because it gets your pans cleaned? I don't get it..... Great if it cleans the pans, but what the hell was it doing in my burrito?!? And it's happened before.....don't you think you have a problem here?  Never again will I be eating here again, and never again will the rest of my group be eating there again. Don't waist your time, they feed non food items sometimes and they think that's ok"}
{"text":"This is probably my family's favorite local restaurant and it arguably has the best traditional Mexican food and margaritas in the Valley, which is saying something.  I've tried most things on the menu, but definitely recommend anything with shredded beef (esp. the shredded beef taco), the green corn tamale, house margaritas on the rocks and pretty much any style of enchilada - I'd stay away from the steak dishes and fish tacos though; they are good but I've had better elsewhere.  I'd like to close by saying, overall, this place is amazing because of the quality and taste of the food and the affordable prices.  Don't trust anyone who has given this place less than three stars - they are most likely morons."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying I'm not even a huge fan of Mexican food.  Now don't get me wrong.  I like it OK, it's just not something I crave.  My friend Bev brought me here for lunch one day because we were craving beer and a good salad and it has quickly become a favorite.    Thier chips and salsa are so, so delicious and I'm really picky about chips and salsa.  The chips are nice and thin and arrive hot and the salsa is fresh and just a little bit spicy.  Their margaritas are top notch (my husband always gets the Cadillac) and many claim that their's are the best in the valley.  I don't know if that's true, but they're damn good.  Now my husband is a huge fan of their Pollo a la Queso Crema.  It's a flour tortilla stuffed with chicken, deep fried (like a chimichanga and topped with seasoned cream cheese & melted cheeses.  You'll be my new BFF if you'll go halfsies with me on their topopo salad and mini beef tacos.  So yummy.  The topopo salad salad is a regular green salad tossed with the yuumiest vinaigrette then topped with mixed veggies and then chicken, slices of avacado, pickled jalapeños, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and topped with cottage cheese stuffed tomato.  And the best part:  It's sitting on a tostada covered in a thin layer of guacamole!  I know it doesn't sound that exciting or even that unusal, but it is so damn good.  Like I said, I'm not a big Mexican food addict, but I crave this place all the time.  Thier food is always really good, very fresh and never fails to please."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had -- and I'm Mexican!  Definitely a must stop in Scottsdale. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Granted we have been on an island in the middle of the ocean for the last six years but this place has great Mexican food and atmosphere. This place was recommended to me about 10 years ago on my first trip to Scottsdale and it was just as good as I remember. Everything I have had here is delicious and the staff is excellent."}
{"text":"We ate here on Cinco De Mayo. It was packed but we still had good service and didn't have to wait for a table. We were seated next to the fish tank which was great because it kept my 2 year old daughter fascinated. The decor is very interesting and there are plants and neat windows that give you the sensation of being in an underwater cafe.  The chips were yummy. We polished off like 3 baskets of them. The salsa was okay and yes it came in a carafe and we had to ask for bowls. Not quite sure how to fit my chip in a carafe.  I ordered the frozen strawberry margarita with no booze. It was okay but I've had better. My daughter liked it. I ordered a chicken chimichanga because the guy at the table next to me was eating a shrimp one, and his looked PHENOMENAL. Mine was okay but after I got it I wished I ordered the same one the other guy had.  My husband ordered a carnitas burro. It was, literally, meat in a tortilla. There was nothing else in it. No cheese, no tomatoes. Just meat. And it was completely dry. He wasn't thrilled.   We got a cheese quesadilla for our daughter, and that was good.   We would eat there again because it's better than the other Mexican places we have tried around here (hard to believe I can't find a decent one when we are so close to Mexico!) but my husband said he would order something different."}
{"text":"Since I live two blocks away, and this is considered a historic restaurant in Old Town, I decided to take my boyfriend out for a night of mexican food and drinks without having to worry about driving home. He got the steak and shrimp fajitas and a corona. I got the fajita taco salad and a margarita. My margarita was watered down beyond belief and my bf's beer was nearly warm by the time we got it. The atmosphere is unique and reminds me of old mexico city, but with that comes dirty floors, flies, and gnats. Although the presentation of our food was beautiful, the quality of the food itself was a bit sketchy. The shrimp in the fajitas were over cooked and rubbery. The steak was also way over cooked and tough, and my chicken was very dry which is surprising since it was fajitas. Nonetheless, we endured our drinks through slow service and mediocre food just to later get sick that night and the following day. Which resulted in a ER visit and a day of lost work. Lets just say I will never return. And there are more authentic mexican places in the valley that wont get you sick. No wonder this place is running groupons ALL the time."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa, plus great house margaritas. It gets busy in the weekends with locals and tourists, but it's never too long a wait. All the food is tasty so try something new to you."}
{"text":"I should have known better. I went anyhow, more for the landmark quality of the place and the quirky architecture than anything else. That is what the two stars represent.   The food was horrid. What happened to the authentic Mexican that use to be served here? Everything was bland, obviously under a heat lamp too long, lacking salt, spice or taste. Apparently anything can go out to a table if 2 lbs of cheese is melted over the top of it. Burned beans, cheese crisp swimming in grease and tacos with a hair baked into the shell.   This place really needs to pull themselves together and make some changes - too many other options these days."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a game.  We got seated right away and service was friendly. Unfortunately the food was not very good. Steak burrito was tough and overcooked and nearly inedible. Steak fajitas were also tough. Enchilada special was not very flavorable. Loved the atmosphere but the food was just not very good. Maybe an off night."}
{"text":"We have had to be at the local Honor Hospital nearby for several days and we are from Indiana.  This hospital had great food but needed a change and we walked one evening to Los Olives.  The food was outstanding, the service excellent and the price very reasonable."}
{"text":"Not bad, just very, very, VERY bland, American-Mexican food. The salsas actually were terrible. I won't bad mouth the restaurant, but I will never return unless outvoted."}
{"text":"We are in Scottsdale for the night and asked the hotel clerk at the reception desk to recommend a good and close Mexican restaurant.  He told us about Los Olivos and we were not disappointed that we followed his advice.  The restaurant is family-owned and operated and, according to the clerk, a local favorite.  The first thing I noticed was the charming structure and unique architecture character and design of the restaurant.  The atmosphere, complete with live mariachi band, lends itself to a delightful dining experience.  The salsa is AMAZING!  It was really so good, I wanted to take some home with me to pour over chicken, eggs, taco salads, etc.   The fish tacos were truly the best I have ever had.  We also ordered the appetizer sampler which turned out to be not great, so I would pass on that."}
{"text":"Not like it used to be. :( Ate here often many years back, and recently decided to revisit...totally disappointed. The food was decent, but so is Taco Bell. The major difference is that you get some chips and salsa with your meal here.  Not the experience I recall, and not a great deal either. Save yourself the money. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Should be 2.5 stars... Their chips and salsa, delish. I die. every time. The pollo queso something something...yummmm, so greasy and cheesy and spicy and chickeny and fried  $4 dollar margaritas? ok! The food here is typical yummy greasy Arizona Mexican food. It's nothing extraordinary, but it isn't terrible. What's terrible about this place is the service. Yikes! Every time I come here I am first ignored by the depressed 19 year old side bang lip pierced hostess. She really never makes an effort to say hello. I feel I need to overcompensate for the brattiness she exudes by being overly nice. Hello? I'm on the opposite side of the hostess podium, do your job biotch.  We are often sat at some odd random table, on our most recent visit being one with 2 or so extra chairs, that also doubled as the iced tea, water, and to go container station. I think it's best if you come here with large groups for this reason. They seem to reserve all the \"nice\" tables for them. Our waitress is usually a moody 40 something woman, that acts like everything she does for you is a favor. Literally, the waiters and waitresses here don't even bring your food, drinks, take your plates, etc. Now the men that do all this, I like. They're friendly, and helpful! I think it's a large extended family that still owns and operates this place. Which is most likely why the service sucks so much.  I still occasionally eat here, as my boyfriend loves the food, but the service needs some upgrading. If this wasn't such a tourist trap this place would have gone out of business long long ago"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food. Nothing special and other places are much better in the valley. Plus the North location closed. That does not say much."}
{"text":"This place needs help. The food is just plain bad. Just a bunch of cheap ingredients buried over with sour cream. Go to El Barrio if you get in or for something less formal go to Carolinas or Tee Pee. I went to Los Olivos a long time ago and didn't like it and it seems that it has gotten worse. One star is exaggerating its quality. Looks like I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a big group of friends.  The food is good, the vibe is super comfortable and since it's already going to be loud and crowded, your group won't stand out much.  I've been here for large group birthdays, and small group hanging out before a night on the town.    Food has always been brought out quite quickly, and with a big group if you give them the ok they'll bring food out as it's ready vs. trying to wait for the entire table's order to be ready.   Not only is the food good, it gives you that comfort food kind of feeling.  Yummy cheesy goodness."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the rice and beans, both very tasty. The decor was a trip.   The chicken tacos though...hmm. They were alright but I wasn't expecting there to be fried chicken inside. I was really hoping for it to come shredded. I wished it said that on the menu because I wouldn't have ordered it.   I'd definitely go back if I was in the area, and just get something other than the chicken."}
{"text":"I've been here a zillion times. The cheese crisp is really great, the chips and salsa are fantastic  (I love the hot sauce) and the Pollo con Queso Crema is tasty as usual. I've tried many items on this menu including tacos which are nice and crispy, the mexican flag is so good etc....here's why Im pissed....the prices have just skyrocketed! When I saw my bill today and there was 1.75 charge for sour cream, I about fainted. W....T....F? Seriously, its mexican food in a mexican food saturated city!! 1.75 for sour cream??? Nope, I just can't go back. Erika was our server and literally acted like we were bothering her by being there. When did this place get so pretentious? I mean....I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I am."}
{"text":"YUCK. And I mean that will all gusto behind the word. I absolutely did not like this place. It's very rare that I dislike a place this much. I usually can find something redeeming (like Los Olivos does have some pretty damn good salsa), but I could not see myself going here ever, ever again... unless my family dragged me here. They, of course, loved this place.   YUM. That's what my family said. I asked them what I should say in my review. My dad loved Los Olivos and said he'd rate 'em 4.5 stars. He only deducted the 1/2 star because they took our chips away before we were finished with them. I guess it was a bartering system: your entrees for our chips.   Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. After all, I didn't want to drown in grease, so I picked the shrimp entree that came with rice. I picked at the soggy rice. I nibbled on the burnt garlic toast. And the shrimp? Well, let's just say I wasn't expecting to have to work for my food. I had to peel the shell off myself. \"How do I do that?\" I asked horrified. Still a shrimp novice, I had no clue. \"You grab their little legs and pull.\" I nearly had to excuse myself to go throw up."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in the whole valley. Family owned, even \"grandma,\" waits on tables.  Their house margarita is great!  Chips and salsa, fast delicious and bottomless.  Service is quick and efficient- we never have to wait long  It's an old and wonderful building with a unique atmosphere... It's just the best!  I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a while but just came back today and still love it! I used to get the Chimichanga plate with rice, but I went for the beef tacos instead. Very delicious! My favorite shells are hard and fried with melty cheese all over...to the point where I can feel my arteries being clogged. This one was a little too crispy and could have used more melty cheese with a side of sour cream. The food here is still always amazing and authentic!"}
{"text":"Above average Mexican food with unique Archatecture.  Service so-so.  A good place to take visitors from out-of-town for a unique Scottsdale  experience."}
{"text":"Best mexican food i ever had friendly staff great steak fajita i will come again tourists from germany"}
{"text":"Waiting for good Mexican food visiting a friend of mine out here Best Mexican food for me service decour lovely inside and out. Carne Asada steak delicious Margarita refreshing"}
{"text":"I first came here as a child, late 80s. This was a family favorite. It's a family owned place, it should have that feel. I've been disappointed for years, today I came in with family, it's been a while. Disappointed, as I have been last few years. The prices change like the economy but you would think the flavor would remain the same, good homemade Mexican. Far from it. Taco salad in my home has beans, not a chicken salad mix thrown into ice berg lettuce w a lot of sour cream. It's gross, waste of money. The drinks are good, only thing they care about. The green chili tamale was bland. Too much salt on the chips. Two stars only because this is my childhood. Food needs to bump, people come and make it busy because it's a staple. 70+years, it's known. It's not great. There's better \"homemade\" Mexican than this. Phoenix."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD! Took my mom here for Mother's Day and we loved it! Will definitly come back. Was a tad on the pricey side. Paid about 72 dollars for 3 people. But was worth it. No complaints"}
{"text":"I would give zero. This is by far the worst Mexican place ever. They increased prices and the service is so deplorable... I hope this place goes under soon!"}
{"text":"I liked it. A lot.   My husband thought it was little better than Chi Chi's. Nice family owned and operated business.  Seating outside. Quiet.   Great margarita.   The best tasting pico de Gallo ever.   I can usually resist chips, but c'mon!  This was awesome.   My fish tacos were delicious. No complaints at all.  Hubs had the mini combo.  It all looked good, but he thought it was just so-so. The price is right,band you can get in without a reservation."}
{"text":"I just had the worst margaritas I almost tried to drink. It was also difficult to dip chips into salsa on a flat plate. I had not been there for decades and I won't  need to go back for decades."}
{"text":"The mini chimichanga was delicious. Really awesome salads and chips & salsas. The ambiance was nice."}
