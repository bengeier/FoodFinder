{"text":"I visited Montreal for a conference and some of my friends recommended this place for sushi. Coming from central PA, \"fresh\" seafood is not something you can get easily. But the sashimi at Kanda was very fresh! They have a variety of side plates, such as mussel, sushi pizza, and tempura. There were not a lot of kinds of rolls but most of them, I thought, were creative in some way. One thing that took me some time to adjust was that they serve you instead of a you serving yourself, which is more typical for a buffet place. All in all, I would rate this place a nice place to get fresh food at a good price."}
{"text":"There are four or five Kanda sushi restaurants in Montreal and this Kanda on Queen-Mary is definitely the best of the lot. In order to get high value for your money I'd suggest that you go to Kanda for lunch during the week. This way you'll only pay around $20 (tips and taxes included), however if you go there in the evening or on a weekend you could end up paying around $35 with not much improvement on the menu.  They have got a big dining hall with very friendly staff and very efficient service. I stick to Sushi but you can order rice, chicken or soup dishes (they're on the menu) or dumplings and vegetable Tempuras as well. Their best item in my opinion is Salmon Sashimi which is basically a big morsel of raw salmon. Try it with their pink shredded-ginger and you won't be disappointed. As for their Sushis, you can go ahead with Kanda Special, California rolls, Caviar and Eel varieties, all of which are excellent. Their Japanese dumplings and vegetable Tempuras are very good too.  The dinner buffet has all you can eat ice cream too but in my opinion it's a bit of an overkill. After having stuffed yourself with all the Sushis, Sashimis, Dumplings and Tempuras, it really would be difficult to have a go at your ice cream. That's why, in my opinion, the real value for money for this buffet comes out if you go there for lunch when you can have an AYCE for only around $20.  I go there once or twice a month and their quality is very consistent (both for the food and for the service). This restaurant is always crowded at lunch time from people from nearby offices or even from UdeM students (it's that inexpensive hehe).   So if you want to have a go at unlimited good quality Sushi without spending a lot of money, I'd recommend you go to Kanda Queen-Mary."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a friend a couple of weeks ago. Since this place opened, the quality has really gone down. We use to love Kanda but this was the last time. The food was horrible, the place was dirty and the service was non-existant!"}
{"text":"This is the best of all Kanda restaurants! The service is very fast, the food is amazing and the place is very nice too."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, Service, and Food: That's how I review.  Atmosphere: Kanda (on Bishop St.) is clean, proper, and cozy - perfect for those cold nights in Montreal.  For the summer time, they have a comfy terras in front - a nice touch.  You'll enjoy being at this place.   Service:  The service at this location is pleasant, but I've been to others where the waiters and waitresses attitude left more to be desired.  The service at bishop is friendly, but not dotting - it may sometimes come a little late if the restaurant is full.  Food: The sushi is middle of the road - not haut japanese cuisine by any stretch - however it is well made, well presented, tastes great, and there's a fair amount of selection options.  The place does most of its business due to the \"all you can eat\" buffet option - but watch out, the price for this option varies depending on the time of day and wether you're visiting on the weekend or during a holiday.  For the price - regardless of the differences due to time etc. - I find that what is received is good value.    Hits the spot."}
{"text":"Le meilleur endroit de sushis all-you-can-eat sur l île de Montréal, pour en avoir fait plusieurs. Lea sushis sont bons, le poisson est frais, les portions de sashimis grosses. Contrairement au autres places de sushis dont les sushis sont souvent plein de riz et avec peu de garniture, les rouleaux du kanda sont bien garnis.  En plus des sushis, il y a une grande variété de bouchées ou de plats a commander. Le service est  parfois un peu malhabile, mais je me suis toujours fait servir avec courtoisie et rapidité.  Je recommande vraiment ce restaurant. La nourriture vaut pleinement le prix, et il est possible d amener sin vin. Contrairement a ce qui est indiqué, le restaurant est toujours ouvert. Il est seulement fermé entre 15h et 17!"}
{"text":"As a served buffet sushi restaurant, Kanda would be a rare bird on the west coast, but is surprisingly a common style over here. For your $15-25 (depending on when you go) the result is very much dependent on the ebb and flow of the restaurant.  Why? Because you literally order from a list. Each table has a sheet that you fill out with a pencil - maybe you want 1 roll here, 1 gyoza there - in an all-you-can-eat format. Some food is going to be cooked specifically for you, while others might come as part of a larger batch. (There's a price penalty for uneaten food.)  In theory, this is great. You could order one from everything on the menu if you have the stomach for it! In practice, this means there is batch cooking, which means you might get something piping fresh one minute and something from the waiting line the next. (The busy nature of the place seems to ensure your food is mostly fresh, though.) For better or worse, the chaos spills over to the waiting too; while food delivery is almost always prompt, drinks/orders/bills may take some chasing to make happen.  I think the Kanda experience is best described as a search for \"surprise\". The menu is build to have you hunting outside your comfort zone, trying out various items you may have not tried before. As a group experience, that's great. As a seasoned sushi-connoisseur experience, you may want to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed coming here int he past, however I doubt I will be returning after my last experience.   When it came to paying for our meals, their machine was shutting down, and when I went to pass my card twice, it said it wasn't approved. I asked the lady the reason as to what was wrong, and she said she had no idea but that I had to pay, and that I should just use another card. Uncaring as to why the machine was not working, and a little curt, but nonetheless I complied and paid in cash.  Once I asked for the change back (I tip the amount with the change leftover, and always ask for it back, even though I do plan on leaving a tip), she asked if I wanted the full amount. I have to admit I was already in a tempered mood due to our previous encounter, but I still believe this to be rude. I asked for the full amount, and she said ok. They she took a look at the bill and stated that if she gave back more than $4.00 it would be less than 15%. I nodded and agreed and stated that is till wanted the full change back. She once again asked if I wanted the full change, and I felt it mandatory to tell he that I did plan on leaving a tip, but I wanted all the change back.   Once she returned, and after a rather long wait (I find it is always the case with Kanda in regards to returning your change), I had only $4.00 change, meaning they would get their 15%. I told her I would like all fo the change back, and questioned me once again. We cleared it up, and five minutes later I finally had my change.   To say the least, I left with all the money int he end, because I was shocked at the nerve she had for questioning me on the amount of tip I was leaving, even before I had the money back.   I have investigated over \"all you can eat\" sushi restaurants, and have found that Sushi St-Jean is on their way, though there are still some bumps in the road."}
{"text":"It's a sushi-themed family restaurant. The food is pretty mediocre, the ambience is neither here nor there, and the service is chaotic. A good place if you're going out with a large group and want something mildly exotic for a reasonable price. Not a very good place for a romantic dinner a deux.  The sushi is not as horrible as Sushi St-Jean across the street, but also not the rich flavour experience of Wi Sushi down the road. The rice is a bit dry; the ingredients and seasoning are unremarkable; the fish and seafood are quite fresh though. And if you're not into sushi but your friends drag you there, they have teriyaki chicken and beef, as well as other standard oriental staples like General Tao and peanut butter dumplings. If not, they also have wings and fries.  The ambience is a little confusing. They look like they were trying to go for an upscale setting, but they also have giant screens broadcasting sports games. The crowd is mostly families with kids and large groups of friends.  The service was very disorganized. We were missing utensils and extra order forms on our table; it took forever for anyone to pick up our order; we never got our tea until we asked for it, and even then we were given cups of it unlike the teapots other tables seemed to be getting; they messed up the amounts we ordered and brought us way too much; also brought us items we had crossed off the order; when it came time to pay, we left a credit card in the booklet, but were told to pay at the front, and when we got there were told to wait at our table for them to come around with the machine, then we saw them wave other people to pay at the front, which turned to be where you pay.  So if you're going out just to hang out with friends and grab a bite, it'll do. If you're going out to impress a date or have a culinary experience, skip."}
{"text":"Really good Sushi, all you can eat menu for 20-25$... pretty reasonable price if you can pack in 25-50 rolls of Sushi in one sitting. Ingredients are always super fresh, the caviar eggs are small and delicious, and the chefs do not get lazy and douse rolls with a mayonaise based sauce to make up for a lack of flavor. Definitely the best Sushi place on the West Side, although there might be some better deals east of downtown that merit a look."}
{"text":"Kanda is a reliably good sushi restaurant. Slightly upscale, with a price to match. Not appropriate for kids (although we did bring our baby with us once, but he was sleeping!) Nice setup and decor, adequate service and good food. A nice place for a romantic sushi dinner!"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs,unless your in the mood of soggy tempura,overcooked fried rice and crispy beef not even crispy"}
{"text":"We went for the all you can eat sushi and it was alright. There is a huge selection to choose from but nothing out of the ordinary. Service was quick , this made up for the food.   Located upstairs in a small strip mall, parking out in front so its easy to find."}
{"text":"Menu has shrunk and the price had grown since my last visit. Edamame was overcooked and grey. Nigiri and sashimi were a bit soft. Maybe not fresh? Wasabi was watery. Diluted?  Lunch menu selection of sushi is very small. There is far more choice of Chinese hot dishes. Why not just call it a Chinese resto?  Service has been so so. My wasabi was forgotten, and none of my maki arrived. Had to enquire.  Was never given a second sheet. Had to steal one. Maki was soft and too warm.   In all fairness, this place is aimed at uni students and so is a basic lunch place. But it has fallen far in the last 12 years."}
{"text":"Usual all you can eat sushi. Service was OK. Although the wait just to start serving us was way too longer. Off all Kanda's I was in unfortunately this one had worst service. But food is still great."}
{"text":"I used to be an avid Kanda customer back in 2006. It has been around 5 years since I had gone back. Kanda was extremely popular and had lineups going outside. I think the demand got so high that the opened up a few Kandas here and there and everything went downhill from there.   Unsanitary, not fresh, and the orders given were always wrong. When you would confront them, them would grab the correct one from the other table (even if it was already picked at) and just toss it on our table.  I got food poisoning TWICE. Never again."}
{"text":"Now this is the place to get sushi in volume. The chefs are great and experienced so quality is top notch for a sushi buffet"}
{"text":"Given my past experiences with all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants, this one is by far the best I've had.  The service was simply amazing, I really liked our waitress. She knows what I wanted and brings it to me before I even ask. She refills our table's teapot regularly, brought extra wasabi along with the tons of sushi we ordered, and was really caring but not intruding throughout the entire dinner service.  The sushis were prepared with more care and more expertise comparing to the Kanda on Sainte-Catherine, the Maki Rolls and the Nigiri Sushis didn't have too much rice, and the presentation of the dishes was surprisingly nice.  The Shrimp Tempura is a must-try, and the Jumbo Garlic Shrimp was perfectly cooked - buttery, rich, and moist. The Miso Soup was really watery and tasteless, there was not enough miso and disappointing. Also, avoid any chicken dishes on their menu, especially the Lemon Chicken, they're pretty bad.  The decor and the atmosphere were very Nippon-like and the tables were not too close from one another, love the music in the background as well.  This is the place to be if you're craving for sushi and ready to feast."}
{"text":"Pretty good all you can eat sushi! Big menu, lots of variety  Tip for students: $9.99 all you can eat lunch coupons for Kanda, you can get outside office of McGill International Students center. My son like very much!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi! Great for sushi lovers who live in the area. They forgot to bring some things we ordered and the service was a bit slow, but food tasted great."}
{"text":"Pretty good all you can eat sushi. They dont offer the full menu on weekdays for all you can eat which was a bit disappointing. The sashimi was good however and the waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"I don't know how or why, but throughout my life I've been to a staggering amount of sushi restaurants in Montreal. Is it a skill? A talent? An obsession? No, yes, and most likely. But out of all the places I've been to - and I'm very sorry to say this - this Kanda location is the one I like the least.  I've been to a bunch of other Kandas, and those were all fine. This one, though. The last time I went, I saw they'd hiked up their prices. Which would have been fine. It's an all-you-can-eat sushi place; you can get your money's worth if you try hard enough. But sadly, I was left with no motivation to do so.  The food was fresh, I'll give them that; and the waiters were fine, nothing abysmal to mention on that front. But the quality of the food was vastly different than what I've seen from other similar restaurants, and from other Kanda locations. The sushi was lacklustre and dry; the sashimi were cut way too tiny to qualify; and the regular food just had an overall bland taste that I can't really describe.   In a nutshell, it wasn't the greatest experience - even for a sushi buffet - and especially not with the price hike. I probably won't be coming back to this Kanda."}
{"text":"Got sick from the fish need i say more. Place went down faster then the titanic it's not what it used to be"}
{"text":"Sushi is of the quality one would expect from an all you can eat.  Not good, but not particularly bad just don't expect any of the fancy rolls you get at non all you can eat places.  The grilled food is loaded with salt and the waiters always make sure your cup of water is filled to the brim - obviously so you eat less. $80 for 2 people including tax tip and 2 beers is kind of steep for the quality you get.  Can get regular takeout of much better quality/originality for certainly cheaper price."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed our dinner here.  The menu for the AYCE is extensive, even apart from the sushi."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was wrong. The staff was rude. The entire restaurant is dirty. The food is disgusting (soggy tempura, no flavour, under cooked shrimp,etc.). Needless to say that both my girlfriend and I got sick from this \"meal\". Asked for a soft drink and was handed a dirty can, no glass. Served sushi that was prepared differently than described on the menu. Had to ask three times for ginger and wasabi. The entire restaurant was disgusting and dirty. I took pictures of the derelict state it was in along with the food stains on the walls and the carpet that looks like it can infect you with the bubonic plague just by looking at it. It seemed as if all the chairs and benches were different... this normally wouldn't really matter but they were all in terrible shape (pictures posted). DO NOT EAT HERE! There are better restaurants and if you absolutely want to eat at Kanda, eat at the one in Rosemere. It's not much further and at least they make an effort..."}
{"text":"This place has a super sweet location, being directly across the street from my school and all. I've tried probably everything offered on their menu or close to it and everything is normally super yummy. But I feel like the menu has shrunk since my last visit. This makes me quite sad because the fun part about all you can eat sushi is trying out the coolest sounding sushi possible. Their maki rolls seem to all have the same ingredients in them which is also disappointing. My favourite thing here has to be the peanut butter dumplings. The staff has been pleasant every time I go there. Overall it is a good all you can eat... But they could definitely use more variety in their menu."}
{"text":"I go here only for the spicy rolls and salmon sashimi and sushi. Always fresh, great spicy mayo. Best lunch deal and fast service!! 14.99$ all you can eat lunch!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch at 1 PM and the place was packed, as was Sushi St-Jean across the street. It took about 45 minutes for us to get a table (at least there was WiFi to keep us entertained), and by the time we started eating (about 2 PM) the lunch rush was about over. We had a lot of sushi rolls, which were all pretty good but a bit on the oily side. They also had a nice selection of other Asian cuisine (dumplings, pad thai, fried shrimp, edamame, etc.). After eating, we ordered bubble tea, which seemed like an okay deal, since they had a buy one get one free offer. However, the drinks took at least half an hour to come (we had ordered 4), and when they did, they were really disappointing. They were way too sweet, and the tapioca bubbles were all stuck together, which made them impossible to sip through the straw. It then took way too long again to get our bill, even though there weren't too many people there.   Service overall was lackluster, but the food was alright for the price. The bill came out to about 20$ since it was lunch."}
{"text":"C'est super pour une soirée entre amis. Le service est très rapide et la nourriture est bonne. Je recommande les dumplings... Ils sont fantastiques. Les prix sont plus chers en soirée que durant le midi (et le menu est différent), mais ils offrent des rabais étudiant. Ils chargent toutefois les morçeaux non consommés 1$ chaque ce qui me déplait un peu considérant que le buffet en déjà 35$. Aussi, ils ferment la cuisine en après-midi vers 2h."}
{"text":"Comme anticipé par la téléphoniste, la livraison s'est faite une heure après l'appel. C'est long à attendre mais nous étions avisés. Tout de même, une heure. Nos nigiris, en sommes, sembles êtres préparés à la hâte, sans trop de goût ni d'attention. Je ne crois pas avoir reconnu de vinaigre de riz au mélange. Dommage."}
{"text":"Really good all you eat Sushi, probably the best I've ever eaten. if your hungry and you want sushi definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Consistently good sushi place, with a pretty extensive all you can eat menu definitely a must visit you AYCE Sushi fans."}
{"text":"A vast variety of choices including sashimi, sushi, Chinese and Japanese dishes. Great place for a hearty post workout meal"}
{"text":"Arrivée: 9:40pm Pro:  service rapide et courtois  Riz frais Sushi bon mais rien d'exceptionnel  Cons: Menu en papier imbibé de soya et autre. Une assiette était sale  Salle de bains un peu sale. Un peu cher pour l'expérience générale surtout un soir de semaine."}
{"text":"One of my many visits to this particular kanda, the quality has come down quite a bit.. The teriaki salmon and steak were over cooked and serve luke warm. Kanda salad was wilted and decaying , should never have been served..  The veggie tempura was extra oily.. I guess the cost of a barrel of oil is way down so they can afford extra oil..  Total disappointment .. Will not come back.."}
{"text":"I said the other day that I love sushi. Kanda is one of my go-to places when we are trying to organize a bunch of people to go out together. It's pretty close to where we all live, it suits even the pickiest eaters and since we take our kids we end up getting the \"secluded\" room.  The one complaint I've ALWAYS had regarding Kanda is that their service sucks. Their waiters hardly speak English OR French. They sort of just nod at you and look at you like you are stupid.  You have to ask for water or ice or more food like 3 times before you get it....but then again its cheap and good.  Well...the good part is getting worse. I don't want good sushi I want AMAZING sushi. I understand you get what you pay for but their quality has just really gone down hill and the fact that the service is bad makes it that much worse.  I have to say that I believe this will be my last visit to the Laval Kanda. :("}
{"text":"it's a good deal for lunch , but way overvalued for dinners. Nothing special about their suchi, just the regular ones. the presentation can be much better. their staff needs better training and the ventilation is quite poor."}
{"text":"Good solid all you can eat sushi place, especially on weekends. It is worth every penny....nice selection of sashimi."}
{"text":"This place has gotten SO dirty. At first it didn't bother me, because customers dirty up places of business all the time. But this place is consistently dirty. The bathrooms are absolutely atrocious. I am confident in saying that they haven't had a proper cleaning in over 6 years. (That's how long I've been going to Kanda). Sometimes the sushi is fresh. Sometimes it's really bad. The service is ALWAYS bad. The workers there are miserable and have 0 customer service. It is almost as if they are being forced to work there against their will. I much rather go to a more expensive sushi buffet than go to Kanda, just based on the cleanliness. It really does gross me out. I can just imagine what their kitchen looks like. I'm surprised it hasn't been shut down yet by the health department."}
{"text":"The following is a precautionary tale.  As I was eating, I started to think about what I would write as a review. And it was going to be pretty good, you know... for the money that is. It's cheap for an all you can eat setting.   Everything was going well until I went to the bathroom. And I found myself face to face with the two dirtiest crustiest urinals I have ever witnessed in a restaurant. Let's get something straight right off the bat, they don't clean here. If they're not cleaning the bathroom (something we can see) what makes you think they're cleaning the kitchen?  A fellow Yelper mentions that the Kanda on Bishop has failed multiple food safety inspections.  I even took a picture, and I considered posting it. But this isn't the place, you'll have to take my word for it."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here pretty late on a saturday night, around 9:30pm and they close at 10pm so they were pretty much for last call on the sushi. It wasn't a problem for us as we just finished a long drive here from Boston. We ordered a ton of sushi, enough to make sure we were full and not too much where we cant finish it. The service was ridiculously fast and the service was nice. I would say if you weren't asian, or ate at a lot of asian places, you'd think they were rude, but that's just part of the mentality, which is high production. They were having a special, 3 beers or saki for the price of 2. So we ended up buying 3 beers and 3 sakis. The bill was pretty expensive, but I guess we ate our weight in sushi too, so I guess that evens out."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, I would've given it a three had the last part of my visit here not left a bad taste in my mouth. Server was ok, fairly slow, it wasn't even particularly busy when we went (10pm at night). Food was nothing special, your average sushi. I was part of a group of three and between the three of us we left an adequate tip based on the service we received. When we went to pay, we got a very snide look from the server which could've been let go, whatever...   As we went to leave we were approached by a server and their manager who demanded to know why no tip was left, accosted by a million questions - we said based on the service we received we felt what we had left was more than adequate. She then went on to say, \"Well, my servers will not get paid enough then\" To which we had to reply \"Why don't you simply pay your servers the correct wage?\"   We then said fine, whatever, we'll add on a few extra dollars. Without asking, she then proceeded to refund the INCORRECT BILL so we could pay it over again. The friend who's bill got mistakenly refunded then simply paid again, this time excluding the tip we had given previously due to his horrendous treatment. What kind of place will APPROACH YOU AND DEMAND MORE MONEY? If you expect an amazing tip, provide AMAZING service, or at the very least make great food. Neither was provided and therefore the standard amount of tip was given - which in my opinion at this point was too much.  Don't go here if you expect to be treated with common decency and respect!"}
{"text":"Le service se fait toujours très long, même en période peu achalandée. Le personnel est courtois, heureusement. On priorise facilement les groupes, oubliant le reste de la clientèle. Pour avoir voulu donner une deuxième chance à cette succursale, je préfère largement celles de Brossard ou Laval."}
{"text":"J'ai immédiatement été surpris par la qualité et l'élégance des makis, des sushis et des sashimis. Pour ceux qui n'aiment pas le poisson cru, on vous offre aussi une sélection de plats aux bufs, poulet, tofu.  Restaurant de formule «buffet» à volonté pour 25,99$ le soir (22,99$ du dimanche au jeudi).  Les règles du jeu sont:  formule à volonté. Vous commandé ce que vous voulez du menu. Si vous laissez des morceaux, il y a un supplément de 1$ par morceaux (question d'éviter le gaspillage). Tout le monde à la même table doit prendre le buffet.   Un petit conseil, lors de ma visite il n'y avait pas suffisamment de wasabi et de gingembre mariné. Il suffit de demander pour en ajouter. De plus, si vous commandent des différentes cuisines, surtout entre le cru et le chaud, les plats n'arrivent pas en même temps sur la table.  Pour le prix et la qualité, je crois que Kanda risque de devenir ma place à sushi."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi! The sushi is really good for a 25$ fee per person. Don't leave any behind or you will be hit with a 2$ fine for each sushi left behind. So be nice and eat everything :). The staff can be a little hasty at times kinda ruins the mood."}
{"text":"I don't think this is a bad restaurant but i don't think it is great either. However, since it is all-you-can-eat i think they put too much rice in many sushi entry such as Maki and hand roll. I felt like I was eating all rice. The quality of rice is also so so. In general, not a bad restaurant, but missing many subtle details of Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who promised me sushi buffet. What an interesting concept too, you fill out your paper at your table and they bring it to you. So basically its a sit down, never get up buffet. The price on a Sunday night was $24, and if you can eat a lot its totally worth it.  Don't over order and not eat it because they will charge you an amount per piece of waste, which makes sense. The service was pretty quick and everything we had was delicious and nicely presented."}
{"text":"it's a good place for lunch, a shorter menu but still an all-you-can-eat for 15$ and it goes really fast, you don't have to wait for your order.  for dinner it will cost you 25$, with a larger choice, but unless you really eat a lot (not my case), i found 25$ a bit expensive as the quality is correct, but not impressive, and when it's crowded the service is really poor, we had to wait a lot the waiter each time we wanted to reorder some food (and also wait a long time for the food, each time)"}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi place I have had in Montreal! The taste is horrible! And really less choice on the menu compared to other sushi places. The price is not valuable for what they offer! Never come back"}
{"text":"Very poor service, the restaurant closes at 10 the waiter obliged us, at 8:15 to have 2 orders and leave by 9:30 pm. felt as if the waiter wanted us to eat and leave asap"}
{"text":"This place is good for a \"quick fix\" sushi/schezuan meal. It's not pricey however don't expect great service or getting what you've actually ordered. I have been several times and the service seems to be getting worse and worse. Some things that are on the menu, they don't even serve!! You would usually expect the staff to tell you what was available and what was not, but it's not a the case here. It's a guessing game. I'll be honest with you, the bathrooms are not a very pretty sight. At all. Kind of makes your stomach turn to be quite frank. If the resto's bathroom is that dirty, do you really want to imagine the kitchen?? Like i said, for a quick fix, if you aren't scared of a nasty bathroom, it's fine; \"fine\" being the key word."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. I'd long been a fan of Sushi Palace up by Cote Vertu, and this place just gave it competition.  Same deal. All you can eat, you tick boxes. The food is all very very fresh and yummy. A more simple, basic menu than Sushi Palace, but somethings tasted fresher in my opinion. Just different, but excellent.   But another perk about this place, is that the seating/atmosphere is nicer, with the booths, AND its a BYOB, or for me, Bring Your Own Sake, which means serious savings.   We had a great time, and will very much return if we want sushi. This and Sushi Palace are now my favorites in Montreal."}
{"text":"I adore this place. I go here every time, I'm in Montreal. The all you can eat sushi is just fantastic. I can't speak to authenticity as I am not very knowledgeable. They provide great cuts of sashimi."}
{"text":"I use to love going here with family when it was open. We would literally stuff our faces until it hurt to move lol It's a lot of fun to try out different types of sushi, but after a few years, the sushi selections seemed to look and taste nearly all the same eventually, which was getting kind of unexciting. I guess it must be kind of expensive to make sushi so they had to cut corners. Their Asian non-sushi were always great though. Their crab pizza was amazing! Green tea ice cream was okay, the rest of their ice creams aren't really good though was as if they were flavored with powder and tasted chalky. I tried their bubble teas once, and I'm not a fan of those bubble textures in the bottom of the glasses I guess, but other people seemed to like them. I went on a date once there, and my date said that when he went to the bathroom, he saw one of the chefs leave without washing his hands.. which devastated me... but I'm not sure if he was making that up so that I wouldn't want to go there again, because he is not a fan of sushi in general lol Eitherway, even if that did happen, I'm sure there are sinks in the kitchen, where they wash their hands right before touching the food anyways.. at least that's what I hope for lol They're not there anymore, but at least there are plenty of similar places around."}
{"text":"Coworkers opted to order from Kanda for lunch, so I can only speak for what I ate. The sushi is ok but it's nothing that sets it apart from the run of the mill sushi you can probably eat at any fanfare in the city. Don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean it's bad neither....  I'd probably eat here again though I'd certainly like to see what competition is like nearby first. The price-tag was acceptable."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly. Been coming with friends and family since it opened. Management is very accommodating as well. The lunch special is such a bargain for all the sushi and schezwan you get. Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"When  Kanda  first  opened  this was a great  place  ..  Honestly  was  there  a least  once a  month..  This  place  is  degrading ..  employees  yelling  a  each  other  in  front  of  customers...  and  for  take  out  orders  good  luck! they  just  make  such  a  lousy  job lately. Orders are  incorrect  and  food  is  really  not what  it  used to  be ...  Very  sad  since  this  used to  be a  great  place  to  go  to"}
{"text":"Pros - Fast service - Clean restaurant - Nice ambiance: The restaurant is actually on the 2nd floor. It's amazing what a difference it makes to the view when you get off the ground floor. - Great selection - All you can eat!! - Weekday lunches are cheap  Cons - Sushi isn't at the same calibre as other places like Maiko or Aikawa - Weekend dinners get pricey  Conclusion: If you want to obliterate your sushi craving, it's time to stuff your gullet with raw fish. My record is 45 piece. Please let me know if you top it.  Warning! Every piece you don't eat costs you $1"}
{"text":"The place is called Panda price was about $23 per person plus taxes which are close to $5 per person, overall place is clean and calm ambiance, they had an extensive menu for AYCE however note there is no al la carte option - they had sushi , kitchen food , and asian fusion.  Ordered the sushi - salmon and tuna were good quality, the rice to fish ratio was good, the avocado was ready to eat, the wasabi wasn't the best- appeared dry , the beef ribs were good, my girlfriend ordered the pad thai she didn't like as if the noodles were overcooked.   Good benefit - BYOB, bought a bottle of wine from the market in front $10 and they popped it open went great with the food, overall damage for 2 $66 with tip and tax,"}
{"text":"We went to Kanda for lunch. The sushi took a while and they missed some orders. The maki sushi did not look good. The decor was out of context and the ceiling was dirty. There are better places for sushi at the same price."}
{"text":"Well ... After eating here and stuffing my face, I wasn't entirely disappointed . The sushi was bad yes but I mean it's all you can eat , what kind of sushi do you expect. Overall it was doable.. But then I got home and started to loose sensation in my arms and over the course of my digestion I began questioning my life and thought I was paralyzed from the neck down .. ( not actually ) but the point is you feel terrible after eating it"}
