{"text":"Service was exceptional. The food was great. Coming all the way from Maryland on a Canadian family visit, we started off well with the food part. I had the Chicken Adana and my husband the Lam and we both loved it.  Our server was the best. My oh My , can we get that in Maryland? Jk jk. Lol  We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Looks like I may be the first to review this place. Good. I often stay at the hotel attached to this place. I couldn't swear to this but it appears this restaurant has changed hands  a few times over the last few years.    Currently it appears to have taken on a Turkish flavour, and let me tell ya, those flavours are great.   Three of us ordered from what looked to be a comprehensive cheesy looking menu. I enjoyed a Turkish chicken shish. Never had it previously. My partner ordered a Turkish ravioli and her sister an butter chicken.   The food was really flavourful, hot and quickly delivered.   Now don't get me wrong. This dining room is not your posh spot, it's a large dining room with no character beyond that. But the food is real food none of that processed goop.   Our server was a young man who's first language was not English and the owner had to come to his assistance a couple of times. Everyone was friendly and we had a good time.  The server recommended a Turkish yoghurt based drink that was a taste treat!  I would recommend the place and I'll certainly return."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely brilliant. I stayed at the hotel here with my parents before taking off on vacation and they typically do NOT like Turkish foods, yet LOVED this place.  The owner came out and talked to us about starting the place up after his decades of experience in the service industry in Turkey and New York and is an absolutely lovely man.  I would highly recommend this place and I sincerely hope they do well here. Great people, great service and awesome food!"}
