{"text":"The atmosphere and service of the restaurant was great.  It's a beautiful space and it's very classy.  I was a bit on the fence between a 3 -4 for reasons I'll explain.  The food was good. Definitely better than average.  I got chicken and waffles that both came out hot.  The chicken probably should have been let to sit in the basket for a minute because when you opened it up you got a fair amount of grease.  The waffles were good, but fell apart quickly.  I'm not sure of that's a batter quality issue or letting it stay a little longer in the iron. But again over all the food service, and atmosphere was good. They also have an awesome live band on Saturday - keyboard, saxophonist, violinist and songstress, that played a delightful mix of old and new school. We were pretty close so it made conversation difficult, but it was a nice treat since they started at the end of dinner.

The only negatives were that there is no dress code, so it had a pretty young lookinf, acting, and dressing crowd.  I'm in my mid 30s and was probably at the end of the age curve.  Secondly the prices are too low by about $2-$3 per plate. That would normally be a good thing but for the clientele I hope the want to have and to stay in business they may want to raise their prices."}
{"text":"I had been hearing wonderful things about 7th District in Charlotte down here in SC so I had to try it out. My friend and I got there are 9pm and ordered our drinks and an appetizer. The Lava Lamp was delicious and fruity and the presentation was very nice. The Salmon Bites were delicious. My friend and I had been enjoying the smooth, laid-back atmosphere and hadn't realized, they had switched to the late night menu. We were still able to order the Shrimp and Grits though. Being from the the North everyone tries to make you try grits in and I loathed it every time. Grits had always tasted like flavorless baby food. One bite of these Shrimp and Grits though, and I was hooked!! The service was very punctual, professional, and knowledgeable. This restaurant is definitely comparable to the high-end restaurants in New York. I wish they would open one in Myrtle Beach but I have no problem travelling to Charlotte because I know 7th District will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"The place is really nice and my date and I got seated quickly since it was before 130am and there was no rush hour. Unfortunately, we did not enjoy our time because apart from each other's company there was nothing. We ordered a long island and red stripe. We kept waiting but 30 minutes later another server stops by and seems concerned...she asks if we had been helped and we explained to her that we were still waiting. She took our food orders which was the tacos. After another 15 minutes we got the tacos and the drinks at the same time. The tacos were cold. I was over it and let the server know that we were not eating cold tacos. It was just awful service. I think they need experienced servers and their spot could thrive!"}
{"text":"This was my husband and I first time at this restaurant. I had heard so much about this place. We went on a Saturday night and they had a live band.  I had the salmon and grits and my husband had the shrimp and grits. The food was great! I only gave it 4 stars because the band was so loud in such a small space that we couldn't really have a conversation. We will go back during the week and hopefully it won't be so loud."}
{"text":"I came out to a brunch event being hosted at 7th district not knowing what to expect being that I hadn't heard much about it. After walking into the establishment,I immediately thought that the place had a very nice vibrant atmosphere. Without even looking at the menu I immediately seen something that caught my eye and I knew I had to try it. The Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was very well seasoned and the waffles were exceptional. Definitely looking forward to going back and trying out other options on the menu. I strongly recommend for anyone who's into trying different restaurants with good food to put this one on the list of ones to try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Update: April 2017  - I came here in the evening when they had a DJ.  Today I tried the truffle Parmesan chicken wings and the four chess mac and cheese.  I was not disappointed. 

A friend of mine decided we would have brunch here on Sunday.  I was happy when I saw salmon croquettes on the menu but decided on the chicken and waffles.  The waffle option for red velvet won me over.  Ok, I was disappointed in the waffles. I think the citrus cream cheese drizzled on it took away from true red velvet flavoring.  However, the chicken was good!  

My friend ordered the salmon and grits.  It can with teriyaki sauce - how odd.  Anyway, it was a nice meal and I left full.  Next time I will stick to the traditional waffles or actually try the salmon croquettes."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! I had the shrimp and grits and was very impressed with my dessert as well. I plan to go back very soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good music, food,and drinks. Staff was on point. The bathrooms were actually the worst I've ever seen in a restaurant. I felt like I had walked into a gas station bathroom, and this really turned me off it made me wonder how clean the kitchen was."}
{"text":"This is basically a modern southern cuisine place.
I came here for girls night out and the ambiance is perfect for that occasion.
I ordered the pomegranate wings and 7th street sunrise? drink and split some fries with a friends.. I do really appreciate the fact that they changed the base liquor from Bacardi O to Bacardi Silver at my request - no extra charge. God because the thing cost me $12 anyway.
The wings were pretty decent, I've have much better. The sauce was too sweet for my taste buds. I guess I had different expectations since I've made pomegranate wings at home and my sauce was great (not trying to toot my own horn, but..).The ranch dressing though is pretty great. It definitely tastes homemade. It would be nice if you get more than 2 tablespoons worth in a serving though. I'm not a HEAVY ranch user and definite went through two containers with half an order of fries and 4 of the 8 wings that came with my order.
The fries were pretty good. Better than average but not too spectacular.
If you come here, be prepared to either wait until people leave to park or pay to park - might want to carpool. They have approximately 20 spaces dedicated to their restaurant. One thing I DESPISE is paying to park and then having to pay for my meal/drink. You should get at least $5 off if you have to pay to park.
I will probably return here at least once to try something else on the menu, but it's not high on my come-back list. It's a little expensive to me for what you get.

**Side note** They tried to get us to come back and watch the football game there. They have about 3 40-inch or so TV's. I don't think this is the best game spot unless you come to be more social than pay attention to the game."}
{"text":"Mediocre service, mediocre food. Maybe it's better as an after hours spot but definitely not our idea of \"date Night Dinner\" spot."}
{"text":"Was in town on tour and we like to try local black restaurants in different cities. This has been the worse so far. Best thing about my experience was the water and the music. Don't order the cheese sticks... they are not good at all... definitely purchased from Sam's freezer section (admitted by staff) which means it is imitation cheese in them. The wings were not good at all (probably were Tyson precooked) and came out cold. The grits for the shrimp n grits and fish and grits was cold also. So after letting the waitress know she took the plates back warmed them up. We didn't even finish our meals. The owner came up and apologize but only offered us free drinks which we declined. We suggested taking their value and applying to the bill (we had no problem paying something). But when the check came for the 4 of us... only 1 drink value had been applied ($12). We didn't even complain. We paid our $100+ tab and still left a tip on top of the 18% gratuity (for late night service ). But I can say we won't visit this establishment again when we tour to Charlotte in the future."}
{"text":"The food is AWESOME!!! The service was EXCELLENT!!! I'm in LOVE with the Atomosphere. Love it!!! Good food. Great music. Good vibes!!! Check them out!!"}
{"text":"Overrated!!!!! Drinks are overpriced, entrees are pricey due to the plates are skimpy. Ordered salmon and cheese grits!! The salmon was ok however the grits lacked cheese(as stated on menu-cheesy grits). Service is also slow. I couldnt imagine the service on a busy night!!

Paid-$86 for two drinks, salmon and grits and shrimp pasta and 2 pounds of crab legs.. aka two claws per person!!"}
{"text":"So let me start out. The ambiance of the facility is amazing.  Very classy.  But that doesn't compensate for the service I received.   I was the first person at the door and when we walk in we're notified that there is a 30 minute wait for preparation.  I honestly feel they should have came in 30 mins earlier instead of making a customer wait.
I was a little disappointed that 2 groups of women with sundresses came in 30 mins after me and received their food before me.  There has to be a Happy medium.   It's not right to let the \"sex sells\" slogan consume your site of all customers being treated fairly and equally. 
To be honest I wish had just went to IHOP but I tried to be a good person and support black business.  
This place will not be recommended to anybody I know
The food on a scale of a 1-10 was a 7 if the service was better I'd give a 8.  My meal was the salmon and grits."}
{"text":"I recently stumbled upon this restaurant on a random weeknight. The place wasn't busy at all. They played good R&B music that was low enough to still maintain a conversation with your dinner guest without raising your voice. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which was pretty good. The next time I go, I'll ask them to remove the large green and red peppers from my dish. The wait for the food was not long at all and the servers were very attentive. Oh! They also have free parking in front as well as behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Meh meh meh and I really don't like to actually pay for meh. The offerings are slim; which I get it...\"jack of all trades master of none.\" 7th district is however jack of no trade and master of none. I'm looking for something good to eat now to clear the lingering taste of mediocrity. Charlotte has too many great restaurants for me to even consider giving this place another chance. Hope your experience is better than mine."}
{"text":"On Saturday 8/27 after leaving the Southern Women's Show at the Charlotte Convention Center, my party of 4 agreed to have lunch in Uptown. My niece checked several media sites for both reviews and operating hours and affirmed that 2pm was when the restaurant opened. We arrived promptly at 2pm. There was no private event signage anywhere, and as we entered a hostess came up to the reservation desk, asked how many in our party and proceeded to seat us. First thing we noticed was a very heavy smell of GAS which permeated the entire restaurant. Windows and fans were on as if trying to clear out the horrible smell. Still we remained and while reviewing the menu, someone came out of the kitchen stating, \"they were closed for a private event and we could not remain\". In amazement we looked around and we four were the only people in the place. No obe else from the \"private party\" were there. No signs, decorations, balloons ir ither guests. As we gathered up our belongings and got up from a well worn sofa, no one said sorry for the inconvenience or even offered us any token of appreciation for stopping by in the first place. Parking is minimal at best , having counted exactly 7 car spaces directly in front, and other reserved parking at the building rear  which clearly established parking could lead to your car being booted. For a first impression, I was not impressed, leaving both hungry, annoyed and irritated. Perception is Reality in the hospitality business and this first and last visit made things clear. This is not a customer centric restaurant, and the employees lack the appropriate skill set to appease clientele. I will patronize establishments that clearly want my business!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. The food and facility are decent but the quality of the staff is horrible. This establishment is extremely unprofessional and lacks order. I had a situation where a female bartender was only serving her friends and ppl they knew even though I was there before those customers. I informed the owner and he barely did anything about the issue. I tried to support a black owned business but this place has a long way to go!! 

Cool hang out spot I guess, if u know an employee.."}
{"text":"I don't see any vegetarian options on the menu. I live in the neighborhood but probably won't visit for this reason."}
{"text":"I attended a Pop Up brunch at 7th district on Saturday, April 9th. The restaurant has been open for about 2 weeks and since time of opening have only served brunch on Sunday. When we first arrived, We had multiple wait staff attending to our table. They were very patient and wanted to make sure that we were ok. Our waitress ended up being Monique who is GM of 7th district. She served with a smile on her face. The place got pretty busy after a few hours and the owner, Josh Vereen, was also on the floor serving. 

I ordered Ny strip steak; it was over cooked so I sent it back. The second preparation was overcooked as well. If you like your steak red or pink in the middle, I would recommend ordering under your preferred cooking temperature. I ordered my steak medium but it was prepared to medium well temperature. If I were to order a steak again from 7th district , I would order medium rare. I tried the crab cakes which were seasoned well with little filler and a good amount of crab and the chicken and waffles; chicken was seasoned well but waffle was gummy. Overall look of the place was simple but elegant. A Lot of people attended the event but there was enough space for folks to move around and socialize. 

I will definitely be back to experience the live music on the weekends. I would also like to check out their happy hour (after 4pm) during the week that offers $5.00 plates and drink specials."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to 7th district. Both times superb service, food, and atmosphere. Very grown and sexy. The prices are super affordable and the food is definitely some of the best ive had in Charlotte. Servers Lisa and Ricky are the bomb! Very attentive. Top it all off with a DJ playing R&B at 10pm on Sat and hookahs... winning situation!!!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was outstanding!! I had the Cajun Shrimp Pasta. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The food... omg, I will visit over and over again! This is my 2nd visit and I've loved everything from the food to the atmosphere. mac and cheese , wings and meatloaf have been delicious so far."}
{"text":"Brunch Time with the Hubby. Decided to try the quaint restaurant 7th Street District of of Caldwell Street. Best thing is they have a couple of free parking spots behind the building. Beautiful mosaic tiled open kitchen with chandeliers scattered throughout the space. Brunch menu is pretty limited with a couple of seafood dishes such as shrimp and grits and other combinations with grits. We decided to get the main attraction \"chicken and waffles\". Chicken was well seasoned, waffles were good. Hubby got the red velvet which came with came with a cream cheese/citrus drizzle. I opted for the original which was good with honey and maple syrup. Overall good experience would return."}
{"text":"Very nice establishment. Customer service was A1. Disappointed that there weren't any tables available due to reserved parties, but we sat at the bar which was ok. Only had appetizers, the wings, which were very good. My dining buddy had the crab cake bites and enjoyed them. Will be returning for dinner and hopefully we will be seated at a table."}
{"text":"Food is very delicious!! Chicken with waffles or the shrimp and grits you will be very satisfied!! However, the service is not the best!! We were seated 15 minutes until a waitress came over. Other than that everything was good!!"}
{"text":"The ambience is really nice. The staff from the owner to cooks to bartenders are very friendly and down to earth. The lunch there is affordable and tasty, I had the shrimp wrap and my friend had the smoked salmon wrap. The portion sizes were good and the flavor was great. I recommend trying the signature drink & the jalapeño cheddar cornbread with honey butter!!! Good God!!! Lol! I will definitely be back to try different things."}
{"text":"Had amazing drinks and service.  I also had fried crab legs covered in garlic Parmesan. Trust me. It was not a disappointment ."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place. She ordered a fish sandwich. I ordered the fish and grits.

My friend bit into her fish sandwich and it was filled with bones 
The fish on the fish and grits was fried and filled with bones so that when I took a bite scooping it up with the grits, I almost choked.
The waitress had an very nasty attitude when we told her that the fish sandwich nor fish and grits shouldn't have bones as you could kill someone ... or at least warn someone 
below are pic of the bones that she found when she bit into her sandwich"}
{"text":"Very good food! The only reason why I am giving a 3 star rating is because of the service. It took almost an hr just to receive chicken wings. Atmosphere is pretty cool and they also play good music. I'll try this place again and hopefully they will improve their customer service so I can give a better rating!"}
{"text":"I ALWAYS have the WORST experience here. Let's begin by incorrect hours listed on the website. And on any given day they could be closed or out of menu items. Next, the service is ALWAYS poor. I brought friends from out of town for a good southern brunch. We waited over an hour or more for our food. Two meals came out (and they were cold) about 30-40 mins later the rest of the meals came to the table. We had no utensils to eat with and after ten additional minutes of waiting on silverware, we received plastic wrapped forks. 
Most of our orders were incorrect, ALL OF OUR FOOD WAS COLD...asked to see a manager. He/she never came. This is such a disgrace and embarrassment for any establishment to carry on in this manner. I only continue to come with the good hopes that things will get better and I to support a black owned business. This place is awful and I wish it really improves with quality of service."}
{"text":"Finally made it over after work with my son.  We tried the amazing crab fritters, the sensational lemon pepper wings and the fish tacos were just ok.  The music was awesome but the service was scarce.  Every time we needed something we had to find the waitress.....not a good look but the food is really good."}
{"text":"Good food a little too loud to have an intimate conversation but overall the food was good. I had the crab bites and salmon with grits which was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is new to Charlotte, but I have a feeling it will be around for a while. It's conveniently located in Uptown, near the arena. There's a good amount of street parking and a pay lot nearby (I hear they'll begin validating parking soon). On to the food, a few girl friends and I had lunch on a Saturday and everything was delicious and well seasoned. The drinks were strong, but not deadly - they weren't skimping on the alcohol. The food was rich and presented very nicely. The owner made his way around to all of the tables to introduce himself and thank everyone for attending. The head chef is Chef Leon and he's great. It's worth stopping by for food and a wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was headed back to DC from celebrating my birthday and I had an overnight lay over in Charlotte. So I decided to make the best of it and celebrate with friends. It was very close to closing time but Josh took great care of us. The food, drinks and service were awesome! I would highly recommend this spot. Thanks Josh! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here. The 1st time was on a Tuesday night, this time a Friday night.

Service was good from the bartender Keisha. But not from the rest of the staff. One of the bar hops came by and cleared off my drink before I was done with it. 

Our food took over an hour to come out. While we were waiting my friend asked to speak with the manager about how long we had been waiting. He had excuse after excuse as to why it was taking so long.

When the food finally came out, the burger that my friend ordered medium rare came out well done so she sent it back and she waited another hour and a half til it came back out.

In the end our food was comped and we only paid for our drinks.

I read other reviews which seem like a general consensus that this place could use some tweaking. I see the potential so I really hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Based off the food alone I'm giving this place five stars! My first time here but I'm sure it won't be my last, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Came in for brunch and bottomless mimosas and I couldn't have been more pleased with the service and the food. I had a breakfast bowl and the home fries were amazing, but the whole dish was excellent. My sister and her friend both got the chicken wings and waffles and the chicken was amazingly well seasoned. I didn't really have high expectations as I've never been to this place before, but the quality of food and the taste was so good I just wasn't expecting it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I had a bad experience. Tonight was my first time and will not be back. The only great thing was the salmon bites and after that it went down hill. I ordered grilled whiting fish with two sides. My order was wrong twice and they gave me fried. The third time it was white, pale, no seasoning and not grilled. The cook, who you can see I might add, proceeds to tell me he can't grill it...yet that is an option on the menu for that dish! On top of that, they allowed a barefooted man off the street, play his violin (badly, out of tune) and he continued to bother patrons going to their tables. Clearly this man had issues and needed to be asked to leave but they did nothing. When I spoke with the manager about my experience his body language and attitude was nonchalant and he could care less.  Luckily, the server didn't charge me for the fish. 7th district: lack of customer service, lack of professionalism and inconsistent food quality sums it up. Read between the lines of the other reviews below...I didn't and wasted my time."}
{"text":"Food was hit & miss. I went with a big group of 20 or so. About half of what people ordered was good such as my grandmas salmon which was amazing and the other half was just ok or inedible like my cousin's grilled chicken breast which was dry and had NO seasoning. When the plate came out you could just tell it was going to be disgusting without even biting into it.  I ordered the spicy Cajun shrimp pasta. It was pretty bland and mostly just tasted of spice with no real Cajun flavors coming through. Service was decent until it came to getting the check which took almost 30 minutes or so. Probably wouldn't recommend to my friends nor would I come back. This place turns into a hookah bar after 8:30ish as well which ruined the atmosphere for me. They bring in a DJ who plays music way too loud but at least the music choices were decent."}
{"text":"Stopped by for drinks after brunch. Was told they were out of almost everything. Drinks are priced high and basic. The waitress had no clue as to what was going on. Nice atmosphere but I won't come back for anything other than the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yoooo........
Salmon bites are legit, seasoned well, decebt portion. Mac & Cheese might actually be better than the one I reviewed a couple days ago. My gripe w/CLT not enough great Mac & Cheese...but this place does a damn good job.

Bar options...slim...but you really walk in here b/c you smell chicken...like a savory, looking for ya grandma chicken aroma from the street. 

Good for a low key, chill, out of the hustle bustle of Uptown. Everyone is friendly, attentive and plus they have multiple tvs around the bar."}
{"text":"Food is good, really good. The service sucks though. Waited 30 minutes for a table for 8 which wasn't bad for a Sunday Brunch and it being Tournament Weekend. We sat at the table for 15 minutes without a Server to at least welcome us or take drink orders or bring water. Needless to say when we complained and got someone over we had to order drinks and food at the same time. Al though our Server just came to work when she was thrown to us(Kai) she was pleasant and helpful. Now back to the food....the Whiting and Grits were perfect and the Chicken and Waffles were cooked to perfection. My Lava Drink was cute for the effects not taste."}
{"text":"Not worth it! Went for Monday $10 crab legs special the catch is each person has to purchase a drink or appetizer. Ok fine still gonna go for the crab. Thank goodness we got the appetizers! The crab legs were more like shredded crab. They were over cooked so u couldn't get any chunks of meat! They were cold and it was an overall waste of $40 will not return! Could've done a better job and had more had I made them myself!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I've enjoyed myself both times.My first time was for dinner and my second was a midnight snack.The collard dip is everything!The crab crakes are really good too.I like the atmosphere here.Most of the guests are young to mid-age professionals.The dining furniture is lovely.The R&B music creates a nice vibe.It different than your everyday CLT restaurant."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and atmosphere. The food is always fresh but I wish they were more consistent with their menu, there have been plenty of times where they didn't have entrees."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night, party of 3 . We waited a hour for our food , then I think they forgot to season my fish and grits . It taste nothing like I had it the first time . Literally no season . Was highly disappointed . Will say the wings came out really good though ."}
{"text":"I came up for my first CIAA and was told this after hours place would be the place to be when you arrive after midnight .. I came here and we wait in line 20 minutes myself and another guy with 4 girls which we had no issues not cutting line but that's not normal.  We still come in and PAY a cover charge for men and women . To then be told we walk to the bar that although they are open they are not selling alcohol .. first step as to why this experience was not ideal.  We then proceed to wait 2 hours for our food to even be communicated to us it was not coming no apology even after asking the status multiple times. Finally after telling the server I don't want my food AT ALL .. we finally have attention paid to us the manager comes over and tells us he will give out entry fee back and comp our meal which still comes out 20 minutes later :: because my friend who enjoyed their lackluster attempt to make up for it I gave this a one star review and I still refused to eat the complimentary food due to the seriously poor service that happened in my first and I guarantee only time I will be here"}
{"text":"I'm here with a group of 16. We had a reservation so they knew they had a large party coming. They have 1 server, Forest, who is great, but he is the only one here aside from the cooks. He is the host, server, and bartender which is causing service to be extremely slow. The mimosas are basically glasses of orange juice and it takes so long to get another round it isn't really worth it. The grits were good, but this experience is terrible. I ordered potatoes that never came out. Some of my friends had to send their waffles back because they were hard. A table has walked out because of the slow service and my party is getting more and more aggravated. Again, Forest was great. He has been running around nonstop and in good spirits, but it seems like management set him up for a failure today. Towards the end the manager was present. She never stopped by the table but she did help fix some of the checks that were incorrect. I'm assuming she was the manager even though she was walking around with uggs on."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. My friend and I came 1/1/17 at 2:15pm (they opened at 2pm) when we arrived the hostess told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait for food because they were busy. We decided that we would stay bc the restaurant was small & the crowd wasn't very large; big mistake. After we were seated it took 10 minutes for our waitress to come over to the table for our drink orders. Then another 20 minutes for her to bring our drinks & take our order. After over an hour my friend was brought her meal; whiting & super cold grits. The waitress said they were putting my wings in now for my chicken & waffles; after over an hour. My friend asked for new grits and after ten minutes she still hadn't received new grits and my food had not come. It was now 4pm & I was over it. We had the waitress cancel our orders. During this extremely long wait for food (of which mine never came) our waitress not once checked on our table. The person next to us canceled his check after waiting so long for food. After paying for my mimosa (given to me in a red wine glass) the waitress did offer my friend and I an expired coupon for 10% off our next visit. I'll pass."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 30 minutes to find out that the restaurant was charging a $20 entry fee. Wtf? So you want me to pay $20 to sit down plus pay for my food and leave a good tip???? #unacceptable"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a higher rating but it was such a struggle to get out food or service in a timely manner. We went for a brunch, a friend was hosting, and it was a nice atmosphere and music was great! Our server just struggled greatly to be attentive. It took us nearly 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 40+ to get our food. The food was great when it finally arrived. I think they need to invest in more kitchen supplies to accommodate a large brunch crowd. I had the red velvet waffle and chicken and the chicken was amazing! Super flavorful! The waffle was alright, fluffy. They have got drinks although they seem a little pricey to me. $12-15 on one cocktails and $5 mimosas. Overall it was a nice experience and I love supporting Black-owned businesses, but they have some areas of improvement. I will go again thought and give them a second try."}
{"text":"Customer service was good. However the food was subpar. They were out of salmon for my Caesar Salad and offered a Caesar and Shrimp Salad but the lettuce was dead and brown. I don't think I will return. #marketBENITEZ"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed because this place has so much potential, the ambiance is very nice. The menu looks good however majority of the food items are fried. The cocktail menu is very small. They display a few \"specialty drinks\" and list a very small selection of wine. Waitress couldn't tell me which beers they served. They should be more familiar with the bar menu or just simply provide the customer w/ a full bar menu. 

The biggest issue I had here was the service, or lack there of. The food took an extremely long time to come out, Over a 30 minute wait period. We had a table of 6 people. The waitress brought out one dish. And did not bring out the other 5 dishes until 15 minutes later. I ordered the grilled chicken. It was extremely dry and looked as if it had been sitting out. And not to mention the plate was cold. My friend ordered the same dish and her chicken looked and tasted as if it was freshly cooked, hot and juicy. 

I asked the waitress to bring me back a plate of hot food. She took my plate in which I had already eaten off of and brought back the EXACT same plate. I asked was it just popped into a microwave? She said no, I saw them put it on the stove. I sent the plate back again. How unsanitary?!? 

The manager comes over (with my same plate in his hand) and says \"what's the issue\" (with an attitude) I told him what the issue was. He asked me did I want another piece of chicken. At that point I did not want anything else from this establishment."}
{"text":"\"I dined in at 7th District for Sunday Brunch on February 26th, 2017 

The food was AWESOME! The service was very slack and not up to par. The server was very nonchalant and did not have a sense of urgency when getting us what we needed. We received our food without any silverware and had to go up and get our own after waiting an additional 10 minutes. The manager had no sense of urgency to come over to us and the server explained how they didn't expect any type of crowd which is the reason why service was slack. I ordered the chicken and red velvet waffles , too bad I couldn't enjoy it because of not having silverware or syrup. Never returning and I wouldn't suggest that you do either."}
{"text":"My friends had planned to go here for a birthday party. We got there early and set up the tables with gift bags and cakes/cupcakes...everything. After our party arrived we started taking pictures with the birthday girl and were told by the 'manager' that we needed to take our pictures to their 'picture wall' as to not disturb the other guests that were eating...so we go to this 'picture wall' only to find it was the sliver of wall in between the bathrooms...what!? Then the birthday girls food was cold and she had to return it. The manager then got upset because of an item in the gift bag that we did NOT know we couldn't have as it wasn't disclose prior to us getting there. She proceeded to tell us very rudely to put our items away and that she would yell at the hostess for us having it! The hostess knew NOTHING! Why blame her for something she knew nothing about! She then proceeded to reprimand her in front of all the guests (very unprofessional)! And then come to find out from the workers that this wasn't even the real 'manager' and that she frequently gets complaints from guests! This was my first time going to this restaurant but after the first impression they left, I will not be returning. Your guests shouldn't leave feeling like an inconvenience to you!"}
{"text":"My colleagues and I found this spot on yelp. We decided to go for happy hour and actually enjoyed it very much. The drinks were really strong. We only ordered appetizers and drinks. What we did order was good. It's a wonderfully decorated space that would be nice for a date or a girls night."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere! Food was great; service was great and friends loved the ambience .. definetly will return and suggest for friends"}
{"text":"This place I okay.. I'd maybe try it one more time and I'd go during the day when they have more food options. The music is loud like club music not that that's a problem or anything. But $15 for a drink and cold ass shrimp and grits. (The shrimp and grits are better at Midnight Diner and cheaper) I was unhappy and really don't like that they add on the tip for late nights. So I don't know if I'd go back.."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night & both of our first times there. Walked in to a half full restaurant with overly loud music, but i didnt mind. Our server INITALLY approached up promptly and with a smile i'll add. But that was the first and last time Sharon came to the table in a timely manner. Coughs AND rolls eyes. Ordered two waters and a drink. Took 15min. unfortunately we were not ready to order when we returned. I honestly could tell you how long we waited this long but i will say i looked around changed seats and looked around some more. Did not see her anywhere by the way. She comes & takes our order. Our apps come i get the salmon bites, which were amazing! We also ordered the cheese sticks. She placed the apps on the table so we then ask for marinara sauce and lol her reply is so we dont have any but i can go look (somewhere) to see id we have some. Do you want some? Umm what do you think & why didnt you do that already? Anyway, brings it. Few min later she brings out ONE of TWO entrees the whiting, shrimp and fries. Not the lemon pepper salmon, mashed, and collards. (Side eye). I literally waited 15min to get my food after the first entree was dropped. Not once did she check on either one of the entrees after she placed them. She goes MIA again! Who knows how long. She finally comes past us so we ask for a box and the check. She then brings a check with gratuity added for a party of 2 lol yall when i say i was weak i was lol. So you give TERRIBLE service then try to steal $15 from me? Haha NO! She tales so long to come back i then got the manager woman that was near by to run it AND i asked her is grat auto added on parties of two? She twist up her face & said no then looks at the check & asks how many people were in our party lol.. we say TWO lol.. she then says after a certain time lol.. it was right b4 11 lol .. then she says she'll adjust it lol.. just lying. Lol.. so the server drops the check & i ask her for a bag (rolls eyes extremely) she goes in the back somewhere so i ask another server for the bag then BOOM theres a bag! Lol the food was great but the service was TERRIBLE & the server is a thief lol"}
{"text":"This is definitely not the same restaurant it was a year or two ago. I haven't been in a while bc they always seemed to change their hours. Monday nights use to always draw a large lively crowd with their great DJ and crab leg special $10 a lb. When I walked in tonight the restaurant was empty compared to the usual crowd. There was only one waitress/ host and one bartender. The menu didn't list the crab leg special but the waitress said it was $14.99. I'm so glad I asked ahead of time. I ordered the garlic Parmesan crab leg. When it arrived, it was definitely not what I was expecting. In the past, it was seasoned with garlic, butter, and shaved Parmesan sprinkles. This dish tonight had a Parmesan cream sauce. I hated the taste plus parts of the legs were ice cold. I sent it back and waited for my Mac and cheese to come out. There was no bread or crackers to eat while I waited. When the Mac and cheese came out it was cold in the center. I sent it back and asked the waitress to make sure my crab legs would be hot too! Next thing I know, I hear one of the cooks yell\" what else she want?!\" I was appalled by his lack of professionalism. Then I hear him yell again to the waitress to wait so he could fix something on my plate. I could hear him from the front of the restaurant \"I know she's going to find something else to complain about.!\" I was beyond furious. It took everything within not to go off. If I didn't have an event to go to after I would've sent it all back. Not one manger came out to apologize or check to see if everything was ok. Now it makes sense why the restaurant was empty. Side note...Mac and cheese was delicious when it was hot! Everything else was mediocre. Take note on the tiny piece of corn in the picture."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Our waitress was nice. The drink menu was feasible. We went during brunch, there wasn't a large selection and they ran out of two of the items on the menu. My order was brought out to me 20 mins after everyone else at my table received theirs. Apparently there was a mix up in the kitchen. I'd give them another try for the sole purpose of eating the fish and grits again. The grits were creamy and the fish was seasoned to perfection."}
{"text":"Service was piss poor. Management was neither apologetic or helpful for the lack of service that was provided. We were seated and were never greeted by a waitress to take our order. The manager alluded that maybe if we had called ahead or knew someone there that maybe we would have been taken care of. I've since spoken to several other people who have had similar if not worse experiences with the customer service at this establishment. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"kia thank you for your hospitality..the fried crab legs are a must.....i enjoyed your service"}
{"text":"Best spot in Charlotte go to  Vist, staff was on point and owners are always there to help Friday night ladies night always beautiful women in there .Dj has the spot rocking"}
{"text":"I came to Charlotte for New Year's Eve and was looking forward to An awesome NYE brunch to kickstart the day. There was a large group of us (15+) but upon attempting to order and get our mimosas flowing, we noticed that there was only ONE waiter in the restaurant. Aside from the cooks, it was just him. He was the host, waiter, food runner, complaint taker and everything in between. Forest, the waiter was on his game and did the very best he could, but the restaurant had him set up for failure. He mentioned he doesn't typically work brunch but was called in for the day. They should've called in a few other waiters as well, cause I mean, DUH?! It's NYE and there's going to be a crowd, period. One table even walked out because they weren't waited on quick enough. As for the food, the fish could've been seasoned a whole lot more but the grits were straight. The mimosas were in all actuality orange juice with a splash of bubble and idk about you, but I like my mimosas with just a dash of orange juice, because unlimited mimosas should have you day drunk (that's the point isn't it?) Anywho, our waiter did his best and overall the experience was lackluster and left much to be desired. If it weren't for Forest, I would've given 2 stars."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaay!!!!! A new spot with flavor? Bring it on! Visited here on a Friday night to have a drink and a quick bite with a friend. To sum it up, I loved the decor - a sultry black and red with a beautiful floor to ceiling tile wall. We were seated immediately and ordered drinks. Their signature drinks are a little pricey, ranging from $11-15. However, they had drink specials (Friday is ladies night) and there were $5 cocktails. Had Bacardi rum w/ Pineapple and grenadine $5.00 and they weren't stingy with the booze. One was enough for a small buzz to relax. 

My friend ordered something and was informed within minutes that it wasn't available for that night. New business problems. Get it together. He then ordered a salmon Caesar salad. Pretty good, but nothing special. The piece of salmon wasn't particularly large. They originally served it with Ranch dressing. Simple mistake that was fixed quickly.

I ordered the crab, spinach, and artichoke  dip and the salmon bites. The salmon bites were more of a salmon salad that was fried. Easy to bite into and well seasoned. The crab dip came with freshly cooked pita chips. The chips were Great, the right taste and texture, being chewy and not too crunchy. The dip however lacked in crab meat. I think it was $8, so you get what you pay for. I think there was a healthy amount of crab flavoring in there as opposed to actual meat. That being said, the dip was still tasty. And because there was a significant delay in my food being served, the manager comped my meal. I didn't have to ask or complain. She was just on top of her game and noticed that I Still wasn't eating after 30+ minutes. Excellent customer service points there.

This same night, I came back with my girls because they were hungry after a long night. It was probably 1:45 and the kitchen was already closed. However, the owner offered to fix us some wings. We didn't take him up on the offer, but the gesture was very nice. He invited us to come back and handled the situation well. Great experience. This restaurant will be around for a long time to come.

Having not heard of this place, I was impressed that they were already so busy. Excellent place to come and kick it on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Thanks to 7th District for giving me and my friends a great lunch experience. The decor is beautiful and the food is good and well-priced. 6 of us came in a Saturday afternoon for lunch and we're well accommodated and taken care of. Really appreciate the staff for honoring my friend with a free birthday dessert. I've since returned for lunch and was equally pleased with speedy lunch service. I'll definitely return soon."}
{"text":"First time visiting on a Friday for my friends birthday. It was ladies night with a live Dj. I had grits and salmon, It was awesome. The 7th breeze drink was great."}
{"text":"Good food and great music.  Went with a friend Saturday night and the Dj was great.  I had the chicken and original waffle and it was perfection.  My friend had whiting and grits.  Her's was great as well.  Wish they had more of a drink selection.  They were only okay.  Would recommend you check this gem out and there's free parking"}
{"text":"Ok the server was excellent. Overall the food was ok and the atmosphere was ok as well. We have the Cajun pasta we also have the crab legs and I both were OK with could've made better dishes at  home. I was expecting so much more from this being a seafood restaurant. We were the only two in the restaurant on a Monday evening in downtown Charlotte. This being a premier location in the heart of everything especially uptown we were not impressed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience. My friend and I decided we wanted to get something to eat. I ended up choosing the shrimp and waffle fries and she had the fish and grits. Everything was seasoned well. I will be going back because I was told the crab legs were half on Monday!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at this Restaurent lounge. My first time was not a great experience because of their customer recovery we decided to try them again. It was almost a year now since the first time that we went. So, I know that they don't remember us. 

The second time, they had it right. The service was wonderful. I'm from the Lowcountry and I felt a lowcountry vibe. The food was great and they played great music. Great for date night. Just what we were looking for a place to lounge, eat well, and be around good people, thank you 7th district for getting it right and we will be back."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place. 7th district has always made me feel welcomed and I will continue to go.    

Only reason not five stars for me is I have not tried too much of the food and prices are high

All I know is tue-thur night is its drink special nights and I believe Mon. is its Crab leg night."}
{"text":"Last night a friend & I decided to come here for our birthday dinner. The location is great and they do have a good amount of parking plus there's a lot of street parking near by. As I entered I was greeted & sat immediately by the hostess and shorty after the waitress came and brought me water & asked if I needed anything else while I waited. Once my friend arrived our waitress returned to get her drink order. We decided to get the Crab Balls as an appetizer and they were great, we even got a second order. For our entrees she ordered the Shrimp & Grits with a side order or Mac & Cheese and I ordered the Salmon & Grits with a side order of Brussels sprouts. Unfortunately we were both pretty disappointed but we only sent back the Mac & Cheese which we didn't like at all. We also didn't like the grits which to me had like a milky/creamy yet grainy texture to them and no flavor not even with the teriyaki sauce that was on mine could do it justice so I just ate the salmon which was pretty good. And she just ate the shrimp out of hers. The brussel sprouts were alright but I enjoyed them the most after the crab balls. When our waiter came to clear the plates she asked us if we liked it and we were honesty and she thanked us for the feedback. A few minutes later she surprised us with a piece of chocolate cake for our birthday which was pretty good. Overall the service was great and I would go back but I wouldn't recommend any of the entrees that came with grits in my opinion."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great !!! Dj played great music, and went with the crowd. Waiter was great! Hookah was fun and i enjoyed my first time . While the food was good and fresh, menu was limited and food was high priced. I will return and it's a good chill spot ."}
{"text":"I came for Sunday brunch. We intentionally ordered two separate things so we could share. We chose the steak and eggs, salmon patties and Grits, and waffles (red velvet and vanilla). Everything came out looking great! The red velvet waffles are served with a citrus cream cheese icing. It's a great compliment to the dish. The atmosphere is nice and sexy. I will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"HOW ON EARTH DO YOU MESS UP A WAFFLE?!?!? I never thought the day would come, where I would taste a waffle that I didn't like. And not only did I not like it, it was so displeasing it was inedible. I asked for it to be extra crispy, it was soft as a pillow. The chicken tasted like it had been cooked in burnt grease. This plate was a disaster. Actually not a single person at our table enjoyed their food. The Salmon Bites tasted like they took canned shredded Salmon(SHREDDED!!), balled it, breaded it, fried it with no seasoning. We all left hungry. We also all left still waiting on a drink we ordered as soon as we'd arrived that never made it to our table. The waitress brought us our checks without the drinks on it and said if the bartender still makes them before you leave, i'll bring them over to you for free. Did not believe for a second that the bartender was still working on our drinks. Especially when we saw people at the bar getting drinks pretty quickly. How do you prepare bar drinks before your diners? Doesn't make sense to me. Horrible experience, will never return for any reason."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to 7th District.  I went solo this go around for some me time and brunch.  I had their salmon and grits with french toast last time and I wanted the same meal.  I was seated immediately and I ordered an Amaretto and Orange Juice.  They were out of Amaretto.  That was disappointing, but I can understand that they may have sold out from the night before.  My food arrived.  The salmon was grits looked perfect, but the french toast did not look like it was cooked thoroughly.  Even the server mentioned to me that it didn't look right to her but the cook said to bring it out anyway.  I sent it back and when it was brought back out, it still looked uncooked.

Issue #1 - the french toast being undercooked.  French toast is something that is SO basic, so to screw it up TWICE is unacceptable.

Issue #2 - I'm fairly certain that the Owner or Manager could not have been present or have been made aware of this because there was no concession.  There was no apology or an offer of something else.

I wont say that I'll never go back because their salmon and grits is really good!  And so is their french toast (when it's actually cooked all the way)."}
{"text":"A friend and i stopped in here before we went out saturday night. I heard alot about this place, their instagram page has you really excited about coming here although it was good it wasn't great. Nothing that i expected it to be from the food to the inside. More like a fancy bar setting. The menu and food was very basic,i just really thought this place would be more than what it was. I love to support my people so i would definetly revisit and try something different. Our drinks were a little watered down as well i really want to love this place so im going to give it one more go."}
