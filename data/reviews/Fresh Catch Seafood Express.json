{"text":"I really like this place.
A friend introduced me to this place and I tried the Salmon burger. I can safely say it is the best Salmon burger that I've had so far.
I go there every other week now and have the salmon burger. I work close by so I just call in to place and order and just go and collect it in ten minutes.
The staff is very friendly. I don't like how the place is set up, wall paint etc, but hey I go there for good food and that't what I get."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant, just opened. My coworker told me about this place as she frequents their other location on the east side somewhere. This is a soul food, seafood restaurant. They use fresh fish here, which is proudly on display in a glass cooler. I loved this, no mystery as to what you're about to eat. Now this is a tiny location, couple of little bistro tables to sit at. I would definitely say this is a take out destination though. 

So I tried a bunch of menu items because I opted to share with people. Almost everything on the menu is $6 at lunch. It includes fries, cole slaw and two slices of bread. I tried the 4 piece chicken wings, the ocean perch (2pc at lunch), the catfish and the breaded shrimp. I even went back for the mahi mahi taco's. Two flour tortilla taco's with pico, slaw, some fries and taco sauce. This was great, probably my favorite menu item thus far. Everything was good though, some things better than others. My favorites were probably the shrimp, the taco's and the catfish. They use this great seasoning on everything (I beleive), the fries and meat included. It really added a lot to the fries and made them super yummy. The cole slaw was declicious. I like how they include a side of hot sauce in every order. Just make sure to ask for ketchup and tartar sauce packets because those don't come in the box. The cocktail sauce was doctored up and it was really special. All in all, great location, great staff and food. A+"}
{"text":"I work downtown and eat here when I have a craving for fish, yet don't want to spend a ton of money. For the price, you do get your money's worth in food. I recommend the 2 piece fish lunch, or the fish po' boy. The fish is battered and seasoned well. You get a TON of fries and the seasoning they season their fries with is very good as well. There isn't many places downtown where you can get a very filling lunch for under 10 bucks, but I've never spent more than 6 dollars here, and always get a delicious surprisingly large meal for not a lot of money. If you like fish, but don't want to spend a fortune, try Fresh Catch! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went in around 10:30am.  The food was made quickly although there were no sides ready 1/2 hr after opening. We got the 5 shrimp, 2 fish, fries and coleslaw special. The food was fried nicely although putting the same seasoning on the fish, shrimp and fries made everything kinda taste the same. If I ever eat here again I would get the fish seasoned normally and the fries with just plain old salt. Not a bad lunch spot but not a great one either."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see Fresh Catch opened a downtown location. The service is fast and the cook always has a smile and something nice to say. The fish is always fresh and fries are hot. They could ease up on the seasoning some days but it doesn't stop me from returning. Great spot to grab lunch and if you call in, your food usually doesn't take more than 15 minutes. Definitely a go to for lunch. One downside is that there's no parking, so put on your walking shoes."}
{"text":"This should not be downtown. They take too long for an order and have inconsistent availability of their menu. Waited 35 minutes for our call ahead order, which was stated to only take 15. After waiting all that time, I was told part of my order wasn't available today, though I'd already paid for it. Also, while waiting, you're subjected to a loud tv showing tv shows with nudity and cursing. Definitely not what I think is appropriate for the work crowd in a downtown office building."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Fresh Catch last week for lunch.  It's very close to my work, so I can go often.  I was hoping for a good selection of fish and chips and Fresh Catch offers it.  They have at least four kinds of fish that you can order.  I asked the cashier what kind of fish she recommended and she said, \"Catfish\".  So catfish I ate...along with some seasoned french fries.  I think they use the same seasoning on the fries that they use on the fish.  I also received two pieces of bread and tiny side of cole slaw, which was creamy and yummy.  I found myself wanting more fish instead of two pieces of bread.  The fish was fresh and delicious with just the right amount of seasoning.  I can't wait to taste their other fish dishes for lunch soon.  I will probably call ahead next time.

It's hard to find the entrance if you've never been here, but the door faces Superior Avenue and is near the Pho Thang entrance."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelper Sam B and I were both feeling kind of blah one day last week, and decided to get some really good, greasy food to cure what ailed us (raging hangovers). We both work across the street from this place, and walked over to check it out for lunch. 

After my first visit, I have to say I was really disappointed...in myself and my total lack of willpower. 

I wish I never opened that delicious Pandora's Box! I generally try to eat my veggies for lunch, but now that I know that Fresh Catch is so close and so delicious, I foresee many more lunches full of eating my greasy feelings in the near future...

I have been a couple times now, and have opted for the catfish lunch ($6) on both visits. It is by far the best fried catfish I've ever tasted! It is perfectly seasoned and crispy and light. It is only enhanced by the little side of hot sauce they throw in. The fries and slaw are really delicious, too. 

The employees are all very friendly and upbeat, even when the place is totally crowded and chaotic."}
