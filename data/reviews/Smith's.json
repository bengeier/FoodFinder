{"text":"I LOVE THIS STORE! It got a bit busy for a while as two other stores in the area had closed. One has reopened and I am excited to have my quiet neighborhood store back. Never more than 2 people at a check stand. Always in stock. Helpful associates throughout the store. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This is a great Smith's location 
MOST of the cashiers and staff are friendly and extremely helpful - there are a few who are not 
Customer service is excellent at this location and they will help you in any way that they can 
The only downfall as others have said is the kids at each door fundraising or selling something"}
{"text":"Great service! The staff is always helpful, always fresh veggies! Nothing but smiles when I walk in"}
{"text":"24 hour is a huge plus. This is my local grocery store and it works out well. Decent produce, good prices on basics. Renovation is nice and added needed lighting."}
{"text":"What can I say? Smiths is my standard go to grocery store. They pretty much have most of what I need and at a reasonable price. The store is clean and organized. I can find what I need quickly. The employees are friendly and helpful. I accidentally dropped some cash there one day and an awesome employee returned it to me safely. This is definitely the store I would recommend for your day in and day out necessities!"}
{"text":"I walk to this store everyday and love it. Sure it is not the largest or most equip Smiths but ranking a generally 5 star supermarket low because it is not the best example is giving a unfair opinion

Smiths generally are much cheaper than others (esp the Albertsons across the road), and in a year of going everyday I can't honestly recall the people other reviewers have complained about.  But lets be honest, it is a supermarket not a service industry, you go there for groceries and Smiths has some of the best prices and sales available in Las Vegas.

In addition this Smiths is in a well to do area (which is why it is surprising it is smaller and does not have as large a variety as others), so a nice bonus if your single is the pool of wealthier better looking healthier people who shop there.  Did I mention i go there everyday????"}
{"text":"Things always seem to be highly unorganized. I went to the store and the entire baby section was under construction. I found where the baby stuff was put temporarily. When I asked an associate if I could purchase these items I was told, \"no they aren't put in yet.\" I walked away. The associates proceeded to make comments and talk about the situation. Extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"Don't know why it says closed, came for my rib eyes 4.49 a lb, luv when they have sales on ny or rib eyes steaks . The beef is choice grade maybe not on par w/ John mulls or costco but for the price, can't beat it . I also like  the seafood counter better then albertsons, for some reason all the albertsons fish counters smell."}
{"text":"Parking is very scarce normally - and I've actually had an old man BACK UP into my car mirror while being stationary in a parking space - all of which has very little to do with the actual shopping experience inside.  Friendly staff normally - lines are reasonably handled - rather easy to find stuff.   Cheaper vons , still pretty packed though."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff sometimes the have wines tasting with a friendly and knowledge staff 
I use to shop at  others store now I'm a smiths costumer ....
Thanks"}
{"text":"The only reason I come here is because this is the only place that stocks my pets' food at a lower price. The deals aren't that amazing, and I have yet to see any perks come from their rewards card. Their customer service doesn't stand out at all either.
What has driven me to write review, however, is the constant presence of children usually waiting to ambush you right in front of the store. You know, I get it, and I appreciate their enthusiasm, but it's dangerous. Obviously, the staff at this store don't see this as a safety concern because I've encountered this issue about every other week for the past year. One time, tiny elementary school kids were running through the parking lot approaching every person they could find, sometimes right in the middle of parking traffic at night. This is a busy shopping center, I would hate for any of these kids to get hurt.
This store really needs to take care of this issue. If not, contact the owners of the lot! The kids don't know what kind of dangerous people are lurking in these neighborhoods and drivers can be distracted at any moment. Fix this please."}
{"text":"Karen was the worse pharmacist I've ever felt with she told me at 5:30 it's now 5:50 and I'm told she can't fill my medication because she didn't manage her time well.  I'm a father who needs his medication filled I am shopping with my baby and this lady is to old to be working she is talking to people and not filling prescriptions very very disappointing"}
{"text":"if i could give a 0 star i would...

so my husband and i decided to try the Clicklist function of order online and pick up groceries curbside. we arrived at 7:01 pm and watched for well over 10 minutes through the glass at the associate that was manning the station took cell phone calls, cut paper with scissors, took a selfie and what not before my husband went into the store proper to ask about getting our order. well after a minute after returning to the car after talking to customer service we decided to film said associate. she took another call and what not and we have well over 4 minutes of footage of her doing nothing. at this point we hit the 20 minute mark of waiting and my husband went back into the store where he was met by the cs employee and the manager. they called the associate up and she admired she'd taken some calls and told us we should have called her to let her know we were there. the websites specifically states to stay in your car as they come out to you and no phone number or instructions to call are issued in the confirming email i received. the manager didn't even apologize for her employee or try to make amends just assured my husband our card hadn't been charged as of yet so we canceled the order. we went to the smiths on sahara and nellis our normal store which doesn't have the Clicklist feature. i told them what happened and they gave us the office number to the area and we will be calling them as well as submitting screen shots of my confirming email, my order confirmation number and the 4 plus minutes of video to their corporate email. 

good luck explaining the cell phone usage."}
{"text":"I do most of my shopping at Smith's.  They have everything I need.  They are usually stocked.  A few times when I noticed they were out of what I wanted in the produce section,  the employees always willingly go to the back and grab it for me!  

I never have to wait in line too long.  The employees always make sure the lines don't get too long.  

Great customer service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This is where I usually do all my grocery shopping. Their produce is usually fresh and their prices are decent. Sometimes I find things cheaper other places but I think that happens everywhere. Albertsons is across the street and I prefer Smiths just for the produce."}
{"text":"Love this place, my man in the seafood section is always a pleasure to do business with."}
{"text":"Just had the WORST customer service at this location, but it got 2 stars because the manager JAN was so apologetic and understanding of the situation. If you have an issue just call the store & ask to speak to Jan, she will definitely take care of it/speak to that rude associate."}
{"text":"When I checked out last week, the cashier asked if I found everything I was looking for; I replied no, that I had wanted to get some Swiss chard, found none, so settled for turnip greens.  She then got on her phone and requested the produce manager.  He went and checked if they had any Swiss chard, returned and told me no, but he would order some.  I also asked him to get some leeks.  He asked me if I looked for them in the organic section--I told him no, but I wanted the regular leeks and found none.  I went back yesterday and neither Swiss chard or leeks (none in the organic section or regular section) were there.
Last week I also bought some iceberg lettuce, though it was tough choosing one that didn't have brown gook at the cut end--I mentioned this to the cashier too.  My summertime favorite, peaches, were omitted from my shopping list after buying a bag there which cost me nearly $10.  After eating two which were bland and pithy, I made them into a pie, and with the addition of sugar and lemon juice they were rescued. But I'm not going to make the mistake of buying them here again"}
{"text":"Great service, workers are all friendly and helpful. They have great sale prices and the app is very helpful. It remembers what you buy and shows you weekly coupons and sales on those items. They have a great variety of products and it's always a good experience coming here."}
{"text":"This is by far the dirtiest store I have ever been in, dirty diapers on the ground in the parking lot and inside the store isn't much better!! Staff is more interested in socializing than helping customers and the cart boy is more interested in his cell phone than he is getting carts."}
{"text":"The store it's clean , the employees are fairly nice they have Great Deals they have awesome sales usually they have everything in stock I don't have to worry about getting your rain check very often.

But this is an open letter to the manager or to the front end manager or whoever handles the cash registers and then Lanes with the great gals that check out my groceries.

I really hate that you call some other working person up to the register to check out my groceries when there's one person in front of me I can stand there for 20 seconds or even 30 maybe even a minute , I feel so bad that when I come up to the register those girls want to call a guy or a gal from the back to come check out my groceries because he's not already busy stocking shelves cleaning and doing whatever you do in the back room. Not to mention that I have to stand at the new open Lane while I wait for somebody to come up to check out my groceries when I could have already had my stuff on the lane that I was standing in.

I am now refusing to change lanes today the guy in front of me had three items I could have had all my stuff on the Belt but the girl said there's a guy coming up to go over to lane xxxx and I waited and I waited and he didn't show up and I had my stuff all on the belt in the lane I was in before the guy even showed up and he didn't even know what Lane to go to.

I understand you think you're doing me a service by calling a person up to wait on me but honestly the 30 seconds I wait in line it's time for me to reflect make sure I have everything I need and gives me just a few seconds to relax.

And to that end please please tell your Checkers don't be rude to me because I won't move. The gal that handles the front end in the dark hair she needs an attitude adjustment. The last time I refused to move she gave me a dirty look, she made a rude comment and went on her way. And the reason I refused to move...several weeks ago I had a huge cart full of stuff she said to me I'll take you down to one of the self-checkouts and do your groceries myself only after three items...
somebody came and asked her for help and I ended up doing that whole basket by myself. What I should have done was loaded it all back in my cart and went down to an aisle.

If it's three or five deep I can see you calling somebody for help but the fact that there's only two of us inline is no reason to interrupt up somebody else's day to come check my groceries out and make it very awkward and annoying.

It's okay, I can wait!"}
{"text":"Always great prices at this grocery store! Great place to get produce.  And their sales are awesome! I like to wait for their newspaper ad in the mail to see the sales before making my trip so I don't miss anything.  =) Especially those 10 for 10 specials or even better when you wanna buy by the bulk, sometimes they have \"case sales\".  I always use their bakery to order my kids cakes for birthday parties or normally I like to buy their random cakes for random occasions too.  This particular location have very nice customer service & always well stocked.  Very clean too! If you plan on going to this store, PLEASE get the Smith's card! Can't miss out on ADDITIONAL discounts.  One of my favorite grocery stores in Henderson."}
{"text":"I like the fair quality of the food and what you get for the prices paid. Each Smith's store has a slightly different layout which can be a challenge when you think you know where something is and it is in a different spot. The service is the best part, especially at the Maryland Parkway location. They are always helpful and friendly and honestly it is why I go there more than any other grocery store (even other Smith's locations)."}
{"text":"The pharmacy staff is amazing. The get your prescription filled while you wait. The pharmacist is super friendly and seems to remember me and my husband as well as the meds we take and our conditions. She has also has helped push medications thru my insurance company.
I would drive across town to go to this pharmacy"}
{"text":"I purchased my daughter's birthday cake (white cake with strawberry filling and whipped cream frosting) from here and was very pleased. I ordered the cake a week in advance in which the woman who took the order was very polite and suggestive. I have ordered cakes from many bakeries including the higher end ones for my kids parties and I've never received so many compliments on how good this one was."}
{"text":"I had a problem with an overcharge on a receipt and after encountering Mustafah's unprofessionilism in handling situations, I no longer wish to shop there.  I spoke to the store manager; however, Im unsure if he corrected the problem of his employee's egotistical attitude."}
{"text":"I go to this smiths because it is the closest supermarket to my house. There is an Albertson's that is across the street from the Smith's, but I prefer Smith's.

First of all, Smith's is open 24/7. That's great if I need some late night munchies or commodities such as toilet paper. Second, they have self checkout registers. I feel weird getting checked out by an employee, it seems as if I should be tipping them or something.

If you have a shoppers card, you can save a lot of money on certain items that are discounted. And, if you use your card, you can redeem points towards gas discounts, which really isn't that great because the discount is at Shell stations, which charge a lot more than most gas stations.

I will continue to shop here because it's convenient. The prices aren't that bad either, it's better than Albertsons. I think the prices are better than Vons too."}
{"text":"This is a horrible location. Staff are rude and unprofessional. The store itself is dirty and disorganized. There are better Smith's nearby and a decent Albertson's across the street. I won't shop here again."}
{"text":"Have a great selection on fresh meat and seafood. The produce has regular and organic choices. They have a friendly and helpful staff. The self checkout is a plus. I have the rewards card, which helps some on fuel discounts. Free items on Fridays is not bad either."}
{"text":"Not as good Kroger. Not as friendly as Kroger but the prices are nice. I would probably come back."}
{"text":"I shopped here yesterday (Saturday, 6-30-2017) after a visit to the VA clinic just south on Boulder Highway.  My experience was truly blessed and memorable...because of the nice young lady, Jesse, who I was so lucky to have as my cashier.  What a warm, beautiful smile and disposition she has.  If there hadn't been people waiting behind me, I think I could have spent the rest of the day talking with her.  Smith's is so very fortunate to have friendly employees such as Jesse.  I left the store with a very wonderful feeling.  I just love good people like Jesse, who make my world so much more enjoyable.  Thank you, Jesse."}
{"text":"Every year I get a gift card for Smith's so I popped in hear to spend it.  This location is big and busy.  With all that I was still able to get what I needed and was out quickly.  Price wise...I can find cheaper deals at other stores."}
{"text":"What can be said about this company that hasn't been said already...Its great! Its parent compant Kroger sees to that..I'm from Los Angeles of course everyone knows that is from there the stores are either. Food 4 Less or Ralphs but what ever name is used they are still part of the Ktoger family.they all have low competitive prices fresh produce great seafood and you can. even get your perscription filled
 at the pharmacy.Smiths get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Smiths is pretty equal throughout, with customer service. 

One of my favorite supermarkets to shop at. They have a great seasonal section, every season!

The layout of the store is pretty similar to every other Smiths! 

The customer service is always top notch! The employees seem to be hard working! 

I love shopping at this store, & will continue to shop there!"}
{"text":"I love going grocery shopping. I love exploring.

I have always been treated friendly there, whether it be by the meat department, cashiers, and there is a tattoo'd associate in the produce, who is always very friendly, and speaks to everyone he sees.

Their breads they make in store are delicious. The three cheese bread is my family's favorite. They are even starting to carry sushi, which are yummy as well. I also see that they carry some special items, like Cayman Jack and large single blue moon/shock top beers (perfect for when I make beer battered fish/onion rings)

The remodeled store is beautiful. But the parking lot is terrible, because Smith's is always, always bumpin'! 

And I love smith's because I save on gas at shell! Today, I saved .60 cents a gallon, and paid 2.91 for gas, and they give you that discount up to a dollar! They make it really easy for you to save money, especially now when you can load digital coupons onto your shoppers card online! I had a steal today on Kraft shredded cheese (making pizza tomorrow) it was on sale, and then I had an additional .50 cents off.

The only thing that I don't buy there is body products/shampoos/baby/detergent.
That I save for Sally beauty supply, [in the same parking lot] or Target, or if I am feeling brave, Walmart. Because they are just too pricey."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience At this smiths. I came in late at night around 10:30 after working all day and taking care of kids, and I'm 3 months pregnant! I had a full cart of groceries worth $200 and there were no lanes open so I nicely asked these two men standing around talking if they could help me check out and they very rudely told me I could only do self checkout. So I had to take 30 min to self checkout and wait for the attendant 5 times. I noticed when leaving atleast 5 employees just standing around, it's a shame that no one cared enough to help me. I will not be coming back to this smiths ever."}
{"text":"Went into this smiths for the first time, as I had just moved over to this side of town. I just finished dinner and wanted to grab a couple things. I wasn't sure what time they closed, but knew that most Smith's were 24 hours. As I am getting the things I need, an announcement comes across the store and says \"we will be closing in 7 minutes\". I said to myself well I guess they close at midnight and proceeded to turn down another isle to find rice real quick. As I turn down the isle, an associate looks at me and says \"we are closing in like 2 minutes\". I thought to myself how rude. They just made an announcement and it's not past close.  I felt so rushed that I didn't even want to look to see  where the bread isle was or get bread. By  the time I got to the register it was 3 minutes until close and the associates were just giving the most hateful glares. This was my first and last time in that smiths. Today I went to Albertsons and got  the bread that I wasn't able to get because I was so rudely rushed out of the store and was informed that they won't even say anything to employees that are in the store shopping even after close.  There was absolutely no reason for that employee to say that to me less than A minutes after the announcement was just made!  I do not make it a common occurrence to patronize establishments right at close, but like I said I was new to this area and I had just finished dinner right next door.  I will not be back to this smiths and I definitely think they should learn how to treat paying customers!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. Not that it was so wonderful before. If you like to play bumper carts with angry people, this place is awesome! It used to be somewhat cleaner inside. The produce has also seemed to diminish quality. 

I like that they have free fruit for kids while you shop, more stores should follow that one. 

The customer service is also awesome and employees are great. Once I had another customer walk out with all my groceries and the store was very helpful and kind about the whole thing. 

Beware of the parking lot as well, very crowded and people aren't always paying attention."}
{"text":"Pharmacy really closes for lunch on a Saturday? Lamest thing I've ever heard. Get more staff on hand! Worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"Still find this store very clean and well stocked in comparison to local other stores. Cashiers have been kind and quick at ringing you up. They all seem to make polite conversation and willing to tell you about a sale or two. 
I enjoy the fuel rewards. Every $100 spent you get .10 off gas up to $1 off (up to 30 gallons) just use your telephone number every time you check out or when picking up prescriptions. Your RX will get you 50 points per script! Hey every penny adds up right??
Pharmacy for being well staffed is a bit slow and never seem to have enough people to ring you up (and yes you have to pay for it there). They do have a walk up window outside but honestly easier to come in. 
Milk and eggs are less here then the local Walmart and no Walmart won't price match the  ad. Digital coupons and sales can be uploaded on your smartphone by using their app. Sounds silly but it's added up to a lot of savings"}
{"text":"I always shop at Smith's, but there is one closer to my house. This store is just down the street from my work, though, so I thought I would head in and grab lunch after I made a deposit at the bank inside. 

I stood at the deli counter (which was mediocre at best to begin with) for at least 5 minutes. While I was there, patiently waiting, I noticed another patron waiting. The old man was very frustrated and eventually stormed off warning me if I wanted to eat I should go somewhere else. There were 2 people working behind the deli, NEITHER of them were serving customers! I waited another 5 minutes, had made eye contact with both people behind the counter, and STILL received no service. 

I eventually left, like the old man, and informed the people approaching the deli that they are slow behind the counter. I have never eaten there, and will never try again. There is no reason to not serve your customers! I didn't even get a \"hello\" or \"be right with you\". NOTHING. 

I've worked at a service deli before, and their customer service here is atrocious!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Smiths I've been to. No bulk coffee & only 3 small shelves of ground coffee with only two flavored. Hard to find the Naked Juice area. Staff not very helpful."}
{"text":"It's a Smith's. Pretty standard chain grocery store. This location is somewhat (like just a little bit) nicer than the other ones in my 'hood. It's open 24 hrs, but they close / block the north entrance at 9:00pm. And it's pretty much just self-checkout after 9:00pm. (Could those self-checkout bagging areas get any more sensitive?! Drives me crazy with all the place / remove beeping messages!) They offer the same things as every other Smith's and pretty much every other grocery store. The produce is alright, but not great. My fav things here are that they carry Graeter's and Blue Bell ice cream."}
{"text":"I have shopped at this store for years. The staff is amazing but more recently the location is not as safe. I often do not feel safe shopping at night if I have many groceries to load and my husband will accompany me to make sure I am safe. It has better prices and vale than nearby competitors but I suggest not shopping alone at night."}
{"text":"We thought that this would've been a nice store, it seems huge from the outside and it is huge on the inside, unfortunately one entrance was open and it was broad daylight.  They are taking out the one-hour photo lab.  They weren't opening new checkstands.  The store seemed to be out of stock, way out of stock with so many items missing from each aisle.  Most other Smith's are very nice, what happened here?"}
{"text":"Johnny, the frozen manager made a great recommendation on Fat boy ice cream sandwiches. He was so friendly and had great customer service I had to rave about him."}
{"text":"produce is always wilted and recently bought kale got home and discovered it was covered in bugs!  brought it back and manager didn't seem to care just gave me my money back on a giftcard."}
{"text":"I don't know if they have these at other Smith's, but the Banana Split donut they have here as the Donut of the Month for June is like the most decadent donut in the history of donuts. About 8000 calories but totally worth it. 

Have to -1 though as Smith's still seems to think that you can just bake white bread in a circle and call it a bagel."}
{"text":"Smith's at Flamingo and Ft. Apache has really stepped up the selection. Plus this store has a great vibe. I walked in an the greeter said \"Woah! You have boba tea! Awesome!\" and many friendly people followed, from the girl in the deli who gave me some great recs on Boar's Head deli meats and cheeses to my cashier who reminded me I completely forgot to grab the Red Bull I wanted, to the bag boy who offered to help me to my car.  

There were some super deals this weekend and I'm so pleased that I didn't miss out. Smith's has really expanded healthy and organic options and they reduced the prices across the board on all of their produces. I use their app, so I get digital coupons and free stuff every Friday. If you don't currently use the mobile app, I highly recommend.

This store is a little closer to Summerlin and the cleanliness, friendliness and selection seems to be a step above the other nearby locations. I think it will be worth it to drive an extra couple of miles and patronize this location from now on. Five stars and a big thank you!"}
{"text":"The bakery team at this location is awesome. I drive past several grocery stores to order from these guys. It's on time and correct every time."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Clean store - very clean! Convenient parking lot and location - busy but not congested and you're in and out. Awesome pharmacy staff. Nicely stocked produce department. They could use more gluten and dairy free items."}
{"text":"You may think its weird to read up on a shopping center on yelp but this young lady at you-scan really changed my experience around about a week back. Went in looking for frozen crepes and 2 people ((one checker one bagger)) said to me when I asked if they new where the were \"nope, we don't carry them.any more. & no sorry. No idea. \" instead of taking 5 min out of their day to use there tools around them to help me out they said no. :/ no good. So.I figured I'd try asking one last person! She was very sweet and helpful!! She used her little computer to look up all items similar to the frozen crepes I was hunting for and lone behold she found them for me! Wasnt even hard!!! So I am giving 3 stars only for the sweet heart at yiu-scan who took 5 min out of her day to help me. The other two -2 stars because they are no bueno. Haha. 

I'll be back of course smiths quality is always good was just kind of sad about the 2 employees."}
{"text":"Overall a good, solid grocery store; organic selection can be a little lacking, especially with the quality of organic apples. This Smith's isn't as large as the store in Green Valley and lacks an olive bar/lunch bar like we enjoy at that store. Checkout has always been quick, and employees have always been very helpful. Clientele can be a little rough around the edges which is primarily why we opt for the Green Valley location though we live much closer to this one."}
{"text":"This is my regular stop, no matter what time of day. Most of my friends work here, so it's always nice to be able to pop in and see the special deals of the day. It's always clean, and service is top. Come in late at night for the cheap stuff."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this store the organic vegs. Are amazing better yet the prices are very reasonable cheaper then whole foods. The workers are very nice and helpful the store is very clean I highly recommend this store to any one."}
{"text":"The customer service here is terrible! After getting home and looking at my receipt I realized the cashier shorted me $20. Probably because she was too busy complaining to the guy behind me about being transferred to this store. I called immediately and was placed on hold for a bit while the manager was contacted. He never came to the phone so I had to leave my name and number. I was told he would need to count the till and he would get back to me the same day. He never called me back and when I called the next day I was told he wasn't there and they have no idea so I would need to call when he's there, but she doesn't know his schedule. I shouldn't have to keep calling when it wasn't my mistake the manager should have been on top of this. Unprofessional and unorganized customer service."}
{"text":"I love Smiths, i find the prices to be better than that of Albertsons and Vons, plus the gas point don't hurt either! This store is usually clean and stays open late if not i think 24hrs? I work 3rd shift so i do my grocery shopping at weird times. The meat is always great but i recommend getting day of, I have gotten a big pack before and froze some for like a month but it went bad when i would thaw it the night before, so I don't know what happened there. The chicken has never been a problem. I get kroger brand cereal, just so much cheaper than named brand and tastes the same. Anyway keep it up!"}
{"text":"Another good Smith's, we are really spoiled here having a large selection of 24 hour grocery stores & this being one of them. I pop by here when i'm in the area and need to get some shopping done. I have yet to have a negative experience with this place. The staff as always been polite and helpful, they keep a watchful eye on the crowds and are pretty prompt in opening up additional check stands during a rush."}
{"text":"I really love smiths so it breaks my heart that I have to give this store such a bad review but here is what happened. I went shopping to pick up a few things and there was something spilled on the floor, instead of cleaning it up one of the employees put a wet floor sign on top of it, well in the middle of the spill but it was a big spill. Obviously I didn't see the sign until after I fell, mind you I'm 40 weeks pregnant and this could of ended disastrously. I escaped from the incident with some painful bruises but when I approached an employee to tell them about the incident never once did they apologize they just asked me where the spill was. I will never shop at this store again! Bad enough that I fell while pregnant but what if it had been an elderly person? this is unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Employees here are great. Last time I came I ended up throwing away about $15 worth of organic food that I didn't realize was spoiled when I purchased it. I was pretty irritated I called and complained. After the complaint I forgot about it. I guess I just wanted to be heard and the manager did a great job listening and offering to compensate.. well they more than made up for it the next time I went. Every employee I came in contact with was great! One was in the process of marking items down and stopped what he was doing and went in the back to get the gun to mark the product down, and it saved me $3 on a loaf of organic bread! He didn't have to do that, I was willing to pay $5.39 for it. He was happy to inconvenience himself. Overall I'm very happy with most of the Smith's locations I'm ecstatic about the increase of organic options and the fact that they are affordable. I am passionate about organic food and I tell people all the time to go to Smith's where organic food is Affordable. I am particularly happy with the dry bulk and it's organic options particularly at the Sunset and sunset location. Thank you Kroger keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Wow has this store went downhill!!!!  I dealt with one of the rudest most unprofessional so called managers I've ever encountered!  Her name is Janene!  I don't know how she keeps her job here!  I've spoke with several other employees from cashiers to the meat department and they all agree that she's extremely rude to customers as well as employees.  The appearance of the store on the outside is always full of garbage in the parking lot all the way up to the entrance.  Carts are always stacked up in piles everywhere.  I never can go in this store without some pan handler asking me for money in the parking lot.  Then when you go in the store....it's complete chaos!  The bathrooms are disgusting!  The floors throughout the store are disgusting! The meat section is a joke!  Prices are outrageous!  Their poultry brand is horrid!!!!  And do yourself a favor....DON'T go in this store when people get their welfare money!!!!  It's like walking around Tijuana!!!!  People will stalk you hoping you turn away for a moment so they can steal your purse!  This store needs SERIOUS SECURITY!  I feel so sorry for the elderly people that have to go here and shop.  We waited in line for 25 minutes to get some potato salad at the deli.  One guy looked very busy slicing meat and cheese and packaging it up.  I assumed he was waiting on a customer.  After he was done he brought about 15-20 packaged meats/cheeses over to a stand outside the deli counter!  WHILE there was at least 8 people in line waiting for service!  And there was  only one older guy helping customers this entire time! (Memorial Day)  And he was extremely slow.  Perhaps it was his first day?  I wasn't impressed with their produce either.  Tasteless fruit!  Rotten garlic, white onions & red peppers.  And the MAJORITY of the fruit and vegetables are marked clearly from MEXICO!!!  I guess Smith's can't afford to buy produce from the UNITED STATES?!!!  But they sure can charge high prices as if it was shipped in from Italy!  This store absolutely disgusts me.  They have a few cashiers like Robert....that should be running this place....or better yet....running out of this place!  And JANENE shouldn't have a job here!  According to other employees who have complained about her....it appears corporate ignores them.  Probably why they have such a huge turnover of employees!  All I can say is....SHOP ELSEWHERE....FOR YOUR OWN SAKE!!!!!"}

{"text":"i used to shop every few days at the walmart neighborhood market down the street on silverado ranch road, but i got sick and tired of not having a riding cart to use, even at 10:30 - 11 pm at night when i shop after work. and their aisles were hard to navigate because there are boxes in the middle of them for stocking the shelves. the last time i shopped there, i got so frustrated that i left the store and went to the first place i saw nearby: smith's.  there were three riding carts waiting for me, there were no cluttered aisles, the stock guy was friendly, the cashier was friendly, and once when i went during the day, there were plenty of riding carts and the bagger offered to help me to my car. there were no long lines like there are at walmart even if it's late at night, and it was cleaner and smelled better.  i don't like self-checkout and prefer to help support a cashier's pay but i don't enjoy waiting in a long line to do so.  with their rewards card and hitting their sales, the prices are just as good as walmart.  i haven't shopped at a walmart market since, and i probably won't in the future.  smith's has earned my loyalty."}
{"text":"Natalie at the meat counter is always a delight and Todd does a good job ordering items that are not typically carried (i.e. fresh Rhubarb). I was at Albertson's just up the street and was going to but two Salmon Filets for the BBQ recently, but unlike Smith's, they don't have skin-on filets (and cut to order, if you ask nicely).
I actually put down the items I was going to buy and went back to Smith's - where I know I can get what I want. I like that Smith's still sends me coupons for the things I buy the most, and that the cashiers are always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Shop here every week. Friendly help.  Love the Gas points, saves a bunch.
Thanks !"}
{"text":"We came in here to walk off our food coma from Sushi Mon, and this place is super huge and carries quite a variety of merchandise. We came before Christmas, so they had a section of items that would make pretty cool gifts like a hot pink Blu-Ray player for $60. There were some good deals too, like a bag of Clementine oranges for $3 with card. The employees I had encountered here were some of the friendliest in the grocery store business, so that alone, would be worth 4 stars."}
{"text":"This store has a good selection of items and has excellent specialty areas like meat, deli, floral, and bakery. They also have a nice seasonal section."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the lower quality Smith's in town.  The service is weak at checkout and the produce section is atrocious.  The one redeeming quality of the location is that it is by my house and they usually have decent specials on meat/seafood biweekly."}
{"text":"Deli is faster than most stores ive been to, and the self check out allows me to get in and out fast when i just need a few items."}
{"text":"This is a nighttime experience review. 

I'm the type of person who likes to get in and get out of the stores. If you're looking for little to no lines as well as little instore traffic, this is the right place. The prices are definitely better than most grocery stores as well. It also has self checkouts that are always open so you don't need a cashier. To top it all off, it's 24hrs. Very convenient!"}
{"text":"The grocery store that is a minute away...how I love thee....fried chicken!!! Smiths has there very own deli. We love there fried chicken...its cooked so perfectly. I gotta say it's better than KFC but nothing beats Popeye. Well, smiths chicken price is very reasonable.$ 7.99 for 2 pcs of each (breast, thigh, wing, and drumsticks). I went yesterday and for some reason I paid only $5.99 for 8 pc...dont know if it was a special but you can't go wrong. Better to go early sometimes they don't have much left but its a hit or miss. 

The grocery store itself is pretty good. Fruits and veggies are mostly fresh. Truth is they are cheaper than Albertson. 

Happy shopping everyone!"}
{"text":"They aren't open until 6am now! I have to go all the way to Walmart on Lake Mead and Boulder. Or wait till 6am. I used to like shopping late to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Specifically the deli in this location is terrible. Customer service is a joke. One novice trying to tread water and four Chiefs doing very little."}
{"text":"Most convenient place for us to shop because we live so close. My only complaint is that workers seem to disappear right when you need them at the self check out. I swear 9 times out of 10 when we use self check out and need to be carded or \"attendant has been notified\" they disappear and we are looking around for them. Other than that everyone is kind and helpful. Would also recommend the pharmacy for the great customer service we always receive."}
{"text":"The store itself is nice, easy to find everything I need, very nice cashier.  It pharmacy is horrible!! Not very helpful at all and they give you attitude."}
{"text":"The parking lot was packed but orderly. The store was clean and organized. Produce was fresh and priced reasonably. The selection of items on everything from cereal to tomato sauce was great as well.

There were a lot of sales and 10 for $10 items. The store rewards card which the cashier signed me up for cut down the prices as well.

The sales associates were very friendly and helpful. Some one was always available to answer questions or give quick  directions.

This is definitely going to be my go to grocery store. I've been to several other chains and Smith's by far has given me the most bang for my bucks. The great  customer service as well as the variety in products makes Smith's number 1 for me."}
{"text":"This smiths is close to my house and I usually only go when they have really good sales! No complaints! Usually always stocked with whatever I'm looking for and all though a bit more expensive than let's say wal mart or something I still resort to coming here for the smaller things and or for better quality meats!"}
{"text":"Deli, grocery, and customer service have always been very good. I even had a person from the bakery tell me to bring back any items that aren't to my satisfaction with freshness.  Management jumps on lines to help checkout.  Great job Smiths."}
{"text":"This location is busy! So my husband and I usually go really early in the morning when it isn't too crazy. It doesn't matter is its busy or not though because the checkers are always friendly. They take the time out to actually make conversation with you while they're moving 100 MPH. The store is very clean and the meats and produce are always very nice and fresh."}
{"text":"This place rocks! They have great customer service and prices. You can find whatever you need and not overpay."}
{"text":"I love this place. My grocery store back home was a Kroger which is this place's parent company. I feel at home here. Deli staff is awesome. Cashiers are amazing. Great deals."}
{"text":"It's a good store and the people are friendly. Good prices and sales.bbut why does it always stink like bleach by the meat . I know you gotta keep? it clean but it can be overwhelming"}
{"text":"Well if i ever moved to Vegas this would definitely be my go to store.....especially this location....because some of the other locations are not that great and don't have the selection this one does. Fry's Food Stores are the equivalent in AZ so they have exactly the same deals and quality products and that is why Smith's would be my grocery store of choice here in Vegas. One huge issue with grocery stores is that the don't always have or never seem to have those few particular items you really want. A couple of those examples are Sweet Chili Doritos (yes they are the only VEGAN Doritos that exist) and Grape Crush (because who doesn't like Grape Crush). Well we found both at this Smith's location and we were extremely excited. Now don't get me wrong we don't eat this kind of Junk Food often....even though it is VEGAN....but we would like to purchase these items from time to time but NO ONE ever has them. Smith's like Fry's also has Kale (Organic at that) for 98 cents a pound EVERYDAY.....no other store ANYWHERE can make that claim. Smith's Like Fry's also has the \"FRIDAY FREE ITEM\" and who doesn't like something for free? They are the only grocery store that has this promotion and  it has been in existence for YEARS now. 

I could go on and on.....but you get my drift.....you could shop at other grocery stores.....but why? Pay Smith's a visit and I promise you won't regret it.....Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The sidewalk and entry into this grocery store is filthy and has been for months.  They need to power wash or get a professional cleaning.  Nobody wants to walk through filth to buy food.  I uploaded some pictures of it.  See the photo section."}
{"text":"I am so honestly over the Smiths grocery store this is just one of the issues I've had at Smith's stores across Las Vegas are use the self check out tonight with about 10 items and six of them did not price right so a Manager had to go through each item individually priced it out right and fill out a little slip to explain the price to the store whatever and then when I finally get my receipt a price is still not right so I had to go see the manager who's name is Ida who's checking someone out with a ton of stuff and I asked her if I could just get the dollar that I was overcharged because it's not fair that I'm paying a price that isn't right for an item and she said I had to wait till she finally checked them out for a dollar she couldn't just give me the dollar she made me wait until she had completely checked out these people with tons of stuff while my items in the meantime are getting warm and defrosting! And she was incredibly rude didn't care that I had just had to deal with all of this crap because they don't know how to put in proper self checkout systems! Don't even get me started on the fact that the store was stocking everywhere at 9:30 pm so you couldn't even get to things! This location and the location on Tropicana and jones have really let me down with customer service. I went there once and had a big event so had a lot of groceries $275 worth. They wouldn't open a checkout lane so I had to do self checkout. Had nowhere to put the groceries and I couldn't put the already bagged ones in the cart so they piled up. These self checkouts are ruining everything and killing the customer experience for me! They are a pain in the butt."}
{"text":"I like this store! They have a great selection of products and brands and the displays and shelving are always presentable and maintained. 75% of the employees I have come into contact with are very professional and friendly. The other 25% seem to be there just for the pay-check, I get it...being in customer service myself, I am put-off when the employee engages in conversations with co-workers versus taking care of their customer in which they are helping or hollering to other staff across the room. This particular morning, a male employee  in produce was exceptionally helpful with finding the ingredients I needed to make my autumn salad and Dell, the click and shop employee was great too.  The store is generally clean and it seems to be improving every time I return."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS SMITH'S ! I always come in contact with the manager, he has like brown hair & wears glasses, my receipt says his name is Alton. Well he is always so kind and always willing to help me or direct me to another lane & call someone over to assist me! 

Today I checked out at 10 pm and he helped me though self check out too cause I had about 20 items or so, and I was dreading checking out then BAM he he comes like superman always helping his customers out! He deserves a raise always helping people out & that is what we like. 

There should be some more people like that. Willing to go out of their way. Thank you !"}
{"text":"Love the fact you listened to my recommendations. Having the carts on the right as you enter the store along with the hand sanitizer was a great improvement. The new Store Manager is making great progress. The store is looking better and better and the staff is great. The only things I hope to see change is, the produce department stay cleaner, have more bags out for produce (there's not enough places to obtain them and it gets crowded) the self check out machines become more user friendly and work and the store be stocked more often since, our area is growing rapidly. If you could make the coupons for items I always buy populate first on my app that would be amazing. Rather than having to scroll through so many coupons I don't need."}
{"text":"Friendly, quick, professional and helpful. My pharmacy from now on! My only regret is that I hadn't come here sooner to be honest!! Excellent pharmacy!!"}
{"text":"The service at this store seems to have been declining pretty steadily. They are routinely out of some of my normal items. Quite frequently they have out produce for sale that should've already been thrown away. I've caught pricing discrepancies (always ringing up more than marked) on multiple visits. Requiring a second trip to the store for a refund.  The final straw for me with this location was an incident Friday night.

 I was in the express lane. The woman in front of me had about triple the 15 item limit but whatever. She paid and was digging in her purse while the cashier started scanning my items. Then the customer picks a scab on her face(her face and arms are covered)&  it starts bleeding. The girl bagging asked the cashier if she had any napkins. She suggested the woman go to the restroom. She instead heads towards the parking lot. When I pay I get my few bags and notice one of my items is missing. It was the second thing rung up. I asked the bagger where it was. She told me I didn't buy the item. I showed her my receipt and told her she put it in the other woman's bag. She argued that the other woman bought it ( if that were true-where did mine go). She was rude and defensive. She went to go get it back from the woman. The cashier told me to go get another one. I did. When I got back the bagging clerk still never apologized and asked me why she had to go get the item from the woman if I got one from the shelf. I explained bc I paid for it & the other customer did not. . Also I don't want one that I know was touched by someone bleeding. I don't know if this is a scam she's running or what. I couldn't believe that she was never once apologetic. It wasn't a big deal until she was rude and had an attitude like I had given away something she spent money on.

 The close location isn't enough to make me come here again."}
{"text":"Nine times out of ten, this store is great. I just went through the line with a checker named Lida. She could not have been more rude. She never even said hi. She was chatting with the nagger and another checker. This was after she was finished chatting with another checker, making people wait in line. Lida is not a checker that I am familiar with but I would rather wait in a long line than go through hers again."}
{"text":"I like glaziers or even target for grocery studs however, I got a gift certificate from work for Christmas so I came here. Their produce was much better than I expected. Basic grocery items. Service was ok although I did do the self checkout.  I waited at customer service for a store card only to find out I had one. (that's how often I go). Prices were ok but I'll still stick to glaziers."}
{"text":"This Smith's is newly remodeled and awesome.  The prices are always very good at this store and I've never been treated better by a staff.  There is a Walmart close to here but it draws in the lower clientle and Smith's is left for hard working Henderson regulars.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Was a great store until they stopped being 24 hours. Those of us that work late depend on grocery stores to be open so we can get a few things before we head home. Now we will have to take our business to Walmart."}
{"text":"I like this Smith's. Staff is always available to help find items. The manager always stops what he's doing to say 'Hello'. Like the friendly guys at the Seafood counter and Deli also.."}
{"text":"My closest grocery retailer is this Smith's. I've been shopping here for 5 years for weekly groceries. On average I spend about $100-150 a week in this store. Today I realized I was running out of a few necessities and made a last minute trip Smith's. I gathered up my toddler daughter got her ready to go and rushed out the door so I can make it back in time for her bed time. I did my shopping at the store and approached the point of sale realizing I forgot my wallet in the rush to get out of the house. However, as someone who works with accounting and with numbers on a regular basis, I've memorized frequently used numbers like my Drivers License number, bank account, and my debit card. I asked the checker at the point of sale if I can speak with a supervisor regarding forgetting my wallet, so I can inform them that unfortunately I don't have my physical payment card here but I do know the card number and wanted to ask if they could do me a favor and manually enter my card for this transaction. The checker called the supervisor, who told me no, they don't have a way to manually enter a card. I informed the supervisor that I spent 5 years working Albertson's as a Front End Manager and I'm familiar with what they can and can't do at a POS. I asked her if she can get a store manager to ask, at this point she gets a radio and asks for Adam. Adam radio's back to her and says that he will not do that. I asked if I could speak with Adam, at this point the checkstand belt is still completely full of the groceries I picked out, and I'm struggling to keep my toddler entertained. About 10 minutes pass and Adam comes out, I explained the situation, I apologized that I didn't have the card on me, and that I do know the number. He explained that he is not allowed to key a credit card transaction. Then I asked, what do you do when the mag stripe doesn't read at the POS. He said they would key it in. Yet he still refused to help me complete my purchase, and stated he is not allowed to key in a card transaction.

So I am writing to explain why a store who has almost no competition in the area has lost me as a customer. The key ingredient to retaining a customer in your store is customer service. When a father with a toddler makes a last minute trip to the store before his daughters bed time, and is struggling with time and keeping his child from having a melt down in the store because the child is tired. The last thing he wants to hear is that the staff doesn't want to help him. I came to spend money, and today as I left the store without the groceries I picked out and a fussy toddler, I realized that if Smith's has no interest in taking a step out of the normal procedures to help me out of a bind."}
{"text":"Local grocery stores are pretty standard. This one is always clean and fully stocked. I think they usually have the best sales on steaks. 

The produce selection here is less expensive then vons or albertsons but you get what pay for. We usually do best when we shop for weekly groceries, anything over that and I end up tossing stuff in the trash.

The staff are always friendly and helpful. If there's a line at the registers they will quickly call someone up to open a new register.

{"text":"My family has been shopping at this Smith's for nearly 18 years. It is consistently one of the best supermarkets I have been in.

 It is not TJ's or Whole foods ( but those are different beasts all together!)

Perhaps it is the large size with the spacious isles that has me smitten with this place but they also have a really large selection of your typical Supermarket items.

Good Deli, Great selection of most every product. Their produce and vegetables are actually pretty good as well!

I feel this is almost like a costco as you can buy a lot of things in bulk here.

Help is really awesome as well.

Parking is great.....sorry I'm from San Francisco and parking is a blood sport."}
{"text":"Living in the Silverado Ranch area I usually shop at the Albertson's across the street for my essentials and I only use Chevron fuel in my car which is supported by the Albertson's/Vons fuel rewards. 

However, Smiths has a much better deli, Starbuck's DARK iced coffee and a selection of PRIME steaks.

As much as I love their deli, during the rush times, they seem understaffed and the wait time for meat and cheese orders can take up to 30 minutes.

This is my first supermarket Yelp review because one thing pushed me across the line tonight.

I went in to get chicken noodle soup from the soup bar. Figured they would have it in stock for dinner time. The soup bar was empty. I asked the deli clerk if they had any soup in back. I was told, \"They pull the soup at 3PM.' What? 3PM? 

I am confused. Are they saying they only serve soup for lunch and pull whatever is left at 3? This would mean they don't offer soup for dinner. No need to go on at this point and I hope somebody from the store sees this post. 

\"Soup. It's what SHOULD  be for dinner.\""}
{"text":"We have shopped at Smith's exclusively as visitors and now 100% since June.  Christmas Eve we bought a large order of groceries.  On Christmas morning we discovered that we did not have a small ($8.00) pork loin. We called the store but found it closed Christmas day. Today my husband returned to the store with the original receipt, and a receipt from Von's showing that we did purchase a replacement roast on Christmas Day.  After waiting patiently, he was told that the roast had not been noted on the \"log\". He was also told that the only way to prove that the meat was not bagged would be to review the video tapes from that day, which would take some time.  In frustration he left.  I called spoke to an assistant manger and was told that this was the store's policy.  Hmmm, OK Smith's ya just lost a loyal customer over an $8.00 roast.  Not good customer service."}

{"text":"My favorite Smiths period. Not the newest store around, hasn't been renovated with the newest layout and look but it's still my favorite for two reasons: 1) The Staff are awesome and you NEVER wait in a line that's more than 2 deep. They'll open a register immediately if even just to check out one person. 2) The selection. They have all I need and if I need something they don't have, they'll get it."}
{"text":"This store is horrible. The inside is dingy, unkempt and comparable to a Food for Less. I typically go to the Albertsons across the street because it is much nicer in all ways, but on occasion I've had to go to this Smiths for something out of the ordinary. One time I watched a young caucasion male \"manager\" inappropriately hug a customer. When she told him that was one rough hug he replied, \"You know you like it rough.\" Disgusted, angered, and embarassed by this, AND the fact that my young daughter had to see and hear this, we never went back. Raunchy store with raunchy employees."}
{"text":"A WORD OF WARNING!  I was in an aisle and suddenly slipped. There was liquid laundry detergent on the store floor and no warning signs.  I was injured from my fall. I went to urgent care and I had to buy crutches.  I also missed work days for which THEY DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HELP ME - Not even a puny \"we're sorry\" giftcard.  I waited well over a month for them to watch the security video.  They investigated the incident and decided to do nothing further.  I never asked for anything absurd, but I had hoped they would help with the out-of-pocket costs I incurred due to the injury in their store. I will be shopping elsewhere from now on due to my dissatisfaction with their customer care."}

{"text":"Near my house this Smith's is a hit or miss, since some visits the staff is friendly and helpful. Other times one cannot find a staff member or if you could they are all conversing and catching up on their busy lives. Usually ignoring us customers, forgetting that we pay their salary. 

The benefit of this store is that it is open 24/7. Believe it or not due to the economic issues a lot of businesses in Vegas are not open all the time, but they have extended hours and such. So this place is a godsend if one needs something because their prices are great and it's usually in stock."}
{"text":"Buying groceries isn't one of my favorite things to do, but it has to be done. When I just need an item or two I will stop into other shops but when I need a cart full of food, Smith's Food & Drug Center is where I go.

There is an Albertson's near my house that I could easily go to instead of Smith's...  I have found the prices to be better overall at Smith's though. 

The staff at Smith's is always very helpful as well. The meat slicers in the deli (mmmm, Boar's Head) and the stockers in the produce department are always nice and the cashiers are well trained and efficient.

Make sure to sign up for the Smith's Rewards program. They keep track of how much money you spend and every three months they mail out coupons for the items you bought most often as well as a coupon for dollars off your next purchase (it's directly related to how much you spent in that 3 months period)."}
{"text":"This establishment gets mixed reviews from me. The decider: what time you go.  

If you want a civilized, fairly calm grocery shopping experience then go early in the day. If you want absolute mayhem, anarchy and bedlam then go at night. 

In the day it's OK. Senior staff on duty that knows their jobs and the manager is there if you need him (an impressive and courteous fella). The lines move fast and the produce is fresh and piled high. 

At night it's clear that the B team is working and the clientele is a bit hazardous. Road rage and occasional fisticuffs in the parking lot.... and it's best to use the south doors and avoid the street roughs that wait impatiently at the service desk near the north doors to cash their dole checks and get money orders for the rent. 

So, in the early day it's fairly nice, 5 stars. At night it reminds me of the Bronx (and that ain't good), 0 stars. Averages out to a solid 3."}
{"text":"I only shop this Smiths when I need to pick up something quickly. I purchased a small container of Waldorf salad at the deli. Took it home and gave it to a family member. They took one bite of it and spit it out. It had been sitting in the deli case too long, the fruit went bad and wreaked of alcohol. I returned it to the store and got my money back. I told the attendant it was really old. He threw it away and refunded my money. I would suggest the deli be notified so this doesn't happen to anyone else. I'll never buy anything from that particular deli again. Normally I shop at the S. Buffalo store. I will drive the extra few miles there from now on 
knowing I will get fresh food and good customer service."}

Can't put my finger on why I don't love this location. There's nothing really to complain about....it's just a typical grocery store...no thrills but nothing seriously wrong."}
{"text":"I have always shopped at smiths so I was glad to see there was one kind of close to our new house. I like this Smiths but it is SO busy! I think it's because there aren't any other grocery stores in the area. I think they do a good job considering how busy they always are. I like that they usually have a quite a few check stands open. The workers are nice. The produce guy was kinda lame because he didn't know what a sugar snap pea was. No big deal though. So far, I'm happy with the store but I wish Smiths would build another store to lessen the chaos of this one. I love the free Friday download coupon! I love that they have the free produce for kids while you shop! This is a genius idea and it will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"The pharmacy here is a fucking joke. Come in to pick up a simple prescription and you'll be waiting for at least half an hour.

The store is clean and fresh for the most part.  One star.

Staff is friendly and helpful.  One star.

I found expired items in both the boxed pastries area, and dairy.  Minus one star.  And the Ice Cream tasted like freezer burn, minus one star."}

The staff is super friendly and finally when I look discombobulated trying to find something; there is always someone there to help you find what your looking for. I'm not lazy I'll look for crap and if I can't find it I expect some help. Plus the fruit and veggies always look good which is a plus in my book."}
{"text":"I have a huge issue with this store. First off staff has always been nice and store is clean. I agree with the other review unfortunately a lot of homeless but not as bad as the Albertsons down the street they sleep right in front of the entrance, but back to my issue. 

Please be aware when you get your groceries. Almost every time I have gone in I come home and something wasn't bagged or was not put in my cart and left behind. Bottle of wine , shredded chicken , bread , just to name a few things that are missing. And this is not cheap stuff. I bought recently shredded chicken 10 bucks worth ...never got it sure as heck was on my receipt though . I have had to go back and get wine they forgot to put in my cart a couple months ago. I mean I can't go through every grocery bag before I put it in my car .


But like I said store is clean and staff is always super nice - can you please just get all my groceries I paid for in my cart ???? If it was just one time I wouldn't be so harsh but I am almost to the point I will drive a little farther to another Smith's to make sure I get everything."}
{"text":"Thankful that this store was nearby as my go-to Smith's (closer to our place) was out of dog food and so my doggies got to eat that night! (We've been to this one before, except, I was in the car with our toddler son, at the time.) I am loving our new side of town, I must say!

It was night time, so their door was limited to just one for the entrance and exit. One side, upon entering, the right side, was lined with a long line of carts, so as to create a block. Did not see a security guard.  

I was able to get the last bag of \"Healthy Weight\" for our dogs. I also grabbed something for my lunch salad (some sections were empty, must be a night time thing). And a couple other things from an inside aisle I won't mention for my husband's upcoming birthday. Hint, it's sweet. Heehee.

Self- checkout was packed. I moved. I was able to get into the 15 items or less line. Fast checkout. The clerk was nice. The store, from what I saw, was clean. No crazies. No screaming babies. Steady flow of customers, told my hubby, the majority was asian, though it was all types represented. The parking lot looked more full (it is at a strip mall) than I saw customers inside (maybe they were all over?).   

Has a US Bank inside (atm as well). Also noticed that the gift cards were situated near the front door, which I thought was a bit odd."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid location. They are open 24/7, so you can do your shopping late at night when it's less crowded. They have everything you need. The produce is always full and fresh. The butchers are so friendly when we need something from the case. And all the shelves are well stocked. Use your Smith's card for extra savings throughout the store. My only complaint is that sometimes when we have our shopping trips late at night after work, the store smells like raw meat and their meat selection is lacking. I only have this problem at night, but if you go shopping during the day, you're golden. Don't forget to bring your recyclable bags."}
{"text":"The storage pet friendly animals are always welcome to the Spanish store however handicapped people are discriminated against and treated poorly pallets in the aisles rude vendors if your disabled you might want to rethink where you're shopping the store puts profits in front of people"}
{"text":"I love smiths first of all, but this trip I was at the deli counter getting a few types of meats. The girl wasn't in a hurry which is fine but then the line starts forming. There is another woman working at the prepared foods right behind the same counter, no customers and doesn't bother to help out at all. Ignores the line that is getting longer, and doesn't even let someone know that the other lady needs some help. I'm pretty patient, so I don't mind, but the people were seriously waiting for quite a while with another person over there that never acknowledged them and even more were lining up as I left. Just not very good service at the deli today"}
{"text":"This is my usual spot to shop for groceries, last minute things, and especially holiday stuff. Well today, I went in, with full intent to utilize my WIC benefits. I had a couple of extra items, that I purchased separately, but what really stood out about today was my cashier. She was patient and sweet, and went above and beyond her job duties. We had a whole ordeal about the milk not going through the WIC benefits part properly, so I would end up having to pay out of pocket. She took initiative and went ahead and exchanged the milk I had brought up with me out for the proper one, and really did change my entire shopping experience. I mean, she could've just said, oh well, it doesn't scan, you'll just have to pay for it. She was sweet and caring and it meant a lot that she went above and beyond to do something like that."}
{"text":"There seems to be a Smith's on every block in the outskirts of Vegas.

The pricing is reasonable, no complaints here.  The service was exceptional.  The meat guy was kind enough to go look in the back for more beef tenderloin cuts that were on sale and was very nice about it.  

Also, they have a build your own 6-pack of craft beers for $8.99 so worth it if you know the right kinds to include.  They had the red IPA from Stone, so you for sure get your money's worth! 

The self-checkout line though... why is the receipt so far to reach?!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here the service leaves something to be desired. I find the cashiers rude and unhelpful and for some reason always on break. \"Sir I'm closing/going on break and your just gonna have to use self check out\". Seriously, I have 10 gallons of water and someone is going to have to come over and enter it in for me. But never the less, I head over to self check out and wait for someone to come assist me. Then I'm told it's easier to use regular check out with the self serve water... Really?!? Didn't I just try that? Next time I'm just going to dump the 10 gallons on the floor and leave the clerk to clean it up on their break.  I'm done with this Smiths!"}
{"text":"While WalMart may be the largest grocer in America, some of us want something different. Like produce without mold or GMO offerings that aren't marked. A deli with someone smiling behind the counter. A meat department with someone working the counter that knows the difference between 80/20 and 94/6. And oh yes, speedy checkouts and self-checkout options. Kroger owns Smith's and while they might just be the second largest Grocery chain in America these days behind WalMart, they kick WalMart's rear end more often than not. Kroger has been a \"FULL SERVICE GROCER\" for a long time, and they still know how to do it right. 

Also for those who want to try their hand at extreme couponing, while Nevada doesn't have the double coupon deals like some states have, Smith's has helped me maximize my budget between my coupons and their sales and 10 for 10 deals. And I'm talking serious budget maximization. (Sorry, I don't share my secrets, please don't ask).

And one last thing: A quick breakdown of Southeast Henderson food shopping options goes like this. 

Whole Foods - Use for premium meat, supplements, chemical free soaps, etc. 
Albertsons: Excessively priced, high quality produce, pain in the rear checkouts. 
Vons: Once my favorite, they've slipped in selection and quality control. Produce is good, Bakery is very good. Deli is hit or miss. Checkout is the place where you cool your heels, don't go there in a hurry. 
Fresh & Easy: Small selection, slightly higher prices, seen produce and meat quality issues here. Check what you buy carefully. 
Winco: Gotta know your items and prices, has bulk items, you can save mega $$$ here, but service sucks and the store can be a ZOO, payment options are restricted, and you gotta bag your stuff. 
Cuevas: It's a Mexican Supermarket. And one of Henderson's hidden in plain site gems. But it's also a category all to itself. 

That leaves Smith's as the place to go when you just want to shop without hassle."}
{"text":"This store, by far, employs the most unintelligent, unhelpful, and blatantly rude/lazy staff I've ever seen in the Kroger family of stores. 

I actually had a self-check cashier who was too lazy to push a single button to clear my screen for me, and kept INSISTING that I wait for her to finish her social conversation, while lying to me and claiming she was helping some man that she wasn't talking to... (She was instead gossiping with two other customers/friends of hers.) 

Of course, I get stuck with such incompetence while I've got meat in my car, baking at 110 degrees. Not only did she refuse to do her job, but she refused to page a manager, and then attempted to incite a fight between myself and another customer. After I went and got the manager, I returned to find the woman gossiping about me to another customer who wasn't even involved. 

Spoke with the store director the next day. Explained the situation, was informed that it was not the first time this woman had behaved poorly and not followed procedure... yet she's still working there a month or two later. She also seems to have a penchant for sticking her nose in everyone else's business, because every time I see her, she's gossiping with someone about someone else in the store or about other customers. 

Thanks, but I'll take my business elsewhere. Don't need that shit when I'm trying to buy some groceries."}
{"text":"There is a bum currently sitting by the front doors, pan handling looking sad with his cardboard sign. I moved out to this side of town thinking i would see less of this, i thought wrong i guess. I brought it to the attention of an employee, and they were like oh whatever. Maybe I'll try Albertsons next time."}
{"text":"This store is a little bit out of my way but I am willing to drive here due to the clean store and fact that the shelves are always stocked with what I need. I typically go mid afternoon. There is a decent grocery crowd but I am able to maneuver the isles without issue because there is minimal in isle floor stands. They seem to always keep fresh foods in the produce and meat departments which is a big plus when you want to try to eat healthy. The staff is friendly and always willing to help me if I need to find a particular item. Overall great store, keep it up!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice Smiths. The store is clean & produce looks nice & fresh. No weird smell in the meat / seafood dept like some grocery stores, either! Also the employees are always friendly & willing to help (even with checking out @ 2:30-3:00 am, (when I stop after work). This is NOT the case @ the SILVERADO RANCH SMITH'S. I'm a big fan of the Fuel Rewards (which is why I also frequent the Green Valley loc-they have a Smith's Fuel Center) & the Most Valued Customer Appreciation coupons."}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty happy. Except for the cashier who is all in your grocery business. Today I did a late night shopping and was disappointed I had to check myself and bag all my groceries.  The machine likes to give you a major hard time. Looking up vegetables was a pain! Call button is ignored!"}
{"text":"Decent selection
Staff is usually friendly.
Need to pay attention to the process though.

{"text":"Although this location is not the closest to my home, I happened to shop here once in a while.  It is just as good as any other Smith's I've shopped at which is a good thing.  Friendly and fast customer service in the meat department and the marinated carne asada (when cooked at home) was good. Not as tender as I had hoped, but seasoned nicely.  The Smith's phone app has always worked for me and the stores have always had enough of the Friday Freebies.  The layout is clean and I can typically find what I'm looking for.  If you synchronize (choose a store location within the app)  the phone app with the Smith's you are actually shopping in, it will help you locate items by using the search protocol!  That feature has come in handy for me on quite a few occasions as not all Smith's are alike when it comes to said floor plan."}
{"text":"Always fresh produce and their seafood section ROCKS!  The meat section usually always has what I need as well.  They have a pretty great checkout system so I've never had to wait more than 1-2 people deep.  I love this Smith's."}
{"text":"Never have an issue with this store. Been shopping here for YEARS. Customer service is always on top of things! The associates love to help . I go out my way to still come to  this location. Keep up the good work ! And don't forget to check out the digital coupons ! They help me save a bunch ! ( I wish they took double coupons on coupons ;-) )"}
{"text":"This place has never done me wrong.  I love coming here because things are inexpensive and fresh.  From my pics, you can see how nice the produce was.  They had a great selection of meats, as they always do.  

What really made a great experience for me was the deli today.  I went to the deli because I wanted some fresh cut meats and cheeses for sandwiches at home.  The older lady that worked the counter was soooo sweet!  I really enjoyed her.  I chose a mesquite smoked turkey and a domestic provolone cheese, which she didn't have up front at the counter.  She told me she had to go in the back, so I apologized out of common courtesy and she made it very clear to me that it was her pleasure to get those items for me.  When she came back, she started to slice them and then stops midway.  She comes back to me at the counter and hands me a meat paper with a slice of both turkey and provolone.  Now I know reading this, you probably might think, \"big deal, she gave you a lunchable!\"  In life the small things mean the most to me and the fact that she wanted to let me try this as she finished, without asking me, meant a lot to me.  

Add in the fact that this place, like most places nowadays, has a self checkout, I'd say this grocery store is top knotch!  The food may not be top grade like a Whole Foods, but the service I got today was 2nd to none!"}
{"text":"There are certainly things you could dislike about this Smith's, such as the location, the always-packed parking lot, and how busy it gets. To me, however, this Smith's is a 4-star grocery store.

I find this Smith's offer a nice balance between the unbearable Walmart experience, and the high prices at Vons. Sure, it's usually busy here, but at least this location typically has ample checkers on hand. The lines generally move faster here than at Walmart or Vons, which is also a big plus.

In short, Smith's offers good prices, a relatively clean interior, and fast check-out lines. 

A recent remodel has improved the aesthetics inside considerably, although there is nothing they can do about the surrounding neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been so disappointed with all the Smith's here in Las Vegas/Henderson. I always stop by to cash my check, sometimes it works out but more often than not customer service is on break,  or they're not open.....at 9am, they aren't open. Absolutely ridiculous. I always intend to shop once I've cashed my check but 9/10 I have to take my check and shop, elsewhere. This consistently happens at the 3 Smith's near me. I keep going thinking it'll be different,  but I give up. I miss shopping at Smith's ( Dillions) in kansas, it's just a huge let down here."}
{"text":"I always buy my groceries here instead of walmart, haggens, Albertsons etc
They always have something on sale and its less crowded than walmart. They have a variety of fresh veggies and fruits. The bakery always makes fresh donuts aaaand fresh backed french bread. Don't go on the first day of the month, those are their packed days. 
Wed and thurs they have their meats on sale
Also gatorades are on sale for 69 cents...that's a good a$$ deal to me so stock up if you see them on sale. Then they'll raise the price to $1  each.
Use your free smiths card  to get shoppers discount. 
On special months they give out free samples or give you a free product when signing up for their credit card. 
You also get feul points, every dollar you spend they put points in your card for free or cheaper gas at their gas station or shell gas station."}
{"text":"Between the time of 10pm-11:30pm the evening staff are not helpful. 
One particular attendant was veey unprofessional the way she acted when a customer needed help. 
Her description is a light skinned black girl that wears a neon vest. When (I) the customer needed help she just stood there by the screen rolling her eyes making attitude faces like she don't want to be bothered. Very lazy employee need to be fired. 
A pregnant lady was walking to the atm and she didn't move to the other side to give space for the pregnant lady to get to the atm. 
Evening staffs at this Smith store are not well-trained to deal with error transactions especially when dealing with cash back. One would say cashback available to $100, then later on same employee will say no cashback we can't do it. I can't help you. 

I am not going back to this store. Very disappointing and was stressful  too. Since i accidentally left merchandise necause of the cashback commotion and even with receipt they can't help me reimbursed what i purchased or replaced it. 
There were 4 employees and no one ask the customers if they got everything with them.

Walmart employees customer service are way better than Smith's."}
{"text":"Having a grocery store within walking distance of your house is a luxury that people often take for granted. Having a few of them within the same distance is a blessing that I will appreciate beyond belief. 

Smith's might not be my first choice for groceries, but I will go in from time to time to compare them to the competitor across the street and when I am too lazy to go to TJ.

I like that I can get in and out without much hassle and once in a while they have some great pantry stocking sales."}
{"text":"I came in on the fly to get some thin, strip steak for our Steak Pizzaiola, and the gentleman in the meat department was very helpful, in helping me locate the choice of meat that I needed! Very friendly face, mature gentlemen, great work!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here after work to pick up a couple of things and oh my goodness!!! There was an item I needed and there was an employee in the aisle who was stocking (I won't say in what section as I don't want to embarrass him) who had such bad body odor!!!  I tried holding my breath as I looked for what I needed but the odor was too much. I honestly thought I would puke. I said to my boyfriend who was at the other end of the aisle and told him I can't get what I need cause that dude smells too bad and my boyfriend said \"yeah, I know. I can smell him from here\".

We went to another part of the store to get the other things I on my list but before we went to pay, I decided to look down the aisle to see if the guy was gone and he was. I started walking down the aisle and I could still smell him!!!  His odor lingered in the air! Disgusting!!!

I don't think I'll go back to this store. I'm surprised his manager or coworkers didn't say anything to him about his body odor.

Take a shower, dude! Use deodorant!"}
{"text":"The inside definitely doesn't match the outside! I have been to this location many times in the last but was hesitant to come back because the last time I was here, the inside did match the outside.

I think they may have done some major remodeling inside because it looks amazing in here. I mean it is clean and very well organized. While I was shopping I felt at home and loved the selections they had which is what I've come to expect from a Smitty's. I haven't a reason not to shop this location in the future based upon the upgrades they have done inside. I apologize if the updates were done a long time ago. As mentioned, haven't shopped here in years. I would go out on a limb and even say this location looks better than the one I sometimes shop on Sunset and Sunset. Glad I stopped by!"}
{"text":"I came here at 11:15pm with my husband and brother-in-law. My husband went to get a shopping cart. An employee named Sara, who claimed that she was the manager, told my husband that he couldn't have a shopping cart. Then she followed us through the store (until we reached the back of the store) and taunted him with a cart. As soon as his back was turned, she said loudly, \"he doesn't have the balls to face me.\" Then she walked away. I followed her and said very politely, \"excuse me, excuse me, ma'am.\" She completely ignored me and walked away, like literally through the entire store. Another cashier told her, \"there's a customer you're ignoring.\" Sara said, \"I'm not talking to that bitch.\"

I told her that I didn't appreciate the way she spoke to my husband and that her behavior was unprofessional. She told me to speak with the manager. I said, \"I'd love to.\" And then she smiled a big broad smile and said, \"I'M THE MANAGER.\" 

When we went to check out, she continued to harass my husband. When I told her I video'd her bad behavior, she offered to let us use her employee discount. Um, no thanks, crazy. 

Do yourself a favor and don't shop here unless you want unwarranted harassment from a crazy person."}

{"text":"I used to live in Henderson and thought this Smith's would be like the one by Horizon Ridge, but it totally isn't. It's smaller or - I don't know, it doesn't look as well cared for or something.  I only go here because it's close to me and sells the groceries I need.  Staff are pretty decent and the place is usually clean. I wish they had more cashiers, though, and more staff bringing in carts. 

 There's this one kid doing the bagging who is so funny- he's naturally humorous and relates to the customers well.  Good job, kid. He's going places."}
{"text":"None better in the valley. Every possible good thing I can think of to say about a business. We had a problem at Thanksgiving with a turkey. No hoops to jump through. Just go to the check out and tell them to give you whatever you want. It worked . We have employees and managers jumping to open new check outs the manager is a ball of fire tiny little thing that is just a pleasure to be around. SERVICE with a capital S is the theme for this Store. Congratulations to all employees at this location you are all wonderful !!!"}
{"text":"This store from the outside looks like a dump.  It very nice inside. Been shopping there for  a while. I went in this week with my 2 little ones and mistakenly knocked over a cardboard display. The department manager gave me this crazy look. She realized I was sorry and the other gal working ran over to help so she did too. She always seems busy and not so eager to help. I love the people in the deli and the gal Stacey in the cheese/snack aisle is super friendly and very helpful. I also like the young man in diary...craig .  This gal's name is candy...soyr candy that is. The store manager patty is super nice and so are the women at the pharmacy"}
{"text":"Friendly service and always accommodating with my students who have disabilities.  Great place to shop."}
{"text":"I am just not a fan of this place.  The parking lot sucks.  It's really tight and whoever designed it should be shot.  Everytime I have ever been inside, the meat/seafood department smells horrible.  There is no chance I will ever buy any fresh meat or seafood there. 

My Mom loves this store, however, so we do stop here every now and then.  She seems to find good deals - most recently I was making a pumpkin cheesecake and needed cream cheese, so she ran in and was able to find cream cheese on sale (Kroger Brand) 10 for $10. Pretty decent. 

Overall I think the store seems to be pretty old and run down, and I've seen some pretty shady characters in the parking lot.  I live less than a block from an Albertson's, and for convenience and cleanliness alone, I will pay a little bit higher prices.  Sorry, Smith's."}
{"text":"Every week when I need fresh produce and snacks for my meal preps, I prefer Smith's over other competing supermarket company. I never had issues with cleanliness, staff, parking, or the products they advertise. 
This review will be based on my multiple experiences I have encountered with Smith's Clicklist Pickup:

Pros: If you're short on time and already know what you plan to buy, I highly recommend to go with this stress-free system. You shop online, pay what you owe, reserve a pickup time at the Smith's store that does this service, park at their designated stall, and wait for them to load your vehicle with your groceries. Whoever came up with idea I will marry them because this is such a convenience for me and others who are limited on time. I've been timing their service and literally takes no more than 5 minutes. Granted, if all your items are available than you are out of the parking lot in no time. However, the items that may not be available will be substituted for a similar product. If you choose not to make a substitution then that item is off your cart and you don't pay for it. Their customer service is exceptional.

Cons: I do have to say that parking can be a hassle at times. You have incoming and outgoing traffic from the nearby gas station, restaurants, and stores nearby and the Clicklist Parking just so happens to land in front of all that traffic. Luckily, you have a one-hour window to pick up your groceries! 

Tips:
1) Service fee is free for your first 3 orders. On the 4th order, the service fee is $4.95.
2) Have any questions in general? Here is the website URL:
https://www.smithsfoodanddrug.com/topic/clicklist
3) You may use paper coupons but it will add more time to your pickup experience. I recommend using the digital coupons since they are automatically added to your total. Digital coupons can be found under the \"Savings\" tab beneath the Smith's Logo. 
4) Very Important! They do not accept cash, checks. and gift cards. Only debit and credit cards!"}
{"text":"My first job ever was bagging groceries. It doesn't take much to get the job.. Just a little common sense and an open schedule. Kids are lacking the sense part these days!

Do not eff with me and my produce. And by \"eff with my produce\" I mean please respect it like you would a baby and don't smash it with heavy stuff. Every time... no matter how I send my groceries down the conveyer, the teens at this location are guaranteed to put some cans in with your bread and put your coffee on top of your bananas. I suggest you be aggressive and bag yourself if you like your food bruise free.

Also the beer selection sucks."}
{"text":"Very large. Not particularly impressed by the selection. The good news is that the prices are pretty good--I do think they're a little cheaper than some of the other places around. Cleanliness is so-so. So, A for price, D for selection, C for cleanliness...that's 3 stars."}
{"text":"This use to be the perfect place to get in and out easily. Now it's extremely busy at all hours! What changed you may ask?? Well food for less that was about a mile up the street closed in January. Which caused a huge spike in business here. If you are looking for a place that is not a Walmart and that has a good quality of food this is the right place. Prices are alittle high but meats and bakery is a great start here. Will continue to come here since I don't care to stop at the biggest store for groceries. But maybe I should choose a different hour of the day then  around dinner time."}
{"text":"I have an update ! 
Do not EVER pay your utilities here. The line moves like molasses. God bless the poor girl who works this area but every time I've come here to pay my power I have waited over 30 mins. It just seems like she has no clue. Some kind of disaster is always happening at that desk. I waited a few months and went back and the case is still the same. Clueless unproductivity.... seriously fuck this location it fails on all aspects."}
{"text":"Stopping off at the store again for fresh stuff that I can't keep for too long. 
I am looking at getting yorgurt, bread for sandwich, milk and some kind of fruit. 
I have to be good with my diet and watch my glucose, so I am trying to get fresh item to eat daily.
I know sale items starts today on Wednesday,  hope they some good deals for me to make other meals during the rest of the week.
Smiths Store is pretty easy to shop at as they are a few of the stores left that have self check out  in the store. I know VONS and Albertsons in my area has taken those lanes out. It is a pain when you only have a few item to check out and wanna go.
plus using the Smith rewards card can help on your gas pending o  your shopping dollars. more you spend of course the better your rewards at the pump will be. 
And I have to get a gift card for a gift and they have everything under the sun as for gift cards to, so even more convenient to shop at."}
{"text":"Logan in the Bakery went out of his way and made 2 loafs of fresh Garlic Bread for me , old school Great service never goes out of style."}
{"text":"I guess as far as grocery stores go, I like this one the best in Vegas...at least it's not plugged up with electric scooters and screaming idiots on the 1rst and 15th like Walmart, but don't fall for free newspaper trick by the Review Journal..they will tell you off big time of you don't want to hear their subscription sales pitch!"}
{"text":"It may sound a bit petty but I'm annoyed with their customer service desk. They stay open until 7 and it's what the sign posted says. I pay my utilities there. Well I've gone there 3 times between 5 and 6 and it was closed. I finally decided to go across the street to Albertsons. I don't like shopping there but I have to go there to pay my bills. I used to like smiths because  my bank is there, I do my shopping and pay my bills in one store. Now I'm a little irritated. It's just bad service to close 1-2 hours early on a regular basis yet your sign states 7."}
{"text":"Review focused on ClickList-

Wow!! The staff in charge of ClickList here is phenomenal!! Melissa and Nicole have gone above and beyond to get me through a stressful morning that was due to my technological user error, but they treated me so kindly and were patient and insanely helpful even though it was not their issue at all! Cannot thank these ladies enough for their kindness! I go weekly to pick up my groceries each Saturday morning. It has certainly become a busy time, but they never treat you with stress or rush things. They do everything the right way, ensure eggs are in the front seat, ask where things should go- trunk or seats, SHOW you the substitutes and explain everything so well along the way. Seriously saves me so much time and stress as an expecting mother with a toddler to care for!! 

Bravo to the supervisor Melissa, and her amazing staff - highlighting Nicole especially, as she is our regular girl each week and always so friendly to me and my daughter! We appreciate your kindness and hard work!! I recommend ClickList to all my fellow mom friends. It's such a life saver!"}

{"text":"The staff in the bakery rock! Thanks for all the wonderful cakes you make for us here at Las Vegas Dissemination Company. All the employees love the cakes you bake for us:) Yay! Great cake, staff, quality and reliability! Mary Irby Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Went to track down the Friday Freebies that are piling up on my Smith's card. Knowing that they are usually out of them or hidden in the store made me grumpy but I persevered. 
I found one item where it should be on the shelf but the other was missing. I poked around up front and found a display with the missing item! Nice that this store places some of the Friday Freebies up front. I shall try to remember that!"}
{"text":"Good prices, and they opened a check stand just as we go in line and they do this all the time. Nice clerks and the selections are great. Oh and SALE ON Gatorade"}
{"text":"Recently I've noticed a lot of homeless people soliciting in the Smith's shopping center recently but to have one  sleeping right in front of the entrance for over 30mins. I was going to wake him up on my way out but now days you never know with people. But overall still a good place to shop, they just need to talk to someone about the issue."}
{"text":"Good prices and better products. Kroger brand is tough to beat. This location is 24-hour also makes best choice to shop!"}
{"text":"This Smith's location is just ok. It's definitely showing its age and is incredibly dated but the service and selection was decent. 

I can't say I will make this a regular grocery stop but if you live in the area you could do worse in a store."}
{"text":"This store is scary.  The employees block aisles in the middle of the day.  The vendors yell back and forth,  mostly the bro bro guys. Talked to Bryan today... The manager while he stared at me like a chicken, hands crossed and seemingly very tense.  I pointed this out and he stayed frozen all clenched up until I left weirede out again by this store.  Closest to my home but geez"}
{"text":"Friendly staff!  Well worth having the member reward card for your key chain with the ticket specials offered daily.   Weekly meat specials on certain days, ask in the meat department for best days for catching awesome deals!!  

A lot of variety in all departments.  Store is always very clean and easy to navigate.

Only negatives I have found are 2 products which I haven't been able to find in stock ever here:  blue bell ice cream and boathouse chai tea latte"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy shopping at the Smiths on west Charleston but lately it seems they are out of stock on the main items I'm going there to buy.  Example: Zevia canned soda. It was on sale for $3.99 so went to pick up a few six packs and of course the cola was out.  I went to customer service and stood in line to get a Raincheck for when it's in stock again.  I was told the truck would deliver more that night.  The next morning I went back...no Zevia cola.  I have been been back to that store numerous times over the past few weeks and no Zevia cola.  I guess I either give up or try a different Smiths store.  Why issue a raincheck if you never have the product in stock? Grrrrrrr"}
